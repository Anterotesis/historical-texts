            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

So that now the meaning of the text is that although All mighty God had done great things for Judah, and Israel, yet this benefit exceeded all the rest, that the Lord had provided a faithfull ministry, not onely extrordinary, but such as were raysed from the posterity of his people by his blessing upon the schooles of learning and meanes of education, to be separated unto God and set apart for the work of God in the salvation of mens souls.</p>

It is a greater mercy then the Lord shewed to his people in leading them through the wilderness forty yeares, though herein there was the angel of Gods presence that went before them in the pillar of cloud and fire, that directed them and kept them in all their way, yet neither was that mercy comparable to that in the text, for that was mainly an outward help, for notwithstanding that there were six hundred thousand of them, whose car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casses fell in the wilderness, but in this spirituall mercy Eternall destruction is prevented, this ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore exceeds all the rest, and there is an other kind of the Lords presence walking in the midst of the golden candlesticks, which brings us to spirituall &amp; everlasting peace, and mercy in the ministry of Gods servuants.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Reason</hi> 1. <hi>This must needs be a great blessing,</hi> Because the ministry is purchased at so high a rate, and the business was so great to set it up, now the providing of an able, and faithfull ministry cost much, and it was a mighty busynes to set it up. <hi>Ephe.</hi> 4. 8. <hi>Christ ascended up on high and led cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity captive, &amp; gave gifts unto men:</hi> first that Christ must not only descend into the lower parts of the earth, but he must ascend into heaven farr above all principallityes and powers 2. He must lead captivity captive, that is over sin, sathan, and what soever had led us away captive, to do this. if all the powers of darknes could binder it, there should never haue been a faithfull ministry set up, therfore Christ must captivate all these for this end, this sheweth the blessing to be exceeding great, that so great a means was requisite for the procuring of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reason</hi> 2. There is in the same place annexed an other reason to prove the greatness of this blessing; taken from the excellency of the end of it, <hi>ver:</hi> 11. 12. <hi>He gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, &amp; some Evangelists, and some Pastours and Teachers, for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istry, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000040_0013_0F9F1994EE0E7B48"/>
that it concerns both the gathering and building up and the eternall salvation of the elect:</p>
            <p>Object: <hi>it will be said,</hi> that this was but for a short time, that the Apostles and Prophets and Evangelists did continue,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ:</hi> But we have the writings of the Apostles Prophets and Evangelists to the end, and we must have Ordinary ministers, Pastours and Teachers, <hi>till we all come into the unity of the faith, and the knowledg of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ,</hi> that is, to the end of the world, and the consu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mation of all things, and therefore it is an hellish delusion to conceive that the ministry should be lost quite and dissanulled, by Antichristian superstition, for this assertion doth plainly annihilate both the Church and saints, and any farther salvation of any souls, which were impious to conceive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reas.</hi> 3. I may reason from the difficulty of the work, &amp; the calling of the Prophets &amp; Nazerites, it is a very high dignity, for our sons &amp; young men to be advanced unto, it is such a dignity as God only can bestow, and such as they be raised up by God himself unto it, the Prophet is the name of Seers, 1 <hi>Sam:</hi> 9. 9. they have better eyes then other men, they are the men of God, (as the mountains of God, and Cedars of God are so called) by way of excellency, the persons that have more of God in them then other men, they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

little, he hath added this in <hi>raysing up of our sons to be Prophets &amp;c:</hi> he hath wonderfully erected Schools of learning, and meanes of education for our children, that there might be continually some comfortable supply &amp; succession in the Ministry, Is it not so O ye people of God in New-England?

            <p>Now all this unthankfulnes is found in many, and in some measure some in all at this day, for this great blessing of the Ministry &amp; the means of the continual success and succession therin.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Many will not acknowledg the mercy, but pass it by as a matter of litle or no worth: the great blessing of a painfull Ministry is not regarded by coveteous earth-wormes, neither do the schools of learning, that afford oyl to the lamps, come into their thoughts or language to prayse the Lord for them, this is that sin reproved in Israel <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 6. <hi>Neither said they where is the Lord that brought us out of the land of Egipt?</hi>

should have less to do with the world &amp; worldly delights, and be less eumbred then others with the affaires of this life. 2. In separation, there is imployed a <hi>dedication unto the Lord,</hi> things that were o' old separated, were <hi>dedicated &amp; devoted</hi> to an holy use, as the Lord speaks of the Levites; <hi>Numb:</hi> 16. 9. <hi>The God of Israel hath separated you from the Congregation of Israel to bring you neer unto himself:</hi> thus Hannah dedicated her first born unto the Lord 1. <hi>Sam:</hi> 1. 18. So are ye to be as persons devoted to the Lord. 3. There must be qualification with <hi>Holyness,</hi> other things sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated unto the Lord as the vessels of the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> and <hi>ministry,</hi> had a kind of <hi>relative holyness</hi> but in persons seperated there should be <hi>inherent holyness,</hi> students &amp; especially ministers should have holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness upon their foreheads, that is, professed &amp; prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised and visible unto all. Thus you may see what it is to be a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> and what ye should ayme at in your studyes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence students should be instructed how they may attain to these excellencyes, &amp; how they, may be had: for here we see that it was the Lord himself that raised up these young ones to be <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> and <hi>Nazarites:</hi> &amp; it is not either your own study or parts, nor the teaching and instruction of others, that can possibly rayse you up out of that dunghill wherin youly, to this degree to be true <hi>Prophets</hi> of the Lord, but it is the Lord himself that
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:000040_0026_0F9F19A046A93728"/>
must put underneath you his everlasting armes to rayse you up: therefore it concernes students to be much in prayer unto the Lord: dayly and duely to draw neer unto the Lord, to beg of him the spirit of wisdom, and <hi>revelation,</hi> and a blessing upon, and assistance in your studyes, prayer was one of <hi>Luthers</hi> maisters, and it was but reason that the priest should <hi>first offer up sacrifice for his own sins, and then for the sinns of the people, Hebbr:</hi> 7. 27. first seek God for themselves, and then make intercession for others.</p>
            <p>But now by the way, some may object, here the Example of the <hi>Nazarites</hi> that they nourished their hair, <hi>they were not to suffer any raisor to come upon their heads, aureng the time of their seperation, Numb:</hi> 6, 5. here is a fair plea for students, and ministers to wear long hair.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ,</hi> Because that this objection comes fair and full in my way give me leave to answer this objection, there is some need of it, and take it thus.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

(if persons be not quite past shame</hi>) for men to weare long hair: here is a wide difference between the old <hi>Nazarites</hi> and students now.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>Nazarites</hi> did nourish their hair out of obedience unto God and holy devotion, wheras persons in these dayes do it out of pride, vain-glory effeminacy, and the like sinfull motives, and for sinister ends.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They only amongst the people of God did nourish it, &amp; none else therefore this example doth evidently prove that all the rest of Gods people in the old Testament yea the Priests and Levites did not nourish their haire, so Christians are now to cut their hair unless they can find any where (which was never yet found) that the Commandment of the Lord hath allowed it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Nazarites were to nourish all their hair alike,</hi> they were not to cut off some part, and to leave long locks hanging down, as is practised by some now a dayes.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>Nazarites were to nourish their hair to burn it,</hi> Numb: 6. 18. But students &amp; ministers &amp; professours in these dayes nourish their hair to keep them from all deminution, it were much better they were burnt.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Nazarites nourishing of their hair was to <hi>difference them from the common sort:</hi> but now the nourishing of the hair, is to hold corresponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with ruffains &amp; swagge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> It is true that the Lord hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den unto men long hair, but what is long hair? can any man prescribe out of the word of God any set size for mens hair? if this cannot be done, why should any be offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded at our hair as if it were long This objection hath been made by some, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally stood upon, therefore it is a fit season to give some answer to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ:</hi> 1. This is most cleer that long hair (if menkind do wear it) is contrary to the word of God, &amp; to nature, &amp; shamefull as was said before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is no small reproach to the Lord aad his word, to find fault with long hair, and yet that he should not give us to understand which is long hair but that every man still is left to his liberty, to wear his hair as long as he lists; this makes the Trun pet to give an u<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>certain sound which the Lord approves not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That he that would keep a good conscience in such cases &amp; controversies, wherin there appears any doubt, will make choise of the surer part, that is that part wherin he may be sure not to sin against the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>: so will be do in this case about the length of hair, short hair we may be sure will neither offend God nor good men, but long hair may and doth offend both: therefore be sure that God do 
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:000040_0029_0F9F1AC740C6BEE8"/>
not account thy hair long.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Christians are bound to <hi>abstain from all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of evill.</hi> 1 Thes. 5. 22.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Christians are to do <hi>whatsoever is of good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> Phil. 4. 8. But long hair in menkind hath great <hi>appearance of evill,</hi> and is of <hi>evill report.</hi>

            <p n="7">7. Christians should <hi>give no offence to others,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. But this long hair <hi>gives offence,</hi> 1. As <hi>giving an ill example to others,</hi> who are often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by their ill president &amp; example to imitate &amp; second them in their guise.

S. Simpson</hi> allowes schooles of the prophets wherin Christian religion is taught, <hi>but against schooles of humane learning this is that that makes them Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christs, seeing they are contrary to, and do oppose Christ, this makes the universityes stews of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, houses of lyes, and to stinke before God with most loath some abomination &amp;c:</hi> with a multitude of other reproachfull terms which Luther &amp; others have loaded Popish Universityes withall.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. I do much desire that the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers of schools &amp; universityes would speak plainly what they mean by humane learning, then wee should easily come to some conclusion. Therfore let this distinction be premised, that humane learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may either be taken for all that learning that the heathen Authours or philosophers have deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their writings: or else all other Arts besides Theology, as they call <hi>physicks, ethicks, politicks</hi> &amp;c: take in also the grounds of languages, <hi>Latine Greek &amp; Hebrew.</hi> Now in the former sense, if <hi>Mr. D.</hi> do mean by humane learning, all that learning that the heathen men have uttered out of the light of nature: It will be a great oversight to pass such a sentence upon it. 1. Because we find in Scriptures, some testimonies out of humane writers, 29 <hi>

               </gap> 2. There are certain principles of

trueth written, even in corrupt nature, which hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then authors have delivered unto us, that doe not cross the holy writ, 1 <hi>Cor:</hi> 11. 14. <hi>doth not nature it self teach you &amp;c:</hi> and it cannot be denyed that all trueth, whosoever it be that speakes it, comes from the God of truth, as he is called severall times And who can deny but that there are found many excellent &amp; divine morall truths in <hi>Plato, Aristotle Plutarch, Seneca &amp;c:</hi> and to condemn all pel-mel, will be an hard censure, especially to call universi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Antichrists for reading of them. Besides they have treated of the works of God, most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently in many places, and the works of God ought to be <hi>declared by parents to their children,</hi> Psal. 78. 2—6. Besides they have delivered many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent sayings of God, and have attested many Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture historyes, as might be shewed by severall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, out of <hi>Justine, Tacitus &amp;c:</hi> and <hi>Mr. D.</hi> is not ignorant of them, shall all these be thrown away as antichristian, or as lyes?.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But they have much profaness and filthiness in them, and besides they are made idolls of in our universities, when as <hi>

               <hi>Answ.</hi> But 1. All heathenish writers, have not such profaness in them. 2. Those that have, let them be condemned &amp; abhorred, &amp; let not youth be poysoned by them. 3. Let God be true &amp;

            </p>
            <p n="2">II. But now if humane learning be taken in the second sense, for all those Arts that are commonly taught in Universities, as <hi>Physicks, Ethicks, Politicks Oeconomicks, Rhetorick, Astronomy &amp;c:</hi> or also for learned tongues of <hi>Latine, Greek, and Hebrew &amp;c:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I will be bold to affirm, that these in the true sense and right meaning therof are Theologicall &amp; Scripture learning, and are not to be accounted of as humane learning. For who can deny, that the first &amp; second chapters of <hi>Genesis,</hi> and many chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in <hi>Job,</hi> and the <hi>Psalms,</hi> and diverse other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of holy Scripture, do afford excellent and sure grounds for natural Philosophy, and a just systeme thereof: which <hi>Mr. Zanchy, Daneus,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse other eminent Divines have opened &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared unto us?

And where are there such high straines of all sorts of <hi>Rhetoricall Tropes, &amp; figures,</hi> to be found in any Author, as there are in the writings of the <hi>Prophets &amp; Apostles?</hi> and who can imagine, but that the

best &amp; surest Chronology in the world, is to bee found in holy Scriptures, upon which all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of times in all ages in the world depends?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let all judicious men consider, what <hi>Mr. Dell</hi> graunts, though he speakes so much against humane learning: I will relate his own words, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his books are in few hands, &amp; they that have them build much upon his judgment. He speaks thus in his treatise of the reformation of learning.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>I conceive it meet, that the Civill power, or chief Magistrate, should take great care of the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of youth, as one of the greatest works that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them, and one of the worthyest things they can do in the world, insomuch, that what the youth now is the whole Common wealth will shortly be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To this end it is meet, that Schools (if want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) be Erected through the whole nation, and not only in Citties &amp; great Towns, but also (as much as may be) in lesser villages: and the Authority of the Nation take great care, that godly men especially have the charge of greater schools, And that the Magistrate afford to this work suitable incouragement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That in Cittyes &amp; greater Towns, where are the greater schools, and greater opportunities to send children to them, they teach them also, the Latine &amp; Greek, tongues, &amp; Hebrew also which ought to be had in great account with us, for the old Testament sake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>It may be convenient also, that there be some Universities &amp; Colledges, for instructing in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg

of the liberall Arts, beyond Grammer &amp; Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick; as in Logick, which may be of good use in humane things, if reason manage that art of reason But the Mathematicks especially are to be had in good esteem in Universities, as Arithmetick, Geometry, Geography and the like, which as they carry to wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness in them; so are they besides very usefull in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Societies, and the affaires of this present life: There may be also in these Universities &amp; Colledges, allowed the studyes of Physick, &amp; the Law &amp;c:</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Why the Universities &amp; Colledges should bee only at Cambridg &amp; Oxeford, I know no reason: and we judg it most prejudiciall to the common good of the Common-wealth, that these two Universities should make a monopoly of humane learning to themselves. Doubtless it would be more suitable to a Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and more advantagious to the good of all the people, to have Universities or Colledges, one at the least in every great Town, or Citty in the Nation, as in London, York, Bristow, Exceter, Norwich &amp; the like: And for the State to allow to these Colledges an honest &amp; competent maintenance, for some godly and learned men to teach the Tongues &amp; Arts under a due reformation.</hi> Thus much <hi>Mr. Dell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all which it appears, that multitudes are deceived concerning this, as if <hi>Mr. D.</hi> did utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemn Universities or schools of learning, or that which is called humane learning, seeing that there is no art or tongue studyed or taught in Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges

but he allowes (though with caution) and also he desires there were more schools, Colledges &amp; Universities then there are.

Luke 4. Mat: 13. 54, 55. <hi>Besides when he would send forth preachers into all the world, he chose Fishermen, Publican, Tent makers, plain men, and of ordinary imployment in the world, and only put his Spirit upon them</hi> Acts 2. 17. <hi>This argument is much stood upon by</hi> Mr. Home, <hi>&amp;</hi> Mr. Crandon <hi>against</hi> M.

            <p>

               </gap>lous mistake to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from our Saviour Christ &amp; his Apostles to these times: For our Saviour received the Spirit not by measure <hi>John</hi> 3. 24. and the Apostles had the miraculous &amp; visible &amp; extraordinary gifts of the Spirit bestowed on them Acts 2. So the reason will stand thus. If our Saviour Christ and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, without other learning, by the miraculous
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:000040_0043_0F9F1AD4438DF150"/>
and extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, were enabled and furnished sufficiently for the ministry; Then other ministers in after times (that have no such extraordinary gifts) need no other learning, but the unction of the Spirit, as if he should say, if Aholiab &amp; Bezaleel were filled with the Spirit of God in wisdom, and in knowledg, and all manner of workmanship, to devise cunning works, (as they were <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 3, 4.) then no man need to be an apprentice to learn any Mechanicall trade, seeing the teaching of the Spirit is sufficient for any cunning work, who is there that would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count this reasoning ridiculous? Surely if Mr. D. had not excluded Logick &amp; reason out of Divinity he would neuer have made such collections: It is much like his reasoning in an other Sermon of his, the Scripture saith that Christ shall Baptise with the holy Ghost, &amp; with fire, therfore there is no baptism with water to be used, or to be in force.

            <p n="2">2.

               <hi>Answ.</hi> It is to be feared that <hi>Mr. D.</hi> hath been trained with humane learning, as in some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his opinions, so in writing of these things Let the reader remember what approbation hee gave to humane learning before, that he would have it taught, not only in Universities, but in all Citties &amp; villages: and yet he hath now so forgot himself, that though for humane &amp; civill ends, he did allow it, yet now he saith, <hi>that it is enmity to Christ crucified, and contrary to the word of the cross &amp;c:</hi> wherin let the indifferent reader observe with me a few particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If Mr. Dell had allowed the use of <hi>Logick</hi> in Divinity, how should he have dared to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed any of these humane arts, or languages for any end whatsoever?

            <p n="2">2. Antichrist himself &amp; his adherents, take in all the rabble of locusts crawling out of the smoak of the bottomless pit, take in all the popish tyrants and all the devills in hell, (for these are all such as are in the world) yet according to Mr. Dells Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, were never such <hi>introducers, or favourers &amp;c: of antichrists kingdom,</hi> were never such <hi>enemies to Christ crucified, or the word of his cross,</hi> never brought in so much <hi>hypocrisie, superstition, false doctrine, false worship &amp;c:</hi> as humane learning, &amp; yet how can he in any sense, allow of any humane learning, or desire more Universities or Colledges, would he have more Antichrists, more Devills <hi>&amp;c:</hi> hath not that man laid aside naturall Logick, and common sense &amp; honesty, and put off his forehead that writes thus?</p>

               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:000040_0048_0F9F183E2ABB2DB0"/>3. Wheras he saith that humane learning is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a hinderance, then an help to the ministry of the Gospel, and to all christianity; Let us consider a little what truth there is in this assertion, to let pass what I said before.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I will premise what <hi>Mr. Crandon, &amp; M.

To have these &amp; such things brought into the translatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of the Scripture, would stumble a godly heart that knows the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therof, as the rawest piece of humane learning put in for Scripture, which Mr. H. swallowes.</p>
            <p>Now let me add what <hi>Mr. Crandons</hi> judgment

            <p n="1">1.

            <p>There is somewhat more in <hi>Horn, &amp; Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> which I shall be brief in, because as they state the question I should not contend with them.</p>
            <p>Mr. Horn thus, <hi>That the study of Philosophy (though lawfull to be known, and in some points use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full yet) is not necessary to the preachers or preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Gospel, nor the key of knowledg, without which men cannot understand, or profitably hold forth the Trueths of Christ to others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not denyed, but what is necessary to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may be both understood &amp; preached, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the help of Philosophy, it is enough if it bee lawfull &amp; usefull, (<hi>ad bene ormelius esse</hi>) which is graunted by him.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Mr. Cr.</hi> in his preface against <hi>Baxter,</hi> states the question thus. <hi>That humane learning is of no force to decide, judg, and conclude any thing in questions meerly evangelicall, such is justification, and all other Gospel-graces, and priviledges.</hi> I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that <hi>Mr. Cr.</hi> shall neither have <hi>Mr. Baxter,</hi> nor any protestant writer his adversary in that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion.

man above God, But for all this, these Revere<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d men bring arguments that goe as farr in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing all humane learning, as <hi>Mr. Dell</hi> hath done. Let mee breifly see the strength of them.</p>
            <p>Hora. <hi>If Philosophy, Physicks &amp;c: had been needfull for furnishing of men to the Gospel, then Christ our Saviour, who came to teach us the mind of God, and to set on foot the preaching of the Gospel, would have delivered those sciences unto us, at least a more perfect form of them then the Philosophers did or could: But he did not so &amp;c: therefore they are not needfull &amp;c:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Take the force of this reason a <hi>pari,</hi> thus if the knowledg of the <hi>Greek &amp; Latine</hi> languages, had been needfull for furnishing men to the Gospel in all ages, then Christ would have taught those languages, and made <hi>Grammers</hi> for the learning of them, at least in a more perfect form then any <hi>Grammarians</hi> did or could &amp;c: but he hath not done so, therefore &amp;c: would any wise man think this to be a good consequence: yet the case is much alike; for both the Original tongues, and the arts &amp; sciences are like prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives siting persons to the preaching of the Gospel, (for that is meant by furnishing men to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel) But God is pleased to give to the sons of men to be exercised with labour &amp; study, in this and other kinds <hi>Eccles:</hi> 1. 13.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Christ hath delivered to us those sciences (as
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:000040_0053_0F9F1838C570AF58"/>
farr as is needfull) in a more perfect form, then any <hi>Philosophe</hi> of old hath done, there was never such a method of <hi>Physicks or naturall Philosophy,</hi> as is set down in the order of the works of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor ever such a form of <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>icks, Politicks</hi> or <hi>Oeconomicks,</hi> as he hath delivered in the <hi>Deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi> and his own interpretation therof &amp;c:</p>
            <p>Horn. <hi>The Arts &amp; Sciences are of a diverse nature from the Gospel: that being a revelation of Redemption, and way to Salvation for fallen man; Philosophy but a purblind speculation about the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the creatures, and of God as he stands in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a Creatour &amp; governour of them, &amp;c:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. Not only Arts &amp; Sciences, but the Law, both <hi>Ceremonial, and Moral, &amp; Judicial</hi> are of diverse nature from the Gospel, as it is the revelation of Redemption &amp;c, Is all therefore superfluous &amp;c: 2. Whatsoever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in holy Scripture, tends some way or other to the way of salvation for falnman, and to make <hi>the man of God perfect,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim:</hi> 3. 16, 17. So doth the knowledg of Gods works, which are <hi>sought out of all them that have pleasure therin Psal.</hi> 111. 2. yea they all make for <hi>the glory of God</hi> Psal. 145. 10 and the knowledg of Gods works is laid down in holy writt, not in a purblind speculation about the creatures, but in a way infallible.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though the Gospel in a strict sense, signifies the glad tidings of Redemption by Jesus Christ;
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:000040_0054_0F9F1839A1136070"/>
yet it hath a larger signification sometimes, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 16. wherin the Apostle tells us of the <hi>day of Judgment, in which God shall judg the secrets of men according to the Gospel:</hi> there the rule of the last judgment shall be not only the Gospel in a strict sense, but as the Law may be also comprehended under it: and whatsoever is contained in the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the works of God, and as farr as it concerns a minister to preach all profitable and Scripture trueths, the knowledg of Arts &amp; Sciences is usefull and expedient to him to hold them forth to his hearers.</p>
            <p>Horn. <hi>The Law, or doctrine of the Lord is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, for conversion &amp; edification</hi> Psal. 19. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> But this perfect doctrine, comprehends the doctrine of Gods works, which is called <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy.</hi> Besides that perfection doth not exclude, but presuppose that same <hi>to gnoston tou theou, Rom:</hi> 1. 19. some common notions concerning God &amp; his works are left in every man still, that must not be extinguished.</p>
            <p>Horn. <hi>If the said heathenish sciences are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to salvation, then we are not compleat in Christ but the contrary is affirmed</hi> Col. 2. 2, 3, 10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> Heathenish sciences are not necessary to salvation, nor simply to make an able minister: a christian may be compleat in Christ, &amp; a minister, an able minister without them, as the Apostles and many others have been. We graunt that all the
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:000040_0055_0F9F183A4E52DAD8"/>
treasures of soul-saving knowledg are in Christ, yet this doth not exclude the expedience of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Law ceremoniall or morall (which are metinoned in the same place <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 14.) though we may be compleat in Christ without seeking our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by them.</p>
            <p>Horn. <hi>If we are to beware of Philosophy least we be spoyled by it, then it is not necessary to teach &amp; preserve us: but the former is true</hi> Col: 2. 8. <hi>and by Philosophy the Apostle means not only Sophistry, but that which the wisest Philosophers accounted Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. No Christian (that I know of) will say that heathenish Philosophy is necessary to teach or preserve him or others. 2. What Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy means, he explains, and addeth to Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, vain deceit, &amp; that is no better then sophistry.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There are many false principles of heathenish Philosophy, as the eternity of the world, the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the will to goodness, the placing of the chiefest good in contemplation, or in moral vertues such notions as these will spoil us, and must bee shunned. But there are many true principles, even amongst the heathens, (which the Apostle calleth, <hi>that which is known of God, as his eternal power and Godhead,</hi>) these will not spoil us.</p>
            <p n="4">4, There is nothing so good, no not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures themselves, but they may be abused, and it is good counsel to warn men to take heed that they
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:000040_0056_0F9F183B18C2F958"/>
bee not spoyled by the Scriptures abused: much more may we be warned that we be not spoiled by the Philosophy of the heathens.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The word (spoiled) by an allegory, hath respect to what he spake before, about the treasures of Christ or the word, <hi>verse</hi> 2. that which robbeth us of these treasures, leaves us but poor creatures, but all Philosophicall tenents do not this.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I deny not but that (as Ames saith, and it is alledged by <hi>Mr. Crandon</hi>) the School-men &amp; Popish writers have made a very hodch-potch &amp; mingle-mangle of heathenish Philosophy and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity together, and so brought in many pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous errours into Divinity, and it is likely that the Apostle in this place forewarnes the faithfull to beware of such Philosophy, which is called <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. <hi>the depths of Satan,</hi> But what is this to the forbidding of sober &amp; Christian Philosophy?
