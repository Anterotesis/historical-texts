            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>DEAR FRIENDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT hath frequently been the Concern
of our <hi>Yearly Meeting,</hi> to testify
their Uneasiness and Disunity, with
the Importation and Purchasing
of <hi>Negrocs</hi> and other <hi>Slaves,</hi> and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
the Overseers of the several <hi>Meetings</hi>
to <hi>advise</hi> and <hi>deal</hi> with such as engage
therein. And it hath likewise been the
continued Care of many weighty <hi>Friends,</hi>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:007201_0003_0F687441B7EB4EC0"/>
to press those that bear our Name, to
guard, as much as possible, against, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in any Respect, concerned in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
the Bondage of such unhappy
People: Yet, as we have with Sorrow
to observe, that their Number is of late
increased amongst us; we have thought
proper to make our Advice and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
more public, that none may plead
Ignorance of our Principles therein; and
also, again, earnestly to exhort all to
avoid, in any Manner encouraging that
Practice of making <hi>Slaves</hi> of our Fellow
Creatures.</p>
            <p>Now dear <hi>Friends,</hi> if we continually
bear in Mind the royal Law, <hi>of doing to
others, as we would be done by,</hi> we shall
never think of bereaving our Fellow
Creatures of that valuable Blessing Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty;
nor endure to grow rich by their
Bondage. To live in Ease and Plenty,
by the Toil of those whom Violence and
Cruelty have put in our Power, is neither
consistent with Christianity, nor common
Justice; and we have good Reason to
believe, draws down the Displeasure of
Heaven, it being a melancholy but true
Reflection, That, where <hi>Slave</hi> keeping
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:007201_0004_0F68744289EC11D0"/>
prevails, pure Religion and Sobriety
decline, as it evidently tends to harden
the Heart, and render the Soul less sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
of that holy Spirit of Love,
Meekness and Charity, which is the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Character of a true Christian.</p>
            <p>How then can we who have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
to publish the Gospel of universal
Love and Peace among Mankind, be so
inconsistent with ourselves, as to purchase
such who are Prisoners of War; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
encourage, this antichristian Practice?
And more especially, as many of these
poor Creatures are stolen away, Parents
from Children, and Children from Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
and others who were in good Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
in their native Country, inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly
torn from what they esteemed a
happy Situation, and compelled to toil
in a State of Slavery, too often extreamly
cruel! What dreadful Scenes of Murther
and Cruelty those barbarous Ravages
must occasion in these unhappy People's
Country, are too obvious to mention: Let
us make their Case our own, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what we should think, and how we
should feel, were we in their Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.
Remember our blessed Redeemer's
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007201_0005_0F68744327FFC6D0"/>
positive Command, <hi>To do unto others, as
we would have them do unto us,</hi> and that,
<hi>with what Measure we mete, it shall be mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured
to us again.</hi> And we intreat you to
examine, whether the purchasing of a
<hi>Negroe</hi> either born here, or imported,
doth not contribute to a further Importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and consequently to the upholding
all the Evils above mentioned, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
Man-stealing, the only Theft
which by the <hi>Mosaic</hi> Law was punished
with Death, <hi>He that stealeth a Man and sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth
him, or if he be found in his Hand, he
shall surely be put to death,</hi> Exod. xxi. 16.</p>
            <p>THE Characteristic and Badge of a true
Christian is Love, and good Works; our
SAVIOUR'S whole Life on Earth was one
continual Exercise of them: <hi>Love one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,</hi>
says he, <hi>as I have loved you.</hi> How
can we be said to love our Brethren, who
bring, or for selfish Ends keep them in
Bondage? Do we act consistent with
this noble Principle, who lay such heavy
Burdens on our Fellow Creatures? Do
we consider, that they are called, and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
desire that they may become Heirs
with us in Glory, and rejoice in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of the Sons of GOD, whilst we are
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007201_0006_0F687443D8397638"/>
with-holding from them the common
Liberties of Mankind? Or can the Spirit
of GOD, by which we have always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed
to be led, be the Author of those
oppressive and unrighteous Measures?
Or do we not thereby manifest, that tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Interest hath more Influence on our
Conduct herein, than the Dictates of that
merciful, holy and unerring GUIDE?</p>
            <p>AND we likewise earnestly recommend
to all who have <hi>Slaves,</hi> to be careful
to come up in the Performance of their
Duty towards them, and to be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
watchful over their own Hearts; it
being, by sorrowful Experience remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
that Custom and a Familiarity with
Evil of any Kind, hath a Tendency to
byass the Judgment, and deprave the
Mind. And it's obvious, that the future
Welfare of those poor <hi>Slaves,</hi> who are
now in Bondage, is generally too much
disregarded by those who keep them;
if their daily Task of Labour be but ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled,
little else perhaps is thought of;
nay, even that which in others would be
looked upon with Horror and Detestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
is little regarded in them by their
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007201_0007_0F687444A621E2F8"/>
Masters, such as the frequent Separation
of Husbands from Wives, and Wives
from Husbands, whereby they are tempted
to break their Marriage Covenants, and live
in Adultery, in direct Opposition to the
Laws both of GOD and Men, although
we believe, that CHRIST died for all
Men, without respect of Persons. How
fearful then ought we to be, of engaging
in what hath so natural a Tendency to
lessen our Humanity, and of suffering
ourselves to be enured to the Exercise of
hard and cruel Measures, lest thereby we
in any Degree, loose our tender and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Sense of the Miseries of our Fellow
Creatures, and become worse than those
who have not believ'd?</p>
            <p>AND, dear <hi>Friends,</hi> you who by Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
have <hi>Slaves</hi> born in your Families,
we beseech you to consider them as Souls
committed to your Trust, whom the
LORD will requite at your Hand, and
who as well as you are made Partakers of
the Spirit of Grace, and called to be
Heirs of Salvation, and let it be your
constant Care, to watch over them for
Good, instructing them in the Fear of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007201_0008_0F68744563C983A8"/>
GOD, and the Knowledge of the Gospel
of CHRIST, that they may answer the
End of their Creation, and GOD be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified
and honoured by them, as well as
by us, and so train them up, that if you
should come to behold their unhappy Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation,
in the same Light that many
worthy Men who are at rest have done,
and many of your Brethren now do; and
should think it your Duty to set them free,
they may be the more capable to make a
proper use of their Liberty. Finally
Brethren, we intreat you, in the Bowels
of Gospel Love, seriously to weigh the
Cause of detaining them in Bondage: If
it be for your own private Gain, or any
other Motive than their Good, it's much
to be feared, that the Love of GOD, and
the Influence of the holy Spririt, is not
the prevailing Principle in you, and that
your Hearts are not sufficiently redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the World, which that you,
with ourselves may more and more come
to witness, through the cleansing Virtue
of the holy Spirit of JESUS CHRIST, is
our earnest Desire. With the Salutation
