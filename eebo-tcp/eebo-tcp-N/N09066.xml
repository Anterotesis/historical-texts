            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T has been a common Remark among thoſe who have obſerved upon the capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Diſpenſations of Fortune, that great Events are often produced by Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that are not ſeemingly adequate; nay, that the ſame apparent Cauſes have quite contrary Effects, and the Road that leads one Man to Wealth, Honour, and Power, ſometimes carries another to Poverty, Infamy, and Ruin. Hence comes that confuſed Diſtribution of Axes and Coronets, Halters and Ribbons; which Hiſtory diſplays by nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous ſhocking Examples, and thus it is, that Fate ſeems to play at Croſs-Purpoſes with Mankind; or to ſpeak in Scripture Phraſe, in this Senſe as well as many others, <hi>the Wiſdom of this World is Fooliſhneſs.</hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> by reading the Tryal of <hi>John Peter Zen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi> at <hi>New-York,</hi> upon <hi>an Information for printing and publiſhing a Libel.</hi> This Piece, it ſeems, has been lately printed there, and was put into my Hands t'other Day, by a Friend who has both a general Acquaintance and a Correſpondence with the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Colonies, as a rare Production, containing many Things new and ſurpriſing. And in Truth, I muſt ſay it affords a lively Specimen, in Miniature, of the Juſtneſs of the foregoing Remarks; I mean that Part of it which is attributed to <hi>Andrew Hamilton,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of <hi>Philadelphia, Barriſter at Law;</hi> together with the Sequal, deſcribing the munificent Behaviour of the Citizens in Common Council aſſembled, to the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gentleman, for his ſingular Performance on that Occaſion.</p>
               <p>I muſt at the ſame Time aſſure you, that if <hi>Zenger</hi>'s Tryal had been printed by Order of the Court that tried him, or from a Copy taken by a private Hand
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:011573_0003_0F8746FB04627F60"/>
at the Tryal, or by any other Means that excluded Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Approbation or Privity, I ſhould have enjoy'd my own Opinion, without troubling you or any Body elſe about it, and had the Charity to reſolve all the Extravagancies that occur throughout his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, into a right Diſcernment of the People he talk'd to, and a Dexterity in captivating them, which had its Effect in the Acquittal of his Client. But when a Gentleman of the Bar takes the Pains to write over a long Diſcourſe (he being the only Lawyer of either Side who gave the Printer his Notes) in order to ſend it abroad through the World, as a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen of his Abilities, Sentiments, and Principles; as a ſolemn Argument in the Law, fit to ſee the light and abide the Teſt in all Places, and above all, <hi>as a Taſk of Duty,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Zeng. <hi>Tryal,</hi> P. 39. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>which he thought himſelf bound to perform, even by going to the utmoſt Parts of the Land</hi> for the Purpoſe; and all this, <hi>without Fee or Reward, under the Weight of many Years and great Infirmities of Body:</hi> When a Barriſter, I ſay, thus becomes a Volunteer for Error, and preſumes to obtrude bad Law and falſe Reaſoning upon the Senſe of Mankind, becauſe the ſage Magiſtrates of <hi>New-York</hi> have put their Seal to it; I think myſelf at Liberty, without uſing any other Apology, to exerciſe the judging Privilege of a Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſince the Gentleman himſelf has put me into the Poſſeſſion of it.</p>
               <p>In doing this, I ſhall not in the leaſt gratifie a vain Itch of Writing, for there are no extraordinary Talents neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for refuting groſs Abſurdities; but I ſhall have the honeſt Merit of endeavouring to undeceive ſuch of my Fellow Subjects in the Plantations as may; from the late uncommon Succeſs of the Doctrine, miſtake the Liberty of the Preſs for a Licence to write and publiſh infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Things of their Superiors, and of all others, at their Pleaſure, provided they write and publiſh nothing but what is true. In the next Place, I would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, as far as I am able, the Dignity of the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Law in theſe remote Parts of the Britiſh

Dominions; and prevent its learned Profeſſors in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> who probably will ſee the renowned Piece above mentioned (if we may judge from the Induſtry uſed in diſperſing it) from ſuſpecting that all their <hi>American</hi> Brethren uſe the like Arts to gain Popularity and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Rewards. The former, having the Advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of going daily to the great School of Law at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> are already apt enough to think meanly of the Accompliſhment of the latter, who are far removed from Inſtruction; and their Opinion muſt be ſtrongly confirmed in this Reſpect, if ſuch a Rhapſody as was utter'd at <hi>New-York,</hi> ſhould not only be applauded and rewarded publickly there, but printed and ſcatter'd in Reams through the other Colonies, without being followed by a ſuitable Animadverſion.</p>
               <p>Neither will it he amiſs to take ſome Notice in this Place of the Quackery of the Profeſſion in general, without any particular Application, as it has been practiſed with vaſt Succeſs in ſome of our Colonies. You will often ſee (if common Fame may be truſted) a ſelf-ſufficient enterpriſing Lawyer, compounded of ſomething between a Politician and a Broker, who making the Foibles of the Inhabitants his Capital Study, and withal taking Advantage of the Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Judges, the Ignorance of ſome of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the Modeſty of others, and the honeſt Scruples of a third Sort (without having any of his own) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes inſenſibly an Oracle in the Courts, and acquires by Degrees a kind of Dominion over the Minds as well as the Eſtates of the People. An Influence never to be obtained but by the help of Qualities very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from Learning and Integrity. Where ever ſuch a Man is found, the Wonder is not great, if from a long Habit of advancing what he pleaſes, and having it received for Law, he comes in Time to fancy, that what he pleaſes to advance is really Law.</p>
               <p>Give me Leave, therefore, to beſpeak two or three of your Papers, during this ſhort Vacation between our Monthly Courts, that I may candidly examine this now Syſtem of <hi>Libels</hi> lately compoſed and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated

               <p>IN conſidering the Defence made for the Defendant (Mr. <hi>Zenger,</hi> by his Council Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi>) upon <hi>not guilty</hi> pleaded to an <hi>Information for printing and publiſhing a Libel,</hi> it is not to the Purpoſe to enquire how far the Matters charged in the Information are in their Nature Libellous, nor whether the <hi>Innuendos</hi> are
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011573_0005_0F8746FBDAFF1260"/>
properly uſed to apply the Matters to Perſons, Things, and Places. It is only neceſſary to examine the Truth of this ſingle Propoſition, upon which the whole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is grounded, and to which the ſeveral Parts of it refer; namely, <hi>that the ſeveral Matters charged in the Information, are not and cannot be libellous becauſe they are true in Fact.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Cardinal Point, upon which the learned Gentleman's whole Argument turns,<note place="margin">Zeng. Tryal. P. 17, 18, 30.</note> and which he lays down over and over, as the firſt Principle that governs the Doctrine of Libels; and accordingly he confeſſes the Printing and Publiſhing of the Papers laid in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and puts it upon the King's Council to prove the Facts contain'd in them to be falſe; alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſame Time, that unleſs that were done, the Defendant could not be guilty; but if the ſame were prov'd to he falſe,<note place="margin">P. 21. 22.</note> he would own the Papers containing them to be Libels. To this, it ſeems, the Attorney General, anſwer'd, <hi>that a Negative is not to be proved;</hi> and the latter replied in theſe Words, which I chooſe to ſet down that I may not be thought to do him wrong.<note place="margin">P. 22.</note>—<hi>I did expect to hear that a Negative cannot be proved; but every Body knows there are many Exceptions in that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rule: For if a Man is charged with killing another, or ſtealing his Neighbour's Horſe; if he is innocent in the one Caſe, he may prove the Man ſaid to be killed to be ſtill alive; and the Horſe ſaid to be ſtolen, never to have been out of his Maſter's Stable, &amp;c. And this I think is proving a Negative.</hi> Now I muſt think, in my turn, that it is ſtrange a Gentleman of his Sagacity, who owns he was prepar'd for the Objection, could not yet hit upon ſome of thoſe many Exceptions which every Body knows. For he does no more than give two Inſtances of one Affirmative being deſtroy'd by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that infers a Negative of the firſt, at which Rate moſt Negatives may be proved, and then the old Rule may be diſcarded. Thus if it is ſhewn that a
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011573_0005_0F8746FBDAFF1260"/>
Man is alive, it follows clearly that he was not kill'd; and if a Horſe is proved to have been always in his Maſter's Stable (for this is what muſt be underſtood of his being never out of the Stable) it certainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that he could not be ſtolen. So that, according to this new Scheme of Proof, he who is accuſed of killing a Man, or ſtealing a Horſe, is to be put upon proving that he did not kill or ſteal; becauſe it is poſſible that ſuch Proof may be had ſometimes: And ſo in the principal Caſe, if a Queſtion ariſes whether a certain Magiſtrate has done particular Acts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice or not, the Method is to ſhew that he did not do ſuch Acts, not that he did them. I have touch'd upon this, not for its Importance, but as a Specimen of the learned Barriſter's Manner of reaſoning, and of the Spirit with which he ſets out from the beginning.</p>
               <p>At length, however, he takes the <hi>Onus probandi</hi> upon himſelf, and rather than the Thing ſhould go unproved, generouſly undertakes,<note place="margin">P. 24.</note> at his Client's Peril, to prove the Matters charged in the Information as libellous, to be true. But I would be glad to know, by the Way, how this undertaking Gentleman could have proved the Truth of diverſe Facts contained in the Paper which the Defendant publiſhed, ſuppoſing the Court had been ſo much over ſeen as to let him into a Proof of this Sort. Could he prove, for Example, that <hi>Judges</hi> were arbitrarily diſplaced and new <hi>Courts</hi> erected, in the Province of <hi>New-York,</hi> without Conſent of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature? For I am credibly inform'd, there never was a Pretence or Surmiſe of more than <hi>One Judge</hi> being diſplaced, or more than <hi>One Court</hi> erected under Mr. <hi>Coſby</hi>'s Adminiſtration, both which happen'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one and the ſame Occaſion. Now I would not have this eſteem'd a captious Exception, when I have to deal with a Man of Law, who muſt or ought to know, that if ſuch a Juſtification as he offer'd were at all al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable, it ought to be full and expreſs, ſo as to leave no Room for a Libeller to multiply and exaggerate Facts, at his Pleaſure, when he is diſpoſed to traduce
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011573_0006_0F8746FD38553BF0"/>
Perſons in Authority; there being a manifeſt difference between a ſingle Act of Power without or againſt Law (from which perhaps few Governments have been free) and an habitual Abuſe of Power in repeated In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the ſame Species. I would further aſk, how he could prove <hi>that the Law itſelf was at an End, and that Tryals by Juries were taken away when a Governor pleaſed;</hi> for if I miſtake not, he was, at that Time ſpeaking to a Jury in a regular Court of Law, and in a Proſecution which the Governor had much at Heart (as the Gentleman himſelf inſinuates) and would have been highly pleaſed to convict his Client, yet would not attempt it but in the ordinary Courſe of Tryal by a Jury, and then too could not find a Jury that would convict him. I think I am warranted in putting theſe Queſtions, even by the Authority of the Barriſter himſelf,<note place="margin">P. 30, 31.</note> who ſays—<hi>Truth ought to govern the whole Affair of Libels, and yet the Party accuſed runs Riſque enough, even then; for if he fail of proving every Tittle he has wrote, and to the Satisfaction of the Court and Jury too, he may find to his Coſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But for the preſent, I will ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> was able to prove all theſe Things; nay that the Jury knew them all to be true. I will go further and allow, that Juries in criminal Caſes may determine both Law and Fact, when they are complicated, if they will take ſuch a Deciſion upon their Conſciences (which is almoſt the only Point in which I can have the Honour of agreeing with him) yet after all theſe Conceſſions, the main Queſtion reſts ſtill between us, viz. <hi>Whether a Writing can be a Libel, in legal Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, if the Matter contained in it be true.</hi> He is pleaſed indeed, to expreſs his Diſlike of infamous Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, even when they are true, if levell'd againſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Vices and Faults; and in this Caſe he calls them <hi>baſe,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 27. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>unworthy, ſcandalous, unmanly and unmannerly.</hi> But ſurely it might be expected, when a Point of Law was in Queſtion, that he would have told us whether they
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011573_0006_0F8746FD38553BF0"/>
were lawful or unlawful, innocent or criminal, ſince theſe laſt are the only Epithets that were relative to his Subject, tho' the firſt might have their Weight in a Sermon or moral Eſſay. But it is plain, he was aware of the Conſequence of being explicit upon this Head: for had he own'd ſuch Writings to be lawful becauſe true, he would have alarmed the common Senſe of Mankind, by opening a Door for expoſing at Mercy, the Frailties, Vices, Defects and Misfortunes of every Perſon high and low, which muſt inevitably deſtroy the Peace of Families, and beget ill Blood and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders. If on the other Hand, he had acknowledg'd ſuch Writings to be unlawful inaſmuch as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned private Miſcarriages and Tranſactions; but that every Man might write as much Truth as he pleaſed about the Adminiſtration of the Government, not only by pointing out Faults and Miſtakes, but by publiſhing his own Comment and Inferrences in order to fill the Minds of the People with all the Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies and Apprehenſions his Imagination can form; it muſt have ſhock'd Men of Underſtanding to be thus told, that the Law had provided againſt private Quarrels and Breaches of the Peace occaſion'd by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent Writing, but had taken no Care to prevent Sedition and publick Diſturbances ariſing from the ſame Cauſe.</p>
               <p>His favourite Poſition, however, was to be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd at all Events; and therefore when <hi>the Chief Juſtice</hi> rightly inſtructed him,<note place="margin">P. 22.</note> that he could not be admitted to give the Truth of a Libel in Evidence, <hi>that the Law was clear that he could not juſtify a Libel; for it is never the leſs a Libel tho' it is true;</hi> the diſcerning Gentleman was pleas'd to underſtand by the word <hi>juſtify, a Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by Plea, as it is in the Caſe of an Indictment for Murder, or an Aſſault and Battery; there</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the Priſoner cannot juſtify but plead not guilty: yet in Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he may prove it was in Defence of his Life, his Houſe, &amp;c. and in Aſſault and Battery, he may give in

Evidence that the other Party ſtruck firſt, and in both theſe Caſes he will be acquitted.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Party in either Caſe is acquitted, the Reaſon is I preſume, becauſe the Matter given in Evidence amounts to a Juſtification in Law of the Fact charged on him, and is equivalent to a Confeſſion and Avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in pleading. In like Manner, if Truth be a ſufficient Juſtification of a Libel, the Defendant will be acquitted upon proving the Contents of his Paper to be true.<note place="margin">P. 25.</note> Now let it be obſerved, that the Words of the Book which the Chief Juſtice relied on are theſe—<hi>It is far from being a Juſtification of a Libel, that the Contents thereof are true, ſince the greater Appearance there is of Truth in any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Invective, ſo much the more provoking it is.</hi> That this is good Law, I hope I ſhall be able to ſhew fully hereafter, as I ſhall ſhew, in the mean Time, that it is an expreſs Authority againſt the well-read Barriſter,<note place="margin">P. 22.</note> who declares, <hi>he has not in all his reading met with an Authority that ſays, he cannot be admitted to give the Truth in Evidence, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſeems to take it for granted (and I ſhall not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute it with him now) that Matter of Juſtification cannot, in any Caſe, be pleaded ſpecially to an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment of <hi>Aſſault or Murder;</hi> but the Party is to take Advantage of it in Evidence upon <hi>not Guilty</hi> pleaded. Let it be ſo; yet ſtill this Matter muſt be a ſufficient Juſtification, or the Party can have no Benefit from it any way: In an Action of Aſſault and Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, where the <hi>firſt Aſſault</hi> muſt be pleaded ſpecially; the Matter of Juſtification is juſt the ſame, as in an Indictment for the ſame Offence, where it muſt be given in Evidence upon the General Iſſue. I aſk them, whether the <hi>firſt Aſſault</hi> is a Juſtification in an Indictment of Aſſault and Battery; If the Barriſter ſhould anſwer negatively, ſuch Anſwer is againſt all Senſe, for the Party, is acquainted by Virtue of the Juſtification only. If he ſhould anſwer Affirmatively, he is inconſiſtent with himſelf, for he has but juſt Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd

that when the Book ſays, <hi>Truth is no Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> it muſt be underſtood of a Juſtification by Plea, by which he muſt mean that nothing elſe is a Juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but what is pleaded, or he muſt mean nothing at all. For the Words of the Book are—<hi>it is far from being a Juſtification,</hi> &amp;c. it is not ſaid—<hi>you are far from being at Liberty to plead it in Bar.</hi> In Truth, the Author is not there ſpeaking of the Forms and Rules of Proceedings upon Libels,<note place="margin">1 Hawk. Ch. 73. S. 5. 6. 7.</note> but upon the Subſtance and the Nature of the Crime, what ſhall and what ſhall not excuſe or juſtifie it. This is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt from the Reaſon ſubjoined to ſupport his Aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, viz. <hi>Since the greater Appearance there is of Truth, &amp;c.</hi> which is a ſolid Reaſon grounded on the Wiſdom of the Law, which puniſhes Libels, even againſt private Perſons, as Publick Offences, becauſe they provoke Men to Acts of Revenge and Breaches of the Peace. I hope it will not be ſaid, a Libel is leſs provoking, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Truth of it is to be given in Evidence than if it was to be pleaded in Bar.</p>
               <p>But all this is <hi>Star-chamber-Doctrine,</hi> with the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſter, and the very Mention of that Court ſerves him for an Anſwer to every Thing, for which he has no other Anſwer; becauſe the Memory of that Tribunal is juſtly deteſted on account of many illegal and exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Proceedings. No, this is the Authority of Mr. <hi>Serjeant Hawkings</hi> (tho' he uſes Marginal References to ſome Star-Chamber-caſes) whoſe Name is too great to receive any Addition from this Paper, and who after a long and ſtudious Search in the Crown-Law, laid down this Propoſition for Law at the Time he wrote his Book; and I believe it will appear, in the Sequel that he was not miſtaken. And now I come to join Iſſue with the Barriſter upon this Point, whether Mr. <hi>Serjeant</hi> or he is in the right; or in other Words whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Falſity in Fact be eſſential to a Libel, ſo that the Truth of the Fact may be given in Evidence to prove.<note place="margin">P. 28.</note> Writing to be no Libel.</p>

               <p>THE Authorities cited by Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> to ſupport the Propoſition formerly ſtated, conſiſt princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally of four Caſes, which I ſhall conſider in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as they were produced.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the Caſe of <hi>John de Northampton,</hi> 18 Ed. III.<note place="margin">Zeng. Tryal, P. 23.</note> 3 Inſt. 174. which he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves does not appear to have been a Caſe upon an Information, but that <hi>he has good Grounds to ſay it was upon an Indictment.</hi> This is what I ſhall not conteſt with him, becauſe it is not material, or indeed eaſy to be determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, without ſeeing the Record; tho' I conceive there are Grounds to ſay it was not upon an Indictment, as was the Caſe of <hi>Adam de Ravenſworth,</hi> mention'd by <hi>Lord Coke</hi> in the ſame Chapter. The Caſe, however, ſtands thus; <q>
                     <hi>John de Northampton,</hi> an Attorney of the King's Bench wrote a Letter to one <hi>Ferrers,</hi> one of the King's Council, that neither Sir <hi>William Scot,</hi> Chief Juſtice, nor his Fellows the King's Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, nor their Clerks, any great Thing would do by the Commandment of our Lord the King, &amp;c. which ſaid <hi>John</hi> being called, confeſs'd the Letter, &amp;c. <hi>Et quia praedictus Johannes cognovit dictam literam per ſe ſcriptam, Roberto de Ferrers, qui eſt de concilio Regis, quae litero continet in ſe nullam veritatem: Proetextu cujus Dom.

&amp;c.</q> Here ſays the Barriſter, <hi>by this Judgment it appears the libellous Words were utterly falſe, and there the Falſhood was the Crime, and is the Ground of the Judgment.</hi> For my own Part, I can neither ſee <hi>Truth nor Falſhood</hi> in the Words at the Time they were wrote, for they refer to a future Contingency that might or might not be as he ſaid; and in this Reſpect, they were the ſame as if the Man had ſaid, the Roof of Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-hall would fall upon Sir <hi>William Scot,</hi> and his Fellows. Beſides, the Words taken by themſelves have no ill Meaning; for I imagine it will be allowed that moſt of <hi>the great Things</hi> which Judges do, as Jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, are ſuch as ought neither to be done nor left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done by the King's Commandment. Where then was the Offence? The Record, I think, ſhews that in the following Words; <hi>proetextu cujus Dom. Rex ergo Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am &amp; Juſtic. ſuos habere poſſet indignationem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Idoe dictus Johannes committitur,</hi> &amp;c. It is obſerveable, that the Author of this Letter was an Attorney of the Court, and by the Contents thereof he preſumes to undertake for the Behaviour of the Judges in ſome great Matters that concerned their Office. The Letter was addreſs'd to a Perſon who was of the King's Council and might poſſibly communicate the Contents of ſuch a Letter to the King; the Conſequence of which might naturally be that; <hi>Dom. Rex habere poſſet indignationem ergo Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam,</hi> &amp;c. for great Things were ſome Times done, in thoſe Days, by the Kings Commandment, and the Judges, beſides, held their Poſts at Will and Pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The Words, <hi>quoe litera continet in ſe nullam veritatem,</hi> were therefore proper for the Judges to inſert, in Order to acquit themſelves to the King; but they are no more the Ground of the Judgment than theſe other Words; <hi>qui eſt de Concilio Regis,</hi> both being only incidental Clauſes that come in by way of Diſcription: For it is not ſaid; <hi>quia litera praedicta continet in ſe nullam veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem.</hi> After all, I would not have this Conſtruction of the Caſe, plain and natural as it is, paſs meerly upon my own Credit; for I ſhall ſhew that this Caſe was ſo underſtood by one of the greateſt Lawyers of his

III. a Letter was ſent to <hi>Ferrers,</hi> one of the King's Council, the Effect of which was, that <hi>Scot,</hi> Chief Juſtice, and his Companions of the ſame Bench, would not do a vain Thing at the Command of the King; <hi>yet becauſe he ſent ſuch a Letter to the King's Council, altho' he ſpake no Ill, yet becauſe it might incenſe the King againſt the Judges, he was puniſhed.</hi> If no Ill was ſaid, will it be pretended that the Falſhood of what was ſaid could be a Reaſon for puniſhing a Man? Is it not ridiculous to ſay that the Falſhood of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent or inſignificant Words can be Criminal? This Book therefore follows the Record of <hi>Northampton</hi>'s Caſe, and ſays; becauſe it might incenſe the King againſt the Judges, he was puniſh'd; which is almoſt a Tranſlation of <hi>praetextu cujus,</hi> &amp;c. which was the Ground of the Judgment, <hi>Idio Committitur.</hi>

               <p>The next Caſe which the Barriſter called to his Aid, is that of <hi>the Seven</hi> Biſhops; <hi>State Tryals,</hi> vol. 4. and here he relies on a Flouriſh of one of the Council for the Biſhops, and a dubious Expreſſion of one of the Judges, ſeparated from the Reſt of his Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Robert Sawyer,</hi> 'tis true, ſays <hi>both the Falſity of it</hi> (the Libel) <hi>and that it was malicious and ſeditious, are all Matters of Fact, which they</hi> (the King's Council) <hi>have offer'd to the Jury no Proof of,</hi> &amp;c. This I muſt confeſs, proves one Point to which the Barriſter adduced it,<note place="margin">P. 23.</note> viz. <hi>That he was not the firſt who inſiſted, that to make a Writing a Libel, it muſt be falſe.</hi> And when I have allow'd this, I may almoſt venture to ſay, it is the only Point he does prove from the Beginning to the Ending of his long elaborate Speech. Let me, however, oppoſe to this the Reply of Sir <hi>Thomas Powis,</hi> in theſe Words; <hi>whether a Libel be true or not, as to the Matter

of Fact; was it ever yet permitted in any Court of Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to be made a Queſtion; whether the Party be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhable for it? And therefore I wonder to hear theſe Gentlemen ſay, that becauſe it is not a falſe one, therefore it is not a Libel.</hi> Fol. 382.</p>
               <p>Mr. Juſtice <hi>Powel</hi> alſo does ſay; <hi>that to make it a Libel, it muſt be falſe; it muſt be malicious; and it muſt tend to Sedition.</hi> Upon which Words of this learned and worthy Judge, I would not preſume to offer any Comment, except that which other Words of his own afford, that plainly ſhew in what Senſe he then ſpoke. His ſubſequent Words are theſe: <hi>They</hi> (the Biſhops) <hi>tell his Majeſty it is not out of Averſeneſs to pay all due Obedience; nor want of Tenderneſs to their diſſenting Fellow Subjects; but becauſe they do conceive the Thing that was commanded them, was againſt the Law of the Land; they ſay, they apprehend the Declaration is illegal, becauſe it is founded on a diſpenſing Power. I do not remember in any Caſe in all our Law, that there is any ſuch Power in the King; and the Caſe muſt turn upon that. In ſhort, if there be no ſuch diſpenſing Power in the King, then that can be no Libel, which they preſented to the King, which ſays that the Declaration, being found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ſuch a pretended Power, is illegal.</hi> So that the Judge put the whole upon that ſingle Point, whether it be true that the King had ſuch a diſpenſing Power, or not; which is a Queſtion of Law, and not of Fact; and accordingly the Judge appeals to his own Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Law, not to Witneſſeſs or other Teſtimony, for a Deciſion of it. In Truth the Petition of the Biſhops is not capable of having Falſhood or Truth apply'd to it in any other Senſe, there being nothing elſe affirm'd or deny'd in it, <hi>but that they thought they could not do what was commanded them, becauſe it was againſt the Law.</hi> This was the Behaviour; theſe were the Sentiments of that upright Judge, that gain'd him ſo much Honour among all good Men, as the Barriſter takes Notice, not any Opinion of his, that the Contents of a Libel muſt be falſe in Fact, to make it a Libel;<note place="margin">P. 24.</note> as he would unfairly inſinuate.</p>

As it is in Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; we ſay always in the Indictment, he did it by the Inſtigation of the Devil: Can the Jury, if they find the Fact, find he did it not by ſuch Inſtigation? No, that does neceſſarily attend the very Nature of ſuch an Action or Thing. So in Informations for Offences of this Nature, we ſay, he did it falſely, maliciouſly, and ſeditiouſly, which are the formal Words; but if the Nature of the Thing be ſuch as neceſſarily imports Malice, Reproach, and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal to the Government, there needs no Proof but of the Fact done; the Law ſupplies the reſt. How ſhall any Man prove another Man's Malice, which is a Thing that lies only in a Man's Mind? How ſhould any Man know that I am malicious againſt the Government, but by my Actions?</q> Theſe Words, indeed, were pronounc'd by <hi>the Chief Juſtice Jefferies,</hi> who was then the Mouth of the Court; but tho' he was really an intemperate Judge (or a <hi>Monſter,</hi> as the Barriſter in <hi>his</hi> Bar-Language, delights to call him) yet I may ſafely refer it to all Men of Law, whether theſe Words could have diſcredited the beſt Mouth that ever ſpoke upon that Bench. State Tryals, Vol. 3. 939.</p>
               <p>An Inſtance of this Sort may not be impertinent, where a Chief Juſtice (who was no <hi>Monſter</hi>) addreſſes himſelf to a Jury, that was trying a Libel, in this Manner; <q>I will not repeat the Particulars to you,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011573_0010_0F8746FF9C316458"/>
only ſomething to what the Defendant has ſaid, that you may not be miſled. He ſays it does not appear that he did it maliciouſly or knowingly. There are ſome Things that you that are of the Jury are not to expect Evidence for, which it is impoſſible to know but by the Act itſelf; Malice is conceiv'd in the Heart; no Man knows it, unleſs he declares it. As in Murder, I have Malice to a Man; no Man knows it. I meet this Man and kill him; the Law calls this Malice. If a Man ſpeak ſcandalous Words againſt a Man in his Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Trade; he lays his Action, Malice; tho' he cannot prove it but by the Words themſelves; you may ſee, there is Malice ſuppoſed to a private Perſon in that Slander, much more to the King and the State.</q> State Tryals, Vol. 2. 537.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Tutchin's Caſe,</hi> the Barriſter does not properly cite, but endeavours to anſwer as a Caſe urged againſt him by the King's Council; and therefore I ſhall obſerve upon it in another Place.</p>
               <p>But the Caſe of Caſes is ſtill behind, which he reſerved for the laſt,<note place="margin">P. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>to make the Point clearer on his Side,</hi> than all the reſt put together could do. It is <hi>Fuller</hi>'s Caſe. State Tryals, Vol. 5. 441, 6, 7, 8; and it deſerves Notice, that altho' <hi>Fuller</hi> was charged with writing a Libel, yet <hi>that</hi> was not the Giſt of the Information. He was in Truth proſecuted for being <hi>a Cheat and Impoſter,</hi> by Order of the Houſe of Lords, as the King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil declare in the Opening.</p>
               <p>The Information accordingly ſets forth, <q>That <hi>W. F.</hi> intending the late <hi>King William</hi> and his Subjects to deceive; and to get ſeveral great Sums of Money fraudulently and deceitfully from the ſaid King; concerning a Correſpondency between di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Officers and Subjects of the ſaid late King, and <hi>the late King James</hi> falſely pretended to be had; did write and print a Libel, entitled, Original Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, &amp;c. with the Depoſition of <hi>T. J.</hi> and <hi>T. F.</hi> Eſqrs, proving the Corruption lately practiſed in
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011573_0011_0F87470078C81A30"/>
this Nation; and the ſaid <hi>W. F.</hi> afterwards did publiſh, utter, and for Truth affirm the ſaid ſeveral falſe and ſcandalous Libels, without any lawful Authority; <hi>whereas in Truth the ſaid T. J. did not depoſe upon his Oath, as is contained in the ſaid falſe and ſcandalous Libel; but the ſaid ſcandalous Libels are falſe, feigned, and altogether contrary to the Truth,</hi> &amp;c.</q> Here it is manifeſt he was accuſed of a Cheat, in forging <hi>the Correſpondence and the Depoſitions</hi> juſt mentioned, with a Deſign of getting Money by his pretended Diſcovery. And hence it comes, that the Judge very properly aſks him, <hi>have you any Witneſſes? If you take upon you to write ſuch Things as you are charged with, it lies upon you to prove them true, at your Peril. How came you to write thoſe Books that are not true? If you have any Witneſſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them. Thus ſaid, and thus did that great Man, Lord Chief Juſtice Holt;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 24.</note> but not upon a Tryal of the like Kind with Mr. <hi>Zen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi>'s, as his Council would have it thought. For in this Caſe the <hi>Cheat</hi> and the <hi>Impoſture</hi> was the Offence, which conſiſted wholly in the Falſity; that is, in affirming ſuch Things for <hi>Realities,</hi> when they were nought but <hi>Fictions.</hi> On the contrary, had he been able to prove thoſe <hi>Letters</hi> and thoſe <hi>Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions</hi> to be authentic, the Diſcovery would have been valuable, and might intitle him perhaps to Favour and Protection, inſtead of Puniſhment; however irregular he was in taking ſuch a Method to publiſh Matters of that high Conſequence. After this, let the learned Barriſter, <hi>in all his Reading,</hi> ſhew an Information or Indictment for a <hi>Libel,</hi> where the <hi>Falſity</hi> is aſſigned in Form with an <hi>ubi revera,</hi> as the Foundation of the Offence; which is done in <hi>Fuller</hi>'s Caſe; and then I will acknowledge that the Queſtions put here by <hi>Lord Holt,</hi> would have been proper upon the Tryal of his Client.</p>
               <p>This is the Sum of the Barriſter's Law-Caſes. And is it not high Time to aſk, whether ſuch groſs Miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of the Books can proceed from Ignorance
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011573_0011_0F87470078C81A30"/>
or Diſingenuity? Be that as it will; it might certainly be expected, that a Propoſition advanced with ſo much Aſſurance, <hi>by a Man of Years and Reading,</hi> ſhould have been ſupported by ſome One Authority in Point, rather than by a Series of low Prevarication and Quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Could he not find in all the Book-Caſes and Tryals at large concerning <hi>Libels</hi> (which are ſufficient of themſelves to make a large Volume) one example of Proof being received to the Truth or Falſity con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in a libelious Writing? Indeed there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it to be found; tho' the Occaſions have been many, where ſuch Proof might be had, if it were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; nay where the Truth of the Thing was notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to all Men, and yet no Queſtion ever moved con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it. This ſhall fully appear in the Sequel.</p>

               <p>16 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. The <hi>King,</hi> v <hi>Pym.</hi> 1 Sid. 219. B. R.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pym</hi> was indicted at <hi>Exeter,</hi> for a Libel, which he deliver'd to a Parſon to be publiſh'd in Church there, and was to this Effect; <q>You are deſired to bewail the Sodomitry, Wickedneſs, Whoredom, Lewdneſs, that is of late broken out in this formerly well-govern'd City, that God would turn their Hearts from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011573_0012_0F87470439AF5968"/>
thoſe Wickedneſſes which go unpuniſhed by the Magiſtrates.</q> 
                  <hi>Pym</hi> confeſs'd the Indictment, and was fined 100 <abbr>l.</abbr> He afterwards brought a Writ of Error, and aſſign'd for Error that this was no Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, becauſe tho' he ſays, <hi>go unpuniſhed by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,</hi> yet he does not ſay that the Magiſtrate knew of it; and Wickedneſs unknown cannot be puniſhed. It was anſwer'd by the Court, that this contains Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great Scandal to the Government of the City, for it makes the late Government better than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, &amp;c. <hi>Hide, Twiſden, Keiling, Windham,</hi> Juſt.</p>
               <p>I have pitch'd upon this Caſe, becauſe the Barriſter is fond of comparing the Plantations to large Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;<note place="margin">Zeng. Tryal. P. 20.</note> and he will find here that even thoſe are not left to the Mercy of Libellers, <hi>altho' they do not put in a Claim to the ſacred Rights of Majeſty:</hi> And that a Miſbehaviour of this Kind to the Magiſtrates of a Corporation,<note place="margin">P. 21.</note> is not entirely innocent, <hi>becauſe it is not to be judged of, or puniſhed, as a like Undutifulneſs would be to our Sovereign.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Caſe was adjudged about four Years after the <hi>Reſtoration,</hi> when the Memory of the preceeding Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation was freſh in every Body's Mind. It is ſtrange therefore Mr. <hi>Pym</hi> did not put himſelf on his Tryal at <hi>Exeter,</hi> for it is evident beyond Contradiction to the People of that Age, from their own Knowledge, as it is now to us from Hiſtory, that the Wickedneſs ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Libel was reſtrain'd by a ſtricter Hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, than after the Reſtoration. But this notorious Truth, it ſeems did not avail Mr. <hi>Pym.</hi> 22. <hi>Car.</hi> 2. the King. v. <hi>Saunders.</hi> Raym. 201. B. R.</p>
               <p>Information for writing a ſcandalous Libel to <hi>H. Rich.</hi> who was indebted to him, and kept him out of his Money three Years, by obtaining a Protection, and at length getting into the Priſon of the King's Bench. <hi>Saunders</hi> wrote him a Letter, wherein he tells him, <q>That if he had any Honeſty, Civility, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, or Humanity, he would not deal ſo by him;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011573_0012_0F87470439AF5968"/>
and that he would one Day be damned, and be in Hell for his Cheating;</q> and cited ſeveral Places of Scripture to make good his Allegations. The De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant was found <hi>Guilty,</hi> and moved in Arreſt of Judgment, that the Subſtance of the Letter is not ſcandalous but impertinent and inſignificant, &amp;c. <hi>Cur.</hi> The Letter is provocative, and tends to the incenſing Mr. <hi>Rich.</hi> to break the Peace. The Court adjudged the Letter ſcandalous, and fin'd him forty Marks. <hi>Keiling, Twiſden, Rainford, Moreton, Juſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would entreat the clear-ſighted Barriſter, to look carefully into the Words of this Libel, and try if he can diſcover any Truth or Falſhood in them that was capable of Proof; and I muſt remark upon both theſe Caſes, that tho' they were adjudged in the Reign of K. Charles II. yet neither of them was upon a State Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, or at a Time when the Spirit of <hi>Plots and Factions,</hi> had infeſted the Courts of Juſtice; but they remain unqueſtionable Authorities at this Day.</p>
               <p>State Tryal, Vol. 5. The Caſe of <hi>Tutchin</hi> is ſtrong againſt him; a Caſe adjudged ſince the Revolution, before that learn'd and upright Judge Sir <hi>John Holt;</hi> and plainly ſhews the Fallacy that runs throughout his whole Argument.</p>
               <p>The Points inſiſted on by this <hi>Chief Juſtice,</hi> in his Charge to the Jury, were theſe; <q>To ſay that cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Officers are appointed to adminiſter Affairs is certainly a Reflection on the Government If Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould not be called to an Account for poſſeſſing the People with an ill Opinion of the Government, no Government can ſubſiſt; now you are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether theſe Words I have read to you, do not tend to beget an ill Opinion of the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Government; to tell us that thoſe that are employ'd know nothing of the Matter, and thoſe that do know are not employ'd. Men are not adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Offices, but Offices to Men, out of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Regard to their Intereſt, and not to their Fitneſs for the Places. This is the Purport of theſe Papers.</q> If this was the Purport of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011573_0013_0F87470552B88E88"/>
and ſo criminal as hath been juſt ſaid; it is amazing, ſurely, that Mr. <hi>Tutchin</hi> did not offer to prove the Truth of theſe Allegations, and thereby take out their Sting. Could not he poſſibly think of as many corrupt or incompetent Officers, Eccleſiaſtical, Civil, or Military, in <hi>England,</hi> prefer'd by Intereſt rather than Merit, <hi>as there were Judges diſplaced and Courts erected in New-York?</hi> Or if he was reſtrain'd by the hard hearted Judge, from deſporting himſelf in this pleaſant and ſpacious Field, could he not apply to the private Knowledge which the Jurors (as well as the Reſt of Mankind) had of theſe Matters? For I imagine it will be allowed, that if no Inſtances of this Sort could be ſhewn at the Time of <hi>Tutchin</hi>'s Tryal, it was the only Period within the Memory of Man, or the reach of Hiſtory, that wanted the like.</p>
               <p>But the Misfortune was, the poor Man was not bleſs'd with ſuch ſkilful Council as is to be had in <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> to think of theſe good Things for him; otherwiſe you might have heard an alert Advocate <hi>(after returning Thanks to his Lordſhip for nothing)</hi> addreſs himſelf to the Jury in this or the like eloquent Strain;<note place="margin">P. 25.</note> 
                  <q>then, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the Jury it is to you we muſt appeal for Witneſſes to the Truth of the Facts we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd and are deny'd the Liberty to prove; the Law ſuppoſes you to be ſummon'd out of the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood where the Fact is alledged to be committed; and the Reaſon of your being taken out of the Neighbourhood is, becauſe you are ſuppos'd to have the beſt Knowledge of the Fact that is to be tried. And were you to find a Verdict againſt my Client, you muſt take upon you to ſay the Papers referr'd to in the Information, and which are proved to be written and publiſhed by us, are falſe, ſcandalous and ſeditious. You are Citizens of <hi>London,</hi> honeſt and lawful Men; and the Facts which we offer to prove were not committed in a Corner; they are notoriouſly known to be true. And as we are deny'd the Liberty of giving Evidence to prove the Truth
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011573_0013_0F87470552B88E88"/>
of what we have publiſhed, I will beg Leave to lay it down as a ſtanding Rule in ſuch Caſes, that the ſuppreſſing of Evidence ought always to be taken for the ſtrongeſt Evidence, and I hope, it will have that Weight with <hi>you.</hi> Lay your Hands upon your Hearts, Gentlemen, and recollect. Do none of you know; nay, do not all of you know certain Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who ſhall be nameleſs, that have been lately promoted by Favour and Intereſt, to Places of Truſt and Profit both in Church and State, Army and Navy; whom you muſt know and believe in your Conſciences to be ill Men, and no way quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for ſuch Preferment; as my ſagacious Client has moſt ſeaſonably remonſtrated to the Neighbours, by Virtue of that Right which every free born Subject hath of publiſhing his Complaints, when the Matters ſo publiſhed can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with Truth?<note place="margin">P. 17, 29.</note>
                  </q> But is <hi>Lord Holt</hi> aſleep all this Time; can any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Man, who has but common Notions of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, imagine that this great Judge would ſuffer ſuch Traſh as this to be thrown out in any Court where he ſat in Judgement? But what muſt he have ſaid if the Libeller before him had offer'd to prove, <q>that the Law itſelf was at an End; that Tryals by Juries were taken away when a Miniſter pleas'd; that no Man could call any Thing his own, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy any Liberty longer than thoſe in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration would condeſcend to let him do it?</q> Would he have ſaid that theſe Things did not tend to poſſeſs the People with an ill Opinion of the Government, and that Governments might well ſubſiſt, tho' Men ſhould not be called to an Account for publiſhing the like? Or would he have ſaid, it was no Matter what Opinion the People had of the Government, nor whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſubſiſted or not, provided theſe Aſſertions were true; and ſo have diſcharged the Man as a Publiſher of precious and uſeful Truths <hi>to put the Neighbours on their Guard?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:011573_0014_0F8747059A5F1170"/>But here alſo the Barriſter lays hold of a Random-Queſtion, put by one of the King's Council to Mr. <hi>Montague,</hi> who was for the Defendant and was then touching upon the Affairs of the Navy. Saith the former, <hi>will you ſay they are true?</hi> Now the latter had hinted as much as that theſe Things were true; but did it with that Caution which a Man of Skill uſes, when he would ſay ſomething in Support of a lame Cauſe, but don't care to preſs an Impropriety too far. For that learned Gentleman was very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that if he had preſum'd to inſiſt expreſly on the Truth of the Matters contain'd in his Clients Papers, a ſevere Reprimand was the beſt Thing that could have befallen him. His Words are theſe; <hi>no Body can ſay, that we never had any Miſmanagements in the Royal Navy; and whenever that has happen'd the Merchants of</hi> England <hi>in all probability have ſuffer'd for it.</hi> But does the Judge, in his Charge to the Jury, vouchſafe to give this Matter any Anſwer, or ſo much as to mention it? <hi>Lord Holt,</hi> did not uſually paſs by mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Things that were offer'd in Defence of Perſons tried before him; yet in this Caſe he makes no Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Scruple about the Truth or Falſhood of <hi>Tutchin</hi>'s Papers, altho they contain'd many Things which his Lordſhip, the Jury, and all the World knew to be ****. This candid Judge, however, puts the Merits of the whole upon the Scandal of the Government, and the evil Tendency of ſuch Writings. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt once more call upon the Northern Barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to ſhew a ſingle Inſtance where Witneſſes have been produced by Council, and admitted by the Court to prove the Truth of a Libel. When he does this, it will deſerve Conſideration; but till then he may talk by the Hour without any Meaning.</p>
               <p>I could mention ſome Caſes of a more modern Date, that have been adjudged in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> when this wild Doctrine was not ſo much as thought of, and when it would not have been altogether uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs had it been practicable; but I have choſe to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

ſuch only as are reported, that the Books may ſpeak for themſelves, and Judge between us.</p>
               <p>But this Lawyer ſeems to be above having his Points of Law decided by Authorities of the Law; and has ſomething in Reſerve, which may ſerve to overthrow not only what has been offer'd in this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but even all the Books of the Law. This is what he calls <hi>the Reaſon of the Thing,</hi> but is truly and properly a Sketch of his own <hi>Politicks;</hi> which leads me to ſhew that <hi>the true Reaſon of the Thing</hi> here, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with the <hi>Law,</hi> and conſequently both theſe are againſt this expert Maſter of Law and Reaſon.</p>

               <p>THE <hi>Reaſon of the Thing,</hi> as well as it can be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from a Heap of Particulars huddled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without Order and Method, may be reduced to the three following Heads.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Form of an Information for a Libel, and the Neceſſity of knowing the Truth or Falſhood of its Contents, in order to direct the Judges in award<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arbitrary Puniſhment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Right every Man hath of publiſhing his Complaints, when the Matters ſo publiſhed can be ſupported with Truth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Neceſſity there is of uſing this Right, in the Plantations eſpecially, by Reaſon of the Difficulty of obtaining Redreſs againſt evil Governors by any other Means.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It will not be improper to premiſe, under the firſt Head, that a Gentleman of the Law, who takes upon him to pronounce ſo magiſterially, as the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Barriſter has done concerning <hi>Libels,</hi> ought to have conſider'd well the Nature and Extent of his
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011573_0015_0F8747065BE81AA0"/>
Subject. It might be expected that he is not unknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in any Part of Learning neceſſary to fix his Idea of a <hi>Libel</hi> And yet the preſent Caſe would appear to be quite different. This learned Gentleman might have inform'd himſelf by reading ſome of the ancient Laws before the Conqueſt, that when the <hi>Falſity</hi> of virulent Writings and Speeches was taken into the Deſcription of the Crime, there was a ſpecifick Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty annex'd, viz. <hi>Cutting out the Offenders Tongue.

Suppoſe a Man brings an Action of <hi>Treſpaſs,</hi> for vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating his Wife, and he fairly ſets forth the Truth of the Caſe. <hi>viz.</hi> That the Defendant, <hi>by amorous Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, Letters, Preſents,</hi> &amp;c. did gain the Conſent of the Plaintiff's Wife, and at length debauched her, I would aſk, whether an Action of <hi>Treſpaſs</hi> thus laid can be ſupported? I fancy not; and yet this is a more juſt Account of the Matter, than when <hi>vi &amp; armis,</hi> viz. <hi>Swords, Staves, Knives,</hi> &amp;c. are introduced as Inſtruments of invading this tender Part of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Property. Suppoſe further, a Man kills another whom he never ſaw or heard of before; and he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of Murdering him <hi>of Malice fore thought.</hi> How come ſuch Words to be put into an Indictment for a Fact ſo circumſtanc'd? They muſt have ſome Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſurely they are not put there by Chance; and I am of Opinion the Indictment would not be good without them. Why, there is this ſhort Anſwer to be given to all theſe childiſh Queſtions. There are many Words uſed in Pleadings of moſt kinds, ſometimes for Aggravation, ſometimes for Comprehenſion, often in Compliance with ancient Uſage, which are not tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſable, and many Times are incapable of Proof. The Form of Indictments and Informations follows the Nature of the Fact, and ſets it out in its worſt Dreſs; and if the Fact is made appear to be unlawful, all the hard Names are ſupply'd by Implication of Law. This is not all,<note place="margin">P. 23.</note> quoth the Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor; <q>it is ſaid that Truth makes a Libel the more provoking; well, let us agree for once that Truth is a greater Sin than Falſhood; yet as the Offences are not equal, and as the Puniſhment is arbitrary; is it not abſolutely neceſſary that they ſhould know whether the Libel is true or falſe, that they may by that Means be able to proportion the Puniſhment; for would it not be a ſad Caſe, if the Judges, for Want of a due Information, ſhould chance to give as ſevere a Judgement againſt a Man for writing or publiſhing a Lie, as for writing or publiſhing a Truth?</q> Now is it not a ſad Caſe

that he ſhould Want to be told, that human Laws don't ſtrictly regard the moral Pravity of Actions, but their Tendency to hurt the Community, whoſe Peace and Safety are their principal Objects; ſo that by this Standard only are Puniſhments meaſur'd.

The Right of remonſtrating or publiſhing juſt Complaints, the Barriſter thinks the Right of all Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men: And ſo think I, provided ſuch Remonſtrances and Complaints are made in a lawful Way.

the important Diſcovery from his own inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Mouth.</p>
               <p>I know the Law Books aſſert the Right of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining to the <hi>Magiſtrates and Courts of Juſtice,</hi> to the <hi>Parliament,</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> himſelf; but a Right of complaining to the <hi>Neighbours</hi> is what has not occur'd to me. After all, I would not be thought to derogate, by any Thing I have ſaid or ſhall ſay, from that noble Privilege of a free People, <hi>the Liberty of the Preſs.</hi> I think it the Bulwark of all other Liberty; and the ſureſt Defence againſt Tyranny and Oppreſſion. But ſtill it is a Two-edged Weapon, capable of cutting both Ways, and is not therefore to be truſted in the Hands of every diſcontented Fool or deſigning Knave. Men of Senſe and Addreſs (who alone deſerve publick Attention) will ever be able to convey proper Ideas to the People, in a Time of Danger, without running counter to all Order and Decency, or crying <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Murder</hi> thro' the Streets, if they chance to awake from a frightful Dream. But I muſt again urge, that theſe Points are not fit to be diſcuſs'd in a Court of Juſtice, whoſe Juriſdiction is circumſcribed by poſitive and known Laws. Beſides, they take Place properly in a ſovereign State which has no Superior on Earth; and where an injured People can expect no Relief but from an Appeal to Heaven. This is far from being the Caſe of Colonies; and therefore I come to ſhew, under the third Head, that the Barriſter's <hi>Reaſon of the Thing</hi> in no other than <hi>Reaſon inverted,</hi> which poſſibly may help the Project of a <hi>Demagogue</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> but can never be reconcil'd to the Sentiments of a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer, or the Principles of a Patriot, conſider'd as a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>

ſuch a Caſe cannot well happen, and has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet happen'd among them. But here the Barriſter is ready to aſk, how muſt we behave when we are oppreſs'd by a Governor, in a Country where the Courts of Law are ſaid to have no coercive Power over his Perſon, and where the Repreſentatives of the People are, by his Intrigues, made Accomplices of his Iniquity? Certainly it can't be a new Diſcovery to tell this Lawyer; that as the Governor is a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the <hi>Crown,</hi> ſo the moſt natural and eaſy Courſe is to look up to the Hand that made him. And I imagine it may be affirm'd (without catching an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of offering Incenſe to <hi>Majeſty</hi>) that if one half of the Facts contain'd in <hi>Zenger</hi>'s Papers and vouched for true by his Council, had been fairly repreſented and proved at home, Mr. <hi>Coſby</hi> would not have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued much longer in his Government; and then the City of <hi>New-York,</hi> might have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to itſelf the Inſcription of the Gold-Box;<note place="margin">P. 44.</note> 
                  <hi>demerſae leges, temefacta libertas, hae tandem emergunt;</hi> with greater Propriety and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, than could poſſibly be derived from the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Harrange of any Lawyer whatſoever. I am the more embolden'd to ſay thus much, becauſe tho' it is my Lot to dwell in a Colony where <hi>Liberty has not always been well underſtood, at leaſt not freely enjoy'd,</hi> yet I have known a Governor brought to Juſtice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe laſt twenty Years, who was not only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by a Council and Aſſembly, beſides a numerous Party here, but alſo by powerful Friends at Home; all which Advantages were not able to ſcreen him from Cenſure, Diſgrace, and a Removal from the Truſt he had abuſed.</p>
               <p>It is not always neceſſary that particular Perſons ſhould leave their Affairs and Families in the Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to proſecute a Governor in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs their Fortunes are equal to the Expence. For it is ſeldom ſeen that the Violence of a bad Governor terminates in private Injuries; in as much as he can't find his Account in any Thing leſs than what is of a

general and publick Nature. And when this is the Caſe, I hope none of our Colonies are, even at this Time, ſo deſtitute, but that they can find the Means of making a regular Application to their <hi>Sovereign,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Perſon or in his Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> as their Caſe may require.</p>
               <p>But the wild Inconſiſtency that ſhines through moſt Parts of this Orator's Speech,<note place="margin">P. 28.</note> is peculiarly glaring in that Part of it now before me. The Remedy which he ſays our Conſtitution preſcribes for curing or preventing the Diſeaſes of an evil Adminiſtration in the Colonies, I ſhall give in his own Words; <hi>has it not been often ſeen (and I hope it will always be ſeen) that when the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of a free People are, by juſt Repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Remonſtrances, made ſenſible of the Sufferings of their Fellow-ſubjects, by the Abuſe of Power in the Hands of a Governor, they have declared (and loudly too) that they were not obliged by any Law to ſupport a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor who goes about to deſtroy a Province or Colony,</hi> &amp;c. One would imagine, at firſt Sight, that this Man had the ſame Notion, with the Reſt of Mankind, of juſt Repreſentations and Remonſtrances to the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of a free People, which has ever been under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be by Way of Petition or Addreſs directed and preſented to them in Form; in which Caſe it is hoped that they, being moved by the Complaints of the People, will ſtretch forth their Arms to help them. But alas!<note place="margin">P. 29.</note> We are all miſtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; for he tells us, in the ſame Breath, that the right Way is by telling our Sufferings to our Neighbours, in Gazettes and News-Papers; for the Repreſentatives are not to be troubled with every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done by a Governor; beſides they are ſometimes in the Plot with the Governor, and the injured Party can have no Redreſs from their Hand; ſo that the firſt Complaint (inſtead of the laſt Reſort) muſt be to the <hi>Neighbours,</hi> and ſo come about to the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives through that Channel.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="unknown:011573_0018_0F874708A0F9F0B8"/>Now I would be very glad to know, what the <hi>Neighbours</hi> can do towards effecting the deſired Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, that will be attended with ſo good Succeſs and ſo few ill Conſequences, as a regular Application to his Majeſty would be. It would be pleaſant, doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, to hear this Politician ſpeak out, and explain himſelf at large, upon this Subject. I confeſs it ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes my Comprehenſion to conceive what the <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,</hi> inſpired with weekly Revelations from the City Journaliſt, can do with their Governor or Aſſembly, unleſs it be to reform them by thoſe perſuaſive Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which the <hi>Major vis</hi> never wants good Store of.

               </p>
               <p>In a Word; I ſhall agree with the Barriſter (and ſo take my Leave of him) that <hi>the Liberty of expoſing and oppoſing arbitrary Power,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">P. 39.</note> is the Right of a free People; and he ought at the ſame Time to admit that, The order of Things and the Peace of Society require that extraordinary Means ſhould not be uſed, for this Purpoſe, till the Ordinary have failed in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment. The ſupreme Magiſtrate of an <hi>independant Kingdom or State,</hi> cannot always be controul'd by the one, and then the other is juſtified by that Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. But in <hi>Colonies,</hi> that are from their Creation ſubordinate to the Mother-Country, there is no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who is not controulable by regular and well known Methods of proceeding; and conſequently there can be no abſolute Neceſſity of flying to Extremities, at leaſt in the firſt Inſtance. From all which, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, it follows, that <hi>local Conſiderations</hi> upon which the Gentleman lays ſo great Streſs, conclude directly againſt him; and I hope the Security which the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Conſtitution affords to every Man's Perſon, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and Reputation, as well as to the publick Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, is not leſſen'd by any Diſtance from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of Power and Juſtice; but that a <hi>Libel</hi> is a <hi>Libel,</hi> and puniſhable as ſuch in <hi>America</hi> as well as in <hi>Europe.</hi>

               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:011573_0020_0F87470A1D3EB990"/>Virtue and Merit, it is moſt certain, ought to be encouraged, eſpecially by all in Authority; but when that which is meerly counterfeit ſhall gain Eſteem, ſtand in the Room of what is truly genuine, and be actually loaded with the Rewards thereof, it does not only fruſtrate the Original Intention of ſuch Rewards, but likewiſe give Countenance to the Impoſtor, and furniſh him with ſtill further Means of vending his falſe Wares, in Prejudice of the Public. Now this, with all due Submiſſion, I take to be the Caſe of the <hi>Corporation</hi> in <hi>North-America,</hi> with Regard to the Honours they were lately pleaſed to confer on a <hi>noted Barriſter</hi> in thoſe Parts, for his ſuppoſed Services in the Affair of <hi>Zenger</hi> the Printer, whoſe <hi>Tryal</hi> has been ſo plentifully diſpers'd here, and in other Places. Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate Bodies, we find may be miſtaken, and too often are, as well as private Men; and when they do err, it is of the more dangerous Conſequence, on Account of the Extent of their Power and Influence. The Province in general of <hi>New-York,</hi> or the City in particular might, for ought I know, have ſufficient Cauſe of Complaint, in ſome Reſpects, againſt their then Commander in Chief and his Adminiſtration; but it is to be conſidered that as there never was one abſolutely free from Faults, ſo it is the great Privilege of the Inhabitants of every <hi>Britiſh</hi> Government that a proper Channel is chalk'd out, in all ſuch Events, and a Way open for Relief. The Method therefore which the Conſtitution preſcribes ought to be ſtrictly purſued, and any illegal Deviation is not only incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent and unjuſtifiable in itſelf, but has, beſides, a Tendency to introduce Miſchiefs more to be dreaded even than thoſe that were ſought to be redreſs'd. It is the Law which muſt be the Standard of Right and Wrong; and whoever has recourſe to any other Aid, or knowingly adviſes thereto, in the Caſe of particular Grievances, cannot action a true Principle of publick Spirit, but muſt be influenced by unworthy Motives, and is always more or leſs an Enemy to the Community, according to his Situation, and in Proportion to the
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:011573_0020_0F87470A1D3EB990"/>
Talents he happens to poſſeſs. If Mr. <hi>Zenger</hi> then will avowedly publiſh ſeditious Libels againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under which he lives, and his Council will offer to ſupport him by Artifices unbecoming the long Robe, and advancing Propoſitions manifeſtly contrary to Law; as the former deſerves to be puniſhed by it, ſo the latter I humbly preſume to ſay, whatever he may claim from his Client, ought not to be paid his Wages by any Set of Men who owe their Being to the Law, and cannot exiſt without it.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall not ſcruple to acknowledge here, and I do it on no ſuperficial Obſervation, that there can't be a more pernicious Creature in a diſtant Colony, than that of a Practitioner of the Law, with much Aſſurance, little Knowledge, and no Morals; a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter not unheard of in more than one of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Plantations, and which yet I wou'd by no Means apply to Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> any otherwiſe than may appear to be juſt from the Performance he has, it ſeems, taken ſo much Pains to publiſh to the World. The judicious Remarks already made upon it, by <hi>Anglo-Americanus,</hi> will hardly leave Room for any Thing to be added that is very material, and therefore I ſhall content myſelf with a few <hi>Gleanings</hi> only, and make ſome curſory Reflections thereon, whilſt they afford me an Opportunity of bearing my Teſtimony alſo againſt what I think the moſt undecent Behaviour at leaſt, if it may not be called the boldeſt Outrage that ever was exhibited from the Bar without a ſuitable Chaſtiſement.</p>
            <p>Whoever has enquired into the Doctrine of <hi>Libels,</hi> and the Reaſon of their Puniſhment will perceive that they take their Degrees, as they affect private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, particular Magiſtrates, or are aim'd againſt the Government itſelf; and I may venture to ſay that no Lawyer of Reputation will deny, but what is ſet forth in the Information againſt <hi>John Peter Zenger</hi> was of this laſt Kind, and that too, conceived in the groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt Terms, ſuch as will not admit of a different Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, or of any other meaning than what is put
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011573_0021_0F87470B802A7B00"/>
upon them by the Proſecutor for the Crown.

            <p>But it will not be amiſs perhaps, for Example Sake, to give an Inſtance of what has been done on the like Occaſion with that before us; and to this End I ſhall cite a Caſe in the Court of King's Bench, many Years after that of the Star-Chamber was at an End, and which in the Words of Sir <hi>Thomas Raymond,</hi> was as followeth; <q>
                  <hi>Memorandum, June</hi> 18, 1680. Mr. <hi>Nathaniel Reading</hi> having been convicted (before Juſtices of Oyer and Terminer by Virtue of a ſpecial Commiſſion) for endeavouring to perſuade <hi>Bedlow,</hi> who was a Witneſs againſt the Nobleman impriſon'd in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> to forbear his Proſecution of them; and he the ſaid Mr. <hi>Reading</hi> having had Judgement executed upon him by being ſet in the Pillory, and fin'd 1000 <abbr>l.</abbr> and impriſon'd for the ſame, but his Fine ſince pardon'd by the King, came this Day into Court, and demanded that an Information which he there brought in his Hand might be received by Mr. <hi>Aſtrey</hi> againſt the Commiſſioners who condemn'd him, of which my Brother <hi>Jones</hi> and Brother <hi>Dolben</hi> were two, and that the Information may be filed. But the Court did declare that he was in the wrong Way to exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit any Information in this Manner, and did cauſe his Words, whereby he did accuſe the two Judges of Oppreſſion to be recorded; and for theſe Words,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:011573_0022_0F87470B9D39E730"/>
and for that he was infamous by having been in the Pillory, the Gentlemen at the Bar did pray that his Gown might be pull'd over his Ears, he having been formerly a Practiſer at the Bar, which was ordered and executed in Court; and he was alſo condemn'd in Court to pay the King 500 <abbr>l.</abbr> and to lie in Priſon till he paid it. <hi>Raym.

Id.</hi> p. 374, 5.

It may however be noted that the Latter was ſaid to be <hi>artful and affectedly eloquent,</hi> and to have <hi>ſtrove to lead the Judges out of the Way,</hi> while he was told by the Chief Juſtice that his <hi>Defence was artificial, becauſe 'twas nothing to the Purpoſe;</hi> and by another of the Judges, that he <hi>diſgrac'd his Profeſſion by making ſo weak a Defence.</hi> But without adverting to any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Beauties in the <hi>modern Performance,</hi> this is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Counſellor <hi>Reading</hi> loſt the Bar Gown by his <hi>Art,</hi> and Counſellor <hi>Hamilton</hi> got a Gold-Box of five Ounces with the Freedom of the City of <hi>New-York,</hi> by <hi>his.</hi> A pregnant Inſtance of the Capriciouſneſs of Fate, and of the Juſtneſs of your late Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent's Obſervation at the Entrance to his excellent Remarks!</p>

an <hi>Information,</hi> ſo much enviegh'd againſt by <hi>Zenger</hi>'s Counſel, and yet I never heard it cenſur'd at all, as was that of poor <hi>College,</hi> I own, with too good Reaſon.</p>
            <p>It is now Time to take Notice, that there is amidſt a Heap of Jargon and Abſurdities, one obvious Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take which runs throughout Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Harangue, and that is in Relation to the Court of Star-Chamber. He would ſuggeſt that becauſe that Court was aboliſhed by Act of Parliament, on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſome inſufferable Abuſes that had crept into it, all the Caſes that had been adjudged there, on Informations for Libels, were conſequently of no Authority. Whereas the Judgments given there, in Matters properly cognizable before them, which Libel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſpecially was, are allowed to be good Law at this Day, and are conſtantly quoted, as ſuch, in the Court of King's Bench. Indeed it is ſaid that the Reaſon of diſallowing the Star-Chamber Court, was becauſe their Authority was before and now is in <hi>B. R.</hi> and conſequently that Court unneceſſary, <hi>Comb.</hi> 36. So the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Holt</hi> declared that <hi>B. R.</hi> poſſeſt all the lawful power the Star-Chamber had, <hi>Id.</hi> 142. And that the Court of Star-Chamber was taken away, becauſe the Crimes were puniſhable here, 5. <hi>Mods</hi> 464; which is likewiſe intimated by the Statute itſelf. Now tho' I am as well ſatisfyed, perhaps, with the taking away of the Court of Star-Chamber, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Occaſion that had been given, as our northern Barriſter can poſſibly be, and ſhould equally rejoice, I hope, at the redreſſing any other public Grievance; yet I cannot, with him, condemn by the Lump, and argue, that becauſe that Court did ſome Things amiſs, therefore it did nothing right. At this Rate, every Court that had, or has a Being, may be in Danger of the ſame Epithets he loves to beſtow on that we are ſpeaking of; and it may as well be ſuppos'd, that becauſe a certain Set of Citizens, not unknown to Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> lately did a very <hi>ſilly</hi> Thing, they therefore never did a <hi>wiſe</hi> one. For which Reaſon I preſume it will not be altogether impertinent to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:011573_0023_0F87470D40960258"/>
the Sentiments of that Oracle of the Law, Sir <hi>Edward Coke,</hi> concerning the Court of Star-Chamber. <hi>It is</hi> (ſays he) <hi>the moſt honourable Court, our Parliament excepted, that is in the Chriſtian World, both in Reſpect of the Judges, and of their honourable Proceedings accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their juſt Juriſdiction, and the ancient and juſt Orders of the Court. For the Judges of the ſame are the Grandees of the Realm, the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Treaſurer, the Lord Preſident of the King's Council, the Lord Privy Seal, all the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and others of the King's moſt honourable Privy Council, and the principal Judges of the Realm, and ſuch other Lords of Parliament as the King ſhall name. And they judge upon Confeſſion, or Depoſition of Witneſs. And the Court cannot ſit for hearing of Cauſes, under the Number of eight at the leaſt. And it is truly ſaid</hi> Curiae Camerae Stella<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>The Court of Star-Chamber, whilſt kept within due Bounds, was certainly of the greateſt Uſe to preſerve the Peace and Security of the Kingdom; and perhaps was the only Court which by its</hi> ordinary and proper <hi>Juriſdiction, cou'd ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually prevent and puniſh Riots, Perjuries, and other Miſdemeanors of the higheſt Nature. But being made uſe of by the Court to ſupport Proclamations and Orders of State, and to vindicate illegal Commiſſions and Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, that Extenſion of their Power became a Grievance inſupportable, and the Nation was never eaſy till that
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:011573_0024_0F87470DE348F198"/>
Court was entirely ſuppreſs'd by Act of Parliament.</hi> The Houſe of Commons <hi>were ſo eager in their Zeal to deſtroy what they call'd a</hi> Court of Inquiſition, <hi>that tho' the Bill was of ſo great Conſequence, yet they ſent it up to the Lords, with only once reading it, and without its being ever committed, which was a Thing, perhaps never before heard of in Parliament.</hi> Cla. V. 1. 223.</p>
            <p>I need only add on this Head that the Crime of <hi>Libelling</hi> is the ſame now as it was while the Court of Star-Chamber ſubſiſted, and the Nature of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence the ſame then, as now; a Crime that muſt neceſſarily be puniſhed, as long as there are States and Communities eſtabliſhed in the World. And our aſſuming Barriſter will not find an Author that treats of the Crown Law ſince the Statute of 16 <hi>Ch.</hi> 1. <hi>Ch.</hi> 10. any more than before, but makes uſe of the Caſes adjudged in the Star-Chamber generally as good Law, and of equal Authority in thoſe Matters with ſuch as were afterwards adjudged in the King's Bench. Some indeed are juſtly liable to Exception in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, as we have alſo known too many in the latter, particularly during the next ſucceeding Reign of <hi>Ch.</hi> 2. none whereof are, however, God be praiſed, to be met with, or heard of ſince the glorious and happy Revolution in 1688, which I truſt has for ever exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all Partiality and Oppreſſion from <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the learned Lawyer of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> declares that <hi>he has not in all his reading, met with an Authority that ſays we cannot be admitted to give the Truth in Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon an Information for a Libel.</hi> I don't know what this Gentleman's reading may be; but if he had read ſome of the Caſes above mentioned which cou'd not well eſcape him, it might reaſonably have been expected he would have taken Warning, been a little more cautious, and not have ventur'd to incur the Penalties which others before him had ſo juſtly ſuffer'd. By <hi>all his Reading,</hi> he wou'd inſinuate, I ſuppoſe, that he had <hi>read all;</hi> and if that was true, it might well be thought he had read to very little Purpoſe, who
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:011573_0024_0F87470DE348F198"/>
could make ſo ill an Uſe of it; or think it <hi>a Duty on him to go to the utmoſt Part of the Land,</hi> to propagate Doctrines and Principles diametrically oppoſite to, and juſt the Reverſe of what he muſt have read. We ſhall ſoon diſcover that the Barriſter's Reading is not quite ſo extenſive as he would have it imagin'd. But it is previouſly to be obſerved that if there were no ſuch Authority <hi>in terminis</hi> as that he calls for, a Man who reads with any tolerable Underſtanding wou'd of Courſe infer the ſame Thing, when all the Books on the Subject of Libels lay it down as a Rule, which they unanimouſly do, <hi>that it is not material whether the Libel be true or falſe.</hi> For if that be not material, to what end ſhou'd the Truth be offer'd in Evidence? Or how ſhou'd it be rejected before, it was offer'd which undoubtedly is the Reaſon that there have been no late Inſtances of that Sort. It might ſuffice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to undertake as often as this well-read Lawyer produced a Precedent of its being demanded from the Bar to give Evidence of the Truth of a Libel, to ſhew that it was as often deny'd by the Court. And tho' I admit it has been attempted before, on Tryals for Libels of the leſs enormous Kinds, yet he is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the only one that has done it in any Caſe within theſe 100 Years. However if we would find an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that Sort, we muſt neceſſarily have Recourſe to the Proceedings of the Court where that Crime was uſually puniſhed. The <hi>Star-Chamber Reports</hi> then may ſatisfy Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> that <hi>Term Paſe.</hi> 7 <hi>Car.</hi> 1. there was the Caſe of <hi>Coſton,</hi> Gent. v. <hi>Hitcham Mil Servien. ad legem,</hi> as follows. <q>The Defendant the Morning before he went to the Seſſions, being a Juſtice of the Peace, received ſcandalous and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellous Articles againſt the Plaintiff, carry'd them to the Seſſions in his Pocket, and in open Court, in diſgrace of the Plaintiff, pull'd them out, and ſaid you ſhall ſee what a lewd Fellow this is, and not fit to ſpeak in this Place, and then cauſe the ſaid libellous Articles to be read in the publick Seſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. And the Plaintiff then deſiring a Copy of
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:011573_0025_0F8746BB4BF33440"/>
them and to be try'd upon them, the Witneſſes to prove them being noted in the Margin, the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant did not ſuffer him to have a Copy or to be try'd there upon, nor took any Courſe that he might at the next Seſſions, or at any Time after be queſtion'd for them, but took the Articles again out of the Seſſions and carried them away. And after, further to diſgrace the Plaintiff in his Practice (being an Attorney) ſent the ſaid Articles to Mr. Juſtice <hi>Harvey</hi> at the Reference of a Cauſe to him, which <hi>Caſton</hi> attended; and a Jury having given a Verdict againſt the Defendant, he ſent for the Jurors and queſtion'd them about their Verdict, and told them they were a Company of Fools, and that if there had been but one wiſe Man among them their Verdict had not been ſo And for theſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences he was committed to the Fleet and fin'd 200 <abbr>l.</abbr> In this Cauſe, the Defendant wou'd have had Witneſſes to prove the Matter of the ſaid ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Articles to be true, but that was diſallowed by the Court. <hi>Ruſhw Col vol.</hi> 3. <hi>P.</hi> 36. <hi>in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.</hi>
               </q> This I preſume the Barriſter when he is ſerious will allow to be in Point, tho' it happen'd not to fall in the Way of his Reading. He cannot object ſurely that it does not appear to be on an Information prefer'd by an Attorney General, ſince it is a much ſtronger Caſe than if it had. For if the Court would not receive ſuch Evidence in a Cauſe depending on the Complaint of a petty Sollicitor for being libell'd, and this too preferred againſt a Juſtice of Peace, a Knight and a Serjeant at Law, <hi>a fortiori,</hi> they wou'd never admit it on an Information exhibited by his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Attorney-General againſt a private Perſon for libelling the Government.</p>

On the contrary, if he had dipt into the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Keling</hi>'s Reports, Fol. 23. (before he left his Chambers) he would have there found it reſolv'd by the whole Court that <hi>tho' a Counſellor at Law may plead his Client's Cauſe againſt the King, yet if under Colour of that, he takes upon him to vent Sedition, he is to be puniſh'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is no Wonder indeed, if our Barriſter ſhou'd be unapprized of <hi>Brereton</hi>'s Caſe, it not being (at leaſt to my Knowledge) in Print; and you perceive I was under no Neceſſity of mentioning it, being before provided with an Authority to my Purpoſe. But it is reported as above, in <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Part</hi> II. <hi>Conſid.</hi> 12.</note> Sir <hi>Thomas Mallet</hi>'s M. S. Treatiſe of the Court of Star-Chamber, a Copy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of has fallen into my Hands by the Favour of a Friend. And ſince I have named this Work, I ſhall, with his Leave take a Paragraph out of it, which I'm perſuaded will not be deem'd unſuitable to the preſent Debate, after hinting that the Book ſeems to be wrote in the Time of <hi>James</hi> I. when the Doctrine now revived, and ſo tenaciouſly advanced by Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> is ſaid to have been <hi>long before exploded as a groſs Error.</hi> 
               <q>There are (ſays Sir Thomas) two groſs Errors crept into the World concerning Libels; the one that it is no Libel if the Party put his Hand unto
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:011573_0026_0F8746BB5F9F61F8"/>
it; and the other that it is not a Libel if it be true; both which have been long ſince exploded out of this Court. For the firſt, the Cauſe why the Law puniſheth Libels, is for that they tend to raiſe the Breach of the Peace, which may as well be done, and more eaſily when the Hand is ſubſcribed, then when it is not. And for the other, it hath been ever agreed that it is not the Matter, but the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which is puniſhable. For libelling againſt a common Strumpet is as great an Offence as againſt an honeſt Woman, and perhaps more dangerous to the Breach of the Peace; for, as the Woman ſaid, ſhe ſhould never grieve to be told of her red Noſe if ſhe had not one indeed. Neither is it a Ground to examine the Truth or Falſhood of a Libel, becauſe it is <hi>ſub Judice,</hi> whether it be a Libel or not; for that takes away <hi>Subjectum Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis,</hi> and determines it to be no Libel, by admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Defendant to prove the Truth, and the Defendant in that Caſe ought to plead a Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Demur in Law; but if he plead not guilty, the Queſtion is gone, whether it be a Libel or not.</q> Thus, according to this Author's Opinion, who if I miſtake not, was one of the Juſtices of the Court of King's Bench in his Time, Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> cou'd he really have perſuaded himſelf that the Matters charged in the Information were not libellous, as he <hi>inſiſts they are not,</hi> would have diſcovered more Accuracy in his Profeſſion, as well as Candour in his Practice, by adviſing his Client to <hi>Demur</hi> to it, whereby he wou'd have admitted no more than what was avowed at the Tryal on the general Iſſue. Then indeed it would have fairly come before the Court to be conſidered whether the Papers were libellous or not, and he as Counſel for the Defendant, might regularly have been heard to it. He wou'd then have been at Liberty to exert his uncommon Talents, manifeſt his extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Reading, his ſuperior Genius and great Skill in Language, and in explaining the true import of Words, without ſo directly flying in the Face of every Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:011573_0026_0F8746BB5F9F61F8"/>
and oppoſing all the Caſes that ever were adjudged concerning <hi>Libels,</hi> before he was born, and ſince. But, alas! That wou'd not have anſwered the Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our eloquent Barriſter. He wou'd not then have had it in his Power to uſe his Arts, and play his Game with a Dozen honeſt Men of as good natural Underſtandings perhaps, tho' not of equal Experience and Cunning with himſelf. If he had gone that way to Work, he wou'd have had no chance for the Prize. Vain had been his Expedition, and loſt, entirely loſt, all his Labour. In a Word, if the Learning and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of the Bar only were required, he might as well have ſtayed at home, where, if I am rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, their are Inſtances in Abundance of the bleſſed Effects of Mr. <hi>Hamilton's well-known Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſagacious Gentleman <hi>begs Leave to obſerve, that Informations for Libels, is a Child, if not born, yet nurs'd up and brought to full Maturity in the Court of Star-Chamber:</hi> But what is particularly to be inferr'd from this ſhrewd Obſervation, he does not at preſent tell us. If the Star-Chamber was the Court where Crimes of this Nature were generally puniſhed, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its ordinary and proper Juriſdiction, as it certainly was, how ſhould it be otherwiſe than that Informations for Libels muſt be met with there? And conſidering the Antiquity of that Court, 'tis more than probable the Crime was firſt proſecuted and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in it. But what then? Is the Legitimacy of the Child (if I may be allowed to carry on the Metaphor) therefore to be call'd in Queſtion? Or its Education the leſs honourable? I might put our witty Barriſter in Mind, that what I have mentioned is the very Reaſon why the <hi>ſpurious Brat</hi> he is ſo fond of, which was never brought to full Maturity, nor ever will, firſt appeared in the Star-Chamber, tho' it has not been heard of ſince in any other Court till very lately at <hi>New-York,</hi> I mean that of making Falſhood to be eſſential to a Libel, and claiming a Right to give Evidence of the Truth of it by Way of Juſtification.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:011573_0027_0F8746BC22063C50"/>He muſt however intend by the foregoing Paſſage to impeach the Legality of Informations <hi>qua</hi> ſuch (which by ſome Words that drop from him many Pages after, would ſeem to be what he aims at) or as they relate only to <hi>Libels;</hi> and in either Caſe he will again betray the Scantineſs of his Reading and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Law. As to informations in general, it has been inconteſtibly prov'd that this Method of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding is <hi>no Way contrarient to any Fundamental Rule of Law, but agreeable to it.</hi> That it was the <hi>conſtant Uſage and had the Approbation of the Judges and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers of all Ages, and in all Reigns.</hi> Show Rep. 106, to 125. And in the Caſe of the Information againſt Seventy poor Perſons for a Riot in pulling down Fences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 2 <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>M.</hi> (which probably may be the ſame) it was ſaid by Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Holt,</hi> that <q>the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hales</hi> complain'd of the Abuſe of Informations, but not that they were unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful;—That he ſhould not come now and impeach the Judgment of all his Predeceſſors;—That the Star-Chamber was not ſet up by the Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. but was at Common Law, and Informations were accordingly brought in that Court and others. And the whole Court were of Opinion that Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations lay at common Law, 5 <hi>Mod.</hi> 463, 4.</q> Now this I take to be as good an Authority as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trajudical Opinion of thoſe anonymous <hi>great Men</hi> who Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> ſays, <hi>have boldly aſſerted that the Mode of Proſecution by Information is a national Grievance, and greatly inconſiſtent with the Freedom which the Subjects of</hi> England <hi>enjoy in moſt other Caſes;</hi> nor can one forbear obſerving, <hi>en paſſant,</hi> that he ſeems much more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, where there is no Danger at leaſt, to follow the Example of <hi>bold,</hi> than of <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>judicious</hi> Men.</p>
            <p>This then being a legal Courſe of Proceeding in Criminal Caſes, and for all publick Offences, it muſt undeniably be as proper in the Caſe of Libels as in any others. And Sir <hi>B. Shower</hi> in reckoning up the ſeveral Crimes that were cognizable in the Court of <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> includes <hi>Libels</hi> among the reſt, for
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:011573_0027_0F8746BC22063C50"/>
which he ſays, <hi>There were always Informations in the Star-Chamber and King's-Bench,</hi> Show. 119. I am the more free in borrowing what I do from that emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Practiſer, on the Subject of Informations, becauſe he had ſtudied it well, and taken more than uſual Pains therein; and as the Judgement afterwards given by the Court of King's-Bench was purſuant thereto, ſo it ſeems to have put a Period in Weſtminſter-Hall to all Cavils againſt that <hi>Mode of Proſecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the Barriſter means notwithſtanding to ſuggeſt moreover, that Informations for Libels are but of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Date, or little longer Standing then about the Time of the Expiration of that Court, where he ſuppoſes they had their Origin, let him be further refuted by the abovementioned Sir <hi>Thomas Mallet,</hi> who wrote profeſſedly on the Court of Star-Chamber, and may be ſuppoſed to be pretty well acquainted with his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.

               <q>In all Ages Libels have been ſeverely puniſhed in this Court, but moſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially they began to grow frequent about 42 and 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi> when Sir <hi>Edward Coke</hi> was her Attorney General.</q> And, treating of the Antiquity of that Court he makes it very probable, <note n="†" place="bottom">Id. <hi>1</hi> Part, 4th Conſid.</note>

Now 'twas while this conſummate Lawyer it ſeems was Attorney General to the renowned Queen <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi> that Informations for Libels began to be moſt frequent, or in Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s elegant Stile, when <hi>the Child was brought to full Maturity:</hi> And it is readily ſubmitted to all who are vers'd in our Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and Conſtitution, whether that Period will be any Diſparagement to the Offspring.</p>
            <p>But if Informations for Libels in particular were one of the Grievances of that Court, nay the chief, as the Barriſter would labour to make his Hearers believe,

how came they to be practis'd after the Aboliſhment of it? Or what will he ſay to the Caſe of the <hi>King</hi> againſt <hi>Darby,</hi> which was an Information exhibited againſt the Defendant, being an Attorney of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Pleas, for <hi>defamatory Words</hi> only of Sir <hi>John Key,</hi> a Juſtice of Peace, concerning the Exerciſe of his Office? The Words were, as they are ſet forth in <hi>Comb.</hi> 65. <hi>Sir</hi> John Key <hi>is a Buffle-headed Fellow,</hi> (a pretty Thing to be proved in Court!) <hi>underſtands not Law, and is not fit to diſcourſe it with me; he hath not done Juſtice to my Client.</hi> There it was argued for the Defendant on a Demurrer, (and I chooſe to recite it becauſe of the Conceſſions of his Council againſt our Northern Advocate) <q>That an Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would not lie for ſcandalous Words ſpoken only of a particular Perſon, becauſe he might have an Action on the Caſe to recompence him in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages. 'Tis true ſuch a Proceeding might be warranted for Libels, or for diſperſing defamatory Letters, becauſe by ſuch Means the publick Peace might be diſturbed, and Diſcords fomented amongſt Neighbours, which might at laſt be a publick In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury: But there is no ſuch Thing alledged in this Caſe, only Words in common Diſcourſe, for which an Action on the Caſe might lie, but no <hi>Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> On the other Side it was inſiſted, That this Information was founded on ſufficient Matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Proſecution is not only as it reſpects the Perſon of Sir <hi>John Key,</hi> but it relates to him as he is a publick Magiſtrate, and who is ſubordinate to the Government, and therefore ſuch defamatory Words are a Reproach to the ſupreme Governor, by whom Magiſtrates are intruſted and from whom they derive their Authority; and it will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd, but that Words reflecting on the publick Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment are puniſhable at the Suit of the King by an Information.—And for this Reaſon the Court held that an Information would lie, and thereupon gave Judgment againſt the Defendant, and fined him an Hundred Marks. <hi>Carth.</hi> 14, 15.</q>

               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:011573_0028_0F8746BD0DF8F720"/>Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> who would ſeem to be more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than his Neighbours in many Things, affects to be more ignorant than every Body, of what conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes a <hi>Libel;</hi> and therefore altho' he pretends <hi>freely to acknowledge there are ſuch Things as Libels,</hi> yet he <hi>inſiſts at the ſame Time, that what his Client is charg'd with, is not one;</hi> and if it be not, I will as freely ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge there can be no ſuch Thing. He deſires the Attorney-General <hi>to favour them with ſome Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard Definition of a Libel, by which it may be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly known whether a Writing be a Libel, yea, or not.</hi> And what is this for? Why truly to <hi>ſhorten the Diſpute.</hi> But what Diſpute does he ſpeak of? The only Point that could admit of Diſpute had been given up before by his confeſſing the Matters in Iſſue, and the Proſecutor's Witneſſes, being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon diſcharg'd. As to what he requires, either there was ſuch a Definition to be met with in the Books, or there was not; if there was, he ought to have known it; if there was not, why ſhould he deſire Mr. Attorney to <hi>favour</hi> him with one? Yet after he had been indulg'd beyond Meaſure, and a Definition was produc'd from a good Author, who beſides refers to ſeveral others that are unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, all which conclude againſt his Client; is this loquatious Advocate contented? No. <hi>There are two Words to that Bargain,</hi> as he had ſaid before. He makes it a Foundation for further Diſputes, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his wonted Ingenuity and Candour through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his <hi>Reverie</hi> calls the concurrent Senſe of our Books, Mr. <hi>Attorney's Rule,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Attorney's Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>But what certain Standard Rule, <hi>quoth he,</hi> have the Books laid down, by which we can certainly know whether the Words are malicious? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are defamatory? Whether they tend to a Breach of the Peace? And are a ſufficient Ground to provoke a Man, his Family or Friends to Acts of Revenge? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> Now theſe Queries methinks do not ſo well become the Mouth of an Advocate as they might that of his Client, when abandon'd to his
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:011573_0029_0F8746BDDB62F4B0"/>
own Defence in a deſperate Cauſe. But I anſwer, no Rules certainly can be of Uſe to thoſe, who are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd to act without any, or in Oppoſition to all Rules, in which Claſs our Northern Barriſter muſt be plac'd, if we are to frame a Judgement of him from the Share he bore in this Tryal. The Rule laid down in our Books concerning <hi>Libels</hi> (I ſpeak of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels in the ſtrict Senſe) according to the Definition of Mr. Serjeant <hi>Hawkins</hi> referr'd to in the Tryal, and which alone concerns the preſent Caſe, is founded on the Reaſon of the Thing; and is the ſame which is to be obſerved in other Matters that depend upon the Conſtruction of Words and Writings, which are Signs only, or Images of Ideas intended to be conveyed to the Underſtandings of the Reader. There may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, be divers Rules apply'd according to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the Caſe, and this among the Reſt, that where Words are capable of two Senſes, the one faulty, the other innocent; the latter is to be taken, provided ſuch a Conſtruction may be made without violence to their natural Import and Meaning. From whence it will follow, that the ſame Caſes may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that are doubtful and do not come under any Standard Rule, on all which Occaſions honeſt and upright Judges will incline to the favourable Side; there may be others again ſo clear and evident, that a Man muſt reſign his Reaſon, or reſolve to ſacrifice his Conſcience that does not diſcern, or will not allow them to be Libellous. But in none of theſe Caſes can it come properly to be a Queſtion before the Jury whether a Libel or not on the Plea of not Guilty, tho' it might afterwards be ſo, before the Court in Arreſt of Judgement. By what has been ſaid, there appears to be Latitude enough for a ſkilful Pen, (who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding muſt do it at his Peril) to laſh publick and private Vices, to caution the People againſt Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that may be hurtful to them, or to remonſtrate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the evil Practices even of thoſe in Power, without being always expos'd to the Penalties of the Law. Such a Liberty of writing and printing under

due Reſtrictions, I own <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> ought not, and I hope never will be depriv'd of, and where this is dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triouſly done, it would be ridiculous for private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to put the Cap on their own Heads, and no leſs impolitick for thoſe in high Stations to apply every Thing to their Adminiſtration. When ſuch a Work is undertaken by able Hands, and with a generous View of ſerving the Publick, it is always laudable, and often very uſeful; but to ſucceed herein, requires a Capacity and Talents, not to be diſcovered in Mr. <hi>Zenger</hi>'s News-Papers, or his <hi>Council</hi>'s Speech.</p>
            <p>I perceive my Letter is unawares run to a great Length, by the Quotations that are interſpers'd, and which yet I am ſenſible is the leaſt exceptionable Part of it. I ſhall therefore take Notice but of one Thing more in this matchleſs Harangue, which indeed ought not to be forgot, becauſe it is made the Baſis and Foundation of the whole; and that is concerning the <hi>Right of Freemen to complain when they are hurt.</hi> This our Lawyer often aſſerts in general Terms, with ſome Variation only of the Expreſſion. As to which, I wou'd aſk, whether by it he Means a Right to remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate and complain in a legal Way, or a Right in all Caſes to appeal to the People by ſeditious and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Libels? If the former, no Body ever deny'd it, and what he ſaid was not <hi>ad idem;</hi> ſo that he was fighting with the Air, and quarrelling without an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary. If the latter, he diſhonour'd his Gown by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing what is notoriouſly repugnant to all Laws human and divine. It was rul'd in the Court of <hi>B. R.

<pb n="58" facs="unknown:011573_0030_0F8746BE797C6670"/>
to reſort unto her <hi>ad faciendum Querimoniam,</hi> yet if a Subject, after the Bill once exhibited, will divulge the Matter therein comprehended, to the Diſgrace and Diſcredit of the Perſon intended, it is good Cauſe of Action, 3 <hi>Leon.</hi> 138. And to the ſame Purpoſe, in a much later Caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that of <hi>Lake</hi> and <hi>King,</hi> reported in many of our Books, to which Mr. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant <hi>Hawkins</hi> refers, it ſeems agreed, as he obſerves, that whoever delivers a Paper full of Reflection on any Perſon in Nature of a Petition to a Committee of Parliament, to any other Perſon except the Members of Parliament, may be puniſhed as the Publiſher of a Libel, in Reſpect of ſuch a diſperſing thereof among thoſe who have nothing to do with it. 1 <hi>Hawk.

            <p>But our forward Barriſter, <hi>aged and infirm</hi> as he repreſents himſelf (which compar'd with his Conduct is the keeneſt Satyr that could be ſuggeſted of him) ought to be further inſtructed, that even where Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints are to the King himſelf, they muſt be made in a proper and regular Manner, a Decency is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, and a Regard always had to the Characters and Stations of the Perſons againſt whom ſuch Complaints are made.
