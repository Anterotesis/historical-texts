            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE laudable <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> made by the worthy Inhabitants of this ancient TOWN, for celebrating the wonder-working pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of GOD in favour of its <hi>firſt ſettlers</hi> when few in number and weak in ſtrength, demands our ſerious attention, and the approbation of all who ſay in their hearts <hi>let the Lord be magnified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many were the afflictions, and as many the favourable interpoſitions of Providence, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced by our <hi>Anceſtors</hi> from the time of their firſt eſſays to quit their native land, till they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived and ſettled in this. A proper recollection of theſe things, hath a happy tendency to impreſs our minds with a becoming Senſe of GOD and the goodneſs of Providence to his ſuffering people.</p>
            <p>To ſtir up our minds by way of remembrance, a great many things have been well ſaid upon the occaſion by my worthy Brethren who have gone before me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:015256_0005_0F988329BA222420"/>The moſt noted <hi>hiſtorical facts,</hi> relative to the coming over of our fore-fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have been named in the firſt public Sermon on this occaſion, from <hi>Pſalm</hi> lxxviii.5, 6, 7. Alſo their ſmallneſs in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ſtrength and wealth, and the duty of not deſpiſing the day of ſmall things, in another Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, from <hi>Zech.</hi> iv.10. The general nature of that freedom, civil and religious, to which we have all an equal right—the embarraſſments that tyranny and oppreſſion throw in the way of the exerciſe of ſuch freedom, and the duty of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to re-aſſume it, if poſſible, when it is wreſted from them, in another, from <hi>Gen.</hi> i.31, and <hi>Pſ.</hi> cxix.134. And laſtly, a repreſentation of the heroic faith of Abraham exemplified, in ſome meaſure, by our pious fore-fathers, in a fourth Sermon, from <hi>Heb.</hi> xi.8. Theſe things have been ſet before you already; and <hi>what ſhall we ſay more?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Time would fail us, to give you a full narrative of the viciſſitudes that they and theirs paſſed thro'—the ſuffering they underwent—the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian courage, patience, faith and fortitude they maintained, and their final ſucceſs, growth and increaſe, notwithſtanding the trials and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that befell them during the deſpotic reigns of the four <hi>Kings</hi> of the <hi>Stuart Houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Methinks it may be ſaid of theſe firſt emigrants and their ſucceſſors, as was ſaid of the Iſraelites in the text, <hi>the more they</hi> (their adverſaries) <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted them, the more they</hi> (the ſufferers) <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied and grew</hi>—grew in the chriſtian graces and virtues; and at length, in numbers, wealth and ſtrength, ſo that finally (the oppreſſive meaſures
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015256_0006_0F98832A7ACC0080"/>
taken againſt them notwithſtanding) they roſe from ſmall beginnings to become a numerous and flouriſhing people.</p>
            <p>It is a truth worthy our notice, and let it be the general obſervation from the text, that, <hi>When</hi> GOD <hi>deſigns the growth and increaſe of a people, even the afflictions they meet with ſhall be over-ruled to promote the ſame.</hi> So it hath been, and ſo it will be; and nothing under heaven ſhall be able to prevent it.</p>
            <p>If the Lord is determined that a people ſhall grow and multiply, either in the natural, civil, or religious way; no tribulation, or perſecution, or any kind of affliction from their adverſaries ſhall diſappoint him of his purpoſe. <hi>Surely there is no enchantment againſt Jacob, neither is there any divination againſt Iſrael.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Numbers xxiii.231.</note>
            </p>
            <p>We are ſenſible that <hi>affliction</hi> is a general term that ſignifieth trouble, diſtreſs and adverſity, ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either from cruel oppreſſion and perſecution, or from wiſe correction and juſt puniſhment; for tho' there is a wide difference between oppreſſion, and proper correction, as the one is always wrong, and the other always right, yet they are both afflictive to the party oppreſſed, or corrected.</p>
            <p>The natural <hi>tendency</hi> of affliction, is, to waſte, diminiſh and deſtroy the afflicted; and this will be the iſſue, in caſe the affliction riſes and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, unleſs the providence of GOD prevents it. This might eaſily be demonstrated by a courſe of plain reaſoning; but this method to prove the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015256_0007_0F98832B3A09C9C0"/>
tendency of affliction is needleſs, becauſe we have ſtriking inſtances of the fact in the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual decreaſe of the abuſed <hi>Africans</hi> in the Weſt-India Iſlands. Their afflictions and bondage are ſo many and great, that inſtead of multiplying and growing, it is quite the reverſe, they diminiſh and periſh ſo faſt under the cruel hand of oppreſſion, that the proprietors or planters are obliged to ſend for new recruits of many thouſands every few years to keep their numbers good and their lucrative buſineſs going on. The inhumanity, cruelty and wickedneſs of the practice is a great deal blacker than the miſerable creatures themſelves.</p>
            <p>But however true it is, that affliction is ruinous in its natural tendency, yet thro' the merciful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of GOD it takes a <hi>new direction,</hi> and, in regard to its effects, it becomes good and ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary both to individuals and communities. Under the influence of GOD, the fruit of affliction is the taking away of ſin, the reformation of manners, and the enlargement and ſalvation of a people. This may be called the <hi>providential tendency</hi> of affliction, and this is the way that good is brought out of evil.</p>
            <p>Whenever we are afflicted, either by the hand of GOD or man, it is generally ſuppoſed that we have offended and merit the rod. This is always true when the Almighty afflicts us, and, with the ſtricteſt propriety, we may adopt the confeſſion of Nehemiah, <hi>thou hast done right, but we have done wickedly.</hi> But this is not always true when we are afflicted by the hands of men; i. e. we do not always deſerve it of them. They ſometimes,
<pb n="9"
                   facs="unknown:015256_0008_0F98832BFA1F5D30"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
either through ignorance or ill will, make an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt judgment, and a wrong application; and hence they puniſh the innocent, or cauſe the guilty to be puniſhed beyond the demerit of his offence. In both caſes (unavoidable ignorance excepted) they are chargeable with injuſtice and oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>We know that <hi>ignorance,</hi> be it moral or politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, is not the proper ſubject of penalty; and that he who offends only in one degree is not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſubject of ten, or of two degrees of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Hence, they who knowingly miniſter a ſtripe where none is due, or two ſtripes where but one is due (be they Parents, Maſters or Magiſtrates that do it, either againſt an individual or againſt a community) they act the part of oppreſſors and tyrants, and may juſtly expect to hear from the Almighty that ſevere reprimand, <hi>what mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor.</hi>

            <p>When a <hi>Child,</hi> that is grown to the ſtate of manhood and ſelf-government, and is ſet at liberty by the laws of GOD and man, to regulate and take care of himſelf, hath, by his induſtry, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for his own ſubſiſtence, how baſe and wicked is it for his <hi>Parents</hi> to ſeize the fruit of his labor—to demand the ſurrender of his perſon and property to their arbitrary diſpoſal, and make his refuſal ſuch a capital offence as to purſue him with vengeance? A proceeding ſimilar to this, either in a family or civil ſtate, is nothing ſhort of high-handed oppreſſion and cruelty; and for parents or magiſtrates to plead any human law
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015256_0009_0F98832CBADA3538"/>
whatſoever in vindication of ſuch practice, does no more exculpate them than it did the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous witneſſes againſt our Saviour to plead and ſay, <hi>we have a law, and by our law he ought to die.</hi>*</p>
            <p>Any law or inſtitution contrary to the law of GOD, or againſt the good of the people, is a law that eſtabliſheth iniquity: and the execution of it produceth an affliction ſo painful and grievous that it cannot and ought not to be borne without reſiſtance, or making ſome eſſay for deliverance, agreeably to the principle of ſelf-defence.</p>
            <p>We further add,</p>
            <p>Afflictions of any kind that are pungent, do lay the afflicted under neceſſity of ſtruggling, in order to extricate themſelves. If it be a profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate ſinner, whoſe conſcience is afflicted with a ſenſe of his ſin, guilt, and danger of the wrath to come, his enquiry will be, <hi>what ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> If a chriſtian or a chriſtian church be afflicted with a ſenſe of apoſtacy and of the divine correction, their concern and exertion will be to repent, reform, and be reſtored to the peace and love of GOD. If it be a civil community, afflicted with public oppreſſion—with a ſenſe of the loſs, or the danger of loſing their natural or ſtipulated rights, it preſently moves them to ſeek, deviſe and and proſecute ways and means of freedom and ſafety; a kind of neceſſity is laid upon them ſo to do. In this caſe the old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb is verified, <hi>Neceſſity is the mother of inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; ſhe is a fruitful mother, and the neceſſitous
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015256_0010_0F98832D7A1E43F0"/>
and afflicted find themſelves preſs'd and conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to exert their wiſdom, genius, and all their inventive powers for their ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Now, when the providence of GOD directs and aſſiſts the awakened genius of ſuch an afflicted people, they are often led to ſearch out and make diſcovery of thoſe means and ways of defence and relief, which otherwiſe they neither would have attempted, or even thought of; however, the iſſue of theſe efforts hath often been the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance and enlargement of a people. And this is what we obſerve, that, the ſame afflictions and oppreſſions which naturally tend to ruin, lay waſte and deſtroy a body of people, are nevertheleſs, under GOD's directing influence, the means and occaſion of their riſing to a free and flouriſhing ſtate.</p>
            <p>Civil communities, as well as chriſtians, and chriſtian churches, have experienced the truth of what is here aſſerted, and to confirm the ſame, appeals may be made to ſacred and prophane hiſtory, from both of which the point will be lilucidated.</p>
            <p>The growth and increaſe of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the afflictions, ſlavery and bondage of <hi>Egypt,</hi> is to the purpoſe. Their adverſaries (deaf to the demand of GOD, <hi>let my people go that they may ſerve me;</hi> and deaf to the cries and petitions of the afflicted) racked their invention to find out ways and means to waſte, diſhearten and deſtroy them. To this end ſpake the Egyptian Monarch to his noble Lords, ſaying, <hi>come on, let us deal wiſely

            <p>GOD who knoweth all things, foreſeeing the afflictions that his ſervants (the firſt ſettlers here) would endure for his name; and determining to bring them, and with them the Goſpel and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of it to this land, made early and effectual proviſion for the ſame.

            <p>It muſt be noted that the civil and eccleſiaſtical powers of England at this time, were againſt them, on account of their puritan principles.

               </note> his principles laid a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the perſecuting meaſures that he (and his ſucceſſors) afterward purſued. His political principles were deſpotic, and his religious ones were a motly mixture of popery and preſbytery, which, with violence, he endeavored to make his ſubjects ſwallow.<note n="‡" place="bottom">As <hi>Granvill</hi> in his hiſtory of the wars of England tells us.</note> To this purpoſe, he (with the high-tempered Biſhops) propoſed, and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently urged a <hi>ſubſcription</hi> to the books of prayer, and all the articles and ceremonies of the church of England, <note n="§" place="bottom">Firſt ſet on foot in Queen Elizabeth's reign, and now revived with great ſpirit and a pointed deſign againſt the diſſenting clergy.</note> threatning the delinquents with ſevere puniſhment.

            <p>Their firſt flight from theſe oppreſſors was to <hi>Holland,</hi> and in about eleven years after, many of them took their departure from <hi>Europe</hi> for this country.<note n="†" place="bottom">In the year 1620, and arrived at Cape Cod in November.</note> Their departure was attended with very great difficulties, loſſes and diſtreſſes.

            </p>
            <p>After they had taken their final departure from Europe—croſſed the atlantic, and landed on this ſhore, they had a great many evils to combat. They were diſtreſſed on every ſide, and a gloomy proſpect opened to view. The ocean behind them, a wilderneſs before them, and the ſeverities of winter ſwiftly approaching. They were ſoon viſited with cold, hunger and ſickneſs, which ſwept off nearly one half their number, among whom were ſome of their leading and beſt men. In this feeble ſtate they were often alarmed and aſſaulted by the Savages of the wilderneſs, and had no where to look for protection but to the GOD of heaven.</p>
            <p>One might reaſonably think that the diſtreſſes of this afflicted people would excite the compaſſion of their adverſaries, eſpecially ſince they were rid of their company; but it was quite the reverſe. Their enemies purſued them without mercy, and endeavoured to rob them of their privileges in this, as they had done in their native land.

            <p>It muſt be owned, with gratitude to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that this afflicted people had ſome friends remaining in their native land; and no doubt we have too, the violence of the public meaſures taken againſt us notwithſtanding; but the governing part was unfriendly to them; and to a very high degree they are ſo to us their poſterity, as appears from their readineſs to hear and credit the falſe reports of our enemies—enacting ſuch reſtraining laws as go beyond the limits of the conſtitution—appointing governors and other officers unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the natural and ſtipulated rights of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple—vacating charters without any adequate of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence—pulling down the hedges that royal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity once ſet up for our defence, and hereby open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a way for what we now ſee and feel, namely, enormous fleets and armies, with commiſſion and

            <p>Let us now turn our thoughts to a more light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome ſcene, and briefly view the <hi>growth</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of this afflicted people under the numerous trials they meet with. GOD, minding to bring them from Europe and ſettle them in this country, at the appointed time, took them on the wings of his providence <note n="*" place="bottom">In alluſion to <hi>Deut.</hi> xxxii.11. <hi>As an eagle—fluttereth over her young, ſpreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth, them on her wings; ſo the Lord alone did lead them,</hi> &amp;c.</note> and wafted them over here. He ſet their feet upon a rock, and eſtabliſhed them ſo firmly that none of the powers or machinations formed againſt them have been able to pluck them up; <hi>but the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew.</hi> As is ſaid of the ruſh and the flag that flouriſh in mire and water, ſo it may be ſaid of them in many reſpects; they grew in the mire of foul oppreſſion, and in the waters of deep affliction; and have ſent out their roots and branches far and wide. Particularly,</p>
            <p>They grew under their afflictions, in the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian graces and virtues of patience, ſubmiſſion, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, courage and true fortitude, praying alſo with all manner of prayer, ſupplication and interceſſion with thankſgiving; and the more they were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted the more they abounded in praying and humbling themſelves before GOD; nor were they unſucceſsful in their addreſſes unto him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:015256_0019_0F98833439E71308"/>Several churches, in the ſpace of a few years, ſprang from this. And, their faith, charity and hopeful proſpects reſounding to England, many of the good people there, moved by the ſpirit of GOD, and the deſire of chriſtian liberty, came over to this land in great numbers a few years after.</p>
            <p>In the year 1628 the ſettlement of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts colony began, where, in about twenty four years, no leſs than <hi>twenty two</hi> churches were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and ſettled with paſtors. And in the whole of New-England, at this period of time, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of churches amounted to <hi>forty three.</hi> This was their religious and eccleſiaſtical growth.</p>
            <p>About the year 1643, emigrations from abroad were ſo nearly at an end, that it is ſuppoſed, as many or more went from us than came to us. At this date of time, the number of ſouls in this, and the ſiſter colonies of New-England were computed to be <hi>fifteen thouſand.</hi> And in the ſpace of nine years after, which brings us to 1652, they roſe to <hi>twenty one thouſand two hundred.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">As Mr. <hi>Johnſton</hi> tells us in his <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the ſettlement of Maſſachuſetts Colony, entitled <hi>Wonder-working Providence of Zion's King.</hi>
               </note> And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the public cenſus taken in 1755, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber amounted to <hi>four hundred thirty ſix thouſand nine hundred and thirty ſix</hi> ſouls. Add twenty one years to the above date, which brings us to the preſent time, and upon a moderate computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we ſhall fall but little if any ſhort of <hi>eight hundred thouſand,</hi> which ſuppoſeth not leſs than <hi>one hundred thouſand</hi> fighting men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:015256_0020_0F988334F9F061D8"/>This rapid increaſe, through the good hand of our GOD upon us, began and proceeded under a multiformity of afflictions and oppreſſions, both from our natural and unnatural enemies. And may we not truly ſay, that, under GOD, this ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing growth took its riſe from the virtue, cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and ſucceſs of the firſt adventurers who ſettled in this place? If this is the caſe, as we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably think it is, with what holy admiration and gratitude, may we ſuppoſe, the perfected ſpirits of our pious anceſtors now in heaven, to look down and behold the increaſe of the Redeemer's kingdom, and the flouriſhing of this country, as owing, in a great meaſure, to their own ſmall beginnings.</p>
            <p>It is probable the other Engliſh colonies (which, with theſe of New-England, do now compoſe the united States of America) multiplied and grew in proportion as theſe have done. If ſo, we have good reaſon to ſuppoſe the whole number of ſouls in theſe united States to be not leſs, but rather more than <hi>three millions.</hi> How amazingly hath this country <hi>multiplied and grew</hi> in the ſpace of 156 years.</p>
            <p>Indeed, we are under a thick cloud of darkneſs at preſent, but not in deſpair of light ſhining upon us, by and by, with increaſing luſtre. Our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, provoked with our numerous and aggravated offences, hath viſited us with the ſore and terrible judgment of war, from a quarter we little expected twenty years ago. He hath ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Great Britain, once our friends, to become

our foes, and make war upon us without any ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſe that we know of, unleſs it be their own exorbitant pride and avarice. What more could they reaſonably aſk or deſire of us then they uſed to have? They had the regulation and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the trade of the whole country—their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch had a negative upon all our laws; and, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on conſtitutional requiſition, our lives and fortunes were devoted to his ſervice and ſupport. What could he, or his parliament have more, unleſs it were the abſolute, unconditional juriſdiction of our properties, liberties and lives? The ſurrender of theſe is what they demand, and becauſe we think it an unreaſonable demand we are extremely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to comply with it; nor do we, nor ſhall we, if we can poſſibly help it. And what is the conſequence? why, they make a general deſcent upon us with their mighty power, and in the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible forms of war and vengeance, to bring us at their feet or ſlay us with death. <hi>The ſword is theirs; the hand that permits it is GOD's:</hi> We adore, and bow ſubmiſſion to the perfect righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the latter, but the former we think to be unrighteous altogether. We own ourſelves oppreſſed and diſtreſſed on every ſide, but not yet in deſpair. Still we hope in our fore-fathers GOD, and he gives us a great deal of encouragement and occaſion, both from his word and providence, ſo to do. <hi>Hitherto the Lord hath helped us</hi>—in the midſt of wrath he hath remembered mercy; and ſhould we not acknowledge it with gratitude, it would be an addition to all the other crimes we are chargeable with.</p>

               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:015256_0022_0F98833680024220"/>How plain to be ſeen is the merciful influence of Providence in breathing a general ſpirit of union into, and through the thirteen colonies—in lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their councils and determinations into ſo wiſe a direction as they have taken—in diſpoſing and inclining the whole collective body to unite, again and again, in humbling themſelves before GOD and making confeſſions, prayers and ſupplications unto him; as alſo enabling them, under all the inexperience and diſadvantages they labour, to make ſo noble, reſolute and ſucceſsful a ſtand as hitherto they have done, againſt the united powers of Great Britain, aided by many thouſands of foreign mercenaries. Theſe things conſidered, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the juſtice of our cauſe, we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to think, unworthy as we are, that the providence of GOD is favourable to our cauſe and country.</p>
            <p>Let all Europe, and the whole world turn their eyes this way, and behold, and wonder to ſee theſe young <hi>American colonies</hi> ſet on fire at both ends and in the middle, and not conſumed. Not unto us or an arm of fleſh, but to the power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of almighty GOD the praiſe belongs that we are thus far ſuſtained in the fire of a flaming war. We are not only ſuſtained, but in ſome reſpects, we grow and increaſe in the things that belong to our political ſalvation. The more our adverſaries afflict and diſtreſs us with the ſword of war, the more we grow in military ſkill, ſtrength and all manner of accompliſhments and means of defence.

            <p>One great <hi>ſtep</hi> hath been taken toward our eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape and freedom;<note n="‡" place="bottom">Viz. a declaration of the independence of the thirteen united American States July 4, 1776.</note> the event of which, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not certainly foretell, tho' we have good reaſon to think it will be favourable. The ſtep that is taken hath the appearance of a literal accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of one of thoſe ſcripture prophecies which (if it is to be underſtood in a literal ſenſe) muſt
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015256_0024_0F988337FB8503C8"/>
ſooner or later take place. There is a prophetic query in <hi>Iſa.</hi> lxvi.8.—<hi>Shall the earth be made to bring forth in one day, or ſhall a nation be born at once?</hi> If this paſſage is conſidered in a ſpiritual ſenſe, no doubt it hath reference to the ſpeedy, happy and extraordinary effects of the plentiful effuſion of the Holy Spirit. But is there any thing that makes againſt a more literal fulfilment? If not, it is a queſtion whether any thing has happened for theſe 1700 years paſt, that doth ſo literally and extenſively anſwer this query, as when theſe thirteen united States, by the voice of their deputies in Congreſs aſſembled, were led to declare themſelves free and independent of the juriſdiction of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and of all other powers on earth. By this act, we view theſe States as under no civil government, laws or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority but their own; and if they continue free and united, we may, with good propriety, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them in their united capacity as <hi>a nation born at once.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, we readily and religiouſly own that the eſtabliſhment and preſervation of this new-born nation depends intirely upon the good providence of GOD, in whom we hope and truſt for ſupport, protection and deliverance out of all our afflictions.</p>
            <p>FROM what hath been ſaid on the ſubject we are led to conclude, that the LORD will appear to vindicate the juſt cauſe of his afflicted people, and ſooner or later, turn his hand againſt their oppreſſors. Though for their high crimes and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015256_0025_0F988338BA249908"/>
offences againſt him, he may ſuffer the enemies of his people to oppreſs and diſtreſs them to a great degree; nevertheleſs, when he ſees them ſufficiently humbled for their ſins, and hears them cry unto him for deliverance therefrom, and from the oppreſſing hand of their enemies, he will ariſe for their help and come to their reſcue. So he did for his people in ancient times; when they were near utterly laid waſte by their enemies and cried unto him.<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm lxxviii.65, 66.</note> 
               <hi>Then the Lord awaked as one out of ſleep, and like a mighty man that ſhouteth by reaſon of wine; he ſmote his enemies in the hinder part, he put them to perpetual reproach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence, it is a vain thing for the powers of earth to attempt the downfal or decreaſe of thoſe perſons or people whom the Lord is minded to build up and increaſe. The powers of earth may unite their <hi>forces</hi> and take <hi>council</hi> together, but the one ſhall be broken and the other turned into fooliſhneſs; for <hi>who is he that ſaith, and it cometh to paſs, when the Lord hath not commanded it?</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Lam. iii.37.</note> We may ſee, in the growth of the Iſraelites under the bondage, afflictions and taſk-maſters of Egypt, and in the ſettlement, increaſe and flouriſhing of this country, notwithſtanding all the oppoſitions, hazards and hardſhips they had to encounter, how eaſy a thing it is with GOD to fruſtrate the plans and purpoſes formed againſt the people he delights to favour.</p>
            <p>Therefore, in all diſputes and controverſies with our fellow men, it ſhould be our greateſt concern
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:015256_0026_0F9883397ADA8F10"/>
to have <hi>the Lord with us and for us.</hi> As a means to enjoy this greateſt of favours we ſhould have a care, and attend to the following rules, namely, That we do not offend him in word or deed, either by taking his name in vain, or doing a wicked thing.—That we are not aggreſſors in any quarrel that we may happen to fall into with men.—That our cauſe, relative to the diſpute, be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and good, and that our hearts are ſincere and upright with God.—That we repent of our paſt miſconduct, and at the ſame time apply to the blood of atonement for pardon and cleanſing; and that our behaviour towards God and man correſponds with the directions given in the holy ſcriptures. Thus conducting ourſelves, we have no reaſon to fear but the Lord will be on our ſide, and plead our cauſe with thoſe that riſe up againſt us.</p>
            <p>As for the bloody conteſt between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and theſe united States, it is our opinion, upon careful enquiry, that we are not aggreſſors in the quarrel. While we were yet in quiet, and no public complaint exhibited to diſturb us, our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries began to conceive miſchief againſt us—to impoſe heavy burdens upon us, and to rob us of our <hi>ſtipulated rights;</hi> and becauſe we declined ſubmiſſion to their arbitrary will in all caſes, they attempted, and are ſtill attempting to rob us of our <hi>natural rights</hi> too. We only prayed for peace, ſafety and the free enjoyment of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges included in our natural and ſtipulated rights, but could not have them. Can any impartial

judge, or unprejudiced eye, help ſeeing and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining in their own minds that our cauſe is good? Was our public conduct as good as our public cauſe, we ſhould have good reaſon to think the preſent war would ſoon iſſue in our favour. And, as things ſtand, we do not deſpair, but abound in hope. Tho' our ſins againſt heaven are many and aggravated, yet we have a ſpace and means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance continued to us by the patience and goodneſs of that GOD who is gracious and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful—ready to pardon and willing to forgive and ſave his penitent people, and ſet them free from the cruel hands of unprovoked oppreſſors.</p>
            <p>May the ſpirit of grace and ſupplication—of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and reformation be poured upon us from the fulneſs of him with whom is the reſidue of the ſpirit, to the effectual ſuppreſſion of all impiety and profaneneſs againſt God—of injuſtice, extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſelfiſhneſs and the reſt of the vices; and, may righteouſneſs, charity and benevolence, out of a pure heart and faith unfeigned revive, and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively prevail. Should this happy change take place among us, we are well aſſured that upon ſeeking the Lord he would be found of us; we might call upon him and he would anſwer us agreeably to his own direction and gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>call upon me in the day of trouble, I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver thee and thou ſhalt glorify me.</hi> Our fore-fathers often experienced the divine faithfulneſs in this regard; <hi>they cried unto him in their troubles, and he delivered them out of their diſtreſſeſ.</hi>

They ſuffered, laboured, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, faſted, fought, and <hi>endured hardneſs as good ſoldiers of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> We have entered into their labours, and for a long time been reaping the fruits of their eminent ſervices and ſufferings; and, ſhall we be ſo baſe, or any of us ſo lightly eſteem the rich inheritance and valuable privileges they left us as tamely and ſtupidly to give them up without trying, and exerting ourſelves in every ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table way to preſerve them?</p>
            <p>Rather let us imitate <hi>their</hi> noble example in times of adverſity; and, like them, the more we are afflicted by our adverſaries or chaſtened by the hand of Providence, the more let us pray, and humble ourſelves before GOD, and confeſs our ſins, and lament the wickedneſs of the times, and implore <hi>the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and reform our manners, and improve the means and advantages God hath put into our hands, in the beſt manner we poſſibly can, for the ſalvation of our ſouls, and our bodies, our lives, liberties, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty

and country. Theſe are objects worthy our attention; and, as they are all aſſaulted, either by our temporal or ſpiritual enemies, we are in duty bound to apply ourſelves, with all the ſkill and reſolution we have, to defend and ſave them. This let us do, relying on the power and grace of <hi>Him, whoſe is the greatneſs, and the majeſty, and the glory, and the victory,</hi> for aſſiſtance and ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Let us upon this day, in a grateful, decent, and virtuous manner, <hi>recognize the goodneſs of GOD to our fore-fathers through all their trials and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions,</hi> and take courage therefrom, to hope in the power and mercy of the ſame GOD, whoſe <hi>hand is not ſhortned that it cannot ſave.</hi> Let us not enquire, as miſers do, who will ſhew us earthly good, or, how ſhall we make the greateſt and beſt worldly advantage by the miſeries and diſtreſſes of the preſent times? But, how ſhall we do moſt for the honour of the glorious GOD—the ſalvation of our country, and the good of our fellow-men? To promote theſe great and worthy ends, let us chearfully and religiouſly devote our abilities, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes and lives, and be <hi>followers of them</hi> (our pious fore-fathers and other good chriſtians) <hi>who thro' faith and patience, and much tribulation, have entered into the kingdom of heaven.</hi>
