            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A Journal of the Siege and Surrender of <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isbourg,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>ON the 28th of <hi>May</hi> I had the good Fortune to meet Admiral <hi>Boſcawen</hi> with the fleet and troops coming out of the harbour of <hi>Halifax.</hi> Lieutenant-General <hi>Bragg</hi>'s regiment, from the Bay of Fundy, joined the fleet this Day.</p>
            <p>The 29th we had ſine weather; the ſhips kept well together; the whole conſiſted of 157 ſail. The Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin [which carried over General <hi>Amherſt</hi>] went very ſickly into <hi>Halifax.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 30th the wind blew hard in the Afternoon; the ſhips were greatly diſperſed.</p>
            <p>The 31ſt the wind ſometimes contrary, obliged us to tack, and it blew freſh.</p>
            <p>The 1ſt of <hi>June</hi> Capt. <hi>Rous,</hi> in the Sutherland, came from off the harbour of <hi>Louisbourg,</hi> and ſaid, two ſhips
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008076_0003_102FD10F679DE438"/>had got in the 30th; and that there were thirteen ſail in the harbour. We ſaw the entrance of <hi>Gabarous</hi> at night.</p>
            <p>The 2nd it was foggy in the morning; about twelve ſaw <hi>Louisbourg,</hi> and the ſhips in the harbour. The fleet, with about a third of the troops, anchored in <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous</hi> Bay; and this evening, with Brigadier-Generals <hi>Lawrence</hi> and <hi>Wolfe,</hi> I reconnoitred the ſhore as near as we could, and made a diſpoſition for landing in three places the next morning, in caſe the troops arrived.</p>
            <p>The enemy had a chain of poſts from <hi>Cape Noir</hi> to the <hi>Flat Point</hi> and irregulars from thence to the bottom of the bay; ſome works thrown up at the places which appeared practicable to land at, and ſome batteries.</p>
            <p>On the 3d, moſt of the tranſports came in this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, all was prepared for landing; but the ſurff on ſhore was ſo great, it was impoſſible to land. This day Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadier-General <hi>Whitmore</hi> arrived from <hi>Halifax,</hi> at which place I have left Colonel <hi>Monckton</hi> to command. As one bay was found to have leſs ſurff than the others, a diſpoſition was made to land the next morning in one place, inſtead of three.</p>
            <p>The 4th the wind and ſurff were ſo very high, that Admiral <hi>Boſcawen</hi> told me it was impracticable to land.</p>
            <p>The 5th a great ſwell and fog in the morning, and the Admiral declared it ſtill impracticable to land.</p>
            <p>The 6th an appearance of change of weather, in the morning early: I was reſolved to ſeize the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; the ſignal was made to prepare to land between five and ſix o'clock, and at eight all the men were in the boats: the fog came on again, and the ſwell increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008076_0004_102FD111D1821610"/>during the time the men were getting into the boats, and the Admiral again declared it impracticable to land. I ordered the troops on board their reſpective ſhips, firſt acquainting them with the reaſon for ſo doing.</p>
            <p>The 7th the weather bad in the morning; in the afternoon the ſwell rather decreaſed, and gave us great hopes of landing at day-break the next morning, for which orders were given; and <hi>Bragg</hi>'s regiment, who were in a number of ſloops, to ſail under convoy, by the mouth of the harbour, to <hi>Lorembec;</hi> ſending, at the ſame time, a proportion of artillery deſtin'd for the light houſe point, with orders to make all the ſhew they could of landing, but not to land till further orders, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to draw the enemy's attention on that ſide.</p>
            <p>From the 2nd to this time, the enemy has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforcing their poſts, adding to their works, cannonading and throwing ſhells at the ſhips, and making all the preparations they can to oppoſe our landing. Seven tranſports were now miſſing with troops on board, three of which came in at night. The Admiral gave all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary orders for the frigates to cover our landing.</p>
            <p>On the 8th the troops were aſſembled in the boats before break of day, in three diviſions; and Commodore <hi>'Durell</hi> having viewed the coaſt by order of the Admiral, and given me his opinion the troops might land, without danger from the ſurff, in the bay on our left, the <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington</hi> and <hi>Halifax</hi> ſnow began the fire on the left, followed by the <hi>Gramont, Diana,</hi> and <hi>Shannon</hi> Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates in the center, and the <hi>Sutherland</hi> and <hi>Squirrel</hi> upon the right. When the fire had continued about a quarter of an hour, the boats upon the left rowed into
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008076_0005_102FD1156236F4F8"/>the ſhore, under the command of Brigadier General <hi>Wolfe,</hi> whoſe detachment was compoſed of the four eldeſt companies of Grenadiers, followed by the Light Infantry (a corps of 550 men, choſen as markſmen from the different regiments; they ſerve as Irregulars, and are commanded by Major <hi>Scott,</hi> who was Major of Brigade) and the companies of Rangers, ſupported by the Highland Regiment, and thoſe by the eight remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing companies of Grenadiers.</p>
            <p>The diviſion on the right, under the command of Brigadier-General <hi>Whitmore,</hi> conſiſted of the Royal, <hi>Laſcelles, Monckton, Forbes, Anſtruther</hi> and <hi>Webb,</hi> and rowed to our right by the <hi>White Point,</hi> as if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to force a landing there.</p>
            <p>The center diviſion, under the command of Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier-general <hi>Lawrence,</hi> was formed of <hi>Amberſt's, Hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's, Otway's, Whitmore's, Lawrence's,</hi> and <hi>War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burton</hi>'s, and made at the ſame time, a ſhew of land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the Freſh Water Cove. This drew the enemy's attention to every part, and prevented their troops, poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed along the coaſt, from joining thoſe on their right.</p>
            <p>The enemy acted very wiſely; they did not throw away a ſhot till the boats were near in ſhore; and then directed the whole fire of their cannon and muſketry upon them. The ſurff was ſo great, that a place could hardly be found to get a boat on ſhore. Notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the fire of the enemy, and the violence of the ſurff, Brigadier Wolfe purſued his point, and landed juſt at the left of the Cove, took poſt, attacked the enemy, and forced them to retreat. Many boats overſet, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008076_0006_102FD116F0CB4D70"/>broke to pieces, and all the men jumped into the water to get on ſhore.</p>
            <p>So ſoon as the left diviſion was landed, the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments of the center rowed a proper time to the left, and followed; then the remainder of the centre diviſion, as faſt as the boats could fetch them from the ſhips; and the right diviſion followed the center in like manner.</p>
            <p>It took up a great deal of time to land the troops; the enemy's retreat, or rather flight, was through the rougheſt and worſt ground I ever ſaw; and the purſuit ended with a connonading from the Town, which was ſo far of uſe, that it pointed out how near I could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp to inveſt it; on which the regiments marched to their ground, and lay on their Arms. The wind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and we could not get any thing on ſhore.</p>
            <p>The loſs of his Majeſty's troops at landing is Capt. Baillie and Lieut. Cuthbert, of the Highland regiment; Lieut. Nicholſon, of mine, four ſerjeants, one corpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and 38 men killed, 21 were of my regiment, (the Grenadiers) of which 8 were ſhot, and the reſt drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in trying to get on ſhore.</p>
            <p>Five lieutenants, two ſerjeants, one corporal, and 51 men wounded; and of the five companies of ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, one enſign and three private men killed, one wounded and one miſſing.</p>
            <p>On the enemy's ſide, two captains of grenadiers, and two lieutenants, are priſoners; one officer killed, and an Indian chief: ſeveral men likewiſe killed, and I imagine, about 70 men taken priſoners: they were ſent on board as faſt as poſſible. By ſome of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008076_0007_102FD11955D41E98"/>I had intelligence, that M. St. Julien, colonel, commonded in the Cove: that there were five battalions in the town, namely, Bourgogne, Artois Royal, Marine, Cambiſe, and Volantaires Etrangers, with about 700 Canadians. The three firſt regiments wintered in Louiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg; Volontaires Etrangers, came there not long ſince with part of the Fleet, and Cambiſe the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we landed,</p>
            <p>We took from the enemy three 24 pounders, ſeven nine pounders, and ſeven ſix pounders, two mortars, and 14 ſwivels; all which were placed along the ſhore, to prevent our landing; with ammunition, tools, and ſtores of all kinds.</p>
            <p>The 9th lieutenant general Bragg's regiment retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in their ſloops to Lorembec. The weather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued extremely bad; the ſurff ſo great, that we could get only ſome of our tents on ſhore in the afternoon.</p>
            <p>The 10th the ſurff ſtill continued, and it was with great difficulty we got any thing on ſhore.</p>
            <p>The 11th the weather grew clear and better, and the light ſix pounders, which I ordered on ſhore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the troops, were now only landed, and ſome artillery ſtores with them.</p>
            <p>On the 12th, from intelligence I had received, that the enemy had deſtroyed the grand battery, and called in their out-poſts, I detached Brigadier Wolfe with 1200 men, four companies of grenadiers, three-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of rangers, and ſome light infantry, round the N. E. harbour to the light houſe point, with an intention to ſilence the iſland battery, and, at the ſame time, to deſtroy the ſhips in the harbour; ſending at the ſame time by ſea, the proportion of artillery tools,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:008076_0008_102FD11CF8221248"/>&amp;c. that had been ordered for this ſervice.</p>
            <p>I received this day a report from brigadier Wolfe, that he had taken poſſeſſion of the light houſe point, and all the poſts on that ſide the harbour, which the enemy had abandoned, leaving ſeveral cannon, which were rendered uſeleſs, tools, &amp;c. and a great quantity of fiſh at Lorembec. The weather continued extremely bad; but we got ſome tools on ſhore this night; ſo that on the 13th, we began to make a communication from the right to the left in the front of the camp, and I ordered three redoubts on the moſt advantageous ground in the front. A party of the enemy came out this day towards our camp, but were ſoon beat back by the light infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try before two piquets could well get up to their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. We worked at the three redoubts in front all night.</p>
            <p>The 14th the enemy cannonaded us a great part of the day. The ſurff ſtill continued ſo great, that it was with the greateſt difficulty we could land any thing. The fleet, under the command of Sir Charles Hardy, which appeared yeſterday for ſome time, was in the night blown off to ſea.</p>
            <p>The 15th I ſent four more mortars in a ſloop to the light-houſe, but we could not get any artillery landed on this ſhore. At night two deſerters from the Volon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taires Etrangers came in, and ſaid they had 5 killed, and 46 wounded, in the ſkirmiſh on the 13th.</p>
            <p>The 16th the firſt fine weather, we landed 12 days proviſions, and got many things on ſhore, but could not yet land any artillery.</p>
            <p>The 17th I got Colonel Baſtide [chief Engineer] on
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008076_0009_102FD11F66DEA348"/>horſeback, and with Colonel Williamſon and Major M'Kellar, we reconnoitred the whole ground as far as we could; and Colonel Baſtide was determined in his opinion of making approaches by the green hill, and confining the deſtruction of the ſhips in the harbour to the light-houſe point, and the batteries on that ſide. I added two eight inch mortars and three royals to the light-houſe batteries.</p>
            <p>The 18th we had fine weather. Some Indians took three of the tranſports men at the bottom of Gabarus Bay, who landed there contrary to orders. The road for the artillery was puſh'd on as faſt as poſſible. We got three 24 pounders on ſhore, though the ſurff was great the beginning of the Day.</p>
            <p>The 19th the batteries of the Light Houſe were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to have been open'd this night, but could not be got ready ſo ſoon. L'Echo, a French frigate of 32 Guns, was brought in to-day; had got out of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour the 13th at night, and was bound to Quebec: By her we have intelligence, that the Bizane got out the day we landed, and the Commette ſince our arrival off the harbour.</p>
            <p>The 20th the Iſland battery and ſhips fired at the batteries on the ſhore, who began their fire this laſt night. The enemy burnt an old ſhip at the bottom of the harbour.</p>
            <p>The 21ſt very bad weather, and the ſurff high. The enemy diſcovered us making the road for the artillery, and canonaded us; threw ſome ſhot into the left of the camp, but did not oblige me to decamp any part. An advanced redoute towards Green Hill was thrown up this night.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="unknown:008076_0010_102FD121471DEE10"/>
            <p>The 22d the bad weather continued; we were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed on the roads, and getting up a blockhouſe on the left, by the Miry Road, to ſecure the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the N. E. harbour and Light Houſe, and to hinder any parties from going into Town.</p>
            <p>The 23d the Admiral aſſured me there were above 100 boats loſt in landing the troops and proviſions. This day fine weather; and we have now on ſhore twelve 24 pounders, and ſix twelve pounders. The enemy fired a great deal from their ſhipping and Iſland Battery, and threw ſome ſhot into the left of the camp. Colonel <hi>Meſſervey</hi> and moſt of his carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters taken ill of the ſmall-pox, which is a very great loſs to the army. Gabions and facſcines are landed, and carried forward as faſt as poſſible, to make an epaulement to Green Hill. The batteries at the Light Houſe fire with ſucceſs againſt the Iſland Battery, and I hope will ſoon ſilence it.</p>
            <p>On the 24th the enemy fired on the Light Houſe batteries from the town and ſhipping; and on our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced redoubt, which was finiſhed; they fired from the town. Colonel <hi>Baſtide</hi> remained fixed in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of advancing by Green Hill. We had this day in the park of artillery thirteen 24 pounders, and ſeven 12 pounders.</p>
            <p>The 25th the cannonading continued night and day: in the evening the Iſland Battery was ſilenced; their own fire had helped to break down part of their works. Faſcines and gabions were forwarded to Green Hill as faſt as poſſible. All the men employed at work, and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008076_0011_102FD12620AC3A30"/>making the neceſſary communications. The enemy fired a good deal at our advanced redoute.</p>
            <p>The 26th a ſmall alarm on the left of a party that had advanced from the town, had got up to the Block Houſe, which was not quite finiſhed. They had with them a barrel of pitch to ſet it on fire: the guard on it was not ſufficient to oppoſe a large party; but a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment was ſent out ſo quick, that they were forced to retreat without effecting their deſign, though two of the men had been in the block houſe, and they were drove back into the Town very faſt. Three hundred pioneers ordered to Green Hill. Admiral <hi>Boſcawen</hi> landed 200 marines, and took the poſt at Kennington Cove, which is a great eaſe to the army. I deſired of the Admiral four 32 pounders, and two 24 pounders to leave at the Light Houſe, to keep the Iſland Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in ruin, that with a proper number of men intren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched there, Brigadier <hi>Wolfe,</hi> with his detachment, might be able to come round the harbour, bringing his artillery with him; and to try to deſtroy the ſhipping, to advance towards the weſt gate.</p>
            <p>The 27th one braſs 24 pounder was loſt in twelve fathom water, by ſlipping off the catamaran, as they were coming from the ſhip to land it. The cannon I aſked of the Admiral were landed this night at the Light Houſe.</p>
            <p>The 28th a great many popping ſhots and cannona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. As the poſt at Green Hill was covered, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan the road over the bog, and throwing up an epaule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Colonel <hi>Meſſervey</hi> and his ſon both died this day; and of his company of carpenters of 108 men,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008076_0012_102FD127B04A55D0"/>all but 16 in the ſmall-pox, who are nurſes to the ſick. This is particularly unlucky at this time.</p>
            <p>The 29th cannonading continued, the frigate fired conſtantly at the epaulement; we purſued working at the road, which coſt a great deal of labour: at night the enemy ſunk four ſhips in the harbour's mouth; <hi>Apollo,</hi> a two-decked one, <hi>La Fidelle</hi> of 36 guns, <hi>La Chevre,</hi> and <hi>la Biche,</hi> of 16 guns each, and they cut off moſt of their maſts. Remain in the harbour five of the line of battle, and a frigate of 36 guns.</p>
            <p>The 30th at night ſome firing at Kennington Cove: the marines thought they ſaw <hi>Indians:</hi> the firgate fired all night at the epaulement, as the men worked in the night time.</p>
            <p>The 1ſt of <hi>July</hi> the enemy creeped out in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to get ſome old palliſades and wood. Brigadier <hi>Wolfe</hi> and Major <hi>Scott</hi>'s Light Infantry puſhed them in with a very briſk fire; and the Brigadier took poſts on the hills, from whence it was intended to try to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſh the ſhipping; we marched forward on the right, forced the enemy back to Cape <hi>Noir</hi> with a ſmart fire.</p>
            <p>The 2nd the epaulement and road went on heavily, from the extreme badneſs of the ground: The enemy continued their cannonading, and threw ſome ſhells; we ſkirmiſhed all Day with parties out of the town.</p>
            <p>The 3d a great cannonading from the town and ſhipping, on the batteries. Brigadier <hi>Wolfe</hi> was mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an advanced work on the right, thrown up 650 yards from the cover'd way, with an intention of erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a battery to deſtroy the defences of the place, it being pretty well on the capital of the citadel baſtion;
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008076_0013_102FD1296FEA3470"/>and the falling of the ground from this place, towards the works, would hinder diſcovering as much of the works as would be neceſſary to do them any damage. In the evening the ſea officers thought ſome of the ſhips would try to get out of the harbour. The bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries on the left immediately play'd on them, but it grew ſo dark they could not continue.</p>
            <p>The 4th a great fog; when there were glares of light, the cannonading began; 500 men kept conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually making faſcines.</p>
            <p>The 5th very bad weather; the epaulement was haſtened on as much as poſſible; it ſwallowed up an immenſe number of faſcines, coſt ſome men, as the frigate cannonaded on it without ceaſing.</p>
            <p>The 6th a ſloop ſailed out of the harbour with a flag of truce to Sir <hi>Charles Hardy,</hi> to carry ſome things to their wounded officers and priſoners.</p>
            <p>The many difficulties of landing everything in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a continual ſurff, the making of roads, drawing &amp; paſſing of bogs, and putting ourſelves under cover ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our approach to the place much longer than I could wiſh.</p>
            <p>On the 7th we had very foggy weather; cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ading continued all day, and a good deal of popping ſhots from the advanced poſts.</p>
            <p>The 8th I intended an attack on ſome advanced poſts at <hi>Cape-Noir,</hi> but it did not take place. Colonel <hi>Baſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ide</hi> got a contuſion by a muſket ball on his boot, which laid him up in the gout.</p>
            <p>The 9th, in the night, the enemy made a ſally where Brigadier <hi>Lawrence</hi> commanded; they came from <hi>Cape Noir,</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:008076_0014_102FD12C5D270340"/>and tho' drunk, I am afraid rather ſurprized a company of grenadiers of <hi>Forbes</hi>'s, commanded by Lord <hi>'Dundonald,</hi> who were poſted in a fleecke, on the right, Major <hi>Murry,</hi> who commanded three companies of gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadiers, immediately detached one, and drove the enemy back very eaſily. <hi>Whitmore</hi>'s and <hi>Bragg</hi>'s grenadiers behaved very well on this occaſion. Lord <hi>Dundonald</hi> was killed. Lieut. <hi>Tew</hi> wounded and taken priſoner, Capt. <hi>Bontein,</hi> of the engineers, taken priſoner: 1 cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, 3 men killed; 12 miſſing; 17 men woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The ſally was of five picquets, ſupported by 600 men; a captain, <hi>Chevalier de Chavelin,</hi> was killed; a lieutenant wounded and taken priſoner; 17 men killed; 4 wounded, and bro't off priſoners; beſides what woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they carried into the town: one of which, a captain, died immediately. The enemy ſent out a flag of truce to bury their dead, which when over, the cannonading be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan again. The frigate was ſo hurt, ſhe hauled cloſe to the town; the ſhips fired very much againſt Brigadier <hi>Wolfe's</hi> batteries.</p>
            <p>The 10th the road at the epaulement went on a little better; the enemy fired a great deal, and threw many ſhells.</p>
            <p>The 11th a waggoner was taken off by ſome Indians, between the block-houſe and the left of the north-eaſt harbour.</p>
            <p>The 12th it rained very hard all night; not a man in the detachment could have a dry thread on; we made an advanced work to Green-Hill; at night the waggoner who had been taken, luckily made his eſcape; ſaid, they were 250 Canadians. The citadel baſtion fired very ſmartly.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="unknown:008076_0015_102FD12F384B6468"/>
            <p>The 13th the enemy threw a great many ſhells; we perfected our works as faſt as we could; had rainy wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the enemy was at work at <hi>Cape Noir,</hi> to hinder our taking poſſeſſion near that point, which is of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; ſome deſerters came in ſaid a ſloop from <hi>Miray,</hi> got in three days ago.</p>
            <p>The 14th, the batteries were traced out laſt night with an intention to place twenty 24-pounders, divided in four different batteries, to deſtroy the defences: and a battery of 7 mortars, with ſome twelve-pounders, to ricohet the works and the town.</p>
            <p>The 15th the cannonading and firing continued; the enemy tried to throw ſome ſhells into camp, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be intended againſt our powder magazines: At ten at night the light-houſe battery fired ſome rockets as a ſignal of ſhips ſailing out of the harbour; Sir Charles Hardy anſwered it; the frigate got out, and Sir Charles Hardy's Fleet got under ſail and went to ſea. Before day-break, Capt. Sutherland, poſted at the end of the north-eaſt harbour, was attacked, and there was a great deal of firing; the grenadiers of Brigadier Wolfe's corps marched to ſuſtain him, and all the light infantry; it was over before they could get up, and, by a diſerter from the enemy, they were only 100 men come from <hi>Miray,</hi> where they left Monſ. <hi>de Boisbiere,</hi> who had, on the other ſide of the water, 300 men, with boats to paſs. Major <hi>Scott,</hi> with the light infantry, purſued, but could not get up with them. I encamped a corps forward.</p>
            <p>The 16th, towards night, Brigadier <hi>Wolfe</hi> puſhed on a corps and took poſſeſſion of the hills in the front
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008076_0016_102FD134738B7EE0"/>of the baraſoy, where we made a lodgment; the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my fired very briſkly from the town and ſhipping.</p>
            <p>The 17th a great fire continued from the town and ſhipping; we reſolved to extend the parallel from the right to the left. The fleet returned.</p>
            <p>The 18th, all laſt night the enemy fired muſketry from the covert-way, and tried to throw ſhells into the camp.</p>
            <p>The 19th I relieved the trenches by battalions, the 14 battalions formed 3 brigades; a ſmart fire from the covert-way; the batteries on the left fired againſt the baſtion Dauphine with great ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>The 21ſt one of the ſhips in the harbour had ſome powder blown up in her, made a great exploſion, and ſet the ſhip on fire, which ſoon caught the ſails of two more; they burned very faſt, and we kept firing on them the whole time, to try to hinder the boats and people from the town, to get to their aſſiſtance; the Entreprenant, Capricieux, and Superb, were the three burned ſhips; the Prudent and Bienfaiſant remained.</p>
            <p>The 22d two batteries on the right opened with 13 24-pounders, and another with 7 mortars, and fired with great ſucceſs; the enemy fired very well from the town for ſome time, and threw their ſhells into our works. Our ſhells put the citadel in flames. I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Col. <hi>Williamſon</hi> to confine his fire as much as he could to the defences of the place, that we might not deſtroy the houſes. A lieutenant of the Royal-Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, going his rounds on an advanced poſt, loſt his way, and was taken priſoner near Cape Noir. A battery was begun on the left for four 24-pounders.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="unknown:008076_0017_102FD136058C4DA8"/>
            <p>The 23d the cahorns were uſed at night and the French mortars ſent to throw ſtones from the trenches. The enemy fired all ſorts of old iron, and any ſtuff they could pick up. Col. <hi>Baſtide</hi> was out to-day for the firſt time ſince he received the contuſion. Our batteries fired with great ſucceſs. This night the ſhells ſet fire to the barracks, and they burnt with great violence.</p>
            <p>On the 24th the fire was very briſk on our ſide, and the enemy's decreaſed. The admiral gave me 400 ſeamen to help work at the batteries, and 200 miners added to a corps of 100 already eſtabliſhed, that we might make quick work of it, and they were imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately employed. The 4 gun battery opened, and another of 5 erecting. One of the men of war in the harbour, the Bienfaiſant, fired at our trenches at high water, and the citadel and baſtion Dauphine fired againſt the 4 gun battery; but our men firing ſmall-arms into the embrazures, beat the enemy off their guns.</p>
            <p>The 25th the batteries fired with great ſucceſs. The admiral ſent me word, he intended to ſend in boats with 600 men, to take or deſtroy the Prudente and Bienfaiſant, in the harbour. I ordered all the batteries at night to fire into the works as much as poſſible, to keep the enemy's attention to the land. The miners and workmen went on very well with their approaches to the covered way, tho' they had a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued and very ſmart fire from it, and grape ſhot, and all ſorts of old iron from the guns of the ramparts. We continued our fire without ceaſing, and a ricochet: The boats got to the ſhips at one in the morning, and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008076_0018_102FD1379C6AB438"/>took them both: They were obliged to burn the Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dente, as ſhe was a-ground; and they towed off the Bienfaiſant to the north-eaſt harbour.</p>
            <p>The 26th the admiral came on ſhore, and told me he propoſed ſending 6 ſhips into the harbour the next day. Juſt at this time I received a letter from the governor, offering to capitulate, and the articles were agreed upon. The troops remained in the trenches this night as uſual.</p>
            <p>The 27th three companies of grenadiers, under the command of Major <hi>Farquhar,</hi> took poſſeſſion of the weſt gate; and I ſent in brigadier general <hi>Whitmore,</hi> to ſee the garriſon lay down their arms, and poſt the neceſſary guards in the town, on the ſtores, magazines, &amp;c. And I had the arms bro't out of town, and 11 colours, which I ſend you, under the care of Captain <hi>William Amherſt.</hi> As I have given in orders that I deſired every commanding officer of corps would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the officers and men that I was greatly pleaſed with the brave and good behaviour of the troops, which has, and always muſt inſure ſucceſs; I am to acquaint you, Sir, that I took the liberty to add to it, that I would report it to the King.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I Will not trouble you with a particular detail of the landing and ſiege, but cannot help mentioning a particular gallant action in the night between the 25th and 26th inſtant: The boats of the ſquadron were in two diviſions detached under the command of captains <hi>Laforey</hi> and <hi>Balfour,</hi> to endeavour either to take or burn the Prudente of 74 guns, and the Bienfaiſant of 64, the only remaining French ſhips in the harbour; in which they ſucceeded ſo well, as to burn the former, ſhe being a-ground, and take the latter, and tow her into the N. E. harbour, notwithſtanding they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the fire of the cannon and muſketry of the iſland battery, point Rochefort, and the town, being favoured with a dark night. Our loſs was inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, 7 men killed and 9 wounded.</p>
               <p>I have given the command of the Bienfaiſant to Captain <hi>Balfour,</hi> and the Echo, a frigate to Captain <hi>Laforey;</hi> Mr. <hi>Affleck,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bickerton,</hi> lieutenants, who boarded the Bienfaiſant, ſucceed thoſe gentlemen in the Aetna fire-ſhip, and Hunter ſloop.</p>
               <p>I have only farther to aſſure his Maieſty, that all his troops and officers, both ſea and land, have ſupported the fatigue of this ſiege with great firmneſs and alacrity.</p>
