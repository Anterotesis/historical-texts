            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TO mark with accuracy and precision, the principles from which the great and important transactions on the theatre of the political world originate, is an indespensable duty, not only of legislators, but of every subject of a free State; fraught with the most instructive lessons on the passions that actuate the human breast, the inquiry is amply adapted to the purpose of regulating the social concerns of life.</p>
            <p>THE laws and penalties by which subjects are compelled to promote the general interests of a community, should ever be instituted with a special reference to these principles, and the greatest perfection of human government consists in the judicious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of this application.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:018292_0005_0FA5C6B300CDA870"/>THE constitution or frame of government in a republican State, is circumscribed by Barriers, which the ambitious or designing cannot easily remove, without giving the alarm to those whose priviledges might be infringed by the innovation; but that the principle of administration may be grossly corrupted, that the people may be abused, and enslaved under the best of constitutions, is a truth to which the annals of the world may be adduced to bear a melancholy attestation.</p>
            <p>So silently have the advances of arbitary power been made. that a community has often been upon the verge of misery and servitude, whilst all was calm and tranquil in the State.</p>
            <p>To revert to first principles is so essentially requsite to public happiness and safety, that Polybius has laid it down as an incontrovertible axiom, that every State must decline more or less rapidly, in proportion as she recedes from the principles on which she was founded. <note n="*" place="bottom">Polyb. Hist. Lib. 6 P. 618.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THAT virtue is the true principle of republican governments <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>Aristotle thinks there is not any one virtue belonging to the subjects of a despotic government.</p>
                  <bibl>Polit. Lib. 1.</bibl>
               </note> has been sufficiently proved by the ablest writers on the subject, and, that whereas other forms of government may be supported without her, yet that in this she is absolutely necessary to their existence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:018292_0006_0FA5C6B3ABEEA0B8"/>A GENERAL prevalence of that love for our country which teaches us to esteem it glorious to die in her defence, is the only means of perpetuating the enjoyment of that liberty and security, for the support of which all government was originally intended.</p>
            <p>LAWS and punishments are but the ensigns of human depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, to render them as few as the public safety will admit, is the study of every wise, humane legislature. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>
                     <p>A multiplicity of rigorous penal laws is not only incompatible with the liberty of a free state, but even repugnant to human nature.</p>
                     <bibl>Montesquieu.</bibl>
                  </q>
               </note> The happy influences of this noble passion, by precluding the necessity of a multiplicity of Laws will free a People from those spectacles of misery and horror, which the penalties annexed to the breach of them must inevitably create.</p>
            <p>THE contempt of dangers, and of death, when liberty was the purchase, has been the means of elevating to the highest pitch of glory, those famed Republics of antiquity, which later ages have considered as the models of political perfection; instructed from early infancy to deem themselves the property of the State, they were ever ready to sacrifice their concerns to her interests;
"dear to us (says the eloquent Cicero) dear to us are our Parents, dear are our Children, our Neighbours and Associates, but above all things, dear is our Country <note n="†" place="bottom">Cicero de Offic.</note>;"
the Injuries that are done to an individual are limited, those to a community may involve millions in destruction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:018292_0007_0FA5C6B482AD8818"/>
"IT is impossible not to love a patriot, it is only loving him who loves us, <note n="*" place="bottom">Gordon's Sallust. P. 41.</note>
—it is impossible not to be charmed with the influences of those divine sentiments, which induced the brave Decii to devote themselves to certain Death, that they might ensure the Roman armies victory and glory.</p>
            <p>THE celebrated story of the two Carthaginian brethren, who consented to be buried alive, to increase the boundaries of their Country, shews us to what an enthusiastic height this virtue may be carried.</p>
            <p>AMONGST the Spartans, to return from the field of battle <hi>with</hi> or <hi>upon</hi> their shields, was equally glorious, and subject of joy and acclamation; to escape without them, an indelible mark of infamy and disgrace.</p>
            <p>FROM <hi>public spirit</hi> proceeds almost every other virtue. The man who willingly would die to save his Country, would surely sacrifice his fortune and possessions, to secure her peace and happiness. The noble examples of frugality which were exhibited in the conduct of the Spartan governors, who began the reformation of the state, by delivering up their own private property, to convince the citizens that their intentions were sincere, is a proof how much it may be made to triumph over avarice and selfishness.</p>

               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:018292_0008_0FA5C6B5291F4090"/>THE Thebans, under the matchless Epaminondas, when they were deserted by their allies, and reduced to the greatest extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, were by the wise example of their general, and frequent skirmishes with the enemy, inspired with a spirit of enterprize and bravery, which at length enabled them to vanquish thrice their number of Lacedemonian troops, and having slain their general, to march in hostile array to the very gates of Sparta.</p>
            <p>THESE are the principles which have more or less animated the subjects of every state, that has arrived to any considerable degree of opulence and grandeur, and it is of the greatest use to observe how others have gradually crept into governments, and suppressed, or eradicated the public virtue of a people.</p>
            <p>ALAS! to what amounts the summit of all human greatness! Sparta, the nurse of heroes and legislators, Athens, the seat of arts and sciences, Carthage the mart of all the trading nations, and even Rome, the haughty mistress of the world, have all long since been level'd with the dust! of all the states and cities of the globe that have experienced the like catastrophe, scarce can we mention one that has not met her ruin, in a forgetfulness of those <hi>fundamental principles</hi> on which her happiness depended.</p>
            <p>So nearly is the most prosperous condition of a people, allied to decay and ruin, that even this flattering appearance

            <p>THE Carthaginians, says Montague, <note n="†" place="bottom">On Republics, P. 339.</note> stand single upon the records of history, the only people in the universe upon whom immense wealth has never been able to work its usual effects; but even in this instance it may perhaps reasonably be questioned, whether the factions that prevented the illustrious Hannibal from entering the gates of Rome, whilst he had filled that city with terror and dismay, were not the effect of opulence, and loss of public virtue. The introduction of wealth in the Roman republic, is dated at the conquest of Antiochus the great, and the aera of corruption from the same memorable period; what sluices of depravity and misery did they not open in the state! That senate which once resembled an assembly of Kings, whose rigid faith had rendered them the objects of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal veneration whilst frugality and patriotism were held in estima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, can <hi>now</hi> meanly stoop to avail themselves of a quibble in the terms of a treaty, to destroy a City they had pledged their

            <p>THE unparalled usurpations of Sylla, Marius, and Caesar are but variegated forms, in which are exhibited, the baneful effects of that adulatory submission, with which a base, degenerate, and corrupted people have become the instruments of tyranny and murder; the bloody proscriptions and licensed executions of those pests of the human race, which have disgraced the Roman name, were generally accompanied with the thanks of the Senate. Jugurtha, that infamous Numidian Prince, who ungratefully murdered the children of his benafactor, in this corrupted age of the Republic, secures himself from the punishment due to his crimes by bribing his Judges, and by the same means enables himself to enter the Roman camp, and make that army whose force he once had dreaded, submit to <hi>pass the yoke,</hi> the most ignominious punishment that could have been inflicted.</p>

Agis, the brave reformer of the Spartan manners, was condemned by the tyrant who owed his life to <hi>him,</hi> to die an ignominious death for an unsuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful opposition to the torrent of vice which had overwhelmed that republic; a fond and anxious mother presented at the door of his prison, a petition, that her son might be indulged with a hearing before the people; the unfeeling minister of cruelty had already perpetrated the execrable deed, and sneeringly replied, no farther injury should be done him; he then intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced her to the apartment where laid the body of her murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed son, with that of her aged mother who had attended her; sensible that his misfortunes were the consequence of lenity car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a degree that rendered it impolicy, she could not forbear kissing the bloody corpse, and uttering aloud the sentiments of her soul; in the midst of this affecting scene, that would have extorted pity from a savage breast, the ruffian, exasperated at these effusions of grief, as expressing her justification of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, rushed on the distracted <hi>mother,</hi> and plunged his dagger in her breast!</p>

You who have seen the helpless victim of a merciless disease, groaning under the agonies of a relentless fever, can tell what epithets to use in the description of the tortures they endured; their tongues were parched with raging heat! Their boiling blood scalded the very veins in which it circulated—and did ye then, ye ministers of wrath, supply a single cup of water to refresh their thirsty souls? Verily, ye unworthy offspring of a <hi>christian</hi> land, <hi>inasmuch as ye did it not to one of these,</hi> ye did it not to <hi>him</hi> who shortly will avenge the cause of <hi>innocence.</hi>
