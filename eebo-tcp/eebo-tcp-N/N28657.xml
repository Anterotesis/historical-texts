            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AMIDST the viciſſitudes of time there are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent occurrences, which impreſs the tender feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of affection, and open the ſprings of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the human heart. At ſuch ſeaſons, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent tokens and expreſſions of mourning become a matter of duty, dictated both from principles of humanity and piety: and to mingle our tears in ſocial ſympathy and condolence, gives a kind of eaſe to the painful ſenſations of grief.</p>
            <p>SUCH events, alſo, in the courſe of divine providence, ſometimes ariſe, as deeply impreſs the public mind, and ſpread a ſcene of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over a whole nation, to which, the words of the text will ſtrictly apply, and it may be truly ſaid, that all the country weeps with a loud voice. I think, I am not miſtaken in ſaying, that ſuch a ſcene of mourning is now ſpread over the land, to which we are adding our ſmall trib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ute
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038201_0004_101151A7B18CEBD8"/>
of grief, mingling our tears with thoſe of the public. The ſolemnities of the day, with the gloomy tokens of death in our view, keep freſh in all our minds, a painful ſenſe of that ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful event, that excites the public grief; and mentioning of it, will but increaſe the ſorrow. It is the death of General WASHINGTON, that has raiſed the loud voice of weeping through the American States. And the death of ſuch an illuſtrious perſonage, the firſt and moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed general and ſtateſman of his country, and the age; ſuch a diſintereſted patriot, ſuch a defender, deliverer and father of his country, muſt needs be deeply lamented in every heart, that is not totally void of all ſenſibility, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and piety.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE, to direct and aſſiſt us in the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſolemnities and duties, that we may mourn as chriſtians, and as the free and federal citizens of America ought to mourn; I would obſerve, that our mourning ſhould be accompanied with ſentiments of piety; of ingenuous gratitude; of profound reſpect and reverence, to the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of the deceaſed; and alſo with devout and ſervent prayer to GOD.</p>
            <p>THIS arrangement of the ſubject, will naturally direct to a devout acknowledgment of the hand of divine providence, in forming the inſtruments,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038201_0005_101151AA78893C70"/>
and directing the meaſures that effected the ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ereignty, the independency, the liberty and the increaſing proſperity of our country; and at the ſame time excite a grateful recollection of the patriotic ſervices, the unrivalled virtues and merits, and heroic achievements of our great leader in war and in peace, and inſpire a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reſpect and reverence to his memory; and alſo mind us of our duty, to pray without ceaſing to GOD, that the example, the patriotiſm, the parental advice and counſels, of ſo illuſtrious a perſon, may have a happy influence, upon all orders and ranks of men in the land, from gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration to generation, till time ſhall be no more.</p>
            <p>THE period having arrived in the courſe of providence, when we ſhould be freed from a foreign yoke, and our great revolution com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence; as the foundation of nations, through human depravity, is generally laid in blood, and the ſceptre obtained by the ſword, that GOD who formed Moſes to be the deliverer of his people, from their bondage in Egypt, that GOD who taught the hands of David to war, and his fingers to fight, who girded Cyrus with his might, that GOD, formed, endowed and aſſiſted <hi>GEORGE WASHINGTON,</hi> a native of Virginia, to be the deliverer of his country, and perform won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which aſtoniſh the world. As he was the gift of heaven to his country, the ſame unerring
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038201_0006_101151AD03753160"/>
wiſdom and goodneſs of GOD that gave, has now taken away, therefore, ſentiments of profound ſilent ſubmiſſion to the divine will, highly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come us as Chriſtians. We are not to murmur or complain, but are allowed to mourn, in the exerciſe of pious reſignation.</p>
            <p>FURTHER to direct and aſſiſt our mourning, we muſt by no means, omit a ſincere thankful recollection of the many, the very many great and unparalleled ſervices this illuſtrious bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor performed for his country, the memory of which, it is hoped, that time will never obliterate.</p>
            <p>HAVING in early life exhibited ſtriking marks of ſuperior military addreſs and talents in ſome memorable inſtances, he was appointed by the united voice of his country, to the ſupreme command of the American army, at a time, when the defence of our lives, rights and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and every thing dear and ſacred to us, made it abſolutely neceſſary for our country to appeal to arms. In this elevated character, as general of the armies of his country, he ſhone brighter and brighter, like the riſing ſun, until he had conquered his powerful enemies, and completely freed his country. And the many evidences of his profound knowledge in the ſcience of arms; the repeated diſplays of moſt
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038201_0007_101151AE893869A0"/>
ſuperior martial endowments; his intrepid firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and magnanimity of mind; the many tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of his victories; the powerful European armies, and the many dignified, boaſting Britiſh generals he conquered and ſubdued, one after another, have fixed in his character, the indelible marks of one of the greateſt warriors and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals of the world.</p>
            <p>AND further, to increaſe our ſenſe of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of gratitude we are all under to this great man, let us, for a moment, think what had been our fate, and that of our country, ſuppoſing the ſcene had been reverſed, and victory had declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our enemy. In this caſe, there is no doubt at all, from what experience had taught us, and from what ſome of us had ſeen and heard; and from the well known habits and cuſtoms of the cruel tyrants of Europe, that as ſhocking a ſcene of hanging and gibbeting had been opened through the land, as ever was known in the world. And thoſe that eſcaped with their lives, with their poſterity after them, would have been abject ſlaves to a foreign power. Conſidering this, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting to our preſent enjoyments and proſpects, and the name of <hi>WASHINGTON</hi> muſt excite the warmeſt ſenſe of gratitude in the heart of every citizen of America.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:038201_0008_101151B10C924AD0"/>
THERE is another well known fact, which I cannot omit mentioning on this occaſion, as a moſt convincing evidence of the ſuperior addreſs, patriotiſm and integrity of this great man; I mean the manner of his retiring from the ſcene of war, and diſbanding his army, when he had delivered his country. With a powerful, well diſciplined army, moſt warmly attached to his perſon, and the military force of his country at his command, under every advantage to aſſume the government, under any of thoſe dignified names of king, emperor, protector, &amp;c. which have been ſo infatuating to the human mind in all ages of the world; (to which it was then ſaid he was warmly ſolicited by many) he diſbanded his army in the greateſt tranquillity; giving them the moſt wiſe and paternal counſel and advice; and affectionately recommending of them to the government of their ſeveral ſtates, for a juſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of their great and eminent ſervices; reſigned his command, and retired to his home in the character <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>. This, by all that knew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, will be conſidered as the moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> evidence of the great integrity of his heart. Perhaps there is not another man in the world, in that ſituation, that could, or would, have done the ſame.</p>
            <p>LET us now, under the impreſſions both of grief and gratitude, follow our great leader, from the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038201_0009_101151B39A4D5E30"/>
ſcene of war, the field of victory, to the chair of ſtate as the firſt ſupreme magiſtrate and Preſident of the Union, to which he was called by the unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed voice of his country. His ſervices in this ſtation of eminence, have a laſting claim upon the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of this and future generations; and the evidences of ſuperior political knowledge, and talents, for government, founded on a ſeries of public facts, will tranſmit his memory to poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as the firſt and greateſt of magiſtrates. For though we heartily wiſh and pray his ſucceſſors may imitate his many excellences and virtues, we do not expect they will equal the great origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. The general tranquillity, the marks of increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wealth and proſperity conſpicuous in every city and village throughout the United States; the entire confidence and unfeigned affection of his country, muſt forever evince the ſuperiority of his talents and wiſdom as firſt magiſtrate: and, when to theſe conſiderations, we recollect, that his generous patriotic ſoul led him to decline re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any ſalary or compenſation for his ſervices, both as General of the Armies, and as Preſident of the Union, it ſeems that a grateful remembrance of him could never be loſt, and ought to be cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed in our breaſts, under the deepeſt ſenſations of grief.</p>
            <p>THESE imperfect hints (for I poſſeſs neither ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials nor abilities to do juſtice to the ſubject)
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:038201_0010_101151B719B57B60"/>
I ſay, what has been but very imperfectly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, muſt impreſs our minds with profound re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect and reverence to the memory of the deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He has certainly merited it of his country; and ſentiments of this kind ought to accompany our mourning. It is ſcarcely ſuppoſable that the citizens of America, will ever loſe a veneration for the name and memory of <hi>WASHINGTON.</hi> I do not recollect ever hearing of a ſingle inſtance of miſtake, error, or blame, that was ever juſtly charged upon him; nor did I ever read of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in any age of the world, to whom, ſuch real greatneſs and purity of character, would more juſtly apply; or that ever merited more highly of this country.</p>
            <p>AFTER a ſeries of the moſt eminent ſervices for his country, for the ſpace of five and forty years, enough to bear down the firmeſt conſtitution, he declined being conſidered as a candidate for the office of Preſident, and thought proper to retire to the private walks of life. But ſtill retaining his diſintereſted affection for his country, left it a legacy fraught with the moſt tender, parental advice, counſels, warnings and cautions, that human wiſdom could deviſe, which, ought to be engraven on the heart of every American citizen. As a further evidence of the ſingular greatneſs of his mind, upon retiring from ſuch elevated ſtations.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:038201_0011_101151B9ACD6E5A8"/>
But ſtill conſidered his life as devoted to his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's good, and upon the appearance of danger, once more accepted of the command of its army; but by a kind Providence never had an occaſion to be called to the field of battle.</p>
            <p>LET us now collect our thoughts, and prepare to follow this great man to his ſick and death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, bearing in our minds thoſe words of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, which bid us to "mark the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace." It appears from the public ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, that his laſt ſickneſs was ſudden and ſhort; and that he ſoon expected it would ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate as it did. But in the free and full uſe of his reaſon, he preſerved the ſame firmneſs and magnanimity of mind in facing his laſt enemy, death, which always attended him in meeting his enemies in the field; accompanied with his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſerenity of countenance, and ſupported, undoubtedly, by ſentiments of real piety. As a ſingular and affecting evidence of this, when he actually found the cold hand of death was laid upon him, and the breath of life was departing, with his own hand he ſupported his falling chin, and cloſed his own eyes.</p>
            <p>CAN we now wonder, my hearers, even from this very imperfect recollection of the life, the ſervices, the virtues, the merits and death, of this great and good Columbian Hero, Patriot and

Father. Can we, I ſay, wonder that all the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is now weeping with a loud voice? Could the ancient Jews, that ſtubborn and hard-hearted race, mourn for their Moſes, their Samuel and Joſiah? They certainly would riſe up in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt us and condemn us, if we did not manifeſt the deepeſt ſenſibility, at ſo great a loſs, ſo lamentable an event, as the death of ſuch a Friend, Benefactor, Defender, Deliverer, and Father of his Country. Wherefore,</p>
            <p>THAT we may not only mourn, but mourn as chriſtians ought to mourn, let our tears be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with fervent and unceaſing prayer to GOD, the great diſpoſer of events, and repairer of breaches, that a wiſe improvement may be made, by all orders of men, of an occurrence in his holy providence, ſo alarming, inſtructive and ſorrowful. For this great man, though now dead, is yet ſpeaking to his country, and ſpeaking aloud in the example he ſet, the eminent ſervices he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and eſpecially in the advice, counſels and cautions he ſends us, as it were, from his tomb; and in his death, he is ſtill more ſolemnly calling to us all, to be alſo ready.</p>
            <p>MAY his ſucceſſors in office, and all our magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates, imitate his example and virtues; and may a remembrance of his heroiſm inſpire the militia of our country through all generations, with the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:038201_0013_101151BDB8B420E8"/>
ſpirit and virtues that form the ſoldier. And will GOD, of his mercy, ſanctify theſe allotments of his Providence to the public good. Finally,</p>
            <p>THAT the citizens of the American Republic of this generation, may never be reproached, for the want of a proper diſcernment of the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and conduct of their magiſtrates and public ſervants; nor for the want of gratitude to their benefactors, and a decent reſpect and reverence to the perſons and memory of their patriots; I ſay, that we may never have reproaches of this kind, let the faithful hiſtorian of theſe times remember to record it, for the information of the world, and of all future generations: <hi>THAT AT THE DEATH OF GENERAL GEORGE WASHINGTON, "ALL THE COUNTRY WEPT WITH A LOUD VOICE."</hi>
