            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>2. SAMUEL, xii. 7. AND NATHAN SAID TO DAVID, THOU ART THE MAN.</head>
            <p>NEVER, perhaps, had one man a more ſolemn meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to deliver to another than Nathan had to David in this inſtance.</p>
            <p>Although David was a man after God's own heart, and divinely appointed king over his people Israel, yet, we may venture to aſſert, of none are ſuch ſhocking ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities left on ſacred record, as of him. This while it affords a warning for the righteous in every age, does not in the leaſt excuſe them, when found guilty.</p>
            <p>In the inſtance before us, David had moſt unlawfully taken the wife of Uriah, and becauſe he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal his guilt, had cauſed him to be put to death. Thus murder and adultery became the crimes with which he was chargeable.—Theſe aggravated crimes were bighly provoking to the God of holineſs. He beheld them with indignation. Nathan, therefore, is divinely commiſſioned to ſound in the ears of David an alarming report, that he may be awakened hereby to confeſſion and repentance; for he was now, it appears, ſleeping in his iniquity.—Nathan, inſtructed of God, went well furniſhed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his errand. He knew how to take the wife in their own craftineſs: as muſt be fully evident, when we look into the ſermon which he preached to his royal heater
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:036116_0004_1007E7F22D841598"/>and conſider his application, which naturally follows. <hi>And the Lord ſent Nathan unto David; and be came unto him, and ſaid unto him, There were two men in one city; the one rich and the other poor. The rich man had exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many flocks and herds: But the poor man had nothing face one little ewe-lamb, which he had bought and nouriſhed up: and it grew up together with him and with his children: in did eat of his own meat, and drink of his own cup, and lay in his boſom, and was unto him as a daughter. And there came a traveller unto the rich man, and be ſpared to take of his own flock, and of his own herd, to dreſs for the way-fairing man that was come unto him, but took the poor man's lamb, and dreſſed if for the man that was come to him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When Nathan had thus uttered the body of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, it ſeems, he made ſome pauſe; gave David an opportunity to reply; and, perhaps, he thought that a perſon of ſuch diſcernment would at once ſee his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and there would be no neceſſity that he ſhould be more particular or pointed.—But alas! the deceitful, the infatuating nature of ſin!—David, with all his wiſdom did not, at this time, know himſelf. He readily ſaw the horrid crime of the rich man in Nathan's parable, and deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed at it, denounced againſt him immediate and inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble death: but he ſaw not himſelf involved in this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His mind was ſadly blinded. The prophet, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was put to the painful neceſſity of applying his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe <hi>plainly,</hi> otherwiſe it was likely to have no good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.—<hi>Thou art the man,</hi> ſaid Nathan who hath done this. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſrael, I anointed thee king over Iſrael, and I delivered thee out of the bands of Saul: And I gave thee thy maſter's houſe, and thy maſter's, wives into thy boſom, and gave thee the houſe of Iſrael and of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah; and if that had been too little, I would moreover have given unto thee ſuch and ſuch things. Wherefore haſt thou deſpiſed the commandment of the Lord, to do evil in his ſight? thou haſt killed Uriah the Hittite, and haſt taken his wite to be thy wife. Now therefore the ſword ſhall never depart from thy houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:036116_0005_10081B1056AB3130"/>
Nathan having told him his tranſgreſſion in this <hi>plain</hi> manner, and the puniſhment he was doomed to ſuffer becauſe of it, <hi>David ſaid, I have finned againſt the Lord.</hi> He freely acknowledged his guilt, and was ready to take to himſelf the condemnation of death.</p>
            <p>The text and context thus viewed will naturally fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh us with the following leading propoſition, as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of diſcourſe on this occaſion, viz.</p>
            <p>That ſuch is the moral blindneſs and inſenſibility of men, that it is neceſſary for miniſters to uſe great <hi>plainneſs</hi> in delivering to them the goſpel-meſſage with any good proſpect of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>The ſpeaker would remark, that he is far from preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to dictate a mode of preaching to his fathers, and brethren in the miniſtry. It is his wiſh and aim only to offer his own opinion with freedom and candour upon a ſubject of the laſt importance; a ſubject which ſo nearly cencerns the everlaſting weal or woe of the ſouls of men. This, he flatters himſelf, will be diſagreeable to none, who has the leaſt ſincere deſire of turning many to right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs, and thus of ſhining forever as diſtinguiſhed ſtars in the firmament of divine glory.</p>
            <p>To proceed, then, according to the propoſition.</p>
            <p>Men are prone to look upon their own character with a partial eye, and to think of themſelves more highly than they ought to think. They quickly perceive when oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers do amiſs, but in reſpect to themſelves they have little or no diſcerning. They ſee not their own picture, when clearly and fully drawn to their view; and will not think it reſembles them, unleſs poſitively told it does in the plaineſt terms. So unwilling are they to think their own conduct wrong, that when it is painted before them in the moſt ſtriking light, they are ready to apply it to oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and haſtily condemn <hi>them</hi> while themſelves are the perſons criminal. Thus inſtead of conſidering that a <hi>beam is in their own eye,</hi> they would fain diſcover a <hi>mote in the eye of their brother.</hi> Such is naturally the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind, and ſuch the turn which ſin has given to the human mind. Experience and obſervation muſt have
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036116_0006_10081B11D8A11D60"/>ſhewn us all the truth of theſe remarks; and ſcripture examples fully confirm them. The caſe of David juſt noticed, ſeems ſufficient for this, even did the Bible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain nothing more of a ſimilar nature.</p>
            <p>David, we have every reaſon to ſuppoſe, was a man of no common or inferior abilities. Without doubt his pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etrating judgment, his clearneſs of perception, and wiſdom of diſcernment were far above the level of men in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: This we muſt conclude from his advanced ſtation, and the many advantages attending it. Add to all theſe the ſpecial grace of God, with which his mind was richly furniſhed. Under all theſe ſuperior endowments and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, David muſt be conſidered as a perſon eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly qualified to hear divine truth, and make right applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. And one would have thought, that a word to a perſon of his talents would be ſufficient;—that a mere hint would anſwer the purpoſe. But it was found quite the reverſe. He had fooliſhly forſaken God, and was left to ſink in the mire of his own guilty pollution. His conſcience was at this time put to ſilence, and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious principle within him was ſtifled. He had left his great Head; his ſtrength was conſequently gone; and he was like other men, ſave only that his ſuperior judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and underſtanding remained. This evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been his melancholy ſituation, when Nathan came to him; for otherwiſe, how could he be ſo inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his aggravated impiety! The prophet finding his condition to be ſuch, was inclined to catch him, as it were, with guile. He knew him to be ſtill capable of judging between right and wrong, although ſo blinded reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf; he therefore related his conduct in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of another. He told him of a man who had done thus and ſo. David immediately discovered the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this man's deed, and declared what his fate ſhould be.</p>
            <p>Now had Nathan left the matter here; had he gone his way and ſaid no more; we cannot ſee that what he had already ſaid would have been of much benefit to his bearer, for his meaning was not taken. The perſon to
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036116_0007_1007E7F6DA911238"/>whom he ſpake was ſtill in darkneſs as to his own ſtate. But Nathan did not mean to leave him ſo. He was <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>nt to be an inſtrument for awakening him from his ſtupor, and he intended that nothing ſhould fail through his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs. When, therefore, he ſaw that the parable in itſelf had not the deſited effect, he explained and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied it. He told David that be was the perſon who had done thus wickedly; and laid before him a particular ſtatement of the crimes which he had committed, and the circumſtances which rendered thein ſingularly heinous. This plain dealing, theſe home truths made him tentibly ſeel their ſorce. And what was the conſequence? He began to come to himſelf. He found where he was. His guilt ſtared him in the face. He ſaw himſelf condemned out of his own mouth. In no way could he juſtify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Indeed, he had no diſpoſition to attempt this. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than had ſtated facts ſo clearly and pungently, that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction at once ſlaſhed upon his mind. He confeſſed his ſin before the Lord. And from what the prophet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſaid to him, it appears, he was willing to abide the ſentence which he had uttered againſt one of his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But Nathan told him he ſhould not die, for the Lord had put away his ſin; and declared what judgments ſhould come upon him, and upon his family, for his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</p>
            <p>What could more directly prove the truth of the prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſition before us than the things now mentioned? If the renowned king of Iſrael, a man greatly favoured of God, with all his ſagacity, muſt have truths cloſely preſſed to his conſcience, in order to find them applicable to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and in order to his being profited by them; then we may, it is thought, ſafely conclude that the ſame is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for all hearers of the goſpel now. Nathan might have repeated parable after parable to David, but it does not appear that they would have been of any real advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to him, unleſs he had ſaid, <hi>Thou art the man.</hi> This plain ſentence ſtruck him more powerfully than all things elſe which he ſaid. So miniſters may deſcribe the <hi>general</hi> character of wicked men once and again, but unleſs they
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036116_0008_10081B135A99DC38"/>take ſome method to let their hearers know that <hi>they</hi> are <hi>these</hi> wicked perſons, and ſhow in what their wickedneſs conſiſts, it will not be likely to profit them, or effectually impreſs their minds. They will be inclined to apply the deſcription to others, inſtead of taking it to themſelves.</p>
            <p>The ſpeaker would not be underſtood here as in the leaſt inſinuating, that miniſters <hi>are ſufficient of themſelves</hi> to ſay <hi>any thing as of themſelves</hi> which ſhall be ſavingly profitable to their hearers. All their <hi>ſufficiency is of God.</hi> His Spirit alone can crown their labours with ſucceſs. But this can in no degree leſſen their ſolemn obligations to faithfulneſs and plaineſs in warning their people, by declaring to them their ſinfulneſs, and what muſt await them without repentance. For unleſs they are thus faithful and plain in their addreſſes, they can have no ground for expecting the Sprit's influence to accompany their endeavors; nor will what they deliver have a tendency to affect the heart, but will leave it inſenſible as before.</p>
            <p>That men are by nature morally blind and inſenſible the ſcripture<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of truth are full in declaring. As a full demonſtration of this, we need only hear it ſaid of them, that they <hi>have the underſtanding darkened, being alienated from the life of God, through the ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the blindneſs of their heart: being paſt feeling:</hi> And that <hi>they ſeeing, ſee not: and hearing, they hear not, neither do they underſtand. They are ſottiſh children, and they have none underſtanding: they are wiſe to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036116_0009_10081B153767F5C0"/>to Iſaiah was, <hi>Cry aloud, ſpare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and ſhew my people them tranſgreſſion, and the houſe of Iſrael their ſins:</hi> that is, deſcribe their tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſo clearly and fully as that they cannot but ſee them. <hi>Spare not</hi> through fear or favor. The meſſage from God to Ezekiel was, <hi>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the houſe of Iſrael: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. When I ſay unto the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thou ſhall ſurely die; and thou giveſt him not warning, nor ſpeakeſt to warn the wicked from his wicked way to ſave his life: the ſame wicked man ſhall die in his iniquity: but his blood will I require at thine hand.</hi> Moſt weighty was the motive here held before the prophet for being plain and pungent in addreſſing the people of his charge. It is recorded of the people in Iſaiah's time, that they <hi>ſaid to the ſeers ſee not: and to the prophets, prophecy not unto us right things, ſpeak unto us ſmooth things, prophecy deceits.</hi> It is evident, that this blind and inſenſible people wiſhed not to have plain and pointed things told them, leſt they ſhould be conſtrained to ſee and feel: they therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the prophets to go directly aſide from their duty. In the Apoſtle Peter we have a direct example of plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in preaching and the happy effects of it. <hi>Ye men of Iſrael,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>hear theſe words: Jeſus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you, by miracles, and wonders, and ſigns, which God did by him in the midſt of you, as yourſelves alſo know: Him, being delivered by the determinate counſel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands crucified and ſlain.—Know aſſuredly, that God hath made that ſame Jeſus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Chriſt. Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and ſaid unto Peter, and to the reſt of the Apoſtles, men and brethren, what ſhall we do? Then Peter ſaid unto them, repent, and be baptized every one of you, in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> And we find, that they did repent, and were ſavingly converted, to the number of three thouſand.</p>

We may next come to the perfect examplar of all.</p>
            <p>Chriſt, who muſt be acknowledged the ſtandard of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the great pattern for all who publiſh his goſpel, ſpake to his hearers in the plaineſt and moſt direct terms. His admirable ſermon upon the mount was cloſe and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, aimed directly at the heart, and excellently adapted to expoſe its hidden iniquity. It ſhows clearly and fully the inſufficiency of all outward forms and rites in religion, while inward, vital piety, is neglected; and thus it was directly ſuited to detect the characters and conduct of the ſelf-approving Phariſees, who regarded only the externals of divine worſhip. The hypocriſy, the worldly-minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the raſh and cenſorious ſpirit, of many of his audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence are pointedly ſpoken againſt in this ſermon of Jeſus. When he was preaching to ſome who <hi>truſted in themſelves, that they were righteous, and deſpiſed others,</hi> he delivered the parable of the Phariſee and Publican; than which nothing could be better calculated to humble their pride and ſelf-conceit. Chriſt not only gave a general deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Scribes and Phariſees, when he preached to them, but expreſsly and repeatedly ſaid to them, <hi>Ye fools and blind: and wo unto you ye blind guides:</hi> and he plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told them wherefore he denounced this woe. Having uttered ſomething which his diſciples wiſhed him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, he ſaid unto them, <hi>Are ye alſo yet without underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?</hi> Although he had a tender regard for Martha, yet when ſhe complained to him of her ſiſter, he utters this ſharp rebuke, <hi>Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things.</hi> Hence, it appears, that the diſciples of Chriſt, as well as others, muſt have great plainneſs uſed with them, or <hi>he</hi> would not in his preaching have dealt ſo plainly. He perfectly knew what was neceſſary and beſt on all occaſions. He knew, that however wiſe men might be reſpecting things of this world, yet in things of a truly religious nature, they were but mere fools. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called them ſo. <hi>O fools, and ſlow of heart,</hi> ſaid he to the two diſciples, <hi>to believe all that the prophets have ſpoken.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſaid of Chriſt as a preacher, that <hi>he ſpake as one having authority.</hi> He ſpoke at once to the conſciences of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036116_0011_1007E7F896E38328"/>them who heard him: accordingly, it is ſaid of ſome to whom he ſpake, that <hi>being convinced by their own conſcience, they went out one by one, beginning at the eldeſt, even unto the laſt.</hi> He told his hearers their wickedneſs without any reſerve, and the puniſhment it merited. He deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their different characters ſo juſtly and particularly, that each individual muſt ſee himſelf intended in the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and muſt know whether he belonged to the claſs of ſaints or to the claſs of ſinners. He addreſſed all accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their various conditions. To hardened ſinners he was a <hi>ſon of thunder.</hi> His language to theſe was,—<hi>Fill ye up the meaſure of your fathers. Ye ſerpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye eſcape the damnation of hell?</hi> To ſinners ſeriouſly awakened he was a <hi>ſon of conſolation.</hi> To ſuch he ſpake in loving accents: <hi>Come unto me, all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you reſt. Him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> To his true follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers his ſpeech was graciouſly kind and condeſcending, when he found them walking in the truth: <hi>Bleſſed are ye, when men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you, and ſhall ſay all manner of evil againſt you falſely for my ſake. Rejoice and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven.</hi> In a word; ſo particular was Chriſt to the ſeveral ſorts of perſons that compoſed his auditory, that a <hi>Thou art the man</hi> came home to the boſom of each of them. He meant to exhibit divine truth ſo clearly and diſtinctly, that by the light of it all ſhould diſcover their true ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And in this he hath left an example for all who go out in his name.</p>
            <p>A number of INFERENCES, Suggeſted by the ſubject, ſhall now be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a plain inference from the ſubject, that miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>ought</hi> to be particular and direct in addreſſing their hearers, or in applying to them the truths they deliver. If Nathan did no more than his duty in ſaying to David,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036116_0012_10081B19DDD7B5A0"/>
               <hi>Thou art the man:</hi> thou haſt tranſgreſſed in ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and <hi>deſpiſed the commandment of the Lord: thou haſt killed Uriah,</hi> &amp;c. If John the baptiſt did not more than his duty in calling ſome of his hearers, a <hi>generation of vipers:</hi> If the Apoſtle Paul did no more than his duty in his plain ſpeeches to the Romans, Galatians, and others:</p>
            <p>If Chriſt himſelf, who could not but do right, is to be imitated in this reſpect; then aſſuredly it is the duty of miniſters to be faithful in the manner ſtated. They may and ought, as the foundation of their diſcourſes, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain and eſtabliſh ſome doctrinal truths. This they may do from the example of Nathan who firſt delivered a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to prepare the way for what followed. But like him, they muſt in the improvement ſuitably apply theſe truths to all preſent, that they may find themſelves concerned in them, and that they were deſigned for their benefit. They ſhould be ſo explicit and ſearching in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as to make it amount to the words of the text.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From the view juſt taken, in connection with the ſubject at large, may be inferred a good, and, perhaps, the beſt method of preaching. Nathan did not in the very beginning of his diſcourſe, as the firſt ſalutation, ſay to David—<hi>Thou art the man.</hi> Had he done <hi>this,</hi> it might have greatly provoked the royal perſonage. It is not to be ſuppoſed, that the king would have given a favorable reception to ſuch home-language <hi>immediately</hi> advanced, before any thing had been ſaid which might introduce it. The prophet, it ſeems, was aware of this. He therefore, like a wiſe preacher, firſt aimed in his diſcourſe to prepare the mind of his hearer for receiving truth. He repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented his conduct by a plain ſimilitude. The flagrant injuſtice and cruelty of the conduct thus repreſented, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid could not but at once condemn. Nathan knew he had now only to apply the ſimilitude, and his point was gained. This he could eaſily do, for he had only to let David ſee, that his own conduct was like that which he had condemned, and the work was done. So if goſpel preachers would be in the way moſt effectual for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hearers to feel, acknowledge and embrace the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:036116_0013_1007E7FEA0FCA808"/>truth, let them not <hi>immediately</hi> and directly deſcribe their wickedneſs with all its aggravations. This will be likely to irritate rather than profit. Let them firſt give ſuch a general and plain deſcription of moral conduct as ſhall be ſuited to convince the conſciences of all reſpecting what is ſin and what is holineſs. And when the conſcience is thus convinced, and brought to own and receive general truths, it cannot conſiſtently but own and receive partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular truths contained in, and inferred from them. When miniſters ſo adapt the body of their diſcourſes, as that the people, while they do not ſee themſelves intended, are conſtrained to acknowledge and approve what is morally right, and cenſure what is morally wrong; the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion becomes forcible and irreſiſtable. The hearers find themſelves condemned of their own conſciences, and are obliged inwardly to confeſs their guilty deſerts.</p>
            <p>This view is ſuited to reprove, on the one hand, thoſe ſermons which are <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>pointed</hi> from beginning to end, and which inſtead of <hi>benefiting,</hi> needleſsly <hi>offend</hi> and prejudice the mind againſt the truth; and on the other hand, it is ſuited to reprove thoſe diſcourſes which are <hi>general</hi> throughout, and which come not <hi>near</hi> the hearers, but ſuffer them to <hi>feel</hi> and <hi>think</hi> as if they were not in the leaſt concerned in what had been ſaid. This is going to either extreme, while the medium is to be choſen. The <hi>parable</hi> and the <hi>Thou art the man,</hi> make a good compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a profitable ſermon, while either alone will be found wanting.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We infer from what has been ſaid, that if it be the duty of Miniſters to be particular and direct in applying the truths they deliver, then ſurely it is the duty of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers candidly to receive theſe truths, and not take unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable offence becauſe of their plainneſs. We are not told that David was offended becauſe Nathan uſed with him ſuch great plainneſs. No: he received it cordially: he felt its force; and freely confeſſed the juſtneſs of the charge brought againſt him. In this he is a pattern for all who hear the word preached in its power and pungen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. They ſhould hear it with meekneſs, knowing that
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:036116_0014_10081B1B6250BAA0"/>it may become the means of ſaving their ſouls, if they do not wilfully reject it. It is a ſad mark indeed, when peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wiſh to hear <hi>ſmooth things</hi> to be <hi>daubed with untempered mortar:</hi> and are oppoſed to ſearching goſpel-truths. This was the character of moſt of the Jews in the time of Chriſt. <hi>He</hi> was too penetrating for them: <hi>his</hi> words <hi>pierced</hi> like ſwords. <hi>Ye,</hi> ſaid he to them, <hi>are of your fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the devil, and the luſts of your father ye will do. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I tell you the truth, ye believe me not. He that is of God beareth God's words: ye therefore hear them not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye are not of God.</hi> Thus cloſely did Chriſt addreſs them. But inſtead of receiving it calmly, and owning it altogether juſt, they replied, <hi>ſay we not well, that thou art a Samaritan, and baſt a devil?</hi> They were ignorant and blind in reſpect to ſpiritual things; and were diſpoſed to cavil at, and reject the moſt precious and intereſting truths. Theſe Jews were moſt unreaſonable and wicked in this reſpect. Their conduct was directly the reverſe from what it ought to have been. They oppoſed the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Saviour, and injured their own ſouls. And moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently could it be wiſhed that none might imitate them at the preſent day. It is undeniably the duty of Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be diſcriminating and ſearching. This is evident from what has been ſaid, that they can have no good proſpect of ſucceſs, unleſs they are. And that they may be ſucceſsful, ſhould be the earneſt deſire of <hi>them</hi> and of <hi>all.</hi> If <hi>this,</hi> then, be the incumbent and indiſpenſible du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Miniſters, it muſt of courſe be the incumbent and indiſpenſible duty of hearers to receive bible-truths in the love of them, however much they may expoſe their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs. Had David been angry with the prophet, and greatly oppoſed his plain meſſage, how would he have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſin to ſin, and brought tenfold more guilt upon his own ſoul. But he was far from this: His conſcience ſmote him, and he owned the fact. Thus ſhould all do, when they hear truths applicable to themſelves. But as God formerly ſaid to his prophet Ezekiel, ſo is he now ſaying to his Miniſters, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſpeak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, for they are moſt rebellious.</hi>

4. We infer from the ſubject, that we have great cauſe to lament that men are <hi>ſo</hi> blind and inſenſible in things which pertain to godlineſs, as to <hi>need</hi> ſuch plainneſs,—ſuch cloſe application of goſpel-truths, in order to ſee their own picture. It is the <hi>character,</hi> the moral blindneſs and weakneſs of men, which makes plain and pointed truths ſo <hi>neceſſary.</hi> Had Iſrael's king taken the meaning of Nathan, after he had ſpoken the parable; applied it to himſelf; appeared penitent; and acknowledged his ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral inſtances of tranſgreſſion; the prophet would not have been conſtained to ſay to him as in the text: he would have found no <hi>need</hi> for this. But when he had told him the ſtory of the poor and rich man; as David continued ſtill inſenſible reſpecting himſelf, what muſt the prophet do? He was ſent to him for <hi>good,</hi> and he wiſhed to be inſtrumental of doing <hi>this.</hi> But how ſhall he come to the king's heart? for unleſs he does this, he is not likely to benefit him. He would gladly uſe delicacy and tenderneſs with a perſon of ſuch exalted office and rank. He wiſhes not to be thought too raſh or ſevere, if mild meaſures will anſwer. He ſeems deſirous that he may take the <hi>hint,</hi> may ſee and repent of his error; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being told how bad he is in the <hi>plaineſt</hi> terms poſſible. But <hi>all</hi> will not do. Nathan is brought to ſee, that he muſt either leave his mind <hi>unimpreſſed</hi> with a ſenſe of his condition, or declare to him his meaning freely and fully without the leaſt paliation. This no doubt was a diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable dilemma. But he knew he muſt perform the miſſion he had received from God. He choſe to be a faithful ſervant of his great Maſter, and ſubmit the event to him. Alas! David, how great muſt be thy ſtupidity at this time, that nothing will bring thee to thy right ſenſes but a <hi>Thou art the man!</hi> As the conduct of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, and his inſenſibility reſpecting it, <hi>obliged</hi> Nathan to preach thus cloſely, ſo the conduct and inſenſibility of nearers in general <hi>now</hi> muſt <hi>oblige</hi> preachers to do the ſame. As David was quick to diſcern and cenſure the ſinfulneſs of another, without conſidering his own; ſo moſt hearers can quickly ſee the faults of others, and what
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:036116_0016_10081B1F3A4CBE60"/>truths belong to them, while <hi>themſelves</hi> are <hi>clear,</hi> and no part of the diſcourſe ſuits their own caſe. This obliges Miniſters to ſay in effect, you are the perſons meant, you are the guilty. <hi>Obliges,</hi> did I ſay? Yes; a ſenſe of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty obliges them to this. For it is no agreeable thing in itſelf to tell ſinners without reſerve what is their charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But <hi>this</hi> muſt be done. And it is truly to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that it is with ſuch difficulty the mind of man is brought to look in upon itſelf, and ſee its condition: —that all can ſo haſtily condemn others for that which they allow in themſelves, and diſcover the failings of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſo much ſooner than their own.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We may infer from the ſubject what is the great <hi>deſign</hi> of the Goſpel-miniſtry. It is to awaken ſinners to a ſenſe of their iniquities, and bring them to <hi>repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably we find Paul commiſſioned to the Gentiles for this important end, <hi>To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of ſatan unto God, that they may receive forgiveneſs of ſins, and inheritance among them which are ſanctified by faith that is in me.</hi> From this it is evident, that moral blindneſs is removed; ſaving conviction excited; ſpiritual freedom effected; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation accompliſhed, through the inſtrumentality of Goſpel-preaching. All men by nature, or in their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanctified condition, are as inſenſible to their true charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ill-deſerts as tranſgreſſors of the divine law, as Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid was to <hi>his,</hi> when the prophet approached him. They <hi>diſcern not the things of the Spirit of God.</hi> And as the Lord ſent Nathan to David for the expreſs deſign of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing and converting him; ſo <hi>He</hi> raiſes up, qualifies, and ſends his Miniſters to be ambaſſadors for him, and inſtrumental in the conviction and converſion of ſinful men. The miniſtry of the word is deſigned in the hand of the Holy Spirit to <hi>enlighten</hi> the minds of men, that they may ſee that they have ſinned, and what they deſerve as ſinners, and in this way become truly penitent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:036116_0017_10081B245397EA38"/>
Deeply impreſſed by this momentous deſign of their miſſion, how careful, how anxiouſly concerned ſhould Miniſters be, that they be found faithful meſſengers; that they fulfil the miniſtry which they have received of the Lord! What diligent heed ought they to take, that the deſign of their meſſage may not fail by their means! Are they ſent <hi>to warn the wicked of his wicked way, that he turn from it?</hi> let them do it faithfully and plainly, that they may deliver their own ſouls; and that the <hi>blood of him who dieth in his iniquity may not be required at their hand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let them fully deſcribe the ſtate and danger of ſinners, and like Nathan, apply the deſcription to the hearts of their hearers with the greateſt plainneſs. In thus doing, they have encouragement to hope for ſucceſs; and in thus doing, they will finally be clear from the blood of all men, even ſhould <hi>Iſrael not be gathered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My <hi>Friend</hi> and <hi>Brother</hi> will ſuffer me a word at this ſerious moment.</p>
            <p>It is preſumed, <hi>Dear Sir,</hi> that you have cordially ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſced in the leading ſentiments, which have now been advanced.

You are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly convinced, that great plainneſs is neceſſary in publiſhing to your hearers the Goſpel-report. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Miniſters may uſe this plainneſs, and ſtill not be ſucceſsful, yet none can have a well grounded hope of ſucceſsfulneſs without it. As you deſire, therefore, to ſucceed in your Maſter's work, you will aim plainly and faithfully to declare his meſſage; directly applying the truths you deliver to the caſes of all who hear them. For doing <hi>this,</hi> you have the Prophets, the Apoſtles, and Chriſt himſelf, as examples. And in <hi>this</hi> way, you will, <hi>by clear manifeſtation of the truth, commend</hi> yourſelf <hi>to every man's conſcience in the ſight of God:</hi> in this way, you may <hi>both ſave</hi> yourſelf, <hi>and them that hear</hi> you: and in this way, we wiſh you the bleſſing of the <hi>God of Jacob</hi> in your perſon, and in the people now about to become your charge.</p>

            <p>Accept our ſincere congratulations on the re-ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Goſpel-miniſtry among you. Receive the man of your choice as a prophet ſent you from the Lord.

            <p>The relation of a brief but true ſtory to this aſſembly at large, will conclude.</p>
            <p>A certain great King had an only ſon, tenderly beloved. The ſubjects of this King had revolted from him, and taken arms againſt his throne and government; without
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:036116_0019_1007E85AB17C2AC8"/>any other cauſe but that of their own free, criminal choice. This was a crime ſo great, that the King could pardon them in no other way, but by delivering his ſon to death for their redemption. This he did, and the ſon freely conſented to the will of his Father. The way being thus clear to receive the rebels again to favor, the King invites them in the moſt tender manner to lay aſide their rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious weapons, and return to him; offering them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete happineſs on this return. But they refuſe this kind invitation; they continue ſtill rebellious. Now, muſt not all ſay, that <hi>they</hi> deſerve the greateſt conceivable pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, not only for their revolt, but for their black in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude in refuſing a pardon! Let as many, then, as have not yet given cordial and ſaving belief to the Goſpel-report, make the application to themſelves. They are the perſons guilty. They are ſtill in a ſtate of revolt from God, and neglecters of the great redemption purchaſed by the death of Jeſus. Let them at once feel and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs their guilt before the Lord, and humbly implore his pardoning mercy; ſo that they may yet <hi>be found of him in peace,</hi> at <hi>the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

            <head>THE RIGHT HAND OF FELLOWSHIP.</head>
            <p>ALTHOUGH the great object of the chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as it reſpects mankind, is to reſcue them from wo and reſtore them to God and happineſs: and although all its real friends and eſpecially its miniſters, have this object ſo much in view and at heart, as to read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily deny themſelves many innocent gratifications to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it: yet this divine religion from the firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgation of it down through the long ſucceſſion of eighteen centuries, has met and been obliged to ſtruggle with inceſſant and various <hi>oppoſition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Strange to relate, it is openly neglected, oppoſed and deſpiſed by ſome whoſe greateſt good it ſeeks to promote, and who can enjoy no real good, but by its aid. And in ſome inſtances it is injured and wounded by its profeſſed, if not its real friends.</p>
            <p>Of this <hi>oppoſition</hi> to religion, in all its poſſible forms and attitudes, the adorable Author was not ignorant. And being the truth and omniſcient, and not capable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving mankind or his followers, gave early and public notice of it. And having the government of all things in heaven, upon the earth, and under the earth commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, and being wonderful in counſel, he at the ſame time provided both for the defence of his religion, and the ſupport of his ſervants. Declaring that the gates of hell ſhould never prevail againſt it. Bidding his little flock not to fear, for to them it was his Father's good pleaſure to give the kingdom.</p>
            <p>All the ſupport, relief and conſolation implied in this declaration and promiſe, the church and its true miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters may depend upon receiving.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:036116_0021_10081B25D625EC00"/>
And the giving the Right-Hand of Fellowſhip is in an important ſenſe a pledge and aſſurance to the party receiving it, of participating in the all-ſufficiency of grace.</p>
            <p>But as the wickedneſs of the human heart, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the adverſary are many and great, ſo great that men may think themſelves friends to Jeſus Chriſt, and promoting his cauſe, while in reality they are inadvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly or ignorantly doing things contrary to both; the poſſibility of this, ſuggeſteth the propriety of proceeding on ſuch an occaſion, and in ſuch an act as the preſent, with caution and a degree of fear.</p>
            <p>The church and its officers, are not authorized to give the Right-Hand of Fellowſhip indiſcriminately to every one who may deſire it. Nor upon any other principles than thoſe upon which the Apoſtles gave it. Nor may they forbear upon an exhibition of ſuch principles.</p>
            <p>When James, Cephas, and John who ſeemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto Paul, i. e. had ſuitable evidence of his qualifications to preach the Goſpel, they gave to him and Barnabas the Right-Hand of Fellowſhip, that they ſhould go to the heathens, while themſelves continued with the circumciſion.</p>
            <p>It is grace that qualifies the ſubject to receive, and the exhibition of that grace, authorizes him to claim, and the miniſters of Chriſt to give the Right-Hand of Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Nor can it be doubted, but that the Apoſtles, readily and with ſentiments of the moſt lively joy, gave the Right-Hand of Fellowſhip to thoſe their fellow-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, who were partakers of the ſame grace of God with themſelves.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, we the profeſſed friends and ſervants of Jeſus Chriſt, convened on this occaſion, having ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory evidence, that you have received the gift of grace, and are qualified to preach the goſpel and be a miniſter of his church, give you the Right-Hand of Fellowſhip.</p>
            <p>Hereby we publickly acknowledge you completely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with the ſacred office of a miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt: and equal in all reſpects with ourſelves; as the paſtor of this church, and the teacher of this people. And we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:036116_0022_10081B2759A25508"/>to ſupport and defend you in this character, to be tender of and faithful to it. To mourn when it ſuffers, and rejoice when it proſpers.</p>
            <p>Theſe engagements are reciprocal.</p>
            <p>We bid you God ſpeed.</p>
            <p>We congratulate you, Sir, in being a member, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed member of the moſt ancient, uſeful, and ſo the moſt honorable ſociety that ever did or can exiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the earth. A ſociety, whoſe principles, manners, and final object, as they needed not, ſo they have not ſought to hide themſelves in the darkneſs of the night, or in the clouds of ſecrecy; but to expoſe themſelves to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic eye, inviting the ſtricteſt examination, like a fair and magnificent city upon a hill. A ſociety whoſe good ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery event will advance; whoſe happineſs and glory will be perfected and rendered permanent by <hi>that</hi> which will eternally diſſolve and obliterate all other ſocieties and combinations of men, of nations, and of nature.</p>
            <p>We congratulate you, Sir, in being a member of the general aſſembly and church of the firſt-born of God: compoſed of Prophets, Apoſtles, and all the excellent of the earth. All who are to be made kings and Prieſts to God. And thoſe who turn many to righteouſneſs, to ſhine as ſtars forever. A ſociety to which the <hi>Lord of all</hi> hath made the affecting promiſe of "Lo I am with you always."</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the materials which form the broad ground of ſupport and ſtrong conſolation to every true chriſtian and miniſter. In the view of which, all the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, afflictions, and ſufferings of which religion can be the occaſion, are not only light, but vaniſh in a moment.</p>
            <p>May you, Sir, ever poſſeſs the wiſdom which cometh down from above, and conduct yourſelf among this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as becometh a miniſter of the meek and lowly Jeſus. That you may not merit blame, but the honor of being gentle, enjoy the pleaſure of a ſucceſsful, and reap the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of a faithful miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

            <head>THE CHARGE, BY REV. WILLIAM MORISON OF LONDONDERRY, <hi>(N. H.)</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Brother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE glorious Head of the church, who walks in the midſt of the golden candleſticks, holding the ſeven ſtars in his right hand, having ſeen fit, in his all-wiſe, governing providence, to releaſe you from the particular obligations you were under in another part of his vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard; and having inclined this people to call you, to take the paſtoral office over them, and at the ſame time diſpoſed your heart to accept their invitation;—and this Preſbytery, after the moſt candid attention to this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's requeſt, having received them under their care, and ſuſtained your Call, as orderly and regular: I now, in behalf of this Preſbytery, and by the authority of Chriſt, veſted in them, do charge you, as the ordained Miniſter of the 2d Church and pariſh in Newbury, in manner fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing:—</p>
            <p>Firſt, with all ſolemnity I charge you to preach the Goſpel of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, not in the enticing words of man's wiſdom, but in demonſtration of the Spirit, and with power; that your people's faith may ſtand, not in the wiſdom of men, but in the power of God. In doing this, you will ſtudy plainneſs of ſpeech and pathetic affection of mind, in all good fidelity, that your hearers may be fed with knowledge and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and impreſſed with the importance of the truths of God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:036116_0024_10081B2B6278A178"/>
Shun the declaration of no part of the counſel of God. Particularly hold up to view the diſtinguiſhing doctrines of Chriſtianity;—the Sovereignty of God over all things in all worlds;—his boundleſs benevolence, with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible juſtice;—his ſpotleſs purity, and his tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in Chriſt, which are over all his other works. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold to your hearers the depravity of the human heart; the neceſſity of regeneration, and the only way of juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, through faith in the imputed righteouſness of the glorious Mediator.</p>
            <p>Often dwell with delight on the comfortable doctrine of the perſeverance of the ſaints, as founded on the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of that covenant which is well ordered in all things and ſure. And while you teach that without faith in the blood of this covenant, it is impoſſible to pleaſe God; affirm alſo conſtantly that they who believe in God, muſt be careful to maintain good works; and that a viſible conformity to the law of God is a better evidence of real religion than any <hi>internal pretences</hi> whatever, without it.</p>
            <p>I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the quick and the dead, at his appearing, and kingdom;—preach the word, be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-ſuffering and doctrine;—ſhewing yourſelf to be a workman, who needeth not to be aſhamed, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dividing the word of truth, and giving to every one their portion of meat in due ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>In doing this complicated and delightful part of your duty, you will ſuit yourſelf to the various capacities and neceſſities of your hearers. You will charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor truſt in uncertain riches, but in the living God; that they do good,—be rich in good works,—ready to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute,—willing to communicate. Enjoin upon thoſe in the lower ſtations of life, obedience to their ſuperiors; not anſwering again, but endeavoring to pleaſe in all things.</p>
            <p>Exhort young people to be ſoberminded,—to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their Creator in the days of their youth. In all
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:036116_0025_10081B2DE2CBD640"/>things ſhew thyſelf a pattern of good works; in doctrine, uncorruptneſs, gravity, ſincerity and ſound ſpeech that cannot be condemned, that they who are of the contrary party may have no evil thing to ſay of you.</p>
            <p>Under impreſſions of divine authority, adminiſter the Sacraments of the New Teſtament to perſons properly or viſibly qualified. Know therefore the ſtate of your flock. —Viſit the ſick and afflicted,—the fatherleſs and widows; and imitate your Maſter, who in the days of his fleſh, went about among his people, doing good. As far as in you lies, be like feet to the lame, ſtrength to the weak, eyes to the blind, leading them like a good ſhepherd, in the green paſtures and by the ſtill waters of God's ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances. Adminiſter the government of Chriſt's houſe with prudence and impartiality, knowing no man after the fleſh,—not reſpecting perſons in judgment. Avoid fooliſh queſtions which gender ſtrife and alienation of mind. Remember, that the ſervant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gentle and courteous to all men. It is an important part of the miniſterial character to keep our own paſſions in due ſubmiſſion, and to prevent our minds from being unreaſonably ruffled, or agitated by the diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable occurences of life.</p>
            <p>A Miniſter's mind is ſupported by principle and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by experience.</p>
            <p>This is a kind of ſelf-poſſeſſion which will enable us to bear hardſhips, to ſurmount difficulties, to vanquiſh temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; and with ſteady hands and undaunted hearts, to perſevere in the chriſtian warfare as good ſoldiers of Jeſus Chriſt. It is under the influence of this temper of mind, that we are ſtrengthened to overcome evil with good; to profit them who hate and oppoſe us, and peradventure to deliver them out of the ſnare of the devil who are taken captive by him at his pleaſure. Agreeably to this, the wiſe man informs us, he that is ſlow to wrath, is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his Spirit than he that taketh a city.</p>
            <p>Neglect not the gift that is in thee by the laying on of the hands of the Preſbytery. Lay hands ſuddenly on no
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:036116_0026_1007E814AEB609D0"/>man. Keep thyſelf pure. Give thyſelf to pray<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> reading, to exhortation and to doctrine. Be an example to the believers, in word, in converſation, in charity, in ſpirit, in faith, in purity. Meditate upon theſe things; give thyſelf wholly to them, that thy profiting may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear unto all.</p>
            <p>In fine, dear, brother, ſtudy to glorify God in being wiſe to win ſouls, and have continual recourſe to him in whom treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge are hid; in whom it hath pleaſed the Father that all fulneſs ſhould dwell, and in whom all faithful miniſters are compleat for work and warfare. Be then faithful unto death, and he will give you a crown of life, and many we hope, in this place, as preſent ſeals of your miniſtry, and your crown of rejoicing in the day of the Lord.</p>
