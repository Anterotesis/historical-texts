         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>ACCORDING to your Deſire I now ſend you ſome Remarks upon Mr. <hi>Commiſſary</hi> GAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEN'S LETTERS to the Reverend Mr. WHITEFIELD, which you may either <hi>publiſh</hi> or ſuppreſs, as you think they deſerve.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Remarks on Mr. GARDEN'S <hi>Firſt</hi> LETTER.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Firſt</hi> conſiſts chiefly of an endeavour to prove Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> guilty of a Self-Contradiction, founded upon what he ſaith in his Sermon <hi>Entitled,</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>What think ye of Chriſt.</hi> pag. 18. <hi>viz.</hi> Obſerve my Dear Brethren the Words of the Article, Good Works are the Fruits of Faith, <hi>and follow after Juſtification.</hi> How then can they <hi>precede,</hi> or be any ways the cauſe of it? No; our Perſons muſt be Juſtified before our Performances are <hi>Accepted</hi>
                  </q> Upon which Mr. <hi>Garden</hi> obſerves, that Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> (hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd) this Article into a Contradiction to his own Doctrine, ſince he hath taught, <hi>that a true Faith neceſſarily preceeds Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication;</hi> and the latter part of the Article ſaith, <hi>that Good Works do neceſſarily ſpring out of a true and lively Faith.</hi> From
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004705_0004_100DBD3C22C3F6A0"/>both which Mr. <hi>Garden</hi> thinks it will follow, that Good Works do in fact go <hi>before Juſtification.</hi> The Argument is all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in theſe Words, <hi>viz.</hi> "Now if Good Works do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſpring out of a true and lively Faith; and a true and lively Faith neceſſarily preceeds Juſtification, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence will be, that <hi>Good Works do not only follow after Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, but preceed it alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This he aſſures us is a plain Conſequence. But I am apt to think it is a plain Conſequence to none, who have not that <hi>Scotch Second-Sight</hi> he ſpeaks of; i. e. an Ability of ſeeing that which is not. Indeed if Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> had ſaid, that <hi>Faith neceſſarily preceeds Juſtification</hi> any <hi>ſpace</hi> of <hi>Time, tho' ever ſo ſmall,</hi> he would have owned in Effect that Good Works <hi>go before Juſtification as well as follow it;</hi> and Mr. <hi>Commiſſary</hi> might have ſang <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>um</hi> with a much better <hi>Grace</hi> than he doth at preſent. The whole turns upon this ſingle Point: If Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> hath ſaid, that Faith preceeds Juſtification, any real ſpace of Time; <hi>Actum eſt;</hi> he muſt fall before his Adverſary. But if he doth not hold this Thing, the Commiſſary triumphs without any Victory.</p>
               <p>Now what Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> holds, as to Faith's preceeding Juſtification, this Reverend Gentleman tells us himſelf. In pag. 19. he ſaith, <q>That ſome ſew, who diſturb, inſult and abuſe their Neighbours for differing from them (meaning Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> and others) ſuppoſe that <hi>Faith and Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are coexiſtent,</hi>
                  </q> and <hi>that there is no ſpace between the firſt Act of a juſtifying Faith and Juſtification for Good Works to be exerted in.</hi> That is in other Words, that Faith <hi>preceeds</hi> Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, not in Time, but only in the order of <hi>Conception.</hi> Well then, this being Mr. <hi>Whitefield's</hi> Idea <hi>of Faith's preceeding Juſtification,</hi> (his Enemy himſelf being Judge) wherein doth it appear that he hath explained the Article into a <hi>Contradiction to himſelf?</hi> Doth it follow that becauſe he holds <hi>Faith and Juſtification to be coexiſtent</hi> that therefore they are <hi>not coexiſtent;</hi> that becauſe he ſuppoſes there is no room for Good Works to be exerted in between them, that therefore he ſuppoſes there is ſome room for them? If theſe are no Conſequences, then Mr. <hi>Garden</hi> is no Conqueror. How naturally might his own Words be returned to him again! <hi>Away with ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and contradictory Gibberiſh!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="unknown:004705_0004_100DBD3C22C3F6A0"/>
Surely this Man of Logick, when he comes to ſee there was no <hi>Knot</hi> at <hi>all,</hi> will <hi>wiſh he had been Aſleep when he challenged Mr.</hi> Whitefield <hi>to untie it if he could;</hi> and be heartily <hi>aſham'd of this ſame confident boaſting.</hi>

            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Remarks on Mr. GARDEN'S <hi>Second</hi> LETTER.</head>
               <p>MR. <hi>Whitefield</hi> having given this <hi>Gentleman</hi> to underſtand that <hi>be</hi> was too warm for a Diſpute; and deſit'd him to peruſe the Sermon again, and confute it in <hi>Print</hi> if he could. He Anſwers in his Second Letter, <q>That he is free from Warmth, and not willing to be put off in a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which was of ſo much Importance to his own Soul, and the Souls of his People: and therefore tells him what he hath firmly believed, and taught his People, beſeeching him in the moſt ſolemn Manner to reſtore him, if <hi>therein</hi> he hath departed from the Goſpel, and the Articles of his own Church.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What he firmly believes and hath always taught his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he faith is this, <q>That Good Works do as neceſſarily ſpring from a true and lively Faith, whither before or after Juſtification as Light and Heat do the Sun</q> It is well worth the while to Inquire here what he means by a <hi>true</hi> and <hi>lively Faith.</hi> And this he tells us very honeſtly in Pag 9. Line 1. <hi>That it is a Faith actually producing Good Works.</hi> This then being the ſettled meaning of a true and lively Faith, if we conſider aright, we ſhall find that the amount of what he uſhers in with ſo much Solemnity, is only this; <hi>viz.</hi> That he hath always <hi>firmly</hi> believed, and taught his Hearers, that <hi>Good Works always ſpring from the Faith that produceth Good Works;</hi> or to be plainer ſtill; that the Faith <hi>which produceth</hi> Good Works, <hi>produceth</hi> Good Works; than which it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible any thing ſhould be <hi>more Orthodox,</hi> or <hi>leſs Inſtructive.</hi> 'Tis needleſs for him to deſire to be ſet more right in this Matter: Nay as he hath always taught his Hearers this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, ſo let him teach it to them ſtill, for tho' it will do them no manner of Good, it may do them <hi>leſs</hi> Harm than other Doctrines they might hear in lieu of it. Mr. <hi>Garden,</hi> to do him Juſtice, did not attain to this unlucky Expreſſion <hi>Proprio Marte.</hi> It ſeems rather to be a Form of Words, <hi>venerable</hi> for <hi>Antiquity;</hi> their very <hi>Giants in Divinity</hi> ſpeak the ſame Things,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004705_0005_100DBD3E455518D8"/>and feed their People with the ſame <hi>wholeſome</hi> but not very <hi>nouriſhing Food.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The good <hi>Commiſſary</hi> goes on in continuation of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; Or <hi>that as the Body without the Soul is dead, ſo Faith without Works, whither before</hi> or after Juſtification, is dead alſo.</p>
               <p>In which Words he makes no Declaration of his Idea of Faith in Man's <hi>Juſtification,</hi> ſince he only ſets down a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Paſſage, without explaining it; which he knows his Adverſaries maintain to be <hi>their</hi> Belief as well as he that 'tis <hi>his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is juſt as if an <hi>Arian</hi> or <hi>Socinian</hi> ſhould ſay, that he firmly believed and had always taught his Hearers, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God;</hi> and without explaining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf further, deſire to be ſet Right, if in this he hath aſſered any Thing contrary to the Scriptures. Would not Mr. <hi>Garden</hi> himſelf think ſuch an <hi>Arian</hi> or <hi>Socinian,</hi> had ſaid <hi>nothing</hi> in all this, and therefore deſerved no Notice. And yet this is exactly his own Caſe, in ſaying that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves with St. <hi>James,</hi> that Faith <hi>without Works is dead,</hi> and deſiring to be reſtored, if he hath ſaid amiſs. Upon the whole, I have often heard of ſome who have a Talent of ſaying a great deal in a little: of others, whoſe Talent is to ſay a little in a great deal; and with theſe I incline to rank Mr. <hi>Garden,</hi> tho' ſome critical Readers, may be apt to thruſt him down to a third Claſs, alledging that thro' this whole Epiſtle he hath ſaid juſt nothing at all:

               <p>MR. <hi>Garden</hi>'s third Letter, is as he ſaith, a Supplement to his former, and containing a few Queries to the Reverend Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> concerning his Behaviour as a Presbyter of the Church of England. And he immediately attacks him with a Charge of wilful and malicious Slander againſt his Brethren Conformiſts, in the before mentioned <hi>Sermon</hi> pag. 18. <q>You have accuſed them in that Sermon,

Accordingly I ſhall ſet my ſelf to ſhew that the Clergy in general have run away from their own Articles, leaving them to the Diſſenters to keep for them: And more particularly that of <hi>Juſtification by Faith only,</hi> crying up <hi>dead Works</hi> in Lieu of it. That they have Deſerted the Articles Solemnly Subſcribed by them, will appear from the Proof of theſe two Aſſertions, <hi>viz</hi> (1) That their Articles were Induſtriouſly compiled in oppoſition to what are <hi>now</hi> called <hi>Arminian</hi> Errors; and (2) that their Clergy generally ſpeaking are Infected with this <hi>deadly Poyſon;</hi> and ſpread the Infection with all their Might.</p>
               <p>FIRST then I will attempt to make it evident that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles were Induſtriouſly compoſed, to confront what are called <hi>Arminian</hi> Errors. And this is ſo plain, at firſt ſight, that he that Runs may Read it in them. I doubt not but if a Million of unprejudiced Men, were to peruſe them, they would to a Man conſtrue them in this Senſe. Mr. <hi>Whiſton</hi> therefore, a Man of chief Note among them, being both afraid &amp; aſham'd of twiſting them into the Senſe of <hi>Arminius,</hi> acknowledges that they directly and expreſly aſſert the <hi>Calvinian Doctrines,</hi> and therefore he adviſes the Convocation to alter them, or to lay them quite aſide. (See Mr. <hi>Whiſton's</hi> Preface to Dr. <hi>Mather.</hi>)</p>
               <p>I know the Men of this Way have this Subterfuge, viz. that the Compilers of the Articles intended a <hi>double Meaning</hi> that ſo honeſt Men on both Sides the Queſtion might ſee their own Principles in them, and ſubſcribe them with a good Conſcience. But this is a broken Reed to lean upon. For in the firſt Place, it doth not ſeem conſiſtent with Simplicity and godly Sincerity, that a Number of Miniſters of the Goſpel, ſhould avoid <hi>Plainneſs of Speech</hi> with their utmoſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, and ſtudy Words of <hi>an uncertain Sound,</hi> while they
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004705_0006_100DBD4095BE8358"/>were declaring what they <hi>thought to be the Truth as it was in Jeſus.</hi> And the very Gentlemen who uſe this Evaſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect greatly upon themſelves, as well as upon the Authors of the Articles: For they do in Effect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Beſides, (in the next Place) the <hi>Preamble to the Articles</hi> ſaith, that they were compos'd with this View, that there might be <hi>Uniformity</hi> touching the Doctrine of true Religion: and if <hi>Uniformity</hi> and <hi>Diverſity</hi> be not the ſame Thing, then it follows, that the Compilers had no double Meanings in the Articles. In a Word, the Compilers ſay, that they deſign'd Men ſhould be of <hi>one</hi> Mind; theſe Gentlemen ſay, they <hi>deſign'd</hi> Men ſhould be of <hi>two Minds;</hi> and who could tell their Intent beſt, <hi>they themſelves,</hi> or <hi>theſe Men,</hi> let the World judge.

                  <hi>Johnſon</hi> may riſe up, and diſapprove of my taking this Point for granted. For in his ſecond Letter to his <hi>diſſenting Pariſhioners</hi> (i.e. to thoſe Pariſhioners of his, that are not his Pariſhioners) he aſſerts it is very abuſive to call him and his Brethren <hi>Arminians,</hi> ſince they don't hold every Thing juſt as <hi>Arminius</hi> did. But at this Rate, he might deny that there is an <hi>Arian,</hi> or <hi>Socinian</hi> upon the Face of the Earth, ſince thoſe that are called <hi>Arians</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> differ in ſome Things (full as much as they from <hi>Arminius</hi>) from their reſpective Founders, <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Socinus.</hi> However, if the Name of <hi>Arminians</hi> doth not exactly ſuit them; they muſt have ſome other Name invented for them, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>I now proceed to the <hi>particular Charge</hi> Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> brings againſt his Brethren of the Eſtabliſhed <hi>Clergy,</hi> viz. Their preaching up Juſtification by Works, and not by Faith only, as they are enjoined by their own Article. And hath Mr. <hi>Garden</hi> the Forehead to deny this? Yes, ſurely; and calls it a malicious Slander, without the leaſt Foundation of Truth to ſupport it; and yet poor Man, while he would clear the Clergy from this Charge, he owns the very Thing charg'd againſt them; and is a <hi>ſwift Witneſs againſt himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The Doctrine (ſaith he) which you are ſo angry at, and cenſure as preaching Juſtification by Works, and not by F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>th only, is this; That we are juſtified by Faith only, and not by Works; thus explained, viz. that we are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by ſuch a Faith as is true and lively, that is actually producing good Fruits or Works, and conſequently <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying</hi> them, as a neceſſary Condition, (but no meritorious Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe) of our Juſtification. pag. 8, 9.</q> That is, we are juſtified by ſuch a Faith as <hi>implies</hi> Works. <hi>Works</hi> are part of this Man's Definition of <hi>juſtifying Faith;</hi> nay an eſſential Part according to Biſhop <hi>Williams,</hi> whom our Author cires, as giving his own Sentiments. For "the Faith which juſtifies, (ſaith the Biſhop) 'is a <hi>practical Faith,</hi> and to which <hi>Repentance</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and <hi>Obedience</hi> (i.e. Works) do belong as <hi>the eſſential</hi> Parts of it." Which is exactly the ſame that others mean when they tell
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004705_0007_100DBD4225DFA5F0"/>us, that Faith in Chriſt, ſignifies Faith in him, and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs to him; an aſſent to the Goſpel, and compliance with it. However, tho' Works are an eſſential Part of juſtifying Faith, yet if we will believe Mr. <hi>Garden,</hi> they don't at all juſtify. Egregiouſly abſurd! As if that which is the <hi>eſſential Part</hi> of a Thing, ſhould have no Hand in what is done <hi>by</hi> that Thing. Common Senſe will tell any one, that if Faith doth juſtify, whatever is Faith doth juſtify; and ſince <hi>Works</hi> are Part of Faith, an eſſential Part of it, <hi>Works</hi> muſt alſo juſtify in Part: And then what becomes of their <hi>Juſtification by Faith only,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Garden</hi> is not aſhamed to ſay, he and his Brethren maintain. His way to creep out is no better, nor bigger than this: by Faith he means Faith and Works too; and then very cunningly holds, that we are juſtified by Faith only. Which is juſt about as Good, as if a Man ſhould ſay that the Duke of <hi>Marlborough</hi> only commanded in ſuch a Battle, and that Prince <hi>Eugene</hi> was not with him: and being urged, that he aſſerted what was contrary to <hi>known Fact;</hi> ſhould inſiſt upon it, <hi>that it was a certain Truth that the Duke only commanded, and that the Prince was not with him;</hi> making out his Aſſertion thus; that by the <hi>Duke of Marlborough</hi> he always means, <hi>the Duke</hi> of <hi>Marlborough, and Prince Eugene too.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then if this is what Mr. <hi>Garden</hi> means, what need is there of fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing, that we are juſtified by <hi>Faith only.</hi> For if his Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Faith be ſo large as to take in <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> too, what is there left to juſtify: By ſaying that we are juſtified by Faith <hi>only,</hi> he ſeems to exclude ſomething elſe which er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Men are apt to think doth juſtify; and in reality, he takes in every thing, and excludes nothing at all. And the Amount of this ſaying in his Mouth, and the Mouths of his Brethren, is only this; that Men are juſtified <hi>only</hi> by every thing, and by nothing elſe. It were to be wiſhed therefore that they would be a little more Logical for the future, and only ſay, <hi>that men are juſtified by Faith;</hi> leaving the needleſs Word <hi>only</hi> out of all their Writings and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes for ever.</p>
               <p>The Truth is, Mr. <hi>Garden</hi> and Friends ſee ſo much of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by <hi>Faith only</hi> in the Scriptures of Truth, eſpecially the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul;</hi> that they are aſhamed of holding
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004705_0007_100DBD4225DFA5F0"/>any Thing elſe but Juſtification by Faith only themſelves. But in as much as they don't <hi>believe it with the Heart;</hi> whenever they take it upon them to explain themſelves, they are always found out. They try to ſay <hi>Shibboleth,</hi> as well as others; but they can't frame their Mouths for ſuch an hard Word; after all their Endeavours an unavoidable <hi>Sibboleth</hi> comes and diſcovers who they are. Even the good Biſhop of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don himſelf is an Inſtance, ſhewing how impoſſible it is that any one whoſe Heart is not Right in the Article of <hi>Juſtification by Faith,</hi> ſhould expreſs himſelf upon that Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to the Satisfaction of thoſe who have a true Idea of it. For, when in his paſtoral Letter, he exhorts his Clergy, <q>to preach Juſtification by Faith only, ſo as to leave no Doubt upon the Minds of their Hearers but that Good Works are a <hi>neceſſary Condition of Juſtification:</hi>
                  </q> 'Tis no better than if he had accoſted them thus; My very good Presbyters, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you teach your People that they are <hi>juſtified by Faith only,</hi> never leave them till you have made them believe that they are not juſtified by Faith only: which Injunction of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip they are too careful to obſerve.</p>
               <p>If it be ſaid, that whatever Streſs the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> Mr. <hi>Garden,</hi> and all the <hi>Men of this Device</hi> lay upon Good Works, they don't look upon them as meritorious Cauſes of <hi>Man's Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> but that they allow that the Death and Sufferings of Chriſt, are what alone merit Juſtification for the rebellious Sons of Men. I anſwer, whoever charges them with this? The <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves own Chriſt's Paſſion to be the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Cauſe that Juſtification may be had for us with God. But then doth it follow that becauſe they don't hold Merit in this <hi>high</hi> Senſe, that therefore they don't hold it in any Senſe? That becauſe they are not worſe than the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in this Point, that therefore they are nothing like them?</p>
               <p>But to come directly to our Charge againſt them; and it is this; That ſince Chriſt hath merited Juſtification for Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, they together with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> hold that the way for them to <hi>merit,</hi> or to be intitled to this <hi>merited</hi> Juſtification, are <hi>Works of Righteouſneſs which they do</hi> The Reverend <hi>Commiſſary</hi> ſurely will not deny this Charge; for he hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I do not pretend to ſay that theſe Men have any Deſign of a total Reconciliation with that Church; or that they are as bad as Papiſts: For Mr. <hi>Bradbury</hi>'s ſaying, is what I agree to; viz. <q>That thoſe Proteſtants who hold Juſtification by Works have only the <hi>Heart</hi> of Popery without the <hi>Head:</hi>
                  </q> And 'tis certainly better to have only the <hi>Heart,</hi> than to have <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Heart</hi> too.</p>
               <p>Thus we ſee that Mr. <hi>Garden</hi> who charges Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> with Faiſhood and Slander, for ſaying he and others held Juſtification by Works, hath in Fact owned the very Thing by ſaying <hi>Good Works are Means of Juſtification.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Garden,</hi> I know, will be ready to ſay, as he hath ſaid, that tho' <hi>Good Works</hi> are <hi>Means of Juſtification,</hi> yet <hi>they don't juſtify.</hi> Which is no better than it he ſhould ſay, that Blows given with an <hi>Ax,</hi> were Means of cutting down a certain Tree; but yet the Tree was not cut down <hi>by thoſe Blows.</hi> For my Part I ſhould think that Means which do nothing are very poor Means; or rather no <hi>Means at all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But however, if <hi>Good Works</hi> muſt be <hi>Means</hi> of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> as I am perſwaded Mr. <hi>Garden</hi> thinks they are thorough Means, let what will become of his other Aſſertion, viz that Men are <hi>juſtified by Faith only;</hi> I ſhall mention ſeveral Things which follow from it. And</p>
               <p n="1">1. Will it not follow from hence that Good Works are <hi>the Only Means of Juſtification?</hi> I am apt to think that if they do <hi>any Thing</hi> in Man's Juſtification, they do <hi>every Thing;</hi> as may appear from the following Inſtance. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe two Men to have only <hi>that Faith without Works which is dead;</hi> they are at preſent undoubtedly in an unjuſtified State. Suppoſe further, that one of them doth <hi>Good Works,</hi> and doth them long enough <hi>to be juſtified;</hi> while the <hi>other's Faith is yet alone.</hi> The <hi>former</hi> will be juſtified, the <hi>latter</hi> not. And yet what is the Cauſe that the former is juſtified while the latter is not? why nothing, but <hi>Works of Righteouſneſs which he did.</hi> So that the <hi>whole</hi> of this Man's Juſtification curtis upon his <hi>Good Works.</hi> If i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> be ſaid, that this Man is not juſtified <hi>by his Works,</hi> but becauſe his Faith was <hi>lively</hi> and operative (as I expect it will be ſaid) I anſwer, this is ſaying nothing; and I ſhall
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004705_0009_100DBD4662AA7B30"/>take Notice of it But if it be ſaid that this happy Man, beſides his <hi>Works,</hi> had an increaſing <hi>Faith,</hi> more than he had when he firſt ſet out; and more than the other ever had; I Anſwer, The good Man's Faith was of the ſame Kind with the wicked Man's, and only ſuperiour in Degree (both being only Faith of Aſſent.) And if the bad Man's Faith did not juſtify him at all; ſo neither can a greater Degree of the ſame Faith be of a juſtifying Nature; And conſequently he that <hi>was juſtifyed,</hi> was juſtified by <hi>Works,</hi> and not by <hi>Faith.</hi> Or, if any Man will ſay, that he was juſtified <hi>by Faith,</hi> it can be only in <hi>this poor Senſe,</hi> viz. he was juſtified by Faith, only as Faith help'd him to do <hi>juſtifying Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. If good Works are Means of Juſtification, then a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Number of Good Works is neceſſary to juſtify every Perſon that comes into the World. I ſay not that the ſame Number of good Works will do for all. For, to keep to their Principle, they muſt ſuppoſe that a greater or leſſer Number ſhall be required, according as Perſons have been greater or leſſer Sinners; and according as the good Works they do are <hi>more</hi> or <hi>leſs</hi> vertuous, not to ſay <hi>meritorious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſequently no Man can tell exactly when he o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> others are juſtified; contrary to the Scripture, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts Men to be ſure of their Juſtification, and to rejoyce in a Senſe of it; becauſe 'tis impoſſible to know juſt how many Works will do. There are ſome that hold that no Man is juſtified <hi>in this Life:</hi> and that <hi>we muſt needs go out of the World</hi> before it can be ſaid of us, that God is at Peace with us. And I ſhall ſhew, that Mr. <hi>Garden</hi>'s Works have led him into this Error by and by: If he ſtands by one of his Biſhops whom he hath cited as giving his own Sentiments.</p>
               <p n="4">4. If Good Works are Means of Juſtification, this is an undeniable Conſequence, that a Man may attain to <hi>one half, two thirds, three quarters, ninety nine hundredths</hi> of Juſtification; may arrive ſo near to it that one Prayer, or good Wiſh more would certainly juſtify him; which Divinity St. <hi>Paul</hi> would never have own'd. The moſt <hi>unſeeing</hi> of Mr. <hi>Garden</hi>'s Friends may be ſenſible of no Conſequence <hi>here:</hi> And others may call it Cavilling and <hi>Sophiſtry,</hi> that don't deſerve an Anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer; and thereby keep up their Credit with their Hearers.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004705_0010_100DBD491320FCE8"/>But let them attempt fairly to prove that this <hi>frightful Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi> is <hi>good Divinity;</hi> Or if they are aſham'd to own it to be <hi>good Divinity,</hi> then let them prove that it is not <hi>their Divinity,</hi> and get rid of it they can: And they will find that <hi>Hic Labor hoc opus erit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſay again; that if Good Works are the <hi>Means of Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,</hi> there will be a neceſſity l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>id upon theſe Men to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge what I have now objected; and particularly that a Man may be ſo near a juſtified Eſtate, that one little good Work more, would certainly bring him into it. This will hold good in all manner of Works which require a Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of Time for their performance. Thus in the finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Houſe, or writing a Book, there is a certain Time, wherein one Blow more with the Hand, or one Letter more with the Pen, would compleat the <hi>Houſe</hi> or <hi>Book</hi> And ſo in Juſtification which is tho't by them a Work of long Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance, and effected by good Works as the Means; there muſt of neceſſity be a critical Inſtant, in which a Man may be ſo near being juſtified, that the doing the leaſt good Work that can be tho't of would juſtify him intirely. Well then; this being inſeperable from Mr. <hi>Garden</hi>'s dear Doctrine of <hi>Good Works being the Means of Juſtification,</hi> I would ask, (if it be lawful to ask a civil Queſtion) what would become of a poor Sinner, that ſhould be taken out of the World in that unhappy <hi>Juncture,</hi> wherein his Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſo near being effected, that there wanted but one good Wiſh, one, Lord have Mercy upon me, more, to have compleated it? Shall the Man be miſerable for ever for this Defect? Or, ſhall he be look'd upon as juſtified, tho' he had not quite worked out his own Juſtification? Or, laſtly, ſhall he be doom'd to <hi>Purgatory</hi> for a while, to ſatisfy for what was wanting, and thereby to be <hi>made meet for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of the Saints in Light?</hi> As the Papiſts poſitively hold, being induc'd by Mr <hi>Garden</hi>'s Principle of <hi>Good Works being the Means of Juſtification.</hi> Laſtly, I would ask, what will become of thoſe <hi>Good Works,</hi> which are the <hi>Overplus</hi> after a Man is juſtified? And whether it be not from this Doctrine that the Popiſh Prieſts teach that ſome Men may have more good Deeds than they need themſelves, and a little to ſpate for thoſe that want,</p>

Mr. <hi>Garden</hi> having to'd the "ſtrange Way, in which he and ſome others, hold Juſtification; he applies himſelf to Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> thus, <q>This is the Doctrine which you cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and are ſo angry at; but which notwithſtanding is the true Doctrine of the Goſpel; and agreably taught by the ancient Fathers; by the Church of <hi>England;</hi> by her Clergy at all Times; and (be not ſurprized) by your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, and Brethren Methodiſts, tho' not without ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Shuffle &amp;c. pag. 9.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To each of which Aſſertions I ſhall endeavour a proper Anſwer: And,</p>
               <p n="1">1. I utterly deny <hi>his</hi> Juſtification to be the Doctrine of the Goſpel: Nay I affirm it to be <hi>another Goſpel,</hi> brought from <hi>Rome;</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> knew nothing of St. <hi>Paul</hi> every where concludes that <hi>Men are juſtified by Faith without the Works of the Law,</hi> Rom 3.28. If he had thought that Works did any thing in Man's Juſtification, tho' never ſo little, he would certainly have acknowledged it, notwithſtanding all his Zeal for Faith; and not have determined peremptorily that they did nothing at all. How careful is he to diſtinguiſh between <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> in Man's Juſtification, left any one <hi>ſhould ſeek Juſtification, as it were by the Works of the Law.</hi> i.e. b. <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> mixed together, <hi>Gal</hi> 2.16. But do Mr. <hi>Garden</hi> and Brethren make this Diſtinction? No, verily; they chuſe to jumble them together for a Reaſon well known to themſelves, and to almoſt every Body elſe. Nay, St. <hi>Paul</hi> not only inculcates the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith without any <hi>impure Mixture</hi> of Works; but ſhews it to be of the laſt Importance to be believed. He teſtifies to the <hi>Galatians</hi> over and over, and to all Chriſtians to the End of the World, that whoever ſought to be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the <hi>Works of the Law,</hi> (as well moral as ceremonial Works) they <hi>had fallen from Grace, and Chriſt would profit them nothing,</hi> Gal. 5.4.</p>
               <p>This was what St. <hi>Paul</hi> teſtified ſeventeen Hundred Years ago And would to God that all his Succeſſors, would teſtify the ſame Thing, and not directly the contrary! Then ſhould we have the Doctrine of <hi>Grace</hi> reſtored to us, <hi>as it was at the firſt,</hi> and pure <hi>Chriſtianity, as it was in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</hi>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:004705_0011_100DBD4B64289780"/>Then would periſhing Souls no longer be ſtarv'd with the dry Husks of Morality, but be fed with Food convenient for them, and grow fat and flouriſhing in the Courts of our God.</p>
               <p>And bleſſed be the Name of God, that he hath in this Day of Darkneſs and Error raiſed up ſeveral Men full of Faith and of the Holy Ghoſt; Men whoſe great Buſineſs it is to preach this <hi>Truth as it is in Jeſus;</hi> and who have ſome of them ſpread the Savour of this Knowledge into diſtant Parts, undaunted with all the Perſecutions they meet with from <hi>wicked and unreaſonable Men Sing O Heavens, and Rejoyce O Earth!</hi> May they <hi>ſtill be ſtrong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might;</hi> and may the <hi>Word of the Lord ſpoken by them, have free Courſe, run, and be glorified.</hi> May the <hi>Lord of the Harveſt ſend forth other Labourers into the Vineyard of the ſame Spirit and Power.</hi> And may the <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Juſtification by Faith</hi> ONLY, <hi>cover the Earth, as the Waters do the Sea.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to return; Mr. <hi>Garden</hi> having conceded that St. PAUL held Juſtification <hi>by Faith,</hi> would have him expounded by St. JAMES, who ſaith that <hi>Faith without Works is dead being alone</hi> And it is very true that St PAUL ſhould be ſo underſtood. But tho' St. PAUL held undoubtedly that Works were the effect of a Juſtifying Faith, yet it never entered into his Heart, that Works had any Hand in <hi>juſtifying;</hi> as Mr. <hi>Garden</hi> and Brethren Dream it hath. I cannot but obſerve that as the Apoſtle PAUL and Mr. <hi>Garden</hi> differ, ſo there is no great Harmony between <hi>him</hi> and St. JAMES, even in this Paſſage, which he hath cited from him, as co reſpondent to his own Thoughts For certainly St. JAMES by ſaving that <hi>Faith without Works is Dead;</hi> ſaith that Faith <hi>with Works is not Dead</hi> Whereas our Divine thinks, that <hi>Faith with Works</hi> may be Dead as well as <hi>Faith without Works.</hi> Here Mr. <hi>Garden</hi> and Friends may Cry out <hi>Slander</hi> and <hi>Abuſe;</hi> but let them have a little Patience. For, in ſpeaking to the <hi>Twelfth Article</hi> of the Church, pag. 18. He ſaith that the Article dont mean to exclude <hi>good Works going before Juſtification provided that they are the fruits of Faith;</hi> ſo that there may be good Works according to him, which are the <hi>fruits of Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Man that hath this Faith and Works,</hi> not <hi>juſtified</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004705_0011_100DBD4B64289780"/>Faith <hi>with Works, which is Dead.</hi> For if Faith with Works dont <hi>Juſtify,</hi> then it <hi>is Dead.</hi> Aſtoniſhing Divinity this! This can only be avoided by ſaying what I wonder any Man is not aſhamed to ſay, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Faith with Works which goes before Juſtification is <hi>not Dead</hi> but <hi>Alive,</hi> as <hi>far as it goes:</hi> and that it there were more of it, or rather more Works <hi>tack'd</hi> to it, it would Juſtify compleatly.</p>
               <p n="2">II. This is ſo far from being the Doctrine of the <hi>Ancient Fathers,</hi> that the <hi>Fathers</hi> he hath ſelected as moſt for his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, dont ſay one Word in its Favour, but quite the contrary. For all that is here cited, is perfectly agreable to what is held by thoſe who ſuppoſe <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Juſtification are coexiſtent; and that there can be no good Works preceeding Juſtification.</hi>

               <p>But for your full Conviction, I ſhall ſhow from your Book of Homilies and Articles (1) What is that Faith which they hold does juſtify; and (2) That this Faith only is <hi>That</hi> which juſtifies. (1) In the 3d Part of the Sermon of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their Note in the <hi>Margin</hi> is in theſe Words—<hi>What is the true and juſtifying Faith,</hi> and anſwering to it in the <hi>Page</hi> is the Deſcription following — <q>For the <hi>right and true Chriſtian Faith</hi> is not only to believe that holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and all the foreſaid Articles of our Faith are true;

Wherefore <hi>that we are juſtified by</hi> FAITH <hi>only,</hi> is <hi>a moſt wholſome Doctrine,</hi> and very full of Comfort, <hi>as more largely is expreſſed in the</hi> HOMILY <hi>of Juſtification.</hi>

               <p n="1">1.

                     <hi>Well then the Doctrine the</hi> CLERGY <hi>preach is this,</hi> viz. <hi>That we are juſtified by ſuch a Faith only as is trus and lively, that is actually producing</hi> GOOD FRUITS <hi>or</hi> WORKS, <hi>and conſequently implying</hi> THEM <hi>as a</hi> NECESSARY CONDITION <hi>(but no meritorious Cauſe) of our</hi> JUSTIFICATION. <hi>This is indeed the true Doctrine of the Goſpel; and agreably taught by the ancient</hi> FATHERS — <hi>by the</hi> CHURCH <hi>of</hi> ENGLAND— <hi>by her</hi> CLERGY <hi>at</hi> ALL TIMES &amp;c.</q>

And now which ſhall we believe— Mr. <hi>Commiſſary,</hi> or the learned Bp DOWNAM, as to Matter of Fact? For as the <hi>Biſhop</hi> aſſerts and proves that <hi>Good Works</hi> are <hi>no Condition</hi> at all of our Juſtification, but that <hi>Faith in</hi> CHRIST <hi>is the</hi> ONLY <hi>Condition,</hi> and this <hi>only</hi> as an <hi>Inſtrument</hi> apprehending the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of CHRIST, and that this is the Doctrine of the <hi>Church of England</hi> and of the ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Writers</hi> in <hi>all Ages,</hi> whoſe Teſtimonies he expreſly produces. Mr. <hi>Commiſſary</hi> plumply contradicts him, and ſays with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> whom the <hi>Biſhop</hi> oppoſes, that <hi>Good Works</hi> are <hi>implied</hi> as a NECESSARY CONDITION of our <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi> and (without any Proof) that <hi>this</hi> is the <hi>true Doctrine of the Goſpel</hi> and agreably taught by the ancient <hi>Fathers,</hi> by the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and by <hi>her Clergy,</hi> at <hi>all Times.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed the <hi>Commiſſary</hi> happened here to own <hi>one</hi> moſt ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful and evident Truth, viz that the <hi>Preſent Clergy</hi> preach GOOD WORKS implied as a NECESSARY CONDITION of our <hi>Juſtification.</hi> But every Man of Learring knows that this is a Doctrine which the excellent Bp DOWNAM calls a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctrine and which he ſtrenuouſly oppoſes; and is indeed a <hi>modern Doctrine</hi> in the <hi>Proteſtant Church of England,</hi> and was never own'd, but oppos'd in the Church till the Return of thoſe two <hi>Popiſh Princes</hi> into <hi>England,</hi> viz <hi>Charles</hi> the II and his Brother <hi>James,</hi> in 1660 And now Mr <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary</hi> boldly aſſerts that <hi>This</hi> which Bp <hi>Downam</hi> oppoſes as a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Doctrine, <hi>is the true Doctrine of the Goſpel,</hi> and that <hi>this is the Doctrine which the Church of England Clergy Preach &amp;c.</hi>

See Pag 11. lin. ult From which Words of the <hi>Biſhop.</hi> and Mr <hi>Garden</hi>'s citing them with Approbation, may we not diſcover a very odd Opinion held by them both. viz. That no Man is, juſtified in this Life; and that we muſt needs go out of the World before it can be ſaid that we are
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004705_0017_100DBD5A287F3BB8"/>reconciled to our Maker? contrary to the Tenor of the Bible. For if <hi>Perſeverance</hi> is an eſſential Part of <hi>juſtifying Faith,</hi> there can be no ſuch Thing as Juſtification, while an eſſential Part of that which juſtifies is wanting; and this eſſential Part muſt be wanting all the Days of a Man's Life: for <hi>Perſeverance</hi> intends the whole of our Courſe.</p>
               <p>But however horrid this Opinion appears, conſidered in it's Repugnancy to Scripture, and Reaſon, it muſt be confeſs'd it looks much better if we take a View of it as grafted upon Mr. <hi>Garden</hi>'s Boſom <hi>Tenet,</hi> that Good Works are Means of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. Nay, if I could once ſwallow down the latter, I ſhould make no difficulty with the former If I really tho't Good Words to be Means of Juſtification. I ſhould think it more likely that a Man ſhould be juſtified by the Good Works he performed thro' his whole Life; than by the <hi>Obedience</hi> of (perhaps) a few Days Nay it looks much more modeſt, and aſcribes a leſs degree of Merit to Good Works, to maintain that all the Good Works a Man ever did are required to juſtify him, than to maintain, that half or one quarter of them (perhaps) will do very well.</p>

               <p>I Anſwer, Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s Charity muſt have been extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagantly large, to have ſuppos'd that they don't look upon Good Works as <hi>meritorious,</hi> when by Preaching, Writing, and Converſation, they declare they <hi>do.</hi> I don't ſay that they look upon Good Works to be meritorious of <hi>Condignity,</hi> but of <hi>Congruity only,</hi> with the more <hi>moderate Papiſts.</hi> Indeed the Word <hi>Merit,</hi> is a <hi>Name</hi> of ſuch evil Report, that they are perfectly aſhamed of it; but then they hold <hi>faſt</hi> the <hi>Thing,</hi> which is worſe than the <hi>Name;</hi> and will never be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to let it go. Nay, they have ſome of them the Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, to tax the <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> as if this Doctrine was p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This I have prov'd already, and need not do it again.</p>
               <p>To return therefore; Muſt Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> be deem'd a malicious Slanderer of theſe Men in what he hath ſaid of them? No verily. Unleſs, they may be thought Slande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of their own Selves. For when they <hi>ſpeak</hi> or <hi>w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Their very Charges of Falſhood againſt him, unluckily for them, prove <hi>that he is a Man of Truth,</hi> and <hi>that in his Spirit there is no Guile.</hi> And the grand Reaſon why they <hi>count him</hi> their <hi>Enemy</hi> is <hi>becauſe he tells them the Truth;</hi> having found our, and born Teſtimony againſt that baſe ſmugling Trade of Importing prohibited Goods from <hi>Rome,</hi> in which they are ſo deeply engaged.</p>
               <p>His 2d Argument (for 'tis very probable, <hi>he</hi> tho't it an Argument) is taken from what he ſaith no one will deny, viz. That <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Good Works</hi> are both <hi>Conditions</hi> of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and if of Salvation, then he inters they muſt be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Juſtification too; and conſequently that Good Works go before Juſtification. <hi>Q. E D.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then, I would tell him, that when he builds an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the <hi>Conſent of all,</hi> he muſt be ſore that all <hi>do Conſent;</hi> otherwiſe he will have no Foundation, and the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure, will be juſt good for nothing. And accordingly I now take away this Foundation, and ſet <hi>all a tumbling,</hi> by denying that Good Works, are ſo neceſſary to <hi>Salvation,</hi> that there can in <hi>no Caſe</hi> be <hi>Salvation</hi> without them. In which Denial I ſhall be born out by all that hate the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of <hi>Arminius;</hi> by the Church of England; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by Mr <hi>Garden</hi> himſelf: for this Gentleman ſeems (by his Conduct) ſo ſet upon being conſuted, that leaſt his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary ſhould not do it effectually without him, he ſcarcely ever falls to confute himſelf.</p>
               <p>The Followers of Mr. <hi>Calvin,</hi> it is well known hold that as ſoon as a Man believes he is juſtified, and that if God ſhould pleaſe to take him out of the World in that Inſtant, <hi>he would not periſh, but have everlaſting Live:</hi> tho' not <hi>one</hi> Good Work had been done by him.

The Truth is, Mr. <hi>Garden</hi> is either in <hi>Jeſt,</hi> or <hi>in Earneſt,</hi> when <hi>he forgives the Sins of poor dying People.</hi> If he is in <hi>Jeſt,</hi> (which I can't think of him) there is no more to be ſaid.

               <p>Perhaps, ſome Friend of Mr. <hi>Garden,</hi> will be ready to ſay, that when he forgives the Sins of dying wicked Men, upon their ſaying what is preſcrib'd for them to ſay in the <hi>Common Prayer Book, he</hi> hath Regard to ſome Good Works he ſuppoſes they have ſormerly done; or rather to all the Good Works which the poor ſick wicked Men ever did in the Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>without Good Works,</hi> that is Good Works <hi>formerly</hi> done by them. Without ſtopping to put ſeveral Queſtions which natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ariſe here; I will evade this Solution, by ſuppoſing the dying Penitent to be one, who had formerly been <hi>juſtified,</hi> but had at the Time the Miniſter comes to abſolve <hi>him,</hi> fallen from <hi>Grace;</hi> nor done one Good Work towards reinſtating himſelf into the divine Favour: I would now <hi>ask,</hi> whither, upon his ſaying in ſincerity what is <hi>preſcribed,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Garden</hi>'s <hi>forgiving him,</hi> he would <hi>really be forgiven by Gad.</hi> and taken to Happineſs, if he dy'd that Inſtant? If it be ſaid <hi>Yes</hi> (and I think no one will ſay <hi>No</hi>) then it is moſt plain, that the dying Penitent is forgiven (and would be ſav'd if he then dy'd) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Regard to Good Works.</p>
               <p>But perhaps it may be ſaid, that tho' in ſuch a Caſe, there is no Regard to Good Works <hi>paſt,</hi> yet there is to Good Works which the Perſon <hi>would have done,</hi> had he had a longer ſpace: That <hi>ſuch</hi> a Sinner, ſo <hi>dying</hi> is forgiven and received up to Glory, becauſe God ſaw the Validity of his Repentance, and that if there had been Opportunity, he would have brought forth Fruits meet for Repentance This is that <hi>vertual Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience which Dr.</hi> TILLDTSON, ſpeaks of, in his Sermon, from theſe Words, <hi>If ye live after the Fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>What hath been ſaid, might be applied to what he cites from Dr <hi>Jackſon</hi> However, leſt it ſhould he tho't a neglect to ſay nothing to him in particular, I ſhall conſider the Caſe which he ſuppoſes, <hi>viz.</hi>

Nay was all the Righteouſneſs of all the Scribes and Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees from the beginning to this very Day (and perhaps there never were ſo many Phariſees in the World at a time, as there are at this Day) I ſay, was all this Righteouſneſs transferr'd to one <hi>Man,</hi> he would not be ſo <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Righteous,</hi> as the Believer is the very moment of his receiving <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> by Faith. But if we ſhould grant Dr. <hi>Jackſon</hi> what there is no need of granting him, <hi>viz.</hi> that by <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> our Saviour means outward <hi>Acts of Righteouſneſs,</hi> as if it had been ſaid, <hi>Except your good Deeds, and Acts of Righteouſneſs</hi> are more and better than thoſe of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi>  there is no Difficulty in explaining the Words: The meaning will be this, that whatever Confidence Profeſſors may put in their <hi>Faith and Attainments,</hi> yet if in their Lives and Converſation, they don't exceed the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> they may conclude that <hi>their Faith</hi> is not the right ſort, and that they <hi>ſhall never enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>

               <p>He goes on and ſaith that the <hi>next following Article,</hi> entitled of <hi>Works before Juſtification,</hi> confirms his Aſſertion, viz.

               <p>This Gentleman ſpeaks of ſeveral trembling Fits which came upon him while he was writing his Letters; and in my Opinion <hi>this</hi> was a Place for him to have trembled in, and to have been horribly afraid. For it ſeems utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, that it ſhould enter into any Man's Heart, that the <hi>Compilers</hi> of the Article deſign'd to be underſtood in this Senſe.

Mr. <hi>Garden</hi> aſſures us, <q>that no one can be under any Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of disbelieving that Men are juſtified immediately upon their believing: and gives this very odd Reaſon for it, viz. Becauſe the leſs we are required to do, ſo much the happier is it for us, who are able to do ſo little, and who are ſo unwilling to do any thing at all.</q> Pag. 20</p>
               <p>That is in other Words, Since Salvation is eaſier upon the Suppoſition that Men are juſtified by Faith, before the doing of Good Works, than upon Mr. <hi>Garden</hi>'s Suppoſition, that Works are neceſſary before Juſtification; therefore any one would be rather tempted to believe the former to be right, than the latter, provided there were Grounds for it in Scripture. And I grant that were <hi>juſtifying Faith</hi> a Thing ſo ſcandalouſly cheap as the <hi>Faith of Aſſent</hi> is, he would be <hi>right;</hi> it would be an eaſier way to Heaven than <hi>his,</hi> and Men would NATURALLY hold <hi>Juſtification</hi> by <hi>Faith.</hi> But ſince <hi>juſtifying Faith</hi> is ſuppoſed to be a <hi>Principle infuſed</hi> into the Soul by the SPIRIT OF GOD, which Man can't attain to of himſelf, and which therefore is infinitely harder than doing <hi>dead Works,</hi> before Juſtification; 'tis the Difficulty of Salvation this way which makes Men <hi>naturally</hi> reject it, <hi>tho' a Man declare it unto them,</hi> and chuſe Mr. <hi>Garden</hi>'s way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.</p>
               <p>For they ſay thus within themſelves; if this <hi>infuſed Faith</hi> is neceſſary, as we know nothing of it at preſent, to it being out of our Power, it may be we never ſhall: And hence they will hold to <hi>that Way</hi> which ſeems <hi>moſt in their Power,</hi> and in ſpight of Scripture ſeek to be <hi>juſtifyed</hi> by the <hi>Works of the Law;</hi> tho' God himſelf by Inſpiration aſſures us that <hi>by the Deeds of the Law no Fleſh living ſhall be juſtified,</hi> Rom, 3.20.</p>
               <p>Nay, I would appeal to the Conſciences of Mr <hi>Garden</hi> and Abettors, whether or no the grand Cauſe of <hi>their</hi> Malignity againſt Juſtification by an <hi>infuſed Faith,</hi> be not a Fear that they are unacquainted with <hi>the Thing;</hi> and conſequently an Apprehenſion that if the <hi>Doctrine</hi> be <hi>true,</hi> they themſelves are in a State of Damnation as yet, and without ſo much Power to work out their own Salvation, as they chuſe to think themſelves poſſeſs'd of Had they comfortable Hopes that let this Doctrine be ever ſo true, they ſhould run no Riſque of <hi>Eternal Salvation;</hi> would they oppoſe the Doctrine with ſo much Vigour and Rage? I am ſure they would not. Vaſt
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:004705_0024_100DBD6AB48A9B78"/>Allowances ought therefore to be made by their Hearers and Readers, when they find them ſet for the Defence of the contrary way of Juſtification: For it is for their Intereſt; <hi>by this Craft they have their Comfort:</hi> If the other Way be right, they are undone for ever: And therefore it ſtands them in Hand, to be zealous againſt it.</p>
               <p>But with the <hi>Oppoſers</hi> of <hi>their Doctrine</hi> it is not ſo. Let it be never ſo <hi>Right</hi> they are not hurt by it. If <hi>this Faith</hi> ſhould be a Whimſey (as <hi>they</hi> think and call it) yet they hold and practice <hi>Good Works,</hi> at leaſt as much as their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; and therefore if the <hi>Arminian Juſtification</hi> be the right one, they ſhall be juſtified with an <hi>Arminian</hi> Juſtification.</p>
               <p>It would therefore be highly proper for <hi>Laymen,</hi> when they hear <hi>Miniſters</hi> on both Sides zealouſly cry down each others Method of Juſtification, to inquire with the wiſe Romans, <hi>Cui bono?</hi> i. e. What Advantage they propoſe to themſelves by their Zeal? And if they find thoſe who preach <hi>againſt Juſtification</hi> by an <hi>infuſed Faith,</hi> are afraid that the Doctrine ſhould be true; as moſt certainly they are, leſt they ſhould loſe their Peace: And on the contrary that thoſe Miniſters, who preach down <hi>their Juſtification,</hi> have no Intereſt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote by it, but only the <hi>common Salvation;</hi> theſe Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ought in Reaſon to go a great way with them.</p>
               <p>I am afraid Mr. <hi>Garden</hi> and Confederates, will make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <hi>merry</hi> rather than <hi>ſerious</hi> with theſe Things; alledging that <hi>this Faith</hi> is a meer <hi>Nonentity,</hi> and that all the Arguments in the World, cannot give a real Exiſtence to it. But why ſhould <hi>they ſpeak Evil of the Things which they know not; and ſport themſelves with their own Deceivings?</hi> They are ſenſible that the Scripture ſpeaks almoſt every where of <hi>a certain Faith</hi> which <hi>doth juſtify.</hi> They themſelves are aſhamed to ſay that the <hi>Faith of Aſſent</hi> doth <hi>juſtify.</hi> And as to what <hi>they</hi> call <hi>juſtifying Faith,</hi> they know it is not properly <hi>Faith,</hi> but a <hi>compound</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> together. Would it not be their Wisdom therefore to conclude that there is <hi>ſome other thing</hi> which is <hi>truly</hi> JUSTIFYING FAITH, and to ſeek after it? They have the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of <hi>thouſands,</hi> and <hi>thouſands,</hi> whom they muſt own to be as wiſe and as good Men as themſelves, <hi>who have obtained this Mercy of the Lord:</hi> and who will tell them that they build all their Hopes upon it, counting <hi>Faith
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:004705_0024_100DBD6AB48A9B78"/>of Aſſent,</hi> and <hi>unregenerate Morality</hi> in <hi>all its Glory,</hi> to be <hi>but Loſs and Dung</hi> in compariſon of it.</p>
               <p>Nay, there are many who can aſſure them that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the <hi>Times of their Ignorance,</hi> were <hi>Scoffers</hi> and <hi>Mockers</hi> at the <hi>Faith of God's Elect,</hi> being elated with <hi>unſanctified Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and the Pride of <hi>Philoſophy falſly ſo called:</hi> And that they have had their towering Thoughts and <hi>lofty Imaginations</hi> brought down to the <hi>Fooliſhneſs of an infuſed Faith;</hi> and that they would not be deprived of it for Millions of Worlds. Why therefore, ſhould theſe Men reject it upon the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of <hi>their own Want of Experience:</hi> for <hi>other Foundation can no Man have againſt it?</hi> Would not they themſelves call that <hi>Debauchee</hi> a <hi>Madman,</hi> who ſhould affirm there was no <hi>Pleaſure</hi> in a <hi>religious Life,</hi> becauſe he <hi>never found</hi> any in it? And yet this is exactly <hi>their own Caſe,</hi> who deny that the <hi>exceeding Greatneſs of God's Power</hi> is exerted upon the Souls of <hi>Believers,</hi> meerly becauſe they are not conſcious of any ſuch bleſſed Operations upon their own.</p>
               <p>Surely if they would be prevail'd upon to <hi>act as Men,</hi> and <hi>as Chriſtians;</hi> they would <hi>be jealous over themſelves with a godly Jealouſy,</hi> and <hi>cry mightily to GOD, that what they know not be would teach them:</hi> giving themſelves no reſt till the ſame Spirit which <hi>worketh</hi> in others, work <hi>effectually in them alſo,</hi> making them <hi>Partakers of like precious Faith:</hi> Which GOD of his infinite Mercy grant unto all that are deſtitute of it; through JESUS CHRIST our <hi>Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which brings me to the</p>
               <p>2d Thing, which was to ſhew that the Doctrine of a Man's being <hi>juſtified</hi> immediately upon his <hi>believing,</hi> is not only true, but a Doctrine of <hi>Importance</hi> Mr. <hi>Garden</hi> faith, that as long as this Foundation is <hi>held ſure,</hi> that Men are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by a true and lively Faith, that is, a Faith actually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Good Works; it is of no manner of Conſequence whether <hi>Good Works go before Juſtification, or not.</hi> And I grant that there is an Appearance of Truth in what he faith: And 'tis this <hi>Deceivableneſs of Error,</hi> which cauſes many inconſiderate Perſons, to conclude that 'tis not worth the while to ſet up one <hi>way of Juſtification,</hi> and to pull <hi>down the other;</hi> ſince both hold, that it Men don't <hi>Maintain Good Works,</hi> as well as <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Garden</hi> looks upon Good Works as <hi>what</hi> do (at leaſt in Part) <hi>juſtify:</hi> But Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> don't imagine that Good Works <hi>ſave</hi> Men in any Meaſure; but are only the <hi>genuine Effects</hi> of that which doth inſtrumentally <hi>ſave</hi> them, i. <hi>Faith.</hi> So that ſince <hi>Good Works</hi> are not <hi>ſo</hi> neceſſary to <hi>Salvation</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> as they are <hi>to Juſtification,</hi> according to Mr. <hi>Garden;</hi> nor neceſſary <hi>in the ſame Manner;</hi> it is abundantly evident, that Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s Arguments againſt the Clergy upon the Point of Merit, could not have been improv'd againſt himſelf by the <hi>Solifidians.</hi> And yet Mr. <hi>Garden</hi> is ſo perſwaded to the contrary, that he gives <hi>his Word and Honour,</hi> that in Caſe it can be ſhewn, that <hi>he</hi> can defend himſelf againſt a Charge of Merit, from <hi>Solifidians,</hi> better than <hi>himſelf</hi> and Friends can from the ſame Charge brought by <hi>him</hi> againſt <hi>them;</hi> he will turn <hi>Methodiſt,</hi> the next Moment.

               <p>I purpoſely omit making any Anſwer to what follows in this Letter about <hi>Fire, Fagot, Jeſuits, Deiſts, Perſecution</hi> &amp;c. becauſe there is nothing material contained in theſe Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs, that needs anſwering; and alſo becauſe I have been ſo long already in diſcuſſing other Matters.</p>

            <head>AN APPENDIX, Concerning the Rev. Mr. GARDEN'S Treatment of his Chriſtian Brother the Rev. Mr. WHITEFIELD.</head>
            <p>THE Occaſion of this Appendix is that vain glorious Paragraph in Mr. Commiſſary's Third Letter, dated at Charleſtown <hi>April</hi> 8. 1740, in the following Words—<q>But ſtill PERSECUTION—you cry out; — <hi>for</hi> WANT <hi>of it</hi> you mean: For OURS <hi>is</hi> NO <hi>Perſecuting Country for Religion;</hi> EVERY MAN <hi>may enjoy</hi> HIS OWN WAY <hi>in</hi> PEACE <hi>and</hi> SAFETY. But as you may regard the being <hi>Perſecuted</hi> as ſomething eſſential to a true Chriſtian, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to keep up the Spirit of Chriſtianity, you ſeem to be <hi>in Queſt and Purſuit</hi> of it; <hi>Pleaſe only to ſtep into a Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Country,</hi> SPAIN <hi>or</hi> PORTUGAL, <hi>and you'l hid fair, I dare ſay, to find it.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>And now we'l ſee <hi>how long</hi> the Rev. Mr. <hi>Garden</hi> will keep his Rev. and Chriſtian Brother <hi>Whitefield</hi> in WANT of <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution;</hi> and how long the Biſhop's <hi>Commiſſary</hi> will maintain the King's Province of <hi>South Carolina,</hi> to be <hi>no Perſecuting Country</hi> for Religion; how long <hi>every Man</hi> may enjoy <hi>his own way</hi> there in <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Safety;</hi> and how long his pious and excellent Brother Clergyman Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> had need of ſtepping into <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Portugal,</hi> to <hi>find</hi> out <hi>Perſecution.</hi> For</p>

            </p>
            <p>To make this evident, I ſhall here ſet down ſome of Mr. Commiſſary's bitter Words and Scoffings in his <hi>Third &amp; Fifth</hi> Letters, as follow — LETTER III. Dated <hi>April</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>In Page 8. Mr. <hi>Commiſſary</hi> charges Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> with 'wilful and malicious Slander'. Pag 9. 'Your Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence'. — Apparent Shuffle'. Pag. 12.

Pag 14 'Your Mob Harangues— Guilty of wilful Slander'. — Nonſenſe'.</p>
            <p>In Page 16, 17, 18 are Mr. <hi>Garden</hi>'s following Flouts on the late Rev. Learned, Pious and highly eſteemed Dr <hi>Edwards,</hi> one of the principal Ornaments of the Church of England in his Day, and doubtleſs now in Glory. — Page 16.

            </p>
            <p>I might recite other Paſſages; but am weary of them, and ſo I believe is the Chriſtian Reader. But on the whole, I would ask, whether this is the Language of a grave, meek and humble <hi>Miniſter</hi> and <hi>Diſciple of</hi> JESUS; or of a <hi>Biſhop's Commiſſary?</hi> Exalted with a ſecular Dignity over, and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down with Scorn upon his pious and labourious Brother; and a Brother flaming with a wondrous Zeal, and ſpending his Strength more than all other Men in theſe Parts of the World, for the <hi>Converſion</hi> of Souls, and <hi>Recovery</hi> of the <hi>Church of England</hi> to thoſe <hi>Pure Doctrines of Grace and Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;</hi> for which her <hi>firſt Reformers</hi> gloriouſly ſuffered Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom; but which Mr. <hi>Commiſſary</hi> now <hi>Derides,</hi> and ſays the <hi>preſent Clergy</hi> of the <hi>Church of England</hi> are of the ſame Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with him: tho' both He and They have all ſolemnly declared <hi>their unfeigned Aſſent</hi> to the contrary.</p>
            <p>And as when <hi>there was a Strife among</hi> the <hi>Firſt Miniſters of</hi> CHRIST, <hi>which of them ſhould be accounted the Greateſt</hi> — JESUS <hi>called them to him and ſaid, ye know that the Princes of the Gentiles exerciſe</hi> DOMINION <hi>over them; and they that are Great exerciſe</hi> AUTHORITY <hi>upon them; but</hi> IT SHALL NOT BE SO AMONG YOU, Luk. xxii. and Math. xx. So Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of a worldly Spirit, have in all Ages affected worldly <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Authority;</hi> like even thoſe firſt Miniſters of CHRIST, for which he juſtly blamed them; and like the Princes
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:004705_0029_100DBD780E34DF10"/>and other great Ones among the Gentiles, which he forbids them in the leaſt to imitate lin the Exerciſe of <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Authority.</hi> A moſt wiſe and gracious Prohibition! As all Ages reſtiſy; who have always found that the raiſing the Miniſters of Chriſt to worldly <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Authority,</hi> has rais'd their Pride, and made them Worldly, nouriſhed their ſpiteful Paſſions, ruined their humble Character; and given them a dreadful Scope to wreak their Malice and Revenge on thoſe beneath them. And <hi>none in the World have ſo cruelly uſed their Power as Clergymen inveſted with a worldly Dominion and Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The BRITISH COLONIES have indeed <hi>till now</hi> been hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily free from their terrible <hi>Dominion.</hi> But whoever conſiders the <hi>Spirit</hi> which Mr <hi>Garden</hi> ſhows in <hi>the above Expreſſions,</hi> will be apt to think that he only wanted a <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Opportunity</hi> to vex his Rev and Pious <hi>Brother</hi> in a more grievous Manner. And it is not long ere the <hi>Commiſſary</hi> finds an <hi>Opportunity,</hi> and readily lays hold on it, to make Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> know and feel his <hi>Power.</hi> As we in the</p>
            <p n="2">II. Place proceed to ſhow. For in the latter End of <hi>June</hi> following Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> goes from the Province of <hi>Georgia</hi> into the Province of <hi>South Carolina.</hi> On Thurſday <hi>July</hi> 3. enters <hi>Charleſtown.</hi> The next Day being Friday <hi>July</hi> 4, receives a Letter from the <hi>Commiſſary,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> immediately anſwers. On Saturday <hi>July</hi> 5, Preaches twice: and Lord's Day <hi>July</hi> 6 twice more. On the ſame Day he goes to <hi>Church</hi> both Forenoon and Afternoon: and as Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> writes in the following Words—<q>I heard the <hi>Commiſſary</hi> Preach as <hi>virulent</hi> and <hi>unorthodox, inconſiſtent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,</hi> as ever I heard in my Life. His Heart ſeemed full of Choler and Reſentment: Out of the Abundance thereof, he poured forth ſo many bitter Words againſt the <hi>Methodiſts</hi> (as he called them) in general, and <hi>Me</hi> in particular, that ſeveral who intended to receive the Sacrament at his Hands, withdrew. Never I believe was ſuch a Preparation Sermon preach'd before. I could not help thinking the Preacher was of the ſame Spirit with Biſhop <hi>Gardner</hi> in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Days. After Sermon he ſent his Clerk to deſire me not to come to the Sacrament, till he had ſpoke with me — I immediately retired to my Lodging, rejoycing that I was
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:004705_0030_100DBD7BED060BF8"/>accounted worthy to ſuffer this further Degree of Contempt for my dear Lord's Sake. <hi>Bleſſed Jeſus lay it not to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary's Charge.</hi> Amen and Amen.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon this I appeal to every impartial Reader, whether Mr. <hi>Commiſſary</hi> had not by this preceeding Management utterly <hi>diſqualified</hi> Himſelf from being look'd upon as an <hi>impartial Judge</hi> over a Brother Clergyman, whom he had ſo openly and opprobriouſly Reviled?</p>
            <p>But the more the <hi>Commiſſary</hi> rails, the more his People grow offended, and the more they leave him, and grow more cager of hearing another ſort of Preaching and another ſort of Language in the meek and humble Perſon reviled. And Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> being denied the Priviledge of Preaching in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> tho' deſired by great Numbers of that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety: where, when ever he officiates, he always uſes the <hi>Common Prayer Book</hi> and conforms thereto; as he accounts himſelf obliged, when in the <hi>Epiſcopal Churches:</hi> At the Deſire of the People, he Pray'd and Preach'd in the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Meeting Houſe:</hi> and accounting himſelf not obliged by Law to uſe the Common Prayer Book in them, <hi>be Pray'd without it.</hi> Upon which the very next Day, viz <hi>Monday July</hi> 7. Mr. <hi>Commiſſary</hi> could bear no longer, but begins the Exerciſe of his COMMISSARIAL <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Writ</hi> or <hi>Order.</hi>

               <hi>Friday July</hi> 18, and <hi>Saturday July</hi> 19, He Preached twice each Day again at <hi>Charleſtown.</hi> And <hi>Saturday</hi> after the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon Exerciſe, being deſired by the <hi>Apparitor</hi> to go to the <hi>Commiſſary;</hi> Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> went: and at his Deſire to <hi>ſware</hi> he wou'd <hi>lodge his Appeal</hi> within a <hi>Twelve Month,</hi> and to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite <hi>Ten Pounds Sterling,</hi> and finding the Commiſſary's Orders gave him Authority to require it; Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> took the <hi>Oath,</hi> and promiſed to leave <hi>Ten Pounds</hi> in the Hands of a Friend &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And thus Ends this famous &amp; FIRST <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> or rather <hi>Clergical Court</hi> in the BRITISH COLONIES. But what a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pities, that it was not the firſt Time erected, to puniſh ſome <hi>notorious Immorality</hi> or other either in the <hi>Epiſcopal Clergy</hi> or <hi>People,</hi> to <hi>whom alone</hi> it belongs, and among whom, <hi>as well as others,</hi> there are <hi>notorious Immoralities</hi> enough abounding in all the Colonies? Or if an <hi>Epiſcopal Clergyman</hi> muſt be the primary Object of this Commiſſarial Power &amp; Severity; what a thouſand Pities, that their <hi>Firſt Court</hi> was not erected to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſome or other for Playing at <hi>Cards</hi> and <hi>Dice,</hi> or <hi>haunting Taverns,</hi> or <hi>too much conſtant Drinking,</hi> or <hi>ſome other Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour,</hi> which they need not take much Pains to find or prove.</p>
            <p>But <hi>inſtead of this</hi>—To begin with <hi>a young Clergyman</hi> of ſuch extraordinary Sanctity of Manners, and of ſuch ſlaming Zeal to promote the higheſt Degrees of Piety, as we find none ſuperiour ſince the Apoſtles Days — It cannot poſſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend <hi>theſe Courts</hi> to the Eſteem of the Britiſh Colonies; but rather to their univerſal and great Diſpleaſure. For tho' the <hi>common People</hi> in EUROPE are generally ſo ignorant and weak as to hug the Chains of the Clergy, and keep them on as faſt and long as poſſible — the AMERICANS live in a freer Air, more generally taſte the Sweets of Liberty; and being nearer an Equality of Birth and Wealth, there being Land enough for every induſtrious Perſon; there are fewer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them in Dependance on others, they are generally more
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:004705_0032_100DBD81DEB04ED8"/>knowing than the <hi>common People</hi> in EUROPE; and are not like for ſeveral Ages, or as long as this near Equality remains, to deſire the <hi>Dominion</hi> of the <hi>Clergy</hi> over them</p>
            <p>Upon viewing the <hi>Terms</hi> of the WRIT, I believe there is ſcarce a Man of common Senſe in all the Colonies that can forbear ſmiling to read of the mighty heinous Articles ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the <hi>Pious</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> Mr WHITEFIELD—<hi>concerning the meer</hi> HEALTH <hi>of</hi> HIS SOUL <hi>and the</hi> REFORMATION <hi>and</hi> CORRECTION OF HIS MANNERS <hi>and Excrſſes; and</hi> CHIEFLY [CHIEFLY] <hi>

            <p>And is not ſuch a prodigious Expence as this a <hi>grievous Perſecution?</hi> or is Mr. <hi>Commiſſary</hi> ſo full of Humanity as to account it no Perſecution at all?— the <hi>Crime</hi> ſo great, and the <hi>Fine</hi> ſo little! —I ſaid the <hi>Fine;</hi> For tho' ſtrictly ſpeaking, it may not be called a <hi>Fine;</hi> it is in Reality <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually heavy</hi> on the helpleſs Sufferer.
