            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE benevolence, as well as the power and wiſdom of the Deity, is conſpicuous in all his works; but eſpecially in his proceedings with his intelligent, though degenerate offspring in this part of his dominions. Here it ſhines with ſuch luſtre, as to be viewed with admiration by the angels in heaven. God hath not left himſelf without witneſs in any age or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in that he did the inhabitants good, not only giving them rain from heaven and fruitful ſeaſons, filling their hearts with food and gladneſs; but affording them ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, in a greater or leſs degree, to ſeek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him and find him. In many periods indeed, and in many parts of the world, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſat in darkneſs, and in the region of the ſhadow of death; while to a few others a light ſprung up ſuſſicient to guide their feet into the way of peace. The chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized world, moſt certainly, can ſay, that God hath given them all things pertaining both to life and godlineſs: for <hi>God, who, at ſundry times and in divers manners, ſpake in time paſt unto the fathers by the prophets, hath in theſe laſt days ſpoken unto us by his Son,</hi> concerning <hi>the great ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; God alſo bearing them witneſs, both with ſigns and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, according to his own will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:030426_0003_0FE6D16B7B503FF8"/>
But I am not to aſſume the queſtion that is to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed, nor take for granted the point to be proved. The general ſubject which claims my attention on this occaſion according to the direction of the pious Founder of this Lecture, being REVEALED RELIGION, it is juſtly expected that I endeavour to adduce ſome arguments in ſupport of Divine Revelation; at leaſt, that I collect and prepare ſome materials, which may contribute to the ſtrength of the great fabrick of Chriſtianity; or rather, point out to view the ſolid firmneſs of thoſe everlaſting pillars upon which this noble edifice is eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>That a ſyſtem of doctrines and precepts, under the denomination of the Chriſtian Religion, has been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and now exiſts in the world, is without contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy: for it is equally the butt of ſneering unbelievers, and the boaſt of its profeſſors; a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a rock of offence to the former; but a corner-ſtone of hope and joy to the latter. It is almoſt univerſally acknowledged too, that this religion derived its name and its origin from Jeſus Chriſt, whom his followers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be the true Meſſiah; but whom the Jews inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a deceiver, and crucified as a malefactor; whoſe memory and whoſe oracles are ſtill ſacred in the eſteem of Chriſtians; but treated with the greateſt indignity by modern unbelievers.</p>
            <p>Now the great queſtion reſpecting Chriſtianity, is this, Is it from Heaven, or of men? and concerning its Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and propagators, Were they actuated by a <hi>lying ſpirit,</hi> or did they ſpeak as if they were <hi>moved by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and act, as if <hi>endued with power from on high?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In order to the full diſcuſſion of this queſtion, it may be thought neceſſary to examine minutely the intrinſick excellency of this religion, in its doctrines, duties, and profeſſed deſign; its external ſupports, in the fulfilment of prophecies and the exhibition of miracles; the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of its author, and of his commiſſioned apoſtles; its progreſs and eſtabliſhment in the world; and the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the hiſtories and books, which contain this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and tranſmit an account of its author and firſt propagators. But this opens an extenſive field. On theſe heads many volumes have already been written.
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:030426_0004_0FE6D16B8B124E08"/>It is impoſſible, therefore, that the limits of one ſermon ſhould contain the principal part of thoſe arguments, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged in their connected and corroborating order, by which the belief of Chriſtians is ſupported, and the cavils of infidels refuted. A diſcourſe of an hour, under my management, may tire the patience of the audience, but not do juſtice to the ſubject. Something however muſt be attempted.</p>
            <p>If we take a view of Chriſtianity as forming a complete ſyſtem of religion, adapted to the nature, and adequate to the exigencies of mankind, it appears to be a <hi>work</hi> of ſuch magnitude, and a <hi>good</hi> of ſuch importance, as no abilities of man could ever excogitate or effect.</p>
            <p>Juſtly to apprehend the worth of a benefit, we muſt conſider the neceſſities of thoſe upon whom it is confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and its ſuitableneſs to anſwer thoſe neceſſities. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining the ſyſtem of Chriſtianity by theſe marks, we ſhall find it fully to anſwer the demand.</p>
            <p>It needs not the labour of argument to prove, that all fleſh had early corrupted their ways, and become guilty before God. The malady, which was caught by our firſt parents in Eden, ſpread from father to ſon; and from one generation to another grew more inveterate and alarming. In matters of religion, the whole head was ſick, and the whole heart faint. The heathen nations <hi>became vain in their imaginations, and their fooliſh heart was darkened. Profeſſing themſelves to be wiſe, they became fools; and changed the glory of the incorruptible God, into an image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four footed beaſts, and creeping things.</hi> The diſeaſe was univerſally felt, and in ſome inſtances lamented: but who could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigate a remedy? The wiſeſt and beſt of the ancient philoſophers, from a mournful ſenſe of the prevailing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, could only wiſh and hope for an able reſtorer. Wiſe as ſome of them confeſſedly were, the world by their wiſdom knew not God, nor the way to approach him with confidence, nor to ſerve him with propriety. They were not fully perſuaded of the immortality of the foul; much leſs that all would hereafter be judged and recompenſed according to their works. They felt not therefore the powers of the world to come; 'nor did
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030426_0005_0FE6D16CF5374698"/>they perceive in thoſe rules of virtue, which they were able to diſcover, the authority of a divine legiſlator, or of an impartial judge.' They knew not of an advocate to intercede in their behalf with their offended ſovereign. They knew not of a divine illuminator and ſanctifier to help their infirmities, to aid their endeavours, and to complete their reſtoration. To men in ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, how welcome, how every way ſuitable, would the plan of recovery by Chriſt be, as it is delineated and propounded in the Bible? a plan, which provides for all their moral wants through time, and for their complete happineſs through eternity. The wiſdom of its conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion muſt excite their admiration; its ſuitableneſs and moſt benevolent tendency muſt recommend it to their joyful acceptance; as well as the atteſtations by which it is ſupported, claim their cordial belief.</p>
            <p>To decide the queſtion whether the powers of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind are adequate to the taſk of informing the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, regulating the paſſions, and directing the conduct, in all the exerciſes of religious worſhip, and in all the practices of moral duty, let us inquire what theſe boaſted powers have accompliſhed, without the aid of revelation. Much indeed have they accompliſhed, and to great heights have they attained, in ſcientifick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches, and in the improvement of the uſeful, and of the refined arts. But what have they effected in the ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of theology; in the neceſſary art of getting rid of the guilt and dominion of ſin; and of aſſuring men's hearts before God, with reſpect to their future well-being? In what book but the Bible, or thoſe which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their origin from the Bible, can we find a ſcheme of divinity, worthy of the great Firſt Cauſe; or a rational ſyſtem of moral duties, fuited to all ranks, capacities and fituations, enforced by proper ſanctions, and encouraged by adequate aſſiſtances, and eternal rewards? In this view, can it appear credible, can it appear poſſible, to any unprejudiced mind, that the goſpel plan, ſo comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and yet ſo conſiſtent, and which unfolds ſuch aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing myſteries, and ſuch ſublime and intereſting doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, can owe its origin, its eſtabliſhment, its moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py influence, to the uninſpired genius, or the unaſſiſted
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030426_0006_0FE6D16D08423260"/>powers of man; much more, of an impoſtor ſpeaking in the name of the Lord, when the Lord ſpake not by him? In this caſe he could not be a good man: but certainly, none but a good being can be the author of a ſcheme, which not only proclaims, but promotes, both in a direct and conſequential manner, <hi>glory to God in the higheſt, peace on earth, and good will towards men.</hi> Such is the profundity of the plan, ſo complicated and yet ſo regular, that we might on this account give credit to the apoſtle Peter's aſſertion, that <hi>even the angels deſired to pry into it;</hi> and to the apoſtle Paul's, <hi>I certify you, brethren, that the goſpel, which was preached of me, is not after man. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> In the ſame ſpirit of devout aſtoniſhment, which St. Paul expreſſed on another occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, muſt we exclaim, <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the wiſdom and the knowledge of God! how unſearchable are his judgments, and his ways paſt finding out! For who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been his counſellor? Or who hath firſt given unto him, and it ſhall be recompenſed unto him again? For of him, and through him, and to him are all things: to whom be glory forever. Amen.</hi> The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſuch a ſcheme muſt have been poſſeſſed of infinite wiſdom, infinite comprehenſion, and infinite benevolence. This great and aſtoniſhing <hi>work,</hi> this complication of benefits, <hi>bath the Son of God ſhewed us from his Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The goſpel is evidently a remedial inſtitution. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, the apparent, and the experienced deſign of it, is to recover the race of men from depravity and guilt, in a way, which reflects the greateſt honour on the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and authority of a righteous and univerſal Sovereign, and which is moſt admirably ſuited to the rational and immortal, though corrupted and debilitated nature of the creatures to be recovered. However deficient every other plan of reſtoration, and every effort of human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity is, <hi>we are complete in him, who is the head of all principalities and powers, and in whom are hid all the treaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures of wiſdom and knowledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"If we contemplate the goſpel by itſelf," ſays a maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly writer on this ſubject,
<note place="bottom">* WHITE.</note> "and view it in its own
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030426_0007_0FE6D1772A912BC8"/>light, we ſhall have abundant reaſon to admire it, both for the purity of its nature, and the tendency which it has to promote the intereſts and the happineſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. It bears on it the ſtamp of a divine original; and there is a ſpirit which animates and beautifies it, that muſt ſtrongly prepoſſeſs the pious mind in its favour. The purity of the goſpel is indeed a deciſive evidence whence it proceeded; an evidence ever preſent, ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er legible; and which no diſtance, whether of time or of place, can efface. That purity is ſuch as we ſhould nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally expect from the ſentiments which uncorrupted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture leads us to form of the Divine Being. If he had not already vouchſafed to grant us a revelation of his will, with reſpect to our duty both to him and to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; yet if we had reaſon to expect that he would grant it, the cleareſt dictates of our judgment, and the nobleſt ſentiments of our heart, would lead us to anticipate the ſame diſplay of benevolence on the part of God, and the ſame encouragements to virtue among men, which we find in the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>"As it is pure, ſo it is perfect. Whatever is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for us to know, is diſcovered by it; and diſcovered in ſuch a manner as to anſwer all the purpoſes of a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation deſigned for general information. In the goſpel we have nothing ſuperfluous, nothing perplexing. Every declaration of ſin and duty; every promiſe to engage us to purſue the one, and every threatening to deter from the other, are brought forward with a preciſion and ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity, which leave no room either for the perverſe to cavil, or the impartial to miſtake. There is no vice which it does not detect, even within the darkeſt retreats of the mind. There is no duty connected with the glory of God, the welfare of our neighbour, or the true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of ourſelves, but what it unfolds and illuſtrates. Its precepts are not only clear in their mode of delivery, and beneficial in their tendency; but they are enforced by every motive that is calculated to affect the heart, and to exalt and purify its affections. The promiſe of divine forgiveneſs and compaſſion through Jeſus; of help and ſuccour through the Divine Spirit, are of the moſt ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and engaging nature, to beings encompaſſed with dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030426_0008_0FE6D17735F33FB0"/>of various kinds, and expoſed to moral weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and tranſgreſſions, which are degrading to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and deſtructive of our happineſs. But to inſpire us with the full ſoul of virtue and religion, it carries our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring minds beyond the contracted views of this mortal ſcene, to that exalted world of ſpirits, where we ſhall ever be advancing in knowledge and perfection, where every offence ſincerely repented of ſhall be pardoned, and every virtuous endeavour accepted and rewarded by him, who is our moſt compaſtionate father, as well as our moſt righteous judge."</p>
            <p>To ſtrengthen our belief that this religion is divine, let us view the character of its Founder. A ſucceſſion of illuſtrious prophecies, from Adam to Malachi, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the Meſſiah, who was to be a light to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, and the glory of his people Iſrael, were fulfilled in Jeſus Chriſt;—fulfilled in the time, place, and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his birth; in the ſufferings as well as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his life; in many circumſtances relative to his death, burial, and reſurrection; and in the ſalutary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and wonderful efficacy of his doctrines. As he was <hi>the holy child Jeſus,</hi> ſo it appears from his hiſtory that in after life <hi>he knew no ſin,</hi> and <hi>fulfilled all righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> He had no faulty defects to ſully his character, but every virtue and grace to adorn it. Into whatever cities or villages, concourſes or retirements, we trace the footſteps of Chriſt, we ſhall diſcover in him the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate prudence and piety; the moſt exalted and ſteady regard to the honour and laws of God; and the moſt warm and diſintereſted benevolence to mankind. In ſhort, as Dr. Doddridge obſerves, "We ſee in him every thing amiable, every thing venerable. We ſee a perfection of goodneſs no where elſe in the world to be ſeen or heard; and numberleſs arguments plead at once to perſuade the heart, that it is abſolutely impoſſible ſuch a PERSON ſhould be engaged in a deſign founded in known falſehood, and tending only to miſlead and ruin his followers."</p>
            <p>Jeſus Chriſt alſo, in the courſe of his active and uſeful life, performed many miraculous works, as atteſtations of his divine miſſion. His miracles, being performed with
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030426_0009_0FE6D1784B65ADC8"/>a benevolent deſign, might well be called <hi>good works which he ſhewed from his Father.</hi> Whoever acknowledges a God, muſt at leaſt admit the poſſibility of a miracle. The Framer of the great machine of nature, and of the laws by which it is directed, may, conſiſtently with his wiſdom and goodneſs, ſuſpend thoſe laws in any given inſtance, or increaſe their energy. He who has all pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and all hearts in his hands, may perform miracles im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by himſelf, or mediately by other agents; in either caſe, the great ends of religion are equally ſecured, and the proofs of his interpoſition equally apparent.</p>
            <p>It is manifeſt from many paſſages in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that Jeſus Chriſt conſidered the evidence ariſing from the mighty works which he wrought, as abundantly ſufficient to ſupport his claims to the Meſſiahſhip. <hi>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not: but if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works.</hi> As there muſt always be a perfect conſiſtency between the attributes, the nature and the proceedings, of an all-perfect being, it is certain that ſuch a being would not have affixed the ſanction of miracles to the cauſe in which our Saviour was engaged, had that cauſe been an impoſture. The ſame ſpirit of power which was given to our Lord with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out meaſure, was communicated to his apoſtles in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree ſufficient to enable them alſo to work miracles, as an evidence of the truth of their miſſion and doctrines. Theſe miracles, too, both of our Saviour and of his apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, were ſo numerous, ſo beneficial, and performed ſo openly, in the view of ſuch multitudes, as to be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcreened from the imputation of fraud and colluſion, or of a fortunate and accidental concurrence of ſecond cauſes. "They were too public to be the artifices of impoſture; too ſubſtantial, and too numerous, to afford the ſlighteſt ſuſpicion of undeſigned and fortuitous coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence." In a word, as the aforeſaid author
<note place="bottom">* WHITE.</note> obſerves, "ſhould the Divine Being in any inſtance ſo far coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract the common laws of nature as to produce a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; and ſhould deſign that miracle as a monument to future times of the truth of any particular doctrine, we cannot conceive any mode of communicating it more
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030426_0010_0FE6D178584CA848"/>effectual than that which he hath choſen. Stronger proofs could not be afforded conſiſtently with the deſign of the goſpel, which is not to overpower our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by an irreſiſtible and compulſory light, but to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us ſuch rational evidence as is ſufficient to ſatisfy moral inquirers, who are endowed with faculties to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the truth; but at the ſame time who have power totally to reſiſt it, and finally to forfeit its bleſſings."</p>
            <p>On the whole then, when we contemplate the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of Chriſt as delineated with admirable ſimplicity by his ſacred biographers; when we view him in the whole courſe of his publick miniſtry going about doing good, healing all manner of diſeaſes, caſting out devils, inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ignorant, and comforting the ſorrowful; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when we conſider the benevolent deſign of his miſſion, and that he actually devoted his life as a ranſom for ſinners; it gives a penetrating edge to the inquiry in my text, <hi>Many good works have I ſhewed you from my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for which of thoſe works do ye ſtone me?</hi> The ſame interrogation and appeal may his friends and followers make in behalf of his cauſe, and of the records of his life and doctrines; "Many good works are therein diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played from the Father; many advantages communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the world in general; many unſpeakable bleſſings, temporal and eternal, to individuals; for which of thoſe works, thoſe immenſe advantages, thoſe invaluable bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, is the cauſe rejected and vilified? For which of the doctrines, of the prophecies, of the promiſes, is the Bible ridiculed, and ſpurned through all the filth of the ſtreets?"</p>
            <p>But as the Jews anſwered the Saviour, ſo modern un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers reply now; "<hi>For a good work we ſtone thee not; but for blaſphemy, and becauſe that thou, being a man, makeſt thyſelf God.</hi> And as the Founder of the Chriſtian ſcheme was an impoſtor, ſo the ſcheme itſelf is a forgery. The ſacred books, as they are called, are not authentick. They were not written by thoſe whoſe names they bear; and the ſtory they tell is fabulous, and deſerves no credit."</p>
            <p>In vindication of himſelf from the charge of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and in proof of his commiſſion from the Father, our Lord, as we have ſeen, appealed to the miracles which
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030426_0011_0FE6D18036D4AAB8"/>he wrought, as ſufficient to carry conviction to every unprejudiced mind. To prophecies alſo, as well as to miracles, both Chriſt and his apoſtles frequently appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as proofs of their divine miſſion. We may add too, that as 'our Saviour referred to his mighty works as evidences of his power, ſo he referred to the intrinſick excellency and purity of the doctrines they were intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bear witneſs to, as an evidence that the power was of God.' In this manner, and to this day, do the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and internal proofs of Chriſtianity mutually illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and corroborate each other. The contempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Chriſt had the evidence of their ſenſes that he performed miracles. We, though ſo diſtant in time and place, have the evidence of credible teſtimony, that not only he, but his apoſtles in his name, performed them too; and that his religion ſpread and got footing in the world, in ſo ſpeedy and wonderful a manner, as demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated that the cauſe was of God.</p>
            <p>That we have not followed cunningly deviſed fables; but that we have the moſt ſolid foundation for our faith and hope in Chriſt Jeſus, we argue in this manner; "The facts recorded of our Saviour were recorded by thoſe who muſt know whether they were true or falſe. The perſons who recorded them, were under no poſſible temptations to deceive the world. We can only account for their conduct on the ſuppoſition of their moſt perfect conviction and diſintereſted zeal. That they ſhould aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert what they knew to be falſe; that they ſhould publiſh it with ſo much ardor; that they ſhould riſk every thing dear to humanity, in order to maintain it; and at laſt ſubmit to death in order to atteſt their perſuaſion of its truth, in thoſe moments when impoſture uſually drops its maſk, and enthuſiaſm loſes its confidence; that they ſhould act thus in oppoſition to every dictate of common ſenſe and every principle of common honeſty, every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint of ſhame, and every impulſe of ſelfiſhneſs; is a phenomenon not leſs irreconcileable to the moral ſtate of things, than miracles are to the natural conſtitution of the world."</p>
            <p>We may add too, that the writings, in which the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned facts are recorded and conveyed to us, have
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030426_0012_0FE6D1804690FFF0"/>all the marks of genuine ſimplicity, and an impartial regard to truth that can be reaſonably deſired; and they can be clearly traced from the age in which they were written, and the facts were ſaid to be done, through the ſucceeding ages down to our own times. This is not mere aſſertion without proof. A ſucceſſion of writers, both Jewiſh and Pagan, from the times of the apoſtles, to the times of the reformation, incidentally mention the ſame facts which are recorded in the New Teſtament, viz. that "the Chriſtian religion originated from one Jeſus; that the founder was put to death as a malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor at Jeruſalem, by the authority of the Roman gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, Pontius Pilate; that the religion nevertheleſs ſpread in that city and throughout Judea; and that it was prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agated from thence to diſtant countries; that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts were numerous; that they ſuffered great hardſhips and injuries for their profeſſion; and that all this took place in the age of the world which our books have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned. They go on farther to deſcribe the <hi>manners</hi> of Chriſtians in terms perfectly conformable to the accounts extant in our books." See for inſtance the writings of Tacitus, Suetonius, Pliny, and Joſephus; or if the direct teſtimony of Joſephus be diſputed, it muſt be granted that he gives no counter evidence; the ſilence therefore of ſuch a writer in ſuch an age, is rather in favour of the truth of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>But further, it is obſervable, that 'the whole ſeries of Chriſtian writers, from the firſt age of its inſtitution down to the preſent, in their diſcuſſions, apologies, argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and controverſies, proceed upon the general ſtory which our ſcriptures contain, and upon no other. The main facts, the principal agents are alike in all. Clem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, who heard St. Paul preach; Polycarp the diſciple of St. John; Ignatius a contemporary with Polycarp; Quadratus of the ſame age with Ignatius; Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, who flouriſhed little more than thirty years after Quadratus, have more or leſs reference to the life, the tranſactions, the crucifixion, the reſurrection, and the aſcenſion of Jeſus Chriſt; and give accounts of theſe things correſponding with the accounts which we have in the four goſpels, and in the Acts of the apoſtles.'
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030426_0013_0FE6D182DB874590"/>In ſucceeding ages Chriſtian writers have ſtill more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent references to the leading facts recorded in the goſpel hiſtory.</p>
            <p>It is to be remarked too, that we have the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of enemies as well as of friends, to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticity of the hiſtorical books of the New Teſtament. "The notice taken of the contents of theſe books by the early writers againſt Chriſtianity, ſhows that the accounts which Chriſtians had then, were the accounts which we have now; that we have the ſame ſcriptures which they had. It ſhews moreover that neither Celſus in the ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond, Porphyry in the third, nor Julian in the fourth century, ſuſpected the authenticity of theſe books, or ever inſinuated that Chriſtians were miſtaken in the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors to whom they aſcribed them. Not one of them expreſſed an opinion upon this ſubject different from that which was held by Chriſtians. And when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how much it would have availed them to have caſt a doubt upon this point, if they could; and how ready they ſhewed themſelves to be to take every advantage in their power; and that they were all men of learning and inquiry; their conceſſion, or rather their ſuffrage, upon the ſubject, is extremely valuable."

            </p>
            <p>A late popular and zealous defender of "the rights of man," has with equal zeal ſtepped forth the champion of infidelity; oppoſed the claims of the Redeemer, and diſturbed the peace of his ſubjects. This daring inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent has muſtered and ſet in array a hoſt of popular ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt the Bible, the citadel of revealed relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. But upon examination it appears, that this formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable phalanx conſiſts principally of the apparitions of thoſe armed forces which Celſus, Spinoza, and other ſucceeding leaders in the infidel Rebellion, brought into the field for the ſame purpoſe; but which were ſlain by the ſword of the Spirit wielded by the hands of Origen and innumerable other ſucceſsful eſpouſers of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian cauſe. Had this doughty hero poſſeſſed as much modeſty as boldneſs, and as much candor as wit; had he, like a juſt critick and philoſopher, exerciſed as great judgment and impartiality in ſearching out truth, as he
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030426_0014_0FE6D182E82D85C0"/>did acuteneſs and prejudice in ſpying out and magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faults; he would not have conſidered "a few chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nological, geographical, or genealogical errors—appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent miſtakes, or real inconſiſtencies as to hiſtorical facts, —needleſs repetitions and trifling interpolations," ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to invalidate the genuineneſs or authenticity of the ſacred writings; but giving the ſame credit to the authors of the reſpective books of the Old and New Teſtament which he gives to other hiſtorians, he would be ſo far from rejecting the Bible with contempt, that he would ſurrender himſelf a captive to its ſuperior ſtrength and authority. Yea, if the aforementioned qualities of the mind would permit him to demand ſtronger evidence for the authenticity of the ſcriptures than for that of any other books, in the exerciſe of thoſe qualities he would find ſtronger. But as theſe qualities were not poſſeſſed by him, or were not in exerciſe, he manifeſts great prejudice and ſpite againſt the goſpel and thoſe who are ſet for its defence, and great unfairneſs in his repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and arguments. He rejects almoſt all the books of the Bible, from Geneſis to the Revelation, becauſe he thinks he can prove from certain ſmall paſſages, or circumſtances, in thoſe books, that they were not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by thoſe to whom they have generally been attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Whereas, if this were really the caſe, their authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity might remain; they might ſtill contain a true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of real tranſactions, though the names of the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of them ſhould be found to be different from what they are generally eſteemed to be.—But my limits will not permit me to examine and refute his ſeveral objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. This is ably done by a worthy prelate, whoſe "Apology for the Bible" does honour both to his head and his heart.</p>
            <p>Should the Students of this Univerſity be prompted by curioſity (I hope they will not by an evil heart of unbelief) to read the bold attacks of Thomas Paine upon the authenticity of that book which Chriſtians eſteem ſacred; I take the liberty to recommend as ready a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal of an anſwer by the Biſhop of Landaff. Here you will ſee the Bible defended, and the Chriſtian Religion ſupported, by a decided ſuperiority both of argument
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030426_0015_0FE6D0E8AA3E4520"/>and temper. I had almoſt ſaid, that the ſtriking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt between the diſpoſition of one, who, from early con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the truth of Chriſtianity, had ſpent his life un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the refining and ennobling influence of its divine maxims,—and of one, who had long been a contemner and blaſphemer, is a ſufficient refutation of Paine's prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and vindication of the New Teſtament; it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly demonſtrates the divine excellency of the doctrines, morals, and motives pointed out by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Among the moſt eſſential rights of man, is a freedom of inquiry. This right I would by no means infringe. But ſuffer me to ſay, that if you wiſh for ſpecimens and examples of the moſt indefatigable and extenſive reſearch, of the moſt profound erudition and of the greateſt ſtrength and fairneſs of argumentation, you will not ſtudy deiſtical, in <hi>preference</hi> to Chriſtian writers. In Hume, or in Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, you may be caught by ſubtilty, or captivated by the faſcination of language. But theſe writers have by no means an excluſive claim to elegance and refinement; certainly not to clearneſs and ſtrength of reaſoning, and fairneſs of repreſentation. In a White, a Paley, and a Warſon, beſides innumerable others, you will find con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive argument, and ſolid inſtruction. In the peruſal of theſe you will perceive your underſtanding enlightened and enlarged, without being miſled; your heart com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and eſtabliſhed, without being corrupted; and your nature exalted almoſt to angelick, without enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm. If you would be unhinged in your principles; ſet looſe from all religious reſtraints, and from the controll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influence of a future ſtate of rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; if you would check the energies of the ſoul after perfection, and abandon all hope upon a plan of grace, let the ſcoffers at Chriſtianity be the men of your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel. But if you wiſh to become proficients in miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, in buffoonery, in ſcurrilous abuſe of the beſt characters among men, in profaneneſs againſt the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and in blaſphemy againſt God, read "The Age of Reaſon." But, <hi>bleſſed is the man that walketh not in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the ungodly, nor ſtandeth in the way of ſinners, nor ſitteth in the ſeat of the ſcornful. But who delighteth in the law of the Lord, and meditateth therein day and night.</hi>

If, in the various ramifications of ſociety, the youth are the vigorous and moſt important branches, upon which the expanſion, the ſtrength, and the beauty of the <hi>mighty tree,</hi> in a great meaſure depend, young men of abilities and education may be conſidered as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal tubes and veſſels, which are to convey the vital ſap through the whole. How important is it that theſe veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels ſhould attain their proper maturity and enlargement, and preſerve their proper tone, that the nutrimental juices may be tranſmitted unobſtructed, undiminiſhed, and uncontaminated. The rectitude of the mind, and the purity of the heart, are of much greater conſequence, than ſtrength of underſtanding, or acuteneſs of wit; and much learning without virtue, may make a man mad or miſchievous. While, therefore, in this Seat of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, in this ſeparation from the world, you ſeek and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle with all human wiſdom, you will not neglect <hi>that wiſdom which is from above; which is firſt pure; then peaceable, gentle, and eaſy to be entreated; full of mercy and good fruits; without partiality, and without hypocriſy.</hi> If an acquaintance with the arts and ſciences is eſſential to your reputation as ſcholars; muſt not an acquaintance with yourſelves, and with your Maker, be neceſſary to your preſent tranquillity and uſefulneſs, and to your fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture exaltation and felicity? <hi>Know thyſelf,</hi> is a maxim of one of the ſeven wiſe men. <hi>Acquaint thyſelf with God,</hi> is advice of ſtill greater antiquity and importance. In form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this acquaintance, you will not only ſtudy your own mechaniſm, the mechaniſm of the world, and the hiſtory of Providence; but ſearch the ſcriptures as the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting writings, being adapted to furniſh you thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oughly to every good work, and to make you wiſe unto ſalvation. My concluding, my higheſt wiſh is, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you, nor your friends, nor your country, may ever have occaſion to regret, in any one inſtance among you, time miſpent, or talents miſemployed.</p>
            <p>Among the many pernicious importations from abroad, we may reckon, as none of the leaſt, infidel and atheiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal books, and libertine characters. Thoſe, who have long diſturbed the peace of believers, and endeavoured to turn the chriſtianized and the enlightened world up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide down, are come hither alſo. To counteract the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030426_0017_0FE6D18C66F144D0"/>deadly poiſon of their influence, we ought not to depend wholly upon the ſpecifick antidotes which are ready pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and brought to our hand; but while we grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accept and make uſe of theſe, we ſhould endeavour to acquire the ſkill of preparing other remedies of equal efficacy, though compoſed of the ſame eſſential ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents. For it is to be remembered, that truth, like its great Author, is <hi>the ſame, yeſterday, to-day, and forever;</hi> and the ſubſtantial arguments in ſupport of Chriſtianity, like <hi>the Father of Lights,</hi> are <hi>without variableneſs or ſhadow of change.</hi> Important in this view is the Dudleian Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; which may ſerve as a laboratory, or armoury, where thoſe weapons may be formed and burniſhed, by which to defend the religion of Jeſus, and the rights of Chriſtians. Theſe weapons have hitherto been proof againſt every aſſailant in every attack, in whatever new mode the opponents might uſe their own armour, or bring on the aſſault. The adverſaries of Chriſtianity, like the ſervants of the king of Syria, ſeem to ſay upon every defeat, <hi>Their gods are gods of the hills, therefore they were ſtronger than we; let us fight againſt them in the plain, and ſurely we ſhall overcome them.</hi> They have accordingly ſhifted their ground, and renewed the encounter, in a ſomewhat different manner. But ſtill without ſucceſs. For, "great is the truth, and it will prevail." Greater is he that is in us, than he that is in the world. Their heavieſt artillery of argument has been overpowered, and the thickeſt flights of their envenomed arrows have been broken, or retorted on themſelves. The Chriſtian cauſe ever has been, and ever will be, under the patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the Almighty. The weapons of its defenders are mighty through God. No weapon, therefore, formed againſt it ſhall proſper.</p>
            <p>How aſtoniſhing is the ingratitude of mankind! Some of the greateſt benefactors to the world, have met with the cruelleſt requitals. Many, of whom the world was not worthy, have been ſtoned, have been ſawn aſunder, have been ſlain with the ſword. The Son of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who brought grace and truth from heaven, and who lived and died for the redemption of men, was inſulted, ſpit upon, buffeted, crowned with thorns, and crucified between two thieves: and even to this day there are
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030426_0018_0FE6D18C7243B8B8"/>thoſe who join with his betrayers and murderers, and cry, <hi>Crucify him, crucify him;</hi> and who tread under foot the goſpel, and the blood of the Son of God. While we ſtand aſtoniſhed at the daring blaſphemy of ſome of the enemies of Chriſt and of his religion, let us, his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed friends, revere and ſerve him with the greater aſſiduity; and cultivate the ſpirit of our Maſter, who prayed for his murderers when nailing him to the croſs, <hi>Father forgive them, for they know not what they do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How much reaſon have we to venerate the ſcriptures, and to glory in our religion, notwithſtanding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt that is caſt upon them by men of corrupt minds, whoſe words eat as doth a canker! The doctrines of revelation have ſtood the teſt of the ſevereſt ſcrutiny, and of the fouleſt reproach. When they have been tried they have come forth as gold. The ſuperior and forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble evidences of the truth of Chriſtianity, have carried conviction to the minds of ſome of the greateſt geniuſſes, and moſt learned ſcholars; and the luſtre and divine excellence of its doctrines and morals, have captivated the hearts of multitudes, among whoſe names it would be an honour to have ours enrolled. The apoſtle Paul, with all his erudition and eloquence, even in the polite and learned cities of Athens and Rome, was ſo far from being aſhamed of the goſpel, that he accounted every thing elſe as loſs, for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus his Lord. That which rather gains ſtrength by the manly trial of reaſon, can never be weakened by the inſolence of ridicule. Inſtead therefore of being abaſhed at the ſcoffs of abandoned infidels, let us glory in the undiminiſhed ſtrength of our cauſe, in the ſucceſs of its eſpouſers, and in the honours and triumphs of its Founder. While ſneering unbelievers are lifting the reſtored hand to ſmite their healer; are employing their recovered ſight to extinguiſh the light by which they ſee; and are requiting with death the purchaſer of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal life, let us adhere with the greater ardor to our Redeemer, and hold faſt the confidence of our hope firm unto the end. "<hi>Lord, to whom ſhall we go? Thou haſt the words of eternal life. And we believe and are ſure that Thou art that Chriſt, the Son of the living God.</hi>"</p>
