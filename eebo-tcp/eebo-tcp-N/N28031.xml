            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE birth of an empire to independence and ſovereignty is, to the whole world, an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſting event; intereſting in proportion to the prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able extent of its future connexions, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects this event and theſe connexions will produce, in diſtant climates and remote periods of time.— Few nations, if any, juſtly appreciating the unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ienable rights of human nature, or even their ſelf-intereſt, can ſit unconcerned ſpectators of the mighty ſtruggle for liberty, in which her votaries and children are called, from time to time, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage. Ever ſince the diſcovery of America, its af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs have deeply claimed the attention and been the ſubjects of the policy of the kingdoms of Europe. It needed no more than human wiſdom to foreſee that the vaſt increaſe of population, and acceſs to the hidden ſtores of nature, in a new world, would excite an univerſal ſpirit of enterprize, enlarge the boundaries of ſcience, and expand, to a much broader extent, the wings of active and enriching commerce.—Actuated by theſe views, various nations early made colonial eſtabliſhments in the newly-diſcovered country, which, tho not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037353_0004_100CBE6D4EEA2D20"/>
lucrative, promiſed, at a future period, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent and extenſive advantages. Mutual jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſy between the ſovereigns who claimed the right of ſoil, from diſcovery or conqueſt, and from whoſe dominions ſettlers emigrated to theſe diſtant regions, ſoon aroſe, and a deſire to protect and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the welfare of their infant colonies proved the ſource of rancorous and bloody wars.</p>
            <p>The Britiſh ſettlements in North-America were extenſive, and ſo happily ſituated that they flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed to a degree far ſurpaſſing thoſe of any other nation. They preſented a wide and inviting proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect for emigration and commerce, and ſtreams of opulence, which would naturally increaſe with the progreſs made in the cultivation of the wilderneſs, flowed back and enriched the native country. That they would, at ſome period, arrive to manhood, aſſert their rights and break by violence, the ſhackles of foreign oppreſſion, was perfectly conſiſtent with the natural courſe of human affairs, and early pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted.</p>
            <p>A fundamental error in the principle of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary legiſlation and a ſyſtem perſeveringly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the Britiſh government evidently calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to cramp the genius, repreſs the enterprize, and drain the wealth of the coloniſts, prepared the American mind for the auſpicious event. Every perſon of diſcernment contemplated the conteſt as violent, requiring an immenſe ſacrifice of blood and treaſure; but the object was of ſuch vaſt mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, that no ſacrifice was thought too great, no price too dear, to obtain and ſecure heaven-born liberty.</p>
            <p>To accompliſh a revolution ſo grand and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant as that achieved in our country, it was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary that, in our unorganized ſtate, ſome illuſtrious character ſhould be found, whoſe ſplendid military talents ſhould direct the patriotic
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037353_0005_100CBE6F7ACFE498"/>
ardor and natural energy of his countrymen, and who, by his addreſs, ſhould mould their opinions and conciliate their eſteem.—Then was it that the Divine Director turned the eyes of the guardians of the public welfare to the great, the immortal WASHINGTON.</p>
            <p>That we may improve this ſolemn occaſion to the glory of the living God, and realize the propriety of a national mourning, let us attend to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing conſiderations.</p>
            <p>FIRST. God is the all-wiſe Sovereign of the univerſe and ſupreme arbiter of nations.</p>
            <p>He is the great Lord over all, the Almighty Ruler of the ſkies; ſits enthroned in glory unfad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and crowned with honors everlaſting. His kingdom extends to all worlds and all periods, and his dominion will have no end. With ſway uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troled and power irreſiſtible, He overrules all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents on earth. He hath been and will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and unalterably, carrying on a grand ſcheme, in the whole circle of ſublunary affairs, for his own glory and the good of his church, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the end of time. In the riſe and fall of empires and kingdoms, in the mighty revolutions which occur among nations, in the alternate beams of proſperity and clouds of adverſity which they experience, the ALMIGHTY diſplays his glorious perfections and high ſupremacy. Doth a nation riſe to eminence and greatneſs, ſhine in the arts of peace, or prove ſucceſsful in thoſe of war; or is it caſt down from the zenith of opulence and glory, overtaken with ſad reverſes, and plunged into infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and ruin, the Lord hath done it. When ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the counſels of heaven, great and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intereſting events and revolutions, in the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and government of a country, are about to be accompliſhed, divine wiſdom ever introduces upon the theatre of life, ſuch talents, characters
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037353_0006_100CBE710911A3D8"/>
and concurrence of circumſtances, as are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the completion of the work. Such inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are prepared for the management of public concerns, that the end deſigned will not fail. When the Hebrew tribes were to come up from the land of cruel bondage, MOSES, the ſervant of the Lord, was ſent, with a divine commiſſion, to lead them forth with ſigns and wonders.—When the vaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent of America, which for ages, had been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boſomed in the pathleſs ocean, and lain hidden from the view of the civilized world, was to be diſcovered, COLUMBUS was inſpired with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable ſpirit of foreſight and enterprize, with dauntleſs fortitude to execute his projected ſchemes, and explore unknown ſeas and diſtant regions of the earth.—When the period had arrived that the banners of independence ſhould be unfurled in theſe oppreſſed colonies, a new empire be erected on the broad baſis of rational liberty, and the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States, ſpurning the galling yoke of foreign tyranny, ſhould aſſume a name and rank among ſovereign nations, the ALMIGHTY prepared the il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious WASHINGTON to organize the untutored band and lead the marſhalled battalions to the bloody combat. Extraordinary and ſingularly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inent characters, who ſoar far above the brighteſt of their contemporaries, are not often needed to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the deſigns of Providence. For this end di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power, wiſdom and goodneſs will ever provide fit and adequate inſtruments; but characters with uncommon talents and extent of capacities are not raiſed up, unleſs ſome field is opened for their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play. A ſecond dignified perſonage, tho qualified by the gifts of nature to ſhine with unrivalled luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, like him whoſe exit from time, we this day, as a nation, bemoan, will not obtain equal celebrity, until a ſcene is unfolded for the uſeful exhibition of the ſame ſupereminent talents, which rendered him, ſo juſtly, the glory of his country and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:037353_0007_100CBE748CB8FD10"/>Among all nations, whether more barbarous or more poliſhed, men of military genius have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a vaſt aſcendency in the minds, and received high-ſounding applauſe from the bulk of mankind. The heroic exploits of ſignalized commanders have employed the pen of the hiſtorian, the eloquence of the orator, and the fancy of the poet. Undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed praiſe however, is by no means, juſt. Unleſs directed by moral principle and improved for the good of mankind, eminent talents are aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully deſtructive of human happineſs: Thoſe who poſſeſs them become the curſe of heaven and the ſcourge of the human race.</p>
            <p>The fame of ALEXANDER hath been borne on every wind. Monarchs graced his triumph and extenſive regions owned his ſovereignty. But what were the benefits reſulting to mankind from his might victories, his extenſive conqueſts? He wept that there was not another world to conquer: With much propriety might the world weep at the appearance of another ſuch conqueror!—CAE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAR, at the head of the Roman legions, vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſubdued the numerous and valiant tribes, which ſpread over the wide extent of territory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Rome and Britain. What advantage has been derived from theſe martial achievements?— Great warriors have too often been the butchers of their fellowmen; and the eclat which attended them, has been in proportion to the deſolating havoc which marked their progreſs.</p>
            <p>But when a man endowed by nature with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted genius and evidently formed for great under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, applies it uniformly and with its utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergy, to the ſole benefit of mankind, to the utter excluſion of the idea of private emolument; when he ſtands forth the undaunted champion of liberty, inflexibly determined, at the hazard of every thing dear, to redreſs the grievances of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037353_0008_100CBE7610BC8FA8"/>
raiſe her from the duſt of foreign proſtration, boldly aſſert her rights and maintain her dignity; and, having accompliſhed the great object for which his ſword was drawn, nobly refuſing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which his toils and ſacrifices richly deſerved, retiring from public ſcenes and employments, to the peaceful ſhades of private life; he exhibits a fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed pattern of the Man, the Hero, and the Lover of his country. To him, as an agent in the work of the Lord, ought a tribute of gratitude and praiſe to be returned and beſtowed.</p>
            <p n="2">II. God ſometimes exerciſeth a peculiar provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence toward an oppreſſed people, and by ſignal interpoſitions ſaves them from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and ruin.</p>
            <p>The two moſt remarkable inſtances, in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of the world, to verify this obſervation, are the Jewiſh and American nations.—To reſcue the former from under the deſpotim of Pharaoh, MOSES was eſpecially raiſed up, by a peculiar train of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances educated at the Egyptian court, where a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable opportunity for the improvement of his natural talents was enjoyed; and honored with a commiſſion from heaven, in the terrible diſplay of divine power, to bring them forth from the houſe of bondage. At the red ſea JEHOVAH proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by his wonderful acts, his determination to ſave his choſen people from the hand and cruelty of the proud oppreſſor.—The hiſtory of events, from the cataſtrophe of the red ſea to their entrance upon the promiſed poſſeſſion, is replete with wonders.</p>
            <p>The ſupport of between two and three millions of ſouls, in a barren deſert, for the ſpace of forty years, ſo that their food did not fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>l, nor their cloaths wax old, is one of the moſt ſurprizing and wonder-working providences of which we can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly conceive. The flinty rock muſt guſh with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing ſtreams, the manna muſt deſcend from heaven, and the quails cover the camp, to nouriſh and preſerve the Iſrael of the Lord.</p>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:037353_0009_100CBE784E9110A0"/>When their heaven-guided march was compleat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and the fair inheritance brightened before their eyes, as MOSES, that eminent inſtrument of divine goodneſs to the choſen tribes, was not allowed to go over Jordan, JOSHUA was ordained the organ of divine communication, to lead them to the peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble poſſeſſion.—In providing, according to the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarity of circumſtances, ſuch illuſtrious charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as MOSES and JOSHUA, furniſhing them with ſuch extraordinary qualifications, and enabling them to perform ſuch wonderful deeds, we ſee ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial tokens of the divine preſence and care.</p>
            <p>Clearly manifeſt and little leſs ſignal, was the hand of heaven in the American revolution.—In the conteſt which decided the fate of this empire, on the one hand is ſeen entering the field, a nation poſſeſſed of immenſe wealth; an eſtabliſhed ſyſtem of drawing into effectual energy its ample reſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; a fleet which rode in triumph on the ocean, commanded by officers thoroughly ſkilled in naval affairs and inſpired with the higheſt ſentiments of honor, and manned with ſeamen, who were inured to the havoc of death, and whoſe pulſe beat high for the glory of their king and country; an army; trained in all the terrible diſcipline of war, formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable from its numbers, bold from its ſucceſs, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipt with every neceſſary for the camp and the field, and led by Chiefs adorned with laurels gath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered on the bloody plains of Europe:—On the other, a nation is beheld, ſpread over a wide extent of territory, expoſed on either ſide to hoſtile inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or ſavage incurſion, without an organized ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, or navy, without military ſtores or military knowledge; without officers to command or ſold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iers accuſtomed to the rigor of ſevere diſcipline and ſubordination; deſtitute of every requiſite for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on a war, and having no general government, to ſyſtematize public affairs and wiſely improve the great advantages which the God of Nature had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037353_0010_100CBE79D299EAC8"/>
upon the country.—How ſtriking the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt! Calculating on common principles, how vaſt was the ſuperiority on the ſide of our foes! How awfully portentous the cloud which then gathered over America!—But theſe renowned commanders were captured and the laurels were plucked from their brows, or their proweſs was unavailing; har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy veterans, by thouſands, invaded our ſhores, and either enriched our fields with their blood, or yielded to ſuperior force. Never was Britiſh valor more completely foiled! Never was Britiſh pride ſo deeply humbled as in the loſs of two whole armies in ſo ſhort a term!—When the fabric of independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence tottered to its baſe, when the ſanctuary of lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty was ready to be demoliſhed, when the name of the United States was ready to be blotted out for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and the illuſtrious characters who adorned the revolution to be branded with eternal infamy, the Supreme Sovereign ſaid, Let America be free, and America was free. <hi>"If it had not been the Lord who was on our ſide, when men roſe up againſt us, then they had ſwallowed us up quick, when their wrath was kindled againſt us. Bleſſed be the Lord, who hath not given us a prey to their teeth."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was a particular providence in unfolding the ſcene gradually, in uniting the feelings of a great people in the abhorrence of tyranny, in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the patriots of America willing to run the moſt imminent hazard of property, of fame and of life, and in having ready a choſen inſtrument, with ſome experience and a profound judgment, to execute the divine purpoſe of our political ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—The winds, the waves, the ice, and the floods were made to conſpire to attain the ſame end. In the foreign connexions which we were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to form; in the lively ſympathy of a great and magnanimous monarch, ſince doomed by pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular phrenzy to an untimely fate; in the reſpect and obedience paid through the land to a mere

ſhadow of government, at a time highly favorable for the uncontrollable paſſions of man; in the events of battles; in the almoſt miraculous preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the invaluable life of our heaven honored Hero, and in numerous conſpicuous inſtances, we trace the ſpecial interference of the ALMIGHTY in the eſtabliſhment of our independence and empire.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The moſt eminent and extenſive ſervices to mankind will not ſave from death.</p>
            <p>This relentleſs and inſatiable foe hath triumphed, and will continue to triumph, over the moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated morrals. His dominion is eſtabliſhed over all the race of Adam. The great and the ſmall, the high and the low, the honorable and the deſpiſed, muſt lie down in the grave. MOSES had his taſk aſſigned him in life, his ſphere of uſefulneſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted. The deſigns of heaven in preparing him to act in an extraordinary capacity being accompliſhed, he was removed from time. JOSHUA, his ſucceſſor, acted his part on the theatre of life, in leading the children of Iſrael to the quiet poſſeſſion of the conquered country, and then yielded to the mighty deſtroyer of human kind. The ſame may be ſaid of the moſt affluent, the moſt beloved, the moſt honoured among the ſons of men. Name CRAE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS, SOLOMON, or any even the moſt renowned princes, "the brighteſt ornaments of thrones and of humanity," and it will be found that their earthly career was cloſed by the ſame melancholy event. The grim tyrant aſſaults the ſplendid pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ace with equal boldneſs and with equal ſucceſs, as the humble cottage. He is not diſmayed by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of office, the regalia of courts, the elevation of ranks. Theſe, at a ſingle blow, he levels with the duſt and buries in undiſtinguiſhed ruin. Death aſcends the throne and plunges headlong its high poſſeſſor.—Nay, more than monarchs bow to the fatal ſtroke, for WASHINGTON is fallen!—Let not the greateſt of generals, the moſt eminent of ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,

the moſt highly eſteemed and moſt dearly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved of men, expect to eſcape death, for WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON is fallen! Let not the man "firſt in war, firſt in peace, and firſt in the hearts of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen" hope to avoid the deadly arrow, for WASHINGTON is fallen!—Since the peerleſs trophy obtained on Calvary's mount, have few ſo ſplendid, graced the triumph of the king of terrors! O Death! How numerous, how ſignal are thy victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries! In every age, in every country, in every cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, doſt thou diſplay thy ſable enſigns in ſolemn pomp! Palaces are in thy dominion and kings are thy ſubjects. Thou reigneſt in more complete em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire than the crowned worms of the duſt; to-day, they wield a ſceptre over thouſands and millions of the human race; to-morrow, they bow to thine all-devouring ſword!—Haughty conqueror! Why could not thy fury be appeaſed by the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous victims which are conſtantly ſacrificed at thy ſhrine? Why didſt thou enforce thy claim upon the beloved Father of his country? Why ſpread the mantle of mourning over a nation, over millions, at a ſingle blow?—Never again ſhall ſuch an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity be offered, ſuch an object be preſented to thy dart: And he ſhall riſe and live, when thou art forever deſtroyed by the almighty power of the Prince of Peace.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Men of ſuperior excellence ought, while liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to be reſpected, and, when dead, remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with gratitude.</p>
            <p>Good rulers are a diſtinguiſhed bleſſing. They are the gift of God to any people. The Giver is not to be forgotten becauſe of the greatneſs of the gift.—Talents and virtue, in an high degree, are the great requiſites for thoſe who fill exalted ſtations. Talents, to be uſeful and efficient, muſt be adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the peculiar genius, ſituation and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of a country. Thoſe which, in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play, would entitle to an high ſeat in the temple of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037353_0013_100CBE8127339948"/>
fame, under ſome circumſtances, and in ſome ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſociety, would little conduce, in others, to the ſplendor of high renown. Opportunities for the exhibition of ſuch as claim high and unrivalled pre-eminence do not often occur. Revolutions in politics and government uſually open the wideſt field, and preſent the broadeſt theatre for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and application of all that is rare, great and magnanimous. In trying and dark periods in the ſtate of nations, the world hath been aſtoniſhed, at times, with the view of a reſplendent ſun, burſting from the clouds of obſcurity and beaming with ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient brightneſs in the political horizon. His ſplendors, while they dazzled the eye, have dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed light over the face of community and ſpread joy to thouſands of trembling hearts.—In ſeaſons when tempeſts ſhake the pillars of ancient eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the diſorganization incident to material changes at home clouds the aſpect, talents more original in their nature, and different in their kind, are required, than in ſcenes of public tranquillity, when the ſky is unclouded and the ſun ſhines with luſtre.</p>
            <p>The mariner who, without difficulty or diſhonor, could ſteer the ſhip, when the ſurface of the ocean was ſmooth, the breeze of wind gentle and the noon-day ſun lighting the heavens and the earth, would be driven from the helm, when the face of the great deep was violently convulſed, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in fierce contention, howled, and the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of midnight enveloped the waves and the firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament in impenetrable gloom.</p>
            <p>It is to be obſerved that a univerſal genius, or a man endowed with abilities to conduct, with wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, energy and ſucceſs, civil and military ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangements, is a rare phenomenon. To be crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with laurels won by valor and ſkill in the field of battle, and to ſhine, like the light of heaven, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the celebrated and diſtinguiſhed ſenators of a
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037353_0014_100CBE8359C95568"/>
nation is rarely the lot of any mortal.—Virtue is the guide for the profitable and uſeful improvement of great and ſplendid talents. Miſapplied they reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the ſweeping deluge, the deſtructive tornado or ungovernable flames. They ſpread devaſtation in an hour, which years cannot repair.—How impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant is it, that great men ſhould alſo be good men!</p>
            <p>When a MOSES, a JOSHUA, a DAVID, a SOLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON are exalted to be rulers and legiſlators, they ſhould be honored as choſen of the Lord.—Real merit, without envy or detraction, ſhould receive, from a grateful people, and ample reward. A <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> patriot is a glorious title; add to this <hi>diſintereſted,</hi> and you riſe higher in the ſcale of worth and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. When God removes from earthly ſcenes thoſe who have filled high ſtations with dignity, uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and applauſe, ſuch diſpenſations ought not to paſs unnoticed. They are deeply intereſting to the future welfare of a country. Shall ſingular worth, ſhall the unremitted efforts of the moſt ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing talents for public good, ſhall the moſt noble achievments, the moſt heroic enterprizes be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, the moment the mortal remains of the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors and actors are depoſited in the ſilent vault? Such praiſe-worthy deeds ought to be recorded on the hearts of their countrymen, more laſtingly than on tables of braſs, and the bleſſings enjoyed ſhould ever remind us of the toils, the dangers, and the virtues of thoſe, by whom they were obtained.</p>
            <p>The children of Iſrael teſtified their ſolemn and affectionate remembrance of MOSES by mourning, at his death, thirty days.</p>
            <p>Let us improve the ſubject by the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections.</p>
            <p n="1">1st. God hath deſigned this land for many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant purpoſes of his glory and the good of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:037353_0015_100CBE858BED7398"/>Earthly affairs are controlled by divine wiſdom, power and goodneſs. Great were the preparations made, in the ſtate of the nations, for the glorious appearance of the Meſſiah in the fleſh; and the mighty revolutions of the preſent aera are doubtleſs deſigned as preparatory ſteps to the happy, milen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial ſtate of the Chriſtian church. The whole hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of events ſince the firſt ſettlement of this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, the great things which God hath done for us as a nation, and in ſpecial his kind providence in bleſſing us with "the Hero of the age," are ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teſtimonies and evident preſages that auſpicious and extenſive deſigns are yet in the womb of time. <q>The kingdom is the Lord's, and He is governor among the nations.</q> Our natural and political ſituation opens high and animating proſpects. Our internal reſources are immenſe, and our ſtrength increaſing with ſuch rapidity, that every external preſſure may ſoon be ſet at defiance.</p>
            <p>The ſyſtem of the federal government is new in the annals of the world, combining, beyond any example in ancient or modern times, liberty, order and energy. The freedom of religious enquiry, belief and worſhip, fully enjoyed, removes the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of heavy grievances among ſome nations, and weakens the temptations to infidelity in others. Science diffuſes her benign influence among all claſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of citizens. The enterprizing ſpirit of Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica explores every region and corner of the earth for the acquiſition of wealth, and the bravery of her martial ſons affords the ſtrongeſt hope, that when reſiſtance to foreign foes is neceſſary, by the bleſſing of heaven, it will not be without ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>This land ſeems deſtined by heaven to be an aſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum for the perſecuted and oppreſſed among the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Europe. From the corruption, tyranny and butcheries which deſtroy the greateſt portion

of human felicity on the eaſtern continent, may they fly to theſe hoſpitable ſhores and ſhare in the ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable bleſſings of liberty. The foundation ſeems evidently laid for vaſt improvement <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2d. We learn the mutability of ſublunary things. Statues of braſs are corroded by the gnawing tooth of time; the moſt durable monuments of art crumble to the duſt; crowns fall from the head. Cities looſe their magnificence; empires are bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in the gulph of oblivion; and all earthly glory fades. Can it then be ſurprizing that the moſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, the moſt renowned mortal, ſhould, to day, ſhine in the higheſt ſplendors of the earth, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow lie low at the feet of death? That this may be the caſe our aſſembling in the divine courts this day is a ſolemn proof.</p>
            <p>The Almighty diſpoſer of human events hath commiſſioned death to triumph over WASHINGTON, the father and the ſaviour of his country! A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete delineation of the character, the virtues, the exploits of this highly diſtinguiſhed man, I ſhall not attempt. Even eulogy bluſhes when employed on ſo ſublime a theme and confeſſes that to do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect juſtice is beyond her power. His life and his deeds are the higheſt encomiums which can poſſibly be beſtowed, and the fame of theſe will blazon, till time and earth ſhall be no more. Future Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phons ſhall record his ever-memorable heroiſm; future Homers deſcribe his glowing ardor amidſt embattled hoſts—future Millions invoke the muſe's aid to tune his praiſe, and future Robertſons de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail the battles he fought, the victories he won, the heroes he conquered. Greece ſtands abaſhed, and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037353_0017_100CBE893B85C330"/>
Rome hangs her head; and in future ages, when the poet, the hiſtorian, and the orator have cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated the ſages, the conquerers, the patriots of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, and laviſhed upon them a profuſion of praiſe, the trumpet ſhall ſound ſtill louder the name of WASHINGTON and conclude the liſt.</p>
            <p>The deſcription given above will ſhew the feeble and deſtitute ſituation of the colonies when WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON was appointed commander in chief of their forces. It was ſoon found that the public confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was not miſplaced.</p>
            <p>During the revolutionary war he diſplayed ſuch talents as ſaved his country and aſtoniſhed the world. With great means, great effects may be produced; but to produce great effects, with ſmall means, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires much higher wiſdom. Here the American Hero ſhone, like the ſun in the firmament. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating where a ſtand would have been ruin to the cauſe, even when greatly cenſured; in concealing the real ſtate of his force from his enemies and from his own army; and in various ways, annoying, diſtreſſing and eſcaping the foe, he exhibited con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate prudence and foreſight. Had it not been for the peculiar diſaſters and embarraſſments with which he was neceſſitated to contend, one half of the excellencies of his character, the unſhaken forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his mind, and the wonderful extent of his mental reſources, would not have been known. Trenton and Princeton will ſtand, to the end of time, monuments of his readineſs to ſeize a favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble oppurtunity to attack, of his ſoundneſs of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and military addreſs.—His fame ſoon ſpread beyond the Atlantic and one of the firſt potentates in Europe did not diſdain to place a gallant army under his command.—The independence of his country being eſtabliſhed, like Cincinnatus, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his eminent ſtation, and, accompanied by the plaudits and fervent prayers of millions, retired to the cultivation of his eſtate. Had CAESAR, or
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037353_0018_100CBE8AC212E240"/>
had CROMWELL commanded the army, a military deſpotiſm would have been eſtabliſhed; but WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON's magnanimity was equal to his ſucceſs!</p>
            <p>By the unanimous ſuffrages of his fellow-citizens was he repeatedly called to the preſidency of the United States. At length he retired from public life, fondly hoping to ſpend the evening of his days in that retreat for which he had long and ardently ſighed. A gathering cloud involves the nation in darkneſs and threatens the demolition of the noble fabric cemented by the blood of thouſands; his country again calls; the eye of age brightens into youth, the ſword is drawn; when, lo, the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of death arrives!—He loved his country, he adored the ſupreme Ruler, aſcribing to Him the glory of all ſucceſs; he beheld the great objects for which he embarked upon the tempeſtuous ocean of public life obtained, and, magnanimous and ſerene in death, hath bid the earth adieu.</p>
            <p>WASHINGTON, the pride of America, the glory of the age, now ſleeps in the land of ſilence and of death. The brighteſt ſun in our national horizon is gone down to riſe no more. While to the high mandate of heaven's ſovereign, with humble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, Americans bow, well may they weep! The Hero, the patriot, the ſage; their friend, their benefactor is laid in the duſt. Does a family gath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er around the bed of a fond, a dying parent, and pour out a flood of tears, when the ſolemn hour of parting arrives; and ſhall not the children of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbia weep, when the father of his country lies low? Yes. Let the tear of ſenſibility gliſten in ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery eye. Another ſuch occaſion will never call. Ye war-worn ſoldiers, know that your beloved commander is conſigned to the tomb. Ye aged ſires, know that he, under whom your ſons have fought, and bled, and died, is now no more! Ye vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, teſtify your grief that your friend, your father, your guardian has fled. Let the whole maſs of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

            <p>But let not the hearts of Americans deſpond. A noble and majeſtic pillar in the national fabric is broken, but the corner ſtone is not removed. He who rendered our deplored chief ſo rich a bleſſing, lives forever; and tho' he hath now ſpread dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs about our paths, can eaſily diſpel the cloud and cauſe the ſun to ſhine.—Characters, wiſely ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and worthy of public honors, adorn our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates, dignify our tribunals of juſtice, and fill the executive departments of government.</p>
