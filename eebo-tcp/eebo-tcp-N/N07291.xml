            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>ALL our Actions are of like Nature with their Root; and the Moſt High weigheth them more ſkilfully than Men can weigh them one for another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I believe that one Supreme Being made and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the World; nor can I worſhip any other Deity without being an Idolater, and guilty of Wickedneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Many Nations have believed in, and worſhipped a Plurality of Deities; but I do not believe they were therefore all wicked.—Idolatry indeed is Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs; but it is the Thing, not the Name, which is ſo. Real Idolatry is to pay that Adoration to a Creature, which is known to be due only to the true</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He who profeſſeth to believe in one Almighty Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, and in his Son</hi> JESUS CHRIST, <hi>and is yet more intent on the Honours, Profits and Friendſhips of the World, than he is in Singleneſs of Heart to</hi> ſtand faithful to the Chriſtian Religion, <hi>is in the Channel of Idolatry; while the</hi> Gentile, <hi>who, under ſome miſtaken Opinions, is notwithſtanding eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the true Principle of Virtue, and humbly adores an Almighty Power, may be of that Number who fear</hi> GOD, <hi>and work Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:009314_0003_1030DEF0DCFF7A28"/>
               <hi>I believe the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>aſſumes a Power, that does not belong to any Officer in the Church of</hi> CHRIST; <hi>and if I ſhould knowingly do any Thing, tending to ſtrengthen him in that Capacity, it would be great Iniquity. There are many Thouſands of People, who by their Profeſſion acknowledge him to be the Repreſentative of</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>on Earth; and to ſay that none of them are upright in Heart, would be contrary to my Sentiments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Men who ſincerely apply their Minds to true Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and find an inward Support from above, by which all vicious Inclinations are made ſubject; that they love</hi> GOD <hi>ſincerely, and prefer the real Good of Mankind univerſally to their own private Intereſt; though theſe, through the Strength of Education and Tradition, may remain under ſome ſpeculative and great Errors, it would be uncharitable to ſay, that therefore</hi> GOD <hi>rejects them.—He who creates, ſupports and gives Underſtanding to all Men, his Knowledge and Goodneſs is ſuperior to the various Caſes and Circumſtances of his Creatures, which to as appear the moſt difficult.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Apoſtles and primitive Chriſtians did not cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure all the</hi> Gentiles <hi>as wicked Men,</hi> Rom. ii. 14. Col. iii. 2. <hi>but as they were favoured with a Gift to diſcern Things more clearly, reſpecting the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the true</hi> GOD, <hi>they with much Firmneſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared againſt the worſhiping of Idols; and with true Patience endured many Sufferings, on that Account.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Great Numbers of faithful Proteſtants have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the Truth, in Oppoſition to</hi> Papal <hi>Errors; and with true Fortitude laid down their Lives in
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009314_0004_1030DEF279112180"/>
the Conflict, without ſaying, That no Man was ſaved who made Profeſſion of that Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>While we have no Right to keep Men as Servants for Term of Life, but that of ſuperior Power; to do th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s, with Deſign by their Labour to profit our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and our Families, I believe is wrong; but I do not believe that all who have kept Slaves, have therefore been chargeable with Guilt. If their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives thereto were free from Selfiſhneſs, and their Slaves content, they were a Sort of Freemen; which I believe hath ſometimes been the Caſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whatever a Man does in the Spirit of Charity, to him it is not Sin: And while he lives and acts in this Spirit, he learns all Things eſſential to his Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, as an Individual: And if he doth not ſee that any Injury or Injuſtice, to any other Perſon, is neceſſarily promoted by any Part of his Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, I believe the merciful Judge will not lay Iniquity to his Charge. Yet others, who live in the ſame Spirit of Charity, from a clear Convincement, may ſee the Relation of one Thing to another, and the neceſſary Tendency of each; and hence it may be abſolutely binding on them to deſiſt from ſome Parts of Conduct, which ſome good Men have been in.</hi>

            <p>AS ſome in moſt religious Societies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are concerned in importing or purchaſing the Inhabitants of <hi>Africa</hi> as Slaves; and as the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of Chriſtianity of ſeveral other Nations do the like; theſe Circumſtances tend to make Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple leſs apt to examine the Practice ſo cloſely as they would, if ſuch a Thing had not been, but was now propoſed to be entered upon. It is however our Duty, and what concerns us indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidually, as Creatures accountable to our Creator, to employ rightly the Underſtanding which he hath given us, in humbly endeavouring to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his Will concerning us, and with the Nature and Tendency of thoſe Things which we practiſe: For as Juſtice remains to be Juſtice, ſo many People, of Reputation in the World, joining with wrong Things, do not excuſe others in joining with them, nor make the Conſequence of their Proceedings leſs dreadful in the final Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, than it would be otherwiſe.</p>

               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:009314_0006_103031DC8925A108"/>
WHERE Unrighteouſneſs is juſtified from one Age to another, it is like dark Matter gathering into Clouds over us. We may know that this G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oom will remain till the Cauſe be removed by a Reformation, or Change of Times; and may feel a Deſire, from a Love of Equity, ſo ſpeak on the Occaſion; yet where Error is ſo ſtrong, that it may not be ſpoken againſt without ſome Proſpect of Inconvenience to the Speaker, this Difficulty is likely to operate on our Weakneſs, and quench the good Deſires in us; except we dwell ſo ſteadily under the Weight of it, as to be made willing to <hi>endure Hardneſs</hi> on that Account.</p>
            <p>WHERE Men exert their Talents againſt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces generally accounted ſuch, the ill Effects whereof are preſently perceived in a Government, all Men who regard their own temporal Good, are likely to approve the Work. But when that which is inconſiſtent with perfect Equity, hath the Law, or Countenance of the Great in its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, though the Tendency thereof be quite contrary to the true Happineſs of Mankind in an equal, if not greater, Degree, than many Things accounted reproachful to Chriſtians; yet as theſe ill Effects are not generally perceived, they who labour to diſſuade from ſuch Things, which People believe accord with their Intereſt, have many Difficulties to encounter.</p>
            <p>THE repeated Charges, which GOD gave to his Prophets, imply the Danger they were in of erring on this Hand. <hi>Be not afraid of their Faces; for I am with thee, to deliver thee, faith the Lord,</hi> Jer. i. 8. <hi>Speak all the Words that I
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009314_0007_103031DE52061708"/>
command thee to ſpeak to them; diminiſh not a Word,</hi> Jer. xxvi. 2. <hi>And thou Son of Man, be not afraid of them, nor diſmayed at their Looks. Speak my Words to them, whether they will hear or forbear,</hi> Ezek. ii. 6.</p>
            <p>UNDER an Apprehenſion of Duty, I offer ſome further Conſiderations on this Subject, having endeavoured ſome Years to conſider it candidly. I have obſerved People of our own Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, whoſe Abilities have been inferior to the Affairs which relate to their convenient Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, who have been taken Care of by others, and the Profit of ſuch Work as they could do, applied toward their Support.—I believe there are ſuch amongſt <hi>Negroes;</hi> and that ſome People, in whoſe Hands they are, keep them with no View of outward Profit, do not conſider them as black Men, who, as ſuch, ought to ſerve white Men; but account them Perſons who have Need of Guardians, and as ſuch take Care of them: Yet where equal Care is taken in all Parts of Education, I do not apprehend Caſes of this Sort are likely to occur more frequently amongſt one Sort of People than another.</p>
            <p>IT looks to me that the Slave Trade was founded, and hath generally been carried on, in a wrong Spirit; that the Effects of it are detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to the real Proſperity of our Country; and will be more ſo, except we ceaſe from the common Motives of keeping them, and treat them in future agreeable to Truth and pure Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Negroes</hi> may be imported, who, for their Cruelty to their Countrymen, and the evil Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009314_0008_103031E020F47660"/>
of their Minds, may be unfit to be at Liberty; and if we, as Lovers of Righteouſneſs, undertake the Management of them, we ſhould have a full and clear Knowledge of their Crimes, and of thoſe Circumſtances which might operate in their Favour; but the Difficulty of obtaining this is ſo great, that we have great Reaſon to be cautious therein. But, ſhould it plainly appear that abſolute Subjection were a Condition the moſt proper for the Perſon who is purchaſed, yet the innocent Children ought not to be made Slaves, becauſe their Parents ſinned.</p>
            <p>WE have Account in Holy Scripture of ſome Families ſuffering, where mention is only made of the Heads of the Family committing Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and it is likely that the degenerate <hi>Jews,</hi> miſunderſtanding ſome Occurrences of this Kind, took Occaſion to charge GOD with being unequal; ſo that a Saying became common, <hi>The Fathers have eaten four Grapes, and the Childrens Teeth are ſet on Edge. Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> two of the inſpired Prophets, who lived near the ſame Time, were concerned to correct this Error. <hi>Ezekiel</hi> is large on the Subject. Firſt, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves them for their Error. <hi>What mean ye, that ye do ſo,</hi> Chap. xviii. Verſe 1. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord God, ye ſhall not have Occaſion any more to uſe this Proverb in Iſrael.</hi> The Words, <hi>any more,</hi> have Reference to Time paſt; intimating, that though they had not rightly underſtood ſome Things they had heard or ſeen, and thence ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Proverb to be well grounded; yet henceforth they might know of a Certainty, that
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:009314_0009_103031F1504D7A28"/>
the Ways of GOD are all equal; that as ſure as the Moſt High liveth, ſo ſure Men are only anſwerable for their own Sins.—He thus ſums up the Matter; <hi>The Soul that ſinneth, it ſhall die. The Son ſhall not bear the Iniquity of the Father; neither ſhall the Father bear the Iniquity of the Son. The Righteouſneſs of the Righteous ſhall be upon him; and the Wickedneſs of the Wicked ſhall be upon him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHERE Men are wicked, they commonly are a Means of corrupting the ſucceeding Age; and thereby haſten thoſe outward Calamities, which fall on Nations, when their Iniquities are full.</p>
            <p>MEN may purſue Means which are not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to perfect Purity, with a View to increaſe the Wealth and Happineſs of their Offspring, and thereby make the Way of Virtue more difficult to them. And though the ill Example of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, or a Multitude, does not excuſe a Man in doing Evil, yet the Mind being early impreſſed with vicious Notions and Practices, and nurtured up in Ways of getting Treaſure, which are not the Ways of Truth; this wrong Spirit getting firſt Poſſeſſion, and being thus ſtrengthened, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently prevents due Attention to the true Spirit of Wiſdom, ſo that they exceed in Wickedneſs thoſe before them. And in this Channel, though Parents labour, as they think, to forward the Happineſs of their Children, it proves a Means of forwarding their Calamity. This being the Caſe in the Age next before the grievous Calamity in the Siege of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and carrying <hi>Judah</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to <hi>Babylon,</hi> they might ſay with Propriety, This came upon us, becauſe our Fathers forſook

GOD, and becauſe we did worſe than our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>As the Generation next before them inwardly turned away from GOD, who yet waited to be gracious; and as they in that Age continued in thoſe Things which neceſſarily ſeparated from perfect Goodneſs, growing more ſtubborn, till the Judgments of GOD were poured out upon them; they might properly ſay, <hi>Our Fathers have ſinned, and we have borne their Iniquities:</hi> And yet, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as their Fathers were, had they not ſucceeded them in their Wickedneſs, they had not borne their Iniquities.</p>
            <p>To ſuppoſe it right, that an innocent Man ſhall at this Day be excluded from the common Rules of Juſtice; be deprived of that Liberty, which is the natural Right of human Creatures; and be a Slave to others during Life, on Account of a Sin committed by his immediate Parents; or a Sin committed by <hi>Ham,</hi> the Son of <hi>Noah;</hi> is a Suppoſition too groſs to be admitted into the Mind of any Perſon, who ſincerely deſires to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by ſolid Principles.</p>
            <p>IT is alledged, in Favour of the Practice, that <hi>Joſhua</hi> made Slaves of the <hi>Gibeonites.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT Men do by the Command of GOD, and what comes to paſs as a Conſequence of their Neglect, are different; ſuch as the latter Caſe now mentioned was.</p>
            <p>IT was the expreſs Command of the Almighty to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> concerning the Inhabitants of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Land, <hi>Thou ſhalt make no Covenant with them, nor with their Gods: They ſhall not dwell in
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009314_0011_103031F5E92A7B90"/>
thy Land.</hi> Exod. xxiii. 32. Thoſe <hi>Gibeonites</hi> came craftily, telling <hi>Joſhua,</hi> that they were come from a far Country; that their Elders had ſent them to make a League with the People of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and as an Evidence of their being Foreigners, ſhewed their old Cloaths, &amp;<hi>c. And the Men took of their Victuals, and aſked not Counſel at the Mouth of the Lord; and</hi> Joſhua <hi>made Peace with them, and made a League with them, to let them live; and the Princes ſware to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN the Impoſition was diſcovered, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation murmured againſt the Princes: <hi>But all the Princes ſaid to all the Congregation, we have ſworn to them by the Lord God of Iſrael; now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we may not touch them; we will even let them live, let Wrath be upon us; but let them be Hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Wood, and Drawers of Water unto the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OMITTING to aſk Counſel, involved them in great Difficulty. The <hi>Gibeonites</hi> were of thoſe Cities, of which the LORD ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſave alive nothing that breatheth;</hi> and of the Stock of the <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Thus <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the Princes, not knowing them, had made a League with them, to let them live; and in this Strait they reſolve to make them Servants. <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the Princes ſuſpected them to be De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivers: <hi>Peradventure you dwell amongſt us; and how ſhall we make a League with you?</hi> Which Words ſhew, that they remembered the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

before mentioned; and yet did not enquire at the Mouth of the LORD, as <hi>Moſes</hi> directed <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua,</hi> when he gave him a Charge reſpecting his Duty as chief Man among that People, <hi>Numb.</hi> xxvii. 21. By this Omiſſion Things became ſo ſituated, that <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the Princes could not execute the Judgments of GOD on them, without violating the Oath which they had made.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> did amiſs at the Waters of <hi>Meribah;</hi> and doubtleſs he ſoon repented; for the LORD was with him. And it is likely that <hi>Joſhua</hi> was deeply humbled, under a Senſe of his Omiſſion; for it appears that GOD continued him in his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and ſpared the Lives of thoſe People, for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ake of the League and Oath made in his Name.</p>
            <p>THE Wickedneſs of theſe People was great, and they worthy to die, or perfect Juſtice had not paſſed Sentence of Death upon them; and as their Execution was prevented by this League and Oath, they appear content to be Servants: <hi>As it ſeemeth good and right unto thee to do unto us, do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE Criminals, inſtead of Death, had the Sentence of Servitude pronounced on them, in theſe Words, <hi>Now therefore ye are curſed; and there ſhall none of you be freed from being Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and Hewers of Wood, and Drawers of Water for the Houſe of my God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE find, <hi>Deut.</hi> xx. 10. that there were Cities far diſtant from <hi>Canaan,</hi> againſt which <hi>Iſrael</hi> went to Battle; unto whom they were to proclaim Peace, and if the Inhabitants made Anſwer of Peace, and opened their Gates, they were not to deſtroy them, but make them Tributaries.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:009314_0013_103032BCA5BBB6B8"/>
THE Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were then the LORD's Hoſt, and Executioners of his Judgments on Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple hardened in Wickedneſs.—They were not to go to Battle, but by his Appointment. The Men who were chief in his Army, had their Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the Almighty; ſometimes immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſometimes by the Miniſtry of Angels<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Of theſe, amongſt others, were <hi>Moſes, Joſhua, Othniel,</hi> and <hi>Gideon;</hi> See <hi>Exod.</hi> iii. 2. and xviii. 19. <hi>Joſh.</hi> v. 13. Theſe People far off from <hi>Canaan,</hi> againſt whom <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſent to Battle, were ſo corrupt, that the Creator of the Univerſe ſaw it good to change their Situation; and in caſe of their open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Gates, and coming under Tribute, this their Subjection, though probably more mild than abſolute Slavery, was to laſt little or no longer than while <hi>Iſrael</hi> remained in the true Spirit of Government.</p>
            <p>IT was pronounced by <hi>Moſes</hi> the Prophet, as a Conſequence of their Wickedneſs, <hi>The Stranger that is within thee ſhall get above thee very high<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thou ſhalt come down very low: He ſhall be the Head, and thou the Tail.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS we find in ſome Meaſure verified in their being made Tributaries to the <hi>Moabites, Midian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, Amorites</hi> and <hi>Philiſtines.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is alledged in Favour of the Practice of Slave-keeping, that the <hi>Jews</hi> by their Law made Slaves of the Heathen, <hi>Levit.</hi> xxv. 45. <hi>More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, of the Children of the Stranger that do ſojourn amongſt you, of them ſhall ye buy, and of their Children, which are with you, which they beget in your Land; and they ſhall be your Poſſeſſion; and

you ſhall take them as an Inheritance for your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren after you, to inherit them as a Poſſeſſion, they ſhall be your Bondmen for ever.</hi>—It is difficult for us to have any certain Knowledge of the Mind of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in Regard to keeping Slaves, any other Way than by looking upon him as a true Servant of GOD, whoſe Mind and Conduct were regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by an inward Principle of Juſtice and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. To admit a Suppoſition that he in that Caſe was drawn from perfect Equity by the Alliance of outward Kindred, would be to diſown his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> had Servants born in his Houſe, and bought with his Money: <hi>And the Almighty ſaid of Abraham, I know him, that he will order his Houſe after him.</hi> Which implies, that he was as a Father, an Inſtructor, and a good Governor over his People.—And <hi>Moſes,</hi> conſidered as a Man of GOD, muſt neceſſarily have had a Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of ſome real Advantage in the Strangers and Heathens being Servants to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> for a Time.</p>
            <p>As Mankind had received and eſtabliſhed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny erroneous Opinions and hurtful Cuſtoms, their living and converſing with the <hi>Jews,</hi> while the <hi>Jews</hi> ſtood faithful to their Principles, might be helpful to remove thoſe Errors, and reform their Manners.—But for Men, with private Views, to aſſume an abſolute Power over the Perſons and Properties of others; and continue it from Age to Age in the Line of natural Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without Regard to the Virtues and Vices of their Succeſſors, as it is manifeſtly contrary to true
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009314_0015_1030DEF5A6DB1520"/>
univerſal Love, and attended with great Evils, there requires the cleareſt Evidence to beget a Belief in us, that <hi>Moſes</hi> intended that the Srangers ſhould as ſuch be Slaves to the <hi>Jews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE directed them to buy Strangers and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journers.—It appears that there were Strangers in <hi>Iſrael</hi> who were free Men; and conſidering with what Tenderneſs and Humanity the <hi>Jews,</hi> by their Law, were obliged to uſe their Servants, and what Care was to be taken to inſtruct them in the true Religion, it is not unlikely that ſome Strangers in Poverty and Diſtreſs were willing to enter into Bonds to ſerve the <hi>Jews</hi> as long as they lived; and in ſuch Caſe the <hi>Jews,</hi> by their Law, had a Right to their Service during Life.</p>
            <p>WHEN the Awl was bored through the Ear of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Servant, the Text faith, <hi>He ſhall ſerve for ever;</hi> yet we do not ſuppoſe that by the Word <hi>for ever,</hi> it was intended that none of his Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhould afterwards be free; when it is ſaid in Regard to the Strangers which they bought, <hi>They ſhall be your Poſſeſſion,</hi> it may be well underſtood to mean only the Perſons ſo purchaſed; all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding relates to buying them; and what follows, to the Continuance of their Service. <hi>You ſhall take them as an Inheritance to your Children after you; they ſhall be your Bondmen for ever.</hi> It may be well underſtood to ſtand limited to thoſe they purchaſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes,</hi> directing <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons to waſh their Hands and Feet, when they went into the Tabernacle of the Congregation, faith, <hi>It ſhall be a Statute for ever to them, even to him and his Seed
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009314_0016_1030DEFED16C20F8"/>
throughout all Generations.</hi> And to expreſs the Continuance of the Law, it was his common Language, <hi>It ſhall be a Statute for ever throughout your Generations.</hi> So that had he intended the Poſterity of the Strangers ſo purchaſed to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in Slavery to the <hi>Jews,</hi> it looks likely that he would have uſed ſome Terms clearly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it. The <hi>Jews</hi> undoubtedly had Slaves, whom they kept as ſuch from one Age to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but that this was agreeable to the genuine Deſign of their inſpired Law-giver, is far from being a clear Caſe.</p>
            <p>MAKING Conſtructions of the Law contrary to the true Meaning of it, was common amongſt that People.—<hi>Samuel'</hi>s Sons took Bribes, and perverted Judgment.—<hi>Iſaiah</hi> complained that they juſtified the Wicked for Reward.—<hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaniah,</hi> Cotemporary with <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> on Account of the Injuſtice of the civil Magiſtrates, declared that thoſe Judges were Evening Wolves; and that the Prieſts did Violence to the Law.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeremiah</hi> acquaints us, that the Prieſts cried Peace, Peace, when there was no Peace; by which Means the People grew bold in their Wickedneſs; and having committed Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were not aſhamed; but, through wrong Conſtructions of the Law, they juſtified them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and boaſtingly ſaid, <hi>We are wiſe; and the Law of the Lord is with us.</hi> Theſe Corruptions continued till the Days of our Saviour, who told the <hi>Phariſees, You have made the Commandment of God of none Effect through your Tradition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

THUS it appears that they corrupted the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> nor is it unlikely that among many others this was one; for oppreſſing the Strangers was a heavy Charge againſt the <hi>Jews,</hi> and very often ſtrongly repreſented by the Lord's faithful Prophets.</p>
            <p>THAT the Liberty of Man was, by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Law-giver, eſteemed precious, appears in this; that ſuch who unjuſtly deprived Men of it, were to be puniſhed in like Manner as if they had murdered them. <hi>He that ſtealeth a Man, and ſelleth him; or if he be found in his Hand, ſhall ſurely be put to Death.</hi> This Part of the Law was ſo conſiderable, that <hi>Paul,</hi> the learned <hi>Jew,</hi> giving a brief Account of the Uſes of the Law, adds this, <hi>It was made for Men-ſtealers,</hi> I Tim. i. 10.</p>
            <p>THE great Men amongſt that People were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding oppreſſive; and, it is likely, exerted their whole Strength and Influence to have the Law conſtrued to ſuit their Turns.—The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Servants of the Lord had heavy Work with them in regard to their Oppreſſion; a few In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances follow. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord of Hoſts, the God of Iſrael, amend your Ways, and your Doings; and I will cauſe you to dwell in this Place. If you throughly execute Judgment between a Man and his Neighbour; if you oppreſs not the Stranger, the Fatherleſs and the Widow; and ſhed not inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent blood in this Place; neither walk after other Gods to your Hurt, then will I c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THE King, the Princes and Rulers were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in Oppreſſion before the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; for whatever Courts of Juſtice were retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt them; or however they decided Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters betwixt Men of Eſtates, it is plain that the Cauſe of the Poor was not judged in Equity.</p>
            <p>IT appears that the great Men amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> were fully reſolved to have Slaves, even of their own Brethren, <hi>Jer.</hi> xxxiv. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Promiſes and Threatenings of the LORD, by the Prophet, and their ſolemn Covenant to ſet them free, confirmed by the Imprecation of paſſing between the Parts of a Calf cut in twain; intimating, by that Ceremony, that on Breach of the Covenant, it were juſt for their Bodies to be ſo cut in Pieces,—Yet after all, they held faſt to their old Cuſtom, and called Home the Servants whom they had ſet free.—<hi>And ye were now turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and had done right in my Sight, in proclaiming Liberty every Man to his Neighbour; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Name, and cauſed every Man his Servant, whom he had ſet at Liberty at their Pleaſure, to return, and brought them into Subjection, to be unto you for Servants, and for Handmaids: Therefore thus ſaith the Lord, ye have not hearkened unto me, in proclaiming Liberty every one to his Neighbour, and every one to his Brother. Behold, I proclaim Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to you, ſaith the Lord, to the Sword, to the Peſtilence, and to the Famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the Kingdoms of the Earth.—The Men who tranſgreſſed my Covenant which they made, and paſſed between the Parts of the Calf, I will give into the Hands of their Enemies, and their dead Bodies ſhall be for Meat unto the Fowls of the Heaven, and the Beaſts of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SOON after this their City was taken and burnt; the King's Sons and the Princes ſlain; and the King with the chief Men of his Kingdom, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Captive to <hi>Babylon.—Ezekiel,</hi> propheſying the Return of that People to their own Land, directs, <hi>Ye ſhall divide the Land by Lot, for an Inheritance unto you, and to the Strangers that ſojourn amongſt you; in what Tribe the Stranger ſojourns, there ſhall ye give him his Inheritance, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> Nor is this particular Direction, and the Authority with which it is enforced, without a tacit Implication, that their Anceſtors had erred in their Conduct towards the Stranger.</p>
            <p>SOME who keep Slaves, have doubted as to the Equity of the Practice; but as they knew Men, noted for their Piety, who were in it, this, they ſay, has made their Minds eaſy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:009314_0020_1030DF0ED50E4628"/>
To lean on the Example of Men in doubtful Caſes, is difficult: For only admit, that thoſe Men were not faithful and upright to the higheſt Degree, but that in ſome particular Caſe they erred, and it may follow that this one Caſe was the ſame, about which we are in Doubt; and to quiet our Minds by their Example, may be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to ourſelves; and continuing in it, prove a Stumbling-block to tender-minded People who ſucceed us, in like Manner as their Examples are to us.</p>
            <p>BUT ſuppoſing Charity was their only Motive, and they not foreſeeing the Tendency of paying Robbers for their Booty, were not juſtly under the Imputation of being Partners with a Thief, <hi>Prov.</hi> xxix. 24. but were really innocent in what they did, are we aſſured that we keep them with the ſame Views they kept them? If we keep them from no other Motive than a real Senſe of Duty, and true Charity governs us in all our Proceedings toward them, we are ſo far ſafe: But if another Spirit, which inclines our Minds to the Ways of this World, prevail upon us, and we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for our own outward Gain more than for their real Happineſs, it will avail us nothing that ſome good Men have had the Care and Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Negroes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SINCE Mankind ſpread upon the Earth, many have been the Revolutions attending the ſeveral Families, and their Cuſtoms and Ways of Life different from each other. This Diverſity of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, though ſome are preferable to others, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates not in Favour of any, ſo far as to juſtify them
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:009314_0021_1030DF1067E91A20"/>
to do Violence to innocent Men; to bring them from their own to another Way of Life. The Mind, when moved by a Principle of true Love, may feel a Warmth of Gratitude to the univerſal Father, and a lively Sympathy with thoſe Nations, where Divine Light has been leſs manifeſt.</p>
            <p>THIS Deſire for their real Good may beget a Willingneſs to undergo Hardſhips for their Sakes, that the true Knowledge of GOD may be ſpread amongſt them: But to take them from their own Land, with Views of Profit to ourſelves, by Means inconſiſtent with pure Juſtice, is foreign to that Principle which ſeeks the Happineſs of the whole Creation. Forced Subjection, on innocent Perſons of full Age, is inconſiſtent with right Reaſon; on one Side, the human Mind is not naturally forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with that Firmneſs in Wiſdom and Goodneſs, neceſſary to an independent Ruler; on the other Side, to be ſubject to the uncontroulable Will of a Man, liable to err, is moſt painful and afflicting to a conſcientious Creature.</p>
            <p>IT is our Happineſs faithfully to ſerve the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Being, who made us: His Perfection makes our Service reaſonable; but ſo long as Men are bluffed by narrow Self-love, ſo long an abſolute Power over other Men is unfit for them.</p>
            <p>MEN, taking on them the Government of others, may intend to govern reaſonably, and make their Subjects more happy than they would be otherwiſe; but, as abſolute Command belongs only to him who is perfect, where frail Men, in their own Wills, aſſume ſuch Command, it hath
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:009314_0022_1030DF12026DEED8"/>
a direct Tendency to vitiate their Minds, and make them more unfit for Government.</p>
            <p>PLACING on Men the ignominious Title SLAVE, dreſſing them in uncomely Garments, keeping them to ſervile Labour, in which they are often dirty, tends gradually to fix a Notion in the Mind, that they are a Sort of People below us in Nature, and leads us to conſider them as ſuch in all our Concluſions about them. And, moreover, a Perſon which in our Eſteem is mean and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, if their Language or Behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward us is unſeemly or diſreſpectful, it excites Wrath more powerfully than the like Conduct in one we accounted our Equal or Superior; and where this happens to be the Caſe, it diſqualifies for candid Judgment; for it is unfit for a Perſon to ſit as Judge in a Caſe where his own perſonal Reſentments are ſtirred up; and, as Members of Society in a well framed Government, we are mutually dependant. Preſent Intereſt incites to Duty, and makes each Man attentive to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of others; but he whoſe Will is a Law to others, and can enforce Obedience by Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he whoſe Wants are ſupplied without feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Obligation to make equal Returns to his Benefactor, his irregular Appetites find an open Field for Motion, and he is in Danger of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard, and inattentive to their Convenience who labour for his Support; and ſo loſes that Diſpoſition, in which alone Men are fit to govern.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government hath been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by candid Foreigners for the Diſuſe of Racks and Tortures, ſo much practiſed in ſome
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:009314_0023_1030DF1A5D9C98D0"/>
States; but this multiplying Slaves now leads to it; for where People exact hard Labour of others, without a ſuitable Reward, and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to continue in that Way, Severity to ſuch who oppoſe them becomes the Conſequence; and ſeveral <hi>Negroe</hi> Criminals, among the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> have been executed in a lingering, painful Way, very terrifying to others.</p>
            <p>IT is a happy Caſe to ſet out right, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in the ſame Way: A wrong Beginning leads into many Difficulties; for to ſupport one Evil, another becomes cuſtomary; two produces more; and the further Men proceed in this Way, the greater their Dangers, their Doubts and Fears<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the more painful and perplexing are their Circumſtances; ſo that ſuch who are true Friends to the real and laſting Intereſt of our Country, and candidly conſider the Tendency of Things, cannot but feel ſome Concern on this Account.</p>
            <p>THERE is that Superiority in Men over the Brute Creatures, and ſome of them ſo manifeſtly dependant on Men for a Living, that for them to ſerve us in Moderation, ſo far as relates to the right Uſe of Things, looks conſonant to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of our Creator.</p>
            <p>THERE is nothing in their Frame, nothing relative to the propagating their Species, which argues the contrary; but in Men there is. The Frame of Mens Bodies, and the Diſpoſition of their Minds are different; ſome, who are tough and ſtrong, and their Minds active, chuſe Ways of Life requiring much Labour to ſupport them;

               </gap>l than others, and their Minds leſs ſprightly. Theſe latter labouring for their Subſiſtance, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly chuſe a Life eaſy to ſupport, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with a little. When they are weary they may reſt, take the moſt advantageous Part of the Day for Labour; and in all Caſes proportion one Thing to another, that their Bodies be not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
            <p>Now, while each is at Liberty, the latter may be as happy, and live as comfortably as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; but where Men of the firſt Sort have the latter under abſolute Command, not conſidering the Odds in Strength and Firmneſs, do, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, in their eager Purſuit, lay on Burthens grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to be borne; by Degrees grow rigorous, and, aſpiring to Greatneſs, they increaſe Oppreſſion, and the true Order of kind Providence is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted.</p>
            <p>THERE are Weakneſſes ſometimes attending us, which make little or no Alteration in our Countenances, nor much leſſen our Appetite for Food, and yet ſo affect us, as to make Labour ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uneaſy. In ſuch Caſe Maſters, intent on putting forward Buſineſs, and jealous of the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of their Slaves, may diſbelieve what they ſay, and grievouſly afflict them.</p>
            <p>ACTION is neceſſary for all Men, and our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſting Frame requires a Support, which is the Fruit of Action. The Earth muſt be laboured to keep us alive: Labour is a proper Part of our Life; to make one anſwer the other in ſome

uſeful Motion, looks agreeable to the Deſign of our Creator. Motion, rightly managed, tends to our Satisfaction, Health and Support.</p>
            <p>THOSE who quit all uſeful Buſineſs, and live wholly on the Labour of others, have their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Thus, while ſome are divers Ways diſtreſſed for Want of an open Channel of uſeful Action, thoſe who ſupport them ſigh, and are exhauſted in a Stream too powerful for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſpending their Days with too little Ceſſation from Labour.</p>
            <p>SEED ſown with the Tears of a confined op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed People, Harveſt cut down by an overborne diſcontented Reaper, makes Bread leſs ſweet to the Taſte of an honeſt Man, than that which is the Produce, or juſt Reward of ſuch voluntary Action, which is one proper Part of the Buſineſs of human Creatures.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, the weak State of the human Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, in bearing and bringing forth their Young, and the helpleſs Condition of their Young be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond that of other Creatures, clearly ſhew that <hi>Perfect Goodneſs</hi> deſigns a tender Care and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard ſhould be exerciſed toward them; and that no imperfect, arbitrary Power ſhould prevent the cordial Effects of that Sympathy, which is, in the Minds of well-met Pairs, to each other, and toward their Offspring.</p>
            <p>IN our Species the mutual Ties of Affection are more rational and durable than in others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low

us; the Care and Labour of raiſing our Offspring much greater. The Satisfaction ariſing to us in their innocent Company, and in their Advances from one rational Improvement to another, is conſiderable, when two are thus joined, and their Affections ſincere; it however happens among Slaves, that they are often ſituate in different Places; and their ſeeing each other depends on the Will of Men, liable to human Paſſions, and a Byas in Judgment; who, with Views of Self-intereſt, may keep them apart more than is right. Being abſent from each other, and often with other Company, there is a Danger of their Affections being alienated, Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies ariſing, the Happineſs otherwiſe reſulting from their Offspring fruſtrated, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Marriage deſtroyed.—Theſe Things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſidered cloſely, as happening to a near Friend, will appear to be hard and painful.</p>
            <p>HE who reverently obſerves that Goodneſs manifeſted by our Gracious Creator toward the various Species of Beings in this World, will ſee, that in our Frame and Conſtitution is clearly ſhewn that innocent Men, capable to manage for themſelves, were not intended to be Slaves.</p>
            <p>A PERSON lately travelling amongſt the <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes</hi> near <hi>Senegal,</hi> hath this Remark; <q>Which Way ſoever I turned my Eyes on this pleaſant Spot, I beheld a perfect Image of pure Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; an agreeable Solitude, bounded on every Side by charming Landſkips, the rural Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Cottages in the Midſt of Trees. The Eaſe and Indolence of the <hi>Negroes</hi> reclined
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:009314_0027_1030DF28E2DB4760"/>
under the Shade of their ſpreading Foliage; the Simplicity of their Dreſs and Manners; the Whole revived in my Mind the Idea of our firſt Parents, and I ſeemed to contemplate the World in its primitive State.</q> 
               <hi>M. Adanſon,</hi> Page 55.</p>
            <p>SOME <hi>Negroes</hi> in theſe Parts, who have had an agreeable Education, have manifeſted a Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Underſtanding equal to many of us. A Remark of this Kind we find in <hi>Boſman,</hi> Page 328. <q>The <hi>Negroes</hi> of <hi>Fida,</hi> ſaith he, are ſo accurately quick in their Merchandize Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, that they eaſily reckon as juſtly and quickly in their Heads only, as we with the Aſſiſtance of Pen and Ink, though the Sum amounts to ſeveral Thouſands.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THROUGH the Force of long Cuſtom, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears needful to ſpeak in Relation to Colour.—Suppoſe a white Child, born of Parents of the meaneſt Sort, who died and left him an Infant, falls into the Hands of a Perſon, who endeavours to keep him a Slave, ſome Men would account him an unjuſt Man in doing ſo, who yet appear eaſy while many Black People, of honeſt Lives, and good Abilities, are enſlaved, in a Manner more ſhocking than the Caſe here ſuppoſed. This is owing chiefly to the Idea of Slavery being connected with the Black Colour, and Liberty with the White:—And where falſe Ideas are twiſted into our Minds, it is with Difficulty we get fairly diſentangled.</p>
            <p>A TRAVELLER, in cloudy Weather, miſſeth his Way, makes many Turns while he is loſt; ſtill
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:009314_0028_1030DF2A7B687B18"/>
forms in his Mind the Bearing and Situation of Places, and though the Ideas are wrong, they fix as faſt as if they were right. Finding how Things are, we ſee our Miſtake; yet the Force of Reaſon, with repeated Obſervations on Places and Things, do not ſoon remove thoſe falſe Notions, ſo faſtened upon us, but it will ſeem in the Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as if the annual Courſe of the Sun was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered; and though, by Recollection, we are aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured it is not, yet thoſe Ideas do not ſuddenly leave us.</p>
            <p>SELFISHNESS being indulged, clouds the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; and where ſelfiſh Men, for a long Time, proceed on their Way, without Oppoſition, the Deceiveableneſs of Unrighteouſneſs gets ſo rooted in their Intellects, that a candid Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Things relating to Self-intereſt is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; and in this Circumſtance, ſome who would not agree to make a Slave of a Perſon whoſe Colour is like their own, appear eaſy in making Slaves of others of a different Colour, though their Underſtandings and Morals are equal to the Generality of Men of their own Colour.</p>
            <p>THE Colour of a Man avails nothing, in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Right and Equity. Conſider Colour in Relation to Treaties; by ſuch, Diſputes betwixt Nations are ſometimes ſettled. And ſhould the Father of us all ſo diſpoſe Things, that Treaties with black Men ſhould ſometimes be neceſſary, how then would it appear amongſt the Princes and Ambaſſadors, to inſiſt on the Prerogative of the white Colour?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:009314_0029_1030DF2C13018638"/>
WHENCE is it that Men, who believe in a righteous Omnipotent Being, to whom all Nations ſtand equally related, and are equally accountable, remain ſo eaſy in it; but for that the Ideas of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes</hi> and Slaves are ſo interwoven in the Mind, that they do not diſcuſs this Matter with that Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour and Freedom of Thought, which the Caſe juſtly calls for?</p>
            <p>To come at a right Feeling of their Condition, requires humble ſerious Thinking; for, in their preſent Situation, they have but little to engage our natural Affection in their Favour.</p>
            <p>HAD we a Son or a Daughter involved in the ſame Caſe, in which many of them are, it would alarm us, and make us feel their Condition with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeking for it. The Adverſity of an intimate Friend will incite our Compaſſion, while others, equally good, in the like Trouble, will but little affect us.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, the Man in worldly Honour, whom we conſider as our Superior, treating us with Kindneſs and Generoſity, begets a Return of Gratitude and Friendſhip toward him. We may receive as great Benefits from Men a Degree low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than ourſelves, in the common Way of reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and feel ourſelves leſs engaged in Favour of them. Such is our Condition by Nature; and theſe Things being narrowly watched and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, will be found to center in Self-love.</p>
            <p>THE Blacks ſeem far from being our Kinsfolks, and did we find an agreeable Diſpoſition and ſound Underſtanding in ſome of them, which appeared as a good Foundation for a true Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:009314_0030_1030DF2F6EB0AEB8"/>
between us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Diſgrace ariſing from an open Friendſhip with a Perſon of ſo vile a Stock, in the common Eſteem, would naturally tend to hinder it.—They have neither Honours, Riches, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Magnificence nor Power; their Dreſs coarſe, and often ragged; their Employ Drudgery, and much in the Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>: They have little or nothing at Command; but muſt wait upon and work for others, to obtain the Neceſſaries of Life; ſo that, in their preſent Situation, there is not much to engage the Friendſhip, or move the Affection of ſelfiſh Men: But ſuch who live in the Spirit of true Charity, to ſympathiſe with the Afflicted in the loweſt Stations of Life, is a Thing familiar to them.</p>
            <p>SUCH is the Kindneſs of our Creator, that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, applying their Minds to ſound Wiſdom, may, in general, with moderate Exerciſe, live comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, where no miſapplied Power hinders it.—We in theſe Parts have Cauſe gratefully to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge it. But Men leaving the true Uſe of Things, their Lives are leſs calm, and have leſs of real Happineſs in them.</p>
            <p>MANY are deſirous of purchaſing and keeping Slaves, that they may live in ſome Meaſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to thoſe Cuſtoms of the Times, which have in them a Tincture of Luxury; for when we, in the leaſt Degree, depart from that Uſe of the Creatures, which the Creator of all Things intended for them, there Luxury begins.</p>
            <p>AND if we conſider this Way of Life ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, we ſhall ſee there is nothing in it ſufficient to induce a wiſe Man to chuſe it, before a plain,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:009314_0031_1030DF3454D93820"/>
ſimple Way of living. If we examine ſtately Buildings and Equipage, delicious Food, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine Cloaths, Silks and Linens; if we conſider the Splendour of choice Metal faſtened upon Raiment, and the moſt ſhowy Inventions of Men, it will yet appear that the humble-minded Man, who is contented with the true Uſe of Houſes, Food and Garments, and chearfully exerciſeth himſelf agreeable to his Station in Civil Society, to earn them, acts more reaſonably, and diſcovers more Soundneſs of Underſtanding in his Conduct, than ſuch who lay heavy Burdens on others, to ſupport themſelves in a luxurious Way of living.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>George Buchanan,</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Page 62, tells of ſome ancient Inhabitants of <hi>Britain,</hi> who were derived from a People that <q>had a Way of marking their Bodies, as ſome ſaid, with Inſtruments of Iron, with Variety of Pictures, and with Animals of all Shapes, and wear no Garments, that they ſhould not hide their Pictures; and were therefore called <hi>Picts.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>DID we ſee thoſe People ſhrink with Pain, for a conſiderable Time together, under the Point or Edge of this Iron Inſtrument, and their Bodies all bloody with the Operation; did we ſee them ſometimes naked, ſuffering with Cold, and refuſe to put on Garments, that thoſe imaginary Enſigns of Grandeur might not be concealed, it is likely we ſhould pity their Folly, and Fondneſs for thoſe Things: But if we candidly compare their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, in that Caſe, with ſome Conduct amongſt
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:009314_0032_1030DF39326D31E8"/>
ourſelves, will it not appear that our Folly is the greateſt?</p>
            <p>IN true Goſpel Simplicity, free from all wrong Uſe of Things, a Spirit which breathes Peace and good Will is cheriſhed; but when we aſpire after imaginary Grandeur, and apply to ſelfiſh Means to attain our End, this Deſire, in its Original, is the ſame with the <hi>Piots</hi> in cutting Figures on their Bodies; but the evil Conſequences attending our Proceedings are the greateſt.</p>
            <p>A COVETOUS Mind, which ſeeks Opportunity to exalt itſelf, is a great Enemy to true Harmony in a Country: Envy and Grudging uſually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company this Diſpoſition, and it tends to ſtir up its Likeneſs in others. And where this Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſeth ſo high, as to embolden us to look upon honeſt induſtrious Men as our own Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty during Life, and to keep them to hard Labour, to ſupport us in thoſe Cuſtoms which have not their Foundation in right Reaſon; or to uſe any Means of Oppreſſion, a haughty Spirit is cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on one Side, and the Deſire of Revenge fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently on the other, till the Inhabitants of the Land are ripe for great Commotion and Trouble; and thus Luxury and Oppreſſion have the Seeds of War and Deſolation in them.</p>

            <head>Some Account of the SLAVE-TRADE, From the Writings of Perſons who have been at the Places where they are firſt purchaſed, viz.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>BOSMAN</hi> on <hi>Guiney,</hi> who was a Factor for the <hi>Dutch</hi> about ſixteen Years in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try (Page 339) thus remarks: <q>But ſince I have ſo often mentioned that Commerce, I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe how it is managed by our Factors. The firſt Buſineſs of one of our Factors, when he comes to <hi>Fida,</hi> is to ſatisfy the Cuſtoms of the King, and the great Men, which amounts to about <hi>One Hundred Pounds,</hi> in <hi>Guiney</hi> Value, as the Goods muſt ſell there. After which we have free Licence to trade, which is publiſhed throughout the whole Land by the Cryer. And yet before we can deal with any Perſon, we are obliged to buy the King's whole Stock of Slaves, at a ſet Price; which is commonly one Third or Fourth higher than ordinary. After which, we have free Leave to deal with all his Subjects, of what Rank ſoever. But if there happen to be no Stock of Slaves, the Factor muſt reſolve to run the Riſk of truſting the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants with Goods, to the Value of One or Two Hundred Slaves; which Commodities they ſend into the Inland Country, in order to buy with them Slaves at all Markets, and that ſometimes Two Hundred Miles deep in the Country: For you ought to be informed, that Markets of Men are here kept in the ſame Manner as they of Beaſts are with us.</q>

               <p>MOST of the Slaves which are offered to us, are Priſoners of War, which are ſold by the Victors as their Booty.—When theſe Slaves come to <hi>Fida,</hi> they are put in Priſons all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and when we treat concerning them, they are all brought out in a large Plain, where, by our Surgeons, whoſe Province it is, they are thoroughly examined, even to the ſmalleſt Member, and that naked, both Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, without the leaſt Diſtinction or Modeſty. Thoſe which are approved as good, are ſet on one Side. The Invalids and Maimed being thrown out, the Remainder are numbered, and it is entered who delivered them: In the mean while a burning Iron, with the Arms or Name of the Company, lies in the Fire, with which ours are marked on the Breaſt. This is done, that we may diſtinguiſh them from the Slaves of the <hi>Engliſh, French,</hi> or others. When we have agreed with the Owners of the Slaves, they are returned to their Priſons, where, from that Time forward, they are kept at our Charge, coſt us <hi>Two-pence</hi> a Day a Slave, which ſerves to ſubſiſt them, like our Criminals, on Bread and Water: So that, to ſave Charges, we ſend them on board our Ships the firſt Opportunity; before which their Maſters ſtrip them of all they have on their Backs, ſo that they come a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board ſtark naked, as well Women as Man, in which Condition they are obliged to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, if the Maſter of the Ship is not ſo chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table (which he commonly is) as to beſtow ſomething on them, to cover their Nakedneſs.</p>

               <q>IT is now Time (ſaith the ſame Author) to ſpeak of a brutiſh Cuſtom theſe People have amongſt them, in making Slaves; which I take not to be lawful for any Perſon of a good Conſcience to buy.</q>—</p>
            <p>HE then deſcribes how Women betray Men into Slavery, and adds, <q>There are others going

up into the Inland Country, and through Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Juriſdiction, ſeize Men upon any tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling Offence, and ſell them for Slaves. P. 537.</q>

            <p>THE Author of this Treatiſe, converſing with a Perſon of good Credit, was informed by him, that in his Youth, while in <hi>England,</hi> he was minded to come to <hi>America,</hi> and happening on a Veſſel bound for <hi>Guiney,</hi> and from thence into <hi>America,</hi> he, with a View to ſee <hi>Africa,</hi> went on board her, and continued with them in their Voyage, and ſo came into this Country. Among other Circumſtances he related theſe. <q>They purchaſed on the Coaſt about Three Hundred Slaves; ſome of them he underſtood were Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of War; ſome ſtolen by other <hi>Negroes</hi> privately.—When they had got many Slaves on board, but were ſtill on that Coaſt, a Plot was laid by an old <hi>Negroe,</hi> notwithſtanding the Men had Irons on their Hands and Feet, to kill the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and take the Veſſel; which being diſcovered, the Man was hanged, and many of the Slaves made to ſhoot at him as he hung up.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>Another Slave was charged with having a Deſign to kill the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and the Captain ſpoke to him in Relation to the Charge brought againſt him, as he ſtood on Deck; whereupon he immediately threw himſelf into the Sea, and was drowned.</p>
               <p>SEVERAL <hi>Negroes,</hi> confined on board, were, he ſaid, ſo extremely uneaſy with their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, that after many Endeavours uſed, they could never make them eat nor drink after
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:009314_0038_1030DF4B9097AE40"/>
they came in the Veſſel; but in a deſperate Reſolution ſtarved themſelves to Death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>having toward the laſt like Mad-men.</p>
            </q>
            <p>IN <hi>Randall'</hi>s Geography, printed 1744, we are informed, <q>That in a Time of full Peace no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more common than for the <hi>Negroes</hi> of one Nation to ſteal thoſe of another, and ſell them to the <hi>Europeans.</hi> It is thought that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> tranſmit annually near Fifty Thouſand of theſe unhappy Creatures; and the other <hi>European</hi> Nations together, about Two Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Thouſand more.</q>

            <p>IT is through the Goodneſs of GOD that the Reformation from groſs Idolatry and Barbarity hath been thus far effected; if we conſider our Conditions as Chriſtians, and the Benefits we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, and compare them with the Condition of thoſe People, and conſider that our Nation trad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them for their Country Produce, have had an Opportunity of imparting uſeful Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to them, and remember that but little Pains have been taken therein, it muſt look like an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference in us.—But when we reflect on a Cuſtom the moſt ſhocking of any amongſt them, and remember that, with a View to outward Gain, we have joined as Parties in it; that our Concurrence with them in their barbarous Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, has tended to harden them in Cruelty, and been a Means of increaſing Calamities in their Country, we muſt own that herein we have acted contrary to thoſe Worthies whoſe Lives and Subſtance were ſpent in propagating Truth and Righteouſneſs amongſt the Heathen.

When <hi>Saul,</hi> by the Hand of <hi>Doeg,</hi> ſlew Four Score Prieſts at once, he had a Jealouſy that one of them at leaſt was confederate with <hi>David,</hi> whom he conſidered as his Enemy.—<hi>Herod</hi> ſlaying all the Male Children in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> of two Years old and under, was an Act of uncommon Cruelty; but he ſuppoſed there was a Male Child there, within that Age, who was likely to be King of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and finding no Way to deſtroy him, but by deſtroying them all, thought this the moſt effectual Means to ſecure the Kingdom to his own Family.</p>
            <p>WHEN the Sentence againſt the Proteſtants of <hi>Marindol,</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>France,</hi> was put in Execution, great Numbers of People fled to the Wilderneſs; amongſt whom were ancient People, Women great with Child, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Foxe'<hi>s Acts and Monuments,</hi> Page 646.</p>
            <p>IN Favour of thoſe Cruelties, every one had what they deemed a Plea.—Theſe Scenes of Blood and Cruelty among the barbarous Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Guiney,</hi> are not leſs terrible than thoſe now mentioned. They are continued from one Age to another, and we make ourſelves Parties and Fellow-helpers in them; nor do I ſee that
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:009314_0040_1030DF5577EEAE08"/>
we have any Plea in our Favour more plauſible than the Plea of <hi>Soul,</hi> of <hi>Herod,</hi> or the <hi>French</hi> in thoſe Slaughters.</p>
            <p>MANY who are Parties in this Trade, by keeping Slaves with Views of Self-intereſt, were they to go as Soldiers in one of theſe Inland Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions to catch Slaves, they muſt neceſſarily grow diſſatisfied with ſuch Employ, or ceaſe to profeſs their religious Principles. And though the firſt and moſt ſtriking Part of the Scene is done at a great Diſtance, and by other Hands, yet every one who is acquainted with the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and notwithſtanding joins in it for the Sake of Gain only, muſt, in the Nature of Things, be chargeable with the others.</p>
            <p>SHOULD we conſider ourſelves preſent as Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, when cruel <hi>Negroes</hi> privately catch inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Children, who are employed in the Fields; hear their lamentable Cries, under the moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifying Apprehenſions; or ſhould we look upon it as happening in our own Families, having our Children carried off by Savages, we muſt needs own, that ſuch Proceedings are contrary to the Nature of Chriſtianity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Should we meditate on the Wars which are greatly increaſed by this Trade, and on that Affliction which many Thouſands live in, through Apprehenſions of being taken or ſlain; on the Terror and Amazement that Villages are in, when ſurrounded by theſe Troops of Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſers; on the great Pain and Miſery of groaning dying Men, who get wounded in thoſe Skirmiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, we ſhall neceſſarily ſee, that it is impoſſible
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:009314_0041_1030DF570E39C4F8"/>
to be Parties in ſuch a Trade, on the Motives of Gain and retain our Innocence.</p>
            <p>SHOULD we conſider the Caſe of Multitudes of thoſe People, who in a fruitful Soil, and hot Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, with a little Labour, raiſe Grain, Roots and Pulſe, to eat; ſpin and weave Cotton, and faſten together the large Feathers of Fowls, to cover their Nakedneſs; many of whom, in much Simplicity, live inoffenſive in their Cottages, and take great Comfort in raiſing up Children.</p>
            <p>SHOULD we contemplate on their Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, when ſuddenly attacked, and labour to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand their inexpreſſible Anguiſh of Soul, who ſurvive the Conflict<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould we think on inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Women, who fled at the Alarm, and at their Return ſaw that Village, in which they and their Acquaintance were raiſed up, and had pleaſantly ſpent their youthful Days, now lying in a gloomy Deſolation; ſome ſhocked at finding the mangled Bodies of their near Friends amongſt the Slain; others bemoaning the Abſence of a Brother, a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, a Child, or a whole Family of Children, who, by cruel Men, are bound and carried to Market, to be ſold, without the leaſt Hopes of ſeeing them again: Add to this, the afflicted Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of theſe poor Captives, who are ſeparated from Family Connections, and all the Comforts ariſing from Friendſhip and Acquaintance, carried amongſt a People of a ſtrange Language, to be parted from their Fellow Captives, put to Labour in a Manner more ſervile and weariſome than what they were uſed to, with many ſorrowful Circumſtances attending their Slavery; and we
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:009314_0042_1030DF5F02EE59D8"/>
muſt neceſſarily ſee, that it belongs not to the Followers of CHRIST to be Parties in ſuch a Trade, on the Motives of outward Gain.</p>
            <p>THOUGH there were Wars and Deſolations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Negroes,</hi> before the <hi>Europeans</hi> began to trade there for Slaves, yet now the Calamities are greatly increaſed, ſo many Thouſands being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually brought from thence; and we, by pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing them, with Views of Self-intereſt, are become Parties with them, and acceſſary to that Increaſe.</p>
            <p>IN this Caſe, we are not joining againſt an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my who is fomenting Diſcords on our Continent, and uſing all poſſible Means to make Slaves of us and our Children; but againſt a People who have not injured us.</p>
            <p>IF thoſe who were ſpoiled and wronged, ſhould at length make Slaves of their Oppreſſors, and continue Slavery to their Poſterity, it would look rigorous to candid Men: But to act that Part toward a People, when neither they nor their Fathers have injured us, hath ſomething in it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, and requires our ſerious Attention.</p>
            <p>OUR Children breaking a Bone; getting ſo bruiſed, that a Leg or an Arm muſt be taken off; loſt for a few Hours, ſo that we deſpair of their being found again; a Friend hurt, ſo that he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in a Day or two; theſe move us with Grief: And did we attend to theſe Scenes in <hi>Africa,</hi> in like Manner as if they were tranſacted in our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and ſympathiſe with the <hi>Negroes,</hi> in all their Afflictions and Miſeries, as we do with our Children or Friends; we ſhould be more careful
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:009314_0043_1030DF62603554B0"/>
to do nothing in any Degree helping forward a Trade productive of ſo many, and ſo great Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. Great Diſtance makes nothing in our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour.—To willingly join with Unrighteouſneſs, to the Injury of Men who live ſome Thouſand Miles off, is the ſame in Subſtance, as joining with it to the Injury of our Neighbours.</p>
            <p>IN the Eye of pure Juſtice. Actions are regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the Spirit and Diſpoſition they ariſe from: Some Evils are accounted ſcandalous, and the Deſire of Reputation may keep ſelfiſh Men from appearing openly in them; but he who is ſhy on that Account, and yet by indirect Means promotes that Evil, and ſhares in the Profit of it, cannot be innocent.</p>
            <p>HE who, with View to Self-intereſt, buys a Slave, made ſo by Violence, and only on the Strength of ſuch Purchaſe holds him a Slave, thereby joins Hands with thoſe who committed that Violence, and in the Nature of Things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes chargeable with the Guilt.</p>
            <p>SUPPOSE a Man wants a Slave, and being in <hi>Guiney,</hi> goes and hides by the Path where Boys paſs from one little Town to another, and there catches one the Day he expects to ſail; and taking him on board, brings him home, without any aggravating Circumſtances. Suppoſe another buys a Man, taken by them who live by Plunder and the Slave-Trade: They often ſteal them private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and often ſhed much Blood in getting them. He who buys the Slave thus taken, pays thoſe Men ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their Wickedneſs, and makes himſelf Party with them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:009314_0044_1030DF63F1396120"/>
WHATEVER Nicety of Diſtinction there may be, betwixt going in Perſon on Expeditions to catch Slaves, and buying thoſe, with a View to Self-intereſt, which others have taken; it is clear and plain to an upright Mind, that ſuch Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in Words, not in Subſtance; for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are concerned in the ſame Work, and have a neceſſary Connection with, and Dependance on, each other; for were there none to purchaſe Slaves, they who live by ſtealing and ſelling them, would of Conſequence do leſs at it.</p>
            <p>SOME would buy a <hi>Negroe</hi> brought from <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,</hi> with a View to Self-intereſt, and keep him a Slave, who yet would ſeem to ſcruple to take Arms, and join with Men employed in taking Slaves.</p>
            <p>OTHERS have civil <hi>Negroes,</hi> who were born in our Country, capable and likely to manage well for themſelves; whom they keep as Slaves, without ever trying them with Freedom, and take the Profit of their Labour as a Part of their Eſtates, and yet diſapprove bringing them from their own Country.</p>
            <p>IF thoſe <hi>Negroes</hi> had come here, as Merchants, with their Ivory and Gold Duſt, in order to trade with us, and ſome powerful Perſon had took their Effects to himſelf, and then put them to hard Labour, and ever after conſidered them as Slaves, the Action would be looked upon as unrighteous.</p>
            <p>THOSE <hi>Negroe</hi> Merchants having Children after their being among us, whoſe Endowments and Conduct were like other Peoples in common, who attaining to mature Age, and requeſting to
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:009314_0045_1030DF6AF07E98B8"/>
have their Liberty, ſhould be told they were born in Slavery, and were lawful Slaves, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Requeſt denied; the Conduct of ſuch Perſons toward them, would be looked upon as unfair and oppreſſive.</p>
            <p>IN the preſent Caſe, relating to Home-born <hi>Negroes,</hi> whoſe Underſtandings and Behaviour are as good as common among other People, if we have any Claim to them as Slaves, that Claim is grounded on their being the Children or Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of Slaves, who, in general, were made ſuch through Means as unrighteous, and attended with more terrible Circumſtances than the Caſe here ſuppoſed; ſo that when we trace our Claim to the Bott<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, theſe Home-born <hi>Negroes</hi> having paid for their Education, and given reaſonable Security to thoſe who owned them, in caſe of their becoming chargeable, we have no more equitable Right to their Service, than we ſhould if they were the Children of honeſt Merchants who came from <hi>Guiney</hi> in an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſel to trade with us.</p>
            <p>IF we claim any Right to them as the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Slaves, we build on the Foundation laid by them, who made Slaves of their Anceſtors; ſo that of Neceſſity we muſt either juſtify the Trade, or relinquiſh our Right to them, as being the Children of Slaves.</p>
            <p>WHY ſhould it ſeem right to honeſt Men to make Advantage by theſe People more than by others? Others enjoy Freedom, receive Wages, equal to their Work, at, or near, ſuch Time as they have diſcharged theſe equitable Obligations
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:009314_0046_1030DF6C89205590"/>
they are under to thoſe who educated them.—Theſe have made no Contract to ſerve; been no more expenſive in raiſing up than others, and many of them appear as likely to make a right Uſe of Freedom as other People; which Way then can an honeſt Man withhold from them that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which is the free Gift of the Moſt High to his rational Creatures?</p>
            <p>THE Upright in Heart cannot ſucceed the Wicked in their Wickedneſs; nor is it conſonant to the Life they live, to hold faſt an Advantage unjuſtly gained.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Negroes</hi> who live by Plunder, and the Slave-Trade, ſteal poor innocent Children, invade their Neighbours Territories, and ſpill much Blood to get theſe Slaves: And can it be poſſible for an honeſt Man to think that, with View to Self-intereſt, we may continue Slavery to the Offspring of theſe unhappy Sufferers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> merely becauſe they are the Children of Slaves, and not have a Share of this Guilt.</p>
            <p>IT is granted by many, that the Means uſed in getting them are unrighteous, and that buying them, when brought here, is wrong; yet as ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them free is attended with ſome Difficulty, they do not comply with it; but ſeem to be of the Opinion, that to give them Food and Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and keep them Servants, without any other Wages, is the beſt Way to manage them that they know of: And hoping that their Children after them will not be cruel to the <hi>Negroes,</hi> conclude to leave them as Slaves to their Children.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:009314_0047_1030DF733AE122A8"/>
WHILE preſent outward Intereſt is the chief Object of our Attention, we ſhall feel many Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections in our Minds againſt renouncing our Claim to them, as the Children of Slaves; for being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed with wrong Opinions, prevents our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eeing Things clearly, which, to indifferent Perſons, are eaſy to be ſeen.</p>
            <p>SUPPOSE a Perſon Seventy Years paſt, in low Circumſtances, bought a <hi>Negroe</hi> Man and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and that the Children of ſuch Perſon are now wealthy, and have the Children of ſuch Slaves. Admit that the firſt <hi>Negroe</hi> Man and his Wife did as much Buſineſs as their Maſter and Miſtreſs, and that the Children of the Slaves have done ſome more than their young Maſters: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, on the whole, that the Expence of Living has been leſs on the <hi>Negroes</hi> Side, than on the other (all which are no improbable Suppoſitions) it follows, that in Equity theſe <hi>Negroes</hi> have a Right to a Part of this Increaſe; that ſhould ſome Difficulties ariſe on their being ſet free, there is Reaſon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> us patiently to labour through them.</p>
            <p>As the Conduct of Men varies, relating to Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Society; ſo different Treatment is juſtly due to them. Indiſcreet Men occaſion Trouble in the World; and it remains to be the Care of ſuch, who ſeek the Good of Mankind, to admoniſh as they find Occaſion.</p>
            <p>THE Slothfulneſs of ſome of them, in providing for themſelves and Families, it is likely, would require the Notice of their Neighbours; nor is it unlikely that ſome would, with Juſtice, be made Servants, and others puniſhed for their Crimes.
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:009314_0048_1030DF74D4C2D1C0"/>
Pure Juſtice points out to each Individual their Due; but to deny a People the Privilege of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Creatures, on a Suppoſition that, being free, many of them would be troubleſome to us, is to mix the Condition of good and bad Men together, and treat the whole as the worſt of them deſerve.</p>
            <p>IF we ſeriouſly conſider, that Liberty is the Right of innocent Men; that the Mighty GOD is a Refuge for the Oppreſſed; that in Reality we are indebted to them; that they being ſet free, are ſtill liable to the Penalties of our Laws, and as likely to have Puniſhment for their Crimes as other People: This may anſwer all our Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And to retain them in perpetual Servitude, without juſt Cauſe for it, will produce Effects, in the Event, more grievous than ſetting them free would do, when a real Love to Truth and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was the Motive to it.</p>
            <p>OUR Authority over them ſtands originally in a Purchaſe made from thoſe who, as to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, obtained theirs by Unrighteouſneſs. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we have Recourſe to ſuch Authority, it tends more or leſs to obſtruct the Channels, through which the perfect Plant in us receives Nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>THERE is a Principle, which is pure, placed in the human Mind, which in different Places and Ages hath had different Names; it is, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, pure, and proceeds from GOD.—It is deep, and inward, confined to no Forms of Religion, nor excluded from any, where the Heart ſtands in perfect Sincerity. In whomſoever this takes Root, and grows, of what Nation ſoever, they
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:009314_0049_1030DF767256C3B8"/>
become Brethren, in the beſt Senſe of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Uſing ourſelves to take Ways which appear moſt eaſy to us, when inconſiſtent with that Purity which is without Beginning, we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſet up a Government of our own, and deny Obedience to him, whoſe Service is true Liberty.</p>
            <p>HE that has a Servant, made ſo wrongfully, and knows it to be ſo, when he treats him other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than a free Man, when he reaps the Benefit of his Labour, without paying him ſuch Wages as are reaſonably due to free Men for the like Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, Cloaths excepted; theſe Things, tho' done in Calmneſs, without any Shew of Diſorder, do yet deprave the Mind in like Manner, and with as great Certainty, as prevailing Cold congeals Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Theſe Steps taken by Maſters, and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſtriking the Minds of their Children, whilſt young, leave leſs Room for that which is good to work upon them. The Cuſtoms of their Parents, their Neighbours, and the People with whom they converſe, working upon their Minds; and they, from thence, conceiving Ideas of Things, and Modes of Conduct, the Entrance into their Hearts becomes, in a great Meaſure, ſhut up againſt the gentle Movings of uncreated Purity.</p>
            <p>FROM one Age to another, the Gloom grows thicker and darker, till Error gets eſtabliſhed by general Opinion; that whoever attends to perfect Goodneſs, and remains under the melting Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it, finds a Path unknown to many, and ſees the Neceſſity to lean upon the Arm of Divine Strength, and dwell alone, or with a few, in the right committing their Cauſe to him, who
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:009314_0050_1030DF78088D1640"/>
is a Refuge for his People, in all their Troubles.</p>
            <p>WHERE, through the Agreement of a Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, ſome Channels of Juſtice are ſtopped, and Men may ſupport their Characters as juſt Men, by being juſt to a Party, there is great Danger of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting an Alliance with that Spirit, which ſtands in Oppoſition to the GOD of Love, and ſpreads Diſcord, Trouble and Vexation among ſuch who give up to the Influence of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Negroes</hi> are our Fellow Creatures, and their preſent Condition amongſt us requires our ſerious Conſideration. We know not the Time when thoſe Scales, in which Mountains are weighed, may turn. The Parent of Mankind is gracious: His Care is over his ſmalleſt Creatures; and a Multitude of Men eſcape not his Notice: And though many of them are trodden down, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, yet he remembers them: He ſeeth their Affliction, and looketh upon the ſpreading increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Exaltation of the Oppreſſor. He turns the Channels of Power, humbles the moſt haughty People, and gives Deliverance to the Oppreſſed, at ſuch Periods as are conſiſtent with his infinite Juſtice and Goodneſs. And wherever Gain is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to Equity, and wrong Things publickly encouraged to that Degree, that Wickedneſs takes Root, and ſpreads wide amongſt the Inhabitants of a Country, there is real Cauſe for Sorrow to all ſuch, whoſe Love to Mankind ſtands on a true Principle, and wiſely conſider the End and Event of Things.</p>
