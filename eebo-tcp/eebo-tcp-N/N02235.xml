            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SOLOMON the Wiſe (as the Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed well obſerve) in the former part of our Context, is inſtructing Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects with their Duty toward Rulers, Which Duty he urges upon them with many excellent Motives and Arguments to enforce their Loyalty &amp; Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; and left Rulers from what he had ſaid concerning the Obedience of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſhou'd take occaſion to abuſe their Power, leſt they ſhou'd think themſelves Priviledged ones to do as they liſt, &amp; become Arbitrary &amp; Deſpotick: He therefore brings in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veat, and inſerts an Admonition and puts them in mind that as Subjects may not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel againſt lawful Authority (and indeed

            <p>Let me add two or three Words here.</p>
            <p>(1.) <hi>If you will not Submit to the Laws, the mild and gracious Government of this Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Glorious King, it will be juſt with God, to Puniſh you in Leaving and giving you over into the hands of wicked and ungodly Rulers, and ſuch who ſhall Rule you with a Rod of Iron.</hi> Read &amp; T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Sinners, you have ſome of you Rejected Jeſus Chriſt and his Government, Thouſands of times, &amp; practically ſaid as they, Luk<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 19 14. <hi>We will not have this Man to Rule over us.</hi> What if God ſhould deal with you ſomewhat after the manner he dealt with them of old, in the above-cited, 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 8 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16.

            </p>
            <p>(2.) <hi>Your Submiſſion is of abſolute Neceſſity, in order to your Salvation.</hi> There's no way poſſible for poor ſinners to eſcape the Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Hell, but this of Submiſſion to Chriſt as their King to Rule and Govern them.

            <p>Finally. <hi>Unfaithfulneſs in Relative Duties, is an Evidence of an Unſound Heart and a Graceleſs ſtate; no leſs than Unfaithfulneſs in Perſonal Duties.</hi> Grace diſpoſes men for a diſcharge of both; it inclines men to keep all God's Commands, bows the Heart to the Yoke of Jeſus Chriſt. A mans ſtate may oft times be known by his deportment in Relative Capacities: And he an't a good Magiſtrate, a good Miniſter, good Parent, a good Subject, ſuſtaining ſuch a Cap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
