            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I SAILED from Boſton, on board the India Packet, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt 29th, 1796, with pleaſant weather, winds N. E; ſtear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our courſe S. E. September 18th, on our courſe for Cape Horn the Southern extremity of South America; pleaſant weather, light gales of wind attended with a little rain. October 11th.—Nothing material happened. Now have the N. E. Trades Freſh. October 5th.—Some little diſturbance in the Ship as is Natural to ſuppoſe there being five different languages on board. I beginning to make a little proficiency in Navigation. Sunday October 25th.—In Lt. 6. S. ſtearing our courſe S. E. by S. we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered thoſe remarkable clouds called the Magalen clouds, ſuppoſed to take their name from being diſcovered by Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alen and, are actually about vertical with the Straits of Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alen. The number of theſe clouds are three and perhaps the greateſt curioſity ever eye beheld. One of them is jet black the others white. Perhaps the curious reader will que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry about the truth of this relation. Hundreds are the number of we hardy Seamen, that have been eye witneſs of the ſame. To entertain the reader with a further deſcription of theſe
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033936_0005_0FFA4ABB40BBCE20"/>clouds. They revole round each other in their ſeveral or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits. Their appearance is always plain unleſs obſtructed by a cloudy horrizon, and always in the ſame place except revolving. Sunday October 30th—Morning fair but ſoon found our horrizon obſtucted by clouds, a melancholy ſcene to behold; there came on a gale of wind; finding ourſelves in eminant danger of being foundered. As the gale increaſed we ſoon found our fore topmaſt about our cars, carried cloſe down to the cap. In replacing the fore topmaſt we unfortunately loſt our main top gallantmaſt. The reader will natural ſuppoſe our ſituation really diſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and had it not been for the greateſt exertion we muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable periſhed. Saturday November 5th—All an entire calm nothing material to day. Sunday November 6th— Lt. 45,0. 58 m. S. very boiſterous weather a great variety of birds, ſome ſurpriſing whales ſeen in thoſe latitudes. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember 20th—By obſervation we ſuppoſed ourſelves not far diſtant from Cape Horn. In the Lt. 55 S. frequently ſeeing ſeals of an enormous ſize, and every kind of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, natural to the South Seas. Thurſday December 2d— and then diſcovered Cape Horn bearing N. from us. We had a very tedious time of it in geting up with the Cape; but now have very fine weather for this latitude. We find ourſelves becalmed at this time, but ſoon have a breeze of wind and continue our courſe to the ſouthward.</p>
            <p>Dec. 9th—In Lt. 59,0. 30m. S. we diſcovered an aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing Mountain of ice, that we found to be by our Quad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants four miles in height, and ſuppoſed to be twenty four in circumference. Among the curioſities in the South Sea this is conſidered one of the greateſt. However in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible this may appear kind reader, yet hiſtory will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm it. Catching ſome Albetroſſes twenty feet from one wing to the other. One very remarkable thing in this lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, is that the ſun is to be ſeen nineteen hours out of twenty four, and plain day light continually. Sunday De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember 25th—Nothing particular occured. We have now ſhaped our course for the N. W. Coaſt of America which is N. N. W.</p>
            <p>January 1ſt 1979.—By obſervation find ourſelves in Lt. 25,0. 30m. S. nigh the Trophic Line. We now begin to think of prepairing ourſelves for the N. W. Indians, where we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to procure our furs. Diſtreſſing is our ſituation on account of bad proviſions, by the neglect of the owners of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033936_0006_0FFA15EDFB776768"/>the Ship, confined to three ſmall biſcuits per day, and three pints of water.—In this ſituation for three months, with a ſmall allowance of beef.</p>
            <p>Indulgent reader do not let me tire your patience, with unneceſſary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> for the want of good ſtile being bread without it, and but little chance for improvement. Sat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urday Jan. 14th.—We have now croſſed the Equator and find ourſelves in Lt. 6 N. In taking a great many ſea Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle are tolerably well furniſhed for proviſion. We ſuffered a great deal for the want of water; but this day have had a very fine ſhower of rain, which furniſhed us with a good ſupply. The ſharks are ſurpriſingly plenty in this latitude; ſome of them are ſo ravenous that while our beef is toing along ſide, which neceſſity requires they take it away net and all.</p>
            <p>I have ſome occaſion to complain of our Captain on the account of uſage, his committing aſſault and battery on a number of the crew, is ſomething I dont ſo well reliſh, but am not in a ſituation to ſeek my redreſs at preſent, but anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iouſly wait the arrival of the time, in which I will acquiant him that I took umbridge at it, and ſhall with the greateſt propriety ſeek my redreſs.</p>
            <p>Sunday January 21ſt.—Stearing N. W. by N. by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation found ourſelves in Lt. 15 N. nothing meterial oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred. Saturday February 18th.—We are now in Lt. 49° 33 N. Being diſtreſſed with a terrible gale of wind, of courſe excited ſome alarm in us, for the ſeas run mountains high, and to appearance ſhould have our ſhip covered, daſhing and beating as if ſhe would go to pieces every moment. Feel for us reader in this ſituation, what muſt the feelings within our breaſt be, expecting to go to the bottom every minute; but through divine aſſiſtance and a little of our own exertions we ſoon cleared ourſelves of fear; got our ſails all in, and our yards and maſt down on deck. In this ſituation we remained about forty eight hours, and then the ſtorm abated ſo that in a ſhort time we found ourſelves in our uſual ſituation. Kind reader, I acknowledge we had great reaſon to thank Neptune the governor of the Seas.</p>
            <p>Tueſday February 21ſt 1797.—We this morning had the good fortune to diſcover land, at 18 Leagues diſtance, and after three days ſail up into Norfolk Sound and come to anchor, after being at Sea about ſix months. Norfolk Sound is in Lat. 58° 5 N. Long. not aſcertained, but thought to be in about 129 E.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:033936_0007_0FFA4ACE2329F018"/>
We ſoon was incompaſſed about with canoes with 20, ſome 30 Indians in each. Not lying but about a mile from the ſhore we had traffic enough.</p>
            <p>After wooding, and watering, and repairing, we weighed our anchor and ſailed for Mearſes Bay, about 3° to the Southward; had very good ſucceſs in trade, found furs plenty being the firſt ſhip on the Coaſt this ſeaſon, purchaſed our furs advantageouſly, after lying at anchor about 20 days; ſet ſail for Charlotte's Iſland, about 1° to the Southward; after arriving there was viſited by a great number of canoes; but could not trade much on account of the boiſterous weath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; at our arrival at this place, we let go our anchor; but on account of the gales that are prevalent here, was obliged to heave it up, and make ſail ſeven times in the ſpace of 24 hours. We then thought beſt to ſail for Skiticus ſtill furth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the Southward; the diſtance about 40 miles.</p>
            <p>After arriving we came to anchor, and find here a large Village rather a Metropolis of this Nation, where we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed three hundred ſkins.</p>
            <p>Thurſday March 16th.—We have had the good fortune to procure eleven hundered ſkins beſt prime. After ſett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſail from this, we ſhape our courſe for Norfolk Sound, on arriving in Norfolk Sound, we ſpoke the ſhip Diſpatch, Capt. Bowers, from Boſton, under way out of the Sound, all hands, in good ſpirits, excepting one ſick with the ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey, a diſorder which I ſuffered much from. You may well conceive with what raptures we imbraced one another, they being the firſt chriſtian people we have ſeen ſince we left Boſton; the Diſpatch being bound to Mearſes Bay, we tacked ſhip, and went in company with them. On our arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val at the Bay, we found lying there, Capt. Trotter, in a brig from Providence, likewiſe the brig Hazzard from Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, ſloop Capt. Lay, maſter. We had no particular news from them, all were well. We here had good ſucceſs in purchaſing furs. Weighed anchor and ſet ſail for Norfolk Sound, arriving there, we got a ſupply of wood and water, we then purchaſed a few furs.</p>
            <p>The reader will not conſider me to minute in mentioning ſo often our purchaſing furs, as they were the only object of our Voyage, the number of ſkins purchaſed was 2200 and upwards.</p>
            <p>The Natives of the N. W. part of this Country, are very much alike in their manners, they ſpeak a number of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033936_0008_0FFA47C8A3DBEA98"/>they are a hardy robuſt ſet of people, about a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſize, reſembling our Indian very much, of a tawny complexion.</p>
            <p>A ſhort deſcription of the animals may attract the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the reader.
<list>
                  <item>1ſt. The ſea animal, the Elephant about the ſize of a large ox, when full grown, utter a terrible roaring that at times will excite alarm in any human crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; principally of a vermilion color.</item>

            <p>The fowl kind are extremely numerous ſuch as Geeſe, Turkeys, Brants, Ducks, of every kind, the Eagle and Pel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican, the largeſt of the feathered race, in theſe Northern and unexplored regions.</p>
            <p>The ſea Otter that valuable animal, eminant for its fine fur. In Cook's performances, theſe ſkins were ſold in China for 100 Dollars per ſkin, but we ſold them for 25 or 30.</p>
            <p>May 31ſt 1797.—We ſet ſail for China ſtearing S. S. W. with a fine breeze.</p>
            <p>INDIA PACKET, June 30th, 1797.—We continue on our paſſage for China, with a briſk wind, ſtearing S. W. in Lat. 30 N. two of our men are taken with the ſcurvey, a diſorder very common in ſuch a voyage.</p>
            <p>I. P. July 7th.—In Lat. 21 N. we loſt our main and fore top maſt, in a very heavy Squall of wind, we however, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed them very ſoon.</p>
            <p>I. P. July 24th.—In Lat. 14 N. L. 144° 30, ſeven of our crew have the ſcurvy, very bad, including our chief officer. We have been becalmed about 18 days; but have now a breeze of wind.</p>
            <p>I. P. July 30th.—We had the fortune to diſcover the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland Tinnian, at 5 A. M. and got in with it at two P. M. We came to anchor and ſent our boat on ſhore, with the ſick to the number of ſeven; left them and brought of a fine Bullock, and five hundred oranges, a number of cocoanuts, and ſeveral hogs.

            <p>Wambo harbour, September 1ſt 1797.—The trade of Wambo. As to the trade of this Country, it is rendered ſomething difficult on account of their precarious diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being ever open and ready to accept of every advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage as robbing, pilfering, &amp;c. &amp;c. Their mode of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping is ſomething very peculiar; they burn incenſe night and morning; continually offering up ſacrifices to the Deity, or to uſe their Language to Joſe. There are immenſe numbers that are born and live on the waters until they die: It is ſuppoſed that there are one Million that live on the waters continually. It is too well known in this Country to enter into a long hiſtory of the Chineſe or their manners in general.</p>
            <p>I do not wiſh to tire the reader with intrinſic circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; but after diſpoſing of our furs for money, purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ourſelves a Cargo of Teas and a few China curioſities, we ſet ſail for Boſton, the 12th of November 1797.— Some apologies are neceſſary in this caſe, but when the reader is become acquainted with the circumſtances he will be kind enough to excuſe me for not continuing my jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal in a regular manner as I intended. In the commenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Voyage; I had the misfortune of being ſick the moſt part of the time after I left China unable to write. So I ſhall endeavour to ſatisfy the reader, as far as poſſible.</p>
            <p>October 17th.—Loſt ſight of land on our paſſage for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica after ſailing through the China Seas and down the coaſt of Africa, through the ſtraits of Balaboam by Java-head for ninety days we arrived at the Cape of Goodhope the Southern extremity of Africa. In Lat. 34° 30 S. Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton lying in 23 N. the reader may eaſily eſtimate the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. The Cape of Goodhope is the garden of Africa. It being very pleaſantly ſituated and the moſt ſpacious Bay in the world lying before the town. This town was taken by the Dutch, a long time ſince from the Hottentots, but was three years ſince captured by the Engliſh; and now is in the hands of them and guarded by as large a ſleet for the place as any in the known world. We found cauſe to lie
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033936_0010_0FFA47F8D2BC7688"/>in this place ten days on account of our ſick: We had the misfortune to loſe three of our people, on our paſſage from China; one of them third mate. We find here a variety of people: Engliſh, Dutch, Hottentots, too numerous to mention. One curioſity is the Hottentots ſheep, of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ormous ſize; their tails are ſaid to weigh 25lb. I have ſeen them to weigh 15lb. The fowl kind, the Oſtrich are found here in plenty, the Caſovarous are ſeen here, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary fowl. The Caſovarous are about the ſize of the Oſtrich, not unlike them except their wings and bruſtles.</p>
            <p>February 3d.—This morning ſet ſail for Boſton, leaving one of our men ſick at the Cape, and after coming too, at the Iſland Aſanchiant to get a little refreſhment by fiſh and turkle. We ſet ſail for Boſton. A deſcription may not be diſagreeable to the indulgent reader. It is in Lat. 8 S. a continued clift of rocks, about 24 miles in circumference. Deſtitute of inhabitants or any animal except rats, and them without number of an enormous ſize. Of fowl kind is found here the man of war bird, and Gull in plenty. The turkle of this place are very large ſome weighing 900lb. It being within about 8° of the Equinoctial line, S. is well adapted to them. The turtle furniſhed us with the moſt delicious diſh being a variety of meats in them. For brev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity ſake, I muſt leave this ſubject and continue a ſketch of the paſſage from China to America.</p>
