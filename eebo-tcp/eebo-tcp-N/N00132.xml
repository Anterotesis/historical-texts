            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Sometimes the Lord doth defend meerly and only by his own hand; and that is either by taking away the desire of the Enemy, that the Enemy shall not desire to do his People any harm as the Lord Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to his People of old, when they went up to appear before the Lord thrice in the year, <hi>at that time no man shall desire their Land,</hi> Exod <hi>34.24</hi> they should at that time be so safe from invasion; or if the Enemy shall desire and attempt to do his People harm: yet sometimes the Lord by his immediate hand stirreth up the spirit of some <hi>Cyrus</hi> to be their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectour, as the People, of whom the Text doth speak, did finde it upo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Only let us distinguish of the degree of Protection:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> Sometimes the Protection is total and full without any loss at all to Gods People, that whatever the Blasphemous threatnings of a <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shekah</hi> hath been in the day of Reproach and time of <hi>Zions</hi> trouble, yet the Lord putteth a Hook into the Nose, and a Bridle into the Lips of the Enemy, and would not suffer them so much as to come into the City, nor shoot an Arrow, nor come before them with a Shield, <hi>Isai. 37.38.</hi> then the Protection is total and plenary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Sometimes the Lord only defends the Body of his People, the most considerable part of them, and then the loss they suffer shall be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at a very considerable price; when <hi>Joshua</hi> had lost about thirty six men, and had sought out and removed the accursed thing, it then must cost the Enemy no less then <hi>twelve thousand</hi> lives, <hi>Josh.</hi> 7.8—25. the Lord will make it manifest that <hi>precious in his sight is the death of his Saints, Psal. 116.15.</hi> if a Godly man did foresee at what price the Lord of Hosts doth value his life, and how many lives it must cost the Enemy, if he doth suffer the loss of his own life in the cause of God, &amp; for his People, it would make him surely content <hi>Sampson</hi> like, to lay down his life even among the <hi>Philistims</hi>: thus you have heard how the Lords protecting presence is as <hi>a Wall of fire round about the Lords People,</hi> the conclusion of this, <hi>who is like to thee O Israel? a People saved of the Lord, the shield of thine help, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
