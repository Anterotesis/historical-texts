            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Reader.</head>
            <p>THERE are Pretenders unto <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> whoſe <hi>Religion</hi> does chiefly conſiſt in being of this or the other particular <hi>Party</hi> of men making a Profeſſion of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> If that is all their Godlineſs, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them to fall in with thoſe that have moſt of Truth in their more pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar <hi>Perſwaſions,</hi> they have only the <hi>Form</hi> without the <hi>Power.</hi> In our Nation, which has the Name of <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and <hi>Reformed,</hi> ſome are of the <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> others for the <hi>Presbyterian,</hi> others for the <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational,</hi> others for the <hi>Antipaedobaptiſts</hi> Form. Theſe differ not in the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Articles of Faith; and from thence it is, that there are amongſt them,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000963_0003_0FADE4628D367628"/>
all, ſome, with whom <hi>Godlineſs</hi> in the Truth and Power is to be found: and yet ſome under all theſe Denominations, who have only the <hi>Form.</hi> That the Churches in <hi>New-England</hi> which in their Primitive Conſtitution conſiſted of <hi>the Good Old Puritan Nonconformiſts,</hi> were fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for Religion in the Purity and Power of it, cannot be denied. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, in our firſt and beſt Times, there were Tares and Chaff mixed with the Wheat. That there is now a great De<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cay amongſt Profeſſors of Religion in this Land (would to God it were not ſo amongſt Profeſſors of our way in the other <hi>England</hi> alſo) muſt likewiſe be confeſſed. There is in that <hi>Practical and Judicial Diſcourſe</hi>

               </gap>mitted herewith, a faithful Teſtimony againſt thoſe <hi>Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,</hi> which do witneſs to our Faces that this Generation comes ſhort of what their Predeceſſors ſometimes were. The Reverend Author obſerveth, That, <hi>As to many of the Riſing Generation, there is a fondneſs after New Things, and that they are become Diſputants for thoſe Things, which their Fathers left a Pleaſant Land for the Avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of. And that many stand off from
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000963_0004_0FADE46294C012A0"/>
Communion, becauſe they would not be under Diſcipline: That there are ſome Intemperate Church Members, who ſpend their precious Time in frequenting Publick Houſes, and keeping looſe Company: That Profeſſors are ready to comply with the vain Cuſtoms of the Times.</hi> Theſe and many the like Paſſages the Reader will find in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Sermons.</hi> It is therefore ſadly evident, that Religion in the Power of it is decaying and dying. Alas! There are now crept into ſome of our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es ſuch Things, as the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> in the firſt Reformed Churches in <hi>France</hi> has condemned as Cenſurable Evils: and which the National <hi>Synod</hi> held at <hi>Dort</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> declares to be <hi>Levity unbecoming Christians, an Offence to the Godly, and tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>If theſe things be ſo, is not that which was once a <hi>Noble Vine and wholly a Right Seed,</hi> degenerating apace? There are ſome Churches in the World, that never had that Purity of Diſcipline amongſt them, which the Churches in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> have been advantaged with, who notwithſtanding, of late years, are bleſſed

with a <hi>Young Generation</hi> abounding in theſe Duties, of Faith and Obedience, in which <hi>Godlineſs in the Power of it,</hi> does very much conſiſt. I remember, that ten years ago, that Excellent Perſon Dr. <hi>Walker,</hi> then Miniſter at <hi>Alderman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> aſſured me that in that Pariſh, there were a conſiderable Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Young perſons, who often met together to Pray and Conferr about the things wherein their Souls were concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that every month, in order to their more prepared Coming to the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> they ſpent a Day in Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er together. When the Doctor told me this, I was ſurpriſed with aſtoniſhing joy, at the Hearing of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But it is much more ſurpriſing, that there is Printed the laſt year at <hi>London, An Account of the Riſe and Progreſs of the Religious Societies in that City, and of the Endeavours of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Manners,</hi> Publiſhed by Mr. <hi>Joſiah Woodward,</hi> a worthy Conformiſt Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who ſays, that it is the practice of thoſe Societies to partake of the Holy Supper of the Lord frequently, thereby to devote themſelves afreſh to their Good Maſter, and as a means of receiving Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000963_0006_0FADE4688215FF20"/>
Strength from Him; and that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them have, by the Grace of God, attained to that Excellent Primitive Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of frequent Communicating <hi>without growing formal.</hi> Moreover, he has theſe words, which I could not but ſet a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Remark upon. <hi>It is</hi> (ſaith my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor in p 61.) <hi>required of ſuch as joyn themſelves to them, that they give the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty a ſolemn account of their ſenſe of ſpiritual things with the real Motives, which lead them to this Undertaking, and what they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly purpoſe as to their future Life. This is many times done in Writing; and I have peruſed ſome of their Papers, and have found them penned in ſuch an honeſt affectionate and undiſguiſed ſtyle, with ſuch pious and ſenſible Expreſſions, and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>WE need not to look far back for the <hi>Analyſis</hi> of our <hi>Text. Paul,</hi> in the beginning of this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, gives warning to <hi>Timothy</hi> of a great <hi>Apostaſy</hi> that ſhould come in the latter days, in which there ſhould be a general defection of Profeſſors.

Days,</hi> is in the Goſpel intended, or in them is comprized, the whole time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Christ's Aſcenſion.</hi> and the Great Day of <hi>Judgment.</hi> However, there are ſome earlier, and ſome later <hi>periods</hi> point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to in this <hi>Aera.</hi> This <hi>Prediction</hi> may comprize generally the whole time: and this ſignifying, <hi>That the times of clear Goſpel light, ſhall not be free from men of perverſe minds, notwithſtanding their making a profeſſion of Chriſt.</hi> There may alſo be aimed in theſe words, the giving us a Deſcription of the <hi>Apoſtaſy</hi> of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> of which there are warnings not a few offered in the <hi>New-Teſtament</hi>; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Spirit of <hi>Antichriſtianiſm</hi> is here abundantly deciphered. But it is appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to all times of defection among Profeſſors of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi>; and may have reſpect to the laſt and worſt times, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding the great <hi>Reformation</hi> which is expected, of which our Saviour, Luk. 18 8. <hi>When the Son of Man cometh, ſhall he find Faith on the Earth?</hi> The word <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> ſignifyeth, <hi>hard, difficult, moleſtful</hi>; and ſuch times do expoſe men to danger, and are therefore <hi>Perilous.</hi> It intends, that it will be hard for a man to live
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000963_0014_0FADE4715C923D50"/>
like a true Chriſtian, becauſe he will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf thereby. Now the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth not only give warning in general of ſuch times, but he proceeds to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterize them, by the <hi>genius</hi> and carriage of men in them: for, <hi>they are the evil hearts and carriages of men that make the times evil.</hi> There are a great many notes which the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> here layeth down, which I ſhall not particularly enquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: but the words of our <hi>Text</hi> contain in them one of theſe, and the laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, but not the leaſt: to all of which he ſubjoyns in the latter end of this <hi>verſe</hi> a direction to Chriſtians how to carry it to ſuch men, <hi>viz. to withdraw from their Communion.</hi> All the former that are mentioned, were open and ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicious Crimes that men fall into; but this directs us to a more covered wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hiding it ſelf under a pretence of Piety: of which ſort of men there is the greateſt peril of all.</p>
            <p>In the words then we have the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of a <hi>Church Hypocrite,</hi> or of one that pretends to be <hi>Religious,</hi> but is indeed <hi>impious.</hi> If we take all theſe particular notes to go into the making

                     <hi>A.</hi> The word <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> here uſed, ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth <hi>Right Worſhip,</hi> and is in the ſtrict ſenſe, reſtrained to the Duties of the <hi>Firſt Table,</hi> which refer to the Worſhip of God, both <hi>Natural,</hi> and <hi>Inſtituted</hi>; both the <hi>manner,</hi> and ſpecial <hi>times</hi> of it. But it is frequently uſed <hi>Synechdochrically,</hi> for all <hi>Religion,</hi> and comprizeth under it all the Duties required in the Goſpel, both <hi>towards God,</hi> and <hi>towards man,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as done in Obedience to the Command or revealed Will of God: and we may here take it in the moſt comprehenſive ſenſe. And we before obſerved, that the word <hi>Form</hi> intends not that which is <hi>Eſſential,</hi> but <hi>Accidental</hi>; and indeed, where there is the Eſſential Form, it includes the power in it: for, the eſſential form of it, is the Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit, whereby <hi>the Law of God is written in our hearts,</hi> and this will appear in our lives, for the operations of things are according to their eſſential forms But there are two other ſenſes of the word, as it is uſed in the <hi>Greek Language,</hi> which may both come under our preſent conſideration, as being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable from the <hi>Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="20" facs="unknown:000963_0019_0FADE474C5939108"/>1. The word is ſometimes uſed for the Rule which a man profeſſeth himſelf to be under the obligation of, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to follow in his actions. Hence we read of a <hi>form of knowledge,</hi> Rom. 2.20. and that is as much as a ſound <hi>Creed.</hi> We read of the Doctrines according to Godlineſs. Now there a <hi>form,</hi> or a ſcheam <hi>of ſound words,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.13. and when men do underſtand the <hi>Syſtem</hi> of the Chriſtian Religion, and openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that they do believe thoſe <hi>Articles,</hi> and reſolve to ſtand up in the defence of them, theſe may be ſaid to <hi>have a form of Godlineſs, i. e.</hi> they have it in their heads, and in their mouths, and poſſibly they make no little noiſe in ſtanding up in defence of them, againſt ſuch as do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly ſet themſelves to withſtand and undermine them. Now this form of Godlineſs is not in it ſelf contrary to the power, but a thing neceſſary for all thoſe who deſire rightly to exert it in their Converſation. <hi>Godlineſs</hi> is a <hi>Reaſonable Service</hi> which we owe to God, as we are Creatures endowed with the faculties of underſtanding and will, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. How can we lead godly lives, unleſs we
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000963_0020_0FADE4755D93DE70"/>
are acquainted with the <hi>Rule</hi> pointing of us thereunto: and the Goſpel teacheth us that Rule, for this is that <hi>Grace of God,</hi> of which we are told, that it <hi>teacheth us to deny ungodlineſs,</hi> &amp;c. Tit. 2.11, 12. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this may be where the other is not: men may know, and yet not do; they may make an Orthodox profeſſion, and yet lead an irregular Converſation; we are told of ſuch, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. <hi>ult. They profeſs that they know God, but in works they deny him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Sometimes the word is uſed for an <hi>outward ſhew</hi> or <hi>pretence</hi>; for a <hi>mask,</hi> or a <hi>vizard,</hi> or an <hi>outward appearance.</hi> When a man pretends to be what he is not, and endeavours by his carriages before others, to make a ſpecious ſhew as if he we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="22" facs="unknown:000963_0021_0FADE47630857E58"/>2. What it is to deny the Power of Godlineſs?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>A.</hi> To make this clear, let us obſerve;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the power of Godlineſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends two things in it. The word <hi>power,</hi> uſed in our <hi>Text,</hi> ſignifieth the <hi>vertue, efficacy,</hi> and <hi>force</hi> of a thing: and alſo the <hi>faculty</hi> or <hi>principle</hi> from which it proceeds. Hence, in the power of Godlineſs there is contained.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The inward principle of Sanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Grace; which is the root of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in a Chriſtian. The power of a thing conſiſts in the <hi>internal vertue</hi> that it hath in it: Now Grace is the very life of Godlineſs; nor is any a Godly man, who hath not this Grace in him. God always regards the heart, and he knows it, and he will acknowledge no man to be Godly, but him whoſe <hi>heart is right.</hi> That therefore was it which ſpoiled all their fair pretences, Pſal. 78.37. <hi>their heart was not right with him.</hi> An Unregenerate man cannot be a Godly man, becauſe he hath no principle of Godlineſs in him. He that is Godly, loves God, fears God, delights in his Law, hates ſin, mourns for it, and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000963_0022_0FADE476D2A80BF8"/>
ſeeks a deliverance from it. This is the very diſpoſition of that Grace which he receives from God, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Efficacy of this principle is in the exerciſe of a Godly life. This is <hi>Metonymically</hi> called <hi>Power,</hi> becauſe it is an effect flowing from it, and ſo is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of it: for by the actions the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits are to be diſcerned, and judged of. Hence, according to the life of a Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor, accordingly is this power evidenced. And hence we read of weak Grace, and ſtrong Grace. When a Chriſtian liveth ſo in the work of his Generation; as to Glorify God, in a zealous reſolute purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Holineſs, and withſtanding of Sin, in oppoſition to all that would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand or hinder him, or diſcourage his purſuit of it, he ſhews this <hi>Power</hi>; and this power is oppoſed to weakneſs or infirmity. <hi>Peter</hi> had faith, but he did not diſcover power in it, when he began to ſink, Mat. 14.32. <hi>O thou of little faith, why didſt thou doubt? Abraham</hi> had not only faith, but a powerful faith, <hi>when he believed in hope against hope,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.19, 20, 21. and both theſe reſpects may
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:000963_0023_0FADE4779413F038"/>
come under the conſideration of the matter before us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A thing may be ſaid to be denied in two reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Verbally and profeſſedly: and that is the fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt ſignification of the word; but it cannot be univerſally ſo underſtood here: for, for a man to profeſs the true Religion, and at the ſame time profeſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deny it, is a contradiction. Though it muſt be granted, that a man may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs a thing in the groſs, and yet deny it in ſome of the main parts of it, as will appear in the ſequel. But this is not all, nor yet the thing which is princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally here deſigned.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Practically; and ſo the word is very often uſed <hi>Met<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>phorically,</hi> when men live contrary to their Profeſſion, they a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e ſaid to deny it: and there cannot be a more effectual denial than this is; and hence theſe two are ſet in direct oppoſition, in the forecited, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. <hi>ult.</hi> Now the thing here ſaid to be denied is the <hi>Power of Godlineſs</hi>; and there are two things in which this conſiſts, anſwering to the two fore-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000963_0024_0FADE52414B73CE8"/>
reſpects, in which we were told, the power of Godlineſs conſiſts.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When men pretend to be Godly, &amp; yet by their lives, diſcover themſelves not to be ſo; and this is a thing too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent. There are indeed thoſe <hi>Hypocrites</hi> who deceive the People of God, and act Godlineſs ſo ſpeciouſly, that they are not diſcovered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but there are others, who for all their ſtickling and noiſe, do yet expreſs ſuch vanity, and want of any favour of Piety in their lives, that give, at leaſt to diſcerning Chriſtians, if not to others, juſt reaſon to ſuſpect that <hi>the root of the matter</hi> is not in them: ſuch an one was <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> unto whom <hi>Peter</hi> plumply ſaith, Acts 8.23. <hi>I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterneſs, and bond of iniquity.</hi> He that no hath grace, cannot be ſaid to have the power of it in him: ſuch then as lead Unregenerate Lives, ſay that they are ſuch, Pſal. 36.1. <hi>The tranſgreſſion of the wicked ſaith in mine heart, there is no fear of God before his eyes</hi>; and yet ſuch as theſe <hi>flatter themſelves</hi>; ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſe 2.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When men make a great ſtir about
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:000963_0025_0FADE524D36E3670"/>
Godlineſs, and yet there is very little of the life of it appeareth in their Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Theſe do not proceed ſo far as the other in diſcovering themſelves; they do ſomething in proſecution of their profeſſion, and Godly men have charitable hopes concerning them; but yet they are rather <hi>Negative</hi> than <hi>Poſitive,</hi> becauſe they act ſo faintly and irreſoulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in all they do. If there be the <hi>root of the matter</hi> in them, yet the activity of it is very little: a ſmall temptation allureth them, a little oppoſition diſhear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneth them; they give too much ſcope to themſelves in things which they plead a liberty for; and every trial is ready to lay them open, and diſcover their irreſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution: whereas, if Piety were powerful in them, it would not be ſo. Now it is the former of theſe which our Text more immediately and directly aimeth at, however we need not to exclude the latter; and here we may take a more diſtinct account of thoſe things wherein this ill ſtate or frame of Profeſſors doth appear, for our help to judge of our ſelves, and of the times we live in.</p>
                  <p>There are then theſe things which are

and the reaſon of it is, becauſe the grace which is in the children of God is too often overcome with the remaining corruption which is in them, and hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them from doing that which they would.

There is no man that is really God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but ſuch an one as hath received the Spirit of God, who dwelling in him by his Grace, efficaciouſly enableth him to ſerve and glorifie God, by believing in Chriſt, and following of Holineſs: &amp; where this great change hath not paſt upon the man, he is not Godly, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains under the powerful dominion of ſin and impiety.</p>

A man may be in a ſtate of nature, and yet I ſhould ſin if I judged him to be ſo; and he may be in a ſtate of Grace, and yet it may be my duty to be ſuſpicious about him; and the ground or reaſon of this lieth before us plain in our Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe a man may have the higheſt and moſt commendable form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and yet be utterly a ſtranger to the power of it: now the former of theſe is open and manifeſt; it is expoſed to publick view, and every one may ſee it, whereas the latter is ſecret, and hidden from men, and known only to God, and the mans own Conſcience. <hi>David</hi> had an excellent eſteem for <hi>Achitophel</hi> before he diſcovered himſelf, Pſal. 55.13, 14. <hi>mine equal, my guide, and mine acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; we took ſweet counſel together, and walked to the houſe of God in company</hi>; and he did not amiſs ſo to think of him. The <hi>Diſciples</hi> were more ready to ſuſpect each one himſelf than <hi>Judas</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="unknown:000963_0066_0FADE54FD554C120"/>
when Chriſt told them that <hi>one of them ſhould betray him</hi>; and they were not to be blamed for it. <hi>Paul</hi> was much endeared to <hi>Demas,</hi> and made uſe of him in his Travels and Miniſtry, and it was right for him ſo to do: and yet all theſe were ungodly men, and their hearts were unſound all this while. A man may carry it among men with greateſt forwardneſs and conſtancy in outward performances, follow all the means of grace in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon, and carry it very reverendly at them, diſcourſe very knowingly and loftily about the myſteries of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, pray like an <hi>Angel,</hi> highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the ways of God, be very cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect in his words and actions, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding charitable and honeſt in his Dealings with men, diligent in the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that God hath ſet him in; and yet his <hi>heart</hi> all this while <hi>not righs with God,</hi> but he may purſue it for by and ſiniſter ends, and upon pittifully mean motives: and yet make no diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of this falſeneſs to us, or of any thing that ſo contradicts his profeſſion as ſhould undermine our Charity: how
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:000963_0067_0FADE55069C46DB8"/>
then ſhould we look on him as any other than a Saint? when yet he may be a Devil, or a <hi>Wolf in ſheeps cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>; a meer Hypocrite. Hence no wonder, if good and wiſe men are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times forced to change their opinions about men, as <hi>David</hi> did reſpecting <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitophel</hi>; and the blame is not in them, but in thoſe that give the occaſion for it; and this may be a caution to Profeſſors, to beware how they build the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of their ſafe eſtate, upon the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thoughts of good and diſcerning men; they may often give ſhrewd gueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but yet they may be miſtaken in you: and remember that you muſt ere long be called to give an account of your ſelves to him who <hi>ſearcheth the hearts, and trieth the reins of men.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. We may here ſee a ſatisfying rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why ſome that have been <hi>Eminent Profeſſors,</hi> do afterwards prove <hi>fearful A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtates.</hi> That there have been ſome that have ſo done, we have awful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances left on Scripture Record: and we need look no farther for examples of this kind, than thoſe three who were
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:000963_0068_0FADE5511682BDB8"/>
mentioned under the former head, who in their time, were renowned for their profeſſion, highly advanced in the Church of God, and were accounted of by the beſt men they converſed with, and yet are left upon regiſter for their horrible-falls, and as awful inſtances of Gods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing Judgments. <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory</hi> alſo affords us plenty of ſuch examples in every Age of it. Now men may be apt to be amazed and wonder at it, and enquire how it comes to be ſo? and ſome have made miſimprovement of theſe inſtances, and endeavoured to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh from them, the falſe Doctrine of the <hi>total Apoſtaſy of the Saints,</hi> and to undermine the precious Doctrine of <hi>Perſeverance.</hi> But the truth in hand will direct us to a fair account of this matter, and render it a thing that needs not to be ſo much admired at. It is a certain truth, that none who have had the leaſt ſpark of ſaving grace in them, did ever utterly loſe it again. They have indeed fallen far, when it hath pleaſed God <hi>to leave them to themſelves, that he might try them, and let them know what is in them,</hi> and that it is <hi>by Grace that they ſtand:</hi>
                  <pb n="70" facs="unknown:000963_0069_0FADE552389E1848"/>
Such remarks are made upon <hi>David, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, Peter,</hi> and others. But ſuch woful Apoſtaſies as we are now conſidering of, are not a falling from true Grace, but a diſcovery that they never had it. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>th in the nature of the thing, and in the righteous judgment of God. If men take up an high profeſſion, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage themſelves in all the formalities of it, without a ſound principle within, or a root of ſaving Grace in the heart, they <hi>build upon the ſand without a foundation,</hi> and it is not to be counted a ſtrange thing, if a <hi>Storm</hi> of Temptation maketh that, ſpecious houſe to <hi>fall.</hi> Men that become Religious for baſe ends, and have ſome ignoble and fleſhly deſign in it, will ſooner or later find thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ends to ſail them, and ſomething or other to come athwart them, which will contradict the deſign they are
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:000963_0070_0FADE552AA0917D8"/>
driving, and then the efficacy of them ceaſeth. That Profeſſion that hath no life in it, will of it ſelf run out in a little time, and come to nothing if it be let alone. Beſides, there is nothing wherein God is more affronted, or his honour more reflected on, then by mens thinking to put him off with a ſhew, and to hide the deceitfulneſs of their hearts from him, as if it were poſſible for vain men to impoſe a cheat upon him: no wonder then if he, in his righteous judgment ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers them to lay aſide their vizar, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the world in their own true co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; leaves them to throw off the form, who took up contented with a meer form; and thereby God righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly lays them open to the view and diſcovery of men, who before had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them; and maketh their <hi>name to rot</hi> above ground whoſe only care had been to provide themſelves with a name on Earth. Let it not then ſtumble any ſerious Soul, when <hi>Tall Cedars fall,</hi> when great Profeſſors, and ſuch as have had a great name, come to nothing, and either turn aſide to <hi>damnable hereſies,</hi> or immerge themſelves in groſſeſt <hi>Immoralities</hi>: but

adore the wiſdom and holineſs of God, in laying men open, and making them to appear in their own colours; and let it be a ſolemn warning to ſuch as are ready to boaſt themſelves of their great profeſſion, and to grow confident there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon; and invite them, <hi>not to be high-mended, but to fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. This will let us ſee a reaſon why Gods awful Judgments do ſometimes break in upon a people which make a great Profeſſion. God muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to Govern all the Affairs of this world: all the evils and calamities that break in upon men at any time, are of his bringing, both as to the things themſelves, and the time of them. The Famines, Peſtilences, and Wars which overtake a people, and bring them low, and carry in them a witneſs of the Divine Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, are of his ordering; hence that, Amos 3.6. <hi>Is there any evil in the City, and the Lord hath not done it?</hi> Now theſe Calamities do not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall ſuch places and people as have not known God, nor had his name called upon them, but live without him, and
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:000963_0072_0FADE55423DA44B8"/>
drench themſelves in all manner of Enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, and heaven daring abominations: the light which is in the natural Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men, will eaſily ſatisfie them in the reaſon and equity of ſuch Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as theſe are, and men will rather wonder at the patience that bears ſo long with them, than the ſeverity which is exerciſed upon them. But the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation lieth on the other hand, and men are apt to be amazed at the Providence of God, which breaks in upon a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing people with terrible Judgments. When a people that are <hi>called by Gods Name,</hi> and are engaged in a profeſſion of his Worſhip, and make a great ſhew of zeal in it; they ſtand up for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the purity of it, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand thoſe that would introduce any Innovatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="74" facs="unknown:000963_0073_0FADE556F0507438"/>
of it, we may be ſatisfyed in the reaſon of this. I confeſs, it is hard to cenſure Gods Children individually, or perſonally for the afflictions which they meet with in their particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns; for the deſign of theſe is very often for their trial; ſuch were <hi>Jobs,</hi> and yet they were very ſharp and ſore: it would therefore be very inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to charge them as Hypocrites on this account. But, when God brings ſore and waſting Calamities of Sickneſs, Famine, and War, on a profeſſing peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and they are waſted and brought low by them, we are, according to the whole tenour of the Scriptures, to allot this to the anger of God; and God is not angry without a cauſe, <hi>Amos</hi> 3.4. <hi>Will a Lion roar in the forreſt, when he hath no prey</hi>? Now we may ſafely conclude that the Diſpleaſure which God hath taken at them, is not for their profeſſion it ſelf, or for their care to maintain the outward Forms and Ordinances, that he himſelf hath Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, and made the means of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him; hence that, Pſal 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This tells us, that if we would make a true judgment of Profeſſors, we muſt obſerve how their lives agree with their Profeſſion. It is true, men may in the management of their Profeſſion, carry it very fair, and behave themſelves ſo cunningly in their viſible Converſation, as to deceive the moſt judicious Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; but yet it is a frequent thing, and God ſhows his juſt and holy diſpleaſure at men, in ſuffering of it to be ſo, that thoſe who are <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and make a great noiſe in a <hi>form of Godlineſs,</hi> do in ſomething or other notoriouſly <hi>deny the power of it</hi>: not only do they ſometimes diſplay too much of ſinful folly and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, for ſo may the beſt of men do, whiles the <hi>law in their members</hi> hath ſo much of power and influence in them: but there is ſomething wherein they do egregiouſly diſcover their hypocriſy, and offer juſt grounds to ſerious Chriſtians to ſuſpect that all their formality, is nothing elſe but a piece of pageantry. <hi>Jehu</hi> did this, notwithſtanding his great zeal in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from the Idolatrous Worſhip of <hi>Baal,</hi> 2 Kings 10.

It is not enough to obſerve how a man carrieth himſelf in the houſe of God, or in his attendance on the obſervable Religious Duties that are pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed among Gods People; but we muſt follow him to his other, and ordinary converſation, and obſerve his carriage in that, how he behaves himſelf in his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular relations among men, and if theſe do not agree with the other, we have reaſon to be afraid that all is not as it ſhould be with ſuch a perſon.

It is true, the Symptoms of the Times are of two ſorts, <hi>viz.

Now by a right application of theſe, the times may be diſcovered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>they be good or evil, ſafe or perilous, and Chriſt reproves them for want of skill and obſervation in this regard, Mat. 16.3. <hi>ye hypocrites, ye can diſcern the face of the Skies, but can ye not diſcern the ſigns of the times.</hi>
               </p>

               <p n="1">1. There is a ſpecial <hi>Generation work</hi> lying upon every Chriſtian, according as the times are. It is true, every Child of God ought to endeavour to do the whole will of God, and to neglect no known duty at any time; we owe our whole life to his Glory, and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect all times are alike to us: but ſtill as the times change, the ſpecial and more peculiar deportments required
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:000963_0080_0FADE55B918C8DC0"/>
of Chriſtians do change with them; and hence there is one thing which is the work of one Generation, and ſomething elſe the work of another. It is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, that God commends <hi>Noah</hi> with this remark, Gen 7.1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>thee have I ſeen righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before me in this Generation.</hi> Which in part at leaſt, intends that he had Served him according to the preſent condition of the Generation he lived in. Hence it is ſaid of <hi>David,</hi> Acts 13.36. <hi>that he Served his own Generation by the will of God</hi>; and it is certain, that there was one work for <hi>David,</hi> to do in his time, and another for <hi>Solomon</hi> to do in his.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is every ones duty in his place, to <hi>thruſt into the gap,</hi> that he may keep off the evil threatned. When there are fad <hi>Prognoſticks</hi> of the times; when the Clouds begin to gather apace, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief apparently impends over a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing people; when Gods anger is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindled againſt them, and ſin hath o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened a wide gap for it to come in, and evil begins to croud in at it, all that fear God ſhould endeavour to pleaſe God, to pacifie his anger, and prevent
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:000963_0081_0FADE55C5E7AE310"/>
the miſchief: hence that Admonition given upon a threatning, <hi>Amos</hi> 4.12. <hi>thus will I do unto thee, Oh Iſrael; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, Oh Iſrael.</hi> There is a way to hold Gods hands, and turn away his diſpleaſure; we read that <hi>Moſes</hi> did ſo, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.23. and we find that God complains, that when he <hi>looked for ſuch an one, there was none</hi>; and he gives that as the reaſon why the torrent of his fierce Indignation brake in upon that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy people, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.30, 31. <hi>I ſought for a man,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>therefore have I poured mine indignation upon them.</hi> It is true, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one is not in an equal capacity to this work, or of doing alike publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, for the putting away of that ſin which is the provocation; there is a work lying upon perſons in Publick Place, ſuch as <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi> were, who may, if they are faithful, do a great deal upon this account. However, there is no Chriſtian, but if he be upright, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

aſſured us that he hath a reſpect for ſuch as theſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.2. <hi>to this man will I look, even to him that is poor, and of a contrite ſpirit, and that trembleth at my word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. They are the ſins of the times that make them peculiarly perilous. The great danger that a people are expoſed to, is from the anger of God which is kindled upon them: if he be pleaſed with them, they are ſafe, nor need they to be afraid of the threatning of the world; they have <hi>the name of God to run into, and that is a ſtrong tower, Prov.</hi> 18.10. But if God be diſpleaſed at them, and his wrath begins to wax hot, they now ly open to every miſchief; their defence forſakes them, and every evil will make a prey of them. Now, if God be diſpleaſed at a people, Sin always is the procuring cauſe of it: he taketh pleaſure in them whiles they do faithfully Serve him, <hi>his delight is in thoſe that fear him:</hi> but ſin is the thing that he cannot endure; and when he hath ſo warned them againſt it, as Jer. 44.4. <hi>Oh do not this abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

               <p n="4">4. Hence they that would prevent the danger, muſt do what in them lieth, to put away the ſins that have expoſed their people thereunto. They that would keep off threatned Judgments, muſt thruſt out the ſin that hath expoſed them thereto; the cauſe muſt be removed, if the effect be either prevented or made to ceaſe: all the other courſes that men can take, let them ſeem to be never ſo probable, will never avail, whiles this is neglected.

And there are uſually ſome peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar ſins which God bringeth his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for, and hath a ſpecial aim at. True, when God draws up an <hi>Indictment</hi> againſt a people, he puts a great many articles into it, as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22. but yet there is ſomething particular that he bears upon, as that which is leading to the other, and ſo carries a more aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted provocation in it. There are the cauſes and the beginnings of an Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy, which are not only ſins themſelves, but are chargeable as leading the way to all the reſt. When God cometh to root a people up for their ſins, they are grown to the height of provocation, as 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.14, 15. he uſed means to reclaim them, <hi>till there was no remedy</hi>; but other Judgments of his do often come upon places, when iniquity is not arrived to ſuch a prodigious height; and ſometimes God chargeth one, and ſometimes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the leading evil, thus Iſa. 57.17. <hi>for the iniquity of his Coveteouſneſs I wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we know what is the provocation, we ſhall not underſtand what is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant duty that God requires of us: the ſins muſt be found out, before they can be particularly provided againſt, and be ſuitably repented of, and turned from, and ſo the proper means be uſed for the putting of them away: and how ſhall this be but upon obſervation and ſearch? and that by taking notice what are the commands of God, and the Rules of his word; and viewing the frame and practice of men generally, &amp; comparing them herewithal? and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon want of conſideration is a thing which God looks upon as a great aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their ſins, and chargeth them with ſtupidity on the account of it, Iſa. 1.3. <hi>my people doth not conſider.</hi> Jer. 8.6. <hi>no man repented of his wickedneſs, ſaying, what have I done?</hi> and when God hath a controverſy with them, he invites them to conſideration, Hag. 1.5. <hi>now therefore thus ſaith the Lord, conſider your ways.</hi>

Formality, attended with denying the power of Godlineſs, is the firſt bad <hi>Symptom</hi> in a profeſſing people; we have obſerved, that Apoſtaſy from a fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is not wont to be all at once, but it hath its gradual ſteps, and may have many removes before it comes to the height: But all Apoſtaſy beginneth with the defect of the power and vigour of Grace in men. So that whatſoever will be an argument to diſcover mens decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from what they ſometimes main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, will alſo give evidence to their denying of the power; it being of it ſelf a practical contradiction of that pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which men would have the world to believe, that they do ſincerely profeſs.</p>
               <p>Here then let us take a brief proſpect of the <hi>frame</hi> and <hi>genius</hi> of this people on this account; and for our help in this neceſſary duty, let me offer at the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing remarks.</p>

If we look upon it as intending an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>ſpecies, ſhew or pretence,</hi> whether the thing it ſelf be ſincere, or only in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; it is certain that the generality of this people do give it out, that they are the people of God, that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge him to be their Soveraign, that they are engaged in his Service, and that they do ſtand up for the Goſpel Ordinances and Order. Or if we take it for the <hi>Rule</hi> that men declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be under the obligation of; we have a found <hi>confeſſion of the Faith,</hi> which we declare that we adhere unto; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

See how comfortably he ſpeaks to ſuch, Rev. 3.4. <hi>thou hast a few names even in Sardis, that have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed their garments, and they ſhall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.</hi> But if the other frame be grown too general and prevailing, the <hi>Symptoms</hi> are bad; and let us remember, that there are many diſcoveries which may be made of ſuch a ſpirit, which, though they are not all found in every one, yet if they are found diſtributively, and ſpread generally, it will amount to the thing that we are enquiring after. When God chargeth a people in this regard, he doth not always ſay you are all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The moſt publick Religious Worſhip which was at firſt performed by men, ſeems to have been in <hi>Families,</hi> before it came to be attended in the more open and frequented Aſſemblies, which is thought to have begun in the days of <hi>Enos,</hi> Gen 4 26. nor doth the making of this latter a duty now give men a diſcharge from the former any more than that did from ſecret Worſhip. The principal parts of <hi>Family Worſhip,</hi> are the <hi>Reading of the Scriptures</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi>; and the reaſon of it is, becauſe every Governour of a Family hath a charge lying upon him, to ſee to the Religious management of it, that ſo it may be a Family conſecrated to God.

                  <hi>Atheiſm</hi>; and yet there is lamentable complaint of this neglect even in this place, where there is ſo much of conviction offered unto men of their duty: and how many have there been, who, when God hath opened their eyes, and given them a true ſight of things, have bitterly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves, that they have lived in <hi>Prayerleſs Families?</hi> and that which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it to be the more doleful, is that they have not been the Families of

If there were that love for God, which men would be thought to have in them, they could not but ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſire to have acquaintance with him, and that would encourage them, yea, and ſtimulate them thankfully and induſtriouſly to husband ſuch rich oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities as are afforded them for this purpoſe.

Well, this may ſoon be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. What of the power of Godlineſs is recovered among us by all this? nay, what outward Reformation is there wrought by it? or are we not more ſtupid and ſenſeleſs under all? let us not account theſe remarks to be trifles, or things not worthy our enquiring after; but let us be ſerious in our obſervation; and if it be thus we may be ſure that we live in <hi>perilous times,</hi> and may by thus doing obtain the character of <hi>Prudent,</hi> for we are told, Prov. 27.12. <hi>the prudent foreſeeth the evil.</hi>

               <p>Conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It highly concerns every ſerious Soul, in perilous times, to ſecure himſelf. It is true, every one, as he is a Member of the Body, ought to do his utmoſt for the ſafety of the whole, for if the body ſuffer, he muſt expect to have a ſhare in it, which will be grievous; yea, and will be peculiarly ſo to his conſcience, if he hath not done his endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it; and we obſerved, that there is no Chriſtian, but hath more or leſs of advantage, in his place to do ſomething that way. But yet ſometimes all that he can do will not avail; <hi>Iniquity</hi> will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, and perils will grow on apace. Now there is a <hi>prudence</hi> which he ought to uſe, in ſeeking to ſave himſelf; and for that end to take the obſervation of the hazards which the publick is expoſed to, to awaken him to this duty, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the forecited, Prov. 27.13. <hi>the prudent foreſeeth the evil and hideth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> It was <hi>Noahs</hi> great wiſdom, that

he took the <hi>warning</hi> of the approaching Flood, and provided himſelf with an <hi>Ark</hi> againſt it came, whereby he was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when the world was drowned in a deluge, Heb. 11.7. God therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites his peculiar ones, to get into their Chambers before ſuch a time, Iſa. 26.20. <hi>Come my people, enter thou into thy Chambers, hide thy ſelf, till the indignation be over paſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 The Apoſtaſy, which denotes the times to be perilous, is laid in <hi>Individuals.</hi> The reaſon why the power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs decays in any place, is becauſe it doth ſo in this, and that, and the other particular perſon, and by this means it comes to be generally ſo: So that if every one in particular would carefully ſee to himſelf, and to his own heart and life, and endeavour to be upright with God, and put away his own ſin, there would be a general reformation, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion would again flouriſh in the vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

let others do as they will, he muſt ſee to it that he be not involved in the ſins of the times, which render them perilous: and he hath the more need of caution and reſolution on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count when ſuch ſins grow common, and there are a great many of evil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples that invite him to a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; on this account we have that precept, Exod. 23.2. <hi>thou ſhalt not follow a multitude to do evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a common intereſt in publick Calamities which ſuch times bring, which is unavoidable. Every man as he is a member of the whole, and hath his outward concerns in this life involved with them, cannot but be touched and afflicted with the evils which come upon the places they live in, and will, without doubt, feel much of the ſmart of them: and God is not to be charged with wrong dealing in his <hi>Providence,</hi> by reaſon of this, becauſe herein he treats with them as a <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi>; than which manner of treatment, there is nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> more agreeable to the common ſentiments, of humane reaſon,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:000963_0120_0FADE491D8D56FE8"/>
and is therefore practiſed, and juſtified a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men. If War, Sickneſs, Famine, break in upon a people, the good as well as the bad will feel the trouble of it; the thought whereof is a good incentive to us all to do our beſt to prevent them; and if they come, it ſhould engage us to be humble under them; hence how doth the Prophet reſent ſuch a time? Jer. 4.19. <hi>my bowels, my bowels, I am pained at my heart,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4 There is yet a way to keep clear of the ſins of the times which provoke God to bring ſuch Calamities; &amp; out of doubt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Child of God is concerned to think of, and endeavour it. There will be a vaſt difference in the Soul, or inward man, between being accuſed by our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in this regard, that we have contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them, and having a witneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that we have <hi>maintained our integrity,</hi> in the midſt of all the evil examples, &amp; temptations offered us to allure us from i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Pſal. 11.3. <hi>if the foundations be wholly overthrown, what hath the righteous man done?</hi> ſo ſome Tranſlations read it; <hi>q. d.</hi> he hath kept himſelf from the blame of it; and it was no ſmall inward relief to thoſe pious ones, who could in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally dark time, make that appeal, Pſal. 44.17, 18. <hi>All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee, neither have we dealt falſely in thy Covenant; our heart is not turned back, neither have our ſteps decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from thy way.</hi> Surely then, every one that fears God, and ſtudieth his own beſt intereſt, will take heed to himſelf in this regard.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And God hath ſome ſpecial favours in reſerve for them that thus do; though they may meet with much of trouble, yet there is a diſtinguiſhing diſpenſation of Gods Providence towards theſe at ſuch a time, though there be much of his holy Soveraignty acted in it, &amp; the difference which he puts between theſe, and thoſe who have been guilty of the Apoſtaſy, doth not always appear to the common view. Sometimes God ſtrangely preſerves them in times wherein his Judgments are diſpenſed among their people; thoſe great

Sometimes God merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly takes them away from the evil that is coming, and they are lodged ſafe in heaven before hand, Iſa. 57.1. <hi>the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous is taken away from the evil to come</hi>; and thus God accompliſhed his promiſe to Godly <hi>Joſiah,</hi> 2 Chron. 34.28. <hi>thou ſhalt be gathered to thy fathers in peace, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall thine eyes behold the evil that I will bring upon this place</hi>; and ſometimes,

yea very often, he reſerves ſpecial favours for the Children and Poſterity of ſuch; they ſhall have ſome remarkable bleſſings beſtowed upon them: thus God promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> Jer. 15.11. <hi>verily it ſhall be well with thy remnant</hi>; we find that God threatens to cut off the Poſterity of, and the very name of ſuch as are Ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaders in Apoſtaſy; ſee Jer. 29:32. <hi>he ſhall not have a man to dwell among this people.</hi> Whereas we have ſingular favours promiſed to the Succeſſors of thoſe that kept cloſe to God in times of the Decays of Godlineſs, ſee for this, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44 11.48.11.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hence it greatly concerns each of us to try our ſelves, how far we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally guilty of, or free from this Sin. If we be not careful on this account, we may deceive our ſelves; there are many ways in which we may contract Guilt upon this account; and how deeply ſhould it abaſe us when it is ſo? and if by the Grace of God, we have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, it will be matter of inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation under the greateſt troubles that are before us. But how ſhall we know this, but by a diligent ſelf ſearch? Let us

then, at ſuch a day as this is, be very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious and curious about it; and here let us in general obſerve, that it is not enough for us to cry out of the evil of the times, and make a great many of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical complaints about the degeneracy of the age, and the decays which are come upon Religion, and lay abundance of blame on this account, on this or that perſon, or order of men among us; there is a great deal of this <hi>zeal</hi> to be ſeen and heard proceeding from ſuch as are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently themſelves not a little guilty on this account: yea, ſuch is the <hi>deceitfulneſs of ſin</hi> that is lodged within us, that if we take not the more heed to our ſelves, it will draw us to hide our own formality and hypocriſy, under this very diſguiſe; and thereby, not only blind others with it, and cheat them in a good opinion of us, whiles we cover our ſin with it, but put a cheat too upon our own Souls, by perſwading our ſelves that this heat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a ſincere heart, when it is a meer impoſture. Give me leave then to offer a few <hi>Rules</hi> of <hi>Trial,</hi> and let us deal faithfully with our own Souls in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of them.</p>

               <p n="1">1. There is an external part of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on required of us by God.

Now there are many that make nothing of this, but can take up with any form: and if there be any who pretend Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to keep cloſe to what God hath revealed of his mind in this reſpect, and not to dare to go beyond it, they are ready to charge Hypocriſy on them; but let us conſider:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the moſt powerfully Godly, will be moſt Conſcientious in this matter. True, to ſtickle here, and to regard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, but in other things to lead a looſe Converſation among men, is enough to detect men of falſhood, and ſhews that it is not the fear of God which acts them in this regard. But it is a thing to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that God hath, in all ages of the Church, made his <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> the great <hi>Teſt</hi> of the <hi>External Obedience</hi> of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing people: and herein he hath aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his <hi>Prerogative</hi> to appoint what ſhall be the <hi>Media</hi> of Communion between him and them: and hereupon if we look into the affair<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Propheſies in the latter part of <hi>Ezekiels</hi> Viſions, have an eye to Goſpel times, and we there find how God ſpeaks to the Prophet, Ezek 43.11. <hi>Shew them the form of the houſe, and the faſhion thereof, and the goings out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms thereof, and all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances thereof, and all the Laws thereof.</hi> Again, there are ſome who are more careful than others in attending on exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal duties, they dare not to neglect them, or put them off upon vain pretences; and how many are there who condemn them for this as if they did it all but for a ſhew? that they read, hear, pray in their Families, and wait upon the publick Ordinances <hi>in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon,</hi> only to make men think them better Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans than others; whereas doubtleſs the moſt h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now the proper nature of Charity is to <hi>think the beſt</hi> of others, ſo far as we may have any encouragement ſo to do; ſurely then, when we ſee men to be zealous for the Ordinances of Chriſt, and careful in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to his commands therein, and therein ſhewing a reſpect to all his Precepts; this beſpeaks in our Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that they do well: and unleſs we have reaſon from their other converſation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, to condemn them, we ought to judge them ſincere; nor are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon infirmities incident to the Children of God in this life, to weaken our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity on this account. If we are miſtaken in this, it will do us no hurt, and <hi>to their own master they muſt ſtand or fall</hi>; but if we wrong them in our cenſures of them, we bring guilt upon our ſelves, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Gods juſt diſpleaſure againſt us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Have a care that you do not take up with, and reſt in a form of Godlineſs; and it concerns us all to take great heed to our ſelves on this account, and that upon theſe three conſiderations.</p>

but that you do give him ſpecial provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation thus to deal with you, and that it will be a righteous thing with him ſo to do. And, though it is not for us raſhly to judge of others, by the providences which paſs over them; but to be very ſober in our cenſures of men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they are ſtrangely viſited; yet men have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to call themſelves to a ſtrict account<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when Gods hand ſo lieth upon them: and how often may they be able to lay their finger on this ſore.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The thing it ſelf is unreaſonable. Of all the men in the world, the formaliſt acts the moſt irrationally, and contrary to the very ſentiments of common reaſon: and if you would but ponder on the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter according to the <hi>Principles of the light of nature,</hi> it would afford you ſufficient conviction of your egregious folly: either the Religion which you thus formally profeſs, is worthy of your cordial em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of, or it is not; if it be not, why then do you take up ſo much as a form of it? if it be, why then no more but a form? <hi>Out of your own mouth</hi> you will be one day judged in this matter. If Godlineſs be the way to eternal life, it
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:000963_0155_0FADE51091C75888"/>
requires your cordial &amp; ſincere profeſſion of it; if it have nothing of ſaving good in it, nor will profit you for happineſs, why will you, by a formality, hinder your ſelves of that which you think will do you good? The lewd ſinner, who pretends to nothing more, but to ſeek his happineſs in this life, and expects it from the fruition of the World, and thereupon giveth ſcope to himſelf, to take all the carnal ſatisfactions in it, which he can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract out of it, acts more according to <hi>Principles</hi> than you. He that cannot give a good reaſon why he ſhould be through and upright in the practice of Holineſs, cannot give one why he ſhould take up a form of it. And if you conceive an excellency in the form; reaſon ſhould tell you how much more excellent the power of it muſt be: let me then ſay as he, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.21. <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="2">2. To thoſe that are truly Godly: be you Exhorted to preſerve the power of Godlineſs in times wherein there is little of it to be found. And to move you hereto, Conſider;</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="157" facs="unknown:000963_0156_0FADE511DC379E18"/>1. The Glory of God is now peculiarly concerned in your ſo doing. When there are but a few that ſeek his honour, it is a ſpecial call to all ſuch as are truly Godly, to ſtand up and appear for it. Certainly, if you have any ſpark of real goodneſs in you, if you prefer the Glory of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, and do cordially deſire that all men would ſeek it, it cannot but put you upon being the more careful to your ſelves about it. When the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath but a <hi>few Friends</hi> in the world, and there are ſo many that diſhonour him, they that are indeed his friends, are loudly call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> upon the more eminently to appear ſo; and you cannot otherwiſe ſhew your ſelves <hi>true and faithful</hi> to him. When there were a great many pretended Diſciples that deſerted Chriſt, and <hi>walked no more with him,</hi> he put that cloſe queſtion to the twelve, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.67. <hi>Will ye alſo go away?</hi> When the <hi>Ten Tribes</hi> revolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the true worſhip of God, and turned aſide to <hi>Jeroboams</hi> Superſtition and Idolatry, God gave that admonition to the Kingdom of <hi>Judah, Hoſ.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Though thou Iſrael play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend.</hi> And when the body of that people had
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:000963_0157_0FADE51743432CB0"/>
turned from God, and made them a <hi>Golden Calf,</hi> and proſtrated themſelves to that, <hi>Moſes</hi> calls aloud to the people, as, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.26. <hi>Who is on the Lords ſide? let him come unto me.</hi> And we find that the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> preſently appeared, and they obtained a bleſſing upon it. Hereby is a ſpecial advantage afforded you, to approve your ſelves ſincere, and upright in heart, and to bring much glory to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Your own comfort, in all changes, will be greatly helped by it. We have obſerved, that the beſt muſt look to meet with trouble, when God cometh to viſit a people for theſe things: nor can they tell how deeply they may perſonally ſuffer in ſuch times. However, there is a way by which the people of God may come to have much inward tranquility in their Souls, and be able to commit themſelves to God with a ſedate Spirit, when the Storms of Judgments are moſt furious, and <hi>Sinners in Zion are afraid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and fearfulneſs ſurprizeth the Hypocrites</hi>: and this is worth our utmoſt endeavour, and the peace of it will make full amends for all the labour we can uſe about it. And I am ſure that there is nothing that will more largely
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:000963_0158_0FADE51884C99DD0"/>
contribute hereto than this, <hi>viz.</hi> the Teſtimony of our Conſciences to our ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, in ſtanding by, and upholding the power of Godlineſs, in the moſt degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate times. This will give rejoycing in the greateſt afflictions that can befall us. <hi>Paul</hi> ſets a <hi>Probatum eſt</hi> upon this, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Our rejoycing is this, the teſtimony of our Conſcience, that in ſimplicity and Godly ſincerity, we have had our Converſation in the World.</hi> This will help to fix our hearts in times when the moſt threatning <hi>Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms</hi> of evil appear, and the Clouds are gathering thick and faſt: So it is with him who is upright. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 112.7, 8. <hi>He ſhall not be afraid of evil tidings; his heart is fixed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> truſting in the Lord: his heart is eſtabliſhed he ſhall not be afraid.</hi> Whereas the want of this integrity, or ſome noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious defect in it, touching the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and making it to reflect upon the man, will offer more inward moleſtation, and hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t diſquietment, than all the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward troubles which he can encounter withal.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You will meet with great <hi>Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> which will offer to diſcourage you at ſuch a time. What they are hath been
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:000963_0159_0FADE518D068BAB8"/>
before taken notice of; and let Godly ones who <hi>have the root of the matter in them,</hi> beware of deſpiſing this warning, or thinking themſelves out of the reach of theſe Temptations. Godly men have a corrupt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> part remaining within them, which they do find work enough to ſuppreſs at any time, and it will certainly take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to urge hard, when it hath motives from without to back its ſuggeſtions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all: nor will all your Confidence ſecure you againſt the aſſaults of it, but it will be too hard for you, if you be not very headful to your ſelves. You have awful inſtances of this to give you warning. <hi>Peter</hi> for all his reſolution, and repeated purpoſes, was yet fearfully over come when the tryal was upon him. <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. <hi>Barnabas</hi> was drawn into a Scandalous diſſimulation, when <hi>Peter</hi> had begun, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.12. You had need to be well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, if you will ſtem the ſtream of the times, and hold out againſt all that would allure you from your fidelity to Chriſt, when you may be called to part with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing elſe, though never ſo dear to you, if you will preſerve your integrity immaculate; and for your help on this account.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="161" facs="unknown:000963_0160_0FADE51990F08858"/>1. See to your hearts that they be <hi>right</hi> in all that you do in your profeſſion. If God mainly <hi>regards the heart,</hi> it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns all that would approve themſelves to him, to do ſo too. If you can once get them to be right, your main buſineſs is done, and till you have made this ſure, you cannot do any thing well. <hi>See then to your through Converſion</hi>; that indeed is not all that you have to do, but it is the firſt thing, becauſe there can nothing be done right without it. It is impoſſible that an unconverted heart, ſhould be a ſincere heart in Gods account and acceptance; till you have gotten a new heart, you can never go beyond formality in any thing you do; and if you would have ſuch an heart as this, you muſt go to God for it: It is he alone who can give it to you, and you muſt ask it of him, <hi>Ezek</hi> 36.26. <hi>a new heart will I give you</hi> You muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo call for your heart, every time that you go about any duty, and be ſure to take it along with you, if you would be cordial in it; it will be away, if you do not heedfully look after it; and too often doth a Godly man perform this and that Service in formality, becauſe of his inadvertency in this regard; or becauſe

he truſts his heart too much, which a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Set your ſelves ever in the preſence of God, as of one who ſeeth and hateth Hypocriſy. We are indeed forbidden to do <hi>eye-ſervice</hi> to men, as of a thing which proceeds from a falſe heart; but eye-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to God is every where approved; and there is nothing that can be a more powerful and awful conſideration on our minds, to make us afraid of doing any thing in hypocriſy, than to think of thoſe two things, and always carry the deep impreſſion of them upon our hearts, <hi>viz.</hi> that God ſtands by, and looks on, and that he cannot abide diſſimulation; for he is our Law giver, and our Judge, who will call us to an account, and he will judge righteous Judgment, and cannot be miſtaken in it. Hence holy men on Scripture Record, have always been wary of this, when they were in a right frame, and made uſe of it as a caution to excite them to ſincerity; thus did <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 31.4. <hi>Doth not he ſee my ways, and count all

my ſteps</hi>; and <hi>David</hi> ſaith, Pſal. 16.8 <hi>I have ſet the Lord always before me.</hi> It is therefore the character of wicked men, that they think not of God, Pſal. 10.4. <hi>God is not in all his thoughts</hi>; and they ſuppoſe him to be unconcerned about the affairs of the children of men, and ſo not to be feared, Ezek. 8.12. <hi>They ſay, the Lord ſeeth us not, the Lord hath forſaken the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Maintain and ſtrengthen your <hi>love to God,</hi> and his ways. See that you have this principle in you: where this love is not, the beſt that you do will be but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality; and you had need to be always nouriſhing this principle in you, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it coroborated: you will meet with many things that will offer to damp it. If you can but attain to do every thing in true love to God, delighting in his ways, and deſiring his glory above all things, this will be the beſt help to do all things uprightly; this will make you ſee to the matter, and manner, and principle, and end, that all be accommodated to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical directions and deſigns; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtrength and activity of this love in you, ſuch will be the power of
