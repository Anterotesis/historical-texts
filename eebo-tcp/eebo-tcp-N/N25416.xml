            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>LETTER I. From Miſs <hi>POLLY GRANVILLE,</hi> to Miſs SOPHIA DANIELSON.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Miſs Sophia,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU know that Mr. Danford, of late, has paid his addreſſes to me; and you know, likewiſe, that he is a man worthy of any body's eſteem. I am ſure he had engaged all my affections; and we had got ſo far in our courtſhip, that we had promiſed marriage to each other: But my father, for ſome family conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, hath engaged Mr. Stapleton to addreſs me. Now Mr. Stapleton is very wealthy, but he is quite ill looking: I believe you never ſaw him. Well, I will try to let you know how he looks. He is a tall figure of a man; has very large coarſe features, and a dead looking eye; with hollow cheeks, large irreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular teeth, and a mouth no ways beſpeaking approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Indeed he is a frightful looking man as to his perſon. He is, beſides, of a violent temper, and hath no conſideration in any matter whatſoever. He ſpeaks quick, and talks much, without ſenſe, or method; is quite a libertine; is very fond of company; and no company comes amiſs to him. And, indeed, he is altogether a debauchee. Now could you think your Polly could be fond of ſuch an alliance? No. What, to exchange Mr. Danford, who has every perſonal qualification, for ſuch a creature as this? No, I won't! for I will die firſt! Beſides, I would not break my
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033734_0004_0FF8BF66EBBD8A50"/>
promiſe, that is of ſuch a nature, for all the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and there is nothing ſhall tempt me to break it!</p>
            <p>My mother and I have had a long diſcourſe on the ſubject, and I find I am not to expect much favour from my father in this affair; and my mother ſeems to ſide with him, at preſent. I will ſend you the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe I had with my mother; which was nearly as follows:</p>
            <p>My mother called me to her, and upon my ſeating myſelf by her, ſaid, Polly, do you intend to favour the addreſſes of Mr. Danford any longer, or have you diſmiſſed him already? Dear mamma, ſaid I, I have not diſmiſſed him at preſent; and why ſhould I? I hope you have no objections to his viſits; have you? Yes, Polly, ſaid my mother, I have: and if I ſhould only tell you that it is diſagreeable to me, it ought to be a ſufficient reaſon for you to diſmiſs him. But I will give you ſome reaſons why I wiſh you to break with him. It is high time that you knew your own importance. For prithee, child, don't you know that you are nobly deſcended; that our family is one of the oldeſt in the country; and that your father is very wealthy, having a large eſtate in his hands; is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſely rich in money and lands; and carries on an extenſive trade at ſea; and is called one of the firſt men on the continent? Now Mr. Danford's circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances being but moderate, no ways equal to yours, it cannot be thought that you will ſtoop ſo low as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his viſits; much leſs to encourage any further alliance with him. It is therefore your father's pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure that you break with him; and ſo it is mine. For your ſiſter Jenny married a man that was exceeding wealthy, and you was always looked upon above her, both in beauty and accompliſhments of mind, and it is in your power to make the richeſt man in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try happy: So I hope you will not diſpleaſe your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nor vex me, for I never had a child that I ſet more by than I do by you. Neither ſhould try harder to make any child happier in a wealthy marriage, than I ſhould you. And now, I think I have given you ſufficient reaſons, why I think it will be beſt for you
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033734_0005_0FF8F07D32FD3130"/>
to break with him. And I am ſure I would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you to any thing that is not for your good.</p>
            <p>Dear ma'am, ſaid I, you greatly ſurpriſe me; for I had not the leaſt thought that Mr. Danford was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtful to you; for you never hinted a ſyllable of it to me before—and he engroſſes all my attention. And my inclination is too ſtrongly biaſſed in his favour to admit of an alteration. Neither can I ſee why you ſhould deſpiſe him: For Mr. Danford is every thing that I could poſſibly wiſh for in a man. He is of a noble mind, is above every little action—is of a kind and affable diſpoſition, and has a heart not ungenerous. He ſeems to be formed both to defend and love the other ſex; and indeed there is nothing of meanneſs in him: For he has acquired great honour in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his country, as a public officer; and is in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of a good eſtate, his circumſtances being quite eaſy. And indeed great riches never had ſuch charms with me! 'Tis true, where there is riches, it enables one to be kind and benevolent to the poor and needy. But to love riches for the ſake of grandeur, and that only, characterizes a low and little mind, and bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders on ſelfiſh ſtupidity. But, ma'am, you know that I always was of a ſerious turn of mind, and I think I have ſome love for religion; nor do I confine my ideas of happineſs to this world; but my ſchemes of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are chiefly beyond the grave. Now, Mr. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford is of a conſonant turn of mind, being a great lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of religion, which is beautifully mixed in all his diſcourſe; and, in my mind, ſets him above the richeſt man on earth, who is void of his qualifications. And then, when he talks of love, or marriage, it is with that open frankneſs, that ever denotes the noble mind. And from him, you never hear any of that frantic diſorder of ſpeech: but perſuaſion ſeems to dwell on his tongue, in a juſt and noble manner. And can you think, that ſuch an alliance as this can be diſagreeable to me? An alliance that will not end at death, but will endure when the ſun and moon ſhall forget to ſhine? O what a rich thought is this; that we may be mutual helps to each other in this world, and then be removed to the realms of joy and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033734_0006_0FF8F08502D8B6C8"/>
never to be parted again! And would you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me of the anticipation of all this happineſs, and ſink me below the duſt? For I never ſhall be happy with any other man; becauſe we have pledged ourſelves to each other. And as for Mr. Murfee, who married Jenny, 'tis true, he is in poſſeſſion of a large eſtate; but then, he is altogether a man of this world. And indeed he is nothing more than a faſhionable rake— a profeſſed libertine. If ſhe feels herſelf happy with him, it is well. But it is hardly ſuppoſable that ſhe does? But if we may judge by appearances, ſhe is very uneaſy in her mind; and does not rejoice in her noble marriage: And now, would you have me tied to another, ſuch as Mr. Murfee is? If I was, I ſhould bid farewel to all enjoyments in this world; and moſt ſet down miſerable for life: And then, what avail would riches and grandeur be to me? Why, they would only ſerve to heighten my miſery, and augment the troubles of life to a greater degree.</p>
            <p>Polly, ſaid my mother, you ſeem to branch out ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry largely; but I hope you are not in earneſt: for your father, of late, had ſome overtures made to him by Mr. Stapleton on your account; which I think cannot be diſagreeable to you. For he is a very wealthy man, indeed; there is hardly any end to his riches. And he is a man well enough as to other qualifications. And now what objections can you have to him?</p>
            <p>Dear mamma, ſaid I, don't mention Mr. Stapleton to me for ſuch an alliance; for he is a frightful look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing man, and has nothing attractive in his behaviour; being quite void of that tenderneſs to be found in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others. And then there is nothing noble in his mind, or generous in his temper. And indeed, he ſeems to be formed by nature for a mere tyrant. For having a churliſh ungovernable temper, and not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſe enough to know right from wrong; he is many times in a paſſion, without knowing what he is angry at. And, above all, he is a great libertine, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for nothing but debauchery. Now, could you have a ſingle thought of ſuch a man for your Polly? Dear ma'am, you cannot! For I had rather live a
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033734_0007_0FF8F0874362AB30"/>
ſingle life all my days, or marry a man without any eſtate at all, provided he is endowed with perſonal qualifications, than to have him. For it is eaſier for a poor man, thus qualified, to attain to an eſtate, than for a rich, ſelfiſh clown, to attain to thoſe qualifications. So I hope you won't mention him to me any more.</p>
            <p>Well, Polly, ſaid my mother, you had better think ſeriouſly of the matter; for your father is determined that Mr. Danford ſhall not continue his viſits; and has wrote him a line to forbid him our houſe. I I think you had better encourage the addreſſes of Mr. Stapleton; for your father is ſet upon it, to give him all the aid in his power. For there is to be ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of property between your father and Mr. Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton, in conſequence of your marriage, which will be very advantageous to our family. And ſo, I fear, he is too much ſet to be turned. For Mr. Stapleton being very wealthy, he thinks 'twill reflect great hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our on the family. But I ſhall not ſay any more to you at preſent.</p>
            <p>Dear ma'am, ſaid I, let me juſt anſwer you before you withdraw. Then the matter is concluded alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, I find. And I am to be ſold to Mr. Stapleton, to be his ſlave. For if I am married to him, no other ſhall I be, I warrant. But I never will be neither his wife, nor ſlave! For if I cannot have a man of my own chooſing, I had rather never alter my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. But if I am ever married, Mr. Danford muſt be the man: indeed he muſt! Dear mamma, do ſtand my friend! And don't inſiſt on my breaking with Mr. Danford, for my life depends upon it! and if you are not my friend, I am wholly deſtitute of any except Mr. Danford. And you ſay I am not to ſee him again. O ſhocking! Then I am to be plunged into diſtreſs and miſery at an early age. And how can you ſay that you love me above any of your rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when you do not care what befals me? Which denotes you don't love me at all. But you will love your Polly yet, will you not? And will you not try to perſuade my father to deal otherwiſe by me?— But if you will forſake me, I have no where to go but to a merciful God; on whoſe care and protection I
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033734_0008_0FF8F08D1F89B330"/>
will ever venture myſelf, hoping he will not lay more on me, than I am able to bear.</p>
            <p>At this my mother withdrew, and now what have I to expect but hard treatment? Well, 'tis hard to diſobey parents; but, as for my marrying Mr. Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, I never will, let what will come of it. Neither will I marry any other man whilſt Mr. Danford is living. For how can I, we having promiſed each other not to? which promiſes I hold to be ſacred; and that no body hath a right to revoke them. And ſo you ſee, that I am ſtedfaſtly ſet, to hold my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe with Mr. Danford. But I cannot tell yet how it will be brought about.</p>
            <p>By this time you will think it is time for me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, which I do by ſending you my kind regards.</p>

            <p>AND am I forbidden to viſit you? Yes, I received a line from your father, which forbids me his houſe. On what account I cannot tell; but have heard, by the bye, that it is becauſe my eſtate is not large enough. And I hear farther, that Mr. Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton is encouraged to viſit you; and I ſuppoſe his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate is ſufficient, and that is all he has to recommend him. But I ſhould not think that my Polly (you ſee that I call you mine yet) would take up with ſuch a wretch as Mr. Stapleton, who is void of every good quality. And then, my dear, what have I done to your father? For if I am guilty of any enormity that
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033734_0009_0FF8F08F5A063F28"/>
is offenſive to him, if he will but hint it to me, I will amend; and ſhall be very proud to gain his affections at any rate, let it coſt me what it will. And indeed, I ſhould be willing to ſeek danger in the face of ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born foes, if that would reconcile him to me. But I fear his diſguſt is of another nature. For I believe that nothing but money is wanting. As for an eſtate, I have enough of that to make us comfortable, and I don't think we ought to let the world engroſs all our deſires.</p>
            <p>And now, my dear, are your affections alienated from me? Or have you forgot me? You uſed to ſay that you had ſome eſteem for me, and that I was delightful to you. And indeed you promiſed to be mine, let what would be the conſequence. And may not I expect a line from you to inform me of the ſtate of your mind towards me. As to myſelf, my love to you is, and ever will be, the ſame it ever was. Don't think that abſence will, or can efface it. No; but if the ſun ſhould forget to ſhine, or the rivers for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to flow, then might I forget my Polly Granville, but not otherwiſe. Nor will the trials and troubles of this world make me unmindful of you. And I am reſolved never to marry any other whilſt you are liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But how you will behave yourſelf to me, is yet uncertain. But I always did depend on your word and promiſe, and think I may yet.</p>
            <p>As for an eſtate, don't let that trouble you; for if your father ſhould diſinherit you, yet I have a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petence of this world; and if I can but have your perſon, I do not care whether your father gives you any thing or not. For riches, abſtractly of themſelves, will never make a perſon happy; and I ever loved you more for the beauties of your mind, than any thing elſe. Your being of an open temper, that ever ſets the noble above the low minded, and having a love for virtue and religion, and not confining your ideas of happineſs wholly to this world, greatly height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened you in my eſteem, for I am myſelf, of a conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant turn of mind. How pleaſing was the anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe things to me; that we ſhould be able to give advice and counſel to one another, which would
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033734_0010_0FF8F093404722F0"/>
mutually heighten the thoughts of heaven, even whilſt in this ſtate of change and viciſſitude; and finally, that our friendſhip ſhould not end at death, but that we ſhould be partakers of that bleſſedneſs which is laid up for thoſe who make virtue their chief aim.— But I cannot, and will not give you up as loſt to me yet, For there are many intricate windings in life, which appear to us to be wholly againſt us; yet at the ſame time are working together for our good. And the perſon that puts his truſt wholly in a divine Providence, is ſeldom diſappointed. For Providence can overcome all theſe ſeemingly untoward obſtacles, and make them all turn to our advantage; and then we can can look back with delight on thoſe ſeeming afflictions, and can ſee how they did work together for our good.</p>
            <p>I ſhall depend upon a letter from you: and pray write whether your affections are unalterable to me or not; and at the ſame time you may aſſure yourſelf, that I am unalterably your's,</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IS it poſſible that you ſhould diſtruſt the love and fidelity of your Polly? No, I'll not harbour ſuch a thought—I think you are not capable of ſuch a thing. And do you aſk whether my love is the ſame towards you? I anſwer, no; for the unthought-of trials that I have met with of late, have greatly heightened my love and affection to you. My eſteem for you is altogether unalterable, and my heart is fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033734_0011_0FF8F099C5562A48"/>
Neither is there any thing in this world that ſhall alienate my affections from you; and you may aſſure yourſelf that I am unalterably yours, and never will I marry any other man whilſt you are living: Let the trials and trouble I meet with be ever ſo great, yet I will never break this reſolution. For you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think that I ſet ſo light by the promiſe I made you as to break it, for any conſideration whatſoever. But I have experienced great troubles, and heavy tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, ſince I ſaw you, which are on your account: and I expect they are not at an end yet. But this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion makes them the lighter, that they are on your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: and I am willing to ſuffer greater trials for your ſake, if I can but obtain your perſon. So you may ſee by this that you are no ways indifferent to me; but that you engroſs my whole attention, as to the things of this world; my worldly happineſs being wholly centered in you.</p>
            <p>I would give you, if I could, a ſketch of my trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. My father hath forbid my receiving your viſits, and I ſuppoſe forbidden you his houſe, and hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe propoſed Mr. Stapleton to me as a ſuitor; but I have utterly refuſed to have any thing to ſay to Mr. Stapleton on ſuch an account. And have peremtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, that if I could not be favored with an alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with you, I would never alter my condition: which ſeems to raiſe great anger in my father: for it ſeems (tho' it is hard to ſay it of one's parents) that my father ſets more by riches, than he does by the peace and quiet of his children. It ſeems that Mr. Stapleton is to pay me a viſit; but it will be labour loſt; I can tell them that: for I am determined not to have any thing to ſay to him on the ſubject; and I will warrant, he will get nothing but frowns from me. For if my affections were not fixed already, I could not think of Mr. Stapleton for a companion—indeed I could not; for he is no ways engaging to me, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in perſon or behaviour. And then his mind is altogether naughty; and, in my view, he is not in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of one good quality. So, if I was not biaſſed in your favour, you may ſee he would not be likely to make a conqueſt of me. But to return; my father
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033734_0012_0FF8BF71A85D1D58"/>
hath not confined me to my chamber yet; though he ſays he will, if I don't comply with his propoſal. But I have liberty of the garden, and to viſit, having one of the family with me, to ſee that I am not in your company. I am alſo allowed to write; and my maid being wholly on my ſide, I can convey my letters when, and where I pleaſe: So you may leave your letters, and ſhe will call for them.</p>
            <p>Your letter to me revived my ſpirits greatly. To think, that you don't deſpiſe, nor forget me in this trouble, is a great conſolation to me. And your hint, that "they who put their truſt in Providence, will not be diſappointed," gave me great encouragement; for my whole dependence is on a kind indulgent Providence; in whoſe hands I am willing to venture myſelf, and all my concerns. Ever praying that he will not lay greater trials on me than he ſhall enable me to bear, and that I may, in ſome meaſure, be blameleſs.</p>

            <p>I MUST write to you, becauſe to my Miſs So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia I can write without the leaſt reſerve. Perhaps you will think that I write without ſenſe or method. But then, when I write to you, I wiſh to unboſom my whole mind; knowing that you will make proper al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances for my imperfections. Well, I have a great many ſtrange things to tell you, for I am uſed with great ſeverity by my parents; who try all in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to make me break with Mr. Danford, and favour
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033734_0013_0FF8F09E5520E3C8"/>
Mr. Stapleton<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I utterly refuſe to do either, which vexes them greatly.</p>
            <p>Mr. Stapleton has paid us a viſit, and you will wiſh to know how I behaved myſelf with my new lover, and how he conducted in the buſineſs. Why, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that we both behaved quite aukwardly. I am ſure he did; and I have not much to ſay for myſelf. Well, as my mother and I were ſitting in the parlour, who ſhould enter but my papa, and Mr. Stapleton with him, which put me in a terrible ſlutter. My papa introduced him to my mother, and then to me; and I aroſe to receive him—but tremble, tremble, went my feet, ſo that I could hardly ſtand. I hope, ſaid he, I ſee you well, Miſs Polly: very well, Sir, ſaid I; but did not ſay, at your ſervice, you may well think. Well, he ſeated himſelf not far from me, and ſeemed as if his ſeat was uneaſy to him. Now turning to this ſide, now to that; and ſeemed to be at a loſs what to ſay. But my father and mother put him out of his pain, by withdrawing: my father ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he went out, well, Polly, I have engaged Mr. Stapleton to viſit you, and I hope you will receive him kindly; and that you will be agreeable to him, and he to you. While my father addreſſed himſelf to me, I ſtood up, and when he had done, I courteſied, and ſet down again; and was in hopes, that when I ſhould tell Mr. Stapleton how the matter ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Mr. Danford and myſelf, that he would relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh all his pretentions to me, and would try to help me out of my preſent difficulty. But in this I found myſelf miſtaken; for the more I expoſtulated with him, the more he would claim his right by my father's engagement; ſo I was reſolved to uſe him very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to let him know, that I was determined to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to my promiſe to Mr. Danford. Well, as to our diſcourſe; after I had ſeated myſelf, he moved his ſeat nearer to me, and accoſted me as follows:</p>
            <p>Well, Miſs Polly, your father hath engaged me to addreſs you, and I hope that my viſits will meet with your approbation; for I ſhould be fond of an alliance with your family; and I hope I ſhall make myſelf as agreeable to you, as you are to me.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:033734_0014_0FF8F0A49BD4CD38"/>Sir, ſaid I, if it were in my power to receive your viſits, I ſhould be very glad to on my father's account, who hath given you the trouble to call upon me. But as I have a prior engagement, I hope you will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me, Sir, when I tell you, that I cannot diſcourſe with you on the ſubject. And I have more depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on your honour, Sir, than to think that you will try to make a young defenceleſs creature break her promiſe with another man. For you know, Sir, that ſuch an engagement is ſolemn, and ought to be held ſacred. And I have great dependence on your hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, Sir, in this affair; expecting you will not inſiſt on my favouring your pretenſions; and hope you will ſay no more to me on that ſubject.</p>
            <p>As I ſaid before, he is quite an unpolite gentleman, wherefore breaking in upon me, he ſaid, ma'am<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ma'am!—if you are agreeable to Mr. Danford, why ſhould not you be ſo to me? And no doubt, if Mr. Danford is agreeable to you, I can make myſelf equally agreeable. For we all know that affections are transferable. And beſides, I am vaſtly above Mr. Danford in every point of view. So I am no ways concerned, but that you will like me, in a little time, as well as you do him.</p>
            <p>But Mr. Stapleton, ſaid I, what ſhall I do with the promiſe I have made to Mr. Danford? for I have pledged myſelf to him in a ſolemn manner; and if I ſhould break that promiſe, I ſhould be afraid that ſomething uncommon would befal me. And what can you ſay to this?</p>
            <p>Love-promiſes, ſaid he, are nothing but words of courſe, and I have made a dozen of them in my life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time; but never thought them binding. And if you have made a promiſe to Mr. Danford, you know the form now: and ſo you may make another to me, and I will do the ſame to you, and we will join our hands at the church, and then the matter will be ſettled, and who can call you to an account about it?</p>
            <p>Mr. Stapleton, ſaid I, you ſurpriſe me! Do you make thus light of ſolemn promiſes? If theſe are your ſentiments, what ſecurity could a woman have with you? why you put me quite out of conceit of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033734_0015_0FF8F0A9751032B0"/>
the other ſex. But I hope they are not all of your turn of mind. And I am under the neceſſity of telling you, that you are no ways pleaſing to me; therefore wiſh you to withdraw, and not diſturb me with ſuch diſcourſe—for I muſt tell you, that I have no liking to you. And indeed, Sir, if I was not engaged, I could not think of a man of your ſentiments for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion—indeed I could not! And now, as I have been ſo plain with you, I hope you will give me no more trouble in this affair: for we being not of a conſonant turn of mind, cannot be agreeable to each other.</p>
            <p>Well, ſaid Mr. Stapleton, I ſhall not give up my pretenſions to you, for your father and I have ſettled the whole matter; and he having a right to command you, I ſhall depend upon his authority, and expect a ſpeedy marriage. For I have engaged ſo far in the affair, that I cannot eaſily give it up: and ſo you may as well comply, as not.</p>
            <p>Sir, ſaid I, may not I depend on your honour, when I tell you, that I cannot love you, and that you are wholly diſagreeable to me? If I ſhould conſent to give you my hand, what a life ſhould we be likely to live together? For, where there is no love, there can be no confidence: and then we might both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent our proceedings when it would be too late.</p>
            <p>I am, ſaid he, not at all concerned about that. For it is a wife's duty, to obey her huſband. And I ſhall take care of that in the firſt place, and then look out for your affections afterwards. And it will be ſtrange, if you cannot both love and eſteem me—for I have a large eſtate; and, you know, where there is riches, there muſt be contentment of mind. So I have no doubt, but, in time, you will both love and reſpect me; and I am reſolved to venture the conſequence, and doubt not, that we ſhall be married ſoon.</p>
            <p>Mr. Stapleton, ſaid I, you may rely upon it, that I will never be your wife whilſt I am living—neith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er do I intend to talk any more with you about the matter. Indeed, I did depend ſome upon your hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, but I find that you are void of that qualification. And to ſhow you that I am in earneſt in all that I
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033734_0016_0FF8F0AECD77F3C8"/>
have ſaid, I ſhall this moment withdraw, and leave you by yourſelf, hoping you will make proper reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on what hath been ſaid, and that you will give me no more trouble:</p>
            <p>And ſo I retired to my chamber. But my father and he had a long conference, after I withdrew. And, by what I can find out, by the bye, my father is determined to uſe all his authority, to make me comply with his propoſal. And, I believe, he told Mr. Stapleton as much—for ſince that time, he uſes me more like a ſtranger than a child: only with this difference, that he is not ſo polite with me, as he is with others.</p>
            <p>When we ſat down to tea, after Mr. Stapleton was gone—we having no company, his diſcourſe was whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about the above affair; and he ſaid, I was altogeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unpolite to Mr. Stapleton; but if I did not behave myſelf better to him, the next time he viſited me, he would uſe his authority with me: and if that would not make me bend, he ſhould take ſuch meaſures with me, as would be very diſtreſſing, both for him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, and for me to bear.</p>
            <p>I thought it beſt for me not to anſwer him, ſo made no reply to what he ſaid; but ſoon retired to my chamber again, and wrote you the reſult.</p>
            <p>And now, ma'am, what muſt I expect? Nothing but hard words and angry looks from them that ought to deal moſt kindly and tenderly by me. But I did not think my mother capable of hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs: for ſhe uſed to be very kind to me; indeed, ſhe never gave me an angry word before this affair happened. But I intend to have another diſcourſe with her. Pray, my dear Miſs Sophia, write to me, and tell me how one ought to behave to parents in ſuch a caſe as mine. I know one ought to obey parents in all things: But when Mr. Danford firſt addreſſed me, my parents ſeemed to encourage me in the affair; and now when my inclination has got ſtrongly biaſſed in his favour, and we have promiſed marriage to each other—and all done, as it were, through their concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, they can have no right, I think, to inſiſt upon my breaking with him, and admitting the viſits of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033734_0017_0FF8F0B1069C6200"/>
another, who is altogether diſagreeable to me. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I think I ſhall not be altogether wrong, if I do diſobey them in this point, for my worldly happineſs does depend on it, and I fear it will go far in breaking my peace with heaven. For, dear ma'am, we ſhould, in all our ſchemes of worldly happineſs, make ſome proviſion for the better part; and not let the world infringe on the affairs of the ſoul and eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But in my mind, to be joined to ſuch an aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned man, is, in effect, to bid farewel to all ſerious thoughts, and is forſaking religion entirely. But do, dear Miſs Sophia, ſend me your thoughts on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and if I am wrong, don't ſpare me; but give me your mind upon the matter plainly; for I am a young defenceleſs creature, and I ſeem to have no mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to aſk advice of but you at preſent. So I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude by ſending you my beſt wiſhes.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Dear Miſs Polly,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I RECEIVED your two laſt letters which gave me much pain for you. And I do lament your caſe, and heartily ſympathize with you in your misfortunes. Your troubles ſeem to come faſt upon you, and from a quarter that I little expected. For your father and mother uſed to ſhow you all that tenderneſs, which is the effect of real paternal affection. Nay, I often thought, that they were partial in your favor; and it ſeemed as if you could not do a wrong thing, in their view. Your mother, eſpecially, was, I thought, a kind and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:033734_0018_0FF8F0B5F7EE1998"/>
tender hearted woman; and ſeemed to have a feeling for any who were in diſtreſs. But your father, I always thought was a great lover of the world. Indeed, wealth ſeemed to engroſs his whole attention; and he could eaſily forego any thing for riches. But I did not think he was capable of ſuch conduct to his Polly. Indeed I could not have thought it of him. What! reject Mr. Danford, who is in poſſeſſion of a good eſtate; is quite a polite gentleman, endowed with every ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment to be found either in the intrepid or gentle? And then to encourage Mr. Stapleton to viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it you, wholly upon the ſcore of riches, is to me quite unaccountable. And to join his authority with his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal, and try to compel you to break with the one, and to marry the other, is too flagrant to be juſtified, even in one's father.</p>
            <p>Do you, my dear Miſs Polly, aſk my opinion upon the above affair? Perhaps, I am not ſo tender hearted, as my Polly is; but I know what I ſhould do, was I in your circumſtances. Why, I ſhould write to Mr. Danford, to meet me at ſome place, and then go off with him, and get married. And to uſe Mr. Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's words, who could call you to an account about the matter? For you know that your uncle left you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of an eſtate, which is wholly at your diſpoſal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and which you may join with Mr. Danford's, and then you will be nearly as wealthy as your father.</p>
            <p>But I don't ſuppoſe that you will follow this advice. Well, this is what I would do. But then, you ſaid I muſt tell you how you ought to behave; and that, you know is another matter. Well, I think that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents ought not to do any more than adviſe their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and that I think, they are in duty bound to do. But I do not think they ought to compel them to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry againſt their wills; for in ſuch a caſe, many times, the conſequence is fatal. On the other hand, a parent's advice ought to be well weighed; and if it is reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it ought be followed, by all means. But then there is ſuch a thing as parents giving unreaſonable advice; and then I do not think we ought to obey them. For ſuppoſe your parents ſhould command you to murder a certain perſon, do you think that you ought
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033734_0019_0FF8F0BFA884E108"/>
to obey them? No, by no means. Now in your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair—you having ſolemnly promiſed marriage to Mr. Danford; your worldly happineſs, in a great meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure depending upon your fulfilling that promiſe: and their not adviſing you to the contrary before you made that promiſe, when they might well expect that this would be the conſequence of his viſits; in my mind, fully authorizes you to diſobey them in this point, and they have no right to command your obedience in this affair; or to make you revoke your promiſe</p>
            <p>But I muſt ſtill adviſe you, to uſe all the patience that you are capable of; for gentle methods are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the beſt. And do try to gain your mother over upon your ſide; for that will be as likely a means to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate you out of your preſent trouble, as any that I can think of. But I would never give up the main point; nor break with Mr. Danford on any account whatſoever. And ſo you have my thoughts on the matter, without any reſerve. Pray excuſe what is not agreeable to your mind; and at the ſame time aſſure yourſelf, that I am your compaſſionate friend and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</p>

            <p>My mother being in her chamber, I happened to ſtep in at her door; ſhe ſaid to me, Polly, come ſit down by me, child; for I want to have ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with you. This put me into a flutter, as any thing ſhe ſays to me on that ſubject always does; for I was ſenſible of what ſhe wanted to talk upon. Well, I went in, and ſat down by her, and ſaid, what would you ſay to me, ma'am?</p>
            <p>Why, Polly, ſaid ſhe, you quite vexed your father by your behaviour to Mr. Stapleton. He ſays you did not treat him with common civility. You might have uſed him with politeneſs, though you did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to encourage him any further. You know, Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is the duty of a child to obey their parents; and your father commanded you to receive him kindly; therefore I think you are guilty of diſobedience.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, ma'am, ſaid I, you are miſinformed, as to my behaviour to Mr. Stapleton: for in the firſt place, I aſſure you, I treated him with all the politeneſs I was capable of, and told him of my ſituation and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, but he uſed me with unpolite language; and then I was obliged to be plain with him. And now, ma'am, as to obeying parents, I hold myſelf bound to obey my parents in all things wherein their commands are not repugnant to the commands of my Supreme Judge, as ſet forth to us in the word of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring truth: where we are informed, that we ought not to be unequally yoked; which, I ſuppoſe, implies this—<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> who is of a religious <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of mind, ought not <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be married to one that is altogether vain and abandoned —where there can be no hopes of amendment. For if a child ſhould obey her parents
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:033734_0021_0FF8F0C76E6D1220"/>
in this thing, ſhe muſt make herſelf miſerable for life; and, perhaps endanger her everlaſting happineſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. For if a parent has a right to command a child in ſuch a matter, ſurely a huſband has a greater right to command his wife. And, if a child muſt obey her parents in this thing, then ſhe muſt be married to an abandoned man, if it is her parents' pleaſure. And what if that abandoned huſband ſhould command the wife to follow him in all manner of wickedneſs? — Why, by the ſame rule, ſhe muſt obey him, and ſo muſt ſin unavoidably, beſides breaking the above ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme command: and therefore I think a child is not bound to obey her parents, when they command her to be joined to ſuch a man. And now, dear ma'am, let me tell you, word for word, what paſſed between Mr. Stapleton and myſelf, that you may judge whether he or I was moſt unpolite.</p>
            <p>And then I related to her the whole diſcourſe, that paſt between myſelf and Mr. Stapleton, nearly as I ſent it to you; and when I had ended, I made ſome remarks on his diſcourſe with me.</p>
            <p>For him, ſaid I, to ſay, that, if I really loved and eſteemed Mr. Danford, it was a token that I would love and reſpect him, would incline one to think, that he never knew what either love or friendſhip meant. But then his making ſo light of ſolemn promiſes, put me out of all patience with him. A wretch! to ſay that he had made a dozen of them already! Why do you think, Madam, that I could have any patience with him? Indeed I could not. And now, do you wiſh your Polly to have ſuch a huſband as this is, on whoſe word there is no dependence; and who might divide his affection between her and another woman? If it might be ſaid that he hath any affection. And would it not be a dreadful thing for one to have a companion, in whom they could have no confidence nor ſecurity: one who knows not what religion is, and hath no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to right or wrong?</p>
            <p>But Polly, ſaid ſhe, perhaps you are prejudiced againſt him, and prepoſſeſſed in another's favour, which might cauſe you to conſtrue all that he ſaid to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033734_0022_0FF8F0CA49F61838"/>
and, perhaps, if you were to hear him again, he might appear to you in another point of view. And don't you wiſh, Polly, to have another converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him?</p>
            <p>By no means, Madam, ſaid I, if I can avoid it: nor do I deſire ever to ſee him again. And now, dear mamma, if you have any love and affection for your Polly, you will not inſiſt upon our having another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview. And, if you have any regard for me, I pray you will give me your ſentiments on his diſcourſe with me, without the leaſt reſerve; and alſo tell me, whether I may expect a friend in my mamma, or not.</p>
            <p>At this, my mother burſt into tears; and I could not avoid joining with her; and indeed, my eyes would be running over all the time I was talking with her do the beſt I could. Well, after a while my mother ſaid, Polly, you know that my love and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſtrongly biaſſed in your favour; and I muſt acknowledge that I never did like or eſteem Mr. Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton, nor do I like his diſcourſe with you at all: which diſcover neither the gentleman nor the lover.— And I own, he was very unpolite to you, nor can I blame you much for your plainneſs of ſpeech to him.</p>
            <p>But then, what ſhall we do with your father? For he is obſtinately bent upon your having Mr. Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; I having diſcourſed with him on the ſubject, find he is not to be turned. And, he being of ſuch a paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate temper, I dare not ſpeak to him any more on the ſubject. Therefore, you muſt not let him know that I have let you into theſe thoughts of mine; but my heart yearned upon you ſo, that I could not keep my mind from you any longer. And now I will aſſiſt you all I can; but I can have but little hopes of helping you much. Yet this will be ſome conſolation to you, that I don't hate you as you thought I did.</p>
            <p>My dear Miſs Sophia, after this tender declaration from her, do you think I could keep my ſeat? No; for running to her, and dropping on my knees before her, and with my arms claſped around her, I exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, what did you ſay to your Polly? And do you love me yet? When I thought I had no friend in this houſe, to find that my dear mamma is yet my friend, fills
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033734_0023_0FF8F0CE4DFAA4D0"/>
me with ſuch joy, as is almoſt inſupportable! And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I cried, till I ſobbed again; my mother joining with me. But my father coming home, I withdrew to my chamber, and could do no leſs than write you the whole affair. My father does not ſo much as give me a pleaſant look; and is always throwing out ſome word or other, to let me know what to depend upon, if I don't favour Mr. Stapleton; to which I never make any anſwer. But I underſtand he intends to have another diſcourſe with me upon the above affair. And, O how I dread the interview! for I ſhall do nothing but cry, I'll warrant: but that muſt be the ſubject of another letter; therefore I'll conclude this, having an opportunity to ſend it.

            <p>I WILL now continue my ſtory; for my father and I have had a diſcourſe together, on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Mr. Stapleton, which was pretty much as follows: Being in my chamber, my father ſent for me to attend him in his cloſet; my maid attending me, I went trembling to him, and when entered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſat down in the firſt chair I came to, and thought I ſhould have fainted, do the beſt I could. My father, ſpeaking to my maid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaid, Ann, you may withdraw, for I wiſh to talk with your miſtreſs in private.</p>
            <p>After Ann was gone, my father began, by ſaying, Polly, what can be the reaſon, that you did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:033734_0024_0FF8F0D307591E68"/>
Mr. Stapleton, when I engaged him to viſit you purely on that account? You knew it was my pleaſure that you ſhould uſe him kindly. And now give me the reaſons why you behaved ſo unpolitely to him, when he viſited you.</p>
            <p>Dear Sir, ſaid I, I cannot diſcourſe with you on the ſubject. Indeed I cannot! And fell a crying.</p>
            <p>But, Polly, ſaid my father, I will be anſwered to theſe queſtions without the leaſt evaſion!</p>
            <p>Dear Sir, ſaid I, I did not uſe him unpolitely. But as for encouraging him in the ideas of marriage with me, it is wholly inadmiſſible; as I have not the leaſt poſſible regard for him: and beg you, Sir, to excuſe me from ever diſcourſing with him again on that ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; for I cannot think of him for a companion—in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I cannot!</p>
            <p>Why, Polly! ſaid my father, you would think well enough of Mr. Stapleton, were it not for Mr. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. But I am determined that you never ſhall ſee him again; and ſo you may content yourſelf; for that affair is at an end.</p>
            <p>Well, Sir, ſaid I, if I am never to ſee Mr. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford again, I am fully determined never to alter my condition. For, excuſe me, Sir, it is impoſſible for me to think of another man, whilſt Mr. Danford is living; as I have pledged myſelf to him.</p>
            <p>I don't care, ſays my father, any thing about your pledging yourſelf to Mr. Danford; for you ſhall not be married to him! And now, tell me, poſitively, whether you will encourage Mr. Stapleton or not?</p>
            <p>Sir, ſaid I, it is not fitting that I ſhould tell my papa that I will not; therefore deſire to be excuſed from ſaying any thing on the ſubject.</p>
            <p>But, ſaid he, you ſhall give me a direct anſwer to the queſtion, without any equivocation.</p>
            <p>Then, ſaid I, I muſt ſay, I cannot encourage him; and hope you will excuſe me, Sir, if I tell you that I think my life depends upon it; and hope you will not inſiſt upon my ever ſeeing him again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, I am ſure if you love your Polly, you will not invite Mr. Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton here on that account.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:033734_0025_0FF8F0DB4E75D3F8"/>Polly, ſaid he, if you are ſo incorrigible, I ſhall not give myſelf any trouble about you; and ſo, you muſt not expect any protection from me in any matter what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; for I ſhall wholly give you up for loſt: and if you loſe my friendſhip, I don't know what will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of you.</p>
            <p>Dear papa, ſaid I, will you conſent for me to go to my uncle's at Philadelphia, and pay my aunt a viſit; ſhe being very earneſt to have me viſit her this ſeaſon, and ſpend the winter with her? If you will give your approbation, Sir, I will immediately ſet about getting ready to go, as I can have an opportunity to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed there ſoon. Dear Sir, won't you conſent to my going?</p>
            <p>Polly, ſaid my father, you ſhall not go: and from this time you ſhall not go out of my houſe; which, with the garden, ſhall be your limits, until you ſubmit to my propoſals. I have no more to ſay to you at preſent, ſo you may withdraw.</p>
            <p>Well, our I went, to my chamber, and cried a good while; for the tears would run down my cheeks all the time my father was talking with me. So you ſee I am completely confined. Yet under all theſe afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I have ſome conſolation. My Miſs Sophia is my friend. Mr. Danford doth not deſpiſe me; and my mother loves me ſtill. Beſides, I think I have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience that doth not accuſe me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but, above all, my greateſt dependence is in him who is able to deliver out of all adverſity; religion being my chief ſupport.

               <salute>My Dear Miſs Polly,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I CAN take no reſt or comfort becauſe of your confinement. Muſt I be the cauſe of ſo much trouble and affliction, to the perſon in whom my worldy happineſs is wholly centered? But, my dear, if it was in my power to extricate you out of theſe difficulties, I ſhould not heſitate one moment: but I don't ſee that any thing can be done at preſent, in an honorable way, to deliver you out of your trouble. I find I am whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excluded from ſeeing you: for, applying to Mr. Granville for leave to diſcourſe with you for the ſpace of ten minutes only, I was denied with contempt. I even expoſtulated with him, to ſuffer me to take my leave of you, if no more, but could not prevail. I then told him how deeply I was intereſted in your welfare; which only put him into a paſſion; and I was forced to drop the ſubject: But it touched me to the quick, to think that I muſt not ſo much as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with him upon the matter. For he forbid me ever ſaying any thing about you again. But I don't love you the leſs for his behaviour to me, no, my dear. You may reſt aſſured, that I am wholly your's, and that my affections are unalterably fixed, and are uncapable of roving. But I am going to propoſe a thing to you, which is this. The ſhip Goodſpeed now lies at the wharf, ready loaded for the Eaſt, and perhaps will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed as far as Canton, in China: which will be a voyage of a year and a half or two years; and as I own one half of her, the reſt of the owners have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to me to go in her, in the capacity of a ſuper-cargo. I having ſome inclination to viſit thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; and my affairs being now in a proſperous ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:033734_0027_0FF8F0EA541B1458"/>
I think it may be productive of good to us, for me to undertake the voyage. If Providence ſhould ſtill ſmile upon me, perhaps, in the courſe of a year or two, I may appear in a leſs exceptionable point of view to your father than I do at preſent I think, at leaſt, my going abroad, muſt effect your liberation. I cannot think of your being confined wholly on my account; and I diſdain to uſe any kind of artifice, to get you into my hands, until every other method is tried: for we ought not to uſe fraud in any caſe whatſoever, but truſt all our affairs in the hands of a kind Providence; and, be aſſured, my dear, if we do, we ſhall not be diſappointed. And I verily believe, that we ſhall be extricated out of theſe troubles and difficulties, and be happier in each other than if thoſe difficulties had never befallen us. Some things that have come under my obſervation of late, fully evinces the above obſervation.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not, however, engage in this undertaking without your approbation; and ſhall therefore wait your anſwer to this before I proceed any farther. For it ſhall be wholly in your power to command me, either to go or ſtay, as you ſhall think moſt conducive to your happineſs. At the ſame time, you may reſt aſſured, that I am wholly your's; and ſhall remain ſo, either at home or abroad.</p>
            <p>And now, my deareſt Miſs Polly, let us put our whole truſt in that Providence which is able to keep us in all theſe changes and viciſſitudes of life, and bring good out of evil—which I pray may be the happy caſe with you and me. And I cannot but make ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on being happy in you, after theſe ſtorms are overblown.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I RECEIVED your letter with as true af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, perhaps, as you wrote it; but language will fail me to deſcribe the gratitude of my heart, for your regard and tenderneſs to me, after your having expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced ſuch inſulting behaviour and outrageous lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage from my father. But there is no compariſon between virtue and vice: for virtue will ever ſet a man above reſentment at the little foibles of thoſe that have no regard to virtue; cauſing him to act conſiſtent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in every occurrence of life; not even aiming to take the advantage of the low minded; but paſſing on in qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, through the boiſterous tumults of a noiſy world, with a mind fully fixed, and firmly reſted, on a kind Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; he is willing to wait the determination of that Providence; and not to ruſh into fraudulent meaſures to extricate himſelf out of difficulty. This is the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic of my dear Mr. Danford, when, at the ſame time, thoſe, that are not poſſeſſed of your noble mind, would try to retaliate and uſe every kind of fraud, to be revenged on ſuch as they think are their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; by which means they often involve themſelves in inextricable difficulties, which often end in their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruin.</p>
            <p>But to return: I think you have pitched upon a noble mode of conduct, which cannot fail of ſalutary effects. It will, doubtleſs, be productive of my enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And, in the time of your abſence, ſomething, I doubt not, will turn up to our advantage in an honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way, which will be vaſtly preferable to the ſame end gained in a clandeſtine manner. For, to uſe your language, I don't think fraud ought to be uſed in any
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:033734_0029_0FF8F0F2779A44A8"/>
caſe whatſoever. If we truſt to Providence, I don't think we ſhall be diſappointed.</p>
            <p>I fully acquieſce in your propoſal of viſiting the eaſtern part of the world. And may your life and health be preſerved, and the beſt of heaven's bleſſings attend you, until you return, richly experiencing the kind hand of Providence. In the mean time, I expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience great trials, and afflictions on your account: for my father, uſing me with great ſeverity, has confined me to the houſe; except that I have the privilege of the garden, with my maid to attend me as uſual. But his ſeverity has only this effect, to increaſe my affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to you: cauſing me to ſee the vaſt diſparity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a virtuous character, and a man whoſe aims are wholly confined to this world. But I muſt tell you that I have gained my mother over on my ſide, who no doubt will try all in her power to help me.</p>
            <p>I ſtill expect to ſuffer great trials; but am determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to adhere firmly to the promiſe I made you. And you may reſt aſſured, that I will prove conſtant to you even to a punctilio. Neither ſhall any trouble that I may meet with leſſen my attachment to you. I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted of my father to allow me to go to my uncle's at Philadelphia, and was denied. But I ſhall renew my requeſt when you are gone, and perhaps by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of my mother, I may gain his conſent. But I hope I ſhall conduct myſelf in all theſe affairs, ſo as that I may be blameleſs, and have a conſcience void of offence; ever truſting and looking to him for aid, who is able to reſcue in the greateſt diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>And ſo I conclude with my warmeſt and moſt unfeigned wiſhes, and prayers, that you may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in ſafety to your friend and humble ſervant,</p>

               <salute>Dear Miſs Sophia,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT has been ſome time ſince I wrote to you; and longer ſince I received a line from you. I have a great many things to tell you; for you ſay you wiſh to be informed of all the occurrences relative to Mr. Danford. Accordingly, I ſhall proceed without any apology. And, in the firſt place, I will inform you that Mr. Danford ſent me a letter, informing me of his deſign of going in the ſhip Goodſpeed, to the Eaſt Indies, if agreeable to me. To which I returned an anſwer, that I had no objection. And now he is gone, having ſailed about a fortnight ago; ſince which, I have had the old ſtory over again; my father having had another diſcourſe with me, in which he told me, that Mr. Danford was now gone to a far diſtant country, (which plainly ſhewed, as was always his opinion, that he did not ſet much by me, notwithſtanding all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of eſteem;) as he is now gone, ſaid he, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is at an end. For now he hath plainly ſhowed what he was after, that he wanted the lamb for the ſake of her fleece. For, when he ſaw that he was not likely to have any of my eſtate, his love ſoon came to nothing; and now he has run away. Well, Polly, I can ſoon make up your loſs, for I have invited Mr. Stapleton to pay you another viſit, and I hope now he will have better ſucceſs, ſince your idol hath forſaken you. And I hope you will receive him in a more polite manner than you did when he was here before; at leaſt, I hope you will receive him with common civility. And what ſay you, Polly, to another viſit from Mr. Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton?</p>
            <p>Dear Sir, ſaid I, if I tell you, that I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his viſits, you will be angry with me. But if I
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:033734_0031_0FF8F0F997B1FAA0"/>
muſt anſwer you directly to your queſtion, I muſt ſay, that I don't deſire to ſee him on any ſuch account. And if he gives himſelf the trouble of calling upon me, I cannot diſcourſe with him upon the ſubject you mentioned. Therefore I beg to be excuſed from ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him at all, for it is impoſſible for me to think of placing him in any other relation to me, than he now ſtands in.</p>
            <p>Polly, ſaid my father, you are of an incorrigible temper, and take more delight in diſpleaſing me than any thing you do. If Mr. Stapleton was ever ſo agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to you, yet, I believe you would reject him mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſpleaſe me.</p>
            <p>Sir, ſaid I, I ſhould be happy in pleaſing my papa, if it was in my power. But as for encouraging Mr. Stapleton, I cannot: for my worldly happineſs doth wholly depend upon my not being connected with him. And do you, Sir, wiſh to make me wretched for life? I cannot think you do—but, dear Sir, let me be excuſed from ſeeing Mr. Stapleton, dear Sir, do!</p>
            <p>At this, my father broke out into a violent rage, and ſaid, that if I did not receive him kindly, he would turn me out of his houſe and diſinherit me; and nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er regard me again, any more than he would a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. He then charged me to mind how I behaved myſelf, for he would not, he ſaid, bear ſuch treatment from me in future.—And ſo he diſmiſſed me.</p>
            <p>I went to my chamber, and ſpent the remainder of the day and evening in lamenting my great afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then wrote thus far, and ſhall ſtill continue, writing, until I have an opportunity to ſend you what I have written.</p>
            <p>My dear Miſs Sophia, I will now proceed with my narrative, and relate our further proceedings; for I have had another diſcourſe with my mother, and thus it began. As my mother and I were ſitting togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, ſhe bid the maid go down and ſtay till ſhe ſhould ring for her. She then ſaid to me, Polly, your fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is much ſet upon your receiving another viſit from Mr. Stapleton; and perhaps, as Mr. Danford has now
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:033734_0032_0FF8F0FBF3177F90"/>
left the country, you will think more favourable of Mr. Stapleton than you did before. It being uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that Mr. Danford will ever come near you again. For it appears to me that he would never have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken ſuch a voyage, had he ſet as high a value upon you as he pretended: for he might well think you would be married to ſome other man in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. And indeed I cannot find that he ever ſaid a word to you about his going ſo long a voyage: nor that he has ever ſent you a letter ſince your father for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid him our houſe. If that is the caſe, it is very prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able he has done thinking of you in any other view, than that of a common acquaintance.</p>
            <p>Dear ma'am, ſaid I, I cannot think of Mr. Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; and I wiſh I might not be under the neceſſity of ſeeing him again. But I don't ſee how I can avoid it: and yet you told me that you would ſtand my friend; and do, dear mamma, ſtand by me—for I cannot think of having any body but Mr. Danford.</p>
            <p>Well, Polly, ſaid ſhe, has Mr. Danford ſent you any letters of late? Upon my acknowledging that he had, ſhe deſired me to let her ſee them; and upon her promiſing the utmoſt ſecreſy, I conſented; and immediately fetched her two letters that I received from Mr Danford, and copies of the two letters that I ſent him, and gave them into her hand. She read them, and gave them to me again — ſaying, well, Polly, I ſee now, that the matter is ſettled between Mr. Danford and you: and it will be in vain for Mr. Stapleton to renew his viſits to you. But I think it will be beſt for you to uſe him with politeneſs, on your father's account; for I dread the conſequence if you ſhould not—as your father's heart ſeems to be bound up in Mr. Stapleton; and if you finally reject him, I fear he will turn you off entirely, and wholly diſinherit you.</p>
            <p>Dear Madam, ſaid I, as for his diſinheriting me, it does not trouble me much—for great riches have not the charms with me that they have with ſome.— My heart is not wholly ſet on the things of this world. As to an eſtate, you know, ma'am, that Mr. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:033734_0033_0FF8BF84C7413550"/>
is in poſſeſſion of a good eſtate, and the intereſt that my uncle left me, is ſomething conſiderable— which, placed together, will make a fortune, fully an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering the utmoſt of my wiſhes. But then I dread my father's diſpleaſure; and I would do any thing to gain his bleſſing, conſiſtent with my former ſolemn promiſes: for a parent's bleſſing is an eſſential thing with me—I prize that above all my father's eſtate. You don't know, Madam, how many tears it has coſt me already; for I do nothing but cry night and day.— But it gives me great conſolation, to think you are my friend, becauſe, now I can unboſom my mind to you, which is a great relief to me.</p>
            <p>As for my being favourable to Mr. Stapleton, I cannot in any ſenſe of the word: for if I ſhould, and then reject him, it would only exaſperate my father the more. And ſo I think it will be beſt to uſe him plainly: for if there muſt be a ſtorm with my father, it may as well be now, as ſix months hence. But if matters ſhould be deſperate with my father, do be ſo kind, as to intercede with him to let me go and pay my uncle Finter, of Philadelphia, a viſit: my aunt Finter having ſent me a letter, deſiring me to wait on her this ſeaſon and ſpend the winter there. Now, Madam, if you could prevail with my father, to give his conſent for me to go; and if I ſhould ſtay there ſome time, perhaps, ſomething might turn up that would reconcile my father to me. At leaſt it would have this effect, that I ſhould be out of the way of Mr. Stapleton; and then he would ſoon addreſs ſome other perſon; for one is as good as another, with him. As he is void of any kind of love, or tender feelings, perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al qualifications are not an object with him. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, he would be glad of money; for his mind is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet on the world. If he ſhould marry ſome other perſon, it would relieve me of that trouble; and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſomething would turn up, that I might gain my father's affections, and bleſſing; which would be a happy event to me. And now, Madam, mayn't I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on your aid in this matter? May I not?</p>
            <p>Polly, ſaid ſhe, I will think on this matter, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:033734_0034_0FF8F10361BD5440"/>
I may aſſiſt you; for I think it beſt for you to go to your uncle's, and ſpend the winter there. And after this viſit of Mr. Stapleton is over, I will impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune your father on your behalf. But you muſt keep theſe things to yourſelf, on my account. For ſhould your father know of this diſcourſe, he would be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at me, as well as at you.</p>
            <p>Upon this, I went out; and now you ſee that I muſt have another interview with Mr. Stapleton. And O, how I dread that interview! But I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to uſe him very plainly. Don't you think 'twill be the beſt way? Well, that muſt be the ſubject of another letter; in the mean time, aſſure yourſelf that I am, &amp;c.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Dear Miſs Sophia,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I WILL now continue my narrative, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much regard to method, as I am writing to my Miſs Sophia, who will make proper allowances.</p>
            <p>Well, Mr. Stapleton has paid me another viſit; and the creature came in full aſſurance of ſucceſs; being filled with a ſenſe of his own importance. Indeed, he is, naturally, very ſelf-ſufficient. Well, I thought I would uſe him with a little pleaſantry, to ſee if I could not ſhame him; and, at the ſame time, divert my ſelf. My father having introduced him to me, in form, immediately withdrew. And he, ſeating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by me, ſaid, well, Miſs Polly, I am come to pay you another viſit; and I hope it will be more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to you now, than when I called upon you the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er day. What ſay you?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:033734_0035_0FF8F105AF0D8C28"/>Perhaps, Mr. Stapleton, ſaid I, you and I may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come acquainted yet, in ſpite of my beſt endeavours to the contrary. For you are ſo good, Sir, as to pay your reſpects officiouſly. But I wiſh to know on what errand you have come; and then I ſhall know how to diſcourſe with you.</p>
            <p>I have come, ſaid he, upon the old ſcore of court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and hope now, you will not ſay to me, nay: ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. Danford is gone; that being your chief ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection before. And I expected to have been received now with open arms; and that you would have been more earneſtly engaged in the buſineſs, than I ſhould myſelf.</p>
            <p>It is a wonder, Sir, ſaid I, that I have not been to your houſe, before now, on this ſame buſineſs; but I beg you to excuſe me, Sir, becauſe it is not agreeable to the rules of decorum, for a maiden to addreſs a man on that ſubject. But I muſt tell you, Sir, that I ſhould think much better of you, if you could diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween real affection, and real hatred. But I find you are void of quick diſcernment, or elſe you are wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blinded, and won't diſcern.</p>
            <p>Be that as it may, ſaid he, I will not give up my pretenſions to you; as your father promiſes to aid me all in his power. Nay, I will even worry you with my viſits, and perhaps, by and bye, you will think more favorably of me. And ſo I do not deſpair of ſucceſs yet.</p>
            <p>Well Sir, ſaid I, I am already greatly <hi>worried</hi> with your viſits; and yet you may well deſpair of ſucceſs: for I declare poſitively, that you ſhall never ſucceed with me. And if you had the leaſt diſcernment, you would not have given yourſelf the trouble to call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, at this time. And, indeed, had you the leaſt ſenſe of honor, you would, now, quit all your pretenſions; and try to gain me my father's affection, that you have been the means of alienating from me. Had you a generous heart, you would try to extricate me out of the difficulty you have brought me into. But I can't depend upon your generoſity: fearing that you are wholly deſtitute of that nobleneſs of mind. But you being an egotiſt, and ſelf-admirer, are led to think it
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:033734_0036_0FF8F108841C2F60"/>
impoſſible but that every one muſt like you: And it is of no avail to uſe reaſon with you; becauſe you are not poſſeſſed, in any conſiderable degree of that noble qualification, which raiſeth the humane above the bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal creation. Perhaps, Sir, I ſhall raiſe your choler; and I don't care if I do: becauſe you deſerve to be dealt plainly with, at leaſt, from me. For you have been the cauſe of great trouble and affliction to me. And now, Sir, why won't you be ſo kind, as to quit all thoughts of me, and let me try to extricate myſelf out of thoſe entanglements, as well as I can? For 'twill be fruitleſs, to ſay any thing more to me on that ſubject; as I am fully determined in my own mind; and unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſet againſt any alliance with you, of ſuch a nature. And, dear Sir, if you will give me no more trouble on this ſcore, I ſhall ever eſteem you as my father's friend, and my benefactor.</p>
            <p>But, ſaid he, perhaps I ſhall get your father's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, if I don't perſiſt. Indeed, I am almoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged: and if it was not for your father, I would relinquiſh all pretenſions to you; but I don't know how he will like it, if I ſhould. Dear Sir, ſaid I, my father will not reſent the matter with you; but I ſhall feel the weight of his reſentment. Then, Sir, you will leave me, won't you? What ſay you to this?</p>
            <p>I will not, ſaid he, inſiſt any more upon it at preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent; and ſo I hope you will think as favourable of me as you can. So taking his leave of me, he went out, and told my father, that he found me wholly averſe to any alliance with him; and thought it beſt to drop the matter; thanked my father for his favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able opinion of him, took his leave of him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew.</p>
            <p>I have not ſeen my father ſince, but I fear his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure greatly. Dear Miſs Sophia, theſe are trying ſcenes; for 'tis hard to diſobey parents; but in this thing, I cannot obey my father. Yet I would not wilfully do a wrong thing for the world! And, O that I may ſo behave myſelf, as that I may, in ſome meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, be blameleſs! But, Miſs Sophia, one word to you. I have heard that Mr. Granbe has paid his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:033734_0037_0FF8BF8C7A11A578"/>
to you. How is it? Is the account that I had of it true? You muſt tell me, without any reſerve. Well, he is a gentleman, in the true ſenſe of the word; is endowed with a noble mind, and worthy of any body's eſteem; and I am ſure you will not ſlight him.</p>
            <p>Well now, Miſs Sophia, I ſhall expect a letter from you; for you have a good ſubject now to write upon, and I want ſome of your advice. At the ſame time, you may aſſure yourſelf, that</p>

            <head>LETTER XII. From Miſs <hi>SOPHIA DANIELSON,</hi> to Miſs POLLY GRANVILLE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My dear Miſs Polly,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE read your letters with emotion, and I feel for you in every line. Your trials are truly complicated; having an angry father at home, who ought to give you protection, and endeavour to ſecure your morals: but who, on the contrary, is turned againſt you, and is trying to deſtroy them. And abroad, the man in whom you placed your whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, is abandoning his country on your account.</p>
            <p>Well, now let us look on the bright ſide. I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding glad that you have gained your mother over; and as you are rid of Mr. Stapleton, it is not likely you will meet with any more trouble from that quarter; upon which event I do heartily congratulate you.</p>
            <p>Your propoſition of going to your uncle's at Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, I think, is a good thought of your's; for if you can once get there, perhaps you can eaſily gain liberty to continue there till Mr. Danford returns; and I doubt not, but, by the help of your mother, you
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:033734_0038_0FF8F10AB7B20A98"/>
will gain your father's conſent to your going. I know you ever had a deſire to viſit your aunt, and this will be a lucky opportunity, as you will ſpring two mines at once; you will get clear of theſe domeſtic diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, and pay your aunt, and couſins, a viſit at the ſame time.</p>
            <p>Well, as to what you wrote about my own affairs, do you think I will acquaint you with my love affairs; and let you into thoſe tranſactions, which delicacy and prudence, in our ſex, require us to conceal? Yes, to my Miſs Polly, I will write, without any kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
            <p>Well, the affair was introduced in the following manner. One day, as I ſat in the ſummer-houſe, at the end of our garden, I ſaw my father enter the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, with Mr. Granbe. They walked the garden, and ſeemed to be engaged in diſcourſe. After taking ſeveral winding-walks, but ſtill bending their courſe towards the ſummer-houſe, at length they came to the door. I aroſe, paid my reſpects, and was going to withdraw; but my father ſaid to me, Sophia, this gentlemen wiſhes to have ſome diſcourſe with you for a few minutes; and then he immediately with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew. We ſeated ourſelves in the ſummer-houſe, and diſcourſed together for ſome time; ſince which he has renewed his viſits often. He is a gentleman of a noble mind and generous heart; is very polite, and ſeems to have a tender regard for me: he is of a ſerious turn of mind; and, I think, one may fully truſt to his honour. But the moſt fortunate circumſtance is, that he is a favourite of my father's. Now, what objection can I have to ſuch a man? Or what objections have you to ſuch an alliance for your Sophia? Will you ſend me your thoughts on the ſubject, and at the ſame time continue your narrative? For I muſt know all your proceedings; and ſo you muſt write without any reſerve. And at the ſame time, you may look upon me as your moſt faithful friend and ſervant,</p>

            </opener>
            <p>AS it has been ſome time ſince I wrote to you, I have ſeveral things to inform you of: for I have met with more hard things, and experienced more of my father's diſpleaſure. But now I am all joyous; and ſo you ſee I go from one extreme to the other. But to continue my narrative.—My father and I have had another ecclairciſſement: for he called upon me to explain to him, the reaſons of my conduct of late, and ſaid he would have an anſwer to his queſtion, without the leaſt evaſion.</p>
            <p>Sir, ſaid I, what part of my conduct would you wiſh me to explain to you?</p>
            <p>I will have you explain to me, ſaid he, the reaſons why you diſobeyed me, in not encouraging Mr. Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton.</p>
            <p>There are many reaſons, Sir, ſaid I, which I can give, why I could not encourage him. In the firſt place, he is a man that I could never love or eſteem; and then his morals are altogether naughty: for he cares not for right or wrong. He is not poſſeſſed of that turn of mind that would be in any degree agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to me—for he ſeems to me to be formed for a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. Why, he once told me, that he ſhould firſt take care to gain my obedience, and then look out for my love and eſteem. Now, Sir, that plainly ſhows that he means to make a ſlave of his wife. And would you wiſh, Sir, that your daughter ſhould live in a ſtate of vaſſalage all her days, and be in a worſe condition than the meaneſt of your dependants? And, indeed Sir, I ſhould rather be a ſervant in ſome families, than to be his wife. And I hope, Sir, you will forgive my ſeeming diſobedience, now you have heard my inducements to reject him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:033734_0040_0FF8F10F767D10F0"/>But he is very rich, ſaid my father, and you know money anſwers all things; and why need you care about his morals, as long as he has money enough? His morals won't effect you—you may look to your own rectitude, and let his alone. A large eſtate is all that you ought to look after, when going to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</p>
            <p>Dear Sir, ſaid I, I muſt differ from you in ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment relative to the choice of a companion. Are not virtue and nobleneſs of mind, vaſtly preferable to rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and grandeur? For riches may be ſuddenly taken from a man, and then if he has nothing elſe to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him, he will be in a poor condition indeed. A perſon of no morals is not to be truſted, but a virtuous perſon will be truſted and reſpected in whatever ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life he may be in. As to a man's bad morals not effecting his wife, I cannot join with you, Sir: for a man's word is his wife's ſecurity: but where one cannot truſt to her huſband's honour, how can ſhe feel herſelf ſafe? And then, ſuch an one will bring diſgrace upon himſelf; and how can the man be diſgraced without his companion participating in it? For that connection, let me remind you, dear Sir, is, or ought to be, very near.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, a virtuous man is ever the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and glory of his wife. Such a man will ever come into one's preſence with that ſerenity and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in his countenance, which is a true emblem of greatneſs of mind. And indeed, ſuch men, and ſuch only, are capable of that tenderneſs, love, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſoul, that would ever cauſe me to delight in the other ſex. And now, Sir, I hope I have anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your demand, as to this ſubject.</p>
            <p>Well, Polly, ſaid he, you have diſobliged me to that degree, that for the future, I ſhall not give my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf any trouble about you; and you muſt not expect ever to ſhare in my affections or eſtate, as you would if you had not diſobeyed me.</p>
            <p>Dear papa, ſaid I, if I may expect to have your bleſſing, I will be content, as I ſhall prize that above any thing. And may not I expect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Sir, to have your
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:033734_0041_0FF8BF8E21C7E360"/>
conſent to my ſpending the winter with my aunt Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, at Philadelphia? Do, dear Sir, give me your conſent to go, will you? I had rather you would go than not, ſaid he, and you may ſtay there, until you come home more obedient to your father, than you are at preſent.</p>
            <p>I thank you, Sir, ſaid I, and it ſhall ever be my ſtudy to pleaſe my papa in all things that I poſſibly can: for there is nobody that has a greater affection for a father than I have, or would do more for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent than I would. And ſo I withdrew. But it was a hard taſk to me, to talk ſo much to my father on that ſubject: for I am ever ſtruck with an awe, when I come into his preſence, as he has a very ſtern ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic countenance, and ſeems to look one through. Well, I am now preparing for my viſit, and ſhall ſet out in leſs than a month. I am determined to go in the ſtage-coach, being quite averſe to water carriage. And now you may ſee I am all life, having gained my point farther than I expected. And who knows but I ſhall gain a complete deliverance after a while. It is beſt, I ſee, not to run ourſelves into ruin, but wait upon the movements of Providence, and truſt our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly to a divine care, which I hope to do in ſome meaſure. And I will yet venture myſelf in the hands of that Divine Power, who cannot do amiſs.</p>
            <p>Well, now, as to your affairs with Mr. Granbe. Why, your courtſhip goes on ſwimmingly; and I ſuppoſe you have nearly arrived at the haven of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. Well, look out, if you ſhould arrive there before I do. Do you aſk for my objections to Mr. Granbe? I have no objections; but, on the contrary, I think he is a gentleman, in the genuine ſenſe of the word; and that you cannot do better than to receive his viſits. And beſides, it ſeems your family are all delighted with him. And your father is a man of quick diſcernment, and is a good judge of men, and their pretenſions.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I AM greatly rejoiced to find you have gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your father's conſent to viſit your aunt Finter. I am inclined to think, that your ſufferings on that ſcore are nearly at an end; for certainly, when Mr. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford arrives at Philadelphia, and finds you there, he will, doubtleſs, marry you without waiting for your father's conſent. And I don't ſee where the wrong will be, as he will find you out of your father's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. And as your father has threatened to diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit you, it will make no difference whether you pleaſe him, or not. If I was in your place, I ſhould be glad of ſuch an opportunity to ſteal a march upon them. Indeed, I could not help exulting a little, upon fruſtrating their views, though they were my parents. But I don't know whether it would be right or not. Perhaps you will ſend me your thoughts on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in your next letter: for I expect to receive letters from you, even from Philadelphia. And you muſt write all the occurrences relative to your courtſhip, until you are married. And I ſhall expect one letter from you ſoon after you arrive there.</p>
            <p>Well, as to my own affairs. You ſeem to threaten me if I ſhould get married before you; but you don't ſay what ſhall be the puniſhment. And therefore, 'tis ten to one if I don't; for matters go on in as juſt a train as can be expected. Mr. Granbe continues his viſits, and I expect that we ſhall ſoon ſtand in a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent capacity to each other, than what we do at preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. Well, when this event takes place, I will write and inform you of it. And ſo I conclude, wiſhing you peace and proſperity, and every enjoyment that life can afford.</p>

            <head>LETTER XV. From Miſs <hi>POLLY GRANVILLE,</hi> to Miſs SOPHIA DANIELSON.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My dear Miſs Sophia,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I AM now ſafely arrived at my uncle Finter's houſe in Philadelphia. My uncle Finter is a very noble minded man indeed. He is an ornament to the age he lives in; being, beſides, otherwiſe qualified, quite a religious man. He has a large eſtate, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on an extenſive trade; and, of courſe, has a large family; yet not one of his family is allowed to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the time of prayers, which are conſtantly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by himſelf every night and morning. And all under his care are enjoined to attend conſtantly on public worſhip, on the Lord's day; except they have ſuch an excuſe as they dare appear before their Judge with, at the laſt day. And all are commanded to let their converſation be modeſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to live, as if they expected to give an account of their behaviour and conduct in life. After I have told you this, you may expect that they have a very modeſt, regular family. And, indeed, I never lived in ſuch a delightful family before. For you know that religion always appeared beautiful to me. And how different is this family from many in the world! And even from my father's! For he being a lover of the world, gave himſelf no trouble about religious duties; in which I always thought he was faulty. But it is my earneſt prayer that he may ſee his miſtake, and reform, before it is too late. 'Tis my opinion, that if a man did not think well of relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, yet he would find his account in ſetting up ſuch a regulation in his family; if it were only for the ſake of the government of his houſe. But my uncle is quite a thoughtful man; and takes delight in the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his duty, which ſeems to impreſs one's mind
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:033734_0044_0FF8BF93668F0860"/>
with holy thoughts, that carry one quite out of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and give one the foretaſte of thoſe delights that are reſerved for them, who love virtue, and are willing to ſuffer for religion. My uncle and aunt have been made acquainted with my ſtory; are very kind to me, and try to make me as eaſy as poſſible. And, as I am of a ſober turn of mind, my uncle takes delight in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing with me; and often tells me, that I ſhall not go home again, until Mr. Danford returns He tells me he has ſeen Mr. Danford, and was delighted with him at their firſt acquaintance. If Mr. Danford, ſaid my uncle, was not poſſeſſed of one copper of eſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhould prefer him in every reſpect, to any rich, ſelfiſh clown whatever. But I am informed, ſaid he, that his circumſtances are quite eaſy; and you muſt make yourſelf eaſy with us, Polly, till Mr. Danford returns, who will touch in here, as the ſhip is partly to unload in this port; and we will write to your father, not doubting but his conſent can be obtained to your mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. In the mean time, you muſt make yourſelf as eaſy, and as free, as if you were in your father's houſe. And furthermore, child, ſaid he, I deſire you would look upon me as a father, until your other father is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to you; which event, I have no doubt, will he brought about in a happy manner. In the mean time, I ſhall look upon you as one of my daughters. And you muſt not harbour a thought of being burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to us; for we delight to have you in the family, and ſhall regret your departure, whenever the time comes that we muſt be deprived of you. And ſo you ſee, Miſs Sophia, that I may make myſelf eaſy; and indeed I ſhould, if I had but my father's bleſſing. But what do you think I could ſay to my uncle? Why I could do nothing but cry for joy, I think, which my uncle ſaw with pleaſure: for he is a man of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, and can diſtinguiſh between tears of joy, and thoſe of a troubled heart. But I recovered my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as well as I could, and thanked him for his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to, and tenderneſs of me. But my heart ſeemed as if it would have left its orbit, on ſuch a tender diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe as this was. For having had nothing but rough
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:033734_0045_0FF8F11E59EA4AE8"/>
uſage of late, and now having all theſe tender ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions heaped on me; indeed it was almoſt too much for me. But my uncle and aunt often diſcourſe on theſe ſubjects, and ſometimes on religion; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they try all in their power to make my preſent ſituation agreeable to me.</p>
            <p>I will now give you ſome account of my couſins. My uncle has four children, three daughters and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſon. The oldeſt daughter is about fourteen; nam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sally, after my aunt. She is a ſweet girl, and I take great delight in her company; and indeed we are almoſt always together. And it ſeems to pleaſe my uncle much, that I ſet ſo much by her; for he is very fond of his children; and well enough he may be, they being very promiſing, and modeſt behaved.</p>
            <p>Now, as to my journey, I came in the ſtage, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only by my maid Ann, who has engaged to ſtay with me until I return. She is a ſober, well-behaved girl; is enamoured with the regularity of the family, and wiſhes ſhe could always live in ſuch an one.</p>
            <p>As there was nothing uncommon in our journey, I ſhall paſs it over. But as to what you ſaid, about my marrying without my father's conſent, and ſtealing a march upon them, and then exulting in their mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, I ſhall never agree to it: for I hold myſelf bound to obey my father ſtill, as much as if he had not uſed me with ſuch ſeverity; and I ſhall not be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried without his conſent, if it is poſſible to obtain it. But I can make little dependence on that; although my uncle has promiſed to gain his conſent, if poſſible. When you are married, I hope you will write to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me; and if you write by the poſt, I ſhall ſoon get your letters.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>My Dear Miſs Polly,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOUR letter has been received, and has given me very pleaſing ſenſations; to think you was ſo delightfully received by your uncle and aunt. What a good and amiable man your uncle is! One that is formed to ſoothe the diſtreſſed, eaſe the burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and comfort the troubled. You may well feel yourſelf eaſy in ſuch a houſe as his is; it being every way calculated to allay the troubles of the mind. For where there is ſo much good nature, modeſty, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, and real religion, one cannot help being calm in one's mind. A ſhip's crew, that for many days, has been beaten, and drove about with a violent ſtorm, and all at once, find themſelves in a ſafe and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious harbour, muſt feel a ſatisfaction inexpreſſible: ſo it muſt have been with my dear Miſs Polly, after having eſcaped the rocks and quickſands which you had like to been driven among; to find yourſelf in ſo good a harbour as your uncle's is. And I do greatly rejoice that you have got ſafely at your uncle's houſe.</p>
            <p>But now, as to my own affairs; I have been mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried theſe two months, and have got to houſe-keeping, if you'll believe me. Perhaps you may think that we were in haſte. But Mr. Granbe's circumſtances required it; and what objection could I have to it? Well, you will want to know how my—what ſhall I call him? Why, a huſband—and ſo there you have the word at large. Well, as I was going to ſay, you will want to know how he behaves to me. Why, very politely. But he is not one of thoſe frantic lovers, that heap all upon one at once; and then have no more to ſay about love, or affections all their days after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:033734_0047_0FF8F12307282B28"/>
But he leaves ſomething for improvement; and indeed, he does improve in his attentions to me every day. And then, he is always the moſt complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant to me in company: and never ſays any thing at my expenſe, in company. There are ſome men, that will ſay ſhocking things of their wives, only to raiſe a laugh in company; and don't think of what will be the effect; which will inevitably be this, that other men will take the ſame liberty of ſpeech with them, they do themſelves. But Mr. Granbe is not aſhamed to be polite to, and tender of me, in company: Indeed he is a very regular, ſober man in his houſe; and keeps up thoſe regulations in his family, that you ſpeak ſo highly of in your uncle. And he being a man that has all my affections and eſteem, I feel myſelf entirely eaſy in my ſituation.</p>
            <p>Well now, one word about your father; he has met with ſome capital loſſes ſince you went away, which has conſiderably perplexed his affairs; and I heard, by the bye, that he applied to your broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Murfee for aſſiſtance; and that he refuſed to help him. For Murfee is juſt ſuch another as himſelf. And he might well think he would not help him. He will look well at home, and let others ſhift for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: for he does not care who ſinks, if he can ſwim. But I feel grieved for your mother; for ſhe is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a delightful woman! Indeed ſhe is.</p>

               <salute>Ever Dear Daughter,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS I have not written you a letter ſince you have been at your uncle's, except juſt to inform you of our health, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:033734_0048_0FF8F1292136CAD8"/>I will now inform you of our circumſtances, which are in a diſtreſsful ſituation. For we have loſt a ſhip, and a brig: both richly loaded. The ſhip returning from the Eaſt-Indies, with a very valuable cargo, was caſt away, and all loſt. The brig met with the ſame fate; and the reſt of our ſhipping have made but ſmall returns. In conſequence of theſe loſſes, your father has been obliged to mortgage the largeſt part of his landed intereſt; and in vain has he applied to your brother Murfee for relief; although the eſtate is mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for not more than half of its real value; and though he offered to ſecure the lands to your brother, if he would only take up the mortgage, ſo that the eſtate might not go out of the family; yet he refuſed, and returned him this anſwer, that he would not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve himſelf to help another out of difficulty. And if he had been ſo unwiſe, as to run himſelf into irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trievable ruin, he muſt abide by the conſequence.</p>
            <p>You and your ſiſter Jenny, are all the children we have left; for Murfee has wholly abandoned us: and your father has uſed Mr. Danford and you ſo roughly, that if Mr. Danford was at home, and you were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, we could not expect any relief from you. The thoughts of which, together with our preſent diſtreſs, is almoſt too much for me.</p>
            <p>But this trouble has had ſo good effect on your father, that it has opened his eyes, to ſee the difference between riches and virtue. And he ſays, that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents heartily of his folly, in uſing Mr. Danford and you with ſuch ſeverity; and wiſhes to ſee Mr. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, that he might immediately aſk his forgiveneſs, and make an offer of you to him. He is, alſo, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced to think, that you eſcaped Mr. Stapleton.</p>
            <p>I can now inform you, that Mr. Stapleton is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and to juſt ſuch another as himſelf; and, that they live very unhappily together. Indeed they have had their houſe on fire two or three times, already; and, at ſuch times, ſhe ſeeks refuge at her father's; and then Mr. Stapleton has nothing to do, but to tackle his coach and go after her. And after ſome abatement
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:033734_0049_0FF8BF9573EB1F58"/>
on both ſides, ſhe is willing to go home with him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain: and thus they muſt wear out a miſerable life together; being never likely to enjoy any peace or happineſs in this world. And what a bleſſing it is, my dear, that you ſteered clear of this rock!</p>
            <p>My dear child, you muſt forgive your father; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed you muſt! For he loves you as well as a father ought to love a child: and I really believe, that his ſeverity to you, at that time, was deſigned by him for your good. But your father thinks otherwiſe now; for he ſees there is a great diſparity between virtue and vice; and that virtue, with poverty, is preferable to vice accompanied with riches; and ſo, Polly, you will forgive your father, won't you? And I ſhould be glad if you would ſend us a letter, and tell us whether you can, and will forgive us, or not. And O, that you was here with us. But all in good time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you look for Mr. Danford, by this time; and I would not deprive you of an interview with him, at his arrival, by deſiring you to come home; knowing that his abſence has been very tedious to you; your heart, I know, being always with him. For you two ſeem to be formed for each other: and I hope, ere long, you will ſtand in a nearer relation to one another, than you have heretofore done.</p>
            <p>As to our misfortunes, they are very grievous to the mind; being repugnant to nature, and an idea of grandeur. But, no doubt, they are deſigned for our good, and, perhaps, will terminate for our happineſs in this world, as well as in that which is to come; for it will certainly ſerve to wean us from the world. And I think it has had a good effect on your father already; who has become a great advocate for virtue, and ſpeaks well of religion. And now, my dear daughter, let us live in this world, as if we expected that this was not our abiding place; and let us uſe the things of this world as only lent to us, and be willing to part with them at any time, when the great Beſtower of every bleſſing ſhall think beſt to deprive us of them. For we, and all we have, are at his diſpoſal. And it is beſt for us to rejoice at all times, that we are in his hands, who
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:033734_0050_0FF8F132E025A510"/>
cannot do a wrong thing: "For ſhall not the God of all the earth do right?" And my dear child, let us ſo live, as that we ſhall not be afraid to die.</p>
            <p>That you may be returned to us in peace, experience every bleſſing while in this world, and at laſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by your Judge in peace, is the earneſt prayer of your affectionate mother,</p>

            <p>I RECEIVED your kind letter; and it greatly rejoiced my heart, to find you ſo kind to me, and to have you relate your affairs to me, eſpecially my father's reformation. And, dear ma'am, if the loſs of his eſtate has opened his eyes, to ſee the empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the things of this world, when compared to virtue; and to ſee the preference of religion to riches; I think he has gained more than he has loſt. And O, ma'am, how acceptable was my father's bleſſing to me, which I prize above all my father's eſtate. Upon reading your kind letter, to find my father was well inclined to Mr. Danford, and that he gave his conſent to our marriage; and then to receive his bleſſing in form, was almoſt too much for me. Tears of joy ran plentifully from my eyes; and, indeed, it ſeemed to raiſe me above myſelf; and I was in ſuch an ecſtacy,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:033734_0051_0FF8F1378598FFA8"/>
that 'twas ſome time before I could find myſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to my proper orbit again.</p>
            <p>As for my father, I do moſt heartily forgive, and will entirely forget whatever he has done, that was grievous to me. And, dear ma'am, tell him that I will do all in my power, to extricate him out of his preſent embarraſſment. You know the eſtate that my uncle left me, has been let for a number of years, and the rent is now due; which, with the money that I have on intereſt, will amount to a conſiderable ſum; and, if he chuſes, he may call on my truſtee for that money, before my return.</p>
            <p>But I hope it will not be long before I ſhall have the happineſs of throwing myſelf before you both, and receiving your bleſſing from your own mouths. For Mr. Danford has arrived here, having made a capital return; and will accompany this, with a letter to my father.</p>
            <p>I ſhowed him the letter that I received from you; and he was much pleaſed that my father was reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him. My uncle will write, and therefore I ſhall not ſay any thing about him. And I ſuppoſe you have ſeen the letter I ſent to Mrs. Sophia Granbe; for which reaſons, I ſhall not give you any account of my uncle's family; only that they continue to ſhow me every mark of affection and kindneſs; and ſeem to be as tender of me, as if I was one of their daughters. My uncle is ſet upon it, that I ſhall be married at his houſe: he always calls me his eldeſt daughter; and he ſays, his eldeſt daughter ſhall not be married out of his houſe.</p>

            <p>PERMIT me to addreſs you with a line on a very tender and intereſting ſubject; and, dear Sir, let it meet with your approbation. When I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at this place, Mr. Finter informed me that your daughter was at his houſe; and invited me to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, which I did with the greateſt pleaſure imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable: for I need not inform you, that ſhe engroſſes all my attention, and that my heart is wholly her's; and ſorry I am, that there was any miſunderſtanding between you and I. But I flatter myſelf, that what you did at that time proceeded from a true paternal care of, and affection towards your daughter, and not to any perſonal diſlike to myſelf. In hopes of a more favourable reception, I venture to addreſs you on that ſubject again, and aſk your conſent to our marriage.

            <p>WE have heard of your loſſes and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, and do truly ſympathize with you in your troubles. But we muſt conſider that theſe are all the doings of Providence, whoſe ways are paſt finding out, and knows how to lay afflictions on his children; and at the ſame time, bring good out of evil. For many times he doth try them in the furnace of affliction, that thoſe virtues, which lay buried in the droſs of the world, may ſhine forth and be conſpicuous to thoſe that are around them. And I doubt not, but theſe afflictions of your's will all work for your good. Nay, I am morally certain, that they will. You muſt be patient, arming your mind with virtue and religion.</p>
            <p>But I have another ſubject to write upon: for Mr. Danford has returned from the Eaſt Indies, and has arrived here with the richeſt cargo I ever ſaw. He has taken up his lodgings at my houſe, and I am en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured with him. For indeed, brother, he is every thing one could wiſh for in a gentleman. He has a noble mind, that is above every little action, is ſober, virtuous, and well-bred: and, in ſhort, he is endowed with every accompliſhment that will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeak one's eſteem and affections. I underſtand you did not affect Mr. Danford before he went his voyage; but I hope you have thought better of the matter ſince: for I muſt tell you, that if he addreſſed one of my daughters, and had not the tenth part of the eſtate which he now has, yet I ſhould rather encourage him, than that ſhe ſhould be married to one of an independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent fortune, who wanted his endowments. And as
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:033734_0054_0FF8F14902E3FD80"/>
Polly has been ſome time with us, (and indeed I look upon her as one of my own daughters) I muſt requeſt you to conſent, that ſhe may give her hand to Mr. Danford, who is, at preſent, in poſſeſſion of her heart. And I intend ſhe ſhall be married at my houſe, and you muſt give your conſent to both of theſe propoſals; for indeed, I cannot be denied. After which Mr. Danford will convey her to your houſe, and in him you will find a ſon, that you will not be aſhamed of. I ſhall depend upon a letter from you, as ſoon as you can convey it, for I have begun to prepare for the nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials already.

            <head>LETTER XXI. From Mr. <hi>GRANVILLE,</hi> to Mr. <hi>DANFORD.</hi>

               <salute>Much honour'd Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I RECEIVED your letter, and am rejoiced that you have arrived in ſafety to this country again. I want to ſee you very much; for my behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you before you went your voyage, was altogeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er exceptionable; and indeed, I am greatly aſhamed of my conduct, for which I now aſk your forgiveneſs.</p>
            <p>But in your letter, you aſk my forgiveneſs. Does Mr. Danford aſk my forgiveneſs? And for what?
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:033734_0055_0FF8BFA1C69A46F0"/>
I am ſure, Sir, you never wronged me in the leaſt— your behaviour, Sir, was ever conſiſtent with virtue, and a religious mind—whilſt mine was quite the reverſe. For at that time my whole mind was ſet on riches and grandeur. But ſince your abſence, I have experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſuch viciſſitudes in fortune, as I think hath fully opened my eyes. And now it appears to me, that wealth ought not to be mentioned in compariſon of virtue. Indeed, Sir, religion appears beautiful to me. And now I hope you will not look upon me with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence, as I know you love thoſe who love relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion.</p>
            <p>You wrote to me for my conſent to your entering into an alliance with our family, which I freely grant with pleaſure: and you may either bring Polly home before you are married, or may complete your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at my brother's—as you chuſe. For my brother is ſomewhat earneſt that the ceremony ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at his houſe. I ſhall expect you will pay your compliments to us as ſoon as you conveniently can: for you muſt not reſent my conduct to you. And as I know you are of a kind, forgiving temper, I doubt not but you will overlook thoſe faults I have been guilty of. And do tell Polly, that ſhe ſhould forgive me the wrong I have done her, and not think hard of me. For at that time I did really think, that I was ſeeking her good. But a perſon that is blinded with the world, will many times do wrong things; and let her be aſſured, that I love her as well as a father ought to love a child—Jenny and ſhe, being all the children that we have left.</p>
            <p>Mr. Murfee's behaviour towards us, has been quite exceptionable: for he deſerted us in the greateſt of our difficulty, and has quite forſaken our family. But all is for the beſt, for it gave me a diſlike to thoſe men who make this world their god; and it gave me a rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh to virtue and religion. And I do rejoice now that thoſe things have befallen me.</p>
            <p>And now, dear Sir, let me commend you to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine care and keeping; and may we live in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:033734_0056_0FF8F14B3784D078"/>
of thoſe virtues that will recommend us in this world, and that which is to come.</p>
            <p>Allow me to conclude, by ſending you my bleſſing,</p>

               <salute>Honoured Brother,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I RECEIVED your kind letter with pleaſure, being rejoiced to hear of your welfare. And O, how acceptable was your kind condolence for our affliction, and your ſo ſeaſonable advice to us under thoſe misfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unes! It ſeemed like a cordial to the fainting heart. And indeed, brother, the letters that we have received from your houſe, have put new life into us. For the ways of Providence, many times, appear to us to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate and full of windings, and we can no ways com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them. But how often is it that theſe things which we think are againſt us, are the very means deſigned for our good. And how often is it that thoſe adverſe providences towards us, work a change in our minds, and brings the creature to ſee his dependance on the Supreme Being. When this is the caſe, the perſon afflicted, can kiſs the rod, and ſay, "It is good for me that I have been afflicted." And I humbly hope, that this is the effect which trouble hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in my mind: for the world doth not appear to me as it uſed to. And indeed I think I have a real love for virtue and religion. I believe you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice at this declaration, as coming from one that uſed to make the world his chiefeſt good. But, dear Sir, you muſt own me now for a brother, in a double ſenſe. And I flatter myſelf that you will—for I know that virtue and religion was ever your boaſt, and you ever
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:033734_0057_0FF8F14FAF9FD560"/>
ſeemed to live above the world, although your poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were large in it. This is the more admirable in you, as it is rare, for a very rich man to mind thoſe things which will terminate in true happineſs.</p>
            <p>As to what you wrote to me, concerning Mr. Danford, and Polly, I have wrote to Mr. Danford, and have given my conſent to their union; it will be needleſs for me to ſay any thing to you about it. You wrote to me, deſiring, that they might be married at your houſe. I ſhould be very glad to have the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony performed at my houſe. But, as my daughter Polly found a father in you; I ſhall ſubmit the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to have it performed, where it ſhall be moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to you.</p>
            <p>As to your recommendation of Mr. Danford, I muſt tell you, that he now ſtands as high in my eſteem, as he does, or can do, in yours. And I now ſee the folly, in doing, as I did, by him and Polly. For I really carried my reſentment to an outrageous extremity. But as I now repent of my folly, I hope they will both forgive me. And I am determined to aſk their forgiveneſs in form. You muſt tell them, that I have fully repented of what I did to them; and try to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them to think well of me; and I know they are both of a kind forgiving temper; therefore, I flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that they will be reconciled to me, and that we ſhall yet be happy in each other.</p>
            <p>Your ſiſter deſires to join with me, in ſending our love to you and your family. That theſe may find you as they leave us, enjoying health, and peace of mind, prays your affectionate brother, and humble ſervant,</p>

            <head>LETTER XXIII. From Miſs <hi>POLLY GRANVILLE,</hi> to Mrs. SOPHIA GRANBE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My dear Mrs. Granbe,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I MUST write you the particulars of Mr. Danford's arrival, and alſo of our marriage. As to the firſt, my uncle came home one day, and ſaid he had been in company with a choice friend of his, and that he had invited him to take tea with us in the afternoon, deſiring the family might be properly dreſſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him. And as he was a particular friend of his, he hoped we would receive him as politely as poſſible. All this time I did not in the leaſt miſtruſt who it ſhould be; but my aunt told me afterwards that ſhe did; for, upon her aſking my uncle who this friend of his could be, whom he wiſhed us to receive with ſo much parade? He anſwered, that perhaps ſhe might know him when he came; and ſo waved the ſubject.</p>
            <p>Well, after dining, we all dreſſed anew; and the whole houſe was ſo diſpoſed, as to receive the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known ſtranger with all the politeneſs imaginable. My aunt, her daughter, and I, were ſetting together in the parlour, when my uncle entered, and with him Mr. Danford, Upon ſeeing him I aroſe, and immediately run into his arms; for the ſurpriſe was ſo ſudden, I knew not what I did. O, Mr. Danford, ſaid I. And indeed that was all I could ſay; for the interview was too much for my weak frame of body to bear; and I fainted in his arms, which greatly perplexed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; but they ſoon recovered me again. My dear, ſaid my aunt to my uncle, you did not do well to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize our niece to this degree. But my uncle ſaid that he did not in the leaſt expect it would have had ſuch an effect on me; and that I muſt forgive him.</p>
            <p>After the firſt emotion was over, Mr. Danford ſaid
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:033734_0059_0FF8F1538D37E940"/>
a hundred tender things to me, and ſoothed me in the beſt manner he could. And indeed, he never appeared to me in ſuch an amiable light before; for he was richly dreſſed: and beſides, there was that nobleneſs in his looks, which denotes real grandeur, and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous greatneſs. And he ſeemed to be more tender of me now, than when I was in proſperity in my fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's houſe; and ſays, he is glad it is in his power to retrieve my father's affairs, which, he ſays, he means to do, as ſoon as he arrives in thoſe parts again, My dear Polly, ſaid he to me, you muſt not think hard of me, though your ſufferings have been great on my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; nor for my leaving this country at the time of your trouble; for it was attended with pungent grief to me; and was wholly on your account in order to gain you your liberty. And I cannot but hope, that your father thinks more favourably of me by this time. Dear Sir, ſaid I, you know my mind relative to your going abroad; and it is matter of joy to me, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts you in my eſteem, that you did not abandon me under the inſulting treatment you met with, from my father. But I know, Sir, that you are not capable of any meanneſs; that your mind is ſteady and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent; and I ever ſuppoſed it was ſafe truſting to your word. And as to what you ſaid concerning my father's thinking better of you now than formerly, I can aſſure you, Sir, that he does: for I have a letter, in my hands, which makes it obvious that my father's mind is quite altered from what it uſed to be.</p>
            <p>And indeed, Mrs. Granbe, his eyes gliſtened with noble ſenſibility And there ſeems to be a meaning in every turn of his countenance. Well, after he had ſeated himſelf again, I put my mother's letter into his hand which contained the particulars of my father's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; which he read ſeveral times over; and then ſaid, I am exceeding ſorry for your father's misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. But, as your mother writes, it may be all for the beſt. As for Mr. Murfee, it ſeems he has behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a moſt ſhocking manner. Not to aſſiſt in their diſtreſs, the family he is ſo nearly connected with, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers neither the ſon, nor the humane heart. How
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:033734_0060_0FF8F155F0EA9928"/>
could he be ſo cruel? Is it poſſible that the noble crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, man, ſhould be ſo void of humanity? But your father, my dear Polly, ſtands high in my eſteem; and I love him with a real affection. And it ſhall be one of my firſt concerns, when I return home, to ſet your father on as good a footing as he was before. There ever was a dignity in that man's looks, which excited my veneration. And now to have the gracious mind, joined to his other noble qualifications, will really ſet him in a ſphere above any in thoſe parts. What ſay you, Polly, to theſe propoſitions?</p>
            <p>Dear Sir, ſaid I, ſuch generoſity, and unmerited kindneſs, is almoſt too much for me to bear. And what ſhall I do on my part, to deſerve all this good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from you? But it is conſiſtent with your noble turn of mind. You will then forgive my father, and think well of him, and forget what he hath done to you? Yes, my dear, ſaid he, I will. For I ever thought that his ſeverity was owing to his love to you. For, though his aims were wrong, yet, doubtleſs, his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were good. And it is our duty to think as well of him now, ſince he has repented of that evil, as if he had never been guilty of it. Dear Sir, ſaid I, your generoſity is without an equal; and it ſhall be my care to merit as much with you as I can.</p>
            <p>My uncle and aunt alſo gave their minds on this topic; but I have confined myſelf wholly to what he ſaid on the ſubject. Well, Mr. Danford took up his lodgings at my uncle's, upon his invitation; ſo that we were more or leſs together every day. Mr. Danford wrote to my father for his conſent to our mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and received an anſwer full of kind expreſſions, with a cheerful conſent to our marriage, which raiſed every tender emotion in Mr. Danford, and occaſioned his ſaying many tender things to me on that ſubject. Indeed, he is always full of complacency to me; and is exceeding polite to me in company; ever ſhowing me that preference, when in company, which is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic of the real lover, and generous mind.</p>
            <p>My uncle wrote to my father for his conſent to our being married at his houſe; which my father gave him,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:033734_0061_0FF8F158DC21A130"/>
in a letter full of endearing expreſſions, at leaſt they were ſo to me, for it was a penitent one; my father condemning himſelf, and ſpeaking exceeding well of virtue, which was pleaſing to us all. But my uncle ſaid, that my father ever ſtood high in his eſteem; and he thought that he never lacked but one thing, which was religion. And now he is poſſeſſed of that qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he muſt, in my eſteem, outſhine any that I know of.</p>
            <p>And Polly, ſaid he, you may, and ought to rejoice, that you have ſuffered; for that, I believe, has partly been the means of opening his eyes. And you may now return to your father, who will ſet more by you than if you had never offended him: and I hope nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mr. Danford, nor you, will retain the leaſt reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt him. But, on the contrary, endeavour to ſoothe him, mitigate his affliction, and make his mind as eaſy as poſſible, under his preſent difficulties; and you will be richly paid for what you do for him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even in worldly intereſt: for your father is yet in poſſeſſion of a conſiderable eſtate.</p>
            <p>Mr. Danford ſaid, that he would make it one of his firſt concerns after his return home, to deliver my fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er out of all difficulty. And as for his behaviour to him in times paſt, he ſhould entirely bury it in oblivion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I alſo aſſured my uncle, that my parents ſhould have no reaſon to find fault with my behaviour to them. I am rejoiced, ſaid my uncle, to hear you make this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration! And as my brother has conſented for you to be married at my houſe, agreeable to the requeſt I made in my letter to him, you may ſet the time when the ceremony ſhall be performed, and we will make prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations accordingly.</p>
            <p>Mr. Danford ſaid that he wiſhed to have his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs completed, as ſoon as it conveniently could be, and ſo they ſet the day. After this, my uncle brought home ſeveral pieces of ſilk, for me to chooſe a ſuit out of; and would inſiſt on my making a choice, which I accordingly did. He furniſhed me with a ſuit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, and Mr. Danford gave me a ſecond-day ſuit. Now you will think that your Polly was gorgeouſly apparelled; well, ſo I was, and they would have it ſo; for my uncle intended to invite many of his friends,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:033734_0062_0FF8F15B17E314F0"/>
to attend the nuptials. Well, at length the appointed time came; but I did not find myſelf cheerful as uſual; neither could I make myſelf ſo for the life of me. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I have often wondered how a perſon can enter into that ſolemn covenant, with ſuch gaiety, and thoughtleſſneſs as I have ſeen ſome: for it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me to be a ſolemn undertaking; and it always uſed to impreſs my mind with awe, to ſee a couple mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. But then, many look upon marriage to be only a ceremony, prefixed by the civil authority, to oblige a man to take care of his wife, and to keep families from ſeparating. But I always looked upon marriage to be a divine ordinance; and it is obvious from the word of truth, that it is ſo. But now, when I came to enter into that covenant myſelf, it appeared more awful to me than ever. But I was reſolved to hold up as well as I could.</p>
            <p>Well, the meſſenger coming in to inform us, that they were ready to receive us, Mr. Danford took me by the hand, and ſpake very encouraging to me; ſo we ſtepped into the other room; but tremble, trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble went my feet all the way! Lay ſtill, ſaid I, you little fool! why ſhould you be ſo uneaſy? For my heart was ready to leave its orbit. After the firſt flut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was over, I held up better, while the ceremony was performing, than I was afraid I ſhould.</p>
            <p>As to our gueſts, my uncle had got together a noble circle of the beſt gentry in the city; and after the nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials were over, they were nobly entertained by him; and all was conducted in a modeſt, ſociable manner; and after we had ſpent a very agreeable evening to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, the company withdrew, about eleven; and the next day we had again a conſiderable company; and indeed we were obliged to give up the whole week to entertainment and pleaſure. We had ſo much parade, that I was quite tired of it.</p>
            <p>Well, the next Sunday I muſt be dreſſed to the beſt advantage, to make our public appearance at church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For my uncle is a man of note here, and Mr. Danford is looked upon very highly in this city; all ſeeming to be fond of an acquaintance with him. After dreſſing
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:033734_0063_0FF8F16049337FD0"/>
myſelf very richly, agreeable to their deſire, we ſet out, attended by my uncle and aunt, and a young couple, that my uncle invited for that purpoſe. When we came to the meeting houſe, my uncle aided us into his pew; but it gave me another flutter, in ſpite of all I could do; for the eyes of all the congregation were upon us. But the ſolemnity of the place awed my mind into a frame of devotion; and ſo I held up bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than I expected.</p>
            <p>There was nothing more occurred that was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, except that the next week we were crowded with company.</p>
            <p>Now, I will tell you what preparations we are in to return to my father's. As Mr. Danford did not own a coach, he has bought one here; and ſo we ſhall ride home in ſtate. But we ſhall not be accompanied by any beſides my maid and the coachman.</p>
            <p>I forgot to tell you, that Mr. Danford, before we were married, preſented my maid Ann with a new ſuit, which mightily pleaſed her.</p>
            <p>Mr. Danford has adjuſted all his affairs relative to the cargo he has had unloaded here; and the Captain is to proceed with the ſhip, whilſt we go by land. We ſhall ſet out ſometime next week, ſo that you may ſoon expect us in your part of the country again. I long to receive my father's bleſſing from his own mouth, and again to embrace my dear So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.

               <salute>Ever dear, and much honour'd Uncle and Aunt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS you engaged me to write to you, and inform you of our arrival at my father's houſe, and how he received us, &amp;c. and as it was ever a pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure to me to obey my ſecond father and mother, as I uſed to call you, I will proceed, hoping you will make allowances for my imperfections.</p>
            <p>Setting out from your houſe at Philadelphia, we came by eaſy journies, ſtopping a day or two at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry town of note, till we arrived at this town, and put up at Mr. Danford's couſin Fitcher's. Mr. Fitcher is a very polite gentleman, but as we did not arrive till dark, we had no company that night, and glad I was that we had not.</p>
            <p>Mr. Danford and Mr. Fitcher had much diſcourſe about my father. Mr. Fitcher ſaid, he believed my father would be able to carry on his trade, though he had met with great loſſes. But his landed intereſt was mortgaged; and he believed that his farms muſt be loſt to him, as he did not think it poſſible for him to redeem them, which was a pity—for they were mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for not more than one half of their real value. And upon Mr. Danford's enquiry, he told him, that the mortgage was not out, and that the man who held the deeds was my father's friend; and wanted nothing more, than to be made whole, and would give them up at any time.</p>
            <p>The next morning Mr. Danford went to ſee the man who had the deeds, and ſoon after came in and delivered me all the deeds of my father's farms, (and you know he was in poſſeſſion of ſeveral farms.) Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on handing me the papers, he ſaid, my dear, you may
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:033734_0065_0FF8BF9A79AF0F30"/>
give them to your father, or I will myſelf, as you ſhall think proper. But I returned him the papers, chuſing he ſhould deliver them himſelf.</p>
            <p>Soon after, Mr. Danford ſent a ſervant to my fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's, to inform him that we were in town, and if he wiſhed to ſee us at his houſe, and to know when he would have us wait upon him, who returned for anſwer, that he ſhould expect us in the afternoon. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, after dining, we went in the coach. Mr. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford would have me dreſſed in the ſuit my uncle gave me, and he was charmingly dreſſed himſelf.</p>
            <p>When we arrived at my father's, we were met at the door, and conducted into the parlour, where my fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and mother were waiting, ready to receive us.— When we entered the parlour, my father, riſing, ſaid, welcome, Mr. Danford, into theſe parts again; and thrice welcome to my houſe! And after Mr. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford had returned him the uſual compliment of thanks, my father, ſtepping to him, took his hand and ſaid, I aſk your forgiveneſs, Sir, for the ill uſage I ſhowed you before you went your Eaſtern voyage.— Sir, ſaid Mr. Danford, you did nothing uncommon to me—nothing at leaſt, that requires forgiveneſs: but if you are anxious, Sir, for a further declaration, I am ready to ſatisfy you. And if you think you have done any thing to me that was unbecoming a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in your capacity, I do freely forgive you. And ſhall ever reſpect and behave towards you, as if there never had been any miſunderſtanding between us: and hope, Sir, that I ſhall be enabled to conduct myſelf towards you and others, that you will not diſdain to call me your ſon. At this, Mr. Danford took me by the hand and preſented me to him, ſaying, dear Sir, your daughter—will you be pleaſed to receive her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to favour, and give her your bleſſing?</p>
            <p>My father took me by the hand, and I dropping on my knees before him, ſaid, dear Sir, will you forgive your Polly, and grant her your bleſſing? At this, my father raiſing me up, ſaid, ſtand up, my dear child—for I want to aſk you, whether you can, and will forgive me freely from your heart, all the ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:033734_0066_0FF8F143F7BB3E10"/>
that I uſed towards you? Dear Sir, ſaid I, you muſt not aſk your Polly ſuch a queſtion! But Polly, ſaid he, if you can forgive me, you muſt ſay you will. Dear Sir, ſaid I, I do forgive you whatever you may have done amiſs to me: and now, Sir, you will give me your bleſſing and receive me into favour again, won't you?</p>
            <p>My bleſſing you have, ſaid he, and may you both be a bleſſing to each other! And may you enjoy the beſt of heaven's bleſſings; and be an honour to the place you live in! And I am ſatisfied, becauſe you are returned to us in peace; and do not deſpiſe us, but will yet look upon us with love, and filial affections. Then turning to my mother, he ſaid, my dear, here I preſent you with a ſon and daughter, that would do honour to any family on earth.</p>
            <p>Then my mother took us both by the hand, and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed us to her houſe. Saying, that ſhe promiſed herſelf great comfort in us, ſeeing the former miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings were to be buried in oblivion. After we were ſeated, and had got into converſation, Mr. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford aſked my father concerning the perplexed ſtate of his affairs, which he has hinted at in his letter to him? And whether he had been able to extricate himſelf out of theſe difficulties, that he then laboured under?</p>
            <p>My father anſwered, that his affairs were much in the ſame ſituation that they were when he wrote; only, that he believed he was rather upon the gaining hand.</p>
            <p>At this, Mr. Danford ſtepped to him, and gave him the mortgage deeds, which he had purchaſed; and ſaid, there is a ſmall preſent, Sir; and if you are elſewhere involved, and will notice the matter to me, I ſhall hold myſelf obligated to extricate you as ſoon as poſſible. But when my father came to ſee what he gave him, he roſe up, and ſaid, Sir, your kindneſs is too great for me to bear! But as you have done this, I will imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately put you into the poſſeſſion of all thoſe farms that you have reſtored to me</p>
            <p>Sir, ſaid Mr. Danford, I did not preſent them to you to be repaid again; and I ſhall not receive any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity on that account.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="unknown:033734_0067_0FF8F1650C6BE6B0"/>Now I ſee, ſaid my father, the triumph of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous mind over the covetous worldling. For there is no compariſon between the man that ſquares all his doings by the rule of religion; and one that makes this world his idol, and is hurried on by an impetuous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire after riches and grandeur. Then turning to my mother, ſaid, how unlike this, was our ſon Murfee? For we offered him the land, if he would only take up the deeds, ſo that the eſtate might not go into the hands of a ſtranger. But he refuſed us with contempt; and made himſelf ſtrange to our family, and forgot the duty of a child to a parent. But then, Murfee is wholly a man of this world, and makes no diſtinction between virtue and vice; riches and grandeur appearing to be the moſt eſſential articles in his creed. And we ſee, my dear, continued he, in every occurrence of life, the preference of virtue to wealth. And I deſire to be thankful, that of late my eyes have been opened in ſuch a meaſure as to make the diſtinction. Then turning to Mr. Danford, ſaid, I acknowledge, Sir, that the kindneſs you have done me is great; and that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple from which you govern theſe actions muſt be wholly centered in virtue. And, in future, I ſhall look upon you in as near a relation as if you were my own ſon: and ſhall inſiſt upon your joining your inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt with mine, that we may carry on an inſeparable trade together: and what I have in the world you muſt look upon as your own. And you muſt not think of living in any houſe but mine. It is capacious enough for two families; and you muſt not deny me this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; for I ſhall always want your perſon near me. Your counſel and conduct will be a means to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en theſe good principles, and laudable deſires, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to bud forth in my heart.</p>
            <p>And then turning to me he ſaid, happy, thrice hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is my dear Polly! who was enabled to withſtand my anger, and to deſpiſe what then looked promiſing, as to the things of this world; having her views wholly governed by virtue. You have at laſt, my dear child, eſcaped all the ſnares that were laid for you; and now your perſeverance is crowned by an alliance with one
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:033734_0068_0FF8F166AB3C0610"/>
of the nobleſt men this age can produce. May you ſpend many happy days together; and, finally, may you be unſeparated in the world of joy and happineſs!</p>
            <p>My dear uncle and aunt, you may well think this diſcourſe was pleaſing to me. How pleaſing indeed muſt it be, to ſee my father's eyes gliſten with rapture, and his looks full of noble ſenſibility; every word be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpoke with energy, and his countenance carrying a meaning in it, beyond the power of words to expreſs! My mother ſeemed to indulge the anticipation of what might be the reſult of this interview; tears of joy ſometimes eſcaping her eyes, though ſhe ſeemed to ſtrive againſt it. And, indeed, we all were more or leſs affected with the interview. But pleaſure ſeemed to pervade all our minds, and brighten each one's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
            <p>In the evening, we were waited upon by ſeveral of the neighbouring gentry: and we ſpent a very ſocial evening together. And, the next day, my father in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited many of them, to dine with us, and welcome us into theſe parts again. Indeed, the company of ſo many of my acquaintance, was very entertaining to me. They complimented us highly on our nuptials; and my father related to them what Mr. Danford had done for him. He ſpoke exceeding highly of him to the company; and would run on in his praiſe, though evidently againſt Mr. Danford's inclination. But he is ſo pleaſing to my father, now, that he ſays, he muſt ſpeak well of him in all company; and that he doth not think he will be lifted up by it; becauſe, ſays he<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mr. Danford is above pride<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He alſo ſpoke very kindly to me, and ſhewed me that tenderneſs before the company, as muſt convince them, that he was fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to me. He likewiſe took an occaſion, to tell the whole circle how much he was delighted with me; and how glad he was, that I had made a virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man my early choice; and had been enabled to ſtand againſt every temptation, and hard treatment, in order to ſecure to myſelf one that was as virtuous as I was. And now I do rejoice, continued he, that her happineſs is crowned in one that ſhe cannot be more
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:033734_0069_0FF8F16A9017A8D0"/>
proud in calling her companion, than I am in calling my ſon. And as they have forgiven me, and all paſt miſunderſtandings are to be buried in oblivion, I think there is a proſpect of our being very happy together— which happineſs, it ſhall be my endeavour to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.</p>
            <p>The company ſtaid till quite late, and then retired, giving us a thouſand good wiſhes, and ſeeming to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate in our happineſs.</p>
            <p>Well, as the poſt was to ſet out the next day, I hurried to get my ſcribbles ready to ſend forward to you. And now my dear uncle and aunt, am I not richly repaid for all the trials and troubles that I have met with? For I am now returned to a virtuous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and religious father, who is no longer that ſelfiſh world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling he uſed to be, but is a great advocate for virtue, and religious duties, which will not fail delighting one, who thinks well of theſe things. And then, to be received by my father with ſuch open cordiality, to have his affections all flowing upon me again; and to ſee the ſpeaking joy of his countenance, every time we come into his preſence, is a matter of great joy and thankfulneſs with me.</p>
            <p>As for the propoſal that my father made Mr. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, of living with him, I cannot tell whether we ſhall accept of it or not.</p>
            <p>And now, my dear uncle and aunt, accept of my thanks, for the favours I have received from you, and of my beſt wiſhes, for your health and happineſs.— Pleaſe to give my love to your family, and my compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to all inquiring friends.</p>

            <head>LETTER XXV. From Mrs. <hi>POLLY DANFORD,</hi> to Mrs. FINTER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Much honour'd, and greatly eſteemed Uncle and Aunt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I AGAIN write, agreeable to your requeſt, and ſhall inform you of our further proceedings. My father continues to ſhow Mr. Danford every mark of diſtinction. Soon after I wrote you laſt, as we were all ſetting together, my father directing himſelf to Mr. Danford, ſaid, have you conſidered of the propoſal I made you, relative to our connecting our intereſt, and becoming but one in eſtate and family? Perhaps, Sir, ſaid Mr. Danford, if I ſhould join you, as you deſire, it might give offence to Mr. Murfee and his wife, and I ſhould be loath to do any thing, that might incur their diſpleaſure. And then I do not know whether it would be right for me to conſider your eſtate as my own—would it, Sir?</p>
            <p>Why truly, Mr. Danford, ſaid my father, neither Murfee nor Jenny can expect I ſhould do much for them. For when I applied to him in my difficulty, he turned a deaf ear to my complaint, although I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulated with him, and told him it would not be for the credit of the family, to let the eſtate go into the hands of a ſtranger; yet he treated me with inſult and contempt. I then made him the offer I now make you; but he refuſed, and treated me with abuſive language, which raiſed my diſpleaſure and indignation againſt him, and all thoſe who ſquare all their doings by a view of ſelf-intereſt, and are making an idol of themſelves. But it had this effect on me, that it cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to think there muſt be ſomething in religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a mere form; and that brought me into a courſe
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:033734_0071_0FF8F16CCAE765A8"/>
of thinking, which has terminated in the full belief of the reality and importance of a religious courſe of life, which I hope I practice in ſome meaſure. And now I want your aſſiſtance in my worldly affairs, and your advice and example in the matters of a ſpiritual nature. And as to what you ſaid, concerning Mr. Murfee and Jenny, I ſhall ſubmit the matter to your judgment, to do as you ſhall think juſt and right; for I would not wiſh to do him wrong, though he has diſpleaſed me. But you muſt not deny me the requeſt I have made. Mr. Danford in reply ſaid, if you will do this, Sir, I will come into the meaſure you propoſed, viz. let your eſtate be valued, and a juſt inventory taken, of all the eſtate you was in poſſeſſion of, at the time I came to your houſe; and let it ſtand in a fair manner, to be ſeen hereafter, and then I will join my eſtate with your's, and we will carry on but one intereſt.</p>
            <p>At this my father ſaid he would fully acquieſce; and would ſet about the buſineſs as ſoon as poſſible. And now, continued he, I can ſee the preference of virtue to any thing elſe; for when you could have made my whole eſtate your own, you refuſed it from a regard of juſtice. But what ſhall I ſay to you, my dear ſon and daughter? You will doubtleſs be bleſſed in this world, and that which is to come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and you will be a bleſſing to me, lightening my burden, and cauſing me to ſpend the remainder of my days in quiet and happineſs.</p>
            <p>Well, my dear uncle and aunt, we have got all theſe matters ſettled, and we now live in one houſe, and have but one intereſt. And indeed their ſtock in trade is very large, which enables them to carry it on to great advantage. We live exceeding happy together, for my father is very fond of Mr. Danford; and Mr. Danford is careful to aſk advice of him, in every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking of any importance. And ſo you ſee we are as happy as one could think of being in this world of uncertainty, change and trouble. My dear uncle and aunt, don't you think that many of the troubles we labour under ariſe from ourſelves? and that we bring them on us by our own miſconduct? I am led to think
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:033734_0072_0FF8BFB8F616C188"/>
that is many times the caſe. For oftentimes we get uneaſy in our minds, and murmur at all we meet with; and we often fault others, when, at the ſame time, our troubles ariſe from our own baſeneſs of heart: for our unruly hearts will run into faulty meaſures, if we don't keep a ſtrict watch over them, and then we ſhall be led to wrong our fellow-creatures, which will procure us many enemies, and thoſe enemies will try to be reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on us; which will lead us into many entanglements and troubles; when, at the ſame time, if we would only trace the matter to its ſource, we ſhould find it would terminate in our own hearts.</p>
            <p>But with our family, every affair is conducted by the rule of ſtrict juſtice, which gains us many friends.</p>
            <p>And now, my dear aunt, as we have got into a reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular way of living, you muſt expect no more adventures from me: and yet, perhaps, I may write you ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of our viſits; for we are going to pay Mrs. Granbe one ſoon.</p>
            <p>With my beſt reſpects to you, and compliments to all my friends, I haſten to ſubſcribe myſelf yours, &amp;c.</p>

            <head>LETTER XXVI. From Mrs. <hi>POLLY DANFORD,</hi> to her Aunt FINTER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Ever dear Aunt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I AGAIN aſſume my pen, as I have engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to write you every thing that is worth notice. Since I wrote to you laſt, I have made ſeveral viſits; and there are ſome particulars in our converſations, that I wiſh to let you into. In the firſt place, we paid a viſit to my dear Mrs. Sophia Granbe; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally Mr. Granbe is a delightful man, indeed he is!
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:033734_0073_0FF8F17212DB9F18"/>
Well, I will give you the particulars of our tour. As we went in the coach, he and I had a conſiderable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation together; in which he was pleaſed to remind me of ſeveral things that he wiſhed to have obſerved in his family. And his diſcourſe was delivered with ſuch love, and tenderneſs, that I am ſure it was very pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me. And indeed he ever treats me with that tenderneſs which denotes the noble mind, and gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart. This fully ſecures me in his honour, and leaves me no room to diſtruſt his love or fidelity.</p>
            <p>Well, the firſt thing that he mentioned to me was, that whenever he ſhould invite a friend home with him, or have one call upon him, he wiſhed to have ſuch an one received with every mark of polite atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Let your buſineſs, ſaid he, be what it will, or the perſon ever ſo obnoxious to you, yet I ſhall expect that you will not receive ſuch with indifference. For a woman, continued he, to ſhow by her countenance, words or behaviour, that the perſon ſo invited is not welcome, gives the perſon a very diſagreeable feeling, and at the ſame time reflects diſhonour on the man. And the man, you know, cannot be diſhonoured with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his companion's participating in the ſame diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. For often, my dear, have I been at houſes, where the wife's conduct plainly ſhewed that I was not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; when, at the ſame time, the gentleman of the houſe was urgent for me to call upon him. And once in particular I will mention: Falling in company one evening with a gentleman, we ſoon got acquainted, and he very urgently inſiſted upon my going home, and ſpending the night with him. I being at a diſtance from home, after a little heſitation, accepted his invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. But when we arrived at his houſe, his wife behaved quite odly; for ſhe never roſe from her ſeat, but fixed her eyes on the fire; and after the firſt volley at her companion, was quite dumb. He ſet me a chair, and I ſeated myſelf. He then ordered ſome refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but in vain. He then addreſſed himſelf to me, and ſaid, it is but a few ſteps, Sir, to an houſe of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. Upon this, I bid him good by, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew. How the man felt, you may judge; for I muſt
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:033734_0074_0FF8F174E8BB2B78"/>
confeſs it gave me a diſagreeable feeling. Indeed, the man and woman were both to blame. He, for not inſtructing her better; and ſhe, for inſulting him to ſuch a degree. Such behaviour reflects diſgrace on any family. The wife ought ever to receive her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's acquaintance with an open and cheerful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; and uſe ſuch an one with all the politeneſs ſhe is capable of. Becauſe, if ſhe reſpects her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſhe muſt, and will reſpect his friends. At leaſt, that is the rule which we generally judge by.</p>
            <p>I don't think, my dear, ſaid he, you are capable of ſuch an enormity; yet I wanted to expreſs my mind to you on this ſubject. And there are ſeveral other things that I want juſt to mention. One is, that I ſhould wiſh to have you always dreſſed, and the houſe put in order, early in the day; then company would never find you unprepared to receive them. For, at many places, when one calls in to ſee a friend, they are wholly unprepared to receive one; and then there is ſuch a running, and dreſſing, and ſlutter in the whole family, that it takes off all the pleaſure of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and one wiſhes themſelves at home again. And as to the hour of retiring to reſt at night, and ariſing in the morning; I ſhould chuſe to go to reſt at ten, and riſe early in the morning. But perhaps you will ſay, that this is quite unfaſhionable; and how will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany join with us in this unpolite practice? I anſwer, that in my opinion, 'tis in the power of every man to preſcribe rules for his own family, and adhere to thoſe rules without giving offence. And I ſhall make it my practice, always, to withdraw from company, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to my houſe, at nine in the evening; and when others ſee that this is my practice, they will do the ſame when they are at my houſe. And thus we ſhall have ſome time for contemplation. For you know, my dear, that the better part ought not to be neglected, out of mere faſhionableneſs. And then, again, if we ariſe early, we may call our family to orders, and not be diſturbed by company. And now, my dear, I hope you will take this diſcourſe kindly. Indeed I have not a ſingle thought, but that theſe things are agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:033734_0075_0FF8BFBAA18A8C40"/>
to you; yet I thought it was neceſſary, that I ſhould expreſs my mind to you on theſe ſubjects.</p>
            <p>Dear Sir, ſaid I, your diſcourſe is very agreeable, and I am glad you have opened your mind to me on thoſe ſubjects; and I wiſh you would often notice to me thoſe rules that are neceſſary for me to follow. And now, Sir, I wiſh to aſk you a queſtion or two, wanting to have your opinion on the ſubject. The firſt queſtion is, how ſhould a man and woman behave to each other, in company, after they are married? For I have often ſeen thoſe that are married uſe each other with great freedoms; and ſeem as if they could not ſay too much to the expenſe of each other; which ever looked ridiculous to me; and often made me think, it was beſt for one not to change their condition, if one could not do it without having all their fooliſh foibles expoſed to the world. For you know, Sir, there are many things which we do, and ſay, which we don't wiſh to have exhibited to public view. And the other queſtion is, how is it poſſible that any man ſhould be ſo abandoned, as to attempt the chaſtity of any of our ſex that are within the pale, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome encouragement from the perſon ſo attempted?</p>
            <p>As to the firſt queſtion, my dear, I think the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of thoſe who are ſo nearly connected, when in company, ought to be ſuch, as would induce the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to judge, that they were agreeable to each other. And when they diſcourſe with each other, it ought to be done with tenderneſs, and in as polite a manner, as you would addreſs any other perſon: but nothing bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering on an over-heated fondneſs; for a perſon can ſpeak kind and agreeable things to another; and ſhow that their companion has the preference, and that one is no ways diſſatisfied with their choice, without that fawning fondneſs that is ever diſguſtful to compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and is to be reprobated by all by-ſtanders: But, as you obſerved, there are thoſe, who ſpeak ſhocking things of their companions only to divert themſelves and company, not conſidering that the reſt of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany will think themſelves authoriſed to uſe the ſame freedoms. And again, they will many times expoſe
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:033734_0076_0FF8F17B119F46B8"/>
the foibles of each other, which ſhould be the care and endeavour of every thinking perſon to conceal. By which means they are expoſed to the contempt and ſcorn of all that come near them. And how can it otherways be, when thoſe that ought to extenuate the faults of each other, ſeem to try all in their power to exaggerate them, and to make their boſom friend look as ridiculous as poſſible.</p>
            <p>As to your other queſtion, I do not think there are many men that will attempt the chaſtity of a married woman, unleſs ſhe, by ſome word or action, gives him encouragement. And the greateſt thing that one can poſſibly improve upon, is the woman's ſpeaking ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly of her huſband; which the man ſo attempting, will immediately take advantage of, by joining with her againſt her huſband, and will ſoon make him appear to her a ſhocking picture of a man; and ſo will lead on, from one thing to another, 'till he has inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated himſelf into her favour, which many times will end in ruin. We ought therefore to ſpeak well of our companion before all company, that none may take advantage of our converſation. Great freedoms in converſation often emboldens the vicious to conſtrue ſuch freedoms as an encouragement. Therefore I think it beſt to be modeſt in our converſation; for that will tend to our own honour, as well as ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And now, my dear, I have given you my thoughts on theſe ſubjects, without the leaſt reſerve.</p>
            <p>It is very kind in you, Sir, ſaid I, and very ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to me, for you to diſcourſe on theſe topics.— And do, dear Sir, continue to inſtruct me, as occaſion ſhall offer.</p>
            <p>And ſo my dear aunt, we held our diſcourſe, till we arrived at Mr. Granbe's. When we arrived there, we were met at the door by Mr. Granbe, who conducted us into the parlour, where we were met by my dear Mrs. Sophia, who run to me, and we could not refrain from embracing each other. You may eaſily imagine the meeting was very agreeable to us; for we had not ſeen each other for the ſpace of two years. After the firſt emotion was over, we ſeated
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:033734_0077_0FF8F17E129C53F8"/>
ourſelves, and entered into converſation; and there was ſuch cheerfulneſs in each one's countenance, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with ſuch frankneſs of behaviour, and the converſation was conducted with ſuch politeneſs and eaſe, as made the interview very pleaſing to each one of us; and we ſpent the remainder of the day and evening, greatly to my ſatisfaction. For, as Mr. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford and Mr. Granbe are both of a ſerious turn of mind, their diſcourſe was beautified with ſome noble remarks on religion. My dear Mrs. Granbe thinks exceeding well of religion, ſo that their diſcourſe was truly ſatisfactory to both of us. I cannot forbear mentioning one remark that Mr. Granbe made on what I think is a great duty.</p>
            <p>It appeared ſtrange to him, he ſaid, that ſo many in this land, where we are favoured with a preached goſpel, ſhould deſignedly abſent themſelves from pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic worſhip, and debar themſelves from the benefit of the word of God; and, as it were, ſhut the door againſt all conviction; and thereby, in effect, ſay, "they care for none of theſe things." And thus, through this fatal neglect, the morals of thoſe unhappy perſons become corrupted, and they grow more and more vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious, until, perhaps, they grow quite abandoned, and are paſt all hopes of repentance. But the evil will not ſtop here; for his children will be apt to follow his example, and ſo it will be like a great river of death, that flows broader and deeper, till it ends in deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And I verily believe, continued he, that it would be to a man's advantage to attend conſtantly on public worſhip, if it were only to cultivate the morals of his children. And what, continued he, can be the reaſon, that ſo many in theſe days, are ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to profane language? Can there be any pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure in the uſe of ſuch language, or any ſatisfaction to be reaped therefrom? To me it is quite diſguſtful; and I cannot ſee what can induce any one to utter ſuch diſcourſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I would thank you Mr. Danford, continued he, to give us your mind on this ſubject.</p>
            <p>I ſhall be happy, ſaid Mr. Danford, to oblige you, by delivering my ſentiments on that ſubject: for I
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:033734_0078_0FF8F180E40D56F0"/>
think it is a moſt deteſtable practice. For in almoſt all other enormities that we run into, there ſeems to be ſome temptation to excite us thereunto: but profane language is a vice which ſeems to be without the leaſt temptation. For it does not promiſe either pleaſure, profit, or honour: but ever makes thoſe who uſe it, look contemptible! Indeed, it is quite a fooliſh prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and unmans any perſon who makes uſe of it.— I cannot imagine what inducement any perſon can have, for addicting themſelves to ſuch infernal language. But, perhaps, ſome may think, that wounding the ears of many with their profane words, will grace their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation in the opinion of others, and ſet them off in the eyes of the world, cauſing others to think they are full as important as they really are. But with good characters, they muſt, and will appear very little, and their words of no conſequence; becauſe thoſe that will ſwear needleſsly, will, generally, as needleſsly wrong the truth. And I make it a rule, to give but little credit to what ſuch perſons ſay: for a perſon that will lie, will ſwear to it, without the leaſt heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore, ſuch perſons are not to be believed a whit the more for their horrible aſſeverations. I have often wondered, that any perſon can be ſo aband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, as to imitate the father of lies, and prince of darkneſs, and uſe language which we ſuppoſe is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his language, only for the ſake of following a fooliſh practice, which, the moſt abandoned amongſt us, have brought into vogue, by the inſtigation of the above agent. Some are ſo vicious and void of good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, that they do not ſcruple to wound, with their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid expreſſions, the ears and tender feelings of the fair ſex, who, we muſt ſuppoſe, abhor to hear ſuch lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage made uſe of: for we cannot harbour a thought that ſuch diſcourſe is agreeable to them, much leſs, that any of that ſex will make uſe of it.</p>
            <p>The next day, as we were in converſation, Mr. Granbe deſired me to give them the hiſtory of my ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, which I accordingly did, with cheerfulneſs, and much to his ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="unknown:033734_0079_0FF8BFC153C02ED0"/>He then aſked me to give my opinion upon theſe queſtions, viz. How far ought a parent to ſhow reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their children, when they attempt to marry contrary to their liking? And, alſo, whether parents ought to uſe commands in that affair, or not. I have been, perhaps, Sir, ſaid I, too much in the ſmoke, to give you a clear and impartial account of the fire; and would beg you, Sir, to put that queſtion to Mr. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. And then turning to Mr. Danford, ſaid, will you, my dear, give Mr. Granbe an anſwer to this queſtion?</p>
            <p>If you requeſt it, ſaid Mr. Danford, I ſhall be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to give Mr. Granbe, and the reſt of the company, my thoughts on that ſubject. The reſt of the company ſaid, it would be very ſatisfactory to them, to hear his mind on it.</p>
            <p>I will proceed, then, ſaid Mr. Danford, by declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that, in my opinion, parents ought never to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their children, in point of marriage, againſt their inclination; nor uſe any roughneſs in the matter. But if parents ſee that a child, in their opinion, is in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being ruined in marriage, they ought, by all means, to give them their advice, and tell them of the fatal conſequences of their proceedings. But their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ought to be given, mixed with love, and the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt expreſſions they are capable of. For, how doth a parent know, but the child's inclination is too ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly biaſſed to admit of an alteration. Theſe are very tender points to meddle with; and the parent, by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the child againſt its liking, may ſhock the feelings, change the temper, and even diſorder the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the child. For commands are very ſtubborn things, and ought not to be uſed at all in this matter. And it is my opinion, that advice will go further to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards making a child break with a perſon they are attached to, than rough uſage: for a dutiful child will have a regard to the tender advice of an affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate parent; and if their inclinations are not too ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixed, will certainly adhere to ſuch advice, for it will then appear to be wholly deſigned for their good. But when any kind of roughneſs is uſed, the child will
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:033734_0080_0FF8F186852D8020"/>
be apt to ſay, what! am I not capable of making my own choice? and why may I not have one of my own chuſing, inſtead of being compelled to be joined to one who I cannot like? And then, what has the perſon that I have ſet my affections on done, that he muſt be ſlighted and abuſed? I am ſure he is not to blame, that I am partial in his favour: and as long as I have a regard for him, it is kind in him to regard me. And I think it very unjuſt, that he ſhould be perſecuted only becauſe he is agreeable to me. And thus the parents, by their rough treatment to their child, will arouſe the ſentiments of compaſſion and gratitude in favour of the perſon beloved, which will have a tendency to heighten their affections for each other.— "Stolen waters are ſweet;" and ſome have gone ſo far as to ſuppoſe, that our firſt parents would not have preferred the forbidden fruit, if there had been no prohibition on it. How very irkſome it is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the company of this, that, or any other perſon, againſt our wills and inclination? And to be confined to a perſon that is not agreeable to us, and that confinement to be for life, in the neareſt relation that can poſſibly ſubſiſt, is a very unhappy ſituation; and ought to engroſs the moſt ſerious conſideration of parents as well as children.</p>
            <p>Your ſentiments, ſaid Mr. Granbe, are exactly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to my mind. For, I think, that parents, in ſuch caſes, ought to do nothing but give their advice; and then let their children do as they pleaſe. For 'tis they that muſt abide the conſequence, and not the parents. And when they have given their advice, told the child what they think will be the conſequences of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and mentioned the particular failing of the perſons they are adviſing againſt, I think they have done their duty; and ſhould ſuffer the child to conſider of the matter, and refuſe, or accept the advice, as they think fit. When parents uſe their power and author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity in this point, it often has a contrary effect, from what they deſigned; and is ſcarcely ever productive of good; but many times will end in the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, and damage of the child; and ſometimes the conſequences prove fatal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="unknown:033734_0081_0FF8F18A07FD3E08"/>By this, my dear aunt, you may judge, that our viſit was very entertaining. And, as I have given you ſuch a lengthy account of our converſation, I ſhall ſay no more about this viſit.</p>
            <p>But I would ſay one word about my father's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, ſince our return to his houſe. Indeed, my dear aunt, he is one of the moſt exemplary men in theſe parts; for he is very exact in all the duties of relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and makes a virtuous life his aim and boaſt. He is exceeding fond of Mr. Danford, and is very laviſh in the praiſes of him, and his daughter Polly (as he always calls me) to all his acquaintances. And is often telling his friends, what Mr. Danford has done for him; and then condemns himſelf, for his conduct to us heretofore. But ſays, as we have forgiven him, he hopes to gain our affections entirely by his conduct to us; and that his endeavours ſhall not be wanting. But my papa need not be anxious on that ſcore; for, I am ſure, he has our love, and reſpect, and will ever have our beſt wiſhes. I feel myſelf entirely eaſy; and as contented as is poſſible for one to be in this world.</p>
            <p>Well, if I don't conclude, you will think I am going to write a packet, inſtead of a letter. Pleaſe to give my compliments to all friends; and love to your fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily. Dear aunt, aſſure yourſelf that I am your moſt affectionate niece,</p>

            <head>LETTER XXVII. From Mrs. <hi>POLLY DANFORD,</hi> to her Aunt <hi>FINTER.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Ever dear Aunt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I WILL ſend you another letter. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I ſhall treſpaſs on your patience. Yet, as it is to my ſecond mamma; and, as you ſay, you love to read my ſcribbles, I will write on without further apology.
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:033734_0082_0FF8BFC2DDF41F10"/>
Well, this letter ſhall give you ſome account of Mr. Stapleton and his lady; for we have paid him a viſit. Mr. Danford, who had been out, the other day, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, that he had been in company with Mr. Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, who had invited us to pay him a viſit. Have you, my dear, ſaid he to me, any inclination to accept of his invitation?</p>
            <p>If it is agreeable to you, Sir, ſaid I, I have no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections; and ſhall attend to your command at any time.</p>
            <p>He wiſhed to wait upon us, to-morrow, replied Mr. Danford, and I think we will go; for I have ſome inclination myſelf to ſee his lady; and, perhaps, it will be ſatisfactory to you to ſpend an hour or two with her. And I ſuppoſe you can diſcourſe with him now with more eaſe, than you could, when he uſed to viſit you.</p>
            <p>I don't know but I can, ſaid I. And, beſides, I promiſed him that I would reſpect him as my father's friend, if he would relinquiſh his pretenſions to me: and now if I pay him a viſit, I ſhall be as good as my word.</p>
            <p>Well, about ten o'clock the next day, we ſet out on our viſit; and as it is ſome diſtance to Mr. Stapleton's, we went in the coach.</p>
            <p>On our way thither, Mr. Danford told me, that we muſt not expect to ſee ſo polite a family as ſome; but, continued he, we muſt not let that diſconcert us; on the contrary let our behaviour be as eaſy, and our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation as cheerful, as if we were well pleaſed with their conduct.</p>
            <p>I hope, Sir, ſaid I, that I ſhall not be ſo abſurd as to trouble myſelf about their family oeconomy. Nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertheleſs, I am glad you mentioned it to me; for now, I ſhall keep it in mind, and, therefore, ſhall not be ſo likely to ſhow any ſurpriſe at their roughneſs. I have ſeen Mrs. Stapleton when ſhe was a maiden, and ſhe then appeared to be quite an odd perſon in her beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. Therefore muſt not expect to find any thing genteel or polite in them. Well, at length we arrived at their houſe and Mr. Danford knocked at the door.
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:033734_0083_0FF8F190B887BDA0"/>
Come in, ſaid Mrs. Stapleton; but did not come to the door. So in we bolted; and as the parlour door was open, we ſtept in; where Mrs. Stapleton was ſitting. She, without riſing to receive us, cried out, lard! here is Mr. Danford come!</p>
            <p>Mr. Danford then took my hand, and introduced me to her.</p>
            <p>Your ſervant, ma'am! ſaid ſhe; but you have catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me in my morning dreſs.</p>
            <p>We then ſeated ourſelves, without any further com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments. Is Mr. Stapleton at home, ma'am? ſaid Mr. Danford.</p>
            <p>No, ſaid ſhe, he is taking his morning ramble, I ſuppoſe. Why, Mr. Danford, theſe men are ſtrange creatures, when they once get married. And I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they are all alike, ha, ha, ha!</p>
            <p>He is doubtleſs on buſineſs, ſaid Mr. Danford: but you expect him ſoon, don't you, madam?</p>
            <p>Yes, Sir, ſaid ſhe. But I believe 'tis time I was dreſſed, and the room ſet in order. With that, ſhe got up for the firſt time, and went to the door, calling out, Nab! you jade! why don't you ſet this room in order? Becauſe, ma'am, ſaid ſhe, you did not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der me to do it. Come along, ſaid ſhe, and do as I bid you! And then away ſhe went up ſtairs to dreſs, and left us ſitting in the parlour alone.</p>
            <p>After a while Nab, as Mrs. Stapleton called her, came in; but ſeemed to be very uneaſy at what her miſtreſs had ſaid to her. For ſhe ſaid, the time ſhe had engaged to live with Mr. Stapleton was almoſt out, after which, ſhe would not live with them one hour. For, ſaid ſhe, when one does all in one's power to pleaſe; to have nothing but angry words for their pains, is very diſcouraging. And this very morning I offered to ſet this room in order, but ſhe would not let me; and now I muſt be called a jade, for not doing what ſhe would not allow me to do: and all this only to make me look ill before ſtrangers. I am not uſed to ſuch treatment; for I was never faulted in any fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily before, neither will I be faulted in this much longer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="unknown:033734_0084_0FF8F19313972EB8"/>After ſhe had put the room in order, ſhe went out; and though I did not care to make her any reply, yet Mr. Danford and I had a conſiderable diſcourſe on the ſubject. For we were left alone, and could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe as privily as if we were in our own chamber.</p>
            <p>What means do you think, my dear, ſaid he to me, are the beſt, to prevent theſe family feuds, which are ſo very troubleſome, where they are practiced?</p>
            <p>I think, Sir, ſaid I, that a family may be governed as well without ſuch a clamour, as with it. And for the moſt part, a kind word, and a pleaſant look will do more towards keeping up good order in a family, than hard words and angry looks. And then, for the head of a family to command, and then countermand their ſervants, and blame them for not doing what, perhaps, they never commanded them to do, is diſcouraging, and cannot fail of diſagreeable conſequences. And then, when there is a continual clamour kept up, the ſervants don't know when one is in earneſt, and when not; and ſo, by this means, one loſes all their author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity with their ſervants, and cannot expect any thing but feuds, and diſturbances in their family.</p>
            <p>After a while, Mr. Stapleton came home, and put on as graceful a face as poſſible, and was as polite as you ever ſaw him. When he entered the parlour where we were ſitting, he paid his compliments to Mr. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and then to me; which, being returned, and we having ſeated ourſelves, he ſaid, it gives me great ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction, to ſee two of my moſt worthy friends call upon me; and I am ſorry that I was not at home when you firſt came; but I was called away on buſineſs, and hope I may be excuſed.</p>
            <p>You are very excuſable, ſaid Mr. Danford, for it is often the caſe, that we are called from home, when we leaſt wiſh to be abſent.</p>
            <p>Now, in this place, my dear aunt, I will try to give you ſome ſort of a portrait of Mrs. Stapleton, and a ſketch of her character. She is of a dark complexion, with coarſe black hair, and black eyes; which, at the firſt ſight, ſhow a degree of brilliance; but it needs but
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:033734_0085_0FF8F195EF9A66C0"/>
a ſmall degree of phyſiognomy, to diſcover, that they are filled with malignant ſpite. She is full faced, and all her features rather coarſe; and being pretty tall and bulky, one would be led to think, that none could like her for her perſon. Well, now for her character. She is of a ludicrous turn of mind, and affects to be a wit; which leads her to be very loquacious; though for the moſt part, her prattle is without connexion or ſenſe. And this ſhe generally makes more contemptible, by letting up a large laugh at the end of every ſentence, which I think indicates brutality of manners. She is of a dictatorial temper, and therefore cannot bear to be contradicted; which makes it very difficult for one to diſcourſe with her, without offence; and indeed, I did not care to have much converſation with her.</p>
            <p>But to return; after a while Mrs. Stapleton came down ſtairs, dreſſed out to the beſt advantage; and ſeemed to be full of a ſenſe of her own importance. After ſeating herſelf, ſhe ſaid to Mr. Stapleton, I think you received your gueſts in a ſhocking manner this morning; for you told me, that you expected Mr. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford and his lady here, and then run away yourſelf; ſo as to be out of the way when they came.</p>
            <p>But buſineſs called me away, ma'am, ſaid he; and I was ſorry for it: but I think you might have been dreſſed before twelve, and not have left Mr. and Mrs. Danford ſitting here alone; which was very unpolite in you. And I had rather you ſhould not have been dreſſed to-day, than to have treated my friends in ſuch a manner. Perhaps, ſaid Mrs, Stapleton, you have been at the tavern, this morning; for I am ſure, that you have come home much more nice, than you was when you went away. And what if Mr. Danford did find me in my morning dreſs? Do you think it was the firſt time he ever ſaw a woman in a morning habit? I don't ſuppoſe that Mr. Danford is quite ſo nice as you are. But I believe, theſe men, the beſt of them, love to fault their wives, yet we can, for the moſt part, be up ſides with you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo there you have it! ha, ha, ha!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="unknown:033734_0086_0FF8F19DDFC9AA30"/>And ſo, my dear aunt, they ſported with each oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's characters, 'till they had expoſed all their foibles. I believe you may well think this was but a dull en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment to us. But to return.</p>
            <p>My dear, ſaid Mr. Stapleton, I believe 'tis time to drop this diſcourſe. Perhaps it is not agreeable to Mr. Danford and his lady.</p>
            <p>Well, ſaid ſhe, if they can't join with us, I ſuppoſe they can ſet and hear us. With that ſhe ſet up a horſe laugh again. After this, the converſation became general, and we diſcourſed on common topics till din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
            <p>After dinner, upon Mr. Stapleton and his wife's falling into the ſame thwarting, reproachful diſcourſe, Mr. Stapleton, addreſſing himſelf to Mr. Danford, ſaid, don't you and your lady never get into theſe fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh diſputes? Although I cannot approve of ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, yet I think Mrs. Stapleton and I are always at them.</p>
            <p>Neither can I approve of ſuch diſcourſe, ſaid Mr. Danford; for I think it is a very diſagreeable ſight, to ſee the two that are, or ought to be, but one, contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually at variance; even though it is in a jeſting way. And many times they begin in jeſt, and end in earneſt. Ah, ſaid Mr. Stapleton, that is often the caſe with Mrs. Stapleton and myſelf; for we often get by the ears; and after a little ſmarting on both ſides, we come to an ecclairciſſement, and then we jog on in the ſame path we did before.</p>
            <p>Well, ſaid Mrs. Stapleton, I don't care a fig about your refinements: neither do I like ſuch mighty polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs between a man and his wife. I love jeſting; and if we do diſagree at times, what then? After we have had a ſmart quarrel, we can have a ſweet making up; and then we love one another better than ever. And ſo I don't care whether either of you like it or not, as it is pleaſing to me. I ſuppoſe I have a right to chuſe my diſcourſe. What ſay you, Mrs. Danford, won't you join with us in this matter?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="89" facs="unknown:033734_0087_0FF8BFC58B5FBE40"/>I muſt beg leave to differ from you, ma'am, ſaid I, for I always look upon a man and his wife, to be but one. And I think there ought not to be any differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſubſiſting between them, on any account whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. And then, a woman ought ever to look upon her huſband as the head, and one that has a right to command; and ſhe ought to reverence him according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. At this, Mrs. Stapleton broke in upon me, ſaying, "Reverence to whom reverence is due;" but I think myſelf as much above the men, as you think yourſelf below them. And, "as one thinketh, ſo is he." And ſo there I have you, ha, ha, ha!</p>
            <p>And now, dear aunt, did you ever hear any thing like this? To turn every thing one ſays into ridicule in this manner? Indeed it quite provoked me, ſo I did not anſwer her again.</p>
            <p>After this we diſcourſed on common topics till it was time to return home. And glad was I, when we got into the coach again. After we had got a little from the houſe, Mr. Danford ſaid to me, well, my dear, how did you like your viſit? Did you get any inſtruction from Mr. and Mrs. Stapleton's diſcourſe? For we ought ever to improve by the conduct of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. It was not ſatisfactory to me in the leaſt, ſaid I. On the contrary, their jeſting, diſputing, and expoſing one another, appeared to me ridiculous, and diſguſtful, in the higheſt degree. But then, as to my improving by their conduct, I think I never made a viſit in my life that I might get more inſtruction from, than this: for what we ſee thus ſtrikingly amiſs in others, we ſhall be more apt to avoid ourſelves, and thus eſcape the rock they ſplit upon. May I never be left to conduct in a family as Mrs. Stapleton does! But what do you think of their conduct, Sir?</p>
            <p>I agree with you in ſentiments, upon that ſubject, ſaid he, but it is granted by all, that a man and his wife may uſe freedom of ſpeech to each other, when alone: But you know that I always made it a point with me, when in company, to uſe you with as much politeneſs, as I did any in the circle: and this I think
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:033734_0088_0FF8F19F8312A6D0"/>
ought always to be obſerved as a rule by married peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. But Mr. and Mrs. Stapleton bid fair to wear out a wretched life together, without peace or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment of mind; while, at the ſame time, their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the poſſeſſion of a conſiderable eſtate, ſeems on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to heighten their diſcontent and miſery.</p>
            <p>You ſee, my dear, by what Mrs. Stapleton ſaid to you about the reverence due to huſbands, that Mr. Stapleton has loſt all authority in his family, and that his wife places but little confidence in him; and when that is the caſe, you cannot expect much regularity in a family.</p>
            <p>But what could Mrs. Stapleton mean, ſaid I, when ſhe hinted to Mr. Stapleton, a ſuſpicion that he had been at the tavern? He does not practice drinking to exceſs, does he? Indeed, my dear, ſaid he, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it is too true to make a teſt of. But Mr. Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton did not practice this vice, when he was a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle man: but now having but little peace at home, and not having ſteadineſs of mind to govern his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, nor reſolution enough to guard againſt that vice, 'twill be well if he does not ruin his reputation. A man cannot follow that vice without an entire loſs of his character: for a man muſt appear in a moſt deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able light, that follows ſuch a beaſtly practice. And then, ſuch an one is not to be truſted in the diſcharge of any buſineſs, as we know not when we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon him.</p>
            <p>And ſo, my dear aunt, we diſcourſed, till we arrived at our own houſe.</p>
            <p>I will now conclude this long epiſtle, by ſubſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf your affectionate niece, or rather daughter,</p>

               <salute>My dear Aunt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>AS you engaged me to ſend you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of every thing worth notice, and as I love writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I will ſend you another letter; and this ſhall give you ſome account of my brother and ſiſter Murfee: for Mr. Danford, meeting with Mr. Murfee, had a long diſcourſe with him, who earneſtly deſired that we would pay him a viſit at his houſe. For he ſaid, that he wiſhed to diſcourſe with us when together. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which, Mr. Danford promiſed to wait upon him in a day or two.</p>
            <p>Well, the next day we went, and were received by them in a very polite and affectionate manner.— Mr. Murfee met us at the door, and received us with an open and cheerful countenance, and conducted us into his parlour, where Jenny was ready to receive us, who, on our entering the room, aroſe and ran to me, ſaying, it gives me inexpreſſible joy and ſatisfaction, to ſee you both at our houſe. After compliments were over, we ſeated ourſelves and converſed on common topics for ſome time. After which Mr. Murfee ſaid, I have earneſtly deſired ſuch an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity as now preſents, to expreſs my mind to you both, my brother and ſiſter; and I feel myſelf happy that you have condeſcended to viſit me: and hope now, that you will not hate and diſpiſe me, though I have acted a baſe and fooliſh part with Mr. Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, while you was abſent. For as you muſt have
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:033734_0090_0FF8F1AAAD6EBCC0"/>
felt the injury, I ſhall endeavour to make you repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:—I do therefore moſt ſincerely aſk forgiveneſs of you both; and hope, that after you have been made ſenſible how truly I repent of my behaviour to Mr. Granville, you will endeavour to look upon me in the ſame light, as if I had acted the part of a ſon to a parent. And if you can look upon me as a broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, do be ſo kind as to aſſure me of it. Dear Sir, ſaid Mr. Danford, you have done nothing againſt me; but I am glad you are ſenſible of your neglect, in not aſſiſting Mr. Granville in his ſtraits: but I dare ſay, that he waits for nothing but an opportunity to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give you. And I doubt not, now, but that you will ſoon give him that pleaſing ſatisfaction: for it is a pleaſure to him to forgive an injury.</p>
            <p>Well, ſiſter Polly, ſaid Mr. Murfee, can you look upon us the ſame as if none of theſe miſunderſtandings had taken place?</p>
            <p>Dear Sir, ſaid I, you need not have aſked me ſuch a queſtion, for I ſhall ever look on you as a brother; and I hope theſe miſunderſtandings will ſoon be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſed,</p>
            <p>I hope then, ſaid Mr. Murfee, that you will both aſſiſt me in bringing about this much deſired recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation.</p>
            <p>I will try all in my power, ſaid Mr. Danford, to get theſe differences reconciled.</p>
            <p>Theſe differences, ſaid Mr. Murfee, have been the cauſe of great anxiety of mind to me. But then, I believe they have been a great means of good to me, For many times, good comes out of evil: yet that is not a warrant for us to do wrong. For, believe me, Mr. Danford, though I uſed to think, there was noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in virtue or religion, but a mere name; yet I think quite otherwiſe now. And I flatter myſelf, that you will think the more favourable of me for this confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: ſeeing you are an advocate for virtue, and delight in it, and in thoſe who endeavour to practice it.</p>
            <p>I rejoice, ſaid Mr. Danford, that you are come over to the ſide of virtue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For "her ways are ways of
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:033734_0091_0FF8BFC819D59238"/>
pleaſantneſs, and all her paths are peace." And there is no compariſon between a life ſpent in the ways of virtue, and one waſted in vice. I dare ſay, this is highly pleaſing to Mrs. Murfee. And I cannot but rejoice with her; for I know, that virtue and religion were always her boaſt.</p>
            <p>Dear Sir, ſaid Jenny, no event of my life ever gave me the joy which this has done<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor ever did I know what it was to enjoy ſocial happineſs, till of late. And now, if my father was but reconciled to Mr. Murfee, I ſhould feel myſelf without a wiſh for any thing in this world.</p>
            <p>This, my dear aunt, was an agreeable relation to me, you may well think. To ſee Mrs. Murfee's counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſparkle with ſenſibility, and to ſee the cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her looks, and the pleaſure which ſeemed to pervade her mind; every word appearing to be ſpoken with a feeling ſenſe of the happy turn Mr. Murfee had taken, were ſcenes truly delightful, and ſweetened my viſit greatly. But to return; there was nothing elſe remarkable in our viſit, ſave that, when we ſet out for home, Mr. Danford invited Mr. and Mrs. Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee to return the viſit, and promiſed them to be an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate with my father, on their behalf. They thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and promiſed to wait on us ſoon.</p>
            <p>The next day Mr. Danford fell into diſcourſe with my father concerning Mr. Murfee; wherein he told him that Mr. Murfee was exceeding ſorry for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour to him, and earneſtly deſired his forgiveneſs. And really, continued Mr. Danford, Mr. Murfee is quite a different man from what he uſed to be: and I hope, Sir, you will forgive him, and receive him into favour again.</p>
            <p>If Mr. Murfee, ſaid my father, is ſorry for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour to me, and repents of his paſt miſconduct, and will aſk my forgiveneſs, I ſhall think it my duty to forgive him. And then Mr. Danford related to him what Mr. Murfee had ſaid on the ſubject, which gave him great ſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="unknown:033734_0092_0FF8F1AC8EC2A020"/>The next day, Mr. and Mrs. Murfee called upon us—Mr. Danford met them at the door, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted them into the parlour, where my father, mother, and myſelf were ſitting. We all aroſe to receive them, and after the uſual ſalutations on both ſides, Mr. Murfee accoſted my father as follows:</p>
            <p>Dear Sir, I moſt ſincerely beg your forgiveneſs: For I know I have acted the part of an undutiful ſon with you, by neglecting to aſſiſt you when in diſtreſs. And indeed, my conduct at that time was not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent: for to my ſhame, I now confeſs, that I had then no regard to virtue; but conſidered virtue and vice on a par: and did not trouble myſelf any further about thoſe nice diſtinctions (as I then called them) than juſt to keep up my reputation. But I hope, Sir, you will believe me, when I declare, that ſuch conduct as I then practiſed, now appears odious to me; and that I now love virtue for virtue's ſake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of Mr. Danford and my ſiſter Polly, convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, that there muſt be ſomething in virtue more than an empty name. And I think, I can now ſay, that virtue and religion appear amiable to me. And now, dear Sir, can you forgive me, and own me for one of our family again. I am glad, ſaid my father, that your eyes are opened; and that you have ſeen your error. And as you have aſked my forgiveneſs, I freely grant it you, and hope you will ſtand faſt in the ways of virtue: For as vice carries its puniſhment along with it, ſo virtue gives its reward, even whilſt we are in the practice of it.</p>
            <p>And thus, my dear aunt, they diſcourſed together, for ſome time; and this you may well think, was a happy period to my mother. Indeed, we all ſeemed to be highly pleaſed with this reconciliation; and, in particular, my ſiſter Jenny, who ſeemed to be all life, upon this occaſion. For you may remember, I once mentioned to you, that there ſeemed to be a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent concern in her countenance, ever ſince ſhe had been married. Though ſhe never ſpoke of it, yet one might plainly diſcern it in her face. But now ſhe has
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:033734_0093_0FF8BF61F43232A8"/>
that open cheerfulneſs in her looks, which ſhe uſed to have in her maiden ſtate. And indeed, ſhe ſeems to be thrown back to eighteen again. I am, indeed, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejoiced for Jenny. My heart uſed formerly to be grieved for her; for ſhe would not open her mind to any; but kept her troubles to herſelf; and tried to make herſelf as cheerful as poſſible. But now ſhe ſpeaks freely of it, and ſays her happineſs is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete; and that ſhe did not know, till of late, the ſweets of ſocial happineſs, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>P. S. I had forgot to mention, that Mr. Danford ſtill continues exceeding fond of me. Indeed, he ſeems to be more kind to, and tender of me, than ever. For, he ſays, that at this time, I need all the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he is capable of ſhowing. And accordingly he ever ſpeaks encouragingly to me; which I find to be a great ſupport. For I often get into a melancholy mood, and train of thinking; and when Mr. Danford finds me in ſuch a frame, he endeavours to cheer me, all in his power. And indeed, he is nobly calculated to ſoothe the diſtreſſed, and ſtrenghten the feeble mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But you will think I am going to write another letter.</p>

            <head>LETTER XXIX. From Mrs. <hi>DANFORD,</hi> to her Aunt <hi>FINTER.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Ever dear Aunt,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>MY firſt devoir I muſt pay to you. For never does a day paſs over me, without the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the happy time I ſpent in your family: which fills me with ſo grateful a ſenſe of the kindneſs you then ſhewed me, as will not be effaced ſo long as life endures. I have likewiſe to thank you for your kind letter; from which I received much pleaſure and benefit; eſpecially that part where you adviſed me not to give way to deſponding thoughts on my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, (you having diſcovered my ſituation from the poſtſcript of my laſt) but to "put my truſt in that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who is able to help in time of trouble." You like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe aſſured me of your prayers for my ſafety. Now let me inform you that I have paſt through the peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous hour; and have juſt got about again. Bleſſed be the great Diſpoſer of all events, who appeared for me in the hour of diſtreſs; and "hath filled my heart with rejoicing and my mouth with praiſe!" I am now the mother of a noble ſon; and our family have done nothing but rejoice, ever ſince this event. And in particular, my father ſeems to be ten years younger, than he was before.</p>
            <p>Mr. Danford, who ſeeks every opportunity to pleaſe my father, ſaid, as ſoon as our little ſon was carried to him—this is William Granville Danford. I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſaid, you might ſee the bloom of youth fluſh in my father's face, and with a complacent countenance and looks full of ſenſibility, he looked at Mr. Danford, and then at me, ſaying, with ecſtacy, how greatly do I rejoice in the birth of this child! He
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:033734_0095_0FF8F1B82C084338"/>
ſhall be my ſon, indeed he ſhall: for, as I have no ſon left, I ſhall look upon this as my own, and ſhall provide for him accordingly. And then, his being the ſon of my beloved Mr. Danford and Polly, heightens his value in my eſtimation, and will ſecure him my affections. And may he live to the age of man, and be a comfort to his parents, a ſupport to the declining age of his grand-parents, and a glory to the land he lives in!</p>
            <p>It gave Mr. Danford great ſatisfaction to find he had pleaſed my father ſo well. And, indeed, he is never better ſatisfied, than when he doth any thing that pleaſes him. I was likewiſe as well pleaſed myſelf. For I muſt confeſs, that the little dear looked charming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to me: For I fancy, that I can ſee all that intrepidity, mixed with gentleneſs, ſo conſpicuous in the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of my dear Mr. Danford. But I would not wiſh to praiſe the little lamb too much. For, are we not my dear aunt, apt to ſet too much by our children? We are apt to conſider them as our own; indulging the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation of what may be for many years to come: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſo very liable to be deprived of them. But then, it is our duty to love our children; and beſides; it is natural for us ſo to do.</p>
            <p>Mr. Danford is fonder of me than ever; and my father cannot keep out of the room where our child is: for his heart ſeems to be bound up in the little dear. He is alſo very tender of me; and my mother is highly ſatisfied with all our conduct. And indeed, we are a happy family: for all ſeem to be emulous to excel in virtue; and vie with each other in acts of duty and friendſhip. Nor have we any of thoſe bad ſervants, that many complain of; which, perhaps, is owing more to the wiſe management, and good examples of Mr. Danford, than to our good fortune in procuring them.</p>
            <p>The only earthly wiſh I can reaſonably indulge, is for the happineſs of ſeeing my other parents. For, you know, I always conſidered you and my uncle as parents; you having always acted the part of parents
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:033734_0096_0FF8F1B9D0126CF8"/>
towards me. Of this kindneſs, I hope I ſhall ever retain a grateful ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Pleaſe to preſent my love and reſpects to all friends; and aſſure yourſelf, that I am</p>

            <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
            <p>SUFFICE it now to ſay, that Mr. Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville and Mr. Danford live together, in the utmoſt har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, cultivating but one intereſt; Mr. Danford being chief actor in buſineſs, and is exceeding careful to aſk advice of Mr. Granville in all affairs of importance, by which he ſecures his confidence entirely. Mr. Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville doats on Mr. Danford greatly, ever ſpeaking well of him to all that comes within the circle of his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. And as Mr. Danford has obtained his confidence, Mr. Granville approves of all his proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; ſeeming to think it impoſſible for him to do a wrong thing.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Danford makes a polite and agreeable gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman; is kind, tender-hearted, pious, and, indeed every thing that is amiable. This emulates many to cultivate her friendſhip, which her mother ſees with pleaſure.</p>
            <p>As Mr. Murfee has become a ſober gentleman, and has gained a reconciliation with Mr. Granville, he and Mrs. Murfee often viſit him; and they now take great delight in the converſation of each other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="unknown:033734_0097_0FF8F1BEDDE71720"/>Indeed, the whole of Mr. Granville's family, and children, live in love and unity, delighting themſelves in virtue and religion; practiſing honeſty and punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality with all men; which gains them many friends. And there is a cheerfulneſs in their converſation which diſcovers their happineſs, and which is apparent in their countenances, therefore it is a great pleaſure to be in their company.</p>
