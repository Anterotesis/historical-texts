            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>At the distance of more than a thousand miles, I would not give a fig for his love. There he cruizes upon unknown oceans, from one quarter of the world to another; while the gout is cruizing through all my limbs.</p>

                     <p>Indeed, it is only for your sake he exposes himself to so many hardships. Perhaps he will now soon be back again. I look every morning how the wind blows; and, should he return with a rich cargo? Should he change our present poverty into opulence? Look only, dear father, this is in the power of a son to do; while the daughter must sit at home, and can do nothing but take care of her sick father.</p>

                     <p>Oh! that is more than if Robert should bring me the luxuries of both Indies. Good Liddy, when the gentle eye converses so tenderly with me; I cannot describe to you, how much it does me good. You will think often that your father slumbers, when I sit upon my chair with my eyes closed! No, Liddy, your father then prays for you.</p>

Who is it, that throws my unmerited bankruptcy in my teeth, with every scanty morsel that I eat? Who despises my good burgher's blood, and talks so big of her German ancestors? Who is it that suffers me to starve? Who talks our tenants out of their money, and squanders so idly the slender rents which the possession of these houses has still left me? Did you not hear how I petitioned last night for a pipe of tobacco, and a pot of porter? Samuel carried your mother to the play-house; and I was obliged to send my appetite to sleep.</p>

The richest people, sir, are in debt to the whole world—yet, <hi>passe pour cela,</hi> though this point be granted you, the one of most importance still remains unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided.—Or, perhaps you may reckon punctuality in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be likewise the proof of an illustrious descent?</p>

                     <p>Nothing of consequence—He speaks very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle: he chews betel: he has a great veneration for cows; and whenever our town herd is driven out, he receives them with the deepest marks of adoration: he bathes every day: and at the entrance of every new and full moon, he distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes alms to the poor.</p>

                     <p>Were I but once his son-in-law, the mist of these foolish fancies should soon give place to the sun of reason. I will soon prove to him that a cow has no more claim to his veneration than an ass: I will prove to him, that neither at new nor full moon, neither in the first nor last quarter, is it permitted by prudence to give alms. In short, if the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase of Rogers-hall be clear, then will my marriage with Gurli be clear also. Farewel, in the mean time, my dear Oificer. Be indefatigable, zealous and active: but above all things be cautious: keep your five senses at all times upon the watch. My grateful disposition is well known to you; and if ever the question should be, Whether I would return your services with pleasure? then would the answer be always, Yes.

Yes, Sir, they are of her making. Look at them only: are they not handsome? Buy them! Cheap, very cheap; only three crowns; and if you will not betray me, then you shall know that the pretty young lady wrought five nights upon them.</p>

This is decisive. Such a heart must command happiness: were she even not beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, filial love would lend her celestial charms. At present she is poor; and yet she grudges not to labour five whole nights for her father. I am determined.</p>

Yes, Sir, a boy. to whom I had given a small commission. I thought a minute ago, that I saw him come into the house here: I must however have been mistaken.

There was a boy here; but most probably not the one that Miss Liddy expected. Look, Miss, I have just now bought a pair of ruffles. We men, are commonly cheated in such commodities. What think you of them?</p>

                     <p>Yes, Miss, they are worth crowns to any one who had them to place upon the head of that excellent young woman.

who I am. Not a heart in England has yet participated with me in the secret of my rank and sufferings. I was born on the banks of the Ganges, and in the bosom of feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; brought up by my uncle the sovereign of Mysore, a man of honor, whose throne and whose enemies I fell heir to. I was then scarcely sixteen years of age. They gave me wives, because custom would have it so: and by the time I was twenty, I saw myself already the father of five sons and a daughter. I was happy, for I was beloved by my people, and esteemed both by the French and English; and dreaded by all my enemies and neighbours; peace reigned in my kingdom and in my palace. I was happy then—thanks be to Providence. Man is ever blind to fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity. That I was cherishing serpents in my bosom; that my own brothers were conspiring against my crown and my life; and scattering the seeds of rebellion among my sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, was never once suspected by my credulous heart. At last the conspiracy broke out; the sceptre of Mysore was torn in one unhappy night from my hand; and also, my wives and my sons became the prey of the sanguinary victor. Only I with my daughter, and an old faithful servant, were so fortunate, after a thousand dangers, to reach at last the sea-coast. There lay two English ships just ready to set sail; one of which received us, weighed anchor, and brought us to Liddy's native land. If Liddy will restore to me what I have lost, then shall this be the last sigh which I will ever send after the happiness that is gone.</p>

                     <p>Dear Liddy, do not judge of me by the maxims of Europe. My wives were only my slaves, whom I could turn off whenever I had a mind. But even, upon the sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position that I loved them as well—as—I love you—what would my love and fidelity avail them, at the distance of so many thousand miles?—To me, my native country is lost for ever: I shall never again wander in the fertile fields of India.</p>

                     <p>If you should ever leave England, you might again marry some other girl, under the pretence that your love and fidelity could be no longer of advantage to me.</p>

remain in England, is my serious, unalterable intention.— All that I was able, at that unlucky moment, to save out of my royal treasures, were my diamonds—only baubles to a prince; but a considerable treasure to a private man.

                     <p>Set your mind at ease upon that subject: my daughter will still have a considerable fortune.

In such a charming place as Roger's-hall; by the side of your husband, who, if he cannot look for your love, may at least reckon upon your friendship and attachment; by the side of my good, lively Gurli;
<stage>[Casting down his eyes.]</stage>
in the circle of your children; and what you will perhaps value more than all, in the arms of your old father, whom I will take care of; whose latter days you will have the pleasure of sweetening; and who will renew his age at the sight of our happiness.—

Laugh as you please; I have only one ques<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ask: can such matters be too prudently managed? answer: no.

                     <p>But Gurli is a very poor relater; she neither knows how to begin, nor how to end.—My father was Nabob of Mysore: he was just and good: they called him the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of justice; for he punished the Derdar, as much as the water-bearer;—with him there was no respect of casts
<stage>[Weeping.]</stage>
and yet they have driven him from his native country; and murdered his wives and his children, and me they have suffered to live.</p>

                     <speaker>Liddy.</speaker>
                     <p>Who drove him out, and for what reason?</p>

                     <speaker>Gurli.</speaker>
                     <p>See, my father has two brothers, a couple of odious ugly men.—Ha, ha, ha! the one squints, and has a nose so long—and the other a head like a hollowed Kurbis, into which our Jugglers put their snakes—ha, ha, ha! well, his head was full of snakes too. The wicked man!—Liddy, there are sad wicked men in the world.
<stage>[Clenching her fist, and stamping with her foot.]</stage>
If I had him here, I would fix these nails firmly enough in his bristly locks.—He wished also to be Nabob of Mysore; and the other with the long nose too. Well, they plotted a sad villainy together, and got all the Nairs upon their side, and in one night they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked our house. Ah! dear Liddy, what a fright; and a shrieking, and a wailing, and a terrible alarm. Ah! I shud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der still when I think of that night. I sprung out of bed, and was quite out of my wits—Ha, ha, ha! my gold neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace I tied about my arm, and wrapt my apron about my head.
<stage>[Weeping.]</stage>
My poor father was obliged to fly through thick and thin in the dark night, and Gurli fled with him.
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:037748_0049_100EFF0B91492FA8"/>
Gurli sat in a palanquin; old Musaffery assisted to carry it;
<stage>[Laughing.]</stage>
and because it was a labour he had not been used to, he was falling every moment into the mire. At length we came to the sea shore. My father was calm and gloomy, and spoke not a word.
<stage>[Weeping]</stage>
Gurli wept sadly for her poor mother, and for her poor brothers and sis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. We went on board an English ship; the Captain was a foolish merry fellow;
<stage>[Laughing.]</stage>
he made Gurli laugh very much. We sailed many days through ihe sea, and many weeks after one another; at last Gurli began to tire; and at last, and at last we came hither.—Now I have told you all.</p>

                     <p>Thank you Sir. We weighed anchor in fine wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a fair south south east wind. It shifted about once or twice, and yet (praised be God for it) we never got out of deep water.</p>

                     <speaker>Jack.</speaker>
                     <p>So I think; a fine cargo! We might easily have made five thoasand pounds of it, but I'll be damn'd if there is a shilling of it in our pockets.</p>

                     <p>Answer: a great deal: Miss Gurli felt that she stood in need of a prudent companion, who weighed his words, and measured his steps, along the slippery path of this life. Her rational, laudable, and unexceptionable choice fell upon me; and now, the only question that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains is, whether Gurli's father has any objection to make to our union?

                     <p>But a wife is as little to be trusted as the most dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous whirlpool upon the sea.

And then, only think, Sir; you now manage your own vessel as you please; you weigh anchor whenever you have a mind; you steer whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thersoever you chuse; do you think, when you have taken a wife aboard, that your cable will be as long, and as free, as it has hitherto been?</p>

Do you recollect the poor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro, as we were once walking together in Jamaica? He was at work upon a sugar plantation; the sweat ran down his forehead; a pitcher of water stood by him, and yet he sang cheerily a Moorish song. My good friend, said you to him, this is a hard piece of work. That it is, gave he for answer, and wiped off the sweat with the palm of his hand. One question produced another. We asked him, how he was able to smile so contentedly at his hard fortune? He then pointed to a thicket a few paces off; under the thicket sat a black woman, with three little, half naked children, the youngest of whom was upon her breast. And while the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro was pointing with his finger, he looked so delighted with
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:037748_0082_100EFF530E1FAD48"/>
himself—no—such another smile never adorned the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of a king. Ah! if Liddy had but been willing, Fazir would have laboured like that slave—and smiled like him.</p>

A foreign vessel had just sailed, and was scarcely a canon-shot from the shore. Ah! thought I, had I only ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived an hour sooner, this ship would have taken me up, and at once delivered me from all danger. I hastily untied my turban, and made the muslin flutter in the air, and beckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and cried as loud as I could, but in vain: the ship sailed away with a fresh wind. I was almost in despair; and hunger drove me along the untrodden path, where I had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto

wandered, down to the shore.

                     <p>Hark you, dear youth, this is a matter which Liddy herself can alone determine.—You indeed are scarce twenty; and the freshness of youth blooms upon your cheek. I, on the other hand, carry the burden of five and thirty years upon my back.—However, so far as I know Liddy,

this will scarcely influence her decision. Let us see, we will call her. If her heart declares in your favor, I will then cheerfully submit to my fate.</p>
