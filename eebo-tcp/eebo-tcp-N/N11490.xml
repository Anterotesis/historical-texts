            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THE following Elegy was first published in one of the Boston Gazettes, about the middle of last September. It was adapted to the circumstances of the times at that period, and calculated to promote that Spirit of Liberty, Industry and Oeconomy, recommended by the Grand Congress, then sitting at Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. Notwithstanding some alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in the state of our public af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, by which the sentiments and advice in some parts of it are become superfluous, its general tenor, which no change in our fortune can render improper, and its poetical merit, made it worthy, in our opinion, of a second publication.</hi>

               <l>OH BOSTON! late with ev'ry pleasure crown'd,</l>
               <l>Where Commerce triumph'd on the fav'ring gales,</l>
               <l>And each pleas'd eye, that rov'd in prospect round,</l>
               <l>Hail'd thy bright spires and bless'd thy op'ning sails!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thy plenteous marts with rich profusion smil'd;</l>
               <l>The gay throng crouded in thy spacious streets;</l>
               <l>From either <hi>Ind</hi> thy chearful stores were fill'd;</l>
               <l>Thy ports were gladden'd with unnumber'd fleets.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>For there more fair than in their native vales,</l>
               <l>Tall groves of masts arose in beauteous pride;</l>
               <l>The waves were whiten'd by the swelling sails,</l>
               <l>And plenty wafted on the neighb'ring tide.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Alas, how chang'd! the swelling sails no more</l>
               <l>Catch the fair winds and wanton in the sky;</l>
               <l>But hostile beaks affright the guarded shore,</l>
               <l>And pointed thunders all access deny.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Where the bold Cape its warning forehead rears,</l>
               <l>Where tyrant Vengeance waved her magic wand,</l>
               <l>Far from the sight each friendly vessel veers,</l>
               <l>Calls the kind gales and flies the fatal strand.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The ruin'd Merchant turns his mournful eyes</l>
               <l>From the drear shore and desolated way;</l>
               <l>Thy silent marts unusual glooms surprize,</l>
               <l>And through thy streets the sons of rapine stray.</l>

               <l>Such the dread stillness of the desart night,</l>
               <l>When brooding horror settles on the groves;</l>
               <l>While pow'rs of darkness claim their hateful right,</l>
               <l>And fierce for prey the savage tyger roves.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Along thy fields, which late in beauty shone</l>
               <l>With lowing herds and grassy vesture fair,</l>
               <l>Th' insulting tents of barb'rous troops are strown,</l>
               <l>And bloody standards stain the peaceful air.—</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Are these thy deeds, oh Britain? this the praise,</l>
               <l>That points the growing lustre of thy name?</l>
               <l>These glorious works that in thy latter days,</l>
               <l>Gild the bright period of thine early fame?</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Shall thy strong fleets, with awful sails unfurl'd,</l>
               <l>On Freedom's shrines th' unhallow'd vengeance bend?</l>
               <l>And leave forlorn the desolated world,</l>
               <l>Crush'd—ev'ry foe, and ruin'd—ev'ry friend!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And damp'd alas! thy soul-inspiring ray,</l>
               <l>Where Virtue prompted and where Genius soar'd,</l>
               <l>Or quench'd in darkness, and the gloomy sway</l>
               <l>Of Senates venal and the liv'ried Lord!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>There shame sits blazon'd on th' unmeaning brow,</l>
               <l>And o'er the scene thy factious Nobles wait,</l>
               <l>Prompt the mixt tumult of the noisy show,</l>
               <l>Guide the blind vote and rule the mock debate.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>With fearful hands the fond complaint, to raise,</l>
               <l>Lift fruitless off'rings to the ear of Scorn—</l>
               <l>Of servile vows and well-dissembled praise!</l>

               <l>Will the deaf gods, that frown in molten gold,</l>
               <l>Bless the dup'd hand, that spreads the prostrate prayer?</l>

               <l>We rear'd our suppliant eyes with filial awe;</l>
               <l>While loud Disdain with ruffian voice reply'd,</l>

               <l>And ages blest of undisturb'd renown,</l>

               <l>Where stormy Neptune rolls his utmost tide,</l>
               <l>Where suns oblique diffuse a feeble ray,</l>
               <l>And lonely waves the fated coasts divide;</l>

               <l>Where matted thorns oppress the cultur'd fields,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>From those lov'd seats, the Virtues sad withdrew,</l>
               <l>From fell Corruption's bold and venal hand;</l>
               <l>Reluctant Freedom wav'd her last adieu,</l>
               <l>And Devastation swept the vassal'd land.</l>

On her white cliffs, the pillars once of fame,</l>
               <l>Her melancholy Genius sits to wail;</l>
               <l>Drops the fond tear, and o'er her latest shame,</l>
               <l>Bids dark Oblivion draw her sable veil.</l>
