            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

GRACE! <hi>It is even ſo, Lord, becauſe it Pleaſes thee</hi>!</p>
            <p>Indeed, the Whole CHURCH of GOD, collectively taken, is a TEMPLE, which our <hi>Magnificent Solomon</hi> is Building for Him. The <hi>Building</hi> is not yet Finiſhed. The Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod which anſwers to the <hi>Seventh Year,</hi> wherein the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Solomon</hi> was finiſhed, is not yet arrived.

In the mean time, we are told; <hi>All the Building fitly framed together, groweth unto an Holy Temple in the Lord.</hi> The <hi>Temple</hi> is <hi>Growing,</hi> in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Sinners unto GOD; and the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the Church daily of thoſe that ſhall be Saved.</hi> When a Sinner is Converted, a New <hi>Stone</hi> is brought and laid in the <hi>Building</hi> of the <hi>Temple.</hi> The <hi>Temple</hi> grows bigger and higher, as often as any Sinner is Converted.

What a <hi>Shout</hi> will be given upon that Stroke, <hi>It is Finiſhed! It is Finiſhed</hi>! Until this be done, this is the Reaſon why we are ſo earneſt with our Hearers, to Repent of <hi>Sin,</hi> and Return to

            <p>Muſt the <hi>Materials</hi> of an <hi>Houſe,</hi> be well <hi>Joyned</hi> unto One another? It will never be an <hi>Houſe,</hi> if they be not ſo. The <hi>Form</hi> of it, ariſes from the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of the <hi>Materials.</hi> In the <hi>Church</hi> there is a <hi>Conjunction</hi> of thoſe, of whom it is made up. Their <hi>Conjunction</hi> is by a <hi>Covenant</hi> of God. In ſome ſort or other, they do Reſolve and Engage together to Serve the Lord. We read; Pſal. 122 3. <hi>It is compact together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is the <hi>End</hi> of an <hi>Houſe</hi>? 'Tis to <hi>Dwell</hi> in; 'Tis a <hi>Dwelling-place.</hi> A <hi>Church</hi> is the Lords <hi>Dwelling-place.</hi> 'Tis an <hi>Habitation of God.</hi> We read, Rev 2 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>He walks there.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Finally; In an <hi>Houſe</hi> there are various <hi>Veſſels</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tinſels</hi> And in a <hi>Church</hi> there are ſo too. We read, 2 Tim 2 20. <hi>In a great Houſe, there are not only Veſſels of Gold and of Silver, but alſo of Wood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of Earth; and ſome to Honour, ſome to Diſhonour.</hi> Godly and Sincere Perſons in a <hi>Church,</hi> theſe are <hi>Veſſels of Honour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Golden Veſſels</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But, if a <hi>Church</hi> be an <hi>Houſe</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I Suppoſe it will put us in mind. That <hi>Church Work</hi> is
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001408_0009_0FB2FB32E73CAD80"/>
               <hi>Building-Work.</hi> I do not wonder then, that <hi>Church-Work</hi> does go on with <hi>Difficulty</hi>; Or, that it goes on with <hi>Deliberation</hi>; Or, that it is <hi>Expenſive</hi> to carry it on. To <hi>Build</hi> ſuch an <hi>Houſe,</hi> muſt needs be an <hi>Hard</hi> Work, a <hi>Slow</hi> Work, and a <hi>Coſtly</hi> One.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> But what kind of an <hi>Houſe,</hi> is a <hi>Church</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST? It is an <hi>Houſe</hi> that may be called, A <hi>Temple.</hi> Do but ſay, Who's <hi>Houſe</hi> it is, and you preſently deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it, <hi>A Temple.</hi> It is an <hi>Houſe</hi> of GOD. Hence we read; 2 Cor. 6 16. <hi>Ye are the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Living GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In affirming a <hi>Church</hi> to be a TEMPLE, there are Two very Important Things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd concerning a <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is to be Remembred, That a <hi>Church,</hi> is like a <hi>Temple, <hi>Dedicated</hi>
               </hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated</hi> unto the <hi>Special Service</hi> of GOD. What is a <hi>Temple</hi>? 'Tis an <hi>Houſe Dedicated</hi> unto the Worſhip of GOD. What is a CHURCH? 'Tis a Company of Men, who have <hi>Dedicated themſelves</hi> unto the Worſhip of GOD. GOD &amp; the Lord JESUS CHRIST, is Worſhipped in the <hi>Church.</hi> The very <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign</hi> upon which a <hi>Church</hi> is Erected, is, That the Lord might be Worſhipped there. A CHURCH is, as we read, 1 Cor. 1 2. <hi>To call upon the Name of JES<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S CHRIST<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our Lord.</hi> The Lord JESUS CHRIST affords unto men in His Church, peculiar Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001408_0010_0FB2FB34790CC838"/>
of Communion with Himſelf. A <hi>Church</hi> is gathered upon this Intention; That Men may therein Enjoy a <hi>Special Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion</hi> with GOD, and the Lord JESUS CHRIST. The Language, the Pretence, the very <hi>Motto</hi> of a <hi>Church</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is that; 1 Joh. 1.3. <hi>Truly our Fellowſhip is with the Father, and with His Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> In a <hi>Church,</hi> the Children of Men preſent their <hi>Offerings</hi> unto GOD; and in a <hi>Church,</hi> GOD Viſits the Children of Men, with <hi>Communications</hi> of Light and Life and Grace unto them. A <hi>Temple</hi> is made for this Purpoſe; That there may be upon <hi>Earth,</hi> in the Devotions of Men, Some <hi>Conformity</hi> to what is doing in <hi>Heaven</hi>; And that here may be a fit <hi>Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle,</hi> to take in Such <hi>Communications</hi> from <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> as God will favour Men upon <hi>Earth</hi> withal. This, This is the very purpoſe of a <hi>Church,</hi> 'Tis made, that <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> may therein come ſweetly together; 'Tis made, that <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> may therein Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with one another.</p>
            <p>Secondly. It is to be Remembred, That a <hi>Church</hi> is to take its meaſures, in many Things, from the <hi>Temple,</hi> which the Lord had of old, in the Land of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> There was a <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> built for the Special Service of GOD, according to a <hi>Pattern which God had ſhown him,</hi> of what is Exiſting, and Managed, in the <hi>Heavenly World</hi> There was a <hi>Second Edition</hi> of the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> in an Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001408_0011_0FB2FB36DF74FA80"/>
               <hi>Temple,</hi> built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> for the Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Service of GOD, according to the <hi>Further Directions,</hi> which the Viſions of God, had given unto his Father <hi>David</hi>; who had a clearer view than <hi>Moſes</hi> had, of particularly, the <hi>Throne of Glory,</hi> in the <hi>Third Heaven,</hi> or that Apartment of the <hi>Heavenly World,</hi> which was anſwered, by, <hi>The Holy of Holies,</hi> in the <hi>Temple.</hi> The Dying Servant of God, left that charge; 1 Chron. 22.19. <hi>Now ſet your Heart and your Soul, to Seek the Lord your God; Ariſe therefore, and Build ye the Sanctuary of the Lord.</hi> This <hi>Temple</hi> of GOD, is now laid in Aſhes. GOD has fulfill'd unto the Jews, His Threatning; <hi>Your Houſe ſhall be Left unto you Deſolate.</hi> The Jews are making that bitter complaint; <hi>Our Holy and our Beauteous Houſe, where our Fathers Praiſed thee, is burnt up with Fire.</hi> But the <hi>Temple</hi> was built on a Spot of Land, bought of a <hi>Gentile</hi>! GOD has many a <hi>Temple</hi> now in the Land of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Every CHURCH of the Lord JESUS CHRIST, is now to be a <hi>Temple</hi> of GOD. It is remarkable, That all the <hi>Furniture</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> Seen by <hi>John,</hi> in the <hi>Heavenly World,</hi> is introduced, as <hi>Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> The very <hi>Lamps,</hi> are <hi>Spirits</hi>; The very <hi>Horns</hi> of the <hi>Altar</hi> have a <hi>Voice</hi>; The <hi>Throne</hi> it ſelf <hi>Speaks.</hi> A <hi>Church</hi> is more like the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> in the <hi>Heavenly World,</hi> than any <hi>Inanimate Compoſition</hi> that has been called a <hi>Temple.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Living,</hi> every part of it. But that it may have the more of a <hi>Temple</hi> in it, what was in
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001408_0012_0FB2FB3841C91F70"/>
the <hi>Temple</hi> of old, muſt be <hi>Imitated</hi> and <hi>Spiritualized</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of the LORD. A <hi>Church</hi> is to conſider, what was to be <hi>Seen,</hi> and what was to be <hi>Done,</hi> in the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> and to take its Meaſures accordingly. I fore-ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That I muſt anon Reſume this Admonition.</p>
            <p>But if a <hi>Church</hi> be a <hi>Temple,</hi> Methinks All that are in the <hi>Church</hi> are hence Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed. <hi>Holineſs becomes this Houſe for ever!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It becomes them, to take up this Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<q>Well; I am in an <hi>Holy Place</hi>: I am where the <hi>Holy God</hi> is preſent, with Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Diſcoveries of Himſelf. Oh! Let me be very <hi>Holy.</hi> In ſuch an <hi>Holy Place,</hi> Let me do nothing Offenſive unto the Lord, who is <hi>greatly to be feared in the Aſſembly of the Holy Ones, and to be had in Reverence of all them that are about Him.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III.</hi> But what <hi>Regard</hi> ſhould the <hi>Parts</hi> of a <hi>Church</hi> have to one another? They ſhould ly well <hi>Together,</hi> that they may be a <hi>Temple</hi> of GOD. A <hi>Church</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST muſt have this property, <hi>Built together.</hi> It cannot pretend unto the <hi>Conſiſtency</hi> of a TEMPLE, if it be not ſo.</p>
            <p>Firſt. By a <hi>Church-Covenant,</hi> the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Parts</hi> of a <hi>Church</hi> are to be Brought and Laid well <hi>Together.</hi> While men ly <hi>Scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered</hi> one from another, and are not come
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001408_0013_0FB2FB39E0932068"/>
               <hi>Voluntarily <hi>together</hi>,</hi> and are not come into a <hi>Voluntary Relation</hi> unto each other, they cannot be a <hi>Church</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST. And how can they do this, but by a <hi>Mutual Confaederation</hi>? The Formation of a <hi>Church,</hi> is by a <hi>Church-Covenant,</hi> wherein men bind themſelves to Walk toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, according to the <hi>Order of the Goſpel.</hi> 'Tis a Sacred <hi>Corporation.</hi> Every <hi>Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is made ſo by a <hi>Covenant.</hi> It muſt be by a <hi>Covenant,</hi> that men are <hi>Incorporated</hi> into an Evangelical <hi>Church-State</hi> before the Lord. Tho' the Hazard of having the <hi>Word</hi> miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtrued among Malignant Enemies, might make the Apoſtles forbear uſing the Word, <hi>Covenant,</hi> yet we find the Thing in the Apoſtolical Writings. We read; Act. 5.13. about, <hi>Joyning</hi> to the Church. The Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word, carries this in it; A <hi>Cleaving to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether</hi>; which implies, Their <hi>Mutual Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> to <hi>Keep together</hi>: A <hi>Joyning</hi> in that <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> or <hi>Agreement,</hi> in which that Church <hi>Aſſociated</hi> for the Worſhip of the Lord. The Word is the ſame that is uſed for the <hi>Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-Covenant.</hi> A <hi>Church</hi> is a <hi>Spouſe</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>; It is by a <hi>Covenant</hi> that they approach unto Him. Brethren, This is the Day of your <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpouſal</hi> unto the Lord. Where men do not <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly</hi> at leaſt, <hi>Agree</hi> and <hi>Engage, <hi>together</hi>,</hi> to Worſhip the Lord JESUS CHRIST accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to His Laws, 'tis almoſt on all hands Agreed, they neither are, nor can be, <hi>A Church.</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:001408_0014_0FB2FB3D5F18D4A8"/>
All Reaſonable men, will grant as much as this comes to. An <hi>Implicit Covenant</hi> is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the very Being of a <hi>Church.</hi> And indeed, the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of a <hi>Church</hi> is preſerved, where there is but an <hi>Implicit Agreement</hi> of a Company of Believers, declared by their <hi>conſtant Practice,</hi> in <hi>coming Together</hi> for the Publick Worſhip of God, and <hi>Subjection</hi> to His Ordinances. But then, an <hi>Explicit Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> is Expedient, is Profitable, is Deſirea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Yea, 'Tis a <hi>Duty.</hi> Our GOD muſt be Served with <hi>Our Best.</hi> We muſt not <hi>Put off</hi> the Lord with a <hi>Defective Thing,</hi> when we have a <hi>Better.</hi> And we are certain, That an <hi>Explicit Covenant</hi> is <hi>better</hi> than an <hi>Implicit.</hi> The <hi>Officers</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> are choſen by the <hi>Church,</hi> and come in with the <hi>Conſent</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> As there muſt be a <hi>Covenant</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Church</hi> and its <hi>Officers</hi>; thus there muſt be a <hi>Covenant</hi> in the <hi>Church,</hi> to Qualify, to Diſtinguiſh, to Enable them, that they may <hi>Chuſe</hi> their <hi>Officers.</hi> Accordingly, Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical and Unqueſtionable Hiſtory Reports to us, <hi>A Covenant,</hi> which the <hi>Primitive Chriſtians</hi> had among them. <hi>Tertullian</hi> thus deſcribes a <hi>Church, <hi>Corpus Sumus, de Spei Faedere</hi>,</hi> as <hi>Incorporated</hi> with a <hi>Covenant. <hi>Pliny</hi>
               </hi> relates, That Some <hi>Renegado</hi> Chriſtians being Examined by him, Confeſſed, They had a <hi>Covenant</hi> among them. <hi>Justin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr</hi> Speaks of <hi>Three Things,</hi> then demanded of all that were Admitted into the Church; A

               <hi>New Birth</hi>; A <hi>Sound Faith</hi>; and, A <hi>Promiſe</hi> to walk in Obedience to the Goſpel. <hi>Zep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> tells us, of many <hi>Reformed</hi> Churches in theſe Later Ages Reviving this Diſcipline of the <hi>Primitive</hi>; That they who were Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto the <hi>Lords-Supper</hi> in them, Solemnly Entred into a <hi>Covenant,</hi> That by the Grace of God they <hi>would Order their Lives according to His Word, and Submit unto the Diſcipline of His Church. Parker</hi> ſayes; <hi>Admittitur, non Sine Solenni Pactione, cum Deo, et cum Eccleſiâ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the <hi>Church-Covenant,</hi> is meant, The <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> applied unto thoſe <hi>Duties</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> which a <hi>Church</hi> of the Lord is to Obſerve, that the <hi>Order of the Goſpel</hi> may be maintained in it. There are <hi>Particular Duties,</hi> which the <hi>Members</hi> (the <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Brethren</hi>) of <hi>Particular Churches,</hi> owe to one another. They that will not Seriouſly, and Solemnly <hi>Acknowledge</hi> their Obligations to the <hi>Duties,</hi> are but poorly Qualified to be Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged as <hi>Members</hi> of the <hi>Churches.</hi> Now the <hi>Church-Covenant</hi> in our <hi>Churches,</hi> is nothing elſe, but that <hi>Acknowledgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some <hi>Diſaffected</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nacquainted</hi> Perſons, may decry the <hi>Covenant</hi> by which our <hi>Churches</hi> are formed, as a <hi>Singularity.</hi> But even in this Day of Deviation from the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Diſcipline,</hi> the Lord ever now and then raiſes up, ſome <hi>Teſtimony</hi> for it. I will at this time only Recite the Words, of Mr. <hi>Oſtervaldt,</hi>

            <p>
               <q>The <hi>Order</hi> which I mean, is this, Firſt, That when Perſons deſire to be Admitted unto the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> they ſhould be Inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for Some Weeks before, and that the ſame time, they ſhould be informed of the Sacredneſs and Importance of the Action, and of the <hi>Promiſe</hi> they are to make, that ſo they may prepare for it betimes. In the next place, that they ſhould be <hi>Examined,</hi> and that they ſhould Publickly render an Account of their <hi>Faith.</hi> This Examination, being over, that they ſhould be required, to Renew and Confirm in a Publick and Solemn manner, their <hi>Baptiſmal Vow,</hi> to Renounce the <hi>Devil</hi> and his Works, the <hi>World</hi> and the Pomp of it, the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and its Luſts; and to <hi>Promiſe,</hi> that they will Live and Dy in the <hi>Chriſtian Faith.</hi> And then, that they ſhould be <hi>Admitted,</hi> to the Communion, by <hi>Benediction</hi> and Prayers.</q>

I Offer this with the greater Confidence, becauſe an <hi>Order</hi>

like this, has been Settled of late, in ſome <hi>Churches,</hi> and is there obſerved with Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Succeſs.</q>
[Thus my Author.]</p>
            <p>Briefly, The <hi>Covenant</hi> for the Duties of the <hi>Church-State,</hi> is the <hi>Cement</hi> of a <hi>Church.</hi> The <hi>Stones</hi> of a <hi>Temple</hi> are to be well <hi>Cemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited</hi> unto one another, by an Holy <hi>Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly. The <hi>Several Parts</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> muſt <hi>Keep well together,</hi> in attending to the <hi>Duties</hi> of the <hi>Church-Covenant,</hi> which are now Expected from them. A <hi>Temple</hi> muſt <hi>Hold well together,</hi> in the Diſcharge of the <hi>Duties,</hi> whereto the <hi>Church-Covenant</hi> has obliged them that are in it. The <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> falls to Pieces, when the <hi>Church-Members</hi> may have it ſaid of them; Pſal. 78 37. <hi>They are not Stedfaſt in His Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Church-Members,</hi> You have given your ſelves unto the <hi>Church</hi> whereto you do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; Engaging, <hi>That in the Fellowſhip thereof you will attend upon the Ordinances of the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Goſpel, while your Opportunities to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Edified in your moſt Holy Faith ſhall be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued.</hi> There is much that you have now to <hi>Do Together,</hi> in waiting on the Lord, that So you may be <hi>Built Together</hi> as a <hi>Temple of the Lord</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are <hi>Duties,</hi> which the ELDERS of the <hi>Church,</hi> are to do towards the <hi>Brethren.</hi> Oh! That our Glorious LORD would help

us to <hi>Study</hi> and <hi>Practiſe</hi> our <hi>Duties!</hi> Oh! That we may Spend our Time, in <hi>Praying</hi> for our Flocks, in <hi>Treating</hi> with our Flocks, in a continual <hi>Travail</hi> for their Salvation! Oh! That we might <hi>Watch for the Souls</hi> of our People, as <hi>they that muſt give an Account</hi>; and be <hi>Prudent and Faithful Stewards</hi> of the Heavenly <hi>Mysteries</hi> unto them! Will you, Brethren, Ask for us thoſe Mercies of God?</p>
            <p>I readily acknowledge, Very many, very awful are the <hi>Duties</hi> of the <hi>Elders.</hi> But will my doing ſo, obtain for me the Liberty now to ſay, <hi>That the Duties between the Elders and the People are Mutual</hi>? If the <hi>People</hi> would allow this Conceſſion, they might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced preſently of ſeveral <hi>Miſcarriages,</hi> which <hi>We</hi> can hardly take the Liberty to mention; Only by conſidering, <hi>Should the Elders neglect the Church, as much as the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of the Church often caſt off the Elders,</hi> doubtleſs, there would be loud complaints concerning it.</p>
            <p>But between the <hi>Elders</hi> and the <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> Methinks, I ſee the DEACONS, in a <hi>Seat of Eminency,</hi> demanding, — <hi>And what ſhall we do</hi>?

You muſt not be Aſham'd nor Afraid, but with much <hi>Boldneſs</hi> tell your Neighbours, when they are Defective in doing their Part, for the Support of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>I will now go on to ſay; There are <hi>Duties</hi> which the BRETHREN of the <hi>Church,</hi> owe both to the <hi>Elders,</hi> and to one another. When Things <hi>Ly well together</hi> in the <hi>Temple,</hi> the <hi>Brethren</hi> become well diſpoſed both towards the <hi>Elders,</hi> and towards the <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> We will deſcribe their Diſpoſition. Oh! That while we are uttering the Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription, the Spirit of Grace may ſo fall upon You, Our Brethren, as to bring you into it!</p>
            <p>The Diſpoſition of the <hi>Brethren</hi> towards the <hi>Elders,</hi> is thus to be Expreſſed.</p>
            <q>
               <p>I would <hi>highly Eſteem</hi> the Men, to whoſe Conduct I am committed by the Order of GOD, while they ſhall by their Seriouſneſs and Holineſs, and Uſefulneſs, deſerve my <hi>Esteem.</hi>

               <p>I would make my daily and fervent <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> to GOD for them, that He would pour out His <hi>Bleſſings</hi> on them, and make them rich <hi>Bleſſings</hi> to His People.</p>
               <p>I would conſcientiouſly Endeavour to <hi>Support</hi> them, and Liberally <hi>Communicate in all Good Things,</hi> unto them, that while I am <hi>Spiritually Enrich'd</hi> by them, they may not Sink in <hi>Temporal Poverty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would <hi>Comfort</hi> them in their Adverſities, <hi>Defend</hi> them from their Adverſaries, <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate</hi> their Innocency from unjuſt <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.</hi>

               <p>The Diſpoſition of the <hi>Brethren</hi> towards <hi>One another</hi> is thus to be Expreſſed.</p>
               <p>I would carry the Flock before the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in my conſtant <hi>Supplications,</hi> and conſtantly <hi>Pray for the Peace</hi> of the <hi>Society.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would Study and purſue the welfare of the <hi>Society,</hi> on all accounts, as I may have Opportunity; and Studiouſly Maintain its <hi>Purity,</hi> its <hi>

and not abandon it, becauſe it is <hi>Afflicted and toſſed with Tempeſt.</hi>

CHRIST. Who are they, that are fit for for <hi>Church-Fellowſhip?</hi> we read, Eph. 1.1. <hi>The Saints, and Faithful in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Before we come to be in a <hi>Church,</hi> we ſhould be <hi>in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> They that are not <hi>in</hi> the Lord JESUS CHRIST, and that are not <hi>New Creatures,</hi> and that are not <hi>Holy Ones Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Heavenly Calling</hi>; are not Sound Members of the <hi>Church.</hi> Our Firſt work muſt be to make ſure of this, That we be <hi>in</hi> the Lord JESUS CHRIST, by Accepting of Him, as He is Offered unto us. Then we may come to be <hi>in the church,</hi> and welcome. And the Grand care of every One, that is in the Church, it ſhould run upon this; <hi>Am I in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, or no</hi>? It is not being <hi>in the Church,</hi> that will deliver a man from the Wrath of God. No; 'Tis being <hi>in</hi> the Lord JESUS CHRIST. Our main care muſt be that; Phil. 3 9. <hi>Oh! That I may be found in Him</hi>!</p>
            <p>Secondly. <hi>In Him</hi>! — 'Tis a Reſpect unto <hi>Him,</hi> that muſt hold us together. <hi>Church-Members</hi> muſt be United in Reſpect unto the Lord JESUS CHRIST. This, This muſt be the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niting Principle</hi> among us. All <hi>Church-Members</hi> muſt <hi>hold together</hi> in making the Lord JESUS CHRIST their <hi>Foundation.</hi> 'Tis no <hi>Temple</hi> of GOD, which is not <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited</hi> upon that <hi>Foundation.</hi> We read, Col. 2.19. <hi>Holding the Head,</hi> is neceſſary. A <hi>Church</hi> falls, if the Members thereof, do
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001408_0023_0FB2FB540358FAB8"/>
not concur, in their <hi>Apprehenſions</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST; in their <hi>Inclinations</hi> to the Lord JESUS CHRIST. The <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niting Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of a <hi>Church</hi> muſt be This; All the Members of it, muſt believe, That JESUS is CHRIST, and that CHRIST is GOD; and, That the Things Reveled and Reported in the Goſpel, are <hi>Faithful Sayings.</hi> And all the Members of it, muſt <hi>Prize</hi> CHRIST, as the <hi>Pearl of Great Price,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> CHRIST, as the <hi>Altogether Lovely One,</hi> &amp; <hi>Serve</hi> CHRIST as their only Lord, and prefer a Portion in CHRIST above any Worldly Portion. This is One of the admirable Inſtances of our GODS <hi>Gathering together all things in CHRIST.</hi> The Members of the <hi>Church</hi> are <hi>Gathered together</hi>; and it is their <hi>Belief</hi> of CHRIST, and their <hi>Homage</hi> to CHRIST, by which they are <hi>Gathered</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. <hi>In Him!</hi> — 'Tis on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Him,</hi> that we are to take up a <hi>Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> for one another. All <hi>Church-Members</hi> muſt be <hi>Kind unto One another,</hi> becauſe of the Lord JESUS CHRIST. There is, 2 Pet. 1.7. <hi>A Brotherly-Kindneſs,</hi> that muſt Sweeten the whole carriage of <hi>Church-Members</hi> towards One another. Now this <hi>Brotherly-Kindneſs,</hi> wherein we are to <hi>Love as Brethren,</hi> what muſt it be <hi>Built</hi> upon? It muſt be Built upon the <hi>Command</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Lord JESUS CHRIST, has given us this <hi>Command, Love One another, <hi>Therefore</hi>
               </hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:001408_0024_0FB2FB5637B1A8F0"/>
we ſhould forbear Injuring or Provoking one another; <hi>Therefore</hi> we ſhould <hi>Pleaſe each other to Edification; <hi>Therefore</hi>
               </hi> we ſhould be Serviceable to each other, and be ready to do each other all the Good that ever we can. Again; It muſt be Built upon the <hi>Image</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST. We may See ſomething of the <hi>Image</hi> of the Lord JESUS CHRIST in One another; <hi>Therefore,</hi> and <hi>ſo far,</hi> we ſhould have a <hi>Value</hi> for One another; <hi>Therefore</hi> we ſhould <hi>bear One anothers Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens,</hi> and make as light as we can of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities wherewith any render themſelves <hi>Burdenſome</hi> unto us; <hi>Therefore</hi> we ſhould cloſe with one another, and come together cheerfully and heartily.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſhall render our ſelves, <hi>A Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, built up together in our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>We are this Day concerned with a <hi>People,</hi> which we now ſee growing into ſuch a TEMPLE.

               <p>I muſt have my WISHES, more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly yet, and more pathetically adapted for you.

That your <hi>Miniſter,</hi> may be a Man <hi>Diligent in his Buſineſs,</hi> becauſe he <hi>Stands before the King of Kings</hi>: A Man that ſhall make it his <hi>whole Buſineſs,</hi> to Know <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; Preach <hi>Chriſt,</hi> &amp; Serve <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Win Souls</hi> unto Him, and feed you with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> which is the <hi>Food of Angels</hi>: A Man that ſhall main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an Holy, Humble, Trembling, &amp; Prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Walk with God,</hi> and render it your Safety to <hi>Follow Him,</hi> as a <hi>Follower of the Lord</hi>: A Man that where-ever he comes, will be <hi>always at Work</hi> for GOD, and for YOU; <hi>Do Good</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; Be always full of Contrivances to <hi>Do Good</hi>; Never be <hi>Well,</hi> but when Employ'd in ſome <hi>Good Work,</hi> and Study to be a <hi>Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that need not be aſhamed.</hi>

               <p>May this CHURCH of the Lord, be ſuch a TEMPLE, and ſo accommodated; Then ſhall we ſay, <hi>'Tis Good to be here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I will not break off, till I have Illuſtrated that Saying, with quoting Two paſſages.</p>
               <p>One Paſſage muſt be from our Incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Goodwin,</hi> who having deſcribed, the Grand Intention of a <hi>Congregational Church,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together,
<q>
                     <hi>To Worſhip the Lord, and Edify One another in all His Holy Ordinances</hi>;</q> adds, <q>'Tis an <hi>Honourable</hi> Aſſembly, wherein CHRIST is the Head! And they meet, not for the Good of the <hi>Common wealth</hi> directly; tho' that be honourable, yet it is nothing to the Salvation of Souls, and the Edifying of One another in the Fear of God. How there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001408_0031_0FB2FB6550C07F78"/>
ſhould all matters be carried? There ſhould nothing appear but the <hi>Preſence of Chriſt</hi>; the Love of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Power of His <hi>Grace</hi>: And then, they are the moſt <hi>honourable</hi> Meetings in the World!</q>
               </p>
               <p>Another Paſſage muſt be, from our celebrated <hi>Shepard</hi>; who in a <hi>Manuſcript,</hi> which I have in my hands, relates the Gathering of the Church at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> quickly after his coming into <hi>New England,</hi> and the condition of his own Vertuous Conſort at that time very near her Death, of a Conſumption. The Relation has theſe words in it.
<q>It pleaſed the Lord to joyn us into <hi>Church-fellowſhip.</hi> After the Day was ended, we came to her Chamber, She being unable to come unto us. And becauſe we feared, her End was not far off, we did ſolemnly ask her, <hi>If ſhe was deſirous to be a Member with us.</hi> Which ſhe Expreſſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſo Entring into <hi>Covenant</hi> with us, we there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon all took her by the hand, and received her as become One with us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> having had full Trial &amp; Experience of her Faith &amp; Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. At this Time, and by this means, the Lord did not only ſhow us the worth of this Ordinance, but gave us a Seal of His Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of us, and of His Preſence with us <hi>that Day.</hi> For the Lord hereby fill'd her Heart, with ſuch unſpeakable Joy and Aſſurance of Gods Love, that She ſaid to us, <hi>She had now Enough</hi>; and we were afraid, her Feeble Body, would have at that time fallen, under the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001408_0032_0FB2FB66C7493818"/>
weight of her Joy. Thus She told me; <hi>Tho' in my Judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſaw that the Lord had Loved me, yet in my Affection I fear'd, that there might be ſome flaw in my Heart, Some Sin in my Soul, which might Separate between me &amp; my God, at the Laſt, which I neither Saw, nor Others could diſcern: But now, by this Ordinance, the Lord hath Satisfied &amp; driven away my Fears. I look on my Entrance into the Church of Christ here, as a Reſemblance &amp; Fore-runner, of my Entrance into the Kingdom of Heaven among the Saints there. And tho' I know, that Hypocrites are, &amp; may be received into the Boſom of the Church, yet I am willing the Lord ſhould try me, &amp; mend me, and by this Means, He hath Sealed it unto me, that I am not One of them.</hi> And thus, a Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night almoſt before her Death, unto her Departure, in the midſt of moſt bitter Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons &amp; anguiſhes, her Peace continued.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I return to the <hi>Temple.</hi> May this <hi>Church,</hi> be ſuch a <hi>Temple</hi>; Then, as there were <hi>Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rubims</hi> on the Walls of the <hi>Temple,</hi> the very <hi>Angels</hi> of GOD, will take Pleaſure, to Behold you, to Befriend you.</p>
               <p>Yea, Then, The Glorious LORD Himſelf, will afford a moſt gracious Preſence of His unto You. And, <hi>Lord, If thou wilt be here, we ſhall not Dye; nor ſhall the Souls of our Children Dye</hi>!</p>
               <p>The Name of this <hi>Church</hi> will be, <hi>Iehovah Shammah,</hi> THE LORD IS THERE.</p>
