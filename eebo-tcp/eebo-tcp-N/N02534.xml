            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>GOD's Command is Perfect, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7. and ſerving thorowly to furniſh the Man of God <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> every good Work. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.17. And if it has pleaſed God in any way or manner to declare his Mind about his Worſhip, there is an Obligation lying on Man, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and follow theſe Directions: And that in one thing, as well as another. But this is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> great Unhappineſs of Man, that his
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003006_0004_0FEF9BA957B71738"/>Heart does not ſtand alike diſpoſed toward every part of the Mind of God. Altho' there be ſomethings that he can readily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and comply with, yet there be ſome other parts of God's Mind, that he is averſe unto. Men are loach to own, that their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to comply with this, or that, is from a Diſlike or Diſaffection unto Truth, There is an endeavour to put a fair face, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence on the matter, as that, they are not convinced it is the Mind of God, but ſome Invention of Man. But many times there is a real Diſlike and Diſaffection, towards that part of Gods Will. And this Diſlike ariſes from ſundry things,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> the power of which, is many times very great. If Perſons have been for many Years accuſtomed to that for which they have no Warrant, it comes at length, to have as much power over them as a Law. Its a very difficult thing to bring perſons off from what they have been long uſed to; and to bring them to take directions from the Word of God. There is commonly in ſuch Caſes a Superſtitious fear, wherewith the Minds of Perſons are Exercis'd and Teaz'd. They dare not leave what they have been uſed to, leſt they ſhould Sin. They dare not admit of any alteration from what they have been uſed unto, for fear of ſome lad
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003006_0004_0FEF9BA957B71738"/>Conſequents. And hence may we obſerve (many times) that men of honeſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and it may be of moſt Zeal in Religion, prove the Greateſt oppoſers of Reforming what is amiſs in Religion, or the Worſhip of God, let there be never ſo good &amp; weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty reaſons for it. And thus we ſee, how a great defect in Obedience any, thro' a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken mind, ariſe from a good Principle, that is fear of doing amiſs. Many for fear of doing amiſs, Do amiſs, or neglect and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to do well.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Many times Perſons are much Swayed and Influenced in this matter, <hi>From the Judgment and Practice</hi> of ſuch as they have a great eſteem of, for Knowledge, Wiſdom &amp; Piety. It is a very unſafe thing to rely wholly on the Judgment or Practice of any, in matters of Religion; but yet it many times is thus. The Judgment of men that are highly accounted of, Sways more with ſome, than the ſtrongeſt and cleareſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the World. There are, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have no great capacity of trying and weighing things, or have not accuſtomed themſelves thereto; but they rely on the Judgment of ſuch as they have a great e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of; and hence, are entirely comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them. Let theſe they admire be for or againſt the Truth, they be ſo too Joh.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003006_0005_0FEF9BAC05246BE8"/>7.48. <hi>Have any of the Rulers believed on Him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Mens diſlike unto any part of the mind of God ariſes many times from their paſſing a Judgment on things <hi>by Falſe Rules.</hi> There is no poſſibility of proving, Truth to be Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; or of proving Error to be Truth; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thoſe things may attend or follow one or the other, from whence, Perſons that have a Byaſs or their minds will take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to argoe amiſs. Thus.</p>
            <p>Perſons will ſometimes argue for the thing they hold and practice, that it right and good, from the good tendency of it, or from ſome good fruits and effects. And ſo on the other hand, its a common thing for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to argue and plead againſt the Truth, from ſome ill things that attend, or follow it. Thus Perſons may Argue againſt the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, becauſe it cauſes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. Its no ſolid Argument againſt the Truth and Goodneſs of a thing, that in ſometimes proves ſo. That which in its own nature tends to Union, Love Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may by Accident prove a cauſe to the Contrary. Rom. 7.7. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then, is the Law Sin? God Forbid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Mens diſlike unto any particular Branch of God's mind, does very often a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe <hi>from Corrupt Affections</hi> and <hi>Vicious Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> The nature of Man abounds with
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003006_0005_0FEF9BAC05246BE8"/>theſe, and hence when any Precept of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is declared and urged, that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto theſe Sinful inclinations, they diſpoſe a man to reject the ſame. And this is the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> a time; when Conſcience is pleaded and pretended, corrupt Affection, or evil Inclination is at the Bottom, and does cauſe this diſlike and rejection of the Truth As,
<list>
                  <item>1. Sometimes Sloch Men love an eaſy &amp; a cheap way of ſerving GOD, and when any thing is moved, and urged from the Word that reguires ſome Labour and Pains taking, beyond what they have been uſed to, their Slothful inclination dispoſes them to reject it, and oppoſe it. There is ſome Labour in the caſe, and that they Decline and Reject. <hi>Prod</hi> 15 19.</item>
                  <item>2 Sometimes Covetouſneſs moves Men to hate and reject a Duty moved &amp; urged. Thus when work of Charity and of Merry are urged, Covetouſneſs, cauſes a diſlike, as Luke 16 14. <hi>And the Phariſees alſo, who were Covetous, heard all theſe things and they Derided him.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3 But very often Pride is the great op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of Truth It is no Diſhonour to the wiſeſt &amp; greateſt of men to yield to Truth; but really a very commendable thing, and for a mans Honour, but many times men
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:003006_0006_0FEF9BAEB3B5A3F0"/>have this tho't, that the owning and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of ſuch a Truth, will touch their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and turn to their Diſcredit. Its ask ſome to them, to own, they have been in an Erro: It may be, they have ſpoken and done much againſt the Truth; and now the Temptation is ſtrong, to ſtand to what they have ſaid <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.10.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>By reaſon of Pride it hurts the Man that thoſe he hath oppoſed about the matter, ſhould get the Victory; and therefore he is puſhed forward by this Luft, that he may have the Victory.</p>
            <p>Sometimes Perſons are moved to reject a thing urged, as a Duty, from a Spirit of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ahiſm, or a forward diſpoſition to oppoſe Miniſters.</p>
            <p>Sometimes becauſe they have not been Adviſed with, and Conſulted in the caſe, or about the matter to be advanced, they are ſo far from Complying, that they will oppoſe; Inaſmuch as their Conſent was not asked, they will not fail to enter their Diſſent. It may be, Reader, thou groweſt angry at the Reading of theſe things, and it ſo, thou art the man, I need no more Evidence, that thou art Guilty.</p>
            <p>Well, let it be from the cauſes mentioned, or from any other Springs, its a great Sin, and a great Unhappineſs, for a man to have
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003006_0006_0FEF9BAEB3B5A3F0"/>ſuch a diſlike or diſaffection unto any part of the Mind and Will of GOD, as to reject it on that account.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In this a man deny's GOD's Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty over him, Return againſt him, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers himſelf unto GOD, and does indeed make himſelf both the Rule and End in that Worſhip that he will not have guided by GOD's Will, but by his own. <hi>Zec.</hi> 7.8. <hi>When ye Faſted, did ye Faſt at all unto me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is directly contrary unto the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion that men do commonly and freely make, <hi>viz.</hi> That they are very ready and willing to be guided and governed by the Will of GOD, if they did but know it. Now for any that make this free profeſſion, to reject a Branch of GOD's Mind, becauſe it is diſagreeing with their corrupt inelina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is a contradiction to their Profeſſion. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.16. <hi>In Works they deny him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In caſe the thing that men reject and oppoſe (through diſaffection) comes to them with ſufficient proof and evidence, its a violation of the order, that GOD has ſet, and eſtabliſhed in the Soul of Man. There is a certain Order or Law eſtabliſhed in the Soul of Man, and that is, when the eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for a thing, do plainly out-weigh, all the Objections that can be made againſt the ſame, to yield an aſſent unto the Truth of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003006_0007_0FEF9BB2E1532890"/>it; and in caſe he do otherwiſe, he offers violence unto his own mind.

                     <p>Its a matter the wiſeft and moſt able to Judge, are clear, and full in, and do aſſert, That there is a ſure and certain Rule, to be uſed, in Singing; and it is as clearly diſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, by the beſt of Judges; that this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Rule is left; and that there are many ill fruits and effects that follow upon the neglect of the Rule, or deviation from it.</p>
                     <p>Hence it is, that a multitude of Perſons, live in a neglect of this Duty. Many neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it in Publick, they open not their Mouths to Praiſe GOD. And probably many more that neglect it in their Pamilies, and becauſe they know not how to Sing.</p>
                     <p>Again, For want of knowledge and skill in Muſick, Perſons cannot have that Love to, that Delight in &amp; that Reliſh of, the Duty, as if they were Skilled &amp; did uſe their Skill. This is known to be a truth by the Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience

                  <item>(7) The Rule being neglected as uſeleſs, the Performance is very mean, compared with what it would be, were the Procedure by a Rule. It is as flat Drink, compared with that which is lively, brisk and full of Spirit: And the Eſteem of it is much ſunk, and a careleſs ſpirit prevailing about the Performance. And as it has been an unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs attending our defective, looſe way of doing, that we have been under diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages either to diſcover our Defectiveneſs, or to Reform it; ſo now, tho' we are delivered from that, as great, if not a worſe evil is met with; and that is, that having been long accuſtomed to a Looſe, Irregular way, we are now, grown into love with it, and are ſo far from any willingneſs, to Reform, that we cannot bear to have any fault found with our doings in this part of Divine Worſhip. Many are found ſo under the influence and power of Cuſtom, that they account the common performance to be better, than any Reformation can make it; and are therefore, ſo far, from hearkning to any propoſals for
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:003006_0009_0FEF9BB9115FFF80"/>a Reformation, that the Propoſal meets with not only Rejection, but very fierce Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and abundance of Cenſure and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection: And ſome, are ready to Laviſh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way as much Zeal, as tho' there were an attempt, to pluck away a Fundamental Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle in Religion, or to bring in one of the greateſt Hereſy's or deſtructive Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into the Church.

            <p n="2">2. Its an Honour due to Truth. Indeed our Zeal is to be wiſely and duely propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.

            <p>And this will leave ſuch Perſons without excuſe. Joh. 15.22. <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken unto them, they had not had Sin: But now they have no Cloak</hi> —.

No ſolid Reaſon can be rendred, why more Proof and Evidence is needful in this matter, than in many points that are more weighty.</item>

            <p>Theſe things Premiſed, I new proceed to lay down the Aſſertion to be made Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That there is One &amp; only One ſure &amp; certain Rule to preceed by, in Singing the Songs of the LORD; ſo much Knowlege of which as is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the due performance of this part of Divine Service, its the Duty of all, who are to bear a part in Singing of thoſe Songs to attain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that there is One and only One ſure and certain Rule to proceed by in Singing, may be rendred Evident by theſe following Arguments.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:003006_0010_0FEF9BBAB5844D58"/>
I. <hi>It is not conſiſtent with the Wiſdom of GOD</hi> (who deſigns His own Glory &amp; mans good in every Ordinance that He has appointed) <hi>to leave the Performance of this Duty, without a Rule to guide it ſo as to reach theſe finds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Every wiſe Agent, firſt of all propoſes to himſelf an Bud; and then proceeds to chooſe Means, fit, ſuitable, and proper, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude about the order and manner of uſing theſe Means Now if this be the way of very wiſe Men, how much more is it of GOD, who <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> all things with the moſt perfect Wiſdom. For <hi>He is wonderful in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and excellent in Working,</hi> Iſa. 28.29. As for the great end of every Ordinance, it ſuits with the great end of Mans Being; and therefore we may Conclude, from GOD's Infinite Wiſdom, that there is a Rule, whereby to proceed in this Affair. It could not Conſiſt with the Wiſdom of GOD, to leave this Performance, to the Wit, Will, or Fancy's of Men: It was not likely to be done, in a manner becoming the Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of GOD: If GOD has done ſo, he has not done like himſelf; in caſe he has done ſo, his Command is not Perfect; which we know it is, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19 7. And then by ſuch an Imperfect Command, the Man of GOD would not be Perfectly Furniſhed, unto the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003006_0011_0FEF9BBFDF1DF528"/>Performance of every good Work; which we may not allow. 2. <hi>Tim</hi> 3.16, 17. In caſe GOD has done thus, he were not the GOD of Order, but of Confuſion; but this is contrary to that, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.33.</p>
            <p>If GOD has done thus, he has done con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what he always, and in all other caſes has done; for he has always been ſo full and particular in his Directions about his Worſhip, that his Directions have extended to the outward order &amp; in very ſmall things. Hence, 1 Chron. 15.13. <hi>Becauſe we ſought him not after the due <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> in ſhort, to ſay that GOD has given no Direction or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept about the manner of Procedure, would be a Contradiction of that General Rule, 1 Cor. 14 40. <hi>Let all things be done Decently, and in Order:</hi> Which neceſſarily ſuppoſes ſome Rule, in agreement with which De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency ly's; Now this can't be Cuſtom, for Cuſtom it ſelf may be Undecent.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Its Evident there is ſome Certain Rule; for the Command to Sing, does Include and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve in it, that we uſe the Inſtrument, or Means, ſuitable and proper for the doing of the Work, or Duty Commanded to be done; and it does ſo, tho' there be no mention made of the Inſtrument, or Means in the Command.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:003006_0011_0FEF9BBFDF1DF528"/>
Its received without any Gainſaying or Diſputing, That Singing of Pſalms is a Duty Commanded; its not an Inyention of Men, but of Divine Inſtitution. Now as man is under a neceſſity of uſing Inſtruments, or Means in doing his Work, and there are Inſtruments, or Means ſuited to every ſort of Work or Buſineſs, ſo the Command to do a thing, obliges to uſe the Inſtrument ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and proper for that Work: tho' there be no mention made of the Inſtrument, or Means in the Command.</p>
            <p>Its eaſy to make this plain by a Multitude of Inſtauces, that the Servant Commanded to do a Work, is by virtue of that Command, obliged to uſe the Inſtrument proper, and ſuitable for the doing of that Work. It is ſo in <hi>Writing, Meaſuring, Weighing, &amp;c.</hi> And he that teaches Man more than the Beaſts of the Earth, and makes us Wiſer than the Fowls of Heaven, doth inſtruct man to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, in this point. Iſa. 28 26, 27, 28. — <hi>For the Fitches are not threſhed with a threſhing Inſtrument, nor is a Cart-wheel turned about upon the Gammin, &amp;c.</hi> It is not a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Indifferency, what Inſtrument the Servant goes to work with: But the Servant that attempts to work without an Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or to uſe an Inſtrument or Means, not at all ſuited to the work, may be as really
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003006_0012_0FEF9BC1A09E24B8"/>Guilty of Diſobedience, as he that wholly neglects the doing of the thing Luk. 12.47. <hi>And that Servant that knew his Lords will, and prepared not himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if there be an Inſtrument or Means, that is ſuited, and appropriated to this work; then it may be Concluded, that the Command to Sing, does include that, and oblige to the uſe of it in performance of the Work. Now this will preſently appear. From Hence,</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>In as much as there is but only One In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument or Means, that is it, or ſuitable for the doing of this Work; and therefore its a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to uſe it in the doing of the Work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is a matter as clear, as the Noon-Day-Light; that if I am Commanded to do any work, and there be only one Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Means, wherewith the work can be done, its my Duty to uſe that Inſtrument or Means. Its true, there be ſome Works, that may be performed by Various Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but ordinarily, to each work to be done, there is an Inſtrument or Means that is ſuited, and appropriated to that work: And it is founded in the very nature of things: The work being of ſuch a Nature, the Efficient muſt have an Inſtrument, ſo
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003006_0012_0FEF9BC1A09E24B8"/>and ſo, fitted and ſuited to do that work with, and it is certain, that there are many works that have inſtruments ſo appropriated to that work, that the work can't be done, without that Inſtrument. It is ſo in <hi>Reading, Cyphering, Weighing, Meaſuring, &amp;c.</hi> There is no Reading without the knowledge of the Letters, and of Joyning them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. No caſting accounts without Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Each of theſe and a great many others, have their appropriated Inſtruments or Means. The work commanded to be done, can't be done without the proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument or Means. And it being ſo, it can be no matter of doubt whether it be a Duty or not, to uſe that Inſtrument, ſeeing the work coramanded can't be done without it, And now to apyly it to the preſent Caſe, We are Commanded to Sing, and there is but one Inſtrument or Means, ſuited to this work, wherewith the work can be done; And this is THE ART OF MUSICK. The deſign of Art is, by ſuitable means to guide the mind of Man in the management of that whereto the Art relates: Now Arts are very Numerous; to almoſt every Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, there is an Art; which is the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Means for the doing of that thing whereto it relates. New there is no Art or Science that teaches to Sing, but one, and
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003006_0013_0FEF9BC6CF7BC690"/>that is The Art of <hi>Muſick, Logick</hi> teaches to <hi>Reaſon</hi> well, <hi>Navigation</hi> to <hi>Sail</hi> well, <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry</hi> to <hi>Meaſure</hi> well; But only <hi>Muſick</hi> Teaches to <hi>Sing</hi> well. And there being no other Art or Inſtrument, to direct or ſerve to this Work, it muſt be a Duty to uſe it. And therefore, the Notion that ſome have of Various Rules, is utterly Vain; becauſe there is but one Art that Teaches any thing about the Work. This Inſtrument is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to the Work, and can be done with no other. Wherefore, I reaſon thus, Either GOD has given us but One Rule, or Various, or None at all. As for his giving us None, that can't Conſiſt with His Wiſdom. As for there being Various, that can't be, becauſe there is but one Art that Teaches any thing about it. And therefore there is One, and but One Rule.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But it may be, it will be Objected, That thoſe that Write about the Art of Muſick may Vary, and therefore it looks, as though there may be Various Rules, and a matter of Indifferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which we uſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Objection ſeems to Contain in it, an acknowledgment of a Rule, and if this be but yielded, the difficulty about the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety is eaſily removed. And therefore
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003006_0013_0FEF9BC6CF7BC690"/>I Anſwer That it is a very common thing, for ſuch as write about any Art or Science, to Vary; ſcarce any two men that write a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout any Art, do exactly agree in every thing. But then
<list>
                  <item>1. This don't argue the Rule or the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to be Various Truth is but One, &amp; it holds true of every Art. No Art delivers any more, but one Body of Rules, to lead unto the end the Art aims at. And there is no other Variety, or Multiplicity of Rules, but what ariſes from the differing apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Men. And this is plain and evident from the nature of each work to be done; the Inſtrument muſt needs have its make and ſhape, according to the nature of the work that is to be done by it; thus a <hi>Knife,</hi> a <hi>Key,</hi> a <hi>Pen,</hi> are fitted to the nature of the work to be done with them. And this is alſo further Evident from hence, In as much as no man, that writes about any Art or Science, pretends to give any more, but one Directory, or one Body of Rules leading to the end that the Art aims at: Which is a very plain proof that the Variety is not founded in the Nature of the thing, but ariſes from the differing thoughts of Men.</item>
                  <item>2. There being ſome difference among Writers, about the Art of Muſick, is no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Objection againſt the owning of it to be
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003006_0014_0FEF9BC879214650"/>the Rule, and only Rule of Singing. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing this Objection to be Valid, we muſt Renounce every Art and Science in the World: Nay, we moſt Renounce Divinity it ſelf; for in This Writers diſagree proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more than in Humane Arts: But we don't do thus in other Caſes We many times find that Weights &amp; Meaſures don't agree, and yet we own that Weights and Meaſures are the true Rule of Buying and Selling. In caſe we ſhould Renounce Arts and Sciences becauſe of the diſagreement of Writers about them, we could ſcarce carry on any Affair in the World. But then</item>
                  <item>3 It may be offered farther in Anſwer to this Objection, that the diſagreement of Writers that we are acquainted with, is ſo ſmall, that it need make no difficulty, were it greater. A little Humane Prudence in following one Author that is beſt approved, puts an end to all the difficulty, and is no more, than what we are enforced to do in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Caſes; and is well agreeing with the Divine Rule, 1 <hi>Theſ</hi> 5.21. <hi>Prove all things; and hold faſt that which is Good.</hi>

If this be made evident, the point is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently proved.</p>
            <p>All Gifts are from GOD. Every uſeful Art and Science among Men, is as really from GOD as Saving Grace, Jam. 1.17. <hi>He is the Father of Lights; from whom cometh down every Good and Perfect Gift.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is certain that no Man can receive any thing of this nature unleſs it be given him of GOD. And theſe Gifts are beſtowed on Men to direct and enable them in anſwering the great End of their Being, <hi>viz.</hi> To Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify GOD, and to do good in the World, to Profit withal, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 12.7.

This is plain from Scripture, Rom. 12.6. <hi>Having then Giſts, differing</hi>—. 1 Pet. 4.10. <hi>As every one has received the Gift, even ſo Miniſter.</hi> Men ſeem not to be in doubt in other caſes: If a man be called to a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary Poſt, he doubts not but he muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, and muſt act by Military Skill.

<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003006_0015_0FEF9BCB77463138"/>uſe the Art of <hi>Navigation.</hi> If a Man be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be a Surveyor or Meaſurer of Land, he doubts not but he muſt uſe the Art of <hi>Geometry.</hi> If a Man be called to the Work of the Miniſtry, he muſt now uſe the <hi>Miniſterial Gifts</hi> he has received. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54 4. If a Man had beſtowed on him the Gift of Tongues, and GOD ſhould ſend him to Preach to a Heathen People of a ſtrange Language, and he had no other way to make them underſtand, but by ſpeaking to them in their own Tongue, it would be his Duty to do ſo, tho' GOD had never made any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular mention of it in his Command. He ought to uſe the Ability that God had given him. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.11.</p>
            <p>It were eaſy to multiply Inſtances of this kind to make it plain, that GOD having be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed a Gift on men, enabling to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of a certain work, it ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved about the Work, if God calls thereto.</p>
            <p>Now we are to remember, there are Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for Private Men to attend, and for the better diſcharge of which, they want Gifts, and ſhould Covet them; as the Gift of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and the Gift of Singing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12 <hi>ult.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.4. And having Attained them they ſhould Improve them in the doing of that Work they relate to, and enable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. Wherefore I reaſon thus, Either GOD
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003006_0015_0FEF9BCB77463138"/>has given this Gift or Art of <hi>Muſick</hi> to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved in Singing Songs of Praiſe unto His Name, or Given it to be improved in plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Mens Luſts, or he has Given it in Vain: But not the Two Latter, and therefore the Former.</p>
            <p n="5">V. <hi>I Argue in the next place from Scripture Precept and the agreeing Practice of the People of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From what I have offered already, the matter might be Concluded which has been laid down to be Proved; and that it is not a matter of Indifferency how we Sing, but a matter of Duty to proceed by that ONE CERTAIN RULE. There are doubtleſs many things that are Duties, and Neceſſary to be done, that we can find no particular Precept for, and yet may be fairly Argued to be Duties from ſome General Rules. Where do we find any Precept or Command to teach our Children to Read? And yet Who is there that does ſo much as doubt of it? If it be their Duty to Read, then they ſhould be enabled to do their Duty, by being learn'd to Read. And ſo the Caſe before us may be in this manner Argued to be a Duty, tho' there were no particular Precept about it. Its our Duty to Sing, and therefore we
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003006_0016_0FEF9BCE6AB39C30"/>ſhould endeavour to furniſh ourſelves with the knowledge of the Rule. But beſides this, GOD has been pleaſed to declare to us in the Scripture how his People of Old were wont to perform this Duty, and how he would have us do in the Affair.</p>
            <p>And here, beſides the General Precept, 1 Cor. 14.40. <hi>To do all things</hi> in the Publick Worſhip of GOD <hi>Decently and in Order.</hi> Which certainly ſuppoſes ſome Rule in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement with which Decency ly's.</p>
            <p>We are Commanded to Sing with Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. Its an Old Teſtament Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. <hi>Pſal</hi> 47.7. And its mentioned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in the New Teſtament, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.15. And becauſe it is ſo, it makes it more plain to be underſtood. Its ſafeſt to take the Scripture in the largeſt ſenſe; and then, there will be Three things contained in this Singing with the Underſtanding.</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1.) An Underſtanding of the End and Deſign of the Ordinance.</item>
               <item>(2.) An Underſtanding of the Matter that is Sung. And then,</item>
               <item>(3.) An Underſtanding of the True Rule and manner of Performance.</item>
            </list>
            <p>I ſee no Objection that can be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this account of the Text <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003006_0016_0FEF9BCE6AB39C30"/>the People of GOD of Old, did Sing thus. They proceeded in it by a certain Rule; and this is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Its plain from hence, That GOD's People did proceed by a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rule. There was care taken that thoſe that were to be concerned in Singing, ſhould be furniſhed with Skill; and to that end, they were under the Inſtruction of One that was an Artiſt. It is plain, that the thing he taught them, was how to Sing: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was the Art of MUSICK that he Taught. It is evident that he taught them to Sing by Rule; for it were very Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to call him Skilful, in caſe he were not acquainted with the Rule. It is evident their Inſtrumental Muſick was by Art, and ſo it is alſo that their Vocal was 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25. 7. <hi>They were Inſtructed in the Songs of the Lord, all that were Cunning</hi> or Skilful.</p>
            <p>And there is much of Argument for the point, to be drawn from the Titles of the Pſalms. <hi>David</hi> having Compoſed a Pſalm, directed or delivered it to the Chief Muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, to be Sung by the Rules of Art. And among the many Titles of the Pſalms, we may take notice of ſome that plainly hold
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003006_0017_0FEF9BD0A22E7918"/>out to us, not only that they Sung by Rule, but that they uſed the various parts that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to Muſick: As might be inſtanced in <hi>Suminith,</hi> which is ſuppoſed to intend on the Loweſt part, or Baſe. And <hi>Alamoth,</hi> which intends the Treble, being ſhrill like a Virgins Voice. Unto all which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical Precept may be added, Eph. 5.19. <hi>Speaking to your ſolves in Pſalms, Hymns, and Spiritual Songs, making Melody in your Heart to the Lord.</hi> Col. 3.16. <hi>Teaching and Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing one another, in Pſalms, Hymns, and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Songs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>There is One, and only One, Sure and Certain Rule to proceed by in this Affair, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe its Impoſſible there ſhould be a due Union among them that Joyn in Singing the Songs of the LORD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely, none will deny but, that there ſhould be Union; Rom. 15 6. <hi>That ye may with one mind and one mouth Gloriſy GOD.</hi> It is certain it may be, it has been, and it ſhould be, 2 Chron. 5.13. <hi>They were as One to make one Sound:</hi> Which muſt be underſtood of a Muſical Unity, or Concord.: All on the ſame Noto; all begin and end together. And indeed, ſo much as there is of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union, ſo much of Confuſion &amp; Diſorder. Now
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:003006_0017_0FEF9BD0A22E7918"/>unleſs there be only One certain Rule to proceed by, this can't be expected; ſcarcely among thoſe of the ſame Congregation, but in caſe thoſe of differing Congregations are to join, its much more unlikely, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.7, 8.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. <hi>Unleſs there be only One certain Rule,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the excellent Ends to be Aimed at in the Performance of this Duty, cannot be ſo well reached and gained.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Great and Ultimate Ends of this Ordinance, it has been hinted; As for the particular and next ends, they are to utter GOD's Praiſes, to give to us a deeper ſenſe of GOD, ſuitably to move our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, to improve our Joy, expreſs our Thankfulneſs, encourage our Hope, give us ſome Taſt of Divine Pleaſure, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now we can't diſcern how theſe excellent ends can be reach'd unleſs there be a Procedure by a certain Rule.</p>
            <p>It is a very great Reflection on any Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Art, in uſe among Men, for any to ſay that all the ends of it may be gained as well without the Art as with it; for Men to ſay they can Sail as well without the Art of Navigation as with it; or, that they can do any thing in Arithmetick, as well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Art as with it: or, that they can read
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003006_0018_0FEF9BD4AF8F4718"/>any Author, without ever learning the Art of Reading. But its againſt the common ſenſe of Mankind, and their daily experience, that the ends of Art can be gained ſo well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Art as with it. And againſt the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Spirit of GOD, who has ſaid that Wiſdom is Profitable to Direct. <hi>Ecel.</hi> 10.10.</p>
            <p>I know this very Plea is made in Defence of Singing without Regard to Rule, and againſt Singing by a Rule.</p>
            <p>The OBJECTION is this, Object. <hi>This way of Singing that is in uſe in the Country Anſwers the End as well; I find</hi> (ſays one) <hi>it raiſes my Affections much more than Singing by a Rule; and therefore I muſt needs like This way, and diſlike the Regular way of Singing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Its needful I give a particular An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to this Objection. And,
<list>
                  <item>1. I don't ſuppoſe, but that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way of Singing may have ſome of theſe Good Effects. But then,</item>
                  <item>2 I would Suggeſt this, its more than Probable, that it reaches theſe Good Ends, no further than its agreeing with the Rule. There are but Two ways (that I know of)
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:003006_0018_0FEF9BD4AF8F4718"/>in which the Duty can attain them; the one is Natural, from the Natural tendency in Muſick to move, or raiſe the Affections. The other is Moral, by the Bleſſing of GOD on the Ordinance. Now its readily Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that ſo far as the common way of Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agrees with the Rule, ſo far it may in a natural way tend to raiſe the Affections, and ſo far the Bleſſing of GOD may go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with it. For it is to be Remembred, that our Singing was Originally by Rule, the very Rule we now Plead for the uſe of. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Song that we Sing, was Originally Compoſed by the Art of Muſick; and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections given us to Sing the Tunes by. Which thing is as evident, as any thing of this Nature can be. Now tho' the Rule has been long neglected, and diſregarded, and we have ſwerved very much therefrom, in various Regards, yet is there in every Song that we Sing, ſome agreement with the Rule; and in proportion to what there is of agreement with the Rule, ſo far it may both in a Natural, and in a Moral way have ſome of theſe Good Effects. But yet,</item>
                  <item>3. I would mind you in the next place, that this can be no certain Rule to Judge by, whether the Duty be well or ill done, that the Affections are moved or not moved.
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:003006_0019_0FEF95F98549E1C0"/>The Affections are indifferent to Good or Evil. We are liable to be much pleaſed with our performances, when as they are very unpleaſing to GOD.</item>
                  <item>4. And as for your diſlike of Regular Singing, becauſe it don't raiſe or move your Affections: I Anſwer in Two things.

                        <item>(2) It can't be expected it ſhould move your Affections ſo long as you don't like it, but are full of Prejudice towards it. There can be no Pleaſure in That a Man is full of Enmity towards.</item>

            <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Unleſs there be a certain Rule, there can't be any certain End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the Ends for which the Ordinance has been appointed, they are Certain, and there muſt needs be a Certain Rule to lead to a Certain End. The deſign and uſe of a Rule is by ſuitable means to lead to a Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain End. And there can be no Certainty in the End, unleſs there be a Certain Rule. Hence that 1 Cor. 14.8. <hi>If the Trumpet give an uncertain Sound, who ſhall prepare himſelf to the Battle?</hi> In caſe there be no Rule at all, we are as a man that wanders, in the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003006_0019_0FEF95F98549E1C0"/>Wilderneſs without <hi>Path</hi> or <hi>Compaſs:</hi> In caſe there be various Rules, they muſt lead to differing Ends to be ſure, Differing, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the difference there is in the Rules or Means. And this ſhews it can't be a matter of indifferency how we Sing: Becauſe that various Rules, or various Means lead to various Ends.</p>

            </p>
            <p>We have a power of Reflection in our Souls, whereby we can look back on our Actions and Judge whether well or ill done; and it well becomes Reaſonable Creatures to do ſo. Gal. 6.4. <hi>Lee every Man prove his own Work.</hi> Now unleſs there be a certain Rule to direct and guide the Performance, there is no poſſibility of paſſing any Judgment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, becauſe this matter is diſcernable only by the Rule. Rom. 3.20. — <hi>By the Law is the Knowledge of Sin.</hi> We come to know whether a Work be well or ill done by comparing it with the Rule. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in caſe there be no certain Rule, there can be no Judgment paſs'd on the Work or Duty done.</p>

X. <hi>In caſe there be not a certain Rule to proceed by in Singing the Songs of the Lord, there can be no Rectifying of any thing amiſs in the Duty or Performance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I take it for Granted, that none will Deny, but this Ordinance is liable to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. There can be no reaſon rendred why it ſhould be impoſſible to fall into a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective way. If all other Ordinances are liable to be Corrupted, Why not This? And ſurely its the Duty of GOD's People when it is become ſo, to endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and Rectify what is amiſs. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a thing Provoking to GOD, to be careleſs of the due Order in Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.13. Now in caſe there be no certain Rule, there is no poſſibility of Rectifying what is amiſs in it. Becauſe it muſt be done by the Rule, and can be done no other Way. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.9. <hi>Wherewith ſhall a Young Man Cleanſe his way? By taking heed thereto according to thy Word.</hi> To Recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy a thing amiſs is to bring it to agree with the Rule. It is by the Standard that Weights and Meaſures muſt be brought to be True. And how can this be effected in caſe there be no Standard. And this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers the extreme. Folly of ſome who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and reject the uſe of a certain Rule in
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:003006_0020_0FEF9BD9686CE468"/>Singing, and yet will attempt to Rectify the Common way of Singing without a Rule.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. <hi>In caſe there be not a certain Rule, there can be neither Well Doing, nor Ill Doing in the Caſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Inference may ſeem ſomewhat Strange and Surpriſing, that there ſhould be any One Ordinance, to be attended on, in which we can neither do Well, nor Ill; and yet this is fairly drawn, and does moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow. It plainly appears from hence, Inasmuch as Well Doing lyes in a perfect Agreement with the Rule, and Ill Doing in a Diſagreement with the Rule This is the true and proper notion of Well Doing, and of Ill Doing, Gen. 4.7. <hi>If thou doeſt Well, ſhalt thou not be Accepted? If thou doeſt. Not well, Sin lyes at thy Door.</hi> And therefore if there be not a certain Rule there can be no Agreement or Deviation Rom. 4.15. — <hi>Where no Law is, there is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p n="12">XII. <hi>In caſe there be not a certain Rule, the Matter admits of no Skill; it is utterly uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any Skill.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:003006_0021_0FEF9BDCB48BFB08"/>
Study none will deny but that this Aſtir does admit of Skill. There is ſurely need of Skill to perform it. Should any deny it, it were eaſie to Confute them from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Reaſon too. It was accounted need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in Antient Times. When <hi>David</hi> had Compoſed a Pſalm, he directed it to the <hi>Chief Muſician,</hi> one that was excellently Skill'd. And 1 Chron. 15.22 <hi>Chenaniah luſtructed about the Song becauſe be was Skilful.</hi> Skill was in thoſe times accounted needful; it was ſought after, and care was taken that thoſe that were to Sing might be turniſhed with Skill Yea a plain Command to uſe Skill, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 33 3. But in caſe there be no certain Rule, there can be no Skill. And this is plain from the Nature of Skill, for Skill lyes in a due knowledge of the Rule, and aptneſs or readineſs to act by it, or in agreement with it, this is the true and proper Motion of Skill, as is plain from the Inſtance given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of Chenaniah. Its ſaid he was Skilful. i. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. He was acquainted with the Rule, and able to guide others into the knowledge of it. And therefore the knowledge that many are ſuppoſed to have in Singing, who are ignorant of the Rule, is not Skill; No more than a Child can be ſaid to have skill in Reading, becauſe he can ſay a few Anſwers in the Catechiſm by Rote; when as it may
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:003006_0021_0FEF9BDCB48BFB08"/>be he can't tell half the Letters of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet.</p>
            <p>I therefore Conclude this Argument thus, Either the matter does not require Skill, or Men are born Artiſts, or elſe there is a certain Rule; but the two former muſt be Deny'd, and therefore the laſt muſt be Aſſerted.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. <hi>In caſe there be not a certain Rule to proceed by, but the Manner be leſt indiſſerent; then men have an Advantage put into their bands to Aſſront the Majeſty of Heaven with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Treſpaſs or Offence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The deſign of this Ordinance is to glorify GOD; and GOD who is the Object, that it is directed unto, being of ſuch Tranſcendent Excellency and Glory, the Worſhip ſhould certainly be done in the beſt manner Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It is very unſuitable and unbecoming to turn GOD off with that which is mean when as it is in our Power to do better, Mal. 1. 14. <hi>Curſed be the Deceiver who hath in his ſtock a Male,</hi> &amp;c. But in caſe there be no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Rule to proceed by, Advantage is put into the hands of Men to Affront the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Heaven without Treſpaſs, by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Him off with what is mean, unſuitable and unbecoming. In caſe GOD had not
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:003006_0022_0FEF9BE15E78B860"/>Caution'd his People, not to offer to him any thing that had a Blemiſh in it, but had left it intirely to their liberty to offer what they would, ſo they did but offer: Have we not reaſon to think, that they would have turned him off with the Torn, Lame, Maim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſurely they would have done ſo, in caſe they could have done it without Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing on a Divine Command: for they did ſo, notwithſtanding they had an expreſs Command about the Matter. And exctly thus, would it be in the Affair before us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Singing, if there were no certain Rule to guide and govern the Affair. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, this is truly the fruit of our leaving the Rule, and taking our Direction from Cuſtom and Fancy. It does naturally tend to Sink the eſteem of the Ordinence, and to make Men careleſs how they perform the ſame</p>
            <p>Its Lamentable to every Serious and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious Mind, who is concerned that GOD ſhould be Worſhipped in the beſt manner, to obſerve how Shameful, Mean and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective our Sacrifices of Praiſe are.

XIV. <hi>In caſe Man have a certain Rule, to guide him to his great End in the General, he muſt needs have a certain Rule to guide him in the uſe of all thoſe means that are to lead than way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I truſt I need not ſtand to make good the former; it is a conceded point, that as Mans Great and Chief end is to Glorify &amp; Enjoy GOD, ſo GOD has given him a Rule to lead him to this End: And if this be his great and main Buſineſs, he muſt never be without a Rule; and one that is full, perfect and compleat. And in caſe he muſt have a Rule in the concerns of this Life, how much more in the things that do immediately concern GOD's Glory. In caſe Man have no certain Rule, to guide him in this Affair, then ſo far, he goes as in a Wilderneſs, without any Path, in the Dark not knowing whither he Steers right to his End or not.

            <p>This may ſeem to be ſomewhat ſtrange at the firſt tho'r, but is eaſily made plain by many Inſtances about the Affairs of this Life, wherein Art is uſed to direct Men in the Deſign that they are Purſuing: Were it
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:003006_0023_0FEF9BE4707F7760"/>not for the Help Men have from Art they could not carry on, or manage the Affair at all. It were Impracticable. How were it Poſſible for men to perform vaſt Voyages, from one ſide of the World to the other, without the help of the Art of Navigation or Compaſs? How would it be Poſſible for Men to manage vaſt Accounts, in which it would be needful to Add, Divide, Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in caſe there were not a certain Rule to guide and enable Men to do it?

The matter is really thus in the Caſe before us about Singing: There can be no Singing at all without a Rule. Let the Rule that we make ſome uſe of, be wholly ſaid aſide, as it is in part, and we cannot Sing at all. It would be a confuſed Noiſe, &amp; not Singing. Let the Rule be wholly ſaid aſide, and we ſhall be like a Ship in the Sea, without Compaſs or Rudder, or any means to guide her towards a Haven, toſſed hither and thither.</p>

            <p>It is very true, that this fort of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is not of that ſtrength and force with the former; however, it will Contribute ſomewhat; and its a common thing, for Men to lay Weight on the Judgment, Sayes and Practices of others. And therefore let them caſt in their Mite.</p>
            <p>And
<list>
                  <item>[1] I ſhall Argue <hi>from the Judgment of the Learned and moſt Knowing,</hi> who ever Aſſert the Art of Muſick, to guide and direct in Singing the Songs of the Lord. Poetry &amp; Muſick, have ever been acknowledged among the Learned, as Real Arts and very Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, both of them Contributing to the perfecting of the ſame deſign; the former is employed in Compoſing the Song, and the latter directs rightly to Modulate the Voice in the Singing of it. And the Learned ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count no Singing true but what is by Rule. And ſurely they ſhould be acknowledged to be the beſt Judges in the Caſe. In other caſes Men will have a regard to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Artiſt's, in things pertaining to the Art that they profeſs to be knowing and skilful in; and there is as much reaſon to Regard &amp; Honour it here, as in other Caſes.</item>

Concerning which! would Argue thus, Either our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers Practiced by the Rule they have left for us, or not, In caſe they did the point is Gain'd; In caſe they did not, they were very Deceitful and Hypocritical, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to CHRIST's own Judgment. Mat. 23.3, 4. — <hi>They ſay, and do not.</hi>
                     <p>If the thing now pleaded for be right, we ſhould uſe it, tho' our Fore-fathers had neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected it; for tho' we are to honour Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, we are to live by Precepts. GOD's Precepts ſhould move us more than our fore-Fathers Example; but ſeeing we have our Fore-fathers good Example, it ſhould ſerve to move us yet more.</p>
                  </item>
                  <item>[3] I ſhall Argue <hi>from the Plea and Practice of ſuch as are againſt a Rule,</hi> in their making ſome uſe of the Rule, and their ſpeaking of right and wrong in Singing. It is very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural unto each. Man, that differs in Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from his Neighbour, to challenge to himſelf this Honour and Happineſs, that he is in the right and his Neighbour is in the wrong. And its to be ſeen in this matter about Singing as well as in any other thing.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:003006_0024_0FEF9BE798CB7920"/>
The difference among Towns in Singing is Great, ſcarce any two Towns that Sing perfectly alike, and ſome differ very much: And yet each Town or Perſon aſſerts they are in the right &amp; their Neighbour is in the wrong: Now this is a virtual or implicit yielding and acknowledging that there is ſome Rule, by which a Judgment may be made. Upon which I would ſay only this, Rom. 14.22. <hi>Happy is the Man that condemns not himſelf in the thing that he allows.</hi> Its an odd thing to blame our Neighbours, for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſides, or againſt Rule, whenas we our ſelves acknowledge no Rule. But then I would have a remark, on theſe Mens ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſome uſe of the Rule. I have before made mention of this, that our Singing was Originally owing to the Rule, and the very Rule we plead for; and that there is ſome uſe made of the Rule in every Song. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I would reaſon thus, If there be no certain Rule, why do you make any uſe of one? In caſe there be a Rule as your Practice declares, why don't you conform wholly to it? Its beyond the wiſeft Man in the World to Reconcile this matter, <hi>to wit,</hi> How it ſhould be a Duty to make ſome uſe of the Rule, and yet be ſo Heinous a thing to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form wholly to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:003006_0025_0FEF9BE92D0BEBE0"/>
It is certain, Men don't uſually Argue ſo in other Caſes. Men can ordinarily ſee in other things, that the degree don't alter the kind.</p>
            <p>What wiſe Man would judge thus, that its a Lawful thing to Read, or to Write, but a very abominable thing to Read or Write exectly and well? Or that its a Lawful thing and a Duty to uſe Weights and Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fures, but an intolerable thing to have them Exact and True. And yet this is the very caſe before us: We know aſſuredly there is ſome uſe made of the Rule in the common Singing. We only plead for an intire Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Rule; And ſee how its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented and oppoſed, as an Inſufferable thing. And thus I have offered the Arguments for the evidence and proof of the Aſſertion laid down. But tho' here be vaſtly more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and proof, than we have or can have, for many things that we readily own and hold in Religion, yet the diſaffection of Men to the Thing and their deep prejudices make light of all the weightieſt Arguments.</p>
            <p>And, Object. 1. <hi>This Practice leads to the Church of England and will bring in Organs quickly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. In caſe the thing be a Duty, we need not be afraid of any ill Tendency; the way of Duty is the way of Safety.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:003006_0025_0FEF9BE92D0BEBE0"/>
2. Its beyond the wiſeſt man in the World to imagine how Skilful Singing, ſhould lead or tend to ill, more than Unſkilful; we may as well plead that Skilful Writing, or Skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in Arithmetick tends to ill. There is nothing in the nature of the thing that leads to the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. But ſuppoſe it were poſſible for any to make ſome ill improvement of it. Its againſt the common ſenſe of mankind to reject any ingenious Art or Science in uſe among Men, becauſe it may be ill improved, or abuſed by ſome.</p>
            <p>Becauſe Printing is, or may be ill impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved unto the Venting of the worſt Errors and Hereſies, and the moſt Lewd and Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked things that Debauch Ma kind, ſhall we refuſe to uſe any thing that is Printed? Or becauſe a Silver Smith could make Shrines for <hi>Diana,</hi> therefore to allow of no ſuch Art.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This Argument lies as hard againſt the common way of Singing; for they pretend to Sing the Tunes of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Its a very ſtrange thing that our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers had no ſenſe of this Danger and Hazard, but that after they were come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Country, they ſhould turn the Pſalms into new Metre, and Annex Rules to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

Object. 2. <hi>The very Original of this way was from the Papiſts. It came from Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. I deny not but the Goſpel it ſelf came from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>England;</hi> we know it did ſo, and its very probable that Singing came along with the Goſpel. I know not of any other coming from Rome but that. And if we muſt reject Regular Singing on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, we muſt by the ſame reaſon reject the Goſpel too. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. As for the Original of Muſick, That was before ever there was a Papiſt, or a Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the World. It was in great Requeſt, and Flouriſhed much in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s time; <hi>David</hi> himſelf was excellently Skilled in Muſick, and ſo were many others in his time. And it is plain it was in uſe in <hi>Moſes</hi>'s time, and probably known and uſed before the Flood. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Suppoſe ſome Papiſt has writ about it, and the Papiſts make uſe of the Art of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick in Singing, its very probable it is ſo, and its no ſolid Objection againſt the uſe of it. There is no reaſon to reject a thing becauſe a Papiſt has delivered it. If an Angel ſhould Preach falſhood we ought to reject it. And in caſe a Papiſt or a Devil ſhould utter a Truth its not to be rejected. Its very true that the Papiſts have horrible Errors &amp; Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:003006_0026_0FEF9BED4315B7F8"/>in Religion, &amp; that both in Doctrine and Practice; yet many of them are learned Men, and write well about various Arts and Sciences, and Practice well in ſome things. And if we reject every thing that the Papiſts hold and do, we muſt reject a great many things that are plain Duties in Religion. Its enough that we reject what is Ill, and as for what is True and Good we ſhould ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it, and embrace it, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Papiſts do hold or practice it <hi>Phil.</hi> 4 8, <hi>Whatſoever things are True,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But,</p>
            <p n="4">4. To take off the force of this Objection, the Guides that we follow in this Affair, are Miniſters or Learned Men of our own Country or Perſwaſion.</p>
            <p>Object. 3 <hi>This way of Singing we uſe in the Country is more Solemn, and therefore much more Suitable and Becoming.</hi>
