            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PRINTER to the READER.</head>
            <p>THE Manuſcript Copy of this Tranſlation of <hi>Cato's Moral Diſtichs,</hi> happened into my Hands ſome Time ſince, and being my ſelf extreamly pleaſed with it, I thought it might be no leſs acceptable to the Publick; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determined to print it as ſoon as I ſhould have conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient Leiſure and Opportunity. It was done by a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man amongſt us (whoſe Name or Character I am ſtrictly forbid to mention, tho' it might give ſome Advantage to my Edition) for the Uſe of his own Children; But in my Opinion, it is no unfit or unprofitable Entertainment for thoſe of riper Years. For certainly, ſuch excellent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of Morality, contain'd in ſuch ſhort and eaſily-remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd Sentences, may to Youth particularly be very ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the Conduct of Life, ſince there can ſcarce happen any Affair of Importance to us, in which we may need Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but one or more of theſe Diſtichs ſuited to the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:003884_0003_10020D9DE6B01550"/>will ſeaſonably occur to the Memory, if the Book has been read and ſtudied with a proper Care and Attention.</p>
            <p>When I obtained Leave to make this Publication, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured alſo the following Account of the Author and his Work: for I thought ſomething of the kind neceſſary to be prefix'd to it.</p>
            <p>In moſt Places that I am acquainted with, ſo great is the preſent Corruption of Manners, that a Printer ſhall find much more Profit in ſuch Things as flatter and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage Vice, than in ſuch as tend to promote its contrary. It would be thought a Piece of Hypocriſy and phariſaical Oſtentation in me, if I ſhould ſay, that I print theſe <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichs</hi> more with a View to the Good of others than my own private Advantage: And indeed I cannot ſay it; for I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I have ſo great Confidence in the common Virtue and Good Senſe of the People of this and the neighbouring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, that I expect to ſell a very good Impreſſion.</p>

            <head>Some ACCOUNT of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Piece, and Conjectures concerning its AUTHOR.</head>
            <p>THO' the Original of theſe Moral Diſtichs, by being put into the Hands of Boys of the lower Forms at the Latin School, have been frequently conſidered as an Entertainment ſuitable only to ſuch childiſh Years; yet great and able Judges have conceived a much more honourable Eſteem of them. They have been commented on by divers Authors, but particularly by <hi>Eraſmus:</hi> They were tranſlated into Greek by <hi>Maximus Planudes,</hi> a native of <hi>Greece,</hi> and one of the moſt learned of his Age. But the great <hi>Joſeph Scaliger,</hi> diſſatisfyed with that Performance, gave another moſt elegant Verſion of them into the ſame Language, which has been divers times printed. And tho' a Critic in that Tongue, on viewing the Verſion, would not eaſily be induced to believe it could be better'd, yet it has been twice ſince attempted by two other ſeveral Hands, mentioned by <hi>Fabricius.</hi> So that at leaſt four Greek Tranſlations of them have appeared. Into the European Languages, as French, Italian, Dutch, there have been many Tranſlations, and into each of them by ſeveral Hands. They have alſo been divers Times render'd into our own; but the Author of this never ſaw any of them, that by <hi>Charles Hoole,</hi> made in plain and low Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage for the Uſe of School-boys, only excepted; and therefore he knows not but they may have been much better done before: But as he intended them (as th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> are here finiſhed) ſolely for the Uſe of his own Children, with ſome of their Acquaintance, and never for publick View, he is no way ſolicitous what others may have perform'd, provided theſe as they are, will anſwer the End they were intended for. Thoſe who find Fault with them may try to do better on any Score of them together, and then they will be more capable of judging, whether it is a very eaſy Task throughout the
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:003884_0005_10020DA14743AA38"/>whole, to comprize the Senſe of two Latin Hexameters in twenty Syllables in Engliſh, with a ſmooth Cadence, and tagg'd with a ſtrong Rhime.</p>
            <p>Of the Author of theſe <hi>Diſtichs</hi> there have been various Sentiments; they are call'd <hi>Cato's,</hi> but they could neither be the Work of the Cenſor, the elder of that Name, nor of the much greater Man the younger, call'd <hi>Uticenſis</hi> from the Place of his Death: For in theſe Verſes, <hi>Virgil, Macer, Ovid,</hi> and <hi>Lucan,</hi> are mention'd, none of whom wrote till after the Death of both theſe <hi>Cato's.</hi> The firſt of the Antients whoſe Works remain, that appears to have known them, is one <hi>Vindicianus</hi> a Phyſician, who in a Letter to the Emperor <hi>Valentinian</hi> the elder, about the Year 370, quotes one of theſe Lines: And in a Gloſſary printed at the end of the <hi>Autores L. Latinae,</hi> ſaid to be <hi>Iſidore</hi>'s, who died about the Year 630, the uncommon Word <hi>Officipedi</hi> is found, and <hi>Cato</hi> is expreſsly quoted for it as an Author; which Word [in another Declenſion] is met with in the 4th Book, Numb. 42 of theſe Diſtichs</p>
            <p>Some have thought him a later Chriſtian Writer; but for the Reaſons given he could not be late, nor could he be a Chriſtian; for no Chriſtian would have been Author of that Diſtich, <hi>Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Cum ſis ipſe nocens moritur cur Victima pro te?</l>
               <l>

            </q>
            <p>Since this is directly repugnant to the main Fundamental of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Religion. <hi>Scaliger's</hi> Opinion, upon a due Conſideration of the Stile (which is allow'd by all but <hi>Boxhornius</hi> to be correct and pure) and of all other Circumſtances, ſeems to be the moſt juſt; which is, that he was an unconverted Gentile, and lived about the Times of <hi>Commodus</hi> or <hi>Severus;</hi> that is, towards the beginning of the third Century: To which may be added, that 'tis probable he might be inclin'd to the Doctrine of the <hi>Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagoreans</hi> and <hi>Platoniſts,</hi> which was revived and came much into Repute a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout that Time. But whoever the Author was, notwithſtanding they have a Fault very common with moſt of the Ancients, that is, that there is ſcarce any Order in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
