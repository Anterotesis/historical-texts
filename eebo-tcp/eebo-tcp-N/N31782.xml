            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Thoſe L—yrs, will tell you they do not act of themſelves, but that their Clients order them, which may be the Caſe in Part; but conſider their Practice after Judgment,—they will grant Execution againſt a Man's Goods and Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, Lands and Tenements, ordering the Sheriff to ſell them at all Events, let it ſell for what it will; the She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riff is thereby obliged to ſell, to ſave himſelf; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sheriff can have Time to make the Money of the Man's Eſtate, which is due, the L—yrs will grant what they call a Caſa, for the Reſidue; and by the Time that is returnable, they will have an Eſcape againſt the Sheriff, for not confining the Debtor to Goal, and ſo make a treble Bill of Coſt, before the Firſt has had Time to be ſettled; when the Whole comes to a Concluſion, perhaps they have not raiſed Money to pay one Third Part of the Coſt; well then, the artful L—yr, will ſay to his Client, I have done all in my Power to ſerve you, I have been dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in my Buſineſs for you, and am ſorry Matters have turned out ſo bad, but you ſee I could do no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; you will be ſo kind as to pay the Remainder of the Coſt; and then the Creditor may think himſelf well off it he has not above Fifteen or Twenty Pounds Coſt to pay.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:041951_0007_101B72D8EB32AB88"/>
Now, I would give a Word of Advice to Creditors: You ſee by the above Practices of the Gentlemen of the Law, how artful they are a taking your Money from you; yea, more ſo than the noted Robin Hood, the great Robber; for he would do it to your Face, and let you know what he was about to do; but thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will take it from you ſmiling, and telling of you a fair and plauſible Story: Note, the above Caſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, had the Creditors taken the Debtor's Eſtate, and made the beſt of it, he would have got his Whole Money, and the Debtor left at Freedom; but now you find the Creditor has loſt his Demands, and obliged to pay a conſiderable Coſt, and the poor Debtor in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement.</p>
               <p>So I conclude with this my Advice to you, open your Eyes, and every one ſee for himſelf and his Friend, is the Prayer, of a Friend to the Public in General.</p>

What a pretty Article would it have been to them in a Chriſtian Land, that the Law ſhould have ſecured the Sum, thus obtained by the above ſaid Extortion, for the Relief of thoſe little innocent Ones? when alas! they have now nothing left but Penury and Want.) To number or ſum up the Whole of ſuch Tranſactions and Extortions, that are perpetrated under Pretence of Law, is needleſs, ſince a Letter found at Freehold, in the County of Monmouth, June 21ſt, 1769, will fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the L—yrs Abominations, which, if not timely prevented, will be the Caſe of Hundreds of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in this County; theſe crying and abominable Practices, as is ſet forth in the aforeſaid Letter, are at this Time thoroughly known by the major Part of the County. For Heaven's Sake! Can it be thought, that the wiſe and merciful Creator, made a few Men to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern as Gods, and the reſt of Mankind to be governed as Beaſts? The Almighty has form'd us, to get our Bread by the Sweat of our Brow, and he that doth it not, is a uſeleſs Member, and ought to be turned out of Society, which are the L—yrs.</p>
               <p>And now my dear Countrymen, what Heart that is human, or is not as hard as an Adamant, would not melt to hear the Diſtreſſes and Cries in our Land? and not be moved to put down ſuch idle Drones from prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing, until there is a thorough Regulation in the Law? and that the Law may be made ſo legible, that we may do without theſe Drones, or may prevent them for ever from their unconſcionable Practices any more! And now my brave Countrymen ariſe, and let us

               <p>For Prevention whereof, we the Public of ſaid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in general, do ſincerely, abſolutely, and bonefide, engage to defend ourſelves and each other, in Purſuit of a thorough Regulation, againſt every Practitioner of the Law or his Deputy, or Subſtitute, that doth or ſhall practiſe in this County; and prevent their perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating any Suit as aforeſaid, or hereafter, in ſaid Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, by turning him or them out of ſaid Country, King's Buſineſs only excepted; we do hereby promiſe that we will not diſturb ſuch Suits, upon the Account of the Peace of Society, and good Order of Government; but do acknowledge a true and faithful Allegiance to his Majeſty, GEORGE the Third, and do ſincerely engage to defend him with our Lives and Fortunes; and by theſe Preſents do hope and pray, that every true Lover of his Country, will appear early the firſt Day of July Term next, at Monmouth Court Houſe, there to prevent any more of our Countrymen, and their Families from Ruin, until our Complaints be heard and our Grievances be redreſſed.</p>

Thirdly, I ſhall now give an Account how Matters were carried on at the Court. The Evening before the Court, there was a Liberty Pole ſet up, with a Union Flag at the Head of ſaid Pole. Tueſday the 25th of July, it being the firſt Day of the Court, there was no leſs than two or three Hundred Liberty Boys, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared under ſaid Flag, in Defiance of the Gentlemen called La—yrs; the Court being called, the Court with the Grand-Jury, were admitted peaceably to enter the Court-Houſe, but no La—yrs were admitted to go in; upon which the Court made Propoſals to the Public, with Aſſurances, that they would redreſs the Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of the People, as far as lay in their Power; which in ſome Meaſure appeaſed the People, but could not fully conſent to make Way for the Lawyers to enter the Court-Houſe. Wedneſday the 26th Day of July in the Morning, it was again warmly inſiſted upon, by the Court Party, that the Liberty Pole ſhould be taken down; a Gentleman of ſaid County, aſſerted to the People, that the Lawyers had given up the Point, and would not ſeek for an Opportunity to enter the Court; upon which in Obedience to the Court, the Pole was taken down, and all Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I think it is highly neceſſary to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Public, what was the moving Cauſe of the Oppoſition made by the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of ſaid County, againſt the Gentlemen called L—yrs; at our Court held in ſaid County, on Tueſday the 25th July, the Inhabitants of ſaid County, having long laboured under great Oppreſſion, ariſing from ſome of the aforeſaid Men, of which, I ſhall mention one Inſtance, tho' many more of the like Kind might be proved; one of the ſaid Gentlemen finding that a Shop-keeper, of ſaid County, was indebted to a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in New-York, the ſaid Gentleman (tho' not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of that Character) informed the Merchant, that if he did not immediately puſh for his Money, he would be very likely to loſe it; upon which, the Creditor put the Debtor's Bond in the Lawyer's Charge; the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer yer ſent to the Debtor that he had ſuch a Bond, and that if he did not put Bonds and Accounts in his Hands ſufficient to diſcharge the Debt, that he muſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſue him; upon which the Debtor put between 40 and 50 Bills of Accounts, in ſaid Lawyer's Hands, by an Agreement, that they ſhould not be ſued upon, until after the next Court; but the ungrateful Lawyer, violated the Agreement, and before the Court, granted Writs for all the above cited Bills and Accounts, and alſo for the Shop-keeper himſelf; this with many ſuch like Practices might be prov'd.</p>

The Second Oppreſſion ariſing from the ſaid Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, is the many unwarrantable Bills of Coſts made by many of them, which was fully prov'd, at the Court aforeſaid; the Inhabitants under the aforeſaid Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, were determined to ſhew the Court, their Diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of ſuch Proceedings; upon which the Court, with the Public, agreed upon amicable Terms, and all Animoſities to be laid aſide; but by a miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſome Perſons, when the Court was called, ſaid Perſons pretended ſtill to oppoſe the ſaid Lawyers, which cauſed ſome conſiderable Confuſion for a few Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, but when fully underſtood by both Sides was alſo dropped for the Preſent; I mention the above Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the aforeſaid Gentlemen, and alſo the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Court, to ſhew the Creditors of the People in ſaid County, that it was not with a Deſign to defraud them, but that it was much the contrary. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the above Commotions, a few Bills of Coſts were laid before the Court, off of which, there were above one Hundred Pounds docked; if my Information be right, there is ſo much ſaved for Creditors, and I doubt not, but in the Term of a few Years, it will prove, that there will be many Thouſands of Pounds ſaved for the Uſe of Creditors as aforeſaid.</p>
