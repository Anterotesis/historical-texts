            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE</hi> importance of the ſubject which I take the liberty to dedicate to you, particularly that part rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the treatment and prevention of Yellow Fever, and other Diſeaſes which have their origin, and are in general denominated contagious, has engaged the attention of ſeveral learned and ingenious men, who have attempted to deviſe means to remedy the evil, with a penetration and zeal which muſt ever do them honour. It will not, I truſt, therefore be deemed preſumptuous in me, to collect thoſe important and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable diſcoveries together, ſo as to make them more univerſally known, and their application more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and extenſively uſeful amongſt that claſs of men,

who have not at all times an opportunity of calling in medical aid. In confidence that the utility of the meaſure; its connection with the health and comfort of thoſe valuable citizens, who brave the danger of the ſeas, encounter various hardſhips, and are expoſed to the diſeaſes of unhealthy climes, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the conveniences and luxuries of the different parts of the globe, will entitle me to your candid attention; and thoſe readers who feel an intereſt in whatever may contribute to the removal of miſery.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>DAILY experience affords ſuch numerous and melancholy inſtances of the fatal effects of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious diſeaſes, and others more immediately within the power of medicine to remove, as render every attempt to mitigate their violence intereſting to the Community at large, and the United States in particular. It is ſcarce neceſſary to place before our Readers <hi>facts,</hi> in order to excite their attention to the ſubject: Lately in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, calamity itſelf has been the conſtant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of every neighbourhood; and almoſt every news-paper preſents us with an example of the direful conſequences of infection. From this malignant ſource it is, that the late awful and melancholy events in our cities are principally to be attributed, and that our ſhips become ſcenes of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution;—the enterpriſing Mariner—the hardy Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier—the induſtrious Citizen (all entitled to the care and gratitude of a mercantile and riſing republic) are daily victims to the unſuſpected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of contagion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:048383_0006_1025501E4265AD90"/>IN contemplating the ſubject of noxious va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, it ſtruck me forcibly that ſome ſervice might be rendered to the public, and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable improvements made by turning my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the ſubject of medicine-cheſts for naval, travelling, or domeſtic uſe, particularly the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, by pointing out the means that are known by repeated experiments to poſſeſs the power of deſtroying contagion, cleanſing infected ſubſtances, and preventing the propagation of diſeaſes, which I have never ſeen ſufficiently attended to in any book of directions of this kind; beſides the diſcovery of the means for that purpoſe, which are communicated in the following ſheets, are of a very recent date, and not yet generally practiſed.</p>
            <p>WHAT avail the nobleſt remedies that nature and art have produced for the cure of thoſe dreadful maladies, without deviſing and applying means to deſtroy the <hi>Fons et origo mali,</hi> (fountain and origin of evil,) and reſtore the purity of the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere in which the patient breathes, by removing the cauſes which might ſubject him to a fatal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe.—Dr. Lind obſerves, "Wherever infection lurks, and in whatever it is harboured, the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the pureſt air, or the moſt perfect ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilation will often not avail either in removing or abating its activity." It is to the perſevering
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:048383_0007_10254FDEE9D9CE60"/>
and unremitting attention to the beſt intereſts of mankind, that we are indebted to the ingenious Drs. Carmichael Smith, Prieſtly, Ingenhouz, Beddoes, Mitchill, and others of great eminence; particularly the former gentleman for his import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant diſcovery, for arreſting and ſtopping the progreſs of contagious diſeaſes, by a ſimple ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in chemiſtry, which is in the power of every one to perform at a minutes notice.</p>
            <p>As perfect ventilation and the free admiſſion of pure air, is not always practicable on board of ſhips, occaſionally the uſe of ſteam will be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, by which a large portion of water being converted into vapour, which the air having a greater affinity to than for any foreign matter float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in it; a compleat exchange will take place, all the noxious particles will be decompoſed, the diſagreeable ſtench or foetor ariſing from foul or diſeaſed bodies will be precipitated, and the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere of the patient rendered pure.</p>
            <p>A COMPLEAT ſyſtem of the practice of phyſic and ſurgery cannot be expected in the compaſs of theſe directions; neither is it intended to preclude the propriety of calling in proper medical aid, when it can be had.</p>
            <p>As the medicine-cheſts will be equally porta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and not more expenſive by the additional
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:048383_0008_1025501FF8940240"/>
means here recommended; they will of courſe, be rendered more extenſively uſeful. In ſhort, if I ſhould be fortunate enough in this inſtance to contribute in the ſmalleſt degree to the health and comfort of Society, I ſhall think myſelf amply rewarded.</p>

               <hi>MEDICAL ADVICE</hi>; Particularly to thoſe who travel to the various regions of the Globe.</head>
            <p>IT is of the utmoſt importance for every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, to well underſtand the beſt methods of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving health, and is the duty of every well-wiſher to the cauſe of humanity, to contribute his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; on this principle then the following direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are written.</p>
            <p>IN hot weather, after uſing any hard exerciſe, avoid drinking cold water, for it has proved fatal: but as drink is abſolutely neceſſary, the water ſhould be mixed with about one ſeventh or eight of good old ſpirits. To thoſe who are relaxed, nothing can be better than an addition to this drink of about twelve drops of acid elixir of vitriol, three or four times a day, or a ſmall quantity of the juice of lemons or limes: but the moſt wholeſome beverage for them who enjoy a good ſtate of health, is good ſound porter or ale mixed with water.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:048383_0010_102550281DE80D38"/>EXCESSES of every kind ſhould be avoided as much as poſſible, and drunkenneſs in particular. No perſon ſhould ſleep at night in the open air, as it is extremely hazardous, on account of the damps.</p>
            <p>IT is ſtrongly recommended to the commanders of ſhips trading to the different parts of Africa, the Eaſt, and Weſt Indies, not to permit any of their men to remain on ſhore after ſunſet.—But if from buſineſs, of any other unavoidable circumſtance, they ſhould be ſent in boats, up rivers, or on ſhore in the neighbourhood of marſhy countries, a few large doſes of bark in powder, given in wine, may enable the conſtitution to reſiſt the ſedative power of the chilling and noxious damps.—Or a few doſes of the ague pills, which are a very powerful tonic, will anſwer ſtill better in places, where from the rain and fogs, the conſtitution may be ſaid to be conſtantly in a vapour bath.</p>
            <p>IN order to prevent injuries from the bite of <hi>muſquetoes, horſe-flies,</hi> and other inſects, as they ſometimes produce inflammations and ulcers in the legs, and even mortifications; wear long light linen trowſers. The beſt remedy for the inflammation ariſing from theſe cauſes, is the juice of a lime, ſharp vinegar, Goulard's extract of lead and water, or ſpirit of harts-horn and water.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:048383_0011_10254FE4E9E88400"/>WHEN the water is bad or putrid, it may be ſweetened in the following manner: Expoſe it to the air as much as poſſible, by pumping it with a hand pump from one veſſel into another, mixing a little powdered charcoal or a ſmall por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of alum, which will throw down particles of dirt, clear the water, and its wholeſomeneſs will not be in the ſlighteſt degree impaired.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. OTSBRIDGE's method of ſweetening ſuch water is the quickeſt, which is by paſſing it through a ſeries of veſſels, placed under each other, having very ſmall holes bored in their bottoms, ſo that it may fall in ſmall drops, like a gentle ſhower of rain, through each of them into a receiver fixed below. The wind, or air, having thus a free paſſage through the water, divided into ſmall drops, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            </p>
            <p>IN long voyages, beef, pork, &amp;c. is frequently apt to become ſtale.—"In Mr. Gaine's almanac for 1797, there is a good Receipt, by which any meat, ever ſo ſtinking, may be made as ſweet and wholeſome in a few minutes, as any meat at all. The Receipt is as follows: Take ſome white ley, that is, boil ſome clean aſhes in water; let it ſtand till it ſettles; pour this off as clear as rock water; boil your meat in this three or four minutes, or till it is ſweet, then waſh it and dreſs it in any way, and no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon could diſcover it had ever been foetid or ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This will be found a uſeful communication to the navy, where a ſolution of pot-aſh may be uſed inſtead of the white ley."</p>

When this bladder breaks, the head of the worm is to be ſecured, by tying it to a ſmall roll of linen, ſpread with plaiſter; and part of the worm is once or twice a day to be gently drawn forth, with care not to break it, and wrapped round this roll, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til it be brought away entire; then the ulcer gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally heals ſoon; but if part of the worm breaks off, the part remaining in the fleſh, can be ejected only by painful and tedious ſuppuration in different places. Dr. Rouppe obſerves, that the Guinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worm is infectious. It may at leaſt be prudent, not to lie in the ſame apartment, and to avoid too free a communication with ſuch negroes as are afflicted with them."</p>
            <p>BEFORE we proceed to give directions how to exhibit the medicines contained in the medicine-cheſt, our attention ſhall be directed to the means pointed out by Dr. Lind, for preventing a want of proviſions at ſea, and cloſe our remarks with ſome general obſervations reſpecting diet, more properly adapted to domeſtic uſe.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:048383_0014_1025502B248C7DB8"/>"THE ſubſtances I have found moſt fit for the purpoſe are powder of ſalep and portable ſoup, which convey the greateſt quantity of vegetable and animal nouriſhment under the ſmalleſt bulk. An ounce of powdered ſalep, and another of portable ſoup, diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in two quarts of boiling water, become a rich thick jelly, capable of receiving any flavour from the addition of ſpices. This is ſufficient for one man a day; two pounds of each would ſerve him a month: and being a mixture of both animal and vegetable food, it is more wholeſome than either uſed alone. Haſſelquiſt informs us, that a cara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van from Ethiopia to Egypt, having expended their proviſions, lived for two months on gum arabic, diſſolved in water; this gum having luckily been a part of their merchandize. The gum ſenega or ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic, ſerves as a ſuſtenance for whole negro towns, during a ſcarcity of other proviſions, occaſioned by a failure of their crops of millet and rice.</p>
            <p>SPICES render portable ſoup and ſalep, more grateful to the palate, and alſo tend to improve their nutritive quality; as would appear from the following incident of famine on board a ſhip at ſea: A Malay ſhip arrived from Macaſſar, at Manilla, which by the ſhifting of the monſoon, had been detained at ſea much longer than was expected, the men had been reduced to ſuch extremities for want

               <p>PERSONS of imflammatory diſpoſition, cannot uſe vegetables too plentifully. Oat-meal is cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, therefore made into gruel, affords a light and proper diet for the ſick, ſo are ſago, ſimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, and tapioca, uſed in general, in various diſeaſes, where ſuch diet is neceſſary; and in all fevers, where animal food ſhould be generally avoided. From the fineſt wheat flour is made macaroni, vermicelle, &amp;c. as they are called in Italy, which may be boiled in water, and affords excellent nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>THOSE whoſe health is impaired, would do well to be cautious in the choice of their food; veal, poultry, mutton well boiled, and fiſh are extremely nutritive, oyſters eaten from the ſhell are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent.</p>

                        <p>THE eminent Dr. Clark's method of treating this fever, as it appeared in Dominica in the year 1793,—1796, as communicated in the annals of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, 1797, is ſo perfectly rational and ſucceſsful, we ſhall here give a few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts.</p>
                        <p>DR. C. obſerves, that in general, few recovered who had a cold fit at the beginning of the fever. If the yellowneſs appeared in twenty four hours, or if the patients had been bled, they never recovered, unleſs by the aid of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful remedies acting in an evident and deciſive manner. Dr. C's method of cure, is to ſubdue the febrile ſtage, by the moſt ſpeedy means, and prevent the putreſcent ſtate;—he obſerves, that although there were ſome appearances which might ſeem to indicate blood-letting, yet it had very generally pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous effects. The French practitioners, with whom blood-letting is a remedy in all diſeaſes, erred much in this particular; and aſſure us, that there was not a ſingle inſtance of an emigrant recovering who had been bled in this diſeaſe. He allows that in young athletic people, ſeized with this fever ſoon after their arrival in the Weſt-Indies, bleeding may to a certain degree, be of uſe, if performed during the firſt twenty-four hours from the attack, but if uſed after that period, or at moſt after thirty-ſix hours, it will always be found prejudicial, if not fatal.—In the treatment Dr. C. in general, firſt ordered pediluvium, or bathing the feet in warm water, and a purging cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, to moderate the determination to the head. After this, purging was the chief means employed to moderate the fever. But he found it very difficult to procure this evacuation by common purgatives. He recommends the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing form, as the moſt efficacious.</p>
                        <p>Take of powder of jalap, two ſcruples,</p>
                        <p>Calomel, one ſcruple,</p>
                        <p>Oil of mint, four drops,</p>
                        <p>Water ſufficient to make them into ſixteen pills, of theſe pills, ſix or eight were given as ſpeedily as poſſible, with a cupful of cold mint or cinnamon tea, and two or three more repeated every hour, till they operated. If theſe were rejected by vomiting, ten grains of calomel formed into two pills, were admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered immediately, and repeated in four hours, if they had not operated plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully before that time.</p>
                        <p>AFTER the purgatives had operated ſufficiently, if the head ache was not relieved, a bliſter was applied to the neck; perſpiration was encouraged, by giving warm drinks; and three or four grains of calomel was given in a pill, every four or ſix hours. To this opium was ſometimes added, (twenty or thirty drops of the tincture) when the purging had a tendency to run to exceſs.</p>
                        <p>A BLISTER applied over the ſtomach, generally checked the vomiting, when employed early in the diſeaſe. When there was little or no inclination to vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, Dr. C. added a proportion, viz. from half a grain to one or two grains of the antimonial powder (No. 27) to the calomel; and pills with this combination were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven every ſecond or third hour, till they had ſome effect. A grain or two of opium, or twenty five to thirty five drops of the tincture was afterwards given, to ſettle the ſtomach and procure ſleep. If the medicine operated plentifully by ſtool before the opium was adminiſtered, and a profuſe perſpiration followed, the fever was carried off in twenty four hours, and the patient recovered. The antimonial when conjoined with calomel, rarely occaſioned vomiting, their effects were commonly to procure a few ſtools, and to excite perſpiration. And although vomiting in this fever is very much to be dreaded, yet in all caſes conſidered as deſperate, this combination ought to be tried.</p>
                        <p>AFTER the febrile ſtage, three or four grains of calomel were given every four hours to an adult, and a glaſs of ſtrong decoction of bark, was ordered every hour in the intervals, with as much nouriſhment and wine as the ſtomach could bear, given in ſmall quantities frequently repeated. This plan was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for thirty-ſix or forty-eight hours after the febrile ſtate was over a ſlight ſalivation or ſpitting rarely took place; but the gums we are told, were ſometimes a little aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           </gap>cted about the third day. When that happened, both mercury and every other remedy was ſuſpended, and nouriſhment and wine only given.</p>
                        <p>Dr. C's method of prevention is on arrival a few calomel purges, in the courſe of the firſt ten days, with a vegetable diet, and the moderate uſe of wine, together with peruvian bark for ſeveral days after, and the renewal of the calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel purges and bark from time to time, during the firſt two or three months reſidence, was the moſt common method employed to prevent an attack, and it was generally ſucceſsful.</p>

                  <p>FRACTURES are of various kinds, viz. Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, oblique, and longitudinal. When a bone is ſplit into ſmall pieces, it is ſaid to be ſplintered, they are alſo diſtinguiſhed by different names; thus, when the ſoft parts remain ſound, the fracture is denominated ſimple; when attended with a wound, communicating with the fracture, it is termed compound. Fractures are diſcovered by the eye, the ear, and the touch. The ſymptoms are pain, ſwelling, and tenſion in the contiguous parts; a more or leſs crooked and diſtorted ſtate of the limb, a crackling or grating noiſe on the parts being
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:048383_0048_1025505D2776C880"/>
handled, and loſs of power to a certain extent in the injured limb.</p>
                  <p>THE indications of cure, are to replace the parts of the bone that have been removed from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſituation, to retain them in this ſituation as long as may be neceſſary. In order to replace the parts of the bones, a ſlight degree of extenſion may be employed by the upper part of the limb, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kept firm by an aſſiſtant with his hands placed between the fracture and the contiguous joint, while the under part of it is gently extended by another, obſerving to keep the muſcles as much relaxed as poſſible. If there is very great tenſion and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, they muſt be removed before the replacing of the bone is attempted, by the means recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in bruiſes, ſprains, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>TO retain the bones when replaced, compreſſes, bandages, and a relaxed ſtate of the limb till the cure is compleated, are neceſſary. The bandage muſt not be applied with more tightneſs than is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to retain the bones in their ſituation, a linen or flannel roller is the beſt for this purpoſe. In a healthy middle aged perſon, a ſimple fracture of the thigh, or bones of the leg, will require about two months for the cure. The humerus and bones of the forearm about ſix weeks; the collar bone, ribs, and bones of the fingers and toes, hands and feet, about three weeks. In infancy, the cure is effected in leſs time, but in old age the proceſs is more ſlow; to reduce the fracture of the collar bone, it is
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:048383_0049_1025508AEEE87FC8"/>
only neceſſary to raiſe the arm, and ſupport it at a proper height; which is done by a ſling round the neck, adapted to the length of the arm, and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed equally to every part of it—the bones are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally united in a fortnight; but the correſponding arm ſhould not be uſed until the end of the third or fourth week.</p>
                  <p>FRACTURES of the ribs, are diſcovered by the ſeat of the pain, and by preſſure of the fingers. In general the ſymptoms are moderate, but in ſome inſtances the pain is ſevere from the firſt, the breathing is difficult, attended with cough and ſometimes ſpitting of blood; the pulſe is quick, full, and ſometimes oppreſſed. In every caſe of fractured ribs, bleed proportionably to the ſtrength of the patient. If any inequality is diſcovered, let the patient make a deep inſpiration, and by equal and moderate preſſure, endeavour to replace it; and to prevent its riſing, apply a broad roller, or a leather belt quilted inſide, with cotton or flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, moderately tight, and let it be worn for ſeveral weeks—the diet muſt be low.</p>

                     <p>N. B. IF the pipe of the bellows will not enter the noſtril, a piece of ſtiff paper, or leather, may be rolled up in the ſhape of a funnel, and the ſmaller end put into the noſtril, while the other receives the pipe of the bellows.—Or if bellows are not at hand, blow into the lungs through ſuch a tube, or through a quill, reed, or other ſmall pipe, with your breath.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. WHEN breathing begins, touch the inſide of the noſtrils, with a feather dipt in ſpirir of hartſhorn or ſharp muſtard; or blow ſome pepper into them. A glyſter ſhould now be given without delay, compoſed of a pint of warm water mixed with a ſixth part of rum, brandy, or gin, or with a large table ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of ſpirit of hartſhorn, or eſſence of peppermint, or a heaped teaſpoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p n="5">5. As ſoon as the patient can ſwallow, give him by ſpoonfuls, a little warm wine, or ſpirits <hi>mixed with water.</hi>

                     <p n="6">6. WHEN life is completely reſtored, the ſufferer ſhould remain at reſt in a warm bed; be ſupplied with warm wine whey, ale, poſſet, or other nouriſhing drinks; and gentle ſweating ſhould be encouraged.</p>
                     <p>N. B. Theſe attentions ſhould be continued until the patient is out of all danger, ſeveral perſons having been loſt from being quitted too ſoon.</p>
                     <p>No more than <hi>ſix</hi> perſons to be admitted into the room; a greater number ſerving only to ſpoil the air and to create confuſion and miſtakes.</p>

                        <hi>Hanging.</hi>—1. If a medical perſon be preſent, let him take a few ounces of blood from the jugular veins, or apply cupping-glaſſes to the neck.</p>

                        <hi>Suffocation by Noxious Vapours.</hi>—2. If the body be hot, ſtrip and lay it in the open air, with the head and ſhoulders raiſed. Then daſh cold water upon it, until ſigns of life appear; taking care that none get into the mouth or noſtrils. At the ſame time blow into the lungs as ordered in drowned perſons.—If the body has grown cold, then warmth muſt be applied.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Froſt-bitten, or Frozen.</hi>—At firſt rub the parts affected, or the whole body with ſnow; or waſh them with cold water;—but not near a fire, or in a warm place; it being of great conſequence that the heat be communicated very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually.—If the breathing has ſtopped, blow into the lungs as already deſcribed: and when recovery takes place, be cautious of giving ſpiritous liquors, except in very ſmall quantities, and well lowered with water.</p>

                        <hi>Still-born, or Smothered under Bed-clothes.</hi>—1. In caſes of ſtill-birth, fill the lungs with air, by blowing into the noſtril or mouth through a quill, then gently preſs the cheſt with the hand; and repeat this till natural breathing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins.—Alſo rub the body gently with the warm hand, before a fire; put it into the warm bath; or wrap it in flannels well wrung out of water moderately warmed;and ſtimulate the noſtrils with ſpirit of hartſhorn or muſtard.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When a child has been ſmothered in bed by overlaying, &amp;c. if (as is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the caſe) the body be too hot, expoſe it immediately to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>No other means than thoſe here recommended, are ever to be uſed, except under the immediate direction of a medical gentleman; but the above means are to be continued <hi>ſix</hi> hours, if needful.</p>

the ſtomach. If the patient ſeems plethoric, and more particularly if the diſeaſe has been occaſioned by hanging, bleeding ſhould be employed, and that as one of the firſt remedies; nor ſhould the
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:048383_0053_10255090D5EC2EC0"/>
application of a proper degree of warmth be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected. Bottles with hot water, or bricks heated, wrapped in a blanket, ſhould be laid to the bottom of the feet; the joints of the knees, and under the arm-pits. Freſh air ſhould be carefully admitted into the place where he lays. If an electrical ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine, is at hand, gentle ſhocks may be directed through the fourth or fifth rib of the left ſide. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flate the lungs by blowing air into them by a curved pipe if one can be had, otherwiſe by a perſon blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing air into the lungs, and preſſing it out again, ſo as to imitate natural reſpiration. Electricity ſhould never be employed on any account, without a concomitant expanſion of the lungs. Tobacco, in any form is highly pernicious, and ought not therefore to be applied on any account.</p>
               <p>INFLATING the lungs, electrifying the heart, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing the lungs, and the application of frictions, are to be continued four hours, if our endeavours be not previouſly crowned with ſucceſs. Frictions ſhould never be employed before the lungs have been ſeveral times expanded and collapſed. A little common oil or lard as a medium for the fric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is preferable to either ſalt or ſpirits, or any other ſtimulating ſubſtance. The above methods of reſtoring life are applicable to various other cauſes of apparent death, whether from fits, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focation by damps, or noxious vapours, from the confined air of wells, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>P. S. FOR making the common bread poultice, water is decidedly preferable to milk.</p>
