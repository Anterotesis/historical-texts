            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Obſervation on the Articles of Confederation,</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>BY theſe Articles, it clearly appears to have been intended by the Parties, that Congreſs ſhould be the ſupreme ſovereign Power, in all Caſes, and that their Acts and Proceedings ſhould be ſupremely efficacious, as much as any ſovereign Acts whatſoever.—Some Perſons may imagine, that no Acts can be Sovereign Acts, without a King, as in Great-Britain, and other Nations ruled by Kings; but it is not the Name or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a King, which makes him the Sovereign, or which makes his Acts ſupreme and abſolute, but he becomes ſovereign, and his Acts become ſupreme, by the Conſtitution, or by the People aſſenting to his poſſeſſing and exerciſing the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and ſupreme Power.—It is very plain, that a free People, of any Nation or Country, may lodge the ſovereign and ſupreme Authority, for their own Government, in a Number or Body of Men, without Regard to a King, or the Name of a King, or any ſingle Perſon.—It was accordingly meant by the Parties to the Articles of Confederation, that Congreſs ſhould poſſeſs and exerciſe the ſovereign and ſupreme Power over all the United States in Confederation; and that without ſuch Poſſeſſion and Exerciſe, the Union and Confederation of the States muſt be defective and incomplete.</p>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>A few Remarks, taken from the Britiſh Union, may be of Uſe, to caſt ſome Light on the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Articles of Union.—In the Union between England and Scotland, the Scotch retained their former Laws and their former Courts of Juſtice; but after the Union, their Laws were to be all made in the Parliament of Great-Britain; for it would be inconſiſtent with the Idea of a complete Union, under one Legiſlature, of King, Lords, and Commons, legiſlating at Weſtminſter, that the Scotch ſhould, at Home, ſtill be their own Legiſlators, as before the Union; and though they conſidered that the King, Lords, and Commons, compoſing the Legiſlature of England, were, by their Conſtitution, as abſolute, and might, on Occaſions, be as arbitrary and oppreſſive as the Grand Turk; and that after the Union, and even after the Acceſſion of ſixty-one Members, ſixteen Lords, and forty-five Commoners from Scotland, the Britiſh Legiſlature would ſtill, by their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, be as abſolute as before, and might, on Occaſions, be oppreſſive; they nevertheleſs, for the Sake of a complete and conſiſtent Union, choſe to have their Repreſentatives in the Britiſh Parliament, and to have their Laws, in Time to come, from that Parliament; ſtipulating at the ſame Time, that Laws concerning the Regulation of Trade, Cuſtoms, and Exciſe, were to be the ſame in Scotland as in England; but all other Laws in Uſe in Scotland, were to remain in Force after the Union, but alterable by the Parliament of Great-Britain; and that Laws concerning public
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:020600_0004_0FB05148799AC7C8"/>
Right, Policy, and civil Government, ſhould be made the ſame throughout the whole united Kingdom, but no Alteration ſhould be made in Laws concerning private Right, except for the evident Utility of the Subjects in Scotland.</p>
            <p>Though the Circumſtances of the Britiſh Union were not ſimilar to the Circumſtances of the American Union, and the Parties in the Britiſh Union were not <hi>in pari Caſu</hi> with the Parties in the American Union, the main Point in the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Union being to ſubject the Scotch to the Parliament of England, to be thereafter compoſed of Engliſh and Scotch; and the Parties to the American Union having no King, Lords, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to be ſubject to, or governed by, yet ſtill the following Remarks, ariſing from the Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Britiſh Union, may be uſeful to ſhow the Defects of the American Union.</p>
            <p n="1">I. If it had been reſerved to the Scotch, in ſome or any particular Caſes or Caſe, to make Regulations for themſelves, after the Union, and that in ſuch particular Caſes reſerved, the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Great-Britain ſhould not interfere; ſuch a Reſervation would have been inconſiſtent with the Union, and ſhould ſoon occaſion much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.</p>
            <p n="2">II. If the Britiſh Treaty for an Union, had only declared an Union generally, and that the King of England ſhould, under ſuch general Union, be the ſole Arbiter of Peace and War, for Scotland as well as England, and that the Scotch ſhould aid and aſſiſt England in all Wars, offenſive
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:020600_0005_0FB0514AA6FB7248"/>
and defenſive; but without infringing or violating the legiſlative Right of Scotland, within its own Limits; ſuch a Stipulation would be extremely abſurd, and would ſoon occaſion much Confuſion, becauſe if any legiſlative Right had been left with Scotland, after the Union, there would have been no End of legiſlating Pretentions, on various Emergencies and Occaſions, nor any preciſe Boundary left between the legiſlative and executive Powers, under the Union.</p>
            <p n="3">III. If the Articles of the Britiſh Union had ſtipulated nothing concerning the Laws for the Regulation of Trade, Cuſtoms, and Exciſe, or the Laws concerning public Right, Policy, and civil Government, and had not enacted that ſuch Laws ſhould, in Time coming, be the ſame in Scotland as in England, this would have occaſioned the utmoſt Confuſion, by Laws for the Regulation of Trade, Cuſtoms, and Exciſe and concerning pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Right, Policy, and civil Government in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, being different from, and claſhing with, or derogatory to thoſe Laws in England.</p>
            <p>So much for Remarks upon the Britiſh Union, as a Kind of Introduction to the following Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on the Articles of the American Union, and thoſe Articles, in a political Senſe, truly appear to be improperly penned, in various Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars herein after obſerved upon:</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Stipulation, that each State retains it's Sovereignty and Independence, &amp;c. (as in Article 1ſt) appears to be wrong. Under the Idea of a political Union of thirteen ſeveral States confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:020600_0006_0FB0514C0E4657B8"/>
together, the Sovereignty of any individual State ought not to have been conſidered or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed to be retained by ſuch individual State, becauſe no Sovereignty ought to be ſuppoſed to exiſt in any individual State after the Union, the only Sovereignty which could be uſeful or of Importance being the United Sovereignty, and of courſe, the whole Sovereignty of the Thirteen United States ought to be lodged with, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centered in the Congreſs, as being the ſupreme Body or Tribunal, conſtituted for the Purpoſe of poſſeſſing the united Sovereignties of the Thirteen ſeveral United States.</p>
            <p n="2">II. If this is juſt, it will appear, that after the Union, no individual State ought to be it's own Legiſlator, but that the Laws of each State ought to be made and paſſed in Congreſs.—Perhaps this would not have been reliſhed by the individual States, at the Time of the Articles of Union entered into; but now, after ſome Experience had under thoſe Articles, during which Experience, various Events are ſaid to have happened, to ſhow the Inconvenience of individual States making their own Laws, <hi>ad Libitum,</hi> without regarding Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; perhaps the individual States will not conſider an Alteration to be made in this Reſpect, either by themſelves or Congreſs, ſeverally or jointly, as any Infringement or Violation of the legiſlative Right of any individual State, but will conſider it as a proper and even neceſſary Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Benefit of the Union, and for render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it more conſiſtent and more complete.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:020600_0007_0FB0514DD34C23C8"/>III. If it is conſidered to be too much for indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual States to give up what is called their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, their legiſlative Right, ſtill they may be willing and ſatisfied to have the Exerciſe of ſuch their ſovereign and legiſlative Rights modi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and abridged, or limited ſo far that no Law or Laws, Regulation or Regulations, to be made by any individual State, in Time coming, ſhall be valid, or of any Force or Effect, without the Aſſent of Congreſs firſt had and interpoſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.—If this Matter is ſuffered to continue, as it was left, under the Articles of Union, it will then be clear, that the individual States of the Union chuſe to keep up an abſurd <hi>Imperium in Imperio,</hi> by individual Sovereignties, and legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Rights, militating againſt, and deſtructive of the Authority of Congreſs, which ought to be the only ſovereign, ſupreme, and abſolute Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, over, in, and throughout every Part of the United States.</p>
            <p>Upon this Head it is unneceſſary to mention the natural Diſtinctions between Laws and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations of one Kind and thoſe of another Kind, between the Laws for the Regulation of Trade, Cuſtoms, and Exciſe, and the Laws concerning public Right, Policy, and civil Government, or to mention that ſuch Laws and Regulations ought to be the ſame every where, throughout the Whole of the United States, becauſe the Thing is plain and obvious; and if the Doctrine above laid down, is applied to the making an Alteration in the Exerciſe of Legiſlation, ſuch Alteration will
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:020600_0008_0FB0514F1D3ED4E8"/>
prevent or remedy the Inconveniencies ariſing from the former Exerciſe of Legiſlation, under the Articles of Union, as well in Regard to Laws for the Regulation of Trade, Cuſtoms, and Exciſe, as Laws concerning public Right, Policy, and civil Government.</p>
            <p>The Caſe that is ſaid to have happened in the State of Maſſachuſetts, after that State had made a Navigation Act, ſubjecting all Foreigners to pay double Duties, a heavy Tonage, and high Light-Money, in the Ports of that State, is a deplorable Inſtance of the Abſurdity of any individual State making Laws for itſelf, for impoſing Duties on Ships and Merchandize, when, in the Ports of other individual States of the Union, no ſuch Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties had been impoſed, or exiſted; and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence was, that every foreign Ship deſtined for the Maſſachuſetts, during the Continuance of the ſaid Duties, went to other Ports, where they could deal to greater Advantage, and thereby Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize of immenſe or very conſiderable Value, which would have been exchanged for the Maſſachuſetts Produce, to the great Increaſe of their Revenue, was diverted into other Channels, and loſt to the State of Maſſachuſetts.</p>
            <p>This Caſe alone (though there are other abſurd Caſes which might be ſtated) is ſufficient to ſhow the Neceſſity and Propriety of Congreſs being the ſole Legiſlators, in commercial Matters, for all and every of the States, and alſo to ſhow, that the commercial Laws and Regulations of all the States of the Union, ought to be the ſame
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:020600_0009_0FB05153B3AC8400"/>
throughout, for that otherwiſe it will always be in the Power of individual States to take Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of, and ſharp upon other States, as much as if they were diſunited States.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sharping</hi> being here mentioned, it may not be impertinent to touch upon a Practice had in ſome States, of decrying and depreciating, and refuſing to take the Paper Money of other States, in Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, unleſs a certain Diſcount is allowed by the Tenderer of ſuch Paper Money to the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deree or Perſon who is to receive the ſame. Of this Kind of Traffic there have lately been glaring Inſtances, in Regard to the Paper Money of the State of <hi>New-Jerſey,</hi> which the Dealers in New-York, and even New-Jerſey-Men themſelves, refuſed, and ſtill do refuſe, to take, except upon a Diſcount of at leaſt one Penny in every Shilling; and by artful Management, this Practice has been extended ſo as to introduce a Variety of Tricks and Frauds into different Dealings and Tranſactions. From ſuch Practice it muſt be obvious that art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Dealers have it in their Power to decry and depreciate the Paper Money of any State, and thereby to <hi>Sharp</hi> upon innocent and plain Perſons at every Turn, and on all Occaſions of their Dealing. One Way to prevent ſuch Practice for the future might be, for Congreſs, by an Act, to declare that all Paper Money, or Bills for Money on Credit, emitted by any individual State, in Time coming, ſhall be aided, countenanced, and ſupported by the Credit of the United States<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and where any individual State ſhall ultimately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:020600_0010_0FB05156D97FCD30"/>
deficient in Credit, or in the ſatisfying of Demands upon them, on Account of their Paper Money, that ſuch Deficiency ſhall ultimately be made a Charge againſt the United States, which they ſhall be anſwerable to pay, and the deficient State ſhall be bound to relieve and indemnify the United States, of and from all Deficiency, in the beſt and moſt expeditious Manner that ſuch defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient State can relieve and indemnify the United States.—Another Way to diſcourage, if not to prevent the abovementioned Practice, might be by an Act to be paſſed by Congreſs, making it a public Offence and Miſdemeanor, in and for any Perſon or Perſons to decry or depreciate, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Currency of the Paper Money of any individual State, or to take any Diſcount on any Paper Money of any individual State, and making it lawful for any Perſon or Perſons inhabiting in any of the United States, to ſummon the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender and Offenders in the Premiſes, to appear before any one or two or more Juſtices acting in the State where the Offender reſides; and upon Proof being made of the Offence, by the Oath of one or more credible Witneſſes, the Juſtice or Juſtices taking Cognizance of the Offence, to fine the Offender in any Sum not exceeding Twelve Pounds Currency, to be paid to the Perſon or Perſons complaining, beſides his or their reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Charges and Coſts in that Behalf ſuſtained. And upon the Offender neglecting or refuſing to pay ſuch Fine and Coſts, making it lawful for ſuch Juſtice and Juſtices to commit the Offender to the next Gaol, there to continue impriſoned till he pays the Fine and Coſts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:020600_0011_0FB051599807A838"/>So much concerning a Practice not provided againſt by the Articles of Confederation, may be deemed a Digreſſion; but now to return to the Obſervations on the penning of the American Articles.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. It appears to be ſtipulated, that in deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining Queſtions in the United States in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs aſſembled, each State ſhall have one Vote, (as in Article 5th) But this appears to be wrong; for that a State twice as large and twice as popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as another State, ought to have two Votes, when the leſſer State has only one Vote, and the leaſt or ſmalleſt State muſt certainly have one Vote; but the larger, more extenſive, more conſiderable, and more reſpectable States, ought to have more than one Vote, ought to have two, or three, or four, or more Votes, in Proportion to the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between a conſiderable or large State, and a ſmaller State. To maintain otherwiſe, is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard an equal and fair Repreſentation of the States by their Delegates in Congreſs aſſembled. But if more than one Vote is to be allowed to ſome States, ſtill it will not be neceſſary to cauſe thoſe States to ſend a Delegate for each Vote they may become intitled to; for that if they have but one Delegate attending in Congreſs, ſuch one Delegate may vote as many Times as his Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuents are intitled to vote on any Queſtion.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Where it is provided, that no Treaty of Commerce ſhall be made, whereby the legiſlative Power of the reſpective States ſhall be reſtrained from impoſing ſuch Impoſts and Duties on Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:020600_0012_0FB0515B20DBD1C8"/>
as their own People are ſubjected to, or from prohibiting the Exportation or Importation of any Species of Goods or Commodities whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever (as in Article 9th.) It appears to be moſt improperly expreſſed and penned; for that no Treaty of Commerce ought to be made, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to be made or entered into, by any Power, other than the Congreſs, and no individual State ought to poſſeſs a legiſlative Power of impoſing Duties on Foreigners, or of prohibiting the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation or Importation of any Goods or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, all which ought to be left to Congreſs, as poſſeſſing the ſovereign and united legiſlative Powers of all the individual States; and under this Head of Obſervations, what has been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned above, in the 3d Head of Obſervations, will forcibly apply.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. That the United States in Congreſs aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, ſhould be the laſt Reſort, on Appeal, in all Caſes (as in the ſaid Article 9th) appears to be right and proper; but then there is no Proviſion made for enforcing the Deciſions or Determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Congreſs, or for carrying them into Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution or Effect; and ſuch Proviſion may have been deſignedly omitted, by the Opinion of ſome Perſon or Perſons concerned in the penning of the Articles, who might conſider ſuch a Proviſion unneceſſary, becauſe it is a Principle or Rule in Law, that where a Juriſdiction is given to any Perſon, or a Body of Perſons, to determine Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Controverſy or Diſpute between Parties, it follows by Conſequence, that the Perſon, or
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:020600_0013_0FB0515DECB15C48"/>
Body of Perſons intitled to the Juriſdiction, muſt have an inherent Right to render their Juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion effectual, and to have their Deciſions and Determinations enforced and carried into due Execution, by all the Ways and Means in Law, uſual or practicable for enforcing the Deciſions and Determinations of any Juriſdiction whatever. But as this Principle, or Rule of Law, is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite, and not obvious to every Perſon, or any Perſons not learned in the Law, it would be better to have an expreſs Proviſion for enabling Congreſs to enforce their Deciſions, and carry them into Execution. For this Purpoſe a Law may be paſſed by Congreſs, enacting, that in all Caſes of Deciſions or Determinations made by Congreſs, upon Matters of Controverſy or Diſpute between one individual State and another State, or more individual States, the State or States refuſing or declining to obey and conform to ſuch Deciſions and Determinations, or to acquieſce therein, ſhall be deemed guilty of the higheſt Contempt againſt the ſovereign Authority of Congreſs, and making it lawful for Congreſs to puniſh any refractory State or States, by and with ſuch high Penalties, Fines, or Amerciaments, for their Contempt, as ſuch their Contempt may appear to Congreſs to deſerve: And alſo making it lawful to and for any Perſon or Perſons, to be appointed by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs for that Purpoſe, to attach any two or more of the moſt reputable and moſt reſponſible Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of and in ſuch refractory and diſobedient State or States, and the Perſons ſo attached to be
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020600_0014_0FB0515EDC71C0E8"/>
anſwerable for the Whole of the State or States they belong to, and liable to pay ſuch Fines, Penalties, and Amerciaments, as ſhall, by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, be impoſed on the delinquent State or States; but the Perſon and Perſons ſo anſwering and paying for the delinquent State or States, to be reimburſed and indemnified by the reſpective State or States, according to the Rules and Uſage of Law, in Caſes where a certain ſmall Number of Perſons in a State, County, Pariſh, or other Diſtrict <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               </gap> attached to anſwer for the Whole.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. Where it is declared, that the United States in Congreſs aſſembled, ſhall never engage in a War, &amp;c. unleſs nine States aſſent to the ſame (as in Part of the ſaid Article 9th). It appears wrong and abſurd; for it is plain, that the ſovereign, ſupreme, and abſolute Power was properly intended to be lodged, and ought to be lodged with Congreſs; and their Reſolves and Engagements, whether concerning a War, or any other public Matter, ought, in all Caſes, to go by a Majority of the Votes or Voices of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated Members, preſent and acting at the Time, and in no Reſolve or Engagement, ought the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of nine States to be conſidered as neceſſary or proper, but on the contrary unneceſſary and improper; becauſe, in many Caſes, and on ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Occaſions of Importance, it might happen, that Nine States, out of Thirteen, might not have their Delegates preſent in Congreſs, which might ſtop, impede, and even defeat, ſome very important Reſolve, however neceſſary it might
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:020600_0015_0FB0516059359530"/>
be for the public Good to have it paſſed inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>Here it may appear pertinent to mention one other Defect of the Articles of Union, which is, that Congreſs, in any Part of the Articles, is not veſted with any Power or Controul over any of its own Members, and it has been ſaid, that any Member, on the Principle of Law, that <hi>Inter Pares nulla Poteſtas,</hi> may leave Congreſs, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he pleaſes, without Leave from Congreſs, or the State he repreſents; and that there has been an Inſtance, of a late Queſtion before Congreſs, being loſt by the wilful Abſence of a Member. If it has been ſo, it muſt be conſidered an egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Defect in the Articles of Union, for it is believed, that this has been the firſt Inſtance in the World, of a ſovereign and ſupreme Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, conferred on a Body of Men, and at the ſame Time leaving them without any Power or Authority over their own individual Members. In various Juriſdictions, in different Countries, it has frequently happened, that individual Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, have been attached, fined, and even im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned for Abſence, Neglect, and Contempt of Duty; and ſo it ought to be in Congreſs, and ſuch Power ought to be aſſumed by Congreſs, as a Matter of Courſe, incident to, and inherent in their Juriſdiction; but if it is weakly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that Congreſs cannot exerciſe any Power or Authority over their own Members, without an expreſs Law for that purpoſe; ſuch Law may eaſily be paſſed by Congreſs, making it a high
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:020600_0016_0FB051625D4E51C0"/>
Miſdemeanor, in and for any Member to depart, or abſent himſelf from his duty in Congreſs, without the Leave of Congreſs, firſt had and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and to make thoſe Members of Congreſs who counteract ſuch Law, liable and ſubject to ſuch Fines and Cenſures as to Congreſs, by the Majority of Votes, ſhall, in their Diſcretion, ſeem meet; and to ſuch Law, no Concurrence of any individual State or States, can, in the Nature of the Thing, be at all neceſſary or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
