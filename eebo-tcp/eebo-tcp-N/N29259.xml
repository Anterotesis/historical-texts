            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following work is written with a deſire of placing, in a <hi>practical</hi> light, ſome of the prominent abſurdities of many ſelf-important reformers of mankind, who, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heated their imaginations, ſit down to write <hi>political romances,</hi> which never were, and never will be practical; but which, coming into the hands of perſons as little acquainted with human nature, the hiſtory of mankind, and the proofs of religious au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticity, as themſelves, hurry away the mind from common life into dreams of i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deal felicity; or, by breaking every moral tie (while they declaim about morals) turn looſe their diſciples upon the world, to root up and overthrow every thing which has received the ſanction of ages, and been held ſacred by men of real genius and erudition.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more eaſy, if we leave human nature and <hi>common-place</hi> reaſon out of the queſtion, than to write a ſyſtem of juriſpru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, a perfect republic, a body of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical juſtice, or a catalogue of rights: but a cloſe attention to any of theſe works will readily bring forward glaring and palpable
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:038973_0005_1012824D789F4CE0"/>
contradictions. What are the various claſſes of mankind to think, when theſe men not only <hi>contradict themſelves,</hi> but every one has a ſyſtem widely oppoſite to the other, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only that every regular order and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, religious, moral, and political, is worn out in this age of reaſon, and muſt be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>It may be right to appriſe the reader, that the words <hi>political juſtice,</hi> are ſcarce ever introduced, except when the ſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iment is taken from Mr. Godwin's Polit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical Juſtice, 4to. edition.</p>
            <p>No doubt thoſe who feel themſelves <hi>ſore,</hi> will endeavour to caſt upon the work the charge of exaggeration; but, on this ſubject it is <hi>impoſſible</hi> to exaggerate; ſo inimical are the doctrines of Godwin, Hume, Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau, &amp;c. to all civil ſociety, that, when the reader candidly reflects, he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the inferences I have drawn from <hi>their</hi> texts naturally reſult.</p>
            <p>Can we wonder at the prevalence of adultery, when doctrines ſuch as theſe men hold out in <hi>faſcinating language,</hi> are toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated? Can we wonder at the vices and crimes of a neighbouring people? Or, can we wonder, that the generality of <hi>ſhallow</hi>-thinking men embrace and ſupport them with ardour?</p>
            <p>Many of the modern reformiſts, amongſt

the moſt forward, Mr. Paine, aſſerts, that there is no ſuch exiſtence as a Britiſh Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Let thoſe men, and their adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, peruſe De Lolme on that ſubject; let all who are repining at their lot read that excellent work, and they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſingular bleſſings they enjoy, which, becauſe they are familiar, are deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed; and let us not act like men in health, who undermine their conſtitution by exceſs, till ſickneſs teaches them the ineſtimable value of what they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkingly and irreparably deſtroyed.</p>

            <head>PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.</head>
            <p>IT has been ſuggeſted to me to print a <hi>cheap</hi> edition, which might be within the purchaſe of <hi>all ranks,</hi> and tend to open the eyes of many deluded followers of the <hi>new</hi> Philoſophers. But though this work was written from the moſt ardent deſire of warning the world of the intentions and tendency of jacobinical principles, there are <hi>two</hi> reaſons for my objecting to this advice:—Firſt, as Mr. P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ayfair ſays, in his excellent Hiſtory of Jacobiniſm, "He who <hi>pleaded</hi> the cauſe of murder and plunder, <hi>ſaw his</hi> work diſtributed by thouſands and hundreds of thouſands, and himſelf en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched; while he, who endeavoured to ſupport the cauſe of law, of order, and of the proprietor, had his bookſeller to pay, and ſaw his labours converted into waſte paper. It is true he had the conſolation of his own mind, and the eſteem of the few to whom his intentions were known; but with regard to effect upon the public mind, it produced none: his main object was therefore unattained, and the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:038973_0008_10128253CACEFBA8"/>
argument remained triumphant. With energy, ſome money, and a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to make uſe of it on one ſide; and on the other, indolence, with pecuniary means in abundance, but not the <hi>will</hi> to employ one ſhilling of it; can we be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed that things went in favour of thoſe who had the energy and the will? It would have been ſurpriſing if it had not; and accordingly we have ſeen the ſhirtleſs, ſhoeleſs <hi>Vagabond,</hi> burning the caſtles and title-deeds of the proprietor, and with an high hand put themſelves in the place. Let the rich aſk, Which ſide will have moſt writers, thoſe who pay, or thoſe who do not?" Secondly, through the medium of circulating Libraries, any man may read the work for muchleſs, than though it were printed on paper like the Rights of Man.</p>
            <p>In the preſent inſtance, however, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpeak from what I have experienced, and it gives me conſiderable hopes that the deſtructive torpor of the rich is evap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orating, and that they begin to take an active intereſt in the preſent criſis: I have only to obſerve, that Two Editions have been ſold in leſs than ſix months.</p>
            <p>Mr. Playfair, when he is ſpeaking of the diffidence, and diſtruſt, and jealouſy, and indifference of the different nations, ſays: "But if they will not prepare ſeriouſly to
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:038973_0009_1012825C074144F0"/>
reſiſt, they muſt prepare to ſuffer; for France will give law to Europe if ſhe once gets the better, and then adieu to thoſe Principalities and Powers who have quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled about uſeleſs etiquette, when they ſhould have rivalled each other in MANLY COURAGE; and who will continue in all likelihood to diſpute about their rights and privileges, till there remain none for them to diſpute about."</p>
            <p>It is here that the conduct and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Great-Britain <hi>deſerves well</hi> of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. But for the energy of this nation, Europe would, ere this, have been ſqueez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pieces with the <hi>Gallic hug</hi>: and this country would have ſwelled its bloated pride. But the VOLUNTEERS have ſaved the nation. They have told France, that before ſhe can <hi>plunder and burn London, that ſelfiſh and ſhopkeeping city,</hi> according to the threat of Barrere, ſhe muſt float in the air, and march through a foreſt of pikes and bayonets. They have told the French Propagande that we are not to be cajoled with flatteries and lies to believe a people, who conquer more by theſe means than by the ſword; and they have told the idle and rebellious, that they cannot hope for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. While we remain firm to ourſelves, we may ſuffer much, but cannot be brought under the yoke of France.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER I. The Meeting of two Republican Philoſophers.</head>
               <p>ONE fine ſummer evening, Doctor Alogos walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to the banks of Wynander Meer, to enjoy the beautiful ſcenery ſurrounding, and reflected in the mirror of the cryſtal lake.</p>
               <p>'This is charming,' ſaid he to himſelf, as he walked onward; 'the harmony of nature is viſible in every object round me; the clouds form a majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic and ever-varying canopy; man alone deviates from that pure ſtate of exiſtence he knew in the golden age; man alone is unhappy; his paſſions and his appetites in ſociety know no bounds ſhort of attainment; and why? becauſe he will not copy the example of unerring nature in her conduct of animals. Theſe never deviate into rapine and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage —they live free, and are happy.'</p>
               <p>At that moment he heard a noiſe in the air, and looking round, diſtinguiſhed a hawk in full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit after a lapwing. The harmleſs creature flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and appeared nearly exhauſted, while the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:038973_0013_1012826A750D0248"/>
bird of prey redoubled his exertions—Doctor Alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos, who uſually walked with a fowling-piece for his amuſement, brought the hawk down at a ſhot; and the lapwing, as if to thank him, ſettled near upon the ground. In a little time it recovered from its fright, and a fine worm creeping before it fell a prey to <hi>inſtinct.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Doctor muſed on this ſubject as he contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued his walk.—'At worſt,' ſaid he, 'this is only a partial evil, and does not interrupt the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the univerſe; it is only matter changing form, and making room in the great field of nature for new exiſtences; if we had no hawks, in twenty years the whole ſurface of the earth would be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with lapwings; and if we had no lapwings, the whole globe would be ſo over-run with worms, that, like a Cheſhire cheeſe filled with mites, the cruſting would crumble away. It is neceſſary that the ſtronger animals ſhould prey upon the weaker, and quite in the order of things: but for men to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der each other, is very different, and ariſes from an unjuſt accumulation of property. Oh happy times when <hi>property</hi> was unregarded, when no tyrant could plant his foot upo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As the Doctor ſtamped his foot on the ground in the attitude of an orator, heated with the idea of revolution and equality, a young man in a very rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged dreſs leaped from a thicket of hazels, and holding a piſtol to the Doctor's breaſt, demanded his money.</p>
               <p>The Doctor's piece was unloaded, or his benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence for the human ſpecies might have been loſt in the agitation of ſurpriſe; but making a full p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

he, 'is not right in the nature of things; force tells me that your argument is wrong; you ſhould have firſt convinced me of your wants, and then my purſe would have been your juſt property.'</p>
               <p>'All property is a monopoly,' cried the young metaphyſician, 'and the moſt laconic arguments are beſt: theſe rags which I wear are ſufficient vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for my wants; and unleſs you can prove that ſome other has a greater claim to your property, I muſt have the contents of your pocket.'</p>
               <p>'You are a philoſopher,' ſaid the Doctor.</p>
               <p>'Yes,' replied the youth; 'my dear Stupeo uſed to tell me ſo; but philoſophy is not rewarded in the preſent deteſtable ſyſtem of things; virtue is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culed, and vice rides in gilded coaches.'</p>
               <p>'How much do you need?' ſaid the Doctor, in tranſport. 'You are a pupil of the <hi>new ſchool;</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>

               <p>'Stupeo was perfectly right,' ſaid the youth, 'he told me that all men are equal: I will go with you.'</p>
               <p>'Who is this Stupeo?' inquired the Doctor, while the young man walked by his ſide. 'He was a very great philoſopher, a mythologiſt, a met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphyſician, and a ſcholar: he was my tutor at college.'</p>
               <p>'You a collegian!' cried the Doctor, in ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe: 'how came you in this miſerable condition, and how could you commit ſuch an act of danger<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ous outrage?' 'From the moſt natural reaſon in the world: all crime, my dear ſir, ariſes from ſome poſſeſſing what others want; but in fact, there is no ſuch thing as crime; it is a mere chimera, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting only in the law, like John Doe and Richard Roe.'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:038973_0015_10128270D863BA88"/>'There ſurely are crimes,' interrupted the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, 'crimes againſt political juſtice, and the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the individual: as for inſtance, I have, as a willing animal, a right or power to take a walk; but if I am to be aſſaſſinated every time I go out, my liberty is reſtrained, my houſe becomes a priſon, and I might as well be in a dungeon. I think crimes of this nature ought to be puniſhed.'</p>
               <p>'How? By coercion or reſtraint?—My dear Stupeo uſed to ſay that puniſhment is a ſpecious name, but is in reality nothing more than force, put upon one being by another who happens to be ſtronger. How can truth be promoted by this? If I am hanged for what is called a robbery, how am I convinced of my error? And it is the reform of the individual you ſhould ſeek, and not the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment of an action partial in its nature.'</p>
               <p>'You are wrong,' ſaid the Doctor; the offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ought to be reſtrained as long as the ſafety of the community preſcribes it, for this is juſt: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain him not an inſtant from a ſimple view to his own improvement, for this is contrary to reaſon and morality<note n="*" place="bottom">See page 132 and 161 of Political Juſtice, where the two laſt contradictory abſurdities will be found verbatim.</note>.'</p>
               <p>'But my dear ſir,' cried the youth, warmly, 'Stupeo, who was a philoſopher and a metaphyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, ſays—'</p>
               <p>'Says a fiddleſtick,' retorted the Doctor, 'it is the good of the whole we are to ſeek; what ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies individuals? they are as mites in the univerſe. Truth, truth muſt be propagated, and I glory to ſee we are making ſuch rapid progreſs.'</p>
               <p>They were by this time arrived at the gate of a neat-looking manſion, with high chimnies, and heavy cornices, which declared it to have been erected in the time of William the Third, a flower
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:038973_0016_1012827276EB76A8"/>
garden ſpread before it, in which a beautiful young woman was gathering flowers. She appeared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout eighteen, with all the innocence of that period, and the beauty attending upon health and good nature.</p>
               <p>'Your daughter, I ſuppoſe?' ſaid the ſtranger.</p>
               <p>'No,' replied the Doctor; 'do you think I would belie my principles by uniting myſelf for life to any object, when the human mind is of ſo changeable a nature? She is my neice; her parents, who were very poor, and very ignorant, are dead. I attempted to educate her on my plan; but ſhe is of a perverſe diſpoſition, ſhe will not exert the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine privilege of reſiſtance, and throw off the ſhackles of domination: ſhe perſiſts that the very difference of ſexes ſhould teach us that they are deſigned for different purſuits.'</p>
               <p>'Laura,' cried the Doctor, 'have you ſet my room in order? I have brought home a ſtranger.'</p>
               <p>'No,' replied Laura, bluſhing; 'I was obliged to viſit a poor old woman in the village; and I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, as ſoon as I had gathered ſome flowers, to arrange your apartment.'</p>
               <p>'The d—l take all the old women in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe,' cried the Doctor, in a paſſion, 'with their diſeaſes and their wants! What had you to do, you idle ſlut, with gathering flowers, when all my room is covered with litter? What a wretched ſtate is ſociety! every thing thwarting the temper, and ſpoiling our reflections.'</p>
               <p>'In a ſtate of nature,' ſaid the young ſtranger, 'we ſhould certainly have fewer wants. The pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant ſpring would ſupply us with drink, and the maſt of the foreſt with food. How happy would it be if all mankind, by univerſal conſent, would deſtroy every veſtige of ſociety, and return to ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple nature!'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:038973_0017_1012827A595978B0"/>'Nothing is more true,' cried Doctor Alogos, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hand and leading him towards the houſe; 'you ſeem a youth of profound intelligence, and I glory in having diſcovered ſuch a gem. All the children of men are dear to my heart; and my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation boils when I hear that our brethren of Africa are urged to labour with a laſh—torn from ſupreme felicity—carried from the yellow ſands of Guinea to the burning furnace of the Weſt-Indies, and all for what? to ſupply us with ſpices and ſweet-meats. I could hug a Tartar to my breaſt, and divide my little property with a Greenlander.'</p>
               <p>A wounded ſoldier at that moment accoſted them from the gate, entreating a morſel of bread, or a farthing to buy it with.</p>
               <p>The Doctor's countenance reddened, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round—'Go,' cried he, 'to your pariſh; for what do I pay ſo many poor's rates, if my purſe is to be always open to ſuch vagrants? In a ſtate of nature there is no neceſſity for ſoldiers; and I am determined I will not ſupport the preſent infamous ſyſtem.' So ſaying, he ſlapped the door in the ſoldier's face; and leading his new friend up ſtairs, they entered an elegant apartment, the furniture of which was in a ſtyle of the greateſt luxury.</p>
               <p>'Is ſupper ready?' inquired the Doctor of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant girl, who entered the room to place his chair, —'It won't be ready this half hour,' replied ſhe, pertly: 'if you want it ſooner, you muſt come and help to get it yourſelf.'</p>
               <p>'Go along, you baggage,' ſaid the Doctor, laughing. Then turning to his gueſt, 'This,' ſaid he, 'is a girl of independent ſpirit, the genuine equality for which I admire her. If my niece were a little more of her diſpoſition, I ſhould be extremely fond of her—not for herſelf, becauſe I am above
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038973_0018_1012827BF0B46628"/>
all thoſe falſe notions of relative connexion, but for her virtues.'</p>
               <p>Supper was ſoon after ſerved in a ſtyle that would have gratified an epicure. The Doctor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, between every bite, on the virtues of temperance, and the beauties of nature.—The young man ate little, being engaged with the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Laura: and the latter was much abaſhed by the company of a ſtranger, who, though in a garb that declared preſent poverty, had yet a nobleneſs of phyſiognomy, which ſhone forth beneath the cloud that enſhrouded him.</p>
               <p>Having ſufficiently ſatisfied the demands of nature and appetite, the Doctor ordered his niece to retire; and having repleniſhed the table with wine, which he obſerved was taxed in an infamous manner, he requeſted the ſtranger to relate the outlines of his hiſtory.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER II. The progreſs of Truth and Philoſophy in an ignorant mind.</head>
               <p>MY name is Frederic Fenton. I might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be aſhamed to mention my family, when you ſee me in theſe miſerable garments; but truth muſt be ſpoken without regard to thoſe falſe prejudices, which call folly by the name of honor.</p>
               <p>My parents have great landed poſſeſſions, that is, are great tyrants, in the county of Kent. They educated me in all the ſuperſtitions of the Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038973_0019_1012827F2A92FCA0"/>
church, and my whole ſtudy was to conform to their deſires, and reſtrain my wiſhes to the line of what they called rectitude and religion.</p>
               <p>I was ſo groſsly ignorant, as to believe that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obeying them was diſpleaſing to the Almighty; and I conſidered religion as a ſure means of leading me to a better world, and making me hereafter hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: but theſe were the dreams of unenlightened im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination, impreſſed upon me by education.</p>
               <p>Learning appeared in my eyes the greateſt object of human attainment; and my parents delighting in my progreſs, my whole powers were bent to the acquirement of what they called valuable know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p>I did not then know that profound ignorance is the real and only ſtate in which men can enjoy fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity; and that every advance from this is ſo far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verging from the intention of nature.</p>
               <p>I was never eaſy under the neglect of a duty, becauſe I either feared the cenſure of my parents, or the vengeance of an offended deity: and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frained for theſe reaſons from committing any of thoſe actions, falſe morality particularly conſiders atrocious. So eager was my application to ſtudy, and ſo tenacious my memory, that at fifteen I was judged capable of commencing ſtudent in form.</p>
               <p>I took leave of my parents with tears; and my boſom ſeemed to loſe its tranquility at parting with a youth nearly my own age, and who had been my friend and companion from infancy. Vernon was not leſs affected; and we vowed eternal amity at our ſeparation.</p>
               <p>At the recommendation of a nobleman, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Stupeo became my preceptor. He was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of mean birth; but that diſtinction I deſpiſed, ſeeing in him only a man of talents.</p>
               <p>He began his plan of education, with ſtarting
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038973_0020_101282820BF1B958"/>
bold truths, which ſhocked and dazzled me with their luſtre, without confounding my perceptions. 'I will not,' ſaid he, 'overwhelm you at once with the whole blaze of knowledge, though I would as little wiſh to lead you ſtep by ſtep, as though I would ſurpriſe you to an acquieſcence with truth: immortal truth can never loſe by being ſeen; it bears down every barrier; it is a mighty torrent; it may be ſtayed for a while, but the acceleration of its rapidity will increaſe in equal ratio.'</p>
               <p>At firſt I ventured to obſerve, that the human mind is too often led into error by a deception of the ſenſes, which are ever ready to adopt any new object, however abſurd. His eloquence, which was like the torrent he deſcribed, ſoon overcame my weak objections, and the firſt gleam of truth and philoſophy dawned upon my ſoul.</p>
               <p>He lamented the profound obedience I paid to my parents. 'My dear pupil,' ſaid he, 'what is this bondage you call duty? And what right have thoſe beings you call father and mother to direct your actions, and controul the inborn vigour of your ſoul?'</p>
               <p>'By the claim of nature; by the trouble they have taken for my preſervation; and by the love they bear me in particular,' ſaid I.</p>
               <p>'Unjuſt in extreme!' cried he. 'Do your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents love you for your real value?—No! it is ariſtocracy, ſelf-love, and family pride, that teach them to ſet a value on you. No human being ought to be preferred becauſe that being is my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, my wife, or my ſon<note n="*" place="bottom">Political Juſtice.</note>; it is the good of the whole we ſhould endeavour to promote. And what is your claim of nature? Are not all men born free? Children can be no longer connected with their father, than while they ſtand in wood of his
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038973_0021_10128288F8A7CCA8"/>
aſſiſtance. When this becomes needleſs, the natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al tie is of courſe diſſolved, the children are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the obedience they owe their father, and the father is equally ſo from the ſolicitude due from him to his children; both aſſume a ſtate of independence reſpecting each other<note n="*" place="bottom">Rouſſeau.</note>.'</p>
               <p>'But gratitude,' replied I, 'would ſeem to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire reverence and eſteem.'</p>
               <p>'Gratitude!—Nonſenſe,' anſwered he, 'I ought to eſteem a benefactor, not becauſe he has done a kindneſs to me, but becauſe he has done it to a human being<note n="†" place="bottom">Godwin.</note>.'</p>
               <p>'But if what my parents requeſt is for my own advantage, ſurely there can be no crime in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?'</p>
               <p>'Of that you are the beſt judge: if the action be good, it ſhould be done becauſe it is ſo, and not becauſe certain perſons have requeſted or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded you to do it.

               <p>'I am convinced,' ſaid I. 'I doubt whether I ever had a father, or ever was born: I will no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er be held in the leading-ſtrings of obedience.'</p>

which my dear Stupeo taught me would never return. 'How few are our years, and of thoſe years, how few are allowed to pleaſure!' would he ſay. 'Graſp then, my pupil, the moments as they fly, for all beyond this life is annihilation and non-entity: dry and barren ſtudy is well enough for muddy ſouls, but not for thoſe who know how to live.'</p>
               <p>It is ſurpriſing with what conviction truth flaſhes upon the mind:—Stupeo's axioms were unrefuta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ble, and I found the ſuperiority of pleaſure over all the laborious and muſty reſearches of learning, which never ſatisfy a doubting philoſophic mind.</p>
               <p>I confeſs I ran into a few eccentricities, ſuch as breaking the leg of a waiter in a drunken frolic— getting a fever by a ſurfeit—and ſpending my ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary before it became due; but theſe are the nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary attendants on this miſerable ſyſtem of things. We are ſo enervated, with <hi>drinking tea,</hi> that we cannot withſtand the power of fixed air in fluids: and the monopoly of property prevents our ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more than we can acquire.</p>
               <p>Theſe reflections naturally led me to abhor ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of every kind. It is ſingular how we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe great truths, when once the mind doubts of every thing. The genius of liberty ſhone reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in mine eyes, and I groaned at the ſufferings of my fellow men. I ſaw that no poſſible right could bind any man in ſlavery. What power had any generation of men to fell their poſterity (no matter who bought them)? When had I <hi>given my conſent</hi> to the government I lived under? Never; and therefore to me it was as <hi>abſolute</hi> a deſpotiſm as any under the ſun<note n="*" place="bottom">Paine.</note>. It was no conſequence to me that it might be juſt and well adminiſtered; to me it was a tyranny. I confeſs there ſeemed a trifling argument againſt this <hi>new truth;</hi> for it

ſeemed a matter of difficulty, that the government ſhould be ſending to every individual, as he attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed certain years, to know if he approved their eſtabliſhment. But in the beſt of ſyſtems there is always ſome little defect; and ſurely Voltaire, Rouſſeau, Tom Paine, and the metaphyſician Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peo, knew which was for the beſt. 'I even doubt,' ſaid the latter, 'whether the very article of our birth be not a great breach of political juſtice, ſince our conſent was not required.'</p>
               <p>He was a moſt exquiſite reaſoner; I remember him expatiating one day on the happineſs of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral liberty: he kindled into enthuſiaſm on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. 'War,' cried he, 'that deſtroys our vitals, and in one moment ſilences eloquence, genius, and every virtue, with the howlings of miſery, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and deſpair, would never exiſt but for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations of monarchs.

               <p>'Did the Tyrians, the Grecians, the Romans, the Carthaginians never go to war?' ſaid I. But Stupeo knew his ground too well to be ſtopped by ſo <hi>trifling</hi> a queſtion: he continued—'The recip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocal relations of mankind, while living together in their primitive independence, were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently durable to conſtitute a ſtate, either of peace or war, ſo that <hi>men</hi> cannot be naturally enemies. It is the relation ſubſiſting <hi>between things,</hi> and <hi>not between men,</hi> that gives riſe to war; which ariſing not from <hi>perſonal</hi> but <hi>real</hi> relations, cannot ſubſiſt between man and man, either in a ſtate of nature or in a ſtate of ſociety, in which every thing is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured

Thus it being evident, that as men never can be at variance with men, for as much as no ſavages in a ſtate of nature ever fight; it follows, that war never could happen, but for the quarrels of a ſet of tyrants, who lead men into the field of battle to butcher each other with their eyes ſhut.'</p>
               <p>'Then man becomes a mere machine?' ſaid I.</p>
               <p>'Man a machine!' ſaid he, with ardour: 'man is a ſublime animal; the great lord of creation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is true his ſoul is nothing but an heap or collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of different perceptions, or objects, united together by <hi>certain relations,</hi> and ſuppoſed, though falſely, to be endowed with perfect ſimplicity and identity.

But ſetting aſide ſome metaphyſicians of this kind (who believe they have a ſoul), I may venture to affirm, of the reſt of mankind, that they are <hi>nothing</hi> but a bundle or collection of different perceptions, which ſucceed each other with inconceivable rapidity, and are in a perpetual flux and movement<note n="†" place="bottom">Hume on Human Nature, vol. i. page 361 and 438.</note>.</p>
               <p>'But,' ſaid I, 'you tell me you are <hi>certain</hi> you have no ſoul, and yet you lay it down as a maxim, that we are not to be certain of any thing. This is ſure a contradiction. Beſide, if this bundle of ideas is always changing, and never the ſame, what is memory? How am I conſcious that I ate my breakfaſt this morning, and got drunk laſt night?'</p>

               <p>'Then,' ſaid I, 'the idea of an inch muſt be an inch long, and of a mile a mile long. If I have an idea of a roaring lion, or a thunder ſtorm, I ſhall hear the ſounds, only in a ſmaller degree.

               <p>In this new path of philoſophy, I made ſo much progreſs, that I ſoon ceaſed to trouble myſelf with the jargon of the ſchools: Ariſtotle, Grotius, and Puffendorf, appeared as ſo many children, and even the great Locke, but an infant in ſcience. Latin and Greek became the moſt inſipid of ſtudies; and in fact, my moments were too precious to be waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on ſuch trifles.</p>
               <p>My father wrote me ſeveral letters, expreſſive of his grief at my change of principles, and hinting, that he would diſcharge Stupeo, if I attended to his infernal doctrines.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:038973_0026_1012829783C79720"/>'And ſo,' cried the great logical metaphyſician, 'you will ſtoop to the domination of this man, who wiſhes to cramp the divine impulſes of your ſoul, to torpedo your faculties!

               <p>What reaſoning could be more juſt, or delivered in more eloquent terms? I wrote in reply that my mind was free, that I deteſted controul, and would not ſubmit to the directions of any tyrant, however diſtinguiſhed by name.</p>
               <p>My father returned me an anſwer in the mildeſt terms: he requeſted me to conſider how much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention he had beſtowed upon me in my early years. He aſked how I ſhould think of the man, who ſhould return any favour I did him, with equal neglect and contempt. He entreated me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider if any of his former advice had been in any ways detrimental to my own welfare; and to reflect, that no poſſible advantage could ariſe to him from my proceeding in a virtuous life, except that of beholding one, whom he had been a mean of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the world, an honour to his country, to human nature, and to himſelf. He concluded with entreating me to meet him at a certain houſe upon the road, where he would communicate to me mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of great importance; and ſhould ſet out from home (though very unwell) the moment he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my promiſe to meet him.</p>
               <p>Stupeo was on a party of pleaſure when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this letter. I am almoſt aſhamed to own the impreſſion it made upon me, though it is all in the old-faſhioned ſtyle; but we cannot at

once wholly overcome every prejudice of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>I wrote immediately, that I would attend at the place appointed. I delayed till Stupeo arrived. He was ſurpriſed to find me ready for a journey, and more ſo when I informed him of the particulars.</p>
               <p>'Weak, puerile, and inconſtant man,' cried he, 'you reſolve in one hour what you undo the next. It was either fitting that you ſhould yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day have bowed to the commands of your father, or it is not fitting to-day: time cannot change a moral action.

               <p>SOME days after, I received a letter from my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, informing me, that the diſappointment he had received, with the fatigue of the journey, in his weak ſtate of health, had ſo much raiſed his fever, that he had little hopes of recovering his health; and that if I yet retained the ſmalleſt ſpark of filial piety, I would inſtantly haſten to him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:038973_0029_101282A1DF6D6518"/>I was at firſt ſhocked with the event, but it was evidently not owing to me, but the improper jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney he had taken; for to ſay the diſappointment could have ſuch an effect, was talking like a nerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous old woman. I was eaſily convinced by Stupeo that it was all a trick: and indeed I was in no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to undertake a journey into Kent; the charming girl who had not been a month introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, having given me ſufficient reaſon to remember her innocence.</p>
               <p>'What a ſhocking effect!' ſaid Stupeo; 'but you ought to doubt its reality.'</p>
               <p>'To doubt it?' cried I: 'No, no, I have no reaſon to doubt.'</p>
               <p>'But it may only exiſt in your idea, and that idea affects you.'</p>
               <p>'Affects me! How,' ſaid I. 'What, if I have an idea that my throat is cut, ſhall I find the blood ſtreaming about me?'</p>
               <p>'It all ariſes from the preſent miſerable ſyſtem of things, ſaid Stupeo; 'a deſpotiſm is the very worſt of governments.'</p>
               <p>'But what has deſpotiſm to do with it?' cried I peeviſhly; 'am not I burning with all the flames of a volcano? and ſhould I not have been well at this moment if I had attended my father? Pray how does this riſe from the government?'</p>
               <p>'I will maintain,' ſaid Stupeo, with metaphyſical coolneſs, 'this, and every thing elſe that is bad, ariſes from it. If genuine liberty were eſtabliſhed, all the female ſex would be within our choice; we ſhould not have to venture—What buſineſs has one man to monopolize a woman to himſelf?

               <p>'That muſt be a very admirable ſtate of things,' I replied; 'but at preſent, what are we to do, when our philanthropy muſt be practiſed in private? for it is a very dear article at Weſtminſter-Hall. I am almoſt tempted to think it is a judgment of Providence upon illicit connexion.</p>

In the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century to talk of Providence, is a mark of the profoundeſt ignorance. Do you think then that there is a great and omnipotent Being, who cares for ſuch a bundle of atoms as you are? All prieſt-craft and lies. Does any thing tell you that you ſhall live hereafter?'</p>
               <p>'I have an idea that I ſhall; and all ideas muſt be realities, only in a ſlighter degree, if the doctrine of the <hi>faſhionable</hi> Hume be true.'</p>
               <p>'Not in this caſe. Your exiſtence will terminate when the lobes of the lungs are no longer inflated, and the blood ceaſes to beat in the arteries.

'All this,' ſaid he, 'proceeds from phyſical <hi>neceſſity,</hi> and the nature of things; you impel a ball along a ſmooth ſurface, and it muſt proceed in a fixed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; ſo nature has given to all things an impulſe, which never ceaſes to act.

               <p>I endeavoured in vain to open the eyes of this bigoted youth, who was nearly my own age. I put into his hands books of religious controverſy, in hopes of catching his mind by ſome inſoluble queſtion. I demanded of him frequently an expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:038973_0034_101282B11736E6D0"/>
of all the articles of religious belief. I read to him the admirable writings of Voltaire and Hume: but he had the impudence to ſay, they contradicted each other; that Voltaire frequently aſſerted falſehoods as certainties, which three fourths of his readers had not means to detect; and that Hume was ſo contradictory and unintelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, that the reader was loſt in a jargon of words.</p>
               <p>He had taken a ſtrong fancy to a very elegant girl, the daughter of a farmer in our neighbourhood, and was never happy but when writing verſes in her praiſe, or teaching her what he called, the Chriſtian virtues. He was ſo jealous of this fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied property, that he was for excluding all others from their natural right. Had I attended to the old-faſhioned doctrine of <hi>honour,</hi> I might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frained from deſiring the girl myſelf; but our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments are very tranſient in this world, and none but fools will think of the next.</p>
               <p>Your church people, who believe that they have ſouls, might indeed be deterred from violating innocence, and plundering the weak: but I rejoice to think theſe notions are growing obſolete; and not being troubled with ſuch qualms myſelf, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to gratify the pure and natural deſire I had, at leaſt to divide with Vernon the affections of Amelia.</p>
               <p>The girl herſelf ſoon perceived the difference; for, having a quick underſtanding, ſhe became en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured of the new doctrines I daily diſcourſed upon, for they carried ſelf-evident proofs in the latitude they allowed for the paſſions and weakneſs of human nature.</p>
               <p>Vernon was of too jealous a diſpoſition not to perceive her growing coolneſs towards himſelf, and that all his ſanctified religious notions were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attended to. His vigilance was rouſed, and he ſoon
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:038973_0035_101282B2B3F22820"/>
diſcovered that I had not only ſupplanted him, but even gained thoſe favours he durſt not in idea think of: a glorious proof of the ſuperiority of truth, and the new morality.</p>
               <p>In the narrow ſpirit of ſelf-love, and the old times of chivalry, he ſent me a challenge with all the fire of a madman, and all the reproaches he could have uttered had I injured him in the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous manner.</p>
               <p>Determined to preſerve the dignity of conſcious innocence, I replied to him in a letter, 'That it was the offspring of deſpotiſm, to bring any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſword!—that his appeal to force was palpably wrong, as he ſhould have convinced me, by rational tenets, that I was not right. I alſo begged him to reflect, that my mind, being infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more illumined, and more liberal than his, I was ſo much more valuable in the ſcale of moral virtue. That his death would, in the eye of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical juſtice, be a matter of inſignificance, but that mine would be a great detriment to ſociety in general, for whoſe benefit I even durſt not uſe the ſelf-command of my perſon, by riſking it againſt his.<note n="*" place="bottom">The modern doctrine of Godwin and Co.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I happened to meet him the ſame evening, on my way to Amelia. His eye kindled the moment he ſaw me; and ſtanding firmly in my way, he waited my arrival.</p>
               <p>'Execrable coward<note n="†" place="bottom">I have been accuſed of pleading for duelling. Let any man, who calls himſelf a gentleman judge.</note>!' cried he, 'monſter of human depravity! you have forever ruined the tranquillity of my exiſtence, and you deny me the <hi>honourable</hi> ſatisfaction of a gentleman. Were there not others leſs worthy than Amelia, whom you might have contaminated with your deteſtable

               <p>'<hi>Friendſhip!</hi>' ſaid I, when his paſſion allowed him to pauſe; 'we ought never to form <hi>particular</hi> friendſhips with any one, to the excluſion of the whole ſpecies: every man ought to be our friend; but before we enter into confidence, we ought to inquire carefully into the worth of our object, that we may not beſtow upon him a regard which his abilities do not deſerve, or we ſhall act unjuſtly. We ought to be ſure, after a certain allowance for the fallibility of the human judgment<note n="*" place="bottom">Political Juſtice, page 86.</note>.'</p>
               <p>'Periſh ſuch infernal doctrines!' cried he, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting me: 'ſuch cold-hearted and diabolical ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems would unhinge all ſociety in the univerſe!'</p>
               <p>'True,' cried I, 'true, moſt true,' raiſing my voice, determined to be heard in the cauſe of truth. 'It were well for mankind, if ſociety were this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aboliſhed: we ſhould then be free from its vices; virtue would ſpread her celeſtial banner over the children of men; ſcience would dart the rays of its fecundating beams to the boſoms of all men; and liberty would ſpread her reign from zone to zone, and from one pole to the other.'</p>
               <p>'What is this jargon!' ſaid he, with a look of calm contempt: 'Is the liberty you wiſh, the right of raviſhing your friend's miſtreſs? Is this virtue you blaze forth—the committal of outrage, and ſlinking from the puniſhment? And what is your ſtate of nature, but a ſtate of anarchy and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed?'</p>
               <p>'You miſname every thing,' ſaid I. 'If the great metaphyſician Stupeo were here, he would ſoon convince you. As it is, I would aſk how I

have injured you? Is Amelia any way injured but in your romantic fancy? What claim had you to her more than I? Should I at this moment oppoſe you, if you were to ſupplant me, or even divide with me her affections? No; ſo much <hi>philanthropy,</hi> ſo much <hi>friendſhip</hi> do I feel, that though I was now going to her, you ſhall go in my place.'</p>
               <p>'Villain! monſter!' cried he, nearly choaking with paſſion; 'this moment I would tear your ſoul from your body, did not <hi>gratitude</hi> for your father prevent me. Live then! live to be a curſe to yourſelf and ſociety!'</p>
               <p>'Do you not know,' ſaid I, 'that <hi>gratitude</hi> is a crime? becauſe —'</p>

                  </gap>remember this. Nothing can be more fallacious than the philanthropic principles held out by mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern philoſophers: they paint themſelves as the moſt benevolent of the human race; they lament the horrors of Weſt-Indian ſlavery; they groan at the ſufferings of mankind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which ariſe from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of man and mortal exiſtence.

No, it is contrary to my principles, I will oppoſe them in every mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; and if a foreign enemy ſhould come, I will either be neutral, or rejoice to ſee the day that ſhall make us free. What is the meaning of this cant, let your own ſenſe dictate. Were theſe men to come forward and pay the regular taxes, there would not require above half that are now oſtenſibly demanded, the burden would be more equal, and the honeſt part of ſociety would not be cruſhed with more than their portion. This, Frederick, is probably the laſt time I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with you: it is <hi>gratitude</hi> which impels me to deſire your reform; and I would have you look at thoſe men, who have always the word <hi>morality</hi> in their mouth: look at the private life of any one of them, and you will find the liberty they ſeek to be no other than the right to practiſe every li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs unchecked by the <hi>law,</hi> and unſtigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed by ſober and religious men.'</p>

Do they not print cheap books to enlighten their underſtanding, and let them ſee how they are plundered and robbed<note n="*" place="bottom">It is to be lamented that the Government party do not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to counteract this method of propagating French principles, by diſtributing books of religious and moral duty</note>? For it is no argument to ſay, that from thoſe who have not, nor ever had any thing, nothing can be taken;—for what is more clear, than that I commit a robbery on a man if I with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his juſt demands? and the rich have no more real claim to their wealth, than the farmer has to the product of the ground he has cultivated; and which ought to be divided equally to all the people on the ſurface.

               <p>The arguments of Vernon might have weight on ſome minds; and I trembled to think that he was counteracting all the good which I hoped to produce in the vicinity. So dangerous an enemy to liberty and reaſon ought to be removed; and when I returned home, I immediately went to my father, deſiring him to withdraw his countenance from Vernon, who was a man that abuſed his gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eroſity.</p>

               <p>I CONTINUED my connexion with Amelia, and had the ſatisfaction to perceive that another human being would be added to the race of men. My father, by ſome means, became acquainted with the circumſtance; and I was catechiſed for having fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the dictates of nature. Family pride did not permit his requeſting me to marry her, though he pretended that his only objection was, that no union could be happy after ſo great a lapſe of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <p>'Let the pariſh provide for it,' ſaid I: 'all chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ought to belong to the public. The great, the immortal, the virtuous, and illuſtrious Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau ſent his children to be maintained by the Foundling Hoſpital at Paris<note n="*" place="bottom">Rouſſeau's Confeſſions.</note>: and ſhall I be

aſhamed of copying ſo great a maſter, whoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were all ſublime?'</p>
               <p>'And how do you reconcile thoſe principles with morality?' ſaid my father.</p>
               <p>'Morality,' I replied, 'is political juſtice, which prefers the good of the whole to the good of a part; ſuffering partial evil, that the great work of truth may go forward, and liberty and reaſon be paramount over ſelfiſhneſs, pride, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and prieſtcraft.'</p>
               <p>'Excellent! cried my father, breaking into a loud laugh: 'a ſpeech worthy the humble copier of Rouſſeau, and the great metaphyſician Stupeo. Let me aſk you one queſtion, Frederick—Do you underſtand yourſelf?'</p>
               <p>'Do I underſtand myſelf? Yes; and what I ſay is as legible as the broad beams of the ſun at noon day: it is written in the great book of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.'</p>
               <p>It was evening when this converſation took place: and we were ſtartled by a ſudden blaze of light, which darted acroſs the hemiſphere; at the ſame moment the ſervants cried out, Fire! and we could perceive the farm in a blaze.</p>
               <p>My father and I, together with the ſervants, haſtened to the ſpot, where we found a ſcene of deplorable diſtreſs. The farmer had forgot his children in his endeavours to ſave his property, which he threw out at the window.</p>
               <p>His wife had fainted away; and the younger chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were ſcreaming in an upper ſtory. My father, without any reflection, darted up the flaming ſtairs, and deſcended with the two little boys in his arms; in doing which, he was conſiderably ſcorched. Meanwhile, I ſnatched a ladder from one of the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:038973_0043_101282CB33ECD8C0"/>
men, with intention to reſcue Amelia, who had been ſleeping in her room, and now appeared ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified at the window. I was going to apply the ladder, when part of the roof fell into the room where her father was employed, and drove him to the window in danger of ſuffocation.</p>
               <p>In this dilemma it was impoſſible to ſave both: —'Were Stupeo here,' cried I, 'he would tell which is the moſt deſerving of life; but I ſhall commit ſome injuſtice, if I ſave the life of the one with the leſſer merit, ('Let go the ladder,' cried ſeveral; 'why do you keep it uſeleſs?') I, at that moment, remembered a parallel caſe, quoted by the excellent philoſopher, Stupeo, in ſupport of the new political juſtice.—'Suppoſe,' ſaid he, 'the Archbiſhop of Cambray and his maid are both in danger of periſhing in flames, which ought I to ſave? The maid, a ſtupid creature, little better than a brute;—the archbiſhop, a man of eminent virtue and learning, and the author of Telemachus.<note n="*" place="bottom">Godwin's Political Juſtice, page 84.</note> To ſave the one, at the hazard of my own life, is ſcarce more virtue than to ſave a dog; but to ſave the Archbiſhop, is an act of the higheſt virtue; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all actions are to be eſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eemed in exact pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the merit of the perſon receiving the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. Now the difficulty is, in the preſent caſe, to know whether the farmer or his daughter is of moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue to mankind. The farmer cultivates the earth, and provides for his family in a groſs kind of way: the daughter is young, and may add many to the human ſpecies: but then—'</p>
               <p>I was calmly proceeding, in ſpite of the ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles of the men to wreſt the ladder from me, when a tremendous craſh, and a large column of flame, ended my diſcuſſion, and I had the horror to ſee the
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:038973_0044_101282CE0172E150"/>
farmer and his daughter both overwhelmed in the burning ruins. I was ſhocked at ſo dreadful an accident, which would not have happened had Stupeo been there: but in this preſent raſcally ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of government and ſociety, virtue will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſucceed; and no man can be condemned, if evil ſhould reſult from a good intention.</p>
               <p>It was, however, a very deplorable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and I regretted deeply that I was not bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter verſed in the great book of Nature and Man, as I ſhould then have known inſtantly how to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate the ſeveral degrees of merit.</p>
               <p>Another unpleaſant circumſtance reſulted. The common people, who are like a ſwiniſh multitude, and cannot perceive reaſon, (how indeed ſhould they, when they are held in profound ignorance?) inſiſted upon it, that I had retained the ladder pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to ſuffer them to periſh: by which I expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to avoid the conſequences of my connexion with Amelia. My father himſelf was inclined to believe the report; and unleſs I had the logic of Stupeo, and the effrontery of Voltaire, (who being aſked how he could inſert falſehoods ſo glaring in his hiſtory, replied, 'To one half of the preſent generation they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A committee of ſtupid farmers met to inquire into the cauſe of the fire. It began in a back ſtable, where I had been on ſome buſineſs in the courſe of the day: their ſuſpicions appeared facts, and a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant was ſent for to apprehend me.</p>
               <p>I was very much aſtoniſhed when my father mentioned this with tears in his eyes, and told me the corroborating circumſtances were in every point againſt me: that my retention of the ladder was

               <p>I really did not ſee that any good would reſult from my being hanged; for how could I know what yet remained for me to perform on the great ſtage of life? and accordingly I haſtened from the houſe.</p>

               <p>I proceeded forward the whole of that night, and the next day I remained to reſt at a farm-houſe, again ſetting out at the commencement of evening. I had not advanced above ſeven miles, when I heard a conſiderable noiſe in a barn, like a tumult of applauſe, which again ſubſided into a calm; and I could hear a voice pronouncing a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamatory ſpeech. I haſtened to the door, which was guarded by ſome ill-looking fellows, and, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paid ſixpence, was uſhered into a croud of gaping farmers and cottagers.

               <p>'Have you ſubſcribed?' demanded he: 'Are you a member?'</p>
               <p>'I am a ſtranger, but I pretend to ſome little philoſophy.' He gazed upon me; and ſome friend ſtepping up, I was parted from him by the crowd.</p>
               <p>He is too much a philoſopher, thought I, to have his reflections interrupted by idle curioſity: he will now retire to meditate on the ſubject of his undertaking, and I will endeavour to ſee him in the morning.</p>
               <p>I proceeded towards the next village acroſs ſome fields, and, as I went ſlowly, was overtaken by two countrymen, who were in high argument.— 'I tell thee,' ſaid one, 'it be's a thing impoſſible as a labouring body ſhould yearn a pig in yan day.

               <p>My blood began to riſe in the cauſe of truth.— 'What,' cried I, 'would you have the human ſoul bound down and ſettered in bonds of ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ignorance?

               <p>The champion of Alderman Cromwell was too much irritated at this reply to enter deeper into the argument; and being alſo in a quarrelling diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition from the ſpeeches of his adverſary, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſtruck me over the head a blow which near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought me to the ground.

His antagoniſt attempted to collar me; but; darting my fiſt in his mouth, he ſtuck up to me in a more ſcientific way; and though I beat him black and blue in about ſix rounds, I was myſelf ſo bruiſed, that I crawled with difficulty to the next inn.</p>
               <p>Having procured ſome vinegar, or rather ſour beer, I retired to the chamber allotted me, which was in the upper ſtory, the roof admitting the ſparkling of the ſtars as they paſſed over. I lay down on a dirty piece of a bed, which the maid told me was all they had to ſpare, the reſt of the houſe being engaged by the London gentlemen.</p>
               <p>I was grieved at ſo fair an opportunity being loſt; but my bruiſes paining me, I found little inclination to enter into political diſcuſſion.</p>

Theſe very Romans pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to emancipate the people they went to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer; yet, when they had reduced them to the ſtate of dependant provinces, ſo heavy were the taxes they impoſed, that Rollin informs us, in the tenth volume of his hiſtory, page 136, that the people of Aſia frequently ſold their children of both ſexes to pay theſe republicans for procuring them freedom.

               <p>'You are right,' returned I. 'Mankind has hith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erto been in a ſtate of childhood, but the new philoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ophy will teach them to go without leading-ſtrings. Stupeo has demonſtrated, that when men are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently enlightened, their chains will drop off as by magic; every man will hail his fellow as his broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the copper-coloured Indian will claſp in his arms the white European.

               <p>'Your ideas are very ſtrange, I muſt confeſs,' ſaid he, 'but they are morally impracticable. If you deſtroy the arts, and return to pure nature, how will you teach men the new philoſophy? How will you prevent them from ſinking into barbarous ignorance?</p>

               <p>The fineneſs of the road invited the coachman to drive forward with celerity. 'The poor beaſts,' ſaid the gentleman, 'feel for our riding at our eaſe. I am aſtoniſhed that any of our modern nervous phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers make uſe of carriages.'</p>

The countrymen finding they could render us no more ſervice, begged ſomething to drink.— 'Come,' ſaid the youth to Adams, 'you would not work yourſelf, let us ſee your generoſity in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding the labor of others.'</p>
               <p>'For what?' ſaid Adams. 'It is the duty of every man to help his fellow-men; in fact, thoſe in diſtreſs have a right to demand it. To reward a man for doing his duty is unjuſt, becauſe it is a bribe to do what ought to be done: beſide, the money may be wanted for ſome act of charity, and the greateſt good is always to be preferred.'</p>
               <p>'You are right,' ſaid I, 'in theory, but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of things frequently infringe upon po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical juſtice: for inſtance, I employ a workman to make me a ſet of chairs, for which I appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ten pounds; this man is rich, and another who is poor, comes and tells me his caſe; political juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice commands me to give the ten pounds to the poor man, and let the other go without.'</p>

Poor Adams has a weak ſoul, he ſees clearly what is right, he feels the invigorating rays of truth, but his habits of trade drag him from the daring height, and ſink him again into all the prejudices attached to property.</p>
               <p>The inn where the ſtage was to ſtop was not the general rout for the ſtages; and it being only three in the afternoon, I determined to proceed on foot without waiting for the coachman, whom I had not paid for my journey, (but that was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing); I was not to be prevented by prejudice and common-place rules from following that free-will, which I poſſeſſed in my breaſt, for the direction of my actions.</p>
               <p>I ſtill felt the pains of my bruiſes, and walked forward ſlowly, admiring the beauty of the country, and reading the great book of Nature. I fell into a profound trance, and began to doubt my own exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which is very neceſſary, according to all phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, as we thence proceed in ſynthetic order to erect hypotheſis as upon a baſe. The faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hume doubted whether he thought he exiſted; but I went further, I doubted whether I doubted that I thought I did not exiſt, and from thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to eſtabliſh the axiom, <hi>Cogitas ergo ſum,</hi> I think therefore I am. I began to think that I did

               <p>A ſight ſo ſhockingly ſhameful to human nature, and the natural freedom of man, arouſed me to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſome noble exploit. I darted forward, and brandiſhed my cudgel—'What right,' cried I 'have you to impriſon your fellow man?

               <p>'That is nothing to the purpoſe,' cried I, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into patriotic frenzy, at recollecting ſome of the arguments of the great Stupeo, and the maxims of political juſtice. 'The man who profeſſes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ready to commit murder, ſeems to be ſcarcely a leſs dangerous member of ſociety than he, who having already committed murder, has no apparent intention to repeat his offence.<note n="†" place="bottom">Godwin's Political Juſtice, page 761.</note>—Unleſs this man appeared ready, and in a ſituation to repeat his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, political juſtice requires him to be left at his own diſcretion. He is no more likely to repeat the crime than any man here, for ought you can tell; and no man ought to be deprived of his liberty on preſumption.'</p>
               <p>'Pelt the madman,' cried ſeveral clowns, 'who ever heard ſuch nonſenſe? A murderer is not to be puniſhed for committing the crime, but appearing ready to commit it.'</p>

               <p>So ſaying, I ſeized the bridle from the man who held it, and the highwayman ſticking his ſpurs in the beaſt, rode over the conſtable, and would have gained his liberty, had not a ſturdy clown levelled a ſtone at his head, which brought him over his horſe; I was ſeized by ſeveral at once, and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding a ſtout reſiſtance, I was dragged like a ſlave, and forced againſt my will into an inn upon the road.</p>
               <p>Are theſe the laws, the deteſtable maxims of ſociety? cried I. Am I to be confined here as a priſoner of ſtate, for attempting to reſcue an injured man from the tyranny of the law? O that the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious day were come, when every man ſhall act from the divine impulſes of his will, and reaſon and liberty be acknowledged as the preſiding deities.</p>
               <p>While I was exclaiming to myſelf, a conſtable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and informed me, that as I was deemed either intoxicated or touched in the head, it had been agreed that on my paying five pounds as a compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to thoſe I had wounded, they would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter an action againſt me, otherwiſe I ſhould be ſent to the country gaol for attempting a reſcue.</p>
               <p>'Society,' cried I, 'I deteſt thy barbarous max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims and rights: what times! what country is this! where a man ſhall be impriſoned for an act of moral virtue in the eye of political juſtice, and be obliged to pay for his liberty? Dear, dear liberty! what are five pounds to thee? Here, take the money, and permit me to fly from the whole herd of mankind. O, my dear Stupeo, would that I could diſcover

               <p>'There is a return chaiſe for London at the door,' ſaid one of the waiters, 'are you going that way?'</p>
               <p>'Any way,' ſaid I! and following him, I entered the chaiſe, and was driven rapidly towards London.</p>
               <p>I always make it a rule to read the great book of Nature, and philoſophiſe as I go along the road; and I could not but be delighted to ſee the great book bound in green, with variegated edges of trees and flowers. Now, thought I, is this chaiſe an idea or a reality; I cannot prove it by argument to be real, it is therefore an idea, a whirling idea: now I have a very ſtrong impreſſion of this whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing idea; I wonder if I was to ſtep out into what ſeems an highway to my eyes (but which may be in fact the Red Sea), I ſhould ſtill continue whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to London. This was a very metaphyſical problem, which nobody but the faſhionable Hume, the conundrumic Berkely, or the great Stupeo could reſolve.</p>
               <p>The cries of <hi>No Popery</hi> rouſed my attention, and I perceived we were entering the metropolis. <hi>No Popery</hi> was written upon every houſe, and a parcel of ragged fellows, with <hi>No Popery</hi> chalked upon their hats, ſtopped the chaiſe, and demanded money<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>'For what?' ſaid I, 'I don't care any thing about Popery; a wiſe man will have no religion at all, becauſe the prejudices and narrow principles of religious ſects will prevent his mind expanding to the broad beams of truth.'</p>
               <p>'No gammon! —Tip us the grub!' cried ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral greaſy fellows. 'He's a Popery man! a Roman Catholic! and an enemy to the Church!' roared out others, while the words 'Go it! go it!' ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

around me, and a ſhower of mud and ſtones nearly overwhelmed me, ſmaſhing the glaſs of the chaiſe, and almoſt knocking down the driver.</p>
               <p>'You are a ſet of raſcally cowards,' cried I: 'will any man of you fight me: I will die in the cauſe of freedom.'—A ring! a ring! was ſhouted and formed; and ſtripping off my coat and hat, I threw them into the chaiſe, which drove away from the fury of the mob.</p>
               <p>There is ſomething generous in a mob; we there ſee the firſt germ of juſtice, generoſity, and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity; we ſee that a giant of a man ſhall not be allowed to annihilate a little one. It is true, that the love of novelty often inclines them to promote a quarrel where it might be reconciled: but no man ſhould be aſhamed to box in a juſt cauſe, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if he remembers the value of the pugiliſtic ſcience at Athens and Sparta: and why, becauſe I am better dreſſed ſhould I refuſe to enter the ring with a dirty antagoniſt, whom I may have injured? Whoever has read the novels of a very great dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſt, muſt be ſtruck with the beauties of boxing; an art, which I hope will ſuperſede the uſe of piſtols between jealous lovers and injured huſbands.</p>
               <p>A champion being found, he came forward with an aſpect horridly ferocious. He was a great-boned Iriſhman, and all the vile paſſions of human nature were written in his countenance. His ſavage ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance inclined the mob in my favour, who ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a long roar of applauſe when I intrepidly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I now had conſiderable advantage, and though I had three teeth jammed into my mouth, I broke one of his ribs, and levelled him with a full blow upon the ground, where he turned black in the face, and was left for dead.</p>
               <p>A hackney coach was inſtantly preſſed into my ſervice, and I was conducted by the mob in triumph to a public houſe, where they drank themſelves half drunk in the joy of my having conquered.</p>
               <p>Though I had at firſt been in conſiderable dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being murdered, yet my ſubſequent valour had rendered me dear to them all: ſo true is it, that pure human nature can diſcern truth when it deſcends to the level of their own ideas.</p>
               <p>I was here cleared of gore, and refreſhed with ſome cordials. I had loſt my coat and hat, and had not paid the chaiſe, which I knew not where to find; but theſe were mere partial evils.

familiarly up to me, and taking me by the hand, led me into a corner of the room.—'Are you engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?' ſaid he—'No,' I replied, 'I know of no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement.'—'I beg pardon,' he returned, 'I thought, by the clothes you wear underneath, you were one of us.'</p>
               <p>'I am always for the greateſt good,' I replied; 'in ſeeking a magnificent object, we are not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the means.'</p>
               <p>At theſe words he claſped his arms round me, nearly ſmothering me with ſoot.—'I know,' ſaid he, 'you are a man of education—all London will ſhortly be in flames, and the cauſe of mankind will be ſucceſsful.

               <p>I was on fire at the glorious idea of emancipating the victims of tyranny and oppreſſion, of opening the cells to the heart-ſick offender, who could not hope any redreſs from thoſe laws which condemned him.</p>

               <p>I DESCENDED amongſt the mob, and graſping a pole with blue colours, and the words <hi>No Popery</hi> inſcribed upon it—'Let us go,' cried I, 'my dear boys. No Popery! Lord George Gordon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever!' A loud and repeated huzza rent the air, and the prodigious maſs of people preſſed after me to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Newgate. I was aſtoniſhed in myſelf at the change of my fortune: I had but an hour before been in danger of being ſtoned by the very mob that, under my commands, would have made no ſcruple of ſetting London on fire. But ſuch is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the reward of great talents in moments of popular commotion; it is then great men are brought forward from obſcurity.</p>
               <p>Thouſands were already aſſembled before the auguſt depoſit of trembling victims: our reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was received with the triumphant ſhouting of
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:038973_0074_1012832D30B17058"/>
the patriotic bands, who felt the energy of liberty pulſating in every artery. The air was crimſoned with the flames of the gaoler's houſe, and his fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture was caſt into a bonfire, which ſparkled in my eyes like an offering to the Goddeſs of Reaſon, or like that glorious flame which conſumed all bonds and engagements when equality was eſtabliſhed by Lycurgus at Sparta.</p>
               <p>I haſtened to ſecond the attack upon this grand fortreſs, by leading my followers into Newgate-ſtreet, where, with ſledge-hammers, crows, and iron-palliſadoes, we ſoon broke an entrance into theſe deteſtable abodes, where the poor criminals were panting for freedom. With a high ladder, and in the ſight of thouſands, I ſcaled the lofty walls, exulting as I roſe at the glorious proſpect before us, and waving my colours as a trophy of conqueſt.</p>
               <p>We ſoon penetrated into the wards of this almoſt impenetrable building, which ſhort-ſighted politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians might have ſuppoſed capable of repulſing an invading army; but the energies of the people are irreſiſtible when determined on emancipation, and <hi>unoppoſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fire-balls and fire-brands ſoon ſet the timbers in flames. I ran from one ward to the next, and from cell to cell, ſounding the tidings of liberty, and receiving a thouſand bleſſings from thoſe tongues which had too often been turned to curſes and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations. Pick-pockets, cut-purſes, ſhop-lifters, and felons of every denomination, hailed the dawn of returning freedom, and ſprung forward to a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſummation, helping us to deſtroy this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tomb to all who deſpiſe the laws, and claim the natural privilege of dividing property.</p>
               <p>The flames raged and run with rapidity among the thick oak planking, which cracked with the
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:038973_0075_1012832FEF1A7CA8"/>
noiſe of thunder; the ſmoke and heat was nearly ſuffocating, and many in their over eagerneſs to clear the dungeons, fell martyrs in the glorious cauſe. In a cell which I had nearly overlooked, I found a miſerable wretch half naked upon the ground. I had broke open his door with an iron crow, and the firſt object that he ſaw was a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous blaze of light, which proceeded from the oppoſite wainſcot on fire. He had long heard the ſhouts of exulting thouſands, and the burſtings of the fire. 'Heaven and earth,' cried he, 'is the day of judgment come? or have I ſunk alive into hell? Are you a fiend?' ſaid he, ſtaring wildly, and ſtarting from me. 'Are you come to pitch me into everlaſting flames?'</p>
               <p>To ſay truth, my figure was not a little hideous, for I was covered with all ſorts of dirt, ſwelled in my face from the different bruiſes I had received, and ſtreaked with blood from a cut in my head by the falling of a plank: but how was I aſtoniſhed to perceive, by the light of the fire, the great Stupeo, the wonderful philoſopher, in chains.</p>
               <p>'Exult,' cried I, 'you are revenged, my maſter, my tutor, liberty has reared her ſtandard on theſe walls, and the fabric of ſelfiſh tyranny is tumbling about our ears. Haſte, get theſe irons off, and join in the noble cauſe of liberty and man.'</p>
               <p>Stupeo immediately ſtarted up, uttering incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent expreſſions of joy. I hurried him from the chamber of his ſtudies into the preſs-yard, where his deteſtable fetters were knocked off, and being refreſhed with a large goblet of wine from the cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the gaoler, we went into the ſtreet to enjoy the exultation of the ſurrounding multitude, and the moſt tremendous ſight that can well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; a ſight which awed the military into inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſtruck the magiſtrates into a panic of the
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:038973_0076_1012833306508038"/>
moſt puſillanimous nature: but cowardice is ever allied to terror, and I ſtood conſidering how beſt to exert the force now in action, that the greateſt blow might be ſtruck to the preſent deteſtable ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of monopolized property.</p>
               <p>Part of the army of patriots remained upon the walls, and dancing round the ruins to prevent every attempt at extinguiſhing the flames: the reſt followed Stupeo and myſelf, who encouraged them to perſevere and be free. The crowd would have deſtroyed Langdale's, a large diſtillers, in Holborn, but I repreſented that this was a paltry buſineſs, when we had yet to open the doors of ſo many gaols to the liberation of our brethren; beſides, we had already near four hundred felons amongſt us, and the augmentation of this force was a grand point, for who could fight for freedom like thoſe who had experienced its loſs? or who would level property like thoſe who had nothing to loſe, and all to gain.</p>
               <p>As we proceeded, every paſſenger was ſtopped and plundered, and from every houſe was collected, two or three times over, conſiderable contributions. I would have remonſtrated, but a fellow, who had been confined on a charge of murder, and whom I had liberated, ſwore he would rip me up alive if I attempted to prevent it; and indeed, though his argument was not in the line of reaſon, Stupeo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled me to the practice.</p>
               <p>'In revolutions and public commotions,' ſaid he, 'no man in Athens was allowed to be neutral: every man who does not fight for us, ought to be conſidered as againſt us and if we follow the new philoſophy, we ſhould ſhew no mercy to thoſe who ſupport the ſyſtem of deſpotiſm.'<note n="*" place="bottom">An article in the Jacobin Creed.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Having liberated the priſoners in Clerkenwell,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:038973_0077_10128336940D7028"/>
our forces were divided to objects of leſs moment. That diviſion under our direction proceeded to Lord Mansfield's; and there liberty and rational princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples received a complete triumph over all regular order. The muſty records of precedents, caſes and law, made a fire to warm the people they had ſo long enſlaved: I own I wiſhed to have preſerved ſeveral works of curioſity and art, but Stupeo would not ſuffer a thing to be taken—'Let them all pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh together,' ſaid he, 'we have yet remaining too much of art to be happy; let us not ſtain the cauſe with the appearance of ſelfiſhneſs.'</p>
               <p>'But why then,' ſaid I, 'are we to plunder the poor inhabitants? Surely it were better to ſupply ourſelves from ſtores like theſe?'</p>
               <p>'No,' anſwered he, 'can you not perceive that the deſtruction of property muſt be the grand aim; from thoſe who have little we muſt take that little, and the hoards of affluence muſt be utterly deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As long as one ſingle cart-load of property remains in any country, there will be no genuine equality.'</p>
               <p>From theſe ever-memorable exploits, I and Stupeo, with ſeveral ſelect leaders, retired to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure public-houſe, to contrive and arrange the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings of the enſuing night. I already fancied myſelf as great as the immortal John the Painter.</p>
               <p>At our meeting, ſeveral foreigners of <hi>liberal principles</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">The cant word for no principles but thoſe of profligacy, irreligion, &amp;c.</note> were preſent. A plan was propoſed for organizing the body of the people, and urging them to throw off the yoke of dependence, and declare themſelves free. A paper, entitled <hi>The Thunderer</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">See the Political Magazine for 1780.</note>, was drawn up by Stupeo, which he hoped would

kindle the glow of enthuſiaſm, and awake the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to their rights.</p>
               <p>The priſons were condemned to deſtruction, that none of our brave followers might be deprived of their liberty. The New-river water was to be cut off, that we might have the town effectually at command, and compel thoſe weak and obſtinate people who were afraid of joining our ſtandard. The Muſeum we fixed upon as a good depoſit for ſtores, after all that trumpery ſhould be burnt, which gives edge to a childiſh employment of time. The toll-houſes on the bridge we condemned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe bridges ought to be built without ſubjecting individuals to expenſe. The Eaſt-India ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes and the Cuſtom-houſe we conſidered as large lumber rooms for monopolizing property that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to every body.</p>
               <p>The Tower and the Bank were two grand ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, behind which we could entrench in defiance of the troops which were drawing towards the town from every quarter; and indeed our plans were too extenſive and grand for me to detail in minutiae.</p>
               <p>In the attack upon the Bank I was ſeverely wounded in the hand by a muſket bullet, for there the ſoldiers recovered their thirſt for blood, and fired upon the innocent people, who were gloriouſly fighting for liberty. We determined there to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer or die, being ſtrongly reinforced by the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough patriots, who had burnt the toll-houſes on the bridge in their rout. To place a juſt ſenſe of our cauſe before them, an horſe loaded with the chains of Newgate, was driven through the crowd in place of colours, and every breaſt beat with throbs of vengeance at the ſight.</p>
               <p>A body of ſavages on horſeback cut down ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral with their ſwords, and the infantry made uſe of their infernal muſkets, which ſeverely galled the

               <p>Poor Stupeo, who ſtood beſide me encouraging a band of thoſe, whom the ignorant call felons, to an attack on the infantry with iron ſpikes and bottles, received a ſhot that laid him dead beſide me. The mob, who now began to faint from the unequal conteſt, trampled over him, and hurried me along with them. I endeavoured to rally them, and one of them daſhed a link into my face, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by ſhooting him with a piſtol, for I had found a very good pair in an houſe we had gutted, and nothing could be more proper than turning the weapons of tyrants againſt themſelves.</p>
               <p>I was confounded at the fickle diſpoſition of a mob, which can only ariſe from their want of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; and ſo long as what is called civil order and police exiſts, I very much fear the people will never unanimouſly riſe: but, however, truth is making a rapid progreſs, and it muſt irreſiſtibly break forth into a glorious day.</p>
               <p>The mob would have executed ſummary juſtice upon me for the murder of the lint-bearer, had I not eſcaped through the narrow ſtreets into Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, where Langdal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Here the military deſtroyed a great number of patriots, who were dancing round the fire, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>umbling the furniture out at the windows; while many others fell victims to the half rectified ſpirits which ran in torrents through the ſtreets.</p>
               <p>I ſaw clearly it was a loſt cauſe, for want of a more regular organization, and I lamented that we had not made better uſe of the time allowed by the
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:038973_0080_1012833E09AF2428"/>
timidity (they called it humanity) of the government; we ſhould then have reduced the whole city to an heap of aſhes, from which liberty, like a phoenix, would have ariſen in ten-fold ſplendour: the maſs of luxury and of wealth would have been annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and the partial injury individuals might have received would have been amply compenſated by the new order of things which muſt have ariſen.</p>
               <p>It would have been, as Stupeo often ſaid, talking of revolutions, like the fermentation of anarchy, which from all the rage of luſt, of revenge, of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of cruelty, of rapine, and unheard-of diſtreſs, ſinks into a glorious and heart-ſoothing calm<note n="*" place="bottom">Paine and Godwin on Revolutions and Anarchy.</note>.</p>
               <p>Indeed nothing could be more dreadfully great than the appearance of London on that glorious night. The large body of fire iſſuing from the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent conflagrations of the Fleet Priſon, King's Bench, Toll-houſes on Blackfriar's-bridge, Mr. Langdale's two immenſe ware-houſes full of ſpirits, and a vaſt number of ſmall fires, together with the illuminations, which of themſelves would have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the ſtreets as light as day, all aſcending into the air, and conſolidating together, formed an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere of flames, impreſſing the mind of the ſpectator with an idea, as if not only the whole metropolis was burning, but all nations yielding to the final conſummation of all things. But how much greater muſt have been the ſight, amidſt which even the ſoul of a modern philoſopher might tremble, would it have been to ſee the flames chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the diſtracted people from ſtreet to ſtreet; to ſee the enemies of liberty periſhing in heaps before the burning ſword of retributive juſtice; to ſee the rage of luſt deſpoiling thoſe diſdainful beauties, whoſe love heretofore was only to be won by cring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; to ſee trembling tyrants biting the duſt, and

drinking their own blood as it mingled in the ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels; to hear amidſt all this uproar the thunder of cannons, the whiſtling of bullets, the claſhing of ſwords, the tumbling of houſes, the groans of the wounded, the cries of the conquerors; and ſee, amidſt the blazing and red-hot ruins, the ſons of Freedom and Liberty waving the three-coloured banners dropping with the blood of their enemies, and hailing the everlaſting Rights of Man!!!</p>
               <p>Ah! how dear muſt ſuch a ſcene be to the <hi>friends of liberty</hi> and <hi>univerſal man</hi>; nor ſhould the paltry conſideration of two or three thouſand being maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred, to ſatiate private revenge, be taken into the account of ſo great, ſo immortal a conſideration.</p>

               <p>I WAS ſo agitated by the failure of our glorious cauſe, that I was nearly putting a period to my exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, eſpecially when I recollected the ſhocking and infamous ſyſtem of a conſtitution, which none but fools can ſee <hi>any one</hi> virtue in; and this was, that every man who had ſuffered by this efferveſcence of liberty, would receive ſatisfaction for his loſſes, and thus the people would be made to pay for what they had deſtroyed; ſo that our failing in the ultimatum was worſe than if nothing had been done, and we

had in fact been ſtrengthening the laſh for ourſelves. To be ſure, there was this alleviating reflection, that the cowardly and ſelfiſh citizens would have to contribute equally with the patriots.</p>
               <p>I wiſhed myſelf away from ſuch a deteſtable country as England, where property is guarded with as much vigilance as if it were a deity; and no man, however obnoxious, can be plundered, without a right of retribution from the pariſh or county, a thing totally unknown in other countries, and quite inimical to genuine liberty.</p>
               <p>My wound, my bruiſes, and fatigue had nearly exhauſted my ſtrength; for till mind ſhall over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come matter, the human frame ſtands in need of repoſe and ceſſation from action, though it is aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing what exertions we are capable of, when the mind is engaged in great exploits; and I have little doubt, but when the new ſyſtem is eſtabliſhed, we ſhall have no need of what is called <hi>ſleep,</hi> nor ſhall we require <hi>food,</hi> both of theſe being ſuperfluous to <hi>ſpiritual ſubſtance.</hi> In fact, as my dear Stupeo ſays, why may we not one day become immortal<note n="*" place="bottom">One would be tempted to ſuppoſe the man inſane, who ſhould maintain that the human ſoul was a material ſubſtance, and had no exiſtence after death, but that he had no doubt when we had eaſt away our prejudices, we ſhould become <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal</hi> in this preſent world. Such conſiſtency is the doctrine of Godwin, Holcroſt, &amp;c. &amp;c.</note>?</p>
               <p>I did not regret the loſs of this prodigious great man any other than as ſociety loſt an invaluable member, for I had ſtrengthened my mind to the caſe, and ſhould, with the immortal Brutus, have looked with indifference on the death of any relation or friend, theſe being mere partial evils, and not to be ſeparated from extenſive deſigns.</p>
               <p>It is not politically juſt that a wiſe man ſhould expoſe himſelf careleſsly to martyrdom for the ſake or liberty, till he has well weighed whether the human

ſpecies will be moſt benefited by his life or death. To run raſhly on the point of a bayonet was wrong, becauſe I might yet live to illumine the world, and catch ſome glorious criſis—while truth would not receive any promotion by my death at the preſent inſtance: I therefore retired unnoticed amidſt the univerſal alarm.</p>
               <p>I was very little acquainted with the town, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been there only upon one or two vacations; but the light of the fires, and the brilliance of the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations were ſufficient guides. Several watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men looked as if they intended to ſtop me, but awed by the dignity of my countenance, though covered with blood and dirt, they all ſlunk away, ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful is the effect of innocence and impreſſive reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
               <p>I arrived oppoſite a bonfire, where the furniture of a Roman Catholic milliner was blazing; it made but a paltry light, compared with the many others that gleamed in the air; and the noble band that danced around it being aſhamed to be out-done in their patriotic exertions, in the goodneſs of their hearts dragged the bed from beneath two infants<note n="*" place="bottom">Political Magazine, 1780.</note> and a woman in labor, which gave a great, but tranſient addition to the fire. To be ſure, the poor woman died of fright, but that could not be helped in ſuch a caſe; and it is the ill-education of women which introduces all ſorts of nervous affections.</p>
               <p>In a little back alley I met an old woman carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething in her apron; at my approach ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very much frightened. 'What have you got there?' ſaid I. She replied, trembling, 'only ſome trifles, your honour, that I have preſerved from fire.' I required to ſee thoſe trifles. Accordingly ſhe opened her apron, diſplaying ſome gold fringe, a ſilver cenſer, and two cups, which ſhe had taken
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:038973_0084_10126F2DAE97BC00"/>
from a Romiſh chapel. 'You are heartily wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,' ſaid I, 'to theſe ſpoils of ſuperſtition; I wiſh you had as many more; but now, can you tell me where I may ſleep ſecurely from unwelcome intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders?'</p>
               <p>'Aye, and that I will: come to my little lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, my dear babe, you need not be frighted at no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body there.'</p>
               <p>Accordingly I followed her into a miſerable houſe, up three pair of ſtairs, into a back garret. A crucifix ſtood on a chimney-piece, and a ſtring of beads hung upon a nail, by which I ſoon diſcovered that this good lady, who had been plundering a chapel, was a Romaniſt; and I rejoiced to find that knowledge had reached even into a back garret, and taught an old woman to diſcern the cauſe of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind from the bigotry of prieſtcraft</p>
               <p>With this hoſpitable creature, who was an Iriſh woman, I determined to reſide. Being extremely jaded and pained by my bruiſes, I went immediately to bed, and ſhe haſtened to procure me ſome refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. She would have fetched a ſurgeon, but I utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deteſted the whole crew of leeches, who deal in a cant jargon (like the prieſts of Cybelle) which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body underſtands.</p>
               <p>When the fermentation of my ſpirits began to cool, in ſpite of all my efforts, I became nearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. I had loſt three of my teeth, and my whole body was bruiſed: the cut in my head, to be ſure, was only an inch and half long, and a finger deep; but I had a muſket wound in my hand, which had taken off half my little finger, and grazed the reſt, ſo that I was not in the moſt comfortable ſituation. I raved like a madman at the loſs of the noble opportunity, which might not occur in a whole generation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="74" facs="unknown:038973_0085_1012834A768C4390"/>Before morning I became wholly delirious, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a violent fever; and now it was the old woman introduced a lame apothecary from the neighbourhood. I was tortured, bliſtered, and blooded, and underwent worſe than a thouſand deaths in the courſe of three weeks, when I recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſenſes, and awoke as from a dream. I then learnt, to my infinite regret, that the kind old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had been taken up and hanged, adding anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to the long liſt of victims to deſpotiſm. The apothecary pretended that the old woman had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to criminate me reſpecting the ſtolen arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and that I ſhould have been taken up had he not ſworn I had been under his care prior to the riots; and it turned out, on the trial of the old woman, that ſhe had been ſeen alone entering the chapel.</p>
               <p>I reproved him ſeverely for his falſification of truth.—'Truth,' ſaid I, 'ought at all times, and in every ſituation, to be ſpoken.

               <p>'It is not too late yet,' replied he, 'if you have an ardent deſire to ſwing, but I thought you had the appearance of a gentleman.'</p>
               <p>To this obſervation I made no reply, being agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated with the loſs I had ſuffered.— All mankind,' cried I, 'would have ſeen an example of magnanim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity in the cauſe of freedom.

               <p>'We muſt take at leaſt three ounces more of blood,' muttered the apothecary, and went out of the room.</p>
               <p>I now plainly perceived that I had a raſcally, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, ariſtocratical apothecary, who meant to bleed me to death out of ſpite, that my name might for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be loſt to mankind.

               <p>'How could I have died both ways?' ſaid I. 'As to your bill, I have more need of the money myſelf, and the greateſt good is always to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred.'</p>

               <p>'But Sir, I have dedicated my life to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of medicine: I have no other means of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a living, and cannot afford to practiſe for noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.'</p>
               <p>'That is not my fault, it is the ill-conſtruction of ſociety.

               <p>'Sir,' ſaid he, humbly, in a vile depending tone, 'when you reflect, you muſt obſerve that you only exchange one benefit for another. In ſociety all muſt mutually hang together, and if any part be diſordered, the whole organization muſt ſuffer. Men have a variety of genius, and what would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of the world if thoſe who were willing to work gave all their labour for the benefit of the idle? All human genius would then be cramped, and directed merely to the providing of food.'</p>
               <p>'Peace, peace,' cried I, 'will you, an ignorant apothecary, a pounder of drugs, pretend to talk

               <p>'Well, Sir, pay me the trifle I require; it is only three guineas, and I have a numerous family.'</p>
               <p>'A family!' replied I, with indignation, 'and what buſineſs has ſuch fellows as you to get fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies? In the preſent ſyſtem, it is only bringing into the world a parcel of ſlaves.'</p>
               <p>'But population is the riches of a country.'</p>

               <p>I continued to take his drugs by way of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but I am ſatisfied I owed my recovery alone to the natural ſtrength of my conſtitution. I had daily accounts of the ſufferings of the perſecuted patriots; and I debated with myſelf what line of life I ſhould purſue as the moſt rational, and in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony with my principles.</p>
               <p>I reſolved not to ſtoop to my father; I could as ill cringe to any man in power, and I deteſted eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing in alliance with trade as a debaſement of the human ſoul. Surely, thought I, I am born for ſomething more noble than to meaſure goods, or ſort the articles of commercial exchange: low and baſe minds may find ſatisfaction in ſuch employ, but the intelligence which learned to ſoar into the realms of ſcience, muſt not be chained down to ſuch groveling undertakings.</p>
               <p>To amuſe my mind, I viſited a billiard-table which was at no great diſtance from my lodging, and I found ſome entertainment from the exertions of ſkill. I there became acquainted with the moſt good natured man in the world, whoſe name was Williams. I ſoon diſcovered that he was an advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for the new philoſophy; and he proteſted that he could not in conſcience accept a living in the preſent ſyſtem of things in any other way than by gaming. 'It is true,' ſaid he, 'the prejudices of mankind have ſtigmatized it as ignoble, but it is of all ſciences the moſt natural; it brings lords, and all thoſe titled trumpery, down to a level with the moſt inſignificant of men: it introduces a freedom of diſcourſe, it detaches the mind from all thoſe
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:038973_0090_10128359A084E3E0"/>
bigoted notions called religion: it equalizes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, by taking from the rich to give to the poor; and in one word, it is the moſt eligible way of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with honour and independence.'</p>
               <p>'You charm me,' ſaid I, 'I once thought gam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was a fooliſh method of ſpending time, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated merely for the introduction of vice and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation; I now ſee better, and it is to me ſingular how naturally the mind tranſides from one truth to another: but ſo it is with human nature. The progreſſion of knowledge is going forward with rapidity, and the wiſdom and experience of ages is diſcovered to be nothing at all in the eighteenth century.'</p>
               <p>Williams propoſed, that as I was what he called new to the town, we ſhould divide our gains, to which I readily agreed, and we were for ſeveral nights very ſucceſsful, ſo that I had to my ſhare near two hundred pounds. The tranſient ſtate of human exiſtence loudly urged me to graſp at the preſent; and my college habits returning with force, I fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſpent whole nights with drinking parties.</p>

               <p>I WAS charmed one evening at the play, by a beautiful young woman, who was in company with an ill-humoured, jealous-looking, <hi>illiberal</hi> man. I attempted ſeveral times to addreſs myſelf to the lady,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:038973_0091_1012835C766D8478"/>
but his ſevere looks and lowering frowns compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led her to reſtraint, and I did not wiſh to be the cauſe of increaſed domination.</p>
               <p>I was extremely well dreſſed, for in theſe trifles one may as well appear like the reſt of the world, though I had more than once an intention to adopt the Roman Toga, on purpoſe to attract attention, for theſe matters go a great way with little men. I found that I gained the attention of the lady, who appeared uneaſy under her reſtraint, and I made a ſecret vow, to emancipate her from the bondage under which ſhe groaned.</p>
               <p>I diſcovered, on further enquiry, that ſhe was the wife of a citizen, who had married her when ſhe was extremely young, and extremely giddy; that they had two children, and were as happy as a tyrant and a coquet can be in wedlock.</p>
               <p>I read over the Eſſays of the faſhionable Hume, where I found that adultery was one of the moral virtues, and perfectly agreeable to political juſtice. In volume 2, page 409, of his Eſſays, edition 1767, are theſe admirable words, which, ſingly, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected with his other excellent principles, would be ſufficient to raiſe the book into public notice.—'Adultery,' ſays he, 'muſt be practiſed, if men would obtain all the advantages of life, if generally practiſed, it would ſoon ceaſe to be ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous; and if practiſed ſecretly and frequently, it would, by degrees, come to be thought no crime at all.'—'Immortal Hume,' cried I, though thou doubteſt whether thou had'ſt a ſoul, I doubt whether it be poſſible to doubt that thou had'ſt a body.'</p>
               <p>I determined to follow ſo great an idea, and it was not long before I contrived an interview. It is needleſs to ſay the lady ſoon became a convert to the prevailing principles of reaſon and nature; ſhe was diſguſted with her ſlavery, and wanted only an
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:038973_0092_1012835E150AC7A0"/>
opportunity to exert the inborn freedom of her ſex. I engaged very neat lodgings for her, and began to enter into that ſtate, ſo congenial to the feelings of human nature and rational being. I found her a very ſingular character, within a truly feminine form; ſhe had a ſoul of maſculine energy; every thought of her mind ſeemed received by intuition. She was often right by this means, only in matters of mere ſpeculation; ſhe adopted one and rejected another, <hi>by a ſort of tact,</hi> and the force of a culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated imagination; and yet, <hi>though upon the whole ſhe reaſoned little,</hi> it is ſurpriſing what degree of ſoundneſs was in all her determination<note n="*" place="bottom">The reader may find many of theſe ſentiments in the Life of Mrs. Wolſtonecraft.</note>. My diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition frequently led me to waver in the practice I had adopted: I doubted, and I ſometimes feared; but my oſcillations and ſcepticiſm were fixed by her boldneſs. When a true opinion emanated in this way from another mind, the conviction produced in my own, aſſumed a ſingular character. She did not deſcend to all the frivolous ſoftneſs of her ſex, which cuſtom has rendered general. She ſaw in woman, a being in no point inferior to man, except in perſonal proweſs; and ſhe diſdained all thoſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions, which poets and mankind have generally combined in perfecting the female character.</p>
               <p>Our connexion was that of friendſhip; we only met when mutual inclinations prompted; and ſhe has frequently lamented, that the cuſtoms of the world prevented her mingling in all the purſuits and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings of men.—'Is there any ſex in ſoul?' ſhe would ſay, 'if not, what right have thoſe tyrants, the men, to exclude us from the ſenate, the bar, and the army? <hi>Do we not pay taxes in every article we conſume?—And who are our repreſentatives in Parliament?</hi>—It is an outrage againſt the inborn

Soldiers and women I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to be equally alike: the officers are perpetually attentive to their perſons, fond of dancing, crowded rooms, adventures, and ridicule: like the fair ſex, the buſineſs of their lives is gallantry: they are taught to pleaſe, and they live only to pleaſe; yet they do not loſe their rank in the diſtinction of ſexes, for they are ſtill reckoned ſuperior to women, though in what their ſuperiority exiſts, beyond what I have juſt mentioned, it is difficult to diſcover<note n="*" place="bottom">Rights of Women.

               <p>A woman of theſe ſentiments was congenial to my ſoul; our diſcourſes were a feaſt to the mind, in which the ſenſes had no ſhare. She frequently lamented the evils to which nature had neceſſitated her ſex in the article of children; a ſubject which ſhe never could diſcuſs with patience, it being an evil to which man was not ſubjected, and a badge of bondage not to be overthrown.</p>
               <p>'Oh! cried ſhe, one day to me, in a fit of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, 'what ſignifies all the freedom of our ſouls, all the exaltations of our intellects, if we are to be confined for months to carry a burden which we have no means to lay down, and when the little wretch appears in the world, what a dreadful idea: —with intellects that ſoar beyond the firmament, are we to be confined to ſwaddle and dandle an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal that has no ideas, and muſt at every moment deſtroy itſelf if we do not preſerve it? Oh horrid! that Nature did not provide ſome middle, ſome ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid, lumpiſh being, to rear and take care of the human progeny: why not make man an oviparous animal? Then we might have hatched the eggs in tempered ſtoves, as they do chickens in Egypt.'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="unknown:038973_0094_10128368893B0980"/>I could not but admire this flaſh of idea, which was bold and grand, and new; indeed, all her ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulations were ſublime, <hi>though ſhe reaſoned little.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">We are told in the Life of Mrs. Wolſtonecraft, that ſhe reaſoned little; thoſe who reaſon much will eaſily believe the fact.</note> I had nearly overlooked an unpleaſant incident, which would have very much grieved me, had it been occaſioned by me; but it was another dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſequence of the preſent organization of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and gave me an additional reaſon to execrate the prejudices of mankind.</p>
               <p>The huſband of my Mary had expected to find in her that ſoftneſs, complacency, and modeſty, which none but idiots ought to require, and which are merely calculated to fit a woman for a ſeraglio, or a play-thing to a voluptuary. He had taught himſelf to deſire a female, who might ſolace him after his buſineſs, with the endearments of a mind that had no will but his own, and ſought to oblige the man who preferred her to all her ſex. But Mary was of a different nature—her ſoul was not to be confined in a gilded cage, and ſhe would not bow to the baſhaw dictates of a maſter.</p>
               <p>The poor wretch became diſtracted at her loſs. In place of taking another, he was perpetually rav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about conjugal affection, the claims of children, the duties of wives, and ſuch ignorant prejudices, till his ſenſes ſailed him, and his friends ſent him to Bethlem Hoſpital. The children who had none to provide for them, were ſent to the work-houſe, to be educated by the public, where they caught the ſmall-pox, and died; an event, which ought natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to have been expected, when they had not been inoculated, and could not throw any blame upon the conduct of their mother.</p>
               <p>After this incident we continued on the moſt har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious footing, for though Mary allowed herſelf
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:038973_0095_1012836A21EA1930"/>
the converſation of many of the oppoſite ſex, I did not experience the ſmalleſt uneaſineſs, for ſhe had as much right as myſelf to all the <hi>excentricities of fancy</hi>; and I never thought her the worſe for having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the happineſs of other human beings.</p>
               <p>About a month after this, the poor huſband died delirious, one of the moſt ſtupid deaths a man could die, for the loſs of a woman: and Mary, thus freed from the ſhadow of a tie, appeared with me openly in public. Our neighbours made their uſual rude comments upon our intercourſe; and becauſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral gentlemen preſſed ſome handſome preſents upon Mary, they circulated the calumny, that I kept my wife as a proſtitute.</p>
               <p>I deſpiſed all this; I was not to be frightened into any act becauſe of ſcandal, and I had long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded marriage with ſo well grounded an appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, that, notwithſtanding the partiality for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that had taken poſſeſſion of my ſoul, I ſhould have felt it very difficult, at leaſt in the preſent ſtage of our intercourſe, to have reſolved on ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The human mind delights in variety. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible we ſhould be forever attached to one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular object.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my friend Williams, who certainly poſſeſſed very powerful attractions, and was an athletic fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure.</p>
               <p>I regretted this ſeparation, but was not fool enough to repine; and I determined, according to the maxims of the great Stupeo, inſtantly to ſelect ſome other; though it was difficult to find one with ſuch an underſtanding as to march forward to
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:038973_0096_1012836BE3D30D10"/>
the high gaol of reaſon, trampling down prejudice, ſuperſtition, and character, in its career.</p>
               <p>While I was in ſearch of ſuch a female, I wrote, by way of amuſement, a little tract, proving that girls ought to receive the ſame education as boys; that the ſame exerciſes ought to be purſued by each, and that beauty was not of the ſmalleſt value, when compared to a robuſt conſtitution, that feared nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wind nor weather. I proved, beyond contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, that every thing called the graces, ſuch as muſic, ſinging, dancing, timidity, delicacy, and baſhfulneſs, ought to be exploded.</p>
               <p>I know not how it was, but my book was only bought by a few; and the ariſtocratic critics con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned it, as the work of a man who paid no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to truth, provided he made himſelf ſingular: which was an abſolute libel, for I had loſt in the cauſe of truth, three teeth and half my little finger.</p>
               <p>I confeſs I did not underſtand the ſubject. When a man writes a book of <hi>methodical</hi> information, he does not write becauſe he underſtands the ſubject, but he underſtands the ſubject becauſe he has writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. He was an uninſtructed Tyro, expoſed to a thouſand fooliſh and miſerable miſtakes when he began his work, compared with the degree of profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency to which he has attained, when he has fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed it.<note n="*" place="bottom">Godwin's Enquirer, page 27.</note> In like manner, no man underſtands po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry or architecture, till he has written a poem or built a houſe.</p>
               <p>Frequently, by way of amuſement, I attended the ſix-penny debating ſocieties, where truth is propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in every branch, and religion and government attacked from behind a maſked battery. A debate on the beauty of a coquet, or the merits of a beau, was ſufficient to introduce annotations on deſpotiſm,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:038973_0097_1012836D8A3626A8"/>
and ſatires on nobility, to the edification of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and young, who are thus prepared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all the enlightened principles of the new ſchool. It is aſtoniſhing what energy reaſon poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, when adorned with all the flowers of oratory: and it was in vain that a man of narrow opinions ſhould endeavour to be heard; for let him ſay what he would, he was unattended to. I was, however, diſguſted at a little trifle, for I could not endure the ſmalleſt duplicity, which is beneath the dignity of man, and ought not to be permitted even in the promotion of general knowledge. This trifle was a quarrel between Citizen Cow and Citizen Calf, about which ſide of the queſtion they ſhould take: the one inſiſting that he could declaim beſt on the ſide of liberty, and the other declaring his own tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent lay in diſcovering faults. I was aſhamed that ſuch great men ſhould wrangle about the parts they were to act, like the performers of a country barn; and I could not but conſider, that the cauſe of lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty muſt ſuffer, when garbled by the palſied efforts of men, whoſe object was a dividend of ſix-pences, to be ſpent the ſame evening in a debauch.</p>
               <p>One evening, at the hazard-table, a young man, who had been ſitting near ſix and thirty hours, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted univerſal attention by the extravagant exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crations he uttered, and the agitation of his mind. He proteſted that he was ruined and undone to all perdition.</p>
               <p>My feelings are ever peculiarly alive to the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of my fellows, and though I endeavoured to guard againſt falſe pity, I am frequently melting at the diſtreſſes of my fellow mortals. I followed the poor wretch home at a diſtance, and entering his room abruptly, I found him ſitting in a chair, with a fine young woman hanging on his ſhoulder weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and a child ſleeping in a cradle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="unknown:038973_0098_101283734370C0A8"/>He ſtarted up confuſed at my entrance, and would have made an apology, but I ſoon tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized him, and preſſing him with the irreſiſtible argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of truth to rely on my ſervices, he confeſſed that he had wronged an excellent maſter to a conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable amount, under the fallacious hope, that by hazarding it at the gaming-table, he might acquire an independence, his ſalary being too ſmall to enable him to keep a family and appear as he muſt; that he had now loſt the means of concealing his crime, and ſhould bring ſhame on his wife and his relations by a public death.</p>
               <p>I was affected at the dreadful ſituation, for though his feelings were falſe, he having a juſt claim on his maſter's property, yet, in the preſent ſyſtem of things he would have all mankind againſt him; I therefore determined to let him have two hundred pounds, the whole amount of my caſh, which would cover his affairs for the preſent.</p>
               <p>Returning home, I met with Williams at the door of a tavern, and acquainted him with my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,—'You know my ſentiments,' ſaid I, 'and you know of what little value I eſteem property when it is conducive to good. I have not <hi>promiſed</hi> Jackſon, becauſe promiſes are criminal, but I think at preſent it is the greateſt good I can do, and I have raiſed his hopes from the edge of deſpair, by my aſſurances of ſuccour.'</p>
               <p>'But ſhall you not want it yourſelf, and how ſhall he repay it?'</p>
               <p>'Hear,' cried I, 'the profound ſentiments of the inſallible Stupeo, that moſt exalted of philoſophers. —My neighbour is in want of ten pounds which I can ſpare: there is no law to transfer my property to him, but in the eye of ſimple juſtice, unleſs it can be ſhewn that the money can be more benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially employed, his claim is as complete as if he

had my bond in his poſſeſſion, or had ſupplied me with goods to the amount. If two perſons ſhould offer, I muſt balance between them; it is therefore <hi>impoſſible for me to confer upon any man a</hi> FAVOUR, <hi>I only do him a right</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Godwin's Political Juſtice, page 89</note>·'</p>
               <p>'Stupeo,' ſaid he, ſolemnly, 'was a man of the moſt exalted intellect, he was a prodigy amongſt men, a meteor in the path of ſcience, which blazed for a time, but was too brilliant to be permanent. His language was ſuperior to all the groveling max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims of men, and his eloquence muſt have rivalled the perſuaſion of Cicero,'</p>
               <p>'I might ſay,' anſwered I, 'as Aeſchines ſaid of Demoſthenes, if ſuch be the effects of mere repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, what would you have ſaid had you heard himſelf?'</p>
               <p>'We regret,' replied he, 'the deceaſe of great men; but when their principles are practiſed by their pupils, we ought to be content. At this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I was ſearching for you, to throw myſelf into your protection, well aſſured that the juſtice of my claim will convince you. I have loſt this night ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery farthing I poſſeſſed, and I am now under im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate apprehenſion of an arreſt for two hundred and fifty pounds: I am even told the bailiffs have been after me. To be deprived of liberty, is more dreadful to me than death; I never will ſupport it; I am determined in my purpoſe, and it remains for you to conſider whether the ſaving of a rational being is worth two hundred pounds.'</p>
               <p>I felt myſelf in a diſtreſſing ſituation, and preſſed on both ſides by very urgent claims, the merit of which required reflection.—'My dear Williams,' ſaid I, 'more than ever I lament the death of the illuminated Stupeo; he would with one word have relieved our embarraſſment; but, tell me yourſelf,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:038973_0100_10126F4090D56AF0"/>
without any bias of prejudice or weakneſs, which will be the greateſt reſulting good.'</p>
               <p>We walked ſeveral paces in ſilence. 'At length,' ſaid he, 'I would not appear ſelfiſh. I ſwear it by my love of truth and political juſtice, that both theſe caſes are ſevere, but I do think that mine has the greateſt claim upon you.'</p>
               <p>'It is ſufficient,' ſaid I, 'you are right.' He accompanied me home, where I delivered him, within a guinea, of all I poſſeſſed. It was uſeleſs to viſit the young man when I could not relieve him, and I had no inclination to inſult diſtreſs. I was happy in having ſaved Williams from impriſonment, though the diſappointment Jackſon muſt endure in the failure of my offers now and then intervened, but I remembered that no man ought to place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon any but himſelf.</p>
               <p>I cannot remember the concluſion of this inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent without regret, and the reflection that philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy cannot always direct us amongſt the doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and mazes of human affairs. The young man was apprehended the next day, and his wife running forward to the moſt ſiniſter concluſions, caſt herſelf in the Thames, where ſhe was unfortunately drowned.</p>
               <p>I grieved, but grief was uſeleſs, after the event; I execrated the cuſtoms of mankind, and drew ſome comfort in remembering that I had probably ſaved Williams from equal calamity.—I haſtened to his lodgings, to pour out to him and Mary the tumults of an agitated ſoul, but I was informed that they had departed, before break of day, nobody knew where; and that a warrant was out againſt him for having cheated a gentleman with cogged dice.</p>
               <p>I was ſtruck dumb at this account, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me that I was a beggar; and the woman of the houſe hinted that I was implicated in the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:038973_0101_10128376C53AB6F0"/>
My mind was, however, clear of this aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; it was too manly to deſcend to other fineſſe than that of ſkill; but I could not reconcile the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of Williams to any maxim of truth or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical juſtice; for if there be not <hi>common honeſty</hi> amongſt thoſe the vulgar call rogues, how are the affairs of life to be conducted?</p>
               <p>The accidents I had witneſſed reſulting from gaming, had ſtartled my mind, yet I preferred it to binding myſelf a ſlave to the caprices of any man. This reſource was now become dangerous. No man from perſuaſion, would render me a portion of the ſuperfluities he enjoyed, and in the midſt of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety which calls itſelf poliſhed, I muſt either la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in employ, beneath the dignity of a ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al being, or periſh unpitied or unrelieved.</p>
               <p>Occupied with theſe reflections, I returned to my lodgings, abſorbed in a gloomy melancholy. Mankind appeared to me a ſet of ſelfiſh, ſolitary animals in the midſt of ſociety, and ſo far from being aſſociated for mutual protection, they ſeem only to live for themſelves.</p>
               <p>I remembered, in all its brilliance, the ſtate of nature, deſcribed by Rouſſeau, and enlarged by Stupeo. I repeated again and again <hi>Il retourne chez ſes Ega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>I DETERMINED to croſs the country of England to the North-Weſt, and propoſed to make obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon man in my journey; for, as ſome writer has ſaid, that ought to be the object of all voyages and travels; and, as Pope ſays, "The proper ſtudy of mankind is man." Indeed, man may be ſaid to compoſe the firſt chapter of the great book of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and before we pretend to a knowledge of all the chapters of that large book, we ought ſurely to be maſters of the firſt.</p>
               <p>On the ſixth day of my journey, for I walked on foot, towards evening I arrived on the borders of an extenſive waſte; a large crowd of country people were aſſembled, and in deep debate about ſome new encloſures, which had ſhamefully infringed upon the common right. Some gentlemen were endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouring to perſuade them, that by cultivating the uſeleſs ground, larger crops would be produced, which would create greater plenty, and render the articles of life cheaper.</p>
               <p>All my patriotiſm was rouſed at the glaring im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and taking advantage of a mound of earth, I requeſted to be heard.</p>
               <p>'Can you liſten patiently, citizens,' cried I, 'to this deteſtable doctrine? Do you not know that the ground which now ſcarcely ſuſtains a gooſe, will then fatten an ox, and thus your oppreſſors will be enriched, and you will be ſtarved?

Now is the time; a moment's delay, and you will be too late. Unite and tear up the fences, level the hedges before the cultivating ſpade has turned up the ſod. Would to heaven there was not a ſingle acre cultivated, and the then imperious rich would not monopolize proviſions. I ſee impatience in your eyes—I ſee the riſing flame of liberty and truth flaſh in your countenances.— Come then, down with the boundaries, thoſe badges of ſlavery, and tell all the world that you have as much right to the ſurface of the earth as you have to the air.'</p>
               <p>This ſpeech was like an electric ſhock, every man confeſſed its truth, and the triumph of patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm was complete. In vain the gentlemen endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to argue down the ſtorm; <hi>no one would hear them;</hi> a plain demonſtration that their <hi>arguments</hi> were falſe. I tore up, with my own hands, one of the ſtakes, and in an inſtant the ariſtocratical en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures were laid open again in a ſtate of nature.

               <p>While I ſtood witneſſing this tranſient ſtart of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergetic freedom, I was ſuddenly ſeized by three of the gentlemen, and though I made a ſtrenuous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance was ſoon overpowered.

               <p>I was chagrined, and as they led me on, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed aloud, 'Raſcals and cowards, is this the manner to treat a pupil of the great and immortal Stupeo?

'We have here one of thoſe ſeditious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors that go about the country deſtroying its peace, and telling palpable lies in a flowery lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which warms the paſſions, and runs away with ſober reaſon.'</p>
               <p>'My Lord,' ſaid I, 'I am glad to ſee you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you ſhall be a judge of the ſubject in diſpute, and for which I am dragged along the public road like a traitor and a ſlave. What is truth? Can any circumſtance change the immutability of its nature? Is it not like thoſe mathematical axioms, which we only enquire to hear to underſtand? Think you that the ſenſes of the people are ſo dull, they do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the light of truth when it flaſhes in their eyes? Or, as the ſublime Stupeo would have ſaid, when truth, like a volcano, burſts forth on the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of night—its thunderings ſhall awaken the dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant ſenſes of mankind—its lightnings ſhall glitter in their eyes like the brilliant morning of ſcience— its lava ſhall bear down all oppoſition, over-whelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the puny barriers of ſtate—its cinders will ſcatter deſtruction upon its enemies, and the devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſpreads (like a revolution) ſhall be momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, giving place to a tenfold fecundity.'</p>
               <p>'But,' ſaid his Lordſhip, 'not to queſtion the <hi>truth</hi> of your bombaſtic metaphor, you forget that this <hi>devaſtation</hi> would ſweep away all the then gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration.'</p>
               <p>'And what is one generation,' I returned, 'or what are ten generations to the reſulting good? Are we always to be as imbecile as infants? I have no doubt, that when reaſon acts in all things, we ſhall live to the age of the primitive parents of mankind, and then we ſhall not tremble at revolutions.'</p>
               <p>'Oh that the glorious days were come!' ſaid he with a ſneer, 'when the dagger and the rope ſhall

loſe their deſtructive qualities, when the muſket, the ſword, and the pike ſhall rebound from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of the patriot, and the cannon ball, in place of flying onwards, winged with death, ſhall fall harmleſs to the ground—then, and not till then, ought we to ruſh into revolutions.'</p>
               <p>'But truth,' cried I, 'truth is omnipotent, of which this very day is an example.'</p>
               <p>'Which way?' ſaid he. 'I know you have ſenſe, though at preſent it is warped. You call by the name of truth that which ſtimulates ignorant people to outrage: but you forget that all men are not cool philoſophers, that the great maſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are enamoured of novelty. The very buſtle of a riot or a revolution has for them equal charms with a horſe-race or a bull-baiting, and the merits of the ſubject are never diſcuſſed till they ſmart un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the conſequences. What can be more eaſy than to lead people to deſire to live without labour, to plunder the rich, and pay no regard to thoſe laws which were made purpoſely to reſtrain the paſſions? And becauſe this is eaſy to be done, you call it truth and liberty, and patriotiſm. But I would aſk one ſober queſtion, and would to God the whole world could hear me. If ſimple nature, poverty, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality is the natural ſtate of man, why do reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers wiſh to deprive the rich of their wealth, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the poor unhappy? A plain argument that all they want is to plunder the rich, and, under a maſk of mock patriotiſm, deſtroy all thoſe ſacred bonds which give energy to genius, and encouragement to virtue. If they have the real welfare of mankind at heart, in the eſtabliſhment of equality, and deteſt (as they are always pretending) cruelty and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, it would be very eaſy to eſtabliſh themſelves in America.'</p>

                  <pb n="96" facs="unknown:038973_0107_1012838C6D3EDAF0"/>'But monopolizers,' cried I; 'are they to be ſuffered to prey on the entrails of ſociety? What right has one man to eat a pine-apple, for which he gave a guinea, when another is ſtarving for want of an half-penny worth of bread? Anſwer me this —.'</p>
               <p>'Few things can be more eaſily done,' replied he. 'In the firſt place I would obſerve, that the incident never happened but in imagination, drawn for the purpoſe of caſting an odium upon the rich, they do not in general deſerve. Secondly, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulation of individual property is the natural and certain conſequence of ſociety. It is to be ſeen in the ſtate of ſavageiſm, where an induſtrious Indian ſhall poſſeſs good arms, while an idle one ſhall be almoſt without. In the ſtate of equality, that is, ignorant barbariſm, no pine-apples would be culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated. How many depend for their ſhare of the guinea paid for the pine-apple? The fruiterer, the gardner, the glazier, the carpenter, the bricklayer, the ſmith, the coal-merchant, the mariner, the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with all the crowd of others who ſupply each of thoſe individuals with materials; and when you ſhall have divided the guinea between all theſe, I think the gentleman may eat his pine-apple with a good conſcience, unleſs you can prove that he ought to give half of it to the vagabond, who will not work to provide himſelf food.—To ſtate your queſtion right, you ſhould aſk which is the greater good, to aid all thoſe tradeſmen and their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, by encouraging the luxury, or to give the ſuperfluous guinea to the ſupport of unproductive idleneſs? There is another queſtion frequently aſked—What right, ſay they, have the rich to tax the poor? What right have they to live by the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the poor? The real fact is, that they do not live by the labour of the poor, but <hi>vice verſa;</hi> for
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:038973_0108_1012838E0AA4CAE0"/>
were there no high people to pay the poor for working, there would be no work done. What bricklayer would build a houſe without being paid? What labourer would work for him without hire? <hi>The benefit is reciprocal to both parties;</hi> but, to ſpeak a truth, the rich, wrapped as they are in eaſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence, would do much better without the poor, than the poor without them. As to taxes, the poor in this country pay very few in proportion to the rich; their cottages are exempt, they are not vaſſals who work without pay (as in moſt countries of the world,) and thoſe who wiſh to live in peace, may do it with as much ſecurity as a lord; their perſons and their little all are equally ſacred in the eye of the law, and except in the article of game, <hi>equally free.</hi> It is the drunken, the idle, and the vicious, who have their families ſtarving, and a burden to the pariſh. But ſuch is the ſingular conſtitution of the country, that no Engliſhman can die of abſolute want, if he will appeal to the charitable inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. In fact, it is the middle claſs of people who bear the great burden of the ſtate: the poor are exactly the ſame as they were a thouſand years ago, and were, and will be always the ſame under every form of government, with the exception of perſonal freedom and protection. It is to be remembered that taxes ought never to be murmured at, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they are applied to public affairs. I am, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, grieved when I reflect that the upright, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and loyal citizen pays at leaſt one third more than his juſt portion, to make up the deficiency oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by the ſneaking, miſerly part of the rich<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and by the mock patriot evading every impoſt he can flinch from—thus ſtabbing the country he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to weep over.'</p>
               <p>'But,' replied I, 'it is a groſs and ridiculous er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, to ſuppoſe that the rich pay for any thing:
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:038973_0109_10128390EB882658"/>
there is no wealth in the world except this—the labour of man, <note n="*" place="bottom">Enquirer, page 175.</note>ſo that when a man of property pretends he is rewarding the labourer, he is cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, he is giving him a bauble, and cajoling him. If he employ them in erecting palaces, in ſinking canals, &amp;c. it will be found he is their enemy; he is adding to the weight of oppreſſion, and the vaſt accumulation of labour, by which they are already ſunk beneath the level of brutes.'</p>
               <p>'From this doctrine,' ſaid Lord B—, 'it follows, that the leſs employ given to mankind, the greater is their happineſs, and the greater your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence; and the Eaſtern Baſhaw, who graſps every accumulation of property, deſtroys the ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of commerce, arts, ſciences, and agriculture, reducing men to the happy ſtation of providing no more than juſt ſufficient to ſupport exiſtence, is, in your ſyſtem, the benefactor of the human race.'</p>
               <p>I know not how it was, I felt all my ideas unor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized, and I endeavoured in vain to reply: though what could be more <hi>trite,</hi> illiberal, and common place. The country people who had liſtened to this diſcourſe, one and all proteſted they were griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at their offence, declaring, that they now ſaw plainly how much better it was to receive the wages for their labor in cultivating the ground, than to keep it barren, and of uſe to nobody, at the ſame time offering, the next day, to replace the hedges they had thrown down.</p>
               <p>'And to conclude this adventure,' ſaid the young nobleman, 'let this unfortunate man be liberated; and I hope he will yet be convinced of the folly of deſtroying one ſyſtem, which has <hi>ſome faults,</hi> with <hi>many beauties,</hi> and in its place propoſing another, which has not one ſingle <hi>practical beauty,</hi> but is pregnant with the moſt deteſtable and dreadful evils.'</p>

                  <pb n="99" facs="unknown:038973_0110_1012839288E275B8"/>Being at liberty to proceed on my journey, I left Lord B— and his train of ſlaves. Continuing along the road by moon-light, and having leiſure to recollect the apothegms of Stupeo, I was angry with myſelf that I had not contradicted every aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by Lord B—, and proved that his reaſonings were falſe in <hi>toto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I was rouſed from theſe reflections by the creak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a gibbet on the highway, and could not avoid ſhuddering at the inhuman ſpectacle.</p>
               <p>'O property!' ſaid I, 'this is one of thy bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed effects—what a dreadful exhibition of injuſtice glares upon the thinking mind, that death ſhall be the fate of the man who by force exerts the rights of nature. In the principles of Penal Law, we are told near an hundred perſons annually are exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. Oh ye victims of this infernal monopoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing ſcheme, the whole amount of the goods (vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly called ſtolen) is only threefourths per cent. upon moveable property, yet they hang you up on the highway. Perhaps you were obliged to ſhoot ſomebody in ſelf-defence, and muſt ye die for that? Can we wonder at the miſeries of ſociety, when luxury and trade are riſen to ſo enormous an amount, that the aggregate of property brought to the city of London, and moved in floating bottoms only, is annually ſeventy millions, out of which only about four millions are taken in plunder, only four millions reduced to the laws of equality. There is, indeed, a bright gleam breaking through this dark picture, which enables the private patriot to tax the property of theſe dealers in wealth; this is the article of <hi>baſe coin,</hi> amounting, it is true, to no more than one million a year<note n="*" place="bottom">See the excellent Treatiſe on the Police of the Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, which, though certainly exaggerated in ſome of the calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, deſerves the attention of every man.</note>. Let us a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:038973_0111_1012839820622940"/>
contemplate this mighty Coloſſus of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which threatens to devour up the Rights of Man, and reſiſt all the open and ſecret attacks of philoſophers, and we ſhall ſee how neceſſary it is by every means to render property leſs ſecure. Let us reaſon calmly, and without prejudice, and to any man of liberal ideas, what is the moral turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of robbery? It is no more than taking by force what I have a natural right to: it is an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic and generous way of exerting the claims of nature and Agrarian juſtice; and the hazard I run is the ſame as every patriot muſt lay open to, who excites revolutions, and proclaims the glad tid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of univerſal emancipation. The one, as well as the other, is deteſted by all men who are blinded by religion, and the prejudices of the old ſchool. It becomes, therefore, the part of every patriot, who would nobly reſiſt oppreſſion, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin by counteracting the unjuſt diſtribution of property; and were they all to a man boldly and heroicly to ſet out on the high road, they would ſoon render wealth leſs ſecure, and its poſſeſſors leſs arrogant. It may be objected, that this would not be ſo manly as at once throwing off the yoke of bondage: but till the <hi>march</hi> of ſentiment has proceeded to univerſal conviction, the next great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good ought to be preferred to liſtleſs inactivity.'</p>
               <p>Such were my reflections while I ſtood gazing at the gibbet: I ridiculed the idea that it would act as a reſtraint: it was in my eyes like the mangled body of Caeſar, which only ſtimulated to revenge. I conſidered the poor victim as unjuſtly maſſacred by the iron-fiſted law, for though he had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted murder, that was no reaſon for coercion in the code of political juſtice.</p>
               <p>My mind was impreſſed with a majeſtic and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent tone, reſulting from thoſe ideas. I felt
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:038973_0112_10128399BB06FE10"/>
myſelf rouſed to ſome arduous exploit, and a poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaiſe driving towards me, gave me an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to emulate the valour of an Alexander, or a Charles the Twelfth.</p>
               <p>I drew out my piſtols, and marched forward along the middle of the road, which the poſtillion perceiving, ſpurred his horſes, with an intention to ride over me. With a ſtroke of my oak-ſtick I brought him down, and graſping the reins, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the horſes. The gentleman immediately fired, and miſſing me, I returned the ſhot, and a loud ſcream from a female cauſed me to think it took place. The horſes taking fright, tore away from my graſp, and rode over the poſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, who was much bruiſed, and had one leg broke.</p>
               <p>This unfortunate accident extremely chagrined me, but I conſoled myſelf as much as poſſible with remembering, that partial evil will ever attach to general good. The <hi>immortal</hi> Stupeo, before he died, uſed to obſerve, that nature in her fecundity, produced all things in ſuperfluity, that much might be ſpared for the deſtruction of accident, as in the produce of animals and vegetables; and man, being nothing but a brute, was alſo ſupplied in greater numbers than ſufficient; in fact, that the death of two or three hundred thouſand was a matter of no moment, and abſolutely unworthy to fill the mind's eye a ſecond in the contemplation of a great event.</p>
               <p>Theſe arguments were clear as the broad baſe of truth; for what man could walk out on a ſummer's day, if he feared cruſhing the inſects in his path? Or who could look coolly upon a revolution, if they valued the lives of individuals, who muſt be cruſhed by the ebullitions of the moment<note n="*" place="bottom">The reader muſt obſerve the difference of the Vagabond's ſentiments, which is the exact language of modern Jacobins.

                  <pb n="102" facs="unknown:038973_0113_1012839CF1EC9808"/>I rejoiced that my mind was ſuperior to preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and continued forward, after this little acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, with an high flow of ſpirits. I was on foot, and walked ſlowly on, forgetting, that by this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage (as it is vulgarly called) I rendered myſelf lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to account, when I heard behind me the clatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of horſes. It was totally dark, and ſtepping a little from the road, that they might not run over me, I ſtuck in a muddy ditch on one ſide.</p>
               <p>The ſplaſhing I made to clear myſelf caught their ears, and they quickly ſurrounded me ordering me to ſurrender. I was in no ſituation to contend, for I could not extricate myſelf. I threw my piſtols over the hedge into a thicket of whins, and replied, that they might uſe me as they pleaſed, for death was infinitely preferable to ſlavery.</p>
               <p>I was conducted back on horſeback ſeveral miles, to the neareſt inn, where I was uſhered into a large kitchen. It was now very late being near three in the morning, ſo that only two maid-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants were there, with the three perſons who had caught me. One, who had the appearance of a gentleman, turned me to the light to examine my features, when I inſtantly knew him to be my father.</p>
               <p>'Great God!' exclaimed he, 'who do I ſee? What dreadful fate is this? Why did I not die before I had beheld this hour? But for a trembling hand I ſhould have killed my ſon! and that ſon would have been ſpared the guilt of murdering his mother!'</p>
               <p>A cold damp ſweat gathered on my brow. I was unmanned in a moment, notwithſtanding

               <p>I could not but execrate the whole ſyſtem of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male education, which thus enervates the human body; it being an eternal fact, that were women educated to all the exerciſes of men, and, as my dear Mary uſed to ſay, ſo mingled with the world, that every action would he performed promiſcuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, (ſex out of the queſtion) we ſhould not have wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men fainting on ſudden emergencies, and as imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile as infants.</p>
               <p>What a glorious thing would it be, if the whole female ſex would emancipate themſelves from thoſe tyrants the men, and enter equally into every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern

of life! We ſhould then no longer admire a beautiful idiot, but value them according to their mental charms and perſonal proweſs. It would alſo be a very great advantage in the article of love, it being no inconſiderable trouble to a philoſophical mind to bend to all the frivolities of declaring a paſſion.</p>
               <p>By the exertions of my independent principles, I acquired a ſufficient ſubſiſtence; but I always made it a rule never to put in my claim to a part of the univerſal ſtock, till neceſſity (which has no law) in ſome ſort compelled me. It was on one of thoſe occaſions I had the good fortune to meet with you, and I only lament that the immortal Stupeo was killed with a muſket bullet.</p>
               <p>'I lament too,' ſaid Doctor Alogos; 'I ſhould have delighted in the converſation of ſo great a man, who has introduced ſo enlightened a pupil to the world. But let us now retire to reſt; the clock has ſtruck three, and to-morrow we will diſcourſe further.' So ſaying, they ſeparated for the night: Frederick rejoicing that he had at length found a man illuminated with the irradiating principles of the new philoſophy; which he the more wondered at, conſidering the Doctor's <hi>property,</hi> for he had found the pupils of the new ſchool, in general, a little ſhort in financial affairs.</p>
               <p>The next morning the company met to breakfaſt. Laura was extremely lovely; and the eyes of the philoſopher frequently repeated the obſervation. Suſan ſat down familiarly to breakfaſt with them; and the luxury of the times was ably deſcanted upon.</p>
               <p>Tea and chocolate, new bread and freſh butter, with a reliſh of cold ham and eggs, compoſed the breakfaſt of theſe practical philoſophers.</p>
               <p>'Luxury,' cried Doctor Alogos at every mouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, 'will be the bane of this country; every thing

riſes to ſo enormous a price, that a poor man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abſolutely get an exiſtence; we ſhall be ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!'</p>
               <p>'It is a dreadful thing' to think of it,' ſaid Fred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erick; 'I have often conſidered what could occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſuch a riſe in meat, for inſtance; formerly we uſed to have the beſt beef at one penny a pound, and now it is ſixpence.'</p>
               <p>'I apprehend,' ſaid Laura, 'that there are two reaſons: the increaſed conſumption, and the increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed quantity of money. Formerly, a farmer, before he killed an ox, had to contract with ſo many fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies as could purchaſe the whole, not being able to place a dependence on chance cuſtom; a fact that muſt give the lie to the tales of ſome people, who would make us believe that day labourers fed upon roaſted beef.'</p>
               <p>'You are a little perverſe jade,' ſaid the Doctor, 'to dare contradict a man like me. Pray, how ſhould you know what uſed to be, who have not yet ſeen eighteen ſummers?—You are a moth in the creation yet, I inſiſt upon it that our peaſants are ſtarved and famiſhed:—Are not potatoes and bacon half their ſupport?—Anſwer that.'</p>
               <p>The Doctor enjoyed the triumph of rhetoric over common ſenſe; but Laura, with becoming defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, replied, that it might be true, but that was even better than ſkimmed milk and oatmeal cake, which was formerly the general food, with a change of barley and rye. 'The people of England, then,' ſaid ſhe, 'were ſubject to leproſy and cutaneous diſeaſes, which have vaniſhed ſince the introduction of tea. I grant that they live hard, but it is what they have ever done; and were it poſſible for them to ſee the peaſants of other countries, they would rejoice at being people of England.

landed gentlemen on the continent, let us look at the eaſtern nations, whoſe lower orders live upon nothing but rice, and particularly the Chineſe, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, in the Annual Regiſter for 1789, to contain <hi>two hundred millions</hi> of people, whoſe lower orders, in-land, taſte nothing but rice and water, and on the ſea-coaſt a little fiſh.'</p>
               <p>'Rice and fiſh!' ſaid the Doctor, 'I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded they are both primitive diſhes. Rice is the food of more than half the human ſpecies, and ſava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges on the ſea-coaſts univerſally eat fiſh.

               <p>'For my part,' ſaid Frederick, laying a ſlice of ham on his bread and butter, and putting three lumps of ſugar into his cup of chocolate, 'it is to me a matter of the greateſt indifference what I eat; I eat merely becauſe it is right to eat for the keeping our bodies in order. A family phyſician proves, that one half the neceſſity of eating is to diſtend the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines; for which purpoſe, any farinaceous paſte is ſufficient; and I have an intention to try a pud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of <hi>marble flour;</hi> for, if this proves true, what great exploits may be performed without the trouble of carrying bread!'</p>
               <p>'For heaven's ſake!' ſaid Laura, laughing, 'forego the experiment, or the images of Jupiter and Juno, in the garden, will be made into haſty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudding; and the arm of Venus will have as much temptation as an haunch of veniſon.'</p>
               <p>After breakfaſt, the Doctor requeſted Frederick to walk in his garden, and help him to weed ſome beds of herbs.</p>
               <p>'Do you think,' ſaid Frederick, 'after what I have told you, that I will degrade my dignity by a
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:038973_0120_101283B3B4E1C3F8"/>
menial employ? that I will become a ſlave to till the ground?'</p>
               <p>'No,' replied the Doctor; 'you are a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher; I do not propoſe to you any ſuch thing; but huſbandry is a primitive art, and no diſgrace when practiſed for exerciſe. I propoſe that we ſhall live together on a footing of equality, and that we ſhall endeavour to enlighten the people in our neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, erecting to ourſelves a little republic.'</p>
               <p>'The idea is grand and noble,' cried Frederick: 'had we Stupeo here, his whole ſoul would enter into the ſubject. Let us begin this very day—only let me obſerve, I will be entirely independent.'</p>
               <p>'Of courſe,' ſaid the Doctor.—'Though I very much fear we ſhall never bring them to the ſtandard of nature. This iſland is the ſink of ſlavery. The very elements won't let the people go naked like the Indians of America. What ſhall we do firſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bringing about the freedom of man?'</p>
               <p>'The firſt great action to be performed, is to convince them of their wrongs—to ſhew them they ought to govern the ſtate; and that, if they do not recover their rights, they will be ſtarved and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved; and that all diſtinctions are badges of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and not rewards of merit.'</p>
               <p>'But in that point,' ſaid the Doctor, 'it appears to me cheaper to beſtow titles and ribbons than penſions—if there were no titles, the penſion-liſt muſt increaſe.'</p>
               <p>'And ſuppoſe it did,' cried Frederick, 'are we going to do away all profits and rewards? Every man ſhould labour for the reſulting good.'</p>
               <p>'Right, right,' anſwered the Doctor. 'But ſhould we not ſay ſomething on the article of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage? We ſhall never introduce real liberty till we can do away that Gothic barbarity. There's Suſan, a good deſerving creature, juſt ſuch another as

               <p>'Hear,' ſaid Frederick, 'the ſentiments of the great philoſopher Stupeo: When the diſtinctions of ſociety ſhall be confounded, and men ſhall ceaſe to appropriate a whole female to themſelves—<hi>two</hi> men might eaſily enjoy one woman, becauſe it would be <hi>her company</hi> they deſired, and the <hi>ſenſual</hi> gratification would be conſidered as a trifle. <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi> men will propagate their ſpecies; not becauſe a certain pleaſure is annexed to this action, but becauſe it is <hi>right</hi> the ſpecies ſhould be propagated, and the <hi>manner</hi> in which they exerciſe this function will be regulated by the dictates of reaſon and duty. It cannot definitively be affirmed, in ſuch a ſtate of ſociety, who is the father of the child; but it is of <hi>no conſequence.</hi> I ought to prefer <hi>no</hi> human being to another becauſe that being is my father, my wife, or my ſon<note n="*" place="bottom">Godwin's Political Juſtice, 410 page 852.</note>.'</p>
               <p>'What a glorious doctrine!' cried Alogos: 'one might then have as many concubines and children as they could procure. This very reaſon alone ought to make us deteſt monarchical govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where what is called ſacred engagements are obliged to be in ſome ſort preſerved. I will, this very day, tell the world that I diſregard its preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, and Suſan ſhall appear in her proper charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.'</p>
               <p>Poor Suſan, who was an ignorant, vulgar girl, was ſo intoxicated with the elevation from the cook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, that ſhe reſolved to exert the inborn Rights of Women, diſdaining any longer to ſuperintend

the kitchen; and the Doctor frequently curſed ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, which had introduced luxurious diſhes.</p>
               <p>Mean-while theſe two great men exerted their endeavours to reform the pariſhioners, and it was not long before the excellent effects of their doctrine became viſible. The churches, thoſe temples of prieſtcraft and ignorance, were ſoon left without vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors; and even the elocution of a popular preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er could not aſſemble an audience.</p>
               <p>The two philoſophers rejoiced at this dawn of reaſon, and, the better to <hi>ſpread</hi> the truth, erected a large barn into a Hall of Reaſon, where they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook alternately to read moral lectures.—Fred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erick there clearly proved, that all religion was the offspring of ignorance, reſulting from ideas, mingled with impreſſions, mingled with realities; and that the firſt idea of a Deity was taken from a howling wind on a ſtormy night; ſo that, if he did not convince, he confounded his hearers. He, however, proved beyond a doubt, that religion was not of the ſmalleſt benefit to mankind, 'It is true,' ſaid he, in one of his lectures, 'that <hi>architecture</hi> was firſt carried beyond the unpoliſhed beam, and the unſhapen ſtone, by the enthuſiaſm of people to honour an unknown Deity; but could any thing be more abſurd than to raiſe great piles of magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence to nobody knew who? And what was the conſequence? Why, the great men then would have great houſes, and no longer live, as they uſed to do, in hovels of mud. It is true that <hi>aſtronomy</hi> was firſt ſtudied for the ſake of tracing the power of God in the creation; but what has been the reſult? We have learnt to traverſe the ocean, and ſend people from Europe to tyrannize over the people of Africa. Religion indeed gave birth to all the <hi>arts and ſciences,</hi> becauſe it was ſuppoſed the Architect of worlds muſt delight in grandeur, and every coſtly

ornament was deemed too little an offering to his abode. But, in my opinion, this would better have been given to the ſtarving poor—no doubt the prieſts had their tithes out of it. (Here a loud burſt of applauſe broke forth.) It is in vain to ſay that monks have been the preſervers of <hi>literature;</hi> for, at the time they promoted it, they had no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to benefit mankind, and it is the intention which makes the merit. You are told that religion teaches ſocial duties; that it is wrong to injure your neighbour, for you ſhall be hereafter puniſhed. Who told you all this? A parcel of prieſts, whom you pay to hold you in darkneſs. Are you to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, or I who inſtruct you for nothing? I tell you then that there are no future rewards and puniſhments. I am certain no man can prove that there are; and if you read the great book of Nature, it does not ſay a word about it. That is the book you ought to ſtudy, and burn your Bibles, if you would enjoy the world without thoſe ſhocking re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections about fire and brimſtone.'</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Moral</hi> lectures like theſe could not but influence the minds of the country people, who wondered they had been ſo long impoſed upon. The Curate was under the neceſſity of ſuing for the tithes, and the parſonage was threatened with deſtruction.</p>
               <p>Corn had been dear and ſcarce, owing to a wet ſeaſon; and to render it cheap, a mob of patriots burnt down ſeveral ſtacks and barns, for which one was hanged and three tranſported.</p>
               <p>The Principles of Univerſal Equality, and The Catechiſm of Nature, the one written by Fred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erick, and the other by Doctor Alogos, were printed and diſtributed gratis. The public houſes had each <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

for, politics diſcuſſed, and ale conſumed with genuine liberty; by which means thoſe here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore ignorant people became <hi>warm advocates</hi> for freedom, and declaimed about the inborn reaſon of the human ſoul, till all reaſon was ſuſpended in hilarity, and the whole company <hi>levelled</hi> to a ſtate of <hi>ſwiniſh equality.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They now clearly perceived that the times were the worſt that ever Old England had witneſſed; for they every day found themſelves leſs able to maintain their families; and ſo far from being ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to pay their rents, they had ſcarcely money ſufficient to ſupport the club, on which depended the ſalvation of their country.</p>
               <p>In vain the gentlemen of the pariſh endeavoured to ſtay this torrent of philoſophy. Man only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to be told his rights to know them. The young men copying the example of Doctor Alogos, were not to be bubbled out of a fee by the prieſts, and the wives became what is vulgarly called lazy and ſlovenly, but which in the language of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined philoſophy, is independent, and ſuperior to prejudice.</p>
               <p>Things proceeded thus admirably in a pariſh, where, but a little time before, all had gone on in the old track, where contented and ignorant families depended on their own labour, and were ſo proud of the childiſh title of Engliſhmen, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted a work-houſe ſo long as health and ſtrength remained. But now they ſaw clearly, that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>Rights of Man,</hi> every one had a juſt demand for ſupport from the community, after a certain age, and therefore to work for a rainy day was as abſurd as it was old.</p>
               <p>The poor rates multiplied ſo faſt upon thoſe who ſtill continued to ſupport the Gothic prejudices of
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:038973_0125_101283C58FAE6B68"/>
their anceſtors, that ſeveral heretofore flouriſhing families were obliged to quit the pariſh, and their farms remained unoccupied.</p>
               <p>Frederick, in the mean time, had endeavoured to cultivate the affections of Laura; but though he gained upon her heart, her head reſiſted all the arguments of his philoſophy. It was in vain he traduced the cuſtom of marriage; ſhe remained wedded to the blind principles in which ſhe had been educated. 'For,' ſaid ſhe, 'were I to become your <hi>companion,</hi> or that of any other man, when I ſhall perhaps be ſurrounded with two or three chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, a moment's diſguſt may leave me without a partner. Till it is the faſhion for men to maintain the children of others, no woman in her ſenſes would permit the paſſion of a man unmarried, becauſe, though he could range and ſelect another, ſhe muſt remain forlorn and abandoned.'</p>
               <p>'The ſuppoſition,' ſaid Frederick, 'that I muſt have a companion for life, is the reſult of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of vices: It is the dictate of cowardice, and not of fortitude: It flows from a deſire of being loved and eſteemed for ſomething that is not deſert. The inſtitution of marriage is a <hi>ſyſtem of fraud,</hi> and men who <hi>carefully miſlead</hi> their judgments in the daily affairs of their life, will always have a crip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled judgment in every other concern.—Marriage is law, and the <hi>worſt of all laws.</hi> Whatever our underſtandings may tell us of the perſon from whoſe connexion we ſhould derive the greateſt improvement, of the worth of one woman, and the demerits of another, we are obliged to conſider what is law, and not what is juſtice. <hi>So long as I ſeek to engroſs one woman to myſelf, and prohibit my neighbour from proving his ſuperior deſerts, and reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>'Do you wiſh me,' ſaid Laura, 'to ſuppoſe you ſpeak ſeriouſly? You are dreaming, Frederick, or you are mad or worſe. To ſay nothing of the <hi>moral</hi> turpitude of ſuch infamous and <hi>brothel</hi> doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, I ſhould like to know if there is one ſingle republican in the kingdom, who, however he might wiſh to indulge <hi>himſelf</hi> in ſuch licenſe, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his mother, his wife, his ſiſter, or his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to live promiſcuouſly like beaſts of the field?'</p>
               <p>'And are men not by nature brutes, as the mighty Rouſſeau has proved to a demonſtration?'</p>
               <p>'Let us take it ſo,' ſaid Laura, with a ſigh: 'what will be the reſult? We ſhould ſee half a dozen throats cut for a pretty woman, for then the law would be no check on licentious appetites. But, Sir, reflect <hi>if</hi> what I ſay be not true.

You would caſt aſide reſtrains, becauſe you are too great ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants yourſelves to ſubmit to the government of others; as, for inſtance, Doctor Alogos was one of the beſt tempered, humane men in the world, till he took to theſe whims from the loſs of a law-ſuit; and now, though he is always telling us we are ſlaves, and have as much right as the men to every freedom, yet, if every article in the houſe, to the ſmalleſt trifle, is not in exact order, we hear noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but execrations, which once he was afraid to utter.

               <p>'I am very ſorry,' ſaid Frederick, 'that you argue as if you had never heard the great doctrines of philoſophy. Had you heard my Mary on this ſubject! perſuaſion hung upon her tongue, and the ſelf-demonſtrated axioms of moral ſcience flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from her lips. "It is difficult to recommend any thing to indiſcriminate adoption, contrary to the eſtabliſhed rules and prejudices of mankind; but certainly nothing can be ſo ridiculous upon the face of it, or ſo contrary to the <hi>genuine march</hi> of ſentiment, as to require the overflowing of the ſoul to wait upon a ceremony, and that which, wherev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er delicacy and imagination exiſt, is of all things moſt ſacredly private, to blow <hi>a trumpet</hi> before it, and to record the moment when it has arrived at its climax<note n="*" place="bottom">Memoirs of Mrs. Woolſtonecraft Godwin.

               <p>'Excellent!' cried Laura, breaking into a laugh; 'this is ſheer bombaſt, and putting into hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perbolic language what might have been ſaid in ſimple words. Can any thing be more <hi>impudent</hi> than for a woman to <hi>marry,</hi> becauſe by marrying ſhe tells the world that ſhe has conformed to its cuſtoms in following the purpoſe of her creation?

               <p>'There is no reaſoning with women,' cried Frederick, in a pet; 'they have no ſouls capable of receiving the new light of irradiating ſcience, which is breaking through the miſts of ſuperſtition and ignorance. How few are like my Mary, free in thought and in action! She was a wonderful wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and deſpiſed the jeſts of the world: ſhe knew, that in reality there was no difference of ſex in ſouls, but that education made women fools and idiots.'</p>
               <p>'You have often,' ſaid Laura,' talked to me in this ſtrain; you have told me that women are no otherwiſe inferior to men than by education; but to me there appears an humbling difference.— Have they not to bear and bring children into the world? Are they not then tied down to the routine of a nurſery? Are not all their employments neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily domeſtic? And does not nature ſeem to have pointed to this end in the diſpoſition of their frame? —Men, in all countries, take upon them the ruder employments, and it is only an eccentric ſoul that would wiſh, in the frenzy of imagination, to blend the ſexes.'</p>
               <p>'But women, with their preſent <hi>weakneſs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellect,</hi> are not capable of teaching children their duties, and rational philoſophy.'</p>
               <p>'I will quote you a paſſage,' ſaid Laura, 'from a droll book at reveries my uncle lately bought, called the Rights of Women.

               <p>From this quotation we may infer two conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: Firſt, that a perſon of <hi>genius</hi> poſſeſſes not the <hi>ſteady, ſober eye of reaſon,</hi> and therefore all your pretended philoſophers, reformers, and men of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found genius, have not one jot of reaſon, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently are <hi>fools.</hi> Secondly, allowing women to he pretty idiots, they are the moſt proper to give education, and the leſs genius they poſſeſs, the greater is their qualification: and indeed I might draw a third inference, that perſons writing pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable contradictions are unworthy notice on either ſide.'</p>
               <p>'Oh!' cried Frederick, 'were the great Stupeo here, he would bring arguments that would incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertibly prove—'</p>
               <p>'Prove what?' ſaid Laura: 'prove himſelf a greater fool than his pupil.'</p>
               <p>'No,' cried Frederick, 'prove that you are the charmingeſt pretty idiot in the world.'</p>
               <p>Thus the great copyiſt of one of the greateſt phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers that have glittered in the eighteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, deſcended from the pinnacle of intellect to tell a girl what her glaſs told her every morning. But, as Voltaire has admirably proved, by a few arguments in about a hundred different places, and Roſſeau demonſtrated by practice with the idiot Tereſa, it is a fact, that great heroes, great poets, great philoſophers, metaphyſicians, and ballad-mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, have all become fools to pleaſe fooliſh women.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XI. Reaſons for peopling the world—ſpecimen of the Sublime— the conſolations of Philoſophy in Diſappointment—the immutability of Truth.</head>
               <p>FREDERICK was diſcompoſed beyond the dignity of a philoſopher at the perverſeneſs of Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra: he began almoſt to think that women were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings made expreſsly for the pleaſures of men, a gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed toy, which a great metaphyſician and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher might condeſcend to play with when he quitted the Hall of Contemplation, and ventured from the paths of intellectual rambling to the groſs pavement of life.</p>
               <p>His mind was perpetually bent upon the great work of reformation, and the perfection of juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, <hi>except</hi> when he muſed upon the pretty lip of Laura, which frequently dimpled with an inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſmile, and that ſmile was not the vacant ſmile of childiſhneſs—it was a ſmile of meaning, expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive of ſome fine ſenſation of mind, brightening the whole countenance, and lightening the eye with the intelligence of good ſenſe.</p>
               <p>'I know not,' ſaid he to himſelf, as he rambled over the fields, 'what to make of this girl; ſhe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as if ſhe had reaſon, but it is quite in the old ſtyle. What is this love? What would my dear Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peo define it? A paſſion, that, like an optic glaſs, inverts its object. Ah! now I am ſatisfied ſhe does not in reality poſſeſs any good quality: it is my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which deceives me, and ſhe is no more an angel than the reſt of her ſex. All her virtues are only
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:038973_0131_101283D5B941CA88"/>
like colours in objects, merely rays preſſed in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent angles upon the eye. She herſelf is a blank, a mere white ſheet of paper, and it remains for me to ſtamp upon her any character I pleaſe. As to beauty—what is beauty? Aſk a negro of Guinea what is beauty, the ſupremely beautiful, the <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Having thus uſed the light of human reaſon in rational argument, Frederick determined that Laura muſt and ſhould be his, not for his own ſake, but for the promotion of freedom, and the <hi>ſpread of the truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'It is the univerſal good and greateſt reſulting benefit we are ever to have in view,' continued he: 'all the great men of the eighteenth century tell us we muſt not regard any contingencies, theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only partial and unavoidable evils. It is plain the world muſt be peopled; for if it is not peopled, we philoſophers would have nobody to revolutionize, and reaſon and logic, and ignorance, would be tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamount to the ſame. This then is the ſelf-demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated hypotheſis: this then is the grand baſis to build upon; and as all things depend upon peopling the world, it follows, that to people the world is the moſt meritorious action of life. But how am I to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to this greateſt good, if Laura perſiſts in her notions of matrimony? It is impoſſible. I ſhould then ſurrender my freedom, and freedom is even a <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> good <hi>than life</hi> itſelf. Some middle way muſt be deviſed; and though I abhor giving pain to any creature under the heavens, yet I muſt not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred from peopling the world, by the tears, faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:038973_0132_101283DA0F74D920"/>
and frettings of a woman who even does not know the great maxims of philoſophy. What are tears? mere bubbles of water emitted from a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſtimulus of the nerves of the eye: Women have weaker nerves than men, therefore tears from them are more common. As to fainting, that alſo depends on weak nerves:—Some will faint at the ſight of a rat. Well, I cannot help the irritability of the nervous ſyſtem:—A charming idea indeed! that, becauſe women have weak nerves, the world is not to be peopled! Beſides, am I not a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher? Yes: I have, and I will riſe far above hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature. Have I not ſeduced the miſtreſs of my friend? Have I not been the means of a pretty girl and her father periſhing in the flames? Have I not led a mob to burn down the metropolis of Great Britain? Have I not induced a wife to betray her huſband, which cauſed his own and his children's death? Have I not loſt three teeth and half my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle finger in the cauſe of liberty? Have I not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered my own mother? And ſhall the tears and lamentings of a girl prevent my marching forward in the high road of all-irradiating ſcience, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling the world?</p>
               <p>'O Philoſophy! how few can contemplate thy ſublime and terrific features: Thy feet ſtand upon the poles of the world—thy head is cinctured round with nubilated exhalations, whoſe volcanic entrails emit thunderings and lightenings that ſcatter all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence around thee, and hecatombs of infidels and ſurdous men are reared or diſperſed by the cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clyſms of thy ſcientific fulminations. When ſhall the catenas of mankind be decrepitated by the furnace of truth, ignited by the bellows of reaſon? When ſhall the ingannations of prejudice be delacerated, and the catachreſtical reaſonings of facinorous ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocrats
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:038973_0133_101283DBAB60D7D8"/>
be diſpanded by the zetetic ſpirit of the eighteenth century?'<note n="*" place="bottom">For the ſake of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> reader, theſe words may be found in Johnſon's Dictionary.</note>
               </p>
               <p>From this prodigious flight of the true ſublime and unintelligible, Frederick ſuddenly deſcended to the conſideration of more common action: ſimply, how he might promote the increaſe of mankind. It appeared no very eaſy taſk to do away the qualms of conſcience in a modeſt girl, unleſs indeed he could prove to her that there was no ſuch thing as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, which was a taſk of no great difficulty for a modern philoſopher to undertake. Another ſmall reflection occupied him, for he ſaw that he muſt proceed upon the principles of deception, and what then became of immutable truth? But on weighing over the maxims of <hi>political juſtice,</hi> he found that deception was extremely moral in affairs of love, and he was more than ever enamoured of the new philoſophy, which ſeemed calculated for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of man.</p>
               <p>He began with Doctor Alogos, whom he ſoon convinced of the non-entity of conſcience; that reaſon was the only guide to truth, and paſſion the index to pleaſure. Laura, the blind prejudiced Laura, was not to be wrought upon by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundneſs of his reaſonings and the ſubtilty of his logic.—'Though I feel myſelf unequal to anſwer you,' ſaid ſhe, 'that by no means is an approval of your arguments; for I well know that by argument we can neither prove nor refute many things which yet we feel to be or not to be. For inſtance, you may tell me I am ten feet or only ten inches high; that my ſight deceives me; and you may confound me with arguments to prove your aſſertion. But all thoſe arguments will not change my opinion that I am only five feet high, nor will you perſuade me that I have no conſcience.'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="unknown:038973_0134_101283DE88A8A8D8"/>One fine glowing evening, when the country was yellowed over with harveſt, and the birds chirped amongſt the hedges, which were hung with ſtalks of looſe corn, Frederick and Laura took a walk to ſome diſtance, and, as it is very natural, diſcourſed on love by the way.</p>
               <p>Frederick exerted all his eloquence upon the uſual ſubject; but ſeeing that he made no impreſſion, he <hi>tranſided</hi> into the more natural language of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-place, ſuch as has been the practice of all lovers ſince the flood, and ſuch as will continue to win the hearts of the fair, till philoſophy ſhall introduce a new ſet of ideas and ſenſations.—'I will,' ſaid he, 'char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Laura, adopt your ſide of the queſtion, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally metaphyſics do not altogether ſatisfy the heart.'</p>
               <p>'Were you to forſake your wild opinions,' ſaid Laura, 'you would become an agreeable member of ſociety.'</p>
               <p>'It is you,' he replied, 'who muſt make, me ſo; it is you I ſhall look up to for inſtruction; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the ſentiments of Rouſſeau in his Emilius. If woman be formed to pleaſe, and be ſubjected to man, it is her place doubtleſs to render herſelf agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him inſtead of challenging his paſſion: the violence of his deſires depends upon her charms; it is by means of theſe ſhe ſhould urge him to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of thoſe powers nature has given him. The moſt ſucceſsful method of exciting is to render ſuch exertion neceſſary by reſiſtance, as in that caſe ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>love is added to deſire, and the one triumphs in the victory which the other is obliged to acquire.'</p>
               <p>'Theſe ſentiments were worthy a voluptuary,' replied Laura: 'they came, no doubt, warm from the heart of Rouſſeau.'</p>
               <p>'Yes,' ſaid Frederick, 'from the author of Eloiſa we ſhould expect ſtrong expreſſions, but they are nevertheleſs true. You have read, Laura,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:038973_0135_101283E2CAB35D58"/>
that charming romance. What did you feel at the <hi>firſt kiſs of love?</hi> In a word, did not the whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance ſet your ſoul on fire?'</p>
               <p>'No,' replied Laura; 'I ſaw through the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtical jargon of rhapſodic language. I beheld only a man who kept a milliner, endeavouring to juſtify his actions to the world by drawing a fiery picture totally untrue. Do you think there is a man in the world like Wolmar? And what was St. Preux but a precious ſentimental raſcal, who, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſanction of the moſt ſacred friendſhip, plunders, a believing love-ſick girl, and talks all the while about virtue and celeſtial innocence?'</p>
               <p>Frederick found by this diſcourſe that he ſhould not eaſily contaminate the purity of her mind by the introduction of voluptuous ſubjects, for he knew of no book more likely to introduce a deſire of diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation than the celebrated Eloiſa of Rouſſeau:<note n="*" place="bottom">To this may now be added the Monk.</note> he therefore reſolved to ſupply his want of perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by violence, beginning with thoſe liberties of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten allowed, till his paſſions throwing him off his guard, he exerted that proweſs which men are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with for other purpoſes; but here he was again deceived, Laura not being one of thoſe puny ſlips of faſhion which ſhrink from the touch.</p>
               <p>The philoſopher was confounded at a reſiſtance he had not expected from the delicate figure of the maid. He hung down his head in ſilent <hi>vexation</hi> at her keen reproaches; for <hi>ſhame</hi> he knew not, unleſs it was in ſtopping ſhort of his heroic and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotic intentions. He propoſed, in a tone of voice much beneath the dignity of manhood to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her home, but ſhe refuſed his offer with ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlative diſdain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="125" facs="unknown:038973_0136_101283E5AD816230"/>He turned away to philoſophiſe, and call to his aid the doctrines of Stupeo: ſo chagrined was he at the diſappointment, that he almoſt reſolved never again to preſent himſelf before Doctor Alogos— but again he reflected, that it was unworthy a great man to ſtoop to accidents, it being more in the order of Nature that accidents ſhould bend to them.</p>
               <p>As he walked forward, wrapped in <hi>muſing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy,</hi> a gleam of ſatisfaction darted acroſs his mind—'Why' ſaid he, internally, 'am I ſo griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a trifling diſappointment:—I, who am a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing independent of the Univerſe, in how few years will age deſtroy the appetite for pleaſure, and I ſhall then regret not having made more advantage of the fleeting moments. Did I bow down to the idols of prieſtcraft, I might be deterred from many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions called <hi>crimes,</hi> by the dread of future puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but it is the height of monkiſh blindneſs to ſuppoſe there is any ſuch thing as future puniſhment, and I am perſuaded, I am certain, half mankind do not give credit to ſuch ſhocking doctrines, or it would be impoſſible they could act as they do.— What lawyer would undertake a wrong cauſe? What guardian would ruin the orphan under his care? What wife would betray her huſband? What ſon would diſobey his father? What father would ruin his family with variety of exceſs? And what young man would, for the pleaſure of half an hour, cajole, with falſe oaths and profeſſions, a fair, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving-tender-hearted girl into a miſery that can end only with her life?—No; I am certain, if peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple believed any thing of revealed religion, none of this could happen. Then ſhall I be trammelled by ſuch conſiderations? O Philoſophy! divine light of the ſoul I thy conſolations never fail in the hour of
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:038973_0137_101283E74A7206C8"/>
diſtreſs. Beware, ſays St. Paul, leſt men ſpoil you through philoſophy and vain deceit; but Paul was an old woman, Paul knew nothing of <hi>eternal ſteep.</hi>'</p>
               <p>Having thus confirmed his mind in theſe delecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble principles, he felt re-aſſured to his purpoſe, and inclined his thoughts to ſuggeſt the means of ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Laura.</p>
               <p>Laura informed her uncle of the great deſigns of the vagabond Philoſopher; but that diſciple of the new ſchool only cooly bid her be cautious, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in nature could be more natural.</p>
               <p>Frederick was ſurpriſed to find the Doctor in good ſpirits; and no hint being dropped concerning his recent attempt, he already concluded Laura in his poſſeſſion. He retired early to bed to digeſt his plan; and not being, able to ſleep, he tumbled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout till midnight, when he was alarmed with a grating noiſe at the window beneath him. He liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, and fancying he heard footſteps, aroſe, and was proceeding down ſtairs with a poker in his hand, when two men aſcending, preſented piſtols at him, with threats of inſtant death, if he alarmed the houſe.</p>
               <p>'Am I to be deterred from ſpeaking the truth?' ſaid Frederick: 'a truly virtuous man will proclaim the truth, amidſt an hoſt of foes.'</p>
               <p>'D—n my glims,' ſaid one of the ruffians, 'you are a rum quiz; but I ſuppoſe he is dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.'</p>

                  </gap> where the old codger hides his caſh.'</p>
               <p>'Truth,' replied Frederick, 'is invariable: the great Stupeo declared that no circumſtance could change its effects, and that it muſt be ſpoken at all times.'</p>
               <p>'Well, out with it then, and no qualms.'</p>
               <p>'In love,' continued Frederick, with <hi>ſang froid,</hi>
                  <pb n="127" facs="unknown:038973_0138_101283EA380FD650"/>
'we may conceal the truth becauſe it is an allowa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deception to deceive a girl to her own benefit, and the augmentation of mankind. But, for the ſake of wealth, droſs, traſh, rubbiſh—'</p>
               <p>'D—e' cried the firſt, 'you are a deviliſh rum one: only tell us where we may find the rubbiſh, and leſs of the gab.'</p>
               <p>'This rabbiſh,' cried Frederick, 'the bane of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, the cauſe of all unnatural accumulations, of all the miſeries of ſuffering man; what is this to truth, eternal and immutable truth?'</p>
               <p>'Blow his brains out,' ſaid the robber, 'if he don't inſtantly tell us where the poſſibles be.'</p>
               <p>'We are not to be compelled to ſpeak truth,' ſaid Frederick: 'we ſhould ſpeak it for its own ſake, and not to avoid any evil, or to promote any independent good: for inſtance, I could now, to avoid the evil you threaten, tell you that in the front parlour there are bank notes to the amount of fifty pounds, and that would ſatisfy you; but that is an equivocation, becauſe you aſk where <hi>the money</hi> is concealed, implying <hi>all.</hi> (Aye! aye! All! all!) Well, that being the caſe, and an equivocation being a lie, according to Dr. Paley, I continue to tell you, that under his bed in the back room, on the ſecond floor, is an iron cheſt, where you will find the remainder, and thus it is clearly demonſtrated that—'</p>
               <p>'Aye, aye, clear enough,' cried the thieves, 'don't ſay a word more—go back to your own bed and ſleep in a ſound ſkin.'</p>
               <p>I am not obliged, ſaid Frederick to himſelf, to run hazards in proclaiming truth when it is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. Perhaps theſe patriots intend to murder the old Doctor: well, ſuppoſe they do, what will be the reſulting conſequences? Ignorant, unillum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:038973_0139_101283EE345F64F8"/>
people, in ſtating this fine and metaphyſical argument, would talk about gratitude—that is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally exploded in political juſtice. A ſervant might urge his being obliged to ſerve his maſter, but I am no ſervant; and a ſervant would be condemned if he did not aſſiſt to deſtroy his maſter in the cauſe of truth, by the new ſyſtem. But what poſſible good will reſult to mankind by the death of the Doctor? Is he not one of us? Is he not an enlightened phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher of the eighteenth century? He has already created three or four riots in the pariſh, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the people ſo diſſatisfied, that they will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther work nor play. A revolution ſeems maturing in this little ſpot, that ſhall light the torch of liberty all over Europe: and ſhall this man be cut off by men who ſeem unorganized to ſyſtematic depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—men who do not ſeem to plunder upon princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? No; the whole human race would ſuffer in his loſs.</p>
               <p>Theſe arguments were convincing, and he haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with the poker in his hand to the chamber.— The robbers had drawn out the cheſt, and emptied its contents, when Doctor Alogos awaking, began to call aloud for aſſiſtance, and the robbers ſwore they would cut his throat if he was not ſilent. At that inſtant Frederick burſt into the room, and one of the thieves fired, but miſſed him. A blow of the poker tore off the raſcals car, and ſhook his arm ſo rudely, that the piſtol fell to the floor, and the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor having reached a blunderbuſs, they hurried a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, carrying with them the notes and caſh with which they filled their pockets, ſwearing they would ſhoot whoever attempted to follow them.</p>
               <p>'My dear Frederick,' cried the Doctor, embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, 'you are a brave fellow, and this ſavour ſhall not go unrewarded: you may always rely on my friendſhip.'</p>
               <p>'Friendſhip!' exclaimed Frederick. 'Has
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:038973_0140_101283EFD0A9EE20"/>
fear clouded your intellects? Friendſhip is well enough for boarding-ſchool girls, who are plotting intrigues. You muſt eſteem me for my intrinſic value, and not becauſe I have done <hi>you</hi> a ſervice. No man ought to return favour for favour—that is an old obſolete doctrine, done away entirely by the new political juſtice. Hear the great ſentiments of the great Stupeo on favours:—'It may be objected,' ſaid he, 'that a mutual commerce of benefits tends to increaſe the maſs (or cube lump) of benevolent action, and that to increaſe the <hi>maſs</hi> of benevolent action is to contribute to the general good: indeed, is the general good promoted by felſehood, by treating a man of <hi>one degree</hi> of worth, as if he had <hi>ten times</hi> that worth? or, as if he were in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree different from what he really is? Would not the moſt beneficial conſequences reſult from a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent plan, from my conſtantly and carefully inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the deſerts of <hi>all</hi> thoſe with whom I am connected, and from their being <hi>ſure,</hi> after a <hi>certain allowance</hi> for the infallibility of human judgment, of being treated by me exactly as they deſerved? Who can tell the effects of ſuch a plan univerſally adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?'<note n="*" place="bottom">Godwin's Political Juſtice, page 36.</note>
               </p>
               <p>'Not even the profound Stupeo himſelf, 'ſaid Doctor Alogos. 'I very much fear we ſhall never arrive at that perfection of knowledge, ſo as to be <hi>ſure</hi> and yet <hi>uncertain</hi> of the quantity of merit: had that great man lived, he would, no doubt, have made a barometer, which, upon being applied to the object, would inſtantly ſettle to the exact degree of worth.'</p>
               <p>'The idea is original,' cried Frederick, 'and I am perſuaded he would have attempted its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion, for mind in that caſe would overcome mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

Alas! what has the world loſt by the death of ſuch a man, who only was reſcued from the gallows to be ſhot in a riot. O Fortune! what a jilt art thou to men of genius and ſcience.'</p>
               <p>'Nothing more true,' ſaid the Doctor, with a ſigh. 'Here is an end of our great projects of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, for my rents come in very ſlowly, the wretches declaring they have a right to the ground rent free, and here I have loſt five hundred pounds.'</p>
               <p>'It is the vile government we live under,' ſaid Frederick; 'a monarchy is a mere excreſcence, and a diſeaſe in the body of ſociety: the wars it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and the laviſh revenues by which it is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, make it unbearable. Ah! if we could fly from its evils and re-aſſume the primitive ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of mankind; if we could ſhake off all ſorts of governments, and live to ourſelves as independent and rational beings, we ſhould then pay no taxes: Laura ſhould be my companion, and Suſan yours: —there beneath vine trees of our own planting, we ſhould ſit and talk of love: beneath the date tree and the olive we ſhould ſing hymns of peace, and in the ſylvan ſhades ſhould we be united in har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and celeſtial affections. Our children would promiſcuouſly grow up untainted by the world, and no tyrant ſhould violate the chaſtity of our daughters at his imperious will.'</p>
               <p>'Oh! charming,' cried the Doctor, dreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. 'Go and wake Laura inſtantly, and before to-morrow's ſun raiſes the blue miſts of the lake, we will be on our journey to this terreſtial para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe.</p>
               <p>Frederick, impreſſed with equal rapture at the romantic idea, and repeating to himſelf anathemas againſt the tyrants who have debaſed unthinking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, he haſtened to the chamber of Laura.—
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:038973_0142_101283F45B2DDAF0"/>
He found her half dreſſed, having been alarmed at the cries of her uncle. She bluſhed at being thus expoſed to the eyes of ſo great a philoſopher, and that bluſh drove all the tyrants from the mind of Frederick. He claſped the fair maid in his arms, and at that moment Doctor Alogos entered to tell his niece the ſervice he had received from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of the virtuous hero.</p>
               <p>Frederick, in ſuch a ſituation, would have been confuſed if he had not been a very great man: but he was arrived at ſo much perfection, that he could liſten to his own praiſe in the moment he wiſhed to perpetrate what with half mankind would have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him an object of deteſtation; but this attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could only be acquired by a ſteady attention to all the enlightened doctrines of the eighteenth century, and is called the bold, unbluſhing front of manly truth.</p>
               <p>Laura rejoiced at the eſcape of her uncle, for her boſom was only too ſuſceptible of gratitude, and ſhe almoſt forgave the attack upon herſelf. She, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, objected to the plan of emigration, as a wild-gooſe chaſe after happineſs; and the arguments ſhe uſed almoſt convinced the Doctor that all pleaſure was ideal, for, as to dates and olives, not a ſingle tree grows in all North America, which obliged Frederick to own he meant only <hi>figurative</hi> expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Frederick was too candid to conceal his diſcourſe with the robbers, and Doctor Alogos could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain obſerving, that, though truth ought to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken at all times, yet, if it coſt five hundred pounds, it was as well to be ſilent.</p>

               <p>THE harmony of the family once more reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the public good became again their chief care, but an accident happened that very much checked their proceedings. A countryman had been detect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed offering one of the notes which had been ſtolen, and was carried before a Juſtice of the Peace, where he was identified by Frederick and the Doctor.— He pleaded very much in his own favour, proteſting that it was his firſt crime, and that his accomplice had carried away the whole booty except that ſingle note.</p>
               <p>'And how,' ſaid the Juſtice, 'could you be guilty of ſo great an offence when you could not be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the law?'</p>
               <p>'That be very true, your honour,' replied the man: 'but I did hear Doctor Alogos in his pulpit reading a great book of political juſtice, which did ſay as how no law ought to puniſh <hi>offenders</hi> for a crime that be done, becauſe as that it were not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, pleaſe your worſhip, that any man ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ſame again, and no man ever committed the ſame offence in all its ſarcumſtances, as the law do mention. So, your honour, I thought that I did ſee clear enough, that if I did not do the action as the law did forbid, I were not guilty. Beſide, and more your honour, I were near ſtarving, having loſt my

playſe becauſe I would not attend church on a Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, nor work like a neger, as the Doctor did tell us we all were, as laboured for the rich; and ſo, your honour, I had nothing to do but to ſtarve, and the day were once, when I would have ſtarved rather than do a diſhoneſt act: but Doctor Alogos did tell us that there were no ſuch thing as diſhoneſty; that it were all a tale to cheat us out of our right; and that the poor ought to have the lands of the rich divided: ſo, playſe your honour, I were in a ſtrange quandary, and though my heart did miſgive me, I were perſuaded to begin with the Doctor, as it were but proper he ſhould practiſe what he did preach.'</p>
               <p>'Doctrines like theſe,' ſaid the Juſtice, 'are certainly of the moſt pernicious tendency, and, in fact, Doctor Alogos, this man appears to me leſs guilty than yourſelf.

               <p>'Such,' cried Frederick, 'is the bleſſed effects of property! The great philoſopher Stupeo, uſed to ſay, that the fruitful ſource of crimes conſiſts in one man's poſſeſſing in abundance that of which another man is deſtitute.

Drunkenneſs and luſt are their great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives to outrage, and <hi>not</hi> the want of food and raiment, the latter being, with a very ſmall excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the power of every one who is willing and who has ſtrength to work. It is likewiſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that, in the profeſſed ſyſtem of equality and property, no man is to enjoy or poſſeſs more than food and raiment, all elſe being luxury. It has been urged, that ſome have been ſtarved to death for want of encouragement, <hi>who had genius</hi> and tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; but let this be remembered, that it was ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their employing thoſe talents in a wrong way. Chatterton, for inſtance, ſtarved as an author, but he might have maintained himſelf well as a ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter; but, you will ſay, can any man of feeling ſpeak ſo coldly of ſo great a genius? We will not talk of feeling, but reaſon. When I ſpeak of Chatterton, I mean it of <hi>all others.</hi> Chatterton knew his abilities, and he wiſhed to force the world to acknowledge him at once—but this muſt always be a work of time. Placing his whole dependence on <hi>one</hi> foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, he was too proud to ſtoop from the high throne of poetic exaltation; whereas, had he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſchool-maſter, he might have lived and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the progreſs of his productions to the climax which awaited them. Again I would ſeriouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and would to heaven I could be heard by all mankind; this man here accuſed of robbery tells you one means of loſing his place was, diſregard of Sundays—mark with your own eyes the difference of thoſe who do attend the ſervice of God, and thoſe who do not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—I will not mention ſects of religion; but look at thoſe who pay a reverence to holy things.

ſobriety directs their way; they have no taſte for profligacy, and they rarely ſink into ruin from their own vices. But let us ſee thoſe men who deſpiſe the formality of church, and ſpend the Sunday in drinking and gaming; idleneſs and debauchery powerfully ſeize on the mind in theſe vacant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and thus it is from the cottage to the manſion that we may in general draw a man's moral char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter from his attention to Sunday; and we need none of us look far round, without, as it were, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that even in the tranſient proſperity of this world, God has diſtinguiſhed thoſe who obey his commandments.'</p>

               <p>'It is I,' cried the great philoſopher himſelf: 'I have eſcaped theſe evils by accident, but I have loſt my eye in the cauſe of freedom. How, my dear Frederick, are you here? How could you poſſibly eſcape the vengeance of that glorious night?'</p>
               <p>'Another time,' anſwered Frederick, 'I will tell you every thing; but, why are you deprived

               <p>'This is a mere trifle,' ſaid Stupeo: 'I am ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of marrying <hi>three</hi> wives, and as it is not a criminal proceſs, I ſhall eſcape with finding bail to maintain them.

               <p>'But is it poſſible,' cried Doctor Alogos, 'that you, Sir, the great and powerful opponent of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimony, ſhould be married to <hi>three</hi> at once? This ſtrikes me as a contradiction."</p>

In like manner, a man who has three or more wives may live as free as though unmarried, for he has only to go to the altar with any female whom he judges capable of adding to the ſtock of general, or reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good.'</p>
               <p>Frederick was ſtruck with this profound argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the company being now ordered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Juſtice, he pauſed to reflect whether, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all means were tried of ſubduing Laura, he might not adopt this plan without infringing the principles of liberty.</p>

               <p>Laura ſtarted with ſurpriſe at the ſight of ſo ſhocking a being in human form, and not being able to diſcern the wonderous patriot beneath his unſeemly habit (for females are ſtrangely impreſſed by exteriors,) ſhe concluded it one of the robbers of her uncle, and ſcarcely knew whether to run away or ſtay.</p>
               <p>The name of Stupeo which ſhe had often heard, arreſted her attention, and when ſhe gazed more minutely on the maſter, ſhe ceaſed to wonder at the eccentricities of the ſcholar.</p>
               <p>When they were ſeated and refreſhed, the Doctor enquired in what ſtate Stupeo had found the people of England in his excurſion?—'In what ſtate!' cried he, 'why, abſolutely ſtarving and undone: the whole country is in a rapid conſumption, and no efforts of man can ſave it. I may ſay, without vanity, I have done my endeavours. I have had twelve illegitimate children, but not one of them could bear the air of this foggy climate.

and a bank of violets, except in the perception of our ideas.</p>
               <p>The ſurgeon frequently lamented the neceſſity there was for this barbarous practice, as he called it. —'Were we allowed,' ſaid he, 'all unclaimed bodies which die in hoſpitals, all malefactors, of every deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription, and all ſuicides, we ſhould not need to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb the repoſe of ſacred bodies, whoſe place af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection laments and viſits, when perhaps they have been mangled to pieces in our lecture-room, or ſold piecemeal, at fixed prices, like butchers' meat, to any perſon.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is a known fact, that every part of the human body has a regular price. No perſon can deny the neceſſity of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſections, but as at preſent conducted, they are a diſgrace and an outrage on ſociety;—nor are the jeſts and levity of ſome of the young ſurgeons becoming, over the body of an human being.</note> The diſſection of ſuicides would be a greater preventive to the action than all the laws of <hi>felo de ſe,</hi> becauſe the plea of inſanity would not abrogate the conſequence.'</p>
               <p>My practice of plundering the church-yards at the moſt ſolemn hours, under danger of detection, and what was worſe, under the fear of infection from diſeaſes nearly advanced to putreſcence before the interment; to break open a coffin, and carry in my arms a naked body, whoſe ſcent was ſufficient to ferment a plague, was an undertaking that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired all the reſolution of philoſophy, and fitted me for the event of any revolution or combuſtion of nature.</p>
               <p>One day I obſerved to Dr. Cuticle, that it was to me a plain demonſtration from the ſtructure of the animal oeconomy, and its tendency to putreſcence, that it was like every other material ſubſtance; that the derangement of any one part affecting an imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, impalpable ſomething, called the ſoul, was a g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

could not be affected by matter—it could not feel pain in diſeaſe.—He replied,</p>
               <p>'Place a man in perfect health in a circular room, glazed round, ſome of the windows ſhall be green, ſome red, and ſome blue: you will grant that in looking through theſe windows he will ſee ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of different colours and ſhades, but yet his own ſight ſhall be clear and perfect. If the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows are dirty, he will ſee objects obſcure; and if they are painted black, the ſurrounding ſcenes will to him be inviſible; ſo the human ſoul, placed in the body, like the man in the room, can receive no external impreſſion but through that body. His reaſonings will take various ſhades, his paſſions and affections will be variouſly combined; but this does not deduce from his perfection as a man, but proves that the ſoul may be immortal, and yet <hi>obliged</hi> to partake of every accident which touches or acts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its habitation.'</p>
               <p>To this I replied—'Modern philoſophers define the ſoul to be an immaterial ſubſtance, in the ſtrict uſe of the term, ſignifying a <hi>ſubſtance</hi> that has <hi>no extenſion</hi> of any kind, nor any thing of the <hi>vis inertia</hi> that belongs to matter: it has neither <hi>length, breadth,</hi> nor <hi>thickneſs,</hi> ſo that it occupies no <hi>portion</hi> of ſpace; on which account the moſt rigorous metaphyſicians ſay, that it bears no ſort of relation to ſpace any more than <hi>ſound</hi> does to the <hi>eye,</hi> or <hi>light</hi> to the <hi>ear</hi>: in fact, that <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>ſpace</hi> have nothing to do with one another, and it is even improper to ſay an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material being exiſts in ſpace, or that it reſides in one place more than another, for, properly ſpeaking, it is <hi>no where,</hi> but has a mode of exiſtence that cannot be expreſſed by phraſeology appropriated to the modes in which matter exiſts<note n="*" place="bottom">Prieſtly on Matter and Spirit, vol. i. page 74.</note>.'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="unknown:038973_0155_1012841BB156BCC0"/>Cuticle bowed profoundly at this obſervation— 'You have proved to a demonſtration <hi>in words,</hi>' ſaid he, 'that we have no ſoul: to anſwer you <hi>in words</hi> would be an eaſy matter. I muſt confeſs that modern philoſophy has ſomething in it ſublimely unintelligible: it is like the definition you have given, a <hi>ſubſtance without ſubſtance,</hi> a cube, long, broad, and wide, but occupying <hi>no place,</hi> and has no more relation to reaſon and ſenſe, than <hi>nothing</hi> has to <hi>ſomething,</hi> and <hi>ſomething</hi> to <hi>nothing.</hi>—It is even improper to ſay philoſophy exiſts <hi>any where,</hi> or that it is <hi>here</hi> more than <hi>there,</hi> for, properly ſpeaking, it is <hi>no ſuch thing:</hi> its mode of exiſtence cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in any language utterable by the human tongue. Such an argument as this may be applied to any thing, and would diſprove the exiſtence of the whole univerſe.'</p>
               <p>So ſaying, he turned away to purſue ſome ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomical preparation, and I ſaw clear enough that we have no ſouls at all. My preſent employ was not congenial to my deſire of benefiting mankind. I was like a gem hid in the mud, and I reſolved to quit my ſituation. Indeed, the houſe-maid had been a little troubleſome, for in teaching her ſome of Munro's anatomical compariſons, we were natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly led from theory to practice, for ſhe had ſo much of the modern ſpirit of inquiry, that ſhe frequently attended diſſections promiſcuouſly with the other ſex<note n="*" place="bottom">One of the purſuits pointed out to females; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE following day, Frederick, in the garden, informed his tutor with his paſſion for Laura; that he debated with himſelf as to the reſulting good, and found a ſort of heſitation to uſe her with too much violence.</p>
               <p>'I will let you into a myſtery,' ſaid Stupeo. 'The great maſs of mankind are fools, and no better than the callous ſod on which we tread. It is the part of the great men and philoſophers to mould them as they pleaſe; and when we have ſhaken off the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of every thing called principle, are ſatisfied we have no portion in eternity, and that the fable of an avenging Deity is an old woman's tale, what

power, I aſk, can controul us? We become almoſt too great for the world; mind ſeems to riſe ſuperior to matter; crime becomes nothing; all that men call murder, inceſt, luſt, and cruelty, is trifling, not more, in fact, than changing the form of paſſive matter, or cutting down the trees of the foreſt: for, remember, we cannot <hi>deſtroy</hi> any thing, we only change its form; and ſuppoſe a woman dies under our hands, her death makes room for another; the ſame as plucking a turnip makes room for the plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a cabbage.'</p>
               <p>'I feel,' cried Frederick, 'I feel I am now free. —I ſhall render my name immortal, for no human tie—no moral check ſhall ſtay the purpoſe of my power. But it ſeems true, after all, that a ſociety of atheiſts could not exiſt, they would murder and be murdered: no truſt could be placed upon any man; the king would aſſaſſinate the man who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted him; the courtier would aſſaſſinate the man who oppoſed him; the wife would aſſaſſinate her huſband, when diſappointed in meeting her lover; no girl would arrive at the age of maturity; and the human ſpecies would ſoon become extinct.'</p>
               <p>'And what then?' ſaid Stupeo. 'The ſame ſpirit which now actuates our bodies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> muſt then actuate ſomething elſe:—you cannot annihilate that ſubtle gas; and if it does not give motion to men, it may to ſome new ſpecies:—who knows but it may animate the trees and plants with rational facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties<note n="*" place="bottom">Let the reader reflect upon this. Nothing is annihilated, though the form may be changed. What then becomes of the ſoul?—Are the laws of nature ſuſpended in this one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance? If not, the ſoul muſt ſtill exiſt—it muſt be ſomewhere.</note>—it would make this world a very different place.'</p>
               <p>'I ſhould like to ſee it,' ſaid Frederick. 'Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſics are ſurely the moſt uſeful of the ſciences;

but here comes Laura and the Doctor. We have been diſcourſing,' continued he, 'on matter and ſpirit, and it appears plain that matter is eternal, and ſpirit mere fermentation.'</p>
               <p>'I wonder,' ſaid the Doctor, 'how our world was ſo admirably formed, unleſs it was by the power of an omnipotent Being.'</p>
               <p>'Our earth,' cried Stupeo, 'was once a part of the ſun, a molten maſs, when a large comet bruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too near that luminary, daſhed off a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble portion, which flew till the natural motion form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it into a ſpheroid, and it began to cool. The at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere round it formed the ocean, and the fric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this vaſt body of waters upon the ſcoria and cinders, which compoſed the great ſkeleton of the world, formed the ſands of the ſea, which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided into large beds, riſing by degrees to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, where the action of the ſun hardened the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfices. The heat of this luminary upon the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid particles of the ſea generated ſhell-fiſh, which are evidently moſt allied to ſtone of any animal we know. Theſe poſſeſſed the whole of the ocean for ſome thouſand ages, and being by the gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the earth, thrown into large chains of beds, in the progreſs of time decaying and cementing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the olaginous-ſubſtance they contained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſhells became ſtones, forming mountains.— Thus we always find ſhells in every body of rock, and on the higheſt mountains. Every great change produced a revolution, and from the ſoft <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lime of ſhelly mountains, vegetables were produced.—This new form of matter decaying and fermenting, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, ſuch as lyons, tygers, bulls and monkeys, were produced. The latter was man in his original ſtate. It was ſome thouſand years before he learnt to walk upon his hind legs, ſome thouſand more before he pull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off his ſhaggy coating; but it is not material for me to trace him in every improvement, till he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:038973_0159_101284275012CEA0"/>
a full face from the effects of a change of cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and learnt the articulation of ſounds by imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the babbling of a brook, for he is to this day a creature imitating every other animal, and nothing is more clear than that he was originally an Ouran-outang.'</p>
               <p>'It ſtrikes me,' ſaid Laura, 'that your ſyſtem is a little prepoſterous; and one is led to inquire where you ſtood when the earth was a liquid ſtream of melting fire? But, with regard to man, I would obſerve, that had he <hi>ever</hi> been a mere brute ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, he <hi>never</hi> would have changed his nature; he never could have acquired perfectability, for we never ſee the leaſt progreſſion in animals, nor are monkeys, at this period, one ſingle degree advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond what they were three thouſand years ago; but, nevertheleſs,' ſaid ſhe, with a look of irony, 'when one ſees ſome people, they are apt to acknowledge the relationſhip, and when they hear the chatter of jingling, unmeaning ſentences, they are apt to cry out, that the Ouran-outang is the better man.'</p>
               <p>Stupeo could not but feel this ſally, but it was beneath his philoſophical metaphyſical dignity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, or even reply to this reaſoning of a woman, who was not illuminated with the ſplendid rays of intellect.</p>
               <p>Frederick often ſought an opportunity to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his ſchemes, but ſought in vain, the vigilance of Laura precluding a poſſibility of ſucceſs. He more than once attempted to infuſe a drug into her drink; but whether ſhe ſuſpected him or no, ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways avoided any thing from his hands which would admit adulteration.</p>
               <p>Peace was about this time eſtabliſhed with Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica, and the whole country rang with exultation. —During the war, no one had more execrated the ſyſtem than the Doctor, and every lecture conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:038973_0160_1012842FFB086958"/>
with an apoſtrophe to peace. He now mounted the pulpit in the Hall of Science, (the name of the lecture barn) and to prove that he was a very great philoſopher could find fault with every thing, and was ſtaunch at all times and all ſeaſons againſt gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. He declared that the peace was the moſt diſgraceful that could poſſibly be made; that it would not continue a twelvemonth before we ſhould be driven from Canada. He declared, that, like Milton's devils, mankind were only born for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion and revolution, that all their joy was to riot in deſtruction, murder, and violation.</p>
               <p>A number of ſoldiers who were returning to their families, hearing theſe great truths, ſwore the Doctor was inſulting them. A ſailor, with one leg, threw a crab cudgel at the head of the Doctor, which narrowly eſcaped him. Frederick leaped upon a bench, vociferating, 'Citizens! the cauſe of all mankind is involved in this diſpute: we ought to know whether theſe vagabonds are to inſult us in our halls, and in our temples. Truth is ſacred, and I will ſpeak it, though a legion of ſpies were around me.'</p>
               <p>'Citizens!' roared out Stupeo, 'you are under military government; the Philiſtines are upon us; the freedom of ſpeech has departed, and you are all ſlaves bound in chains, and riveted by your own ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineneſs.'</p>
               <p>Anarchy and confuſion now reigned in the Hall. The benches were broken in pieces and ſerved for clubs. A deſperate battle enſued, as ſome few of the country people ſtood by the Doctor; but they were ſoon completely drubbed, and fled in different routes. Doctor Alogos and his two companions found a temporary ſhelter in the manſion, and to their aſtoniſhment, ſaw their principal hearers the moſt violent.</p>
               <p>

               <p>'Reverence the divine majeſty of a mob,' cried Stupeo; 'all their motions poſſeſs energy, and all their actions juſtice. This is a mere momentary fermentation, the efferveſcence of popular frenzy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and will ſubſide into a delightful calm.'</p>
               <p>'But what are we to do in the mean time? We ſhall be murdered!'</p>
               <p>'A mere trifle, my dear Doctor:—a mere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modification of matter.'</p>
               <p>'A remodification of the devil: I don't at all like this.'</p>
               <p>'It is a d—d ariſtocratical church-and-king mob,' cried Frederick. 'I have been to talk to them, but they are deaf to the voice of reaſon; they are increaſed by a number of market-women, who vow vengeance againſt Stupeo for his three wives, and the Doctor for his kept miſtreſs. This is no repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican mob, inſpired with the divine frenzy of liberty and equality.'</p>
               <p>'Oh! curſe it,' cried Doctor Alogos, 'they ſeem to have liberty enough; they are treading down my fine flower-garden like an herd of ſwine; there go all my exotic ſhrubs!—I believe they are a troop of Goths and Vandals, who pay no regard to ſcience.'</p>
               <p>'There is your whole congregation!' cried Laura, weeping. 'My dear uncle, they are all gone mad; they are talking about rights and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, and deſtroying every thing before them.'</p>
               <p>'Let us defend ourſelves,' cried Frederick, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the front window. 'Citizens!' cried he, 'is it thus you abuſe your friends?'</p>

and down with the Doctor!' Frederick immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fired a fowling-piece, loaded with ſmall ſhot. A volley of ſtones was returned, which broke half the windows in front, and daſhed out one of the orator's teeth. Stupeo inſtantly advanced, with a blunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſs, which he fired, and checked the fury of the mob for an inſtant; but the ſoldiers leading the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack ſwore they would murder man, woman and child, and burn the houſe to the ground.</p>
               <p>Not a moment was to be loſt in this caſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme neceſſity; and Frederick even debated whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the reſulting good did not require him to join the mob, and aid them in the deſtruction of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. All the Doctor's cabinet of natural hiſtory was deſtroyed; his fine library made a bon-fire, and his elegant manſion was reduced to aſhes, amidſt the ſhouts of liberty and equality.</p>
               <p>The fugitives found ſhelter in the houſe of a neighbouring gentleman, who ſaved them from the madneſs of the mob. 'For me,' cried Frederick, 'I am determined not to remain another week in this vile iſland, where there is not one ſingle ſpark of liberty and national ſpirit remaining.'</p>
               <p>'What do you call this?' demanded the Doctor: 'I think it is liberty ſufficient to burn a man's houſe about his ears.'</p>
               <p>'But that muſt have been a mob hired by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,' ſaid Stupeo: 'had it been a republican mob, it would have been a different thing; we ſhould then have had a fine diſplay of rational prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.'</p>
               <p>'All mobs,' ſaid the gentleman, 'are alike, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever name you may give them. Miſchief is their only deſire—plunder the only object. To their lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers they are a ſubject of perpetual dread. For my part, I would rather live under a Turkiſh Baſhaw,

or in a country under martial law, than in a revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutionary country governed by mobs.'</p>
               <p>'For this reaſon,' ſaid Stupeo, 'you are a man of <hi>property,</hi> but for a man without any property, the latter is preferable, as it renders, in a ſummary way, the accumulations of wealth.'</p>
               <p>'But then,' anſwered the gentleman, 'you are not one moment ſure of your plunder; a ſtronger man may tear it from you, and, like a worm caught by a chicken, the whole flock will in turn catch it from each other, till it is either pulled in pieces, or gulphed down by ſome one at the hazard of choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.'</p>
               <p>'But that has nothing to do with liberty,' cried Frederick. 'All riches, and eſpecially hereditary riches, are to be conſidered as the ſalary of a ſinecure office, where the labourer and the manufacturer perform the duties, and the principal ſpends the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in luxury and idleneſs. Hereditary wealth is in reality a premium paid to idleneſs, an immenſe annuity expended to retain mankind in <hi>brutality</hi> and ignorance, by the want of leiſure (or time to be idle.) The <hi>rich</hi> are furniſhed indeed with the means of cultivation and literature, but they are paid for being diſſipated and indolent.

               <p>'You have made a very long ſpeech,' ſaid the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, 'on a very ſhort ſubject: All you have ſaid amounting to this, that the poor are ignorant, becauſe they have not leiſure to be idle, and the rich are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, becauſe they are paid to be idle; ſo that, in fact, all real knowledge centres in yourſelf; and I have very little doubt, but, in your eyes, all the reſt

               <p>'I will prove it by a demonſtrable argument,' cried Stupeo.</p>
               <p>'They are very deſtructive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ideas then,' ſaid Doctor Alogos. 'To ſay the truth, I am become quite ſick of ſociety, and all human nature togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.

               <p>'Oh!' cried Frederick, 'there the people are free;—there the ſpirit of truth ſought with irreſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible energy: republicans always fight with double ardour.'</p>
               <p>'Enthuſiaſm,' ſaid the gentleman, 'is no proof of either truth or juſtice; but it is certain to inſpire a deſperate ſpirit in thoſe who feel it, let the cauſe be liberty, religion, rebellion, revenge, plunder, or what not; though it is very well to aſcribe to the juſtice of the cauſe what in fact is only due to the intoxicating enthuſiaſm of attaining a point— Revenge in general inſpires revolutions. The people feel the evils they ſuffer under; they forget that a change moſt probably will be for the worſe; and to be revenged on one ſet of men, they become ſlaves of another. I believe there never yet hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened a revolution, where the then living genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not feel accumulated ill, and the benefit to the next is very doubtful.

               <p>The next day the Doctor began to arrange his plans of emigration, procuring all the information he could of that delectable country, where poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple live better than the rich; where proviſions are ſo plentiful, you have money to take them away; where more is paid to mechanics for their labour than the articles ſell for; where there are no taxes, and where the travellers <hi>bundle</hi> with the daughters of the family.</p>
               <p>Frederick felt his enthuſiaſm riſe at this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and determined to accompany the Doctor to Philadelphia, one of the fineſt and moſt regular ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the world.—'It is there,' ſaid he, 'we ſhall begin to breathe on the broad baſis of truth and reaſon; there all the puerile diſtinctions of religion and country are unknown, and man is reſpected for his good qualities.'</p>
               <p>Laura raiſed many objections to the ſcheme, and Suſan abſolutely, refuſed to truſt herſelf in a foreign country without being married. Thus the Doctor was under a philoſophical neceſſity of complying with a ſuperſtitious cuſtom; and he could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain obſerving, that if he would have ſubmitted to matrimony before, he might have married a lady of education and fortune, and not an ignorant pert baggage, who aſſumed the airs of a lady, without the qualifications.</p>
               <p>The eſtate and ruins of the manſion being ſold, the Doctor determined to ſet out without putting in his claim to the damages he could demand from the county.</p>
               <p>Frederick for a while ſuſpended his deſigns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Laura, foreſeeing, that when they ſhould be ſettled in a wilderneſs, ſhe muſt of neceſſity be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <head>CHAPTER XIV. Reflections in a ſtorm—the delights of Philadelphia— the Doctor purchaſes a large eſtate in Kentucky.</head>
               <p>A PLEASANT gale waſted theſe adventurers from the deteſtable iſland, where every thing was conducted in the worſe manner poſſible, and where law and religion influenced the majority of men. Their hopes were high, and they diſcourſed and diſputed with true metaphyſical ardour. The reſt of the paſſengers were mechanics and countrymen, going over to make their fortunes, and the praiſes of America bounded from one mouth to another.</p>
               <p>'I am aſtoniſhed,' ſaid a man who had ſold a very good trade to emigrate, 'I am aſtoniſhed that any man remains in Europe, when all the bleſſings of life await him in America. I am going to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe ſome lots of ground in the great city of Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, which will ſhortly be the moſt magnificent in the world. All the houſes will be poliſhed free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, the moſt narrow ſtreets will be as wide a Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Place in London. Ships already arrive there, and the city will be the emporium of commerce: I underſtand that it already makes a noble appearance.'</p>
               <p>'A very noble appearance indeed,' ſaid the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: 'the ſtreets are all laid out in right angles, upon paper. The number of workmen and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanics employed in building this magnificent city is truly aſtoniſhing, they amount to nearly one
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:038973_0167_101284421EDAB650"/>
hundred and fifty. But the chief advantage attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this city is, that it is contiguous to the eſtate of the Preſident.'</p>
               <p>'You ſpeak,' ſaid the paſſenger, 'as if you were an Engliſhman, and wiſhed to diſcourage new ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlers. I ſuppoſe you are jealous of others partaking in the pleaſures of your country.'</p>
               <p>'Very far from it,' ſaid the Captain. 'I am amuſed with the golden dreams of emigrants, who expect to find ſilver crows in America; and I can aſſure you what I tell you of Waſhington is literally true, and more than that, it never will be finiſhed, on account of the local and multiplied inconven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iences around it.'</p>
               <p>'But how comes it,' ſaid the other, 'that ſuch advertiſements are inſerted in the newſpapers?'</p>
               <p>'How comes it,' ſaid the Captain, 'you puff off any article you wiſh to diſpoſe of?—Do you think it is natural for a man, who has diſcovered a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to call all the world to ſhare it with him? This very reaſon ought to deter people, if they were not mad; they might be certain, if America was that happy land held out to them by deſigning men, all the vagabonds in Europe would not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to its bowers.'</p>
               <p>After they had ſailed many days before a fair wind, the heavens became ſuddenly obſcured; black clouds embattled over the deep, which hiſſed in riſing breakers againſt the ſhip's ſide. Sudden ſqualls furrow the dark boſom of the ocean, and threatened, to tear the ſails from the yards. All hands were ordered to work; the ſails were furled, the yards ſtruck, the pumps cleared, and every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration made for a ſtorm.'</p>
               <p>'My dear Doctor,' ſaid Frederick, in the cabin, 'now we ſhall behold a grand diſplay of magnificent ſcenery; we ſhall ſee Nature in a rage, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the terrific features of her countenance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="157" facs="unknown:038973_0168_10128448E77F9280"/>'I hope not,' ſaid the Doctor: 'I have no curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity to behold the bottom of the terrible ſea, to be hacked in pieces by the ſword-fiſh, ſmothered in the embraces of polypuſſes, or devoured by aligators.'</p>
               <p>'A true philoſopher,' cried Stupeo, 'will behold the combuſtion of elements with tranquillity; he would not tremble were all the human race ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered around his feet with a blaze of lightning; though the clouds were to become ignited and flame around his head; though the concave vault of the heavens was to become red hot; though the earth was to diſſolve with fulminations beneath his feet, and parting nature to mix in chaotic confuſion, yet would he ſtand firm and undiſmayed: Such are the effects of real philoſophy.'</p>
               <p>At that moment a loud craſh of thunder burſt over them, and rattled to a diſtance invarious directions.</p>
               <p>'The devil take it,' cried Stupeo, 'that is a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid ſmaſh; the wind howls like an hundred wolves in a foreſt hung with ſnow. The ſea thumps a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the veſſel as if it would break in the timbers. After all, men are very fooliſh to truſt themſelves ſo far from land in an egg-ſhell.'</p>
               <p>'It is nothing but an idea,' ſaid Laura. 'What, are you frightened at your own ideas?'</p>
               <p>'I am fearful,' ſaid the Doctor, 'that even Mr. Hume muſt al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ow this ſtorm to be ſomething more than idea.'</p>
               <p>'I ſhall go on deck,' ſaid Frederick. 'I am like an Engliſhman ſo far, that I am only afraid when I do not ſee the danger.'</p>
               <p>'I will go with you,' ſaid Laura; 'the ſhip trembles ſo much I cannot ſit.'</p>
               <p>It was with difficulty they could preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from falling, by graſping the hatchway; but the ſcene that preſented was the moſt terrible ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime. One univerſal canopy of black clouds ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:038973_0169_1012844BFA98FA00"/>
to unite the ocean with the heavens, and the rain poured down in ſuch torrents, that they might be ſaid to be overwhelmed in water; through this, the vivid flaſhes of lightning played at leiſure, dancing on the mountainous billows, and giving to the ridges of rolling waves, which tumbled over each other as if contending in a race, the momentary appearance of melting gold. The thunder was ſo near, that it appeared rather ſurrounding than above them, and the whole was a promiſcuous confuſion of fire and water, the waves reflecting and refracting the varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated lightnings in every direction.</p>
               <p>'Oh! great Creator of the univerſe,' ſaid Laura, a tear of piety ſtarting from her eye; 'Oh! that man would acknowledge thy power, for what pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents that thou ſhouldſt at this moment deſtroy the whole earth, and expunge it from thy preſence for the crimes of its people!'</p>
               <p>'Surely,' ſaid Frederick, 'this is more than idea;—there muſt be an omnipotent Being, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Mr. Hume and Stupeo. Were this ſtorm the production of chance, it might continue, it <hi>naturally</hi> would continue for ever, and overwhelm creation.'</p>
               <p>'Chance!' repeated Laura: 'How has it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that this whole globe has never deviated from its orb? Why do not the planets leave their harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic circles, and daſh each other to pieces?—Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony is not an attribute of chance, for the very word chance implies confuſion. Surely, had not ſome infinite Being, whom we ſhould tremble to name, given them their motions, they never could have continued within their orbit. But man, weak and ſilly man, denies Providence and miracles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Providence is not every day working miracles to provide him a dinner.'</p>
               <p>'That peal of thunder ſeemed to me to ſhake
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:038973_0170_1012844D9613B7D8"/>
the foundations of the univerſe,' ſaid Frederick;— 'but you look quite compoſed, Laura—are you not frightened?'</p>
               <p>'I am indeed,' ſaid ſhe, 'very much frightened, but I am not diſmayed.—It is true I am a weak woman, but I look beyond theſe heavy and ſulphur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious clouds, to a Deity who knows the weakneſs of his creatures, and can, in his omnipotence, as well protect me us a world.'</p>
               <p>'But do you think,' ſaid Frederick, 'that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards at all the actions of human beings? If he did<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why in the ſhipwreck of a veſſel ſhall perhaps every man be drowned, except the moſt execrable villain amongſt them?'</p>
               <p>'Becauſe that the good and the bad are ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected, that a ſtorm cannot fall upon one without touching the other, and to a good man drowning, is a very trifling evil.'</p>
               <p>'How ſo? You ſpeak now like a philoſopher. Is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t a trifle to be annihilated to ſelf-conſciouſneſs, to loſe all the pleaſures of life, and become no more than the ſtone or vegetating ſhrub?'</p>
               <p>'Indeed,' anſwered Laura, 'if ſuch are your ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, death is to you the moſt tremendous of evils—you muſt ſhudder at the idea, and to ſecure yourſelf ſome paltry, tranſient gratifications, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate unnumbered crimes. But, amidſt this ſtorm, when the next moment may whelm us beneath the deep, ſee how calm a woman can be, whoſe mind is acted upon by the cheering hopes of religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and who expects hereafter to live to a beatified eternity.'</p>
               <p>'But I have no ideas of ſuch a ſtate, and we know that the vulgar notion of an heaven above us cannot phyſically be true.'</p>
               <p>'And why not?' ſaid Laura;—'you will tell me perhaps, that beyond our ſyſtem there are other ſyſtems, and beyond theſe others, reaching to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:038973_0171_10128450A5227458"/>
ſurpaſſing comprehenſion. But, is ſpace bounded by our imagination, or is all ſpace filled with ſyſtems? Beyond all theſe ſyſtems may there not be a ſurrounding ſpace, where every idea of heaven may be realized, where new regions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable formation and glory may exiſt, for who ſhall limit the Supreme? Even ſuppoſe all ſpace to be filled with ſyſtems and worlds, may not theſe ſtars be ſo many different paradiſes, fitting the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of different ſpirits?'</p>
               <p>'Theſe things,' ſaid Frederick, 'may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible; but they are very contrary to the doctrine of the great Stupeo. What a grand ſcene is he loſing!—I will go and call him.'</p>
               <p>The ſtorm now raged with ſuch violence, that the ſhip was given to the winds, driving between the furrows of the ruſhing waves. The great Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peo laid upon the cabin floor, uttering the moſt horrid execrations—ſwearing that all hell was broke looſe, and that the black demons of the air were running the ſhip into the clouds.</p>
               <p>'That is a very ſublime idea,' ſaid Frederick, 'but I hope not literal, for if there be an hell, what will become of us?'</p>
               <p>'O God!' cried Doctor Alogos, 'I do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge thy power, I was a fool ever to doubt it.'</p>
               <p>Laura endeavoured to comfort poor Suſan and the reſt of the paſſengers in the cabin; and the better to prevent reflection, ſhe deſired them to ſing ſome pſalms, ſetting the example by beginning the 104th. The novelty of ſuch an action in ſo deſpairing a ſituation gained their attention, and many joining in, the terror of the danger was damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and they felt a ſomething of conſcious ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which is unknown to any but thoſe who have been in ſome ſimilar ſituation, or have felt the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of a quiet conſcience;—even Stupeo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:038973_0172_1012845492BD5918"/>
changed his execrations into groans, and Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick hung down his head in ſilent reflection.</p>
               <p>The ſtorm gradually ſubſiding by degrees, the ſeveral characters of the company returned, with this difference, that Stupeo maintained with more obſtinacy than ever his doctrine of chance and ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm. Frederick wavered in his mind according to the impulſe of his paſſions; and Doctor Alogos became convinced that there was more in religion and <hi>common-place</hi> maxims of good and evil, than the great Stupeo would allow.</p>
               <p>In this diſpoſition they arrived at Philadelphia, and rejoiced at the proſpect of having reached a place where truth and juſtice had erected the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of reaſon. Frederick was ſurpriſed to find the renowned city not ſo large as that part of Mary-le-Bone which is built; but conſoled himſelf with the loſs of one of the fineſt cities in the world, as he could look over the ground where it <hi>was</hi> to ſtand.</p>
               <p>As they paſſed along the ſtreets, they were hoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at by the children, and called vagabond Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, with other opprobrious names. 'This is very ſtrange,' ſaid Frederick: 'I thought the Americans made no diſtinctions of country; but we are only ſtrangers yet—they will reſpect us when they know us better.'</p>
               <p>They procured lodgings at an extravagant rate, and calling for refreſhment, received ſome very coarſe cakes, wretched butter, and ſalt meat, for in ſummer no <hi>freſh</hi> meat will keep a day; and for this they paid more than the beſt articles would have coſt in London.</p>
               <p>'Things are not quite as they ſhould be even here,' ſaid the Doctor.</p>
               <p>'What do you mean by that?' ſaid an American
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:038973_0173_101284563473F2B0"/>
                  <hi>waiter.</hi> 'Do you mean to ſtigmatize Congreſs?'</p>
               <p>'Heaven forbid,' replied the Doctor: 'I ſhould like to ſpeak to your maſter about my bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage.'</p>
               <p>'My maſter! I dont know ſuch a man. Do you think I am a ſlave?—I am a republican, a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born American. But who are you? ſome louſy, beggarly emigré, come here to cut wood and hew ſtone for us.'</p>
               <p>Doctor Alogos looked in ſilent amazement.— Frederick was riſing to kick the republican down ſtairs; but Stupeo obſerved that this was the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine blunt ſpirit of freedom; that, like Spartans, the Americans took perfect liberty of ſpeech.</p>
               <p>'But they do not ſeem to allow it to others,' ſaid Laura.</p>
               <p>The heat was extremely intenſe, ſo much ſo, that the whole company confined themſelves within doors, deliberating on the mode they ſhould adopt in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting their paſtoral ſcheme. Laura amuſed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at the windows: to her it had an air of novelty to ſee every third perſon a black; but ſhe was aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed to ſee the people labouring notwithſtanding the violent heat, which was almoſt ſuffocating to thoſe who remained inactive; and the ſwarms of muſquetoes were to Engliſhmen a perfect plague.</p>
               <p>'Theſe labourers,' ſaid a waiting maid, 'are Scotch, Iriſh, and German emigrants, who earn <hi>eleven ſhillings</hi> a day currency.</p>
               <p>'Eleven ſhillings a day!' exclaimed Frederick; 'it is more than our peaſants in England earn in a week: they muſt live like noblemen. But what do you call currency?'</p>
               <p>'Why it is about ſix and ſix-pence Engliſh; but they are very badly off for all that, for every thing
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:038973_0174_101284597AAC62C0"/>
is ſo dear they can hardly live upon it, and one half of them ſoon die of fevers and agues.'</p>
               <p>The landlord's daughter was a prettyiſh girl, and night coming on, Frederick requeſted her to <hi>bundle</hi> with him. 'If you inſult me,' ſaid ſhe, 'our Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew ſhall bundle you into the Delaware.'</p>
               <p>Frederick was aſtoniſhed at this frankneſs. It is very different here, ſaid he to himſelf; but I do not know whether it is all for the better.</p>
               <p>In the night Frederick was diſturbed by the rum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of carts:—It is very ſtrange, thought he, that ſo many nightmen are at work at once in ſuch a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle city, or perhaps they all come through this ſtreet. The Americans ſurely do not go in carts to balls. In the morning he inquired, and was informed it was only the <hi>dead carts</hi> that carried away thoſe who died in the courſe of the day.</p>
               <p>'That is ſtrange,' ſaid he, 'I counted near twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and this city is of very narrow extent.' 'It is a very magnificent city, and the largeſt in all the union,' ſaid the landlord;—'but the yellow fever carries off ſome dozens in a day; however, we don't mind theſe things ſince we have got our inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence.'</p>
               <p>'Very true,' replied the Doctor: 'liberty ſweetens every thing, and it is a glorious epoch in the annals of man, that property ceaſes in this great weſtern continent to influence the actions of men.'</p>
               <p>The landlord gazed with ſurpriſe. 'Property,' ſaid he, 'is the only ſtimulus to commerce—com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce is the ſupport of arts and ſciences, and no man will be above trade: we have no honeſt gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen here—no idle hands—if a man will not work, he may ſtarve.'</p>
               <p>'That is a deteſtable ſyſtem,' ſaid Stupeo; 'the ancient Spartans never degraded themſelves with work. Man, in a ſtate of nature, does not work,
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:038973_0175_1012845E3326F880"/>
he has few wants, and theſe the waters or the woods ſupply.'</p>
               <p>'That may be, friend; but our motto is, <hi>endure, but hope,</hi> and that of all new-comers is, <hi>work, or ſtarve.</hi> I ſee you are a green-one yet, and unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned; all you people from the old world think money is made for nothing here— but it is all a farce.'</p>
               <p>'Where in the world,' ſaid the Doctor, 'ſhall we find the genuine principles of liberty and equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?'</p>
               <p>'As to liberty,' ſaid the American, 'every man has liberty to follow any trade he pleaſes, and to vote for the Congreſs, if he is a naturalized citizen; and as to equality, we have no titles except <hi>'ſquire,</hi> but for equality of property, as ſome of our own people would like it, it is a mere fire-fly of a dark evening.'</p>
               <p>The idea of the yellow fever had damped the ſpirits of the whole company, and it was reſolved to quit the city of Philadelphia with all convenient ſpeed. This matter was under conſideration when a thin man entered the room.</p>
               <p>'My good friends,' ſaid he, 'I underſtand you intend ſettling upon an agricultural plan. Agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture is the moſt noble purſuit of independent man, and a ſure ſource of wealth.' 'How did you know our intention?' ſaid the Doctor: 'we have not yet been twenty-four hours in the city.'</p>
               <p>'My deſire to ſerve all mankind,' replied he, 'and to prevent the ſchemes of impoſtors, who, taking advantage of their local knowledge, often deceive and cheat ſtrangers, has led me to intrude upon you.'</p>
               <p>'Indeed,' ſaid Alogos, 'I thought all the people of the new world had been diſintereſted and benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:038973_0176_1012845FCE112E58"/>
towards all mankind, who fly from the old world to be free of its crimes.'</p>
               <p>'Human nature, Sir, is not yet arrived at per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: It is true we are advancing rapidly forward —witneſs the great public roads and canals which interſect the country.'</p>
               <p>'Why are theſe roads?' ſaid Frederick: 'You ought to throw every impediment in the way of commerce—it is thence ariſes all our evils.'</p>
               <p>'That is very true, Sir, but in this country to talk diſreſpectfully of commerce is high treaſon: we are a commercial people. By means of theſe roads and canals, we have peopled the great wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and planted ſettlements where only rattle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnakes uſed to baſk. To what part of the continent do you intend journeying?'</p>
               <p>'That we are undetermined upon,' ſaid the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: 'we would be as far from ſociety as we can, and in a country where we can enjoy the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of nature.'</p>
               <p>'Then Kentucky is your object; it is the moſt delectable ſpot on the face of the earth; it is a ſecond Arcadia—a continued ſcene of romantic delight, and pictureſque proſpects.

               <p>'Twelve guineas for the hundred acres!' ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the Doctor: 'why you miſtake, you are giving the land away. Ah! if all the poor vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonds in the old world knew that here they could have a portion of earth for almoſt nothing, they would beg, borrow, or ſteal, to procure a paſſage to this land of milk and honey.'</p>
               <p>'There are thouſands every year,' ſaid the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, 'who benefit by our hoſpitality. If I might adviſe, this plat of ground, ſituated on the north fork of the Elkhorn, is the moſt eligible for a firſt ſettlement.</p>
               <p>'Well,' ſaid the Doctor, 'if you bring me the title deeds and witneſſes, I will purchaſe that: A thouſand acres is juſt an hundred and eight guineas, and that is a mere ſong.'</p>
               <p>'Indeed,' ſaid Common, with a ſtare, 'you ſhall have the deeds drawn out and regiſtered with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion.'—This being ſettled, he obſerved, that at ſuch a diſtance, they would require to take with them various implements of huſbandry, and articles of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, every thing being tripled in expence beyond the Alleghany mountains.</p>
               <p>'But why,' ſaid Frederick, 'ſhould we encumber ourſelves with articles of luxury? We intend to quit ſociety, and will not load ourſelves with its inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences.'</p>
               <p>'My dear Sir,' ſaid Common, 'you advance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the mark; ſo much do we depend upon each other, that we can neither begin nor proceed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the co-operations of our fellows: For inſtance, how will you cultivate the earth?

ſpades and ploughs, and a variety of other articles.'</p>
               <p>'We are obliged to have all theſe in England,' ſaid Frederick: 'I do not ſee that labour is leſs or more eaſy in the new world than the old.'</p>
               <p>'Infinitely ſo,' cried Common; 'farmers here work for themſelves, wages are ſo high that they cannot afford to hire men, and land is ſo cheap that ſervants ſoon become maſters.'</p>
               <p>'That is as it ſhould be,' ſaid Stupeo, 'that is ſomething like equality. In our country, a farmer, with a few hundred acres does little more than over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look his ſervants.'</p>
               <p>Under the directions of Common, near a thouſand pounds were expended in articles neceſſary for a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement—the patent was made out at the regular office, and four waggons waited the pleaſure of theſe great men, who quitted the haunts of luxury in ſearch of virtue and liberty in an howling wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>Every article as they paſſed along the road was exorbitantly dear, ſeventeen dollars being charged for a common dinner for themſelves and their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; but what more aſtoniſhed them, was the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence of the inn-keepers, who being all agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural men, did not altogether depend on their inns, and conceived travellers to be the obliged par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>'This is very ſingular hoſpitality,' ſaid the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: 'I have read a book which informed me it was cuſtomary to travel from farm-houſe to farm-houſe, and from New-England to Maryland, almoſt free of expenſe.'</p>

               <p>As they advanced over the mountains to Fort Pitt, they were charmed with the ſcenery, and the majeſtic river Ohio, down which they ſailed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween extenſive ſavannas and high-towering for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts, where ſcarcely the beams of day, much leſs the foot of man, ever penetrated.</p>
               <p>Stupeo, who was a man of profound reflection, was frequently ſubject to melancholy, to diſſipate which, he had recourſe to peach brandy and Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican rum, (indeed theſe mingled with water are the common drink); but though he was no milkſop, he was ſoon ſeized with a dyſentery, which to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort he found was very uſual to new comers.</p>
               <p>Being arrived at Lexington, the metropolis of the fineſt country in the world, they were a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at ſight of about thirty ill-looking wooden houſes, but they had ſeen ſo many wonders in the new world, that they were not altogether confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Stupeo declared that he was delighted at the proſpect of coming nearer a ſtate of nature than they had even hoped or expected.</p>
               <p>Their large train of baggage was a ſufficient ſign of importance to procure them ſeveral viſitors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by this means the place of their intended ſettlement was quickly known, and a great deal of unneceſſary trouble avoided, there being already a family at Lexington, come from Virginia, with a grant for the ſame land, which they were unable to ſettle, it being already in the poſſeſſion of another holder.</p>
               <p>'This is inconceivable,' ſaid Doctor Alogos; 'one had need poſſeſs a ſhare of <hi>ſuffering</hi> philoſophy to endure this; but how am I to be righted?'</p>
               <p>'You may go to law,' replied the informant. 'I am an attorney, and will do you juſtice; for

               <p>'Go to law!' cried the Doctor with horror; 'what are there laws and lawyers in a wilderneſs? I expected to have found nothing worſe than rattle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnakes and tigers.'</p>
               <p>'The world could not exiſt without law,' ſaid the lawyer. 'Why, it is almoſt impoſſible to purchaſe a lot of land here without a law-ſuit entailed, for at the office they grant patent upon patent, ſo that any man may chooſe what part he prefers of the whole country, and when he is here he cannot eaſily return.'</p>
               <p>'That is right,' cried Stupeo, 'that is exactly my ſyſtem of argument, the greateſt reſulting good is the firſt to be defined; the wilderneſs muſt be peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled, and the human race expanded over the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the earth.'</p>

               <head>CHAPTER XV. The Pleaſures of bending Nature to the rules of art— Stupeo and Suſan determine to People the wilderneſs— the Superiority of ſavage life exemplified.</head>
               <p>HAVING made a purchaſe of three hundred acres, about one hundred and fifty miles from Lex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, nearer the Ohio, containing two fine mill-ſeats, with water-carriage for timber, they began their march through the wilderneſs. Every ten or twelve miles along the road a little plantation was begun. Laura looked in vain for the blooming orchards and ſugar-groves, with fine lawns beneath them; ſhe ſaw indeed ſome cluſters of ſugar-maple trees at intervals in the woods, where <hi>Nature</hi> had planted them; but as to the velvet meadows, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that ſort appeared, the native graſs being ſeveral feet high, matted ſo as to be almoſt impaſſable, and too rank for any uſe. The weather was inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferably hot—millions of inſects tormented them night and day—ſnakes curled along the tracks (called roads) and prodigious large frogs and toads wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every little tank of ſtagnant water, which the impenetrable foreſt prevented the ſun from evapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating.</p>
               <p>Neither milk nor butter were procurable at any price, and they were under the neceſſity of drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirits and water, which threw them all into ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ight fevers, and added ſtrength to the diſeaſe of Stupeo.</p>
               <p>Being arrived at the place where they were to
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:038973_0183_101284760271B3B0"/>
ſettle, they were a little ſurpriſed to find it covered with prodigious large trees, which ſeemed to bid defiance to human labour. A thick cane brake over-ran half the ſurface, and was ſo matted and entangled with the trees, that they could not even clear a path through. The ground, which was not thus covered, was apparently ſo barren, that the black heaths of England were a ſort of comparative garden.</p>
               <p>'It is plain to me,' ſaid Stupeo, 'that cultivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ground is a deviation from the ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Has ſhe not ſpread her wide extended branches to ſhelter us from heat and from rain? Has ſhe not ſcattered various fruits and ſhrubs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our reach, and what do we want more? When we ſhall have ſpent our ſtrength in deſtroying theſe trees, and laboured to raiſe the rotten ſods into life, ſhall we not ſet ſome value on the earth? We ſhall become proud, ſelfiſh and tyrannical—we ſhall not readily yield it to another, and thus we give birth to all the horrors of civil life.'</p>
               <p>'It is too late now to retract,' ſaid Laura; 'ſurely the reſources of philoſophy are not exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, reaſon and truth have now full power to expand unchecked in the deſert wild.'</p>
               <p>'To be perfectly free,' ſaid Stupeo, 'we ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like the roaming Indians; let us give to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind a great and glorious example? Let us caſt aſide our cloths, they are an incumbrance beneath the dignity of virtue, let us live like the wild In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.'</p>
               <p>'You may if you like' ſaid Laura, laughing, 'but I fear you will not eaſily do without brandy, and that is a forbidden article in the big book of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.'</p>
               <p>'For my part,' ſaid Frederick, 'I will try the inconveniences of a detached life before I wholly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  </gap>avagiſm; we have contracted ſo many unnatural wants, which reaſon knows to be uſeleſs, that it requires time to root out our habits and prejudices.'</p>
               <p>In about a week's time, an uncomfortable hovel was erected, with the help of ſome neighbours; but theſe philoſophers had ſo little reſolution in encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering great difficulties, that theſe three great men were another week before they had cut off the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er boughs of a few trees, where they had planned a kitchen garden.</p>
               <p>Stupeo was thrown off his legs with the little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion he had made, the heat and the bad proviſions, no meat, keeping without ſalt. No phyſician was within many miles, except one, an ignorant quack, whoſe whole knowledge was drawn from Salmon's Diſpenſatory, and the London Complete Art of Healing.</p>
               <p>Stupeo pretended he rejoiced that Nature would have her courſe; but ſhe ſoon ſo reduced him, that it was evident the great man would quit the world without having cauſed one revolution; and the Doctor diſpatched a meſſenger for the ſurgeon, who, on his arrival, preſcribed ſome common medicines, which greatly relieved the patient.</p>
               <p>Doctor Alogos lamented the want of books, though he had very little time to read; what leiſure he had was ſpent in idle repining, and curſing the day he ever ſet his foot on the new world, which to his eyes appeared only half formed. He had anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſubject of diſquiet in Suſan, who was every day reproaching him with having carried her out of the world to die in a deſart. Laura was the only one any way contented, for the ſweetneſs of her diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, and her affection for her uncle, overlooked ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulties. Surely, thought the Doctor, there is ſomething at leaſt very pleaſant in the attachment
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:038973_0185_1012847B59632928"/>
of kindred, and though ſhe may love me as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, contrary to the new philoſophy, I do not perceive any great evil in it.</p>
               <p>The progreſs they made in cultivation ſerved only to ſhew them the futility of their undertaking and a whole family happening to die of a fever occaſioned by over-labour, they purchaſed the farm, which had been brought into ſome degree of cultivation.— The ground, which had never been turned up to the air, being compoſed of rotten vegetable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, was loaded with febrile particles and noxious vapour, the effects of which are frequently ſeen in the deaths of new comers; nor did the Doctor and Frederick eſcape without a ſevere fit of the ague, which diſabled them from labour.</p>
               <p>The great Stupeo ſeemed here buried in unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy obſcurity; he ſaw his genius and talents unem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, and mankind unbenefited by his labours. He had fruitleſsly attempted to injure the innocence of Laura, who deteſted him even more than Fred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erick; and he reſolved no longer to ſuffer the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt monoply which Doctor Alogos practiſed in the perſon of Suſan. The latter was heartily tired of the Doctor, who was not ſo young as Stupeo, and having imbibed the real principles of equality, ſhe made very little difficulty of aiding to people this wilderneſs, where, it muſt be confe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſed, there was a little too much of ſolitude.</p>
               <p>The Doctor beheld, as a ſingular phenomenon, the change of Suſan's ſhape, which neither reaſon nor argument could account for, though it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent there muſt have been a cauſe ſuperior to chance.</p>
               <p>'It may be nothing more than an idea,' ſaid Stupeo; 'but at any rate it does not ſignify who is the parent of the child—the reſul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="175" facs="unknown:038973_0186_1012847E714E73A8"/>
the protection of philoſophy, its mind will gradually expand to the genial beams of truth. I am of opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, that children ſhould be brought up indifferently by the male or female, as it may happen. Why, I would aſk, in the name of common ſenſe, are not men as well calculated for nurſes as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men?'</p>
               <p>'Becauſe,' ſaid Laura, 'they are not ſo domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, and becauſe Providence has provided the female with a nutriment adapted to the tenderneſs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy.'</p>
               <p>'That ariſes from mere repletion,' ſaid the great philoſopher, 'and is the ſource of all our diſeaſes— we draw in corruption at the breaſt, and if we would one day become immortal, I am of opinion we ſhould be educated independent from the birth, and fed upon ſomething more natural than milk, which is of all ſubſtances ſooneſt corrupted.'</p>
               <p>'Of courſe upon brandy,' ſaid Laura: 'brandy is one of the leaſt corruptible of fluids.'</p>
               <p>Suſan, in due time, brought a man child into the world; but no phyſician or perſon of ſkill being within reach, an ignorant old woman officiated, and the poor wretch expired in agony.</p>
               <p>'Such,' cried Stupeo, 'are the conſequences of being neither in or out of ſociety:—Here we are in a deſart, abandoned by our ſpecies, with all the habits we contracted in ſociety, and no means to ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfy them;—if we had been in a ſtate of nature, nature would have accompliſhed every thing.'</p>
               <p>The Doctor was ſhocked at the event, though ſatisfied ſhe had not been conſtant to himſelf; and he more than ever began to doubt the reality and practicability of the ſublime doctrines of the new philoſophy. Stupeo undertook the education of the boy, whom he inſiſted ſhould enjoy perfect freedom,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:038973_0187_1012848136417EF0"/>
and be allowed to crawl about the houſe like any other animal.</p>
               <p>'He ſhall not be thwarted in any thing,' ſaid he: 'The great Rouſſeau tells us that we only implan vices into children by pretending to teach them juſtice, and deſtroy the temper by checking the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of imagination.' Unfortunately for the enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened ſyſtem of education, this grand experiment proved abortive. The tender infant ſickened and died of a conſumption.</p>
               <p>Frederick, however, maintained that it was the kindneſs of Laura which killed it;. and Stupeo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that it was ſtung to death by muſquetoes, its body being delicate, and not plaiſtered over with unguents of greaſe, like the infants of Indians; and the Doctor ſwore that Stupeo had poiſoned it with brandy. Thus theſe three great men could not agree upon ſo inſignificant a thing as the death of a child under a grand philoſophical experiment: Where then is the wonder that men are daily outting each others throats for difference of political opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion?</p>
               <p>One day when theſe three philoſophers were la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring in the field, ſometimes uttering execrations, and ſometimes diſputing, not a little to the prejudice of <hi>immutible</hi> truth, which often appeared in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſhapes, a troop of Miama Indians croſſed the Ohio in their punts, and carried off all the portable articles at the little farm, which they had dignified with the name of Clarens. Poor Laura ſhared the fate of the reſt of the ſtock, and it was not known to the philoſophers till their return home.</p>
               <p>'Black forever be the day!' exclaimed the Doctor, 'when I left England with all its evils— there, perſons and property enjoy ſome protection. Alas! my dear Laura, my beloved child is murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſcalped!'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="unknown:038973_0188_101284858EC9CFF8"/>'Nothing more natural,' ſaid Stupeo, coolly; 'ſavages do not make thoſe childiſh diſtinctions we do between beauty and uglineſs—revenge is all they ſeek, for the unjuſt uſurpation of the Europeans:— Are we not driving them from their ancient poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and daily narrowing their bounds and power to live?'</p>
               <p>'What have they done,' ſaid the Doctor, 'in the courſe of ſome thouſand years? The utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of their knowledge in agriculture, is the plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a few ſlips of maize and tobacco.'</p>
               <p>'But they enjoy perfect liberty,' ſaid Frederick; 'they have few vices; and few wants— they roam at will over the face of the creation:—I feel myſelf enamoured of ſavage life<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>It is the practice of the new ſchool to exalt every thing ſavage. An Indian is with them the moſt virtuous of human beings; and they make him utter ſentiments he never heard, and perform actions which never were witneſſed. Why is all this but to looſen men from the reciprocal bonds of ſociety, and to ſap the foundations of human governments. So far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are the Indians removed from, theſe <hi>ſentimental phantoms,</hi> that they are totally the contrary; though the emancipation of the negroes, and the inhumanity of Chriſtians, is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtalking horſe, for thoſe who pretend to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>'The inſurrections, maſſacres, and cruelties of St. Domingo, would make a large volume, were they to be detailed.

               <p>'My life,' cried Alogos, 'is a burden in this wilderneſs:—I have no books to amuſe and inſtruct me—no intercourſe of poliſhed friendſhip, all is rugged and rude. There is <hi>no market</hi> for commod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities that might ſtimulate avarice. I feel a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand wants I cannot gratify, and even common ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries I cannot procure.—Affection, which I once thought a blind partiality, I now find like a balm amidſt the evils of life; and as I have loſt my Laura, I am completely wretched. I am not now equal to the taſk of cultivating the ground; and I might have procured more comforts, conveniences, and luxuries in England, as a day labourer, than in this wild with all its freedom.'</p>
               <p>'I muſt grant,' ſaid Frederick, 'that we have too much labour: this is not a ſtate congenial to human nature—this is ſolitude without its concomitants, plenty, liberty, and eaſe. What ſignifies my being at liberty to w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>'For me,' ſaid the Doctor, 'I am ſo completely wretched, that I will ſeek no further for a bauble — I will die here.'</p>
               <p>'The great moraliſt, Rouſſeau,' ſaid Stupeo,
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:038973_0190_1012848A36CE5988"/>
'has ſaid, <hi>by rendering life inſupportable, God orders one to quit it.</hi> Now you believe in a Deity, and ſurely you may truſt his mercy.'</p>
               <p>'I will not provoke his anger, thou fiend of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,' ſaid Doctor Alogos, with more energy than he uſually diſplayed: 'do I ſuffer one ſingle incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience I have not brought upon myſelf, and you would have me cloſe the account with murder. The Deity does not act by evils, nor are the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of our head-ſtrong paſſions, our follies, and our crimes to be laid to his charge. Rouſſeau was a fool, with all his rants and declamations, and many of his followers ſhew their long ears.'</p>
               <p>A black ſlave, whom theſe advocates for univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal freedom had <hi>purchaſed,</hi> his labour being cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than an hired ſervant, now entered the hut, with the tidings that Laura had been ſeen croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Ohio, with the Indians, in a weſtern direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Doctor Alogos, at this intelligence, rouſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to action, and the two philoſophers propoſed to accompany him, more from an expectance of novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than any deſire to recover Laura, who would never attend to the lectures of theſe great men.</p>
               <p>They ſet out on horſeback well armed, purſuing the track pointed out to them. For four days they followed the Indians, till their proviſions were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, and their horſes nearby jaded out. They ſubſiſted upon the wild berries and fruit in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts, ſtill continuing their rout, and having plenty of powder the birds ſupplied them a frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt.</p>
               <p>By degrees they loſt all knowledge of the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the country. Their horſes fell beneath them, and the underwood became almoſt impenetrable.— A council of war was called, in which Frederick pleaded ſtrenuouſly that they ſhould join the firſt band of Indians they might meet, and caſt away
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:038973_0191_1012848C40FA0BB8"/>
every trace of ſociety; he even propoſed that they ſhould abandon their arms and clothes, and truſt wholly to chance.</p>
               <p>This he was prevailed upon to give up, by the obſervance that the Indians were not ſo diveſted of all art as to be without arms, theſe being neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in a roaming life to procure themſelves food.</p>
               <p>Doctor Alogos, who had no wiſh to return with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his niece, complied with all the ſublime whims of theſe great men; and though he was far from being in perfect health, he attended them through the dreary labyrinths of an almoſt impaſſable foreſt, where hunger and thirſt were their conſtant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions.</p>
               <p>For near ten days they did not ſee a ſingle human being except themſelves. They had fallen in with a drove of buffaloes, on one of which they made a plentiful repaſt. Their ſhoes were already worn out, and the green hide bound with thongs ſupplied the place; though they now ran conſiderable haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard from the ſwarms of ſnakes which baſked in the ſun, or hung from the trees like caterpillars in an Engliſh hedge. Frederick being the talleſt, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſeveral ſevere confuſions from the boughs of the trees, and the infinite ſwarms of muſquetoes which ſeemed to fill the air, goaded the whole party inceſſantly.</p>
               <p>Some Indians they accidentally fell in with, ran away from them in terror. In the woods they found ſeveral ſkeletons, which, from their mutilated ſtate, appeared to have been killed in battle.</p>
               <p>'It is very ſingular,' ſaid Frederick, 'that even theſe ſavages, who are very little more advanced in civil life than an Ouran-outang, ſhould delight ſo much in war.</p>
               <p>'War,' replied Stupeo, 'is congenial to human nature:—what, are all the civilized ſtates that now exiſt immerſed in voluptuouſneſs and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

the manly virtues are loſt, when arts and ſciences are cultivated. Look back to the ancients—the Celtae, the Danes, the Goths, the Scythians, and all thoſe hardy tribes who lived only in war, we ſhall there find all the heroic virtues, the contempt of danger, the bravery of ſeaſons, the generoſity of friendſhip, and the gallantry to the fair, ſo peculiar to the times of chivalry — all theſe are the children of a ſtate of perpetual war.'</p>
               <p>'I thought,' ſaid the Doctor, 'you held gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in contempt, as a puſillanimous trifling, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy a great mind; and that particular friendſhips are an outrage againſt political juſtice.'</p>
               <p>'So I do,' cried Stupeo? 'and whoever knew me retract what I once advanced?'</p>
               <p>'But how do you reconcile the contradiction?'</p>
               <p>'A philoſopher can reconcile every thing.—The new philoſophy is founded upon the broad expanded baſis of univerſal truth; it eſtabliſhes principles not all the powers of kings and prieſts ſhall overthrow, much leſs a few contradictions.'</p>
               <p>This warm debate was interrupted by ſome fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male ſcreams. The Doctor cocked his rifle piece, and the whole company moved towards the place, where, in a little retreat, they ſaw an Indian ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beating two women with a cane.</p>
               <p>'This is very aſtoniſhing gallantry,' ſaid Doctor Alogos, 'this is a warlike people; but let us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what is the reaſon of this uſage.'</p>
               <p>Their black ſervant, Mungo, who underſtood the dialect of the five nations, inquired the meaning of the chaſtiſement.</p>
               <p>'Becauſe I chooſe it,' ſaid the Indian: 'I have a great mind to ſhoot them both with my arrow.'</p>
               <p>'Well, but you have ſome cauſe for your anger,'
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:038973_0193_101284931B37D1B8"/>
ſaid the Doctor, through the medium of Mungo.— 'To be ſure I have:—I ordered them to ſhoot ſome plovers for my dinner, while I was painting myſelf with this delightful blue, and they return to tell me they can find none.'</p>
               <p>'I ſuppoſe,' ſaid the Doctor, 'you are related to them?'—'They are my wives.'—'One of them is very young.'—'She is my daughter.'<note n="*" place="bottom">See Byron's Narrative, Cook's Voyages. Loſs of the Groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venor. &amp;c.</note>—'What, do you uſe your daughter as a wife?'—To be ſure I do—have not I the moſt right to my own? Does not Nature and the great Manetaw of the lakes tell us to do ſo?'</p>
               <p>'We muſt acknowledge,' ſaid the Doctor, 'this is very ſtrange;—the women appear univerſally to be ſlaves to the men; but, alas! what a mere brute is man, when ſome greater law than his own will does not curb his paſſions. If this be liberty, bind me forever to a galley oar.'</p>
               <p>'I find nothing ſtrange in all this,' ſaid Stupeo. 'Theſe men are ignorant of the ſublime doctrines of philoſophy—they do things without ſeeing their fitneſs, and therefore may err a little in promoting univerſal good; for inſtance, what is there unnatur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al in this revolution of kindred; is it not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice with animals?'</p>
               <p>'What horrid principles,' ſaid Alogos: 'how would it be poſſible to rear brothers and ſiſters to maturity?'</p>
               <p>'That is none of my buſineſs,' replied Stupeo; 'I do not concern myſelf with trifles.'</p>
               <p>Doctor Alogos felt the truth of this reply; and having witneſſed the brilliant virtues of a warlike nation in the ſavage ſtate, he concluded that the whole human ſpecies was under ſome dreadful

               <p>The following day they croſſed a large ſavanna, where they could not procure the ſmalleſt ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and in the evening tired and exhauſted, they arrived at a little ſettlement of Indians.</p>
               <p>'Now,' cried Frederick; in rapture, 'we ſhall behold genuine hoſpitality; we ſhall ſee pure nature, unſophiſticated by the vices of ſociety?</p>
               <p>They requeſted of an Indian, in an humble tone, ſome hoe-cake, but received for anſwer, that they had ſcarcely ſufficient for themſelves, and a demand of ſome of their arms.</p>
               <p>This was very unexpected to theſe philoſophers, who, notwithſtanding their knowledge of human nature, often made egregious miſtakes, and finding pity and hoſpitality alike unknown, they bargained for a ſupply of proviſions, in exchange for a brace of piſtols and ſome ſhot.</p>
               <p>'Theſe men,' ſaid Stupeo, 'muſt have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminated by trading with Europeans, at leaſt they poſſeſs the virtues of ſacred friendſhip; with them the ſecurity of oaths is unneceſſary.'</p>
               <p>'Sacred friendſhip!' ſaid Doctor Alogos; 'you are a profound philoſopher— you can acknowledge what you ſtand in need of:—you deny and affirm juſt as it ſuits your then convenience.'</p>
               <p>'And what is the uſe of words,' returned the other, 'if we are not to turn them to our own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage?'</p>
               <p>Having with difficulty procured leave to repoſe in one of the wigwams, they made many inquiries into the ſituation of the country, but received no ſatisfactory anſwer, and from the tone of their dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, they appeared to be a tribe beyond any that had immediate connexion with Europeans. They lay down upon ſome long graſs; their wearineſs
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:038973_0195_1012849A6732F150"/>
cauſed them to ſleep particularly ſound, and they were not a little amazed to find in the morning moſt of their clothes ſtolen, with two of their fowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pieces.</p>
               <p>'So much for ſavage honeſty and juſtice,' ſaid Alogos: 'they are a parcel of raſcally thieves, and where is their ſacred hoſpitality in leaving us here to periſh in a wild, without arms or clothes; for we have ſaved nothing but what we kept on our backs, or concealed beneath the graſs at the requeſt of Mungo.'</p>
               <p>'In the firſt place,' ſaid Stupeo, 'we have no right to complain, they have not taken our lives, which, from our imprudence, was in their power; and in the ſecond, we miſtake terms. In ſociety, I grant this would be called a robbery, but, amongſt the children of nature, it is only taking from anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er what they want to uſe themſelves; they have not our ideas of particular property.'</p>
               <p>'It ſeems to me however,' ſaid Frederick, 'that they were conſcious of injuſtice, or they would not all have departed in this ſneaking way. I begin to think the ſavage ſtate of man is not conducted on philoſophical principles.'</p>
               <p>'That is what I have been ſaying all the time,' cried Stupeo. 'Liſten while I explain to you the progreſs of human nature, from groſs darkneſs to ſuperſtition; from ſuperſtition to the great light of truth; and from thence to philoſophical ignorance, which is the genuine ſtate of real felicity.'</p>
               <p>'You might as well talk of the light darkneſs of the full noon of night,' cried the Doctor in a rage. 'I will demonſtrate it,' cried Stupeo.—'You contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict yourſelf,' ſaid Frederick; 'I will prove that phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy—</p>

               <p>OUR troop of philoſophical vagabonds ſet out, they knew not whither, and had not gone far before they found, expoſed beneath a tree, an Indian child, puny, weak, and almoſt expiring.</p>
               <p>'Behold,' cried Alogos, 'the humanity of ſava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges! this, I ſuppoſe, is parental care.

               <p>'It explains to me,' ſaid Frederick, 'what I had attributed to their manner of life and want of luxuries. It is eaſy to have none but people of ſtrength and vigour, if all that are otherwiſe be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in infancy.'</p>
               <p>'Experience,' replied Alogos, with a deep ſigh, 'is the beſt ſchool, but the miſchief is, that thoſe who are yet well, will not take warning by example, till they ſuffer themſelves.'</p>
               <p>For forty days they continued to wander, more than once encountering a few ſtraggling Indians, who attempted to convince them, that in a ſtate of nature, <hi>force</hi> was the only law, and paſſion the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtandard of right. They came at length to a great chain of mountains, extremely barren, and placed in ſuch confuſion, that they appeared ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the hand of tempeſt.</p>
               <p>They had continued their journey, merely from the reſtleſs ſpirit of rambling, and the dread they felt of returning to their delightful farm of Clarens.— They now debated whether they ſhould climb the ſummit, or take ſome other route; but the expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of beholding an entire new country, invited them to labour at the ſteep. They were by this time ſo accuſtomed to hardſhip, that a trifle could not intimidate them, and in three days they gained the elevation of the mountains.</p>
               <p>They gazed upon the proſpect beneath them, which was much ſuperior to their expectation. A
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:038973_0198_101284A3C68F7D38"/>
fine level country, interſperſed with gentle ſwellings, and interſected with limpid ſtreams, watering ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive groves, preſented itſelf. Amongſt the groves appeared high ſpires and lofty domes, evidently the workmanſhip of ingenious artiſts.</p>
               <p>The philoſophers were enraptured, and wearied themſelves in conjectures of what region they could be advanced to. They waited impatiently for the morning, when they began to unravel the mazes which wound down from the mountains, and it was the enſuing day before they reached the baſe.</p>
               <p>They then refreſhed themſelves with ſome fine fruit, which ſeemed to grow neglected, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded forward towards the great piles of buildings which they had ſeen from far. They overtook a man who was ſlowly walking, with his eyes bent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, as if in deep ſtudy, and totally nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Our philoſophers were therefore not put out of countenance by their own ragged appearance.</p>
               <p>Doctor Alogos accoſted him in various languages, but without being underſtood, when the man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in Hebrew what they were, and how they came into that country.—'Why do you walk nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?' ſaid the Doctor.</p>
               <p>'Becauſe we have nobody to make clothes.'— 'How do you employ yourſelves?'—'I am ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the public good.'</p>
               <p>'Studying the public good!' repeated the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: 'you are then a legiſlator of the country?'— 'No, I am a private individual; but it is the place of every man to ſtudy to promote the public good.'</p>
               <p>Having paſſed this politician, who ſeemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to ſpeak much, our vagabonds diſputed with themſelves, on the nature of the country, which they thought very ſtrange, eſpecially as they met
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:038973_0199_10128506A893E0E0"/>
ſeveral perſons employed ſtudying the public good. A man ſtriking a tree ſometimes with his fiſt, and then with his head, induced the Doctor to inquire the meaning of ſo ſingular an action. 'What are you doing?' ſaid the Doctor. 'I am endeavouring to drive this <hi>idea</hi> out of my path.' 'That is not an idea,' ſaid the Doctor, 'that is a reality.'—'All things are ideas,' replied the man: 'every thing which appears to exiſt, is merely an idea; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove that there is reality, body, ſubſtance, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion, or any ſuch quality.'</p>
               <p>'Very good,' ſaid the Doctor: 'I fancy before you have beat that idea, in form of a tree, out of your way, you will have an idea of a fractured ſkull.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is aſtoniſhing how ridiculous and even irrational the new doctrines appear, when taken from the page of metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſics, and contraſted with practice.</note>'</p>
               <p>As they advanced along the high road, the hedges of which were fallen into decay, they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took a troop of people, who were moving a tree by means of a machine; the greater part ſtood idle, while five or ſix furthered the work. Doctor Alo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gos inquired of the neareſt what was the name of the country. The man pauſed for ſome time, at length replied, 'I do not think it for the public good to anſwer you—I will reflect upon it.' While he ſtood reflecting, he was called by his comrades; the firſt gang or labourers retiring for another to take their places.</p>
               <p>The travellers proceeded onwards towards the great city. They perceived ſome builders repairing an houſe, which, from its ſingular conſtruction, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged their attention. While they ſtood admiring, all the labourers gave over work. A man, who was half way up a ladder, fixed his burden on an
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:038973_0200_101284A68C890BA0"/>
hook, which ſeemed there on purpoſe. Some men winding up a crane, fixed the pulley upon a catch, and left the beam hanging in the air. The whole party ſauntered away different ways, and a new ſet advancing, began to labour. The travellers reflected on this incident, remaining ſtationary for ſome time. In half an hour this new ſet of builders retired like the former, and another troop advanced.</p>
               <p>'This is a curious mode of building,' ſaid the Doctor. 'It ſeems an equal diviſion of labour,' ſaid Stupeo; 'I dare ſay we are arrived at laſt in a country of philoſophers.'</p>
               <p>'But at this rate an houſe will not be finiſhed in ten years:—the public good does not ſeem much promoted by this means.'</p>
               <p>They proceeded on, and ſaw on one ſide of the road a ſmith's ſhop. They pauſed to ſee if labour was here equally divided. Some iron in the fire was heated to a proper heat, taken out and laid upon the anvil, when the man who was working left it there and marched away. Another took his place, but the welding heat was loſt, and the iron was returned again to the fire.</p>
               <p>A man drew near them in deep thought, and the Doctor ventured to inquire the ſubject of his reflection. 'I am debating,' replied he, 'whether it will be moſt to the public good, that I ſhould help half an hour at getting in the harveſt, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour half an hour at building the new granary; I have ſpent all the morning in conſidering, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not determine.'</p>
               <p>'Then it is neceſſary to do one?'—'Yes, it has been proved in a voluminous book of political juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: that, in the old ſyſtem of things, the labour which was performed by a certain number of the lower people, could be done in half an hour's labour

               <p>'It is true,' ſaid Parecho, with a languid ſmile, 'that your greateſt ſticklers for freedom, if they ſee their folly, become as great champions for ſlavery, always in extremes. Under our former govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was a limited monarchy, we had every

               <p>'It muſt be owned,' ſaid Frederick, 'theſe people are a whimſical ſet, and do not ſeem much better for their liberty.'</p>
               <p>'This is a philoſophical republic,' ſaid Alogos; 'the ancient republics were fighting republics;— the Americans and the Hollanders are trading re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publics, but men ſeemed neither better ſatisfied, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter governed, or better fed in any of them; nor in fact, do they enjoy ſo many benefits as in a limited monarchy.'</p>

Conqueſt is at firſt the only compact, and the people, little better than an herd of murderers, directed by a chief.

Frederick, 'in as many different definitions; for my part I am diſguſted with every thing.' Theſe philoſophers were here interrupted by the ſnoring of Mungo, who had quietly laid down upon the ſtraw, untroubled with the nature of truth or metaphyſical diſquiſitions; and the three great men concluded, that ignorance was in ſome meaſure neceſſary to happineſs. The next morning, Parecho attended his gueſts to a large hall, where they found a great number of people ſitting upon benches: in the midd of the hall was a ſquare platform, railed round ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to a ſmall ſtage. There was no ornament to fix the eye, nor any muſic to catch the ear, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſilence remained.'</p>
               <p>'Why,' ſaid Alogos to Parecho, 'is the place painted black. Have you no prieſts—no muſic?'</p>
               <p>'There was once very fine paintings,' ſaid Pare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cho, 'repreſenting the miracles in Egppt and the Wilderneſs, but it was feared by the philoſophers that theſe ſymbols would recall to mind the God of their fathers, which they wiſhed to expunge from the human ſoul.—We uſed to have fine mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic; but the muſicians could not be paid, and the whole art ſell rapidily to decay, for who would or could attend to the acquirement of ſkill, when all their reward was a bare exiſtence. As to the old prieſts they were deemed to have enſlaved the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by darkening their minds with ſuperſtition, and indulging themſelves in licentiouſneſs; ſo that they were moſt of them deſtroyed, and the reſt mingled with the people.'</p>
               <p>A perſon now moved from the crowd, and mounting the ſtage, made an oration for half an hour upon morality, political juſtice, and the great book of Nature, where he aſſerted every thing was to be learnt that was worth knowing: he concluded
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:038973_0218_101284DF81406388"/>
with declaring againſt the power of revealed religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to check the crimes of men, aſſerting, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality was every thing, and the light of nature the real ſtandard of virtue.</p>
               <p>The people then waited ſome time; and no one elſe coming forward, they diſperſed to walk in the fields, the day being an holiday.</p>
               <p>Our philoſophers likewiſe quitted the city, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a diſtance the orator, who had harangued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout morality. They entered a grove of trees where they ſat down, converſing on politics. A young woman was walking in the grove, to whom the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſt advanced, and ſeemed to preſs her to ſomething ſhe objected. He was proceeding to violence, when a young man ſprung upon him; they both fell to the ground, but the orator being the ſtrongeſt, roſe, and with a long knife ſtabbed the youth to the heart, and ran away.</p>
               <p>'Horrid!' cried Doctor Alogos, 'is there no means of puniſhing the monſter?'</p>
               <p>'This man,' ſaid Parecho, indignantly, 'is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former of the people, and ſuch the conſequence of his doctrine. If you deſtroy in the minds of men the belief of an avenging and infinite Power, you give looſe to every paſſion in the corrupted heart of man. It is not poſſible to bring this wretch to juſtice, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>no individual</hi> has the power of life and death, unleſs it is done in a private manner, by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation;—beſides, it is contrary to political juſtice, that any <hi>paſt</hi> offence ſhould be puniſhed with coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion.</p>
               <p>'Very true,' ſaid Stupeo, 'that I taught the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of England. But he might be fined—no man, or body of men, can have a right to puniſh with death.'</p>
               <p>'But how will you fine a man who has no prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, and where all are equal—and what could be

done with the fine? You would ſoon deſtroy equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.'</p>
               <p>'But you might impriſon him,' ſaid Frederick, 'to prevent his doing the ſame again.'</p>
               <p>'Impoſſible,' replied Parecho.—'My dear Sir, hear the opinions of our great philoſophers. The body is perpetually changing—the ſoul of man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes every moment a different being; ſo that were we to put this man in priſon, to-morrow we ſhould be confining a totally different being wholly innocent of the crime.'</p>
               <p>'Very good,' replied Doctor Alogos, 'the faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ionable Mr. Hume has made moſt of the <hi>young</hi> men converts to theſe very doctrines in my country. So that, notwithſtanding I can recollect a friend or a wife for twenty years back, they are not the ſame perſons. I and they are changed, transformed, and renewed, nobody knows how often; and Mr. Hume, who finiſhed the eſſays, was not the Mr. Hume who wrote the treatiſe on Human Nature. So Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander the Great, who was the ſon of Philip of Macedon, was not the Alexander the Great who ſubdued Greece by his flatteries, nor him who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the Perſians.'</p>
               <p>'Such being the caſe,' ſaid Parecho, 'it is plain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there can be no puniſhments without they are corporeal, nor any corporeal puniſhment without infringing political juſtice: you cannot reſtore the injury done to ſociety by committing an outrage in the article of puniſhment.'</p>
               <p>'Then crimes may be done with impunity,' ſaid Doctor Alogos.</p>
               <p>'What a delightful country,' cried Stupeo. 'I will never quit it. The human mind is here in perfect freedom. At length, my dear Frederick, we have found the place where our principles are practicable, where truth and philoſophy ſhine with

beams of irradiating ſplendour, and the dignity of human nature is unſophiſticated in its purſuits.'</p>
               <p>'Would that I were once more in England with my dear Laura, if the children of nature have not murdered her,' ſaid the Doctor, with a deep ſigh.</p>
               <p>Frederick knew not what to think: his ſenſes frequently contradicted the profound Stupeo, and often led him to think his tutor in the wrong; but the philoſophical diſquiſitions, the grand doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of the greateſt good, and the elegant Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of Political Juſtice, inclined him again to the new philoſophy.</p>
               <p>Our vagabonds returned to the city, when they became hungry. Stupeo grumbled very much to find only coarſe bread and fruits, with clear water. 'Have you no fermented liquors,' ſaid he, 'no ſpirits?'</p>
               <p>'No,' anſwered Parecho: 'ſpirits could not be the univerſal drink, independent of the labour to procure them; they are, therefore, unallowable in a ſtate of equality. At firſt, when they were diſtributed according to every one's pleaſure, the ſtreets were filled with drunkards. Nature never deſigned men to drink liquid fire.'</p>
               <p>'At leaſt,' ſaid Frederick, 'I ſhould think ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal food would give variety to your table.'</p>
               <p>'What,' replied Parecho, 'rear animals on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to deſtroy them. Nature never tells us any ſuch thing—we uſed formerly to have excellent oxen, but ſince labour has been equally divided, no body will undertake to breed them; and the ſpecies is become almoſt extinct: beſides, no one would take the unpleaſant office of butcher, where there was no reward.'</p>
               <p>'Human life,' ſaid the Doctor, 'is not worth

               <p>'It is a falſe taſte,' ſaid Stupeo, 'which has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced animal food: and if we do indulge in it, why not eat it raw?—Nature, had ſhe intended we ſhould feed upon dreſſed diſhes, would have produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed animals ready roaſted and boiled.'</p>
               <p>'And why not,' ſaid Parecho, 'have loaves and cakes ready baked, grow upon ſtalks in the field: all this is a deviation from nature, and very abſurd in great philoſophers to follow. But ſeriouſly, what is this jargon about nature?—What is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?'</p>
               <p>'Why, nature,' anſwered Stupeo, 'is that which every man ſees with his eyes—it is viſible at firſt view to all underſtandings—it is the influence of rational principles impinging upon men, actions palpable to every comprehenſion:—It is derived from the ſingle letter N.—Take the Latin words naſcor, natus, natura, and the French né for <hi>born,</hi> analyſe them, and you will find that Aſcor being but a frequentive, Atus a common idiomatic expreſſion, Atura the ſame, é the ſame, reduces all theſe words to the ſingle letter N, which offers no ſenſe: reſtore the eliptic ſyllable <hi>ge,</hi> cut off by the uſual tendency of languages to contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to euphony, you have geN-aſcor, geN-atu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The phenomena of nature are changing—the deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of all things is at hand.'</p>
               <p>'What deſolation?' ſaid the Doctor, calmly; 'are you frightened at your own ideas? or do you think this terrene habitation will diſſolve? Do you believe in the revelations and prophecy?'</p>
               <p>'Is this a moment to talk of ſuch things,' ſaid Stupeo, 'when an inſtant may ſwallow us alive into the gulph of hell? Do you not feel the ground trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble beneath you?'</p>

               <p>At theſe words, Stupeo caſt himſelf upon the ground, which was agitated by an earthquake, and exhibited a ſcene tremendouſly grand.

               <p>'Oh! omnipotent Being,' cried Doctor Alogos, falling on his knees, 'protect us from the ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ruin — if ſuch, O Preſerver of mankind, be the conſequence of ſome trif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>'I acknowledge,' ſaid Frederick, his eye gazing upon the dun face of the heavens; 'I acknowledge there is a great and ETERNAL POWER. The phenomena of nature muſt convince us, if we are not fools, but it is eaſy in a calm region, where the ſeaſons are ſcarcely ruffled by a ſtorm, to doubt the exiſtence of a God, as men frequently doubt in their own minds, whether they ſhall die before they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at an hundred while health floats in their veins.'</p>
               <p>'It is not ſufficient,' ſaid Doctor Alogos, 'that we behold the wonders of nature, theſe can only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire our minds with the ſublime and the terrific; we muſt be taught firſt by revelation, the great truths of religion, and then ſhall we find a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in every particle of matter.'</p>

There is ſcarcely a nation or a people under the heavens who have not believed in it, though ſome of their <hi>ignorant young</hi> men have pretended to ſet it aſide, merely becauſe it did not agree with the exceſs of their paſſions.

In theſe caverns, ſafe, as they hoped, from another flood, and before they dared venture into the plains (where they built the city of Thebes) they invented the myſteries of hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phics to convey the ſacred doctrines of their religion, which, doubtleſs they received by traditions prior to the deluge<note n="*" place="bottom">Bruce's Travels.</note>. In theſe hieroglyphics the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baic beetle had principal part, and was the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of immortality for two reaſons: the firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, after the waters of the Nile ſubſide, and leave the mud behind, this inſect is the firſt which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, and is thence emblematic of the reſurrection; and the ſecond, becauſe the beetle is the longeſt liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of any inſect known, far exceeding the age of man.

               <p>'Becauſe,' anſwered Doctor Alogos, 'the human mind is charmed with novelty, and loſes ſolid reaſon in the glare of plauſible hypotheſis. It requires reflection to perceive that the philoſophers of the preſent day are ſupremely ignorant, and to cover which, they pretend to deny and diſcredit every relic of antiquity, by which they would plunge the world again into ignorance.

               <p>The face of the ſky by degrees became ſerene, and the vagabonds bent their courſe by the attitude of the ſun.

               <p>Frederick revolved in ſilence the words of Doctor Alogos—he ſhuddered at the remembrance of his former actions, and would have openly derelicted from his profeſſions, had he not been aſhamed of the reproaches of Stupeo, who perpetually declaimed againſt that imbecility of mind, which, having once

               <p>DURING many days theſe philoſophers wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the woods, till their ammunition was expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and their ſpirits exhauſted. They had no means of making a fire, and had for ſome time devoured all their game raw, to the no ſmall prejudice of a ſtate of nature—for even Stupeo himſelf allowed, that the idea of proviſions dreſſed, was better than the idea of them raw. Their bodies were worn out with fatigue and want; and they were ſo miſerable, as to deſire death as a relief.</p>
               <p>For three days they taſted nothing but water, and a few berries which grew wild. Their clothes were partly worn from their backs, and the remnants were animated with living multitudes:—a ſevere fever burnt in the veins of Frederick, and but for the ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy encouragement of the Doctor, he would have ſunk by the way;—their beards were grown to philoſophical length, and take them all in all, they appeared truly the vagabond children of nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="221" facs="unknown:038973_0232_1012850979BFF750"/>In this forlorn condition, Stupeo uttered curſes with volubility, arraigning the conduct of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, if ſuch there really were.</p>
               <p>Doctor Alogos endeavoured to inſpire him with patience, obſerving, that Providence was not to blame, as themſelves had wilfully plunged into the wilderneſs in ſearch of an <hi>ignus fatuus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When they were all nearly at the laſt exertion, they were overtaken by a tribe of Indians returning from an expedition againſt another tribe; and as they could make no defence, they became priſoners with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſtruggle. Theſe men of nature having fed them with a paſte of pounded Indian corn, tied their hands behind them, and, notwithſtanding they were every moment at the point of fainting, urged them forward in a rapid march—poor Mungo fell down and expired, with the over-exertion; but his fate did not move with <hi>falſe pity</hi> the callous boſoms of theſe children of nature.</p>
               <p>Stupeo was almoſt diſtracted at his condition, though he obſtinately inſiſted that pity was a falſe feeling of weakneſs in the human heart. Frederick now remembered that Rouſſeau had ſaid, 'That <hi>pity</hi> was a natural ſentiment, which moderates in each individual the activity of ſelf-love, concurring to the mutual preſervation of all the ſpecies. So wonderfully do great philoſophers contradict each other in the grand affair of immutable truth.</p>
               <p>On the following day they reached a little Indian village. On ſetting up the war-whoop, a number of women and children came out to meet them, with ſcreams and yells, ſurpaſſing in variety and ſublimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of tone, a chorus of an hundred cats howling by moonlight.</p>
               <p>'This is the muſic of a natural ear,' ſaid the Doctor—but Stupeo was too much abſorbed in
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:038973_0233_1012850F05BE3318"/>
his execrations, to reply. Theſe great men were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined in a little hut, and had a plentiful repaſt of bruiſed Indian wheat and water.—'After all,' ſaid Stupeo, 'theſe ſavages are better than men in civ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilized life; this hut or priſon is wholeſome and clean, we are not confined in a loathſome dungeon —the light of nature is always pure, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſimple men cannot fail to be juſt. We only become monſters when we condemn each other to eternal flames for a bug-bear, or drag each other to ſtakes for the ſake of religion. I am more than ever a ſceptic; all exiſtence is to my eyes a farce, a folly, an idea. Pain, pleaſure, life, death, every thing is an idea, or Hume muſt be wrong.'</p>
               <p>While he thus ſpoke to his ſilent companions, an hideous howl and continued roar of joy advanced towards them. It was night, and the Indians drew near, dancing in rude figures, with torches of pitch-pine, blazing in the air.</p>
               <p>'Theſe are very ſingular ideas,' ſaid the Doctor; 'if your ideas and my perceptions are alike, we ſhall have a comfortable idea of roaſting.'</p>
               <p>'I maintain,' ſaid Stupeo:—the door of the hut at that inſtant was opened, and ſeveral black chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of reaſon dragged out the miſerable philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and bore him triumphantly to a green, in the centre of the village. There they faſtened him to a ſtake, and ſticking his body full of pine-knots, ſet fire to the whole, which conſumed the miſerable wretch with the moſt agonizing tortures, while the ſons of nature danced around him, mocking his cries, and encouraging their children to dart at him little pointed arrows<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>'Alas!' cried Frederick, in extreme agitation, 'What is man? A being influenced by cruelty and rapine:—he is worſe than the ſavage hyena of the deſert, or the untamed tyger of the burning ſands. I ſee with bitter conviction, that coercion and laws are neceſſary to reſtrain the arm of deſtruction and violence: in the imperfect nature of all terrene ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtences, no law can be made to deter the wicked, without being a reſtraint, or in ſome inſtances, a grievance to ſome who are innocent.—I ſee that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, with all its drawbacks, poſſeſſes the greateſt portion of real happineſs; and that half our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries we bring on ourſelves, by endeavouring to raiſe human nature ſuperior to itſelf.'</p>
               <p>'I am afraid,' ſaid the Doctor, 'it will be our turn next. Theſe wretches are ignorant of the <hi>laws of nations</hi>; and they have not ſufficient <hi>religion</hi> to teach them the duties of man to man.'</p>
               <p>Thus theſe two vagabonds, turncoats, unworthy the great name, or glorious martyrdom of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Stupeo, who periſhed in the heat of his own ideas, bewailed the accident of a gentle roaſting.

But the Indians had no ſooner perfectly reduced the great philoſopher, metaphyſician, and politician, to the idea of a few cinders, than they advanced to the cottage, and dragged out the two priſoners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their paſtime.</p>
               <p>As they approached the ſtakes, they were buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on every ſide by ſevere blows from the delicate fiſts of the ladies, who out of ſpite at the fair ſkin of the dirty, louſy, Frederick, bit and pinched him with a very agreeable and ſportive air. Indeed, if one might judge by their cries, they were even more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted than the tender European ladies who crowd to ſee ſome poor wretches extended on a gibbet, or run ſcreaming to contemplate an houſe in flames; or, than the fair daughters of France, who danced the Carmagnole round the guillotine.</p>
               <p>While they were tying their victims to the ſtake, and dancing round with their blazing torches, the report of a gun ſtruck them with conſternation, and a loud yell beſpoke their deſpair:—a ſecond fire, which ſent a bullet whiſtling amongſt them, urged them to flight, and our heroes remained expoſed to whatever might enſue—a large fire gleamed on one ſide of them, by the light of which they perceived ſeveral perſons advancing, dreſſed in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> frocks, like American hunters.</p>
               <p>They drew near with their rifles in their hands, and ſeemed to ſtart with aſtoniſhment when they ſaw two white men naked, and covered with dirt. 'Whoever you are,' ſaid Frederick, in a doleful voice, 'have <hi>pity</hi> upon our ſituation, and releaſe us before theſe monſters return.'</p>
               <p>'Who are you?' ſaid one of the ſtrangers, whoſe hat was adorned with a feather—'Surely, I am no ſtranger to your voice.'</p>
               <p>'My name is Fredrick Fenton.'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="225" facs="unknown:038973_0236_10128517F5D989A8"/>'Frederick Fenton!' exclaimed the ſtranger; 'O! eternal Providence, what myſteries involve us finite beings?—Haſt thou brought into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of America 'the man I had moſt reaſon to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor, and made me the inſtrument of his preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Me, whom he ſo cruelly injured in the perſon of my Amelia?'</p>
               <p>'What,' cried Frederick, 'are you Vernon? Point your rifle at me, and finiſh at once the days of a miſcreant.'</p>
               <p>'No,' replied Vernon; 'it is not for me to wreſt vengeance to myſelf; but how are you in this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? <hi>Gratitude</hi> to your father makes me almoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice that I have ſaved his ſon.'</p>
               <p>'Gratitude,' ſighed Frederick. 'Ah, Vernon! had I but felt it more early; had I liſtened to the common claims of nature and of ſociety, I might have been a worthy member. But the new ſophiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticated jargon of philoſophy and impracticable liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, had rendered me inſane. I have, however, been the pupil of experience, and have ſeen the aſhes of Stupeo ſcatterred by the wind.'</p>
               <p>'I will return to ſociety,' ſaid Vernon: 'it was the loſs of a woman which embittered it to me, and drove me a forlorn wanderer in theſe woods; where I have fortunately found another to ſupply her loſt, and lead me again into the world. I fancy, Fred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erick, ſhe is not unknown to you; and if I may judge right, this is Doctor Alogos her uncle.'</p>
               <p>'Can it be,' cried the enraptured man, 'that my dear Laura yet lives—is it poſſible ſhe has eſcaped from theſe horrid ſavages?'</p>
               <p>'She now, I hope, waits us at your plantation,' replied Vernon, 'where I left her to ſearch for you, in company with theſe my friends; though I confeſs with very little expectation of finding you.'</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="226" facs="unknown:038973_0237_1012851991CC0F90"/>'Thou art too good: O Providence!' cried Alogos, ſhedding tears, 'what is man, that thou art mindful of him?'</p>
               <p>'I am glad,' ſaid Frederick:—'I feel at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more ſatisfaction than I have felt for years— ſurely, there is ſomething in virtue not be deſcribed, —you will be happy, Vernon, with Laura—ſhe is formed for you, and I rejoice that I did not ſucceed in debaſing her purity. I am tired with philoſophy; I deteſt politics; and I perceive that an <hi>equality,</hi> the moſt exact and perfect in reſpect of every moral and ſocial obligation, ſprings from <hi>inequality</hi> itſelf.'</p>
               <p>'Have you heard lately from Europe?' inquired Doctor Alogos. 'Yes,' replied Vernon: 'I have news, that in Frederick's preſent ſentiments, will increaſe his ſatisfaction. His mother yet lives; ſhe recovered with much difficulty from her wounds— but ſhe mourns with, her huſband the deviation of their ſon.'</p>
               <p>'I will fly,' cried Frederick—'I will caſt myſelf at their feet, and implore them to pardon me.'</p>
               <p>In leſs than a month, they arrived again in Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucky, where they found population increaſing with the numerous emigrations, but unhappineſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content prevailed: for though the grounds which were cultivated were productive, there was no chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel for trade—and it ſignifies nothing to a farmer, that his harveſt is plentiful, if he has no market to meet his commodities.</p>
               <p>Taxes increaſed, and every man was obliged to learn the military exerciſe, and keep in check the predatory Indians.</p>
               <p>Doctor Alogos remarked, that the people of America was equally diſſatisfied with the people of England; and ſaw clearly, that no government would be univerſally approved, which was not to the exact model and intereſt of <hi>every</hi> private individual.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="unknown:038973_0238_1012851CA2922C88"/>At Philadelphia he ſettled his accounts, and drew his money from the bank.—Laura gave her hand to Vernon; and Frederick could not but feel a wiſh, that he had ſome amiable maid to unite her deſtiny with his—and by mutual good offices, ſmooth the rugged road of life. He felt at that moment, that the endearing and tender ſmile of a modeſt woman has more real pleaſure, than the moſt wanton bland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhments of promiſcuous intercourſe.</p>
               <p>The wind favoured their return to the land of genuine liberty, where there is not <hi>one</hi> man ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure as not to poſſeſs a right, nor <hi>one</hi> man ſo high, as not to be ſubject to the laws.</p>
               <p>Where the noble and the peaſant are upon <hi>equality</hi> in the <hi>penal</hi> code, and no man can ſuffer for his crimes, but with the conſent of twelve of his equals,—a right unknown to every government heretofore exiſting— a right which checks at once the arm of power, brib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, or malice.</p>
               <p>Doctor Alogos threw himſelf upon the beach, while tears of pleaſure guſhed from his eyes.—'Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, happy ſhores,' exclaimed he, 'how few compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itive evils do you know. Unviſited by ſavage war —inſulated from a treacherous and rapacious foe— untainted by peſtilence, and at a diſtance from the climes, where earthquakes and tornados in one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſwallow up, or ſweep away the exertions of a century.—Thy lands are never parched with the beams of a torrid ſun, or gelid with the froſts of the polar circles: thou never fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thy fields never fail in their produce, and half the world brings the tributes of commerce to thy ſhores— though the <hi>ſmalleſt</hi> nation on earth in local territory, thy ſituation and the valor of thy <hi>genuine</hi> children, renders thee impregnable. Nor is there a ſpot up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

the univerſal globe, ſo favoured by Nature, and ſo bleſſed by Heaven.</p>
               <p>May then thy fair face never be blaſted by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidious attacks of ſelf-intereſted and ignorant <hi>empirics</hi>; may the mania of impracticable political dreams be diſperſed by the ſurges of thy rocky ſhores; and may thy fair daughters know, that modeſty and maternal feelings are the chief ornaments of a celeſtial mind. Experience has qualified me to judge of learning, whoſe reſearches have taught me the paucity of the human mind! taught me, that in this age of reaſon, in the eighteenth century, I may exclaim with the learned and poliſhed Socrates—'<hi>All that I know is that I know nothing.</hi>'</p>
