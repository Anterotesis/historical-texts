            <title>The opinion of one that has perused the Summer morning's conversation, concerning original sin, wrote by the Rev. Mr. Peter Clark, in two things principally: first, that he has offered that, which has rendered it impossible the doctrine of the imputation of Adam's guilt to his posterity, should be true in the sense it is held by Calvinists. Secondly, that tho' he pretends to be a friend to the Calvinistical doctrine of imputed guilt, yet he has deserted this doctrine and given it up into the hands of its enemies, as it teaches the liableness of all mankind, without exception, to the torments of hell, on account of the first sin. : To which is added, a few remarks on the recommendatory preface by five Reverend clergymen. : In a letter to a friend. : [One line from Job]</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>ACCORDING to your deſire, once and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain repeated, I now ſend you my <hi>opinion</hi> of the book entitled, <hi>A ſummer morning's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,</hi> &amp;c. The intimacy between us may endanger your being prejudiced in favour of what I ſhall write. I adviſe you therefore to read it with caution, judging of it from its intrinſic weight, if it has any, and not as it comes from one that is your tried friend.</p>
            <p>My expectations, I own, were conſiderably raiſed, when I heard, that the Rev. Mr. <hi>Clark,</hi> a Gentleman noted for piety, good ſenſe, learning and candor, as well as for <hi>Calviniſtical Orthodoxy,</hi> had undertaken to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the <hi>Winter evening's conference about original ſin,</hi> which was plauſibly wrote, and, in its manner, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, the moſt fitted, of any piece I have ſeen, to lead the common people into other ſentiments concerning the doctrine of <hi>original ſin,</hi> than <hi>thoſe</hi> they had been taught in our <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> and the <hi>Confeſſion of faith</hi> commonly received among us. I ſoon procured the anſwer to this Pamphlet upon its publication, and was eager to read it, having no ſuſpicion but that I ſhould
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:008100_0003_102E2A3D4CDAD520"/>
ſee the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> doctrine of <hi>original ſin</hi> placed in a juſt and ſtrong light, and in a manner ſo ſtriking, and, at the ſame time, ſo ſoft and candid, as to gain the lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if not the conviction, of thoſe who were in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary way of thinking: In all which reſpects to ſpeak plainly and freely, I am much diſappointed; as is the caſe with ſeveral others I have had occaſion to converſe with.</p>
            <p>I did not think, that a Gentleman ſo generally well ſpoken of for his humility, meekneſs, candor and good nature, would have wrote in language ſo evidently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokening the want of theſe excellent qualities, I mean, as to preſent exerciſe. I ſee not, that he diſcovers a more modeſt ſenſe of his own fallibility, than his anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt; or that he writes with a leſs imbittered ſpirit. 'Tis ſtrange, we can't <hi>in meekneſs inſtruct thoſe that oppoſe themſelves.</hi> This is the chriſtian manner of ſpeaking, and it is naturally ſuited to bring men to an <hi>acknowledgment of the truth.</hi> I have frequently had reaſon to profeſs myſelf convinced of the propriety and truth of that ſaying of Solomon, <hi>A ſoft anſwer turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away wrath; but grievous words ſtir up anger.</hi> I imagine this Gentleman would have more honored himſelf, as well as the cauſe he is pleading, and been more likely to <hi>convince gain-ſayers,</hi> if he had wrote more in the <hi>meekneſs of wiſdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How it may appear to others of more penetration than I am maſter of, I preſume not to ſay; but to me this Gentleman's performance is not ſo free'd from ambiguity, darkneſs, and perplexity, as might be deſired. If my ſhare of underſtanding is not below what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, there are many, who, upon reading it, muſt ſay, if they will ſpeak the real ſenſe of their minds, that it is, in ſome places, at leaſt, unintelligible to them. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:008100_0004_102E2A3FB969E428"/>
'tis very unlucky for the common people, that he has been ſo lengthy. I ſuſpect, the good ends propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by this work will, in a great meaſure, be loſt as to them. They will have neither leiſure nor patience to go thro' with it. I imagine, the tho'ts here expreſſed might, to advantage, have been communicated in one third part of the room they at preſent take up; and the converſation would then have been more univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally attended to.</p>
            <p>But theſe are comparatively ſmall things, and I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion them <hi>in tranſitu</hi> only. What I principally aim at is to let you know my <hi>opinion,</hi> with the <hi>grounds</hi> of it, in two articles. The <hi>firſt</hi> is, that this Gentleman, ſo far as I am able to judge, has unhappily ſaid that, which renders it impoſſible the doctrine of the <hi>imputation of</hi> Adam'<hi>s guilt to his poſterity</hi> ſhould be true, I mean in the full ſenſe in which it is maintained by <hi>Calviniſts.</hi> The <hi>ſecond</hi> is, that tho' he wears the appearance of a friend to the doctrine of imputed guilt, as held by <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts,</hi> yet he has deſerted this doctrine, nay, given it up, as it maintains that mankind <hi>univerſally,</hi> infants as well as others, are liable to the damnation of hell-fire, on account of <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt Sin.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe articles, you will remember, I ſay, as 'tis maintained by <hi>Calviniſts</hi>; for I have no concern with any private ſcheme this Gentleman may have of his own, that is aliene from their's. Agreably to the doctrine of <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> (which will be made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to you under the next head) <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity, as he was their covenant head, or legal repreſentative, are liable to the death he was threatned with in its full ſenſe, without abatement or mitigation, that is, as inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in it the miſeries of hell after the death of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. But 'tis, as I apprehend, impoſſible, in conſiſtency
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:008100_0005_102E2A4278C9E338"/>
with what this Gentleman has ſaid, that this ſhould be true. A few words will ſuffice to ſet this matter in an eaſy, and, as I would hope, a convincing light. This Gentleman has told us, Page 55, that by the
<q>threatning, they (our firſt-parents) were to die in the very day that he ſinned.</q>
And again, in the next Page,
<q>if there had been no redeemer appointed for fallen man, no ſatisfaction to the injured juſtice of God for that firſt tranſgreſſion, to make way for his mercy to man, we don't ſuppoſe, that <hi>Adam</hi> would have had any poſterity at all; but that he himſelf would have been cut off, and periſhed, according to the rigor of the threatning, in the very day, in which he ſinned, even as the ſinning angels were, and that everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</q>
In theſe paſſages, ſo far as my underſtanding reaches, he has rendered it impoſſible to ſupport the doctrine of the imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s guilt to his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, at leaſt in the full ſenſe in which <hi>Calviniſts</hi> maintain it, becauſe, in conſiſtency with them, it don't ſeem poſſible that he ſhould be their <hi>covenant head,</hi> or <hi>legal repreſentative,</hi> ſo as that they ſhould be liable with him to the threatned penalty. How could they, ſince by the covenant that was made with him, he was to "die the very day he ſinned," and
<q>could not have had poſterity without the appointment of a redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</q>
? Surely, if <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity could not have come into exiſtence, as he ſinned, upon the foot of the covenant God entered into with him, but there was need of the interpoſition of grace, and a ſaviour, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hereto, this covenant could not be made with him as legally acting for them. Is it poſſible, this covenant ſhould be ſo made with <hi>Adam</hi> as that his poſterity, in virtue of it, ſhould become liable to the penalty of it, when, according to the tenor of the covenant itſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:008100_0006_102E2A44093D72B0"/>
muſt, in caſe of his ſin, have eternally remained in a ſtate of nonentity? For it is to be remembered, it is not according to the tenor of this covenant, but (as this Gentleman pleads) by an after-proviſional act of grace, mitigating its rigor, and ſuſpending the operation of its penalty, that it became poſſible for them to be brought into being. It muſt be a ſtrange ſort of covenant, which is ſo conſtituted as to make perſons legally liable to a certain penalty, when, at the ſame time, 'tis not poſſible it ſhould be inflicted on them, but by the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of a poſterior act of grace to bring them into exiſtence that they might be the capable ſubjects of ſuffering it! To ſay, that <hi>Adam</hi> ſo repreſented his poſterity as that they became legally ſubjected to the penalty threatned in the covenant made with him; and to ſay, at the ſame time, that he never could have had poſterity in caſe he ſinned, as in fact he did, but by an after proviſion of grace, is, as far as I am able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, ſo evident an inconſiſtency, that no intermediate ideas can make it more clearly ſo, than it at once ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be upon the bare propoſal of it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> article concerning which I would give my opinion is, that this Gentleman, tho' he wears the appearance of a friend to the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> doctrine of the imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s guilt to his poſterity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet has deſerted this doctrine, nay, given it up, as it teaches that they are univerſally liable, on account of his ſin, to the torments of hell for ever; which, by the way, is the principal ſenſe, in which it is oppoſed by <hi>Arminians,</hi> and, as I think, by the perſon he has been pleaſed to write againſt.</p>
            <p>You will be fully let into the reaſons, upon which I have taken up this opinion, and prepared to judge of the validity of them, if I make two things clear to you.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:008100_0007_102E2A484C9AE5F0"/>
1ſt. That the <hi>whole</hi> race of <hi>Adam, all</hi> his poſterity, according to the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> ſcheme, ſo ſinned in him, and fell with him, or, in other words, are ſo chargeable with his guilt, have it ſo imputed to them, as that they are, on that account, liable to, and deſerving of, eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal damnation, the pains of hell-fire for ever; that it would be conſiſtent with the juſtice and mercy of God eternally to damn them all; and that, if any of them are not thus damned, it is owing to nothing but grace, which grace might not have been ſhowed to any of them. And 2dly. That this Gentleman has not only with caution avoided to aſſert, or vindicate, the doctrine of imputation in <hi>this ſenſe,</hi> but has really given it up into the hands of it's enemies.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. In proof of the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe particulars, I might eaſily bring teſtimonies from all the approved, noted, <hi>Calvaniſtical</hi> writers of bodies of divinity; I might cite a cloud of witneſſes from among the moſt famous <hi>orthodox</hi> writers of ſermons and tracts, both in <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New-England</hi>; I might place before your view extracts from the <hi>Confeſſions of Faith,</hi> as aſſented to by moſt of the <hi>Proteſtant reformed Churches:</hi> — But this would carry me too great a length; nor is there any need of ſo much labour: As it happens, I can ſupport the preſent fact by a ſingle evidence, that is ſo circumſtanced as to be, at once, the evidence of the <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Meſſengers</hi> of the <hi>Churches of this Province,</hi> and of a great number of the moſt celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>orthodox</hi> divines in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> nation.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Weſtminſter Confeſſion of Faith</hi> was, under the ſolemnity of an oath, drawn up, and ſubſcribed by <hi>one Hundred and ſix</hi> of as noted and <hi>orthodox</hi> divines as could be collected together from all parts of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> And, as this <hi>confeſſion of faith</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed

the <hi>doctrinal</hi> ſentiments of the <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Meſſengers</hi> of the <hi>Maſſachuſett's</hi> churches, ſynodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally convened, Anno 1648, at the call of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they unanimouſly tho't fit to profeſs their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty aſſent and atteſtation to it, excepting ſome ſections which relate to points of controverſie in church diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. So that what is bro't, in a way of evidence, from <hi>this confeſſion,</hi> may fairly be looked upon as the joint teſtimony not only of more than <hi>an hundred Engliſh Calviniſtical Divines,</hi> but of <hi>all the Churches of this Province.</hi> And the ſame may be ſaid of the <hi>longer and ſhorter Catechiſms,</hi> which were compiled, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and recommended by this famous <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> and have been generally taught our children from the beginning of the country to this day.</p>
            <p>Be pleaſed now to attend to the evidence I ſhall bring from this <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> and theſe <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſms.</hi>

            <p>Says the former, I.
<q>Our firſt parents, being ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the ſubtilty and temptation of Satan, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in eating the forbidden fruit.—II. By this ſin, they fell from their original righteouſneſs and communion with God, and ſo became dead in ſin, and wholly defiled in all the faculties and parts of ſoul and body.—III. They being the root of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, <hi>the guilt of this ſin was imputed,</hi> and the ſame death in ſin and corrupted nature convey'd, to <hi>all</hi> their poſterity, deſcending from them by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary generation.—IV. From this original corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—proceed all actual tranſgreſſions.—VI. <hi>Every ſin,</hi> both <hi>original,</hi> and actual, being a tranſgreſſion of the righteous law of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and contrary thereto, doth, in its own nature, bring <hi>guilt</hi> upon the ſinner, whereby he is <hi>bound over to the wrath of God, and curſe of

            <p>In the <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> the evidence runs thus. <hi>Longer Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſm.</hi>

<q>
                  <hi>A.</hi> The venant being made with <hi>Adam</hi> as a public perſon, not for himſelf only, but for <hi>his poſterity,</hi> ALL mankind, deſcending from him by ordinary genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſinned in him, and fell with him, in that firſt tranſgreſſion. <hi>Q.</hi> Into what eſtate did the fall bring mankind? <hi>A.</hi> The fall bro't mankind into an eſtate of ſin and miſery. <hi>Q.</hi> What miſery did the fall bring upon mankind? <hi>A.</hi> The fall bro't upon mankind the loſs of communion with God, his diſpleaſure and curſe, ſo that they are by <hi>nature</hi> children of wrath, bond-ſlaves to ſatan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and JUST<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY LIABLE <hi>to all puniſhments in this world, and that which is to come.

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008100_0010_102E2A4FFB086570"/>
order to ſhew you, that the above evidence is direct and full to the point in hand. If you will only truſt your own eyes, you muſt be convinced, that according to <hi>this Confeſſion,</hi> and <hi>theſe Catechiſms.</hi> THE WHOLE POSTERITY OF ADAM, all the deſcendants from him in the ordinary way, without exception or limitation, ſo ſinned in him, had his guilt ſo imputed to them, as that, upon the account of <hi>this</hi> ſin and guilt, they are <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> liable not only to temporal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but <hi>eternal</hi> death; not only to miſeries in this life, but to <hi>never-ceaſing torments in hell:</hi> And that they would all, in fact, have ſuffered theſe <hi>eternal pains in hell</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if the grace of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thro' a redeemer, had not rendered it poſſible they ſhould eſcape them: which grace, being perfectly free and undeſerved, might have been with-held, and the whole human race, <hi>Adam</hi> with all his poſterity, left to periſh <hi>everlaſtingly in hell-fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, moſt certainly, is the true real <hi>Calviniſtical orthodox</hi> doctrine of original ſin, as it reſpects the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of guilt: Nor can it be denied with a better grace, than that the ſun ſhines at noon day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tho' it may be diſguiſed, or kept out of ſight, if any valuable ends are to be anſwered thereby.</p>
            <p n="2">2ndly, It remains now to ſatisfy you, that this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman has really deſerted the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> doctrine in the above ſenſe, yea, given it up into the hands of its enemies, yea, into the hands of the very author he is anſwering. This may ſeem ſtrange; eſpecially as he was a volunteer in writing againſt one that had attacked the <hi>Orthodox</hi> doctrine in this ſenſe, and ſet it in an odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous light. But however ſtrange it may appear, it will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I believe, upon examination, be found to be the real truth.</p>
            <p>The queſtion, ſtated by his Antagoniſt to be diſcuſſed
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:008100_0011_102E2A526AC4D270"/>
was this,
<q>Whether we, and all <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity, are charged by God with this firſt ſin of his ſo as that men, women and children are expoſed, by this alone, to the eternal damnation of hell</q>?
Whether this queſtion is ſtated fairly, or unfairly, a thorough friend to <hi>Calviniſm</hi> would, one would think, have taken oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion from it to aſſert the liableneſs of all <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, infants as well as others, to the <hi>eternal damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of hell,</hi> viewed as children of <hi>Adam,</hi> and under the imputation of his ſin and guilt; and to labour in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conſiſtency of this doctrine with the perfections of God: But inſtead of aſſerting, or vindicating, this <hi>orthodox</hi> doctrine, this Gentleman ſo ſpeaks upon it as really to give it up.</p>
            <p>His finding fault with the ſtate of the queſtion looks this way. If it had been ſtated thus, "Whether all that have deſcended from <hi>Adam</hi> by ordinary generation are liable on account of every ſin, both <hi>original</hi> and actual, to the pains of hell forever"; he could not have ſaid it was unfairly ſtated, without directly flying in the face of the <hi>Weſtminſter aſſembly,</hi> becauſe the <hi>orthodox Calviniſtical</hi> doctrine upon this head is expreſſed in their very words, no otherwiſe changed then by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them into the form of a queſtion. And what is the difference, in real ſenſe, between the queſtion as ſtated by his <hi>Antagoniſt,</hi> and thus ſtated from the <hi>Weſtminſter-aſſembly?</hi> Are the words, "all <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity, men women and children," more extenſive in their meaning, than "all that have deſcended from <hi>Adam</hi> by ordinary generation"? Surely, he will not ſay this. Are the words, "expoſed to the eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of hell," ſtronger than theſe, "liable to the pains of hell forever"? Neither will he pretend this. If therefore there is any unfairneſs in the ſtate of the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008100_0012_102E2A5450362968"/>
queſtion, it muſt be in theſe words, "by his ſin alone"; but do theſe carry a different ſenſe from thoſe, "every ſin both ORIGINAL and actual"? The truth is, the queſtion is ſtated according to the preciſe meaning of the <hi>orthodox</hi> doctrine; and it looks as tho' this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman did not care to enter upon a vindication of it, as he thus finds fault with the queſtion to be debated.</p>
            <p>But this will more fully appear by what he goes on to ſay. Tho' he owns, pag. 7. "the imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſin to his poſterity, men, women and children"; yet, in the very next words, he denies this imputation in the full <hi>orthodox Calviniſtical</hi> ſenſe. For he ſays,
<q>Infants may be, and are, ſubject to the penal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the firſt tranſgreſſion, viz. corruption of nature, pain, ſickneſs and death; in reſpect whereof it may be truly ſaid to be imputed to them, ſhould they not be thereby <hi>ſubject to eternal damnation.</hi>
               </q>
Compare this with the foregoing quotations, and judge, whether it agrees with the doctrine of <hi>Calviniſm.</hi> The doctrine of this Gentleman is, that ſome of <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity, namely infants, may not be ſubject to <hi>eternal damnation,</hi> tho' they may be ſubject to the <hi>penal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences</hi> of his ſin. The <hi>orthodox</hi> doctrine is, that the penal conſequence of the firſt tranſgreſſion is death <hi>eternal</hi> as well as temporal, the <hi>torments of hell-fire</hi> as well as the miſeries of the preſent world; and that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, unleſs they are not deſcended from <hi>Adam,</hi> have his guilt ſo imputed to them as to be ſubject to all this puniſhment. In ſhort, according to the doctrine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the country, as that which is <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and <hi>Calviniſtical,</hi>" Every ſin, original as well as actual, deſerves God's wrath and curſe, both in this life, and that which is to come"; and conſequently, infants, if they are at all chargeable with original ſin, are, in that
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008100_0013_102E2A55DBFDCD50"/>
view of their caſe, liable to the <hi>eternal damnation of hell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the next page, he is ſo far from ſtanding up in defence of the <hi>Calvinian</hi> cauſe, even in the ſenſe in which it was principally oppoſed by his Antagoniſt, that he inſinuates as tho' <hi>eternal death,</hi> meaning thereby, an eternal privation of life, not including the <hi>torments of hell,</hi> was the moſt any ſuppoſe infants liable to. His words are theſe,
<q>A thing [infants actually ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the torments of hell-fire] which few, or none maintain; even tho' <hi>ſome</hi> may ſuppoſe them liable to eternal death, that is, an eternal privation of life; as they may be, and yet not ſuffer the <hi>torments of hell.</hi>
               </q>
He is egregiouſly miſtaken in the firſt part of this ſentence, as I ſhall preſently have occaſion to ſhew you. But, in the latter, he has, to me unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, ſubſtituted the private opinion of ſuch men as Mr. <hi>Lock,</hi> and <hi>Taylor,</hi> in the room of the univerſally known tenet of <hi>Calviniſm.</hi> What thoro' <hi>Calviniſt</hi> ever underſtood, by eternal death, <hi>meerly</hi> an eternal privation of life? I will be bold to affirm, that no one, who had not departed from the principles of <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> can be mentioned that explains this eternal death in any other ſenſe, than including the <hi>torments of hell-fire.</hi> To be ſure, this is the ſenſe in which it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in our <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> and <hi>Confeſſion of faith;</hi> inſomuch that the very children are acquainted with the diſtinction of death into temporal, ſpiritual, and <hi>eternal,</hi> meaning thereby <hi>eternal damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Gentleman has been more free ſtill with the <hi>orthodox Calviniſtical</hi> principle, upon the point under conſideration. For he ſays plainly, in his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal note, page 8.
<q>I could wiſh, that the latter part of the anſwer to the 19th queſtion of the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly's
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008100_0014_102E2A5927B91910"/>
ſhorter Catechiſm</hi> might be explained, ſo as not to include thoſe who die in <hi>infancy</hi>; but to be underſtood of thoſe only of <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity, who, by indulging their natural corruption, in actual tranſgreſſions, render themſelves liable to the <hi>eternal pains of hell,</hi> as the utmoſt degree of miſery conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent on the apoſtacy.</q>
Being <hi>made liable to the pains of hell for ever</hi> is the part of this anſwer he wiſhes might be explained ſo as not to include "thoſe who die in <hi>infancy.</hi>" If he means by this wiſh, that he would have this anſwer ſo interpreted, as that people may be taught that there may be <hi>Elect</hi> infants as well as others, and that theſe may, of the meer good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and free grace of God, thro' a redeemer, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered <hi>from hell torments;</hi> this, I ſuppoſe, is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation that is generally given this anſwer by well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed <hi>Calviniſts;</hi> and there was no need of any wiſh in the caſe. But, if he means, as I conclude he does, from what has been already offered, that he would have this anſwer ſo explained, as that thoſe who die in <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy</hi> are not in the number of <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity who deſerve the <hi>pains of hell-fire,</hi> and are juſtly liable to them, and might juſtly have them inflicted upon them, as being chargeable with his guilt; I ſay, if he means this, he wiſhes, in reality of ſenſe, that one main part of the <hi>orthodox</hi> doctrine may be explained away; that people, inſtead of being inſtructed in one of the great principles of <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> may have it kept out of their ſight, or ſomething elſe ſubſtituted in its room. And theſe words in the <hi>ſhorter Catechiſm</hi> are not the only ones he muſt wiſh to be explained in a ſenſe they don't contain, but a good many others in the <hi>longer Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm,</hi> and <hi>Confeſſion of faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this ſame 8th pag. he affirms very peremptorily,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008100_0015_102E2A5C83710AE0"/>
that "we have no reaſon to conclude they [infants] ſuffer the eternal torments of hell"; which affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo ſtrongly expreſſed, is the more ſtrange, as he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduces it, with what is previous to it, with this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, "<hi>Secret things belong to God, but things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed belong to us, and to our children.</hi>" 'Tis not a ſecret thing, in the opinion of <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> that infants, as well as others, are juſtly liable, viewed as the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of <hi>Adam,</hi> to the damnation of hell. That all <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity, upon the account of original ſin, are liable to the pains of hell forever, is, with them, one of the <hi>things God has revealed to us, and to our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi> Says the great <hi>Calvin,</hi> as I have met with the quotation, "Cunctos mortales in unius hominis per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonâ morti eternae mancipatos fuiſſe, ſcriptura clamat." —That is, "that all mortals are held under the guilt of eternal death in the perſon of one man, is the loud voice of ſcripture." And in this there is an univerſal agreement among <hi>Calviniſts.</hi> But whether God, it being a matter of meer good pleaſure, will, thro' a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, deliver all infants from that eternal damnation, they deſerve, and are liable to, is the <hi>ſecret thing</hi> with <hi>Calviniſts.</hi> I don't know of one thoro' <hi>Calviniſt,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this Gentleman, that ſays in the peremptory man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner he does, "we have no reaſon to conclude they will ſuffer the eternal torments of hell." The contrary is rather their opinion, that is, that ſome of them, at leaſt, will in fact ſuffer <hi>eternal damnation</hi>; as will be made evident to you by and bye.</p>
            <p>Not that I blame this Gentleman for hoping the beſt concerning the future ſtate of <hi>infants:</hi> Nor do I find any fault with him, I rather think the better of him, for not ſaying, with <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> that the firſt ſin is ſo imputed to them, as that they are liable to the damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008100_0016_102E2A5E5F2F2B68"/>
of hell, and might juſtly have it inflicted on them, if he don't believe it. But, if he is not <hi>orthodox</hi> in this point, 'tis to me a wonderful thing, that he ſhould undertake to write againſt <hi>the Winter Evening's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation;</hi> as the <hi>principal,</hi> if not the only, deſign of that book was to attack the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> doctrine upon this article in <hi>ſpecial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſhort, from what has been already offered, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out troubling myſelf, or you, with any more citations, you will, I think, be fairly led to apprehend, that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the notion this Gentleman entertains of the imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s guilt to his poſterity, they are not, <hi>meerly</hi> or <hi>ſolely,</hi> on this account, ſubject to that <hi>eternal damnation in hell,</hi> with which his ſin was threatned; which, I am ſure, is not the doctrine of <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> but directly contradictory to it. For which reaſon, a conſiderable part of his book is no vindication of the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> doctrine in this point, nor anſwer to the author he wrote againſt, as this was the <hi>ſpecial</hi> point of <hi>Calviniſm</hi> which he attacked. And, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me, this Gentleman, no more than his Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt, is a friend to the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> doctrine, as it maintains <hi>the liableneſs of all</hi> Adam'<hi>s poſterity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, on account of his firſt ſin, to the eternal damnation of hell;</hi> which was the very thing propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by that writer to be debated.</p>
            <p>As I obſerved at firſt, this Gentleman's book was, to my apprehenſion, in ſome parts, ambiguous and dark, however clear it might be to others of deeper penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For which reaſon, 'tis poſſible I may have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken his ſentiments. If this ſhould be the truth, this letter may be a kindneſs to him, as I know you intend to make it public. Others, I have converſed with, if I am miſtaken, are miſtaken alſo. And he will now
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:008100_0017_102E2A5FEBEC7220"/>
have an opportunity, if he believes the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> doctrine of the imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s guilt to all his poſterity in the ſenſe of our <hi>Catechiſms</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter confeſſion of faith,</hi> more explicitly to ſay ſo; and to ſupply an eſſential defect in his book, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an anſwer to <hi>the Winter Evening's Converſation,</hi> I mean the want of a particular and full vindication of this doctrine, as maintained in theſe <hi>Catechiſms</hi> and <hi>Confeſſion of faith,</hi> againſt the charge of its being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the juſtice and mercy of God.</p>
            <p>Nor is the good hope he has of the ſalvation of all that die in <hi>infancy</hi> any objection againſt this, if he is a ſound and thoro' <hi>Calviniſt.</hi> For their being <hi>eventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> ſaved, or damned, will make no alteration, logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſpeaking, in the force of the arguments either to prove, or diſprove, the conſiſtency of the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> doctrine with the perfections of God. Even upon the ſuppoſition that all that die in infancy are ſaved, this doctrine cannot be true, to me it ſeems impoſſible it ſhould be true, if it was not conſiſtent with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God everlaſtingly to have damned them all. For the doctrine is, that they deſerve damnation; that they are liable to it, as chargeable with the guilt of the firſt tranſgreſſion; and that, if they are not <hi>eventually</hi> damned, it is owing to the meer good pleaſure, and free grace of God, which might not have been diſpenſed towards them. But theſe cannot be truths, if in the previous reaſon of things, it would have been inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the juſtice and other perfections of God, to have eternally damned them. The ſuppoſing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that all that die in infancy are ſaved is no vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> doctrine upon the head under debate. In true reaſon, ſeperate from paſſion, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and imagination, the objected difficulties are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008100_0018_102E2A6268F6ADD8"/>
the ſame, as if it be ſuppoſed that they are <hi>even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually</hi> damned. I could therefore wiſh this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, notwithſtanding his hoping ſo well of thoſe who die in infancy, had gone particularly and largely into a reconciliation of the <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> doctrine, as oppoſed by his Antagoniſt, with the perfections of God. There is yet opportunity; and he may hereby greatly ſerve the cauſe of <hi>orthodoxy,</hi> by removing away the greateſt ſtumbling-block in the way of its being embraced.</p>
            <p>It would, it may be, be a diſappointment to you, if I ſhould ſay nothing of the <hi>recommendatory preface,</hi> with which the book I have given you my opinion of, is uſhered into the world. I profeſs an eſteem for the Reverend Clergymen who have ſigned it; tho' I can't ſay, that I think they are infallible. They have given proof, that they are capable of being miſtaken, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopting a miſtake of the reverend author whoſe work they praiſe. <hi>He</hi> had ſaid, pag. 8, that "few or none maintain that infants ſuffer the torments of hell-fire." <hi>They</hi> ſay, the <hi>Winter Evening's Converſation</hi>
               <q>makes tragical exclamations againſt the doctrine of <hi>original</hi> ſin, commonly received in the churches of the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as if it <hi>imply'd,</hi> that children dying in <hi>infancy</hi> ſuffer the <hi>eternal torments of hell</hi> for the firſt ſin of <hi>Adam;</hi> — when it is well known, the Patrons of that doctrine are wont to leave the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate of <hi>ſuch</hi> among the ſecret things which belong to God alone.</q>
This, tho' the aſſertion of a celebrated author, and five venerable atteſtators<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I muſt be ſo free as to call a miſtake, and a very great one.</p>
            <p>I may juſtly conclude, that theſe Gentlemen will look upon <hi>Calvin</hi> as a <hi>Patron</hi> of the <hi>orthodox</hi> doctrine
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008100_0019_102E2A670665FC38"/>
concerning original ſin. Hear what he ſays. In his commentary on <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17, having obſerved, that there were two differences between Chriſt and <hi>Adam,</hi> and having deſcribed the firſt, he goes on,
<q>The other is, that the benefit by Chriſt does not come to all men, as <hi>Adam</hi> involved his whole kind in <hi>damnation.</hi> And the reaſon is in readineſs; for ſince the curſe we draw from <hi>Adam</hi> is derived to us by nature, it is not to be wondered, if it embraces the whole maſs: But that we may participate of the grace of Chriſt, it is needful we ſhould be united to him by faith. Therefore that you may poſſeſs the miſerable inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of ſin, it is enough that you are a man; for it reſides in fleſh and blood. That you may enjoy the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, it is neceſſary to be a man endowed with faith, becauſe fellowſhip with him is obtained by faith. This is communicated to <hi>infants</hi> in a peculiar way; for they have in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant the right of adoption, by which they paſs into the communion of Chriſt. I ſpeak concerning the <hi>children of the pious to whom the promiſe of grace is made:</hi> FOR OTHERS [à communi ſorte nequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam eximuntur] ARE BY NO MEANS EXEMPTED FROM THE COMMON LOT</q>;
that is, as he had ſaid before, from the <hi>damnation</hi> Adam had involved his whole kind in. And that he includes in their damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the torments of hell cannot well be doubted, as, in the quotation from him a few pages back, he prefixes the Epithet <hi>eternal</hi> to this damnation. But to prevent all diſpute upon this matter, I will cite another paſſage from him. 'Tis in theſe words of the 3d book and the 23d chapter of his inſtitutions,
<q>I aſk, from whence it is, that the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> hath involved ſo many nations together with their <hi>infant</hi> children in <hi>eternal
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008100_0020_102E2A6893434A28"/>
death</hi> without remedy, unleſs becauſe it ſo ſeemed good in God's ſight</q>?</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> who is characteriſed by the author theſe Gentlemen recommend, pag. 99, as one that "has been had in high eſteem, by the univerſal church, as an eminent inſtrument, whom God raiſed up to maintain and vindicate the doctrine of grace againſt <hi>Pelagius,</hi> and other <hi>Hereticks</hi>";—This unexceptio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable father, in Lib. I. de per. mer. et remiſ. e<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>p. 16, expreſly ſays, "Infants, dying without baptiſm, will ſuffer of all perſons the mildeſt damnation." You ſee he directly affirms their <hi>damnation,</hi> tho' he ſpeaks of it as the mildeſt; as indeed he ought to do.</p>
            <p>It will not be queſtioned, whether the famous <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur Hilderſham</hi> was a Patron of <hi>Calviniſm;</hi> and he ſays on <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51, Lect. 55,
<q>It is clear, God has declared his anger againſt the ſins of infants, not only by purſuing their <hi>ſins</hi> with hatred, but their <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;</hi> not by inflicting upon them temporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments only, but by caſting them into hell.</q>
And in the following page, he calls it
<q>a damnable error, that all that die in infancy obtain the heavenly inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance.</q>
On the contrary, he ſays, that
<q>many infants have been [Vaſa irae, et titiones inferni] veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of wrath and fire-brands of hell.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But, as it would too much increaſe the length of this letter, to inſert all the teſtimonies, upon this head, that might be collected from particular perſons, I ſhall do here, as I did before, that is, give you in one view the evidence of <hi>an hundred and ſix</hi> eminent Patrons of the doctrine of original ſin, as received in the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of the reformation, and this as ſubſcribed to by the <hi>Elders</hi> and <hi>Meſſengers</hi> of the churches of <hi>this province,</hi> Anno 1648. 'Tis contained in thoſe words
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008100_0021_102E2A6A1F4D4288"/>
of the 3d article of the 10th chap. of the <hi>Weſtminſter Aſſembly's confeſſion of faith;</hi>
               <q>
                  <hi>Elect infants,</hi> dying in infancy, are regenerated and ſaved by Chriſt, thro' the Spirit, who worketh when, and where, and how he pleaſeth.</q>
The phraſe <hi>Elect infants,</hi> eſſentially includes in it the idea of ſome who are <hi>left.</hi> If there are <hi>elect infants,</hi> then there are <hi>reprobate infants.</hi> There can't be ſome <hi>choſen,</hi> unleſs others are <hi>paſſed by.</hi> And whoever are <hi>paſſed by,</hi> are neither "redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor juſtified, nor ſanctified, nor ſaved by Chriſt"; as in the 2d article of the 3d chap: The unavoidable conſequence of which is, that they muſt <hi>periſh eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally,</hi> as they are not delivered out of the ſtate the fall had bro't them into, which was a ſtate that expoſed them to the <hi>torments of hell-fire forever;</hi> as has been ſhewn to be the doctrine of this confeſſion.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add here, as 'tis one of the known principles of <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> that all <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity, who are not <hi>choſen in Chriſt before all worlds to eternal life,</hi> will eventually ſuffer the torments of hell; 'tis certain if there are <hi>non-elect</hi> infants, they muſt ſuffer theſe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And will theſe Gentlemen ſay, 'tis the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſtical</hi> doctrine, that <hi>all infants are elected to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life!</hi> I will publickly own I am miſtaken, if they can produce ſo much as one <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> writer, of any conſiderable note, who has ventured to ſay ſo. Nay, 'tis not the opinion of all <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> that all the children, even of the pious and faithful, that die in infancy, are among the <hi>elect</hi> that will be ſaved. Such learned and celebrated <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> as <hi>Paroeus, Zanchy, Perkins,</hi> and <hi>Donteklok,</hi> as I find it expreſſed by a great author, directly aſſert,
<q>that <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation</hi> take place among the children of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, inſomuch that ſome of their children that die in infancy are precipitated into hell.</q>

            <p>I am ready to think, it appears pretty plain to you by this time, that theſe Gentlemen were miſtaken. Whether they will entertain this apprehenſion of the matter, I know not; but this I am well ſatisfied of, that they will not be free to declare, "that they are deeply concerned to find the ſcripture-doctrine of orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal ſin miſ-repreſented and derided," by the laſt quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted author. And if not, why ſhould they ſay this of the author of the <hi>Winter Evening's Converſation</hi> for
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008100_0025_102E2A74C19D6420"/>
conſidering infants, in the courſe of his arguments, as ſuffering in the fire of hell?</p>
            <p>But ſhould it be even ſuppoſed, that theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were not miſtaken in the fact we have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, is it not very extraordinary, when they had ſo fair an occaſion to give their atteſtation to the known <hi>orthodox</hi> doctrine, that infants, as well as others, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the damnation of hell, and are juſtly liable to it, as chargeable with the guilt of the firſt ſin; I ſay, is it not ſtrange, that they ſhould omit dropping a word inſinuating the truth of this great <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> point: Eſpecially, as they took care to give their readers to underſtand, that the <hi>orthodox</hi> doctrine did not ſo much as "IMPLY that children dying in infancy ſuffered the torments of hell for this firſt ſin." May not weak well-minded people be in danger of being hereby tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned aſide from what they eſteem the truth of ſcripture? If I am not miſinformed, ſome of theſe Gentlemen have found fault with others, and rebuked them too, for withholding the truth, when they had a fair occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſpeak to it. And the occaſion here loudly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon them to ſpeak; for if they were at the pains carefully to read the book they recommended, before they ſigned the preface to it, 'tis difficult to conceive how they could avoid ſeeing, that the true <hi>Calviniſtical</hi> doctrine, as it reſpects the liableneſs of all <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity to the torments of hell, on account of his ſin, was rather oppoſed than aſſerted, or vindicated. And yet, they leave this important point altogether untoucht, or rather ſo ſpeak upon infants not ſuffering the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of hell, as to endanger people's being led to think they were not liable to them, in any view what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. I can't but eſteem this a great omiſſion in ſuch Gentlemen.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more that has given me ſome ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:008100_0026_102E2A772D5D0980"/>
It is this. They
<q>;ſolemnly adviſe and entreat the churches, whenever vacant, to beware of ſettling any man in the paſtoral office, who does not profeſs a firm belief of the great doctrine here defended, and the other important articles of our holy religion dependent on it, or connected with it.</q>
A man may firmly believe the doctrine here defended, and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther articles connected with it, and not believe with our <hi>Catechiſms,</hi> and the <hi>Weſtminſter confeſſion of faith,</hi> that all <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity are liable to the damnation of hell, as chargeable with the guilt of his firſt ſin: And yet, in conſiſtency with the ſolemn advice of theſe Gentlemen, any vacant church might ſettle him in the paſtoral office over them. What will a late venerable <hi>orthodox</hi> Council ſay to this, who ſolemnly adviſed one of our churches to diſmiſs their paſtor, as unfit to be any longer their paſtor, if not upon this charge only, upon this as a principal one, namely,
<q>that he did not think it conſiſtent with the juſtice and mercy of God eternally to damn any of <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity, MEERLY upon the account of his firſt ſin.</q>
Surely, if a man may be ſettled in the paſtoral office, tho' he don't be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Adam</hi>'s poſterity are liable to the torments of hell, <hi>meerly</hi> on account of his firſt ſin, it ought to be no reaſonable objection againſt his being continued in it, that he can't ſee the conſiſtency of this doctrine with the juſtice and mercy of God.—But I ſhall leave that Council, and theſe Gentlemen, to ſettle this point between themſelves.</p>
            <p>I have now given you my opinion, with the grounds of it; and might eaſily have enlarged this letter into the bulk of a book of 156 pages, but that I tho't it beſt not to be lengthy. Judge for yourſelf, and do it impartially.</p>
