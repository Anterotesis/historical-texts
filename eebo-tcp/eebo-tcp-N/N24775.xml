            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Do you know Richard Parker, the Priſoner?—<hi>A.</hi> I do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did the priſoner belong to the Sandwich?—<hi>A.</hi> He did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What ſtation was he in?—<hi>A.</hi> I do not know what capacity he was in.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Repeat what you know of the priſoner's being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in a mutiny on board the Sandwich, and of any ſuſpected conduct either on board or on ſhore, on or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the 12th of May, or of any inſtances of diſreſpectful language or conduct to his officers during the time this mutiny exiſted? <hi>A.</hi> The firſt time I obſerved any thing particular in the Priſoner's conduct, (further than pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rading about with a vaſt number of people on ſhore, with a red flag) was, on or about the 20th of May, when I went on board the Sandwich, for the purpoſe of making known to that ſhip and other's his Majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's proclamation of pardon, on their returning to their duty, on the terms granted to their brethren at Spit-head, which the Delegates, (among whom was Parker) had previouſly aſſured me they would be ſatisfied with. On my going on board with my flag in a boat, there was no reſpect ſhewn me whatever. The officers were then without their ſide arms, and had no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the ſhip. Unwilling to return on ſhore till an opportunity offered for my ſpeaking to the people, I waited for a conſiderable time, when Parker, with others, came on the quarter-deck and ſaid, that none
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032837_0004_0FF554D2E7117318"/>
others but themſelves, (meaning, I preſume, the ſhip's company) ſhould be preſent. The priſoner then ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered me a paper, containing what he and others called a liſt of grievances, ſaying, at the ſame time, until thoſe were redreſſed, they would not give up the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that was then in their hands. They inſiſted alſo on having it ratified by the Admiralty. Finding my ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to reſtore order were of no avail, I went on ſhore. On the 22d, certain troops arrived at Sheerneſs. On the 23d, my flag was ſtruck on board the Sandwich. On the evening of that day, I was at the Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's houſe, and while I was
inquiring into complaints alledged againſt two marines, that were brought in by a party of the Military, the Priſoner, and a man whom they called Davis, with three or four others, I believe, came abruptly into the houſe, and demanded why thoſe men were in cuſtody, telling me at the ſame time, that my flag was ſtruck—that I had no authority, and that the power was in their hands. They then took the men away, as they ſaid, to trial. An expreſſion made uſe of by Parker was, that he was not to be intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated. About the 4th of June, I received a letter from Parker, ſtating him as Preſident of the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of Delegates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did you receive it from Parker?—<hi>A.</hi> It was ſigned with his name: that letter ſtated, that Admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration had acted improperly in ſtopping the proviſions allowed the men, and that the fooliſh Proclamation was calculated to enflame the minds of honeſt men.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What Proclamation?—<hi>A.</hi> The King's Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, it could be no other, he did not ſay that; but he meant it. I have given you the detail, and have nothing more particular to relate—I have had frequent conferences with the Priſoner, and many others of them, and talked to them, in order to bring them to a ſenſe of their miſconduct, without any good effect; he in general took the lead as the ſpokeſman, with a degree of inſolence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was there always a degree of inſolence?—<hi>A.</hi> Not always, ſometimes there was. He appealed to the reſt, whether he was not authoriſed to ſpeak the ſenſe of the whole, and if it was their wiſh it ſhould be ſo;
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032837_0005_0FF554D472F9F510"/>
And even prevented one man in particular, whoſe name I do not know, from anſwering a queſtion I had put to him, he prevented him with threats: he turned round and ſaid to him, at the ſame time. "Hold your tongue; if you do not, I'll take care of you," or words to that effect. While I was on board the Sandwich, I forgot to mention, that I remonſtrated with the Priſoner, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout keeping thoſe diſgraceful ropes called yard-ropes, hanging; but the Delegates, among whom was the Prisoner, refuſed to remove them. I tried to prevail on them to return to their duty, their anſwer was, that the ſhip's company would not ſuffer them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was it with Parker?—<hi>A.</hi> It was him as well the reſt, they were all ſtanding together, the men who ſtyled themſelves Delegates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> In your converſations with him, did he ever ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear with a degree of inſolence?—<hi>A.</hi> He frequently did, but not uniformly; ſometimes with a great deal of modeſty, and of apparent reſpect, but very often otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was Lieutenant Juſtice the officer who brought the report of the mutiny breaking out on the 12th of May?—<hi>A.</hi> He was the officer who brought the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the breaking out of the mutiny in the Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>The following Letter from Richard Parker to Admiral Buckner, was read alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"Vice Admiral BUCKNER. Sir, I am command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to inform you, that we have this day taken the opinion of the Delegates of the Fleet, they univerſally agree, that the conduct of Adminiſtration has been highly improper in ſlopping the proviſions allowed the ſeamen, and that the fooliſh Proclamation which we have received, tends only to exaſperate the minds of honeſt men who are ſerving their country. I am, Sir, Your humble ſervant, RICHARD PARKER." Sheerneſs.</p>

                     <hi>Q.</hi> The Admiral mentions being on board the Sandwich, on the 20th of May, and having been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with no reſpect on coming on board; I wiſh to aſk, who was on board firſt on that day, you or I?<hi>A.</hi> I believe I was on board firſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> I would beg leave to aſk, do you think I was the perſon who cauſed you to be received with no reſpect?—<hi>A.</hi> I meant to ſay, that I was not received as I ought to be, I was received without a guard; as to the Priſoner, I was on board before him, and they attended me with a number of flags, not red flags, but union. I cannot anſwer the queſtion the Priſoner puts, becauſe I was on board before him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Do you deem me to be the perſon who cauſed you to be received with no reſpect?—<hi>A.</hi> I cannot ſay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Admiral Buckner, pleaſe to recollect, whether I did not come on the quarter-deck, ſeeing you was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived without reſpect, and informed you, (after aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſhip's company why they could be ſo diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as not to cheer their Admiral on coming on board) that it originated entirely in a miſtake, but if you would excuſe it, and receive it now, the crew would give you three cheers?—<hi>A.</hi> You did come to me and ſay, that no diſreſpect was intended me; ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, I believe, were made to man the ſhip, and you did ſay, that if I would receive it then, the people would man the yards; ſome attempts were made for that purpoſe, but by very few, the yard-ropes were hanging then.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> Does Admiral Buckner recollect that on going on ſhore he was attended by the boats of the Sandwich, and ſome other boats of the fleet, ſeeing no flag flying?<hi>A.</hi> When I was going on ſhore I did not know that my flag was ſtruck: ſeveral boats attended me.</p>
                  <p>The Court adviſed the Priſoner to invalidate, if he could, by any queſtion, that part of the narrative of Admiral Buckner which ſtated, that he had releaſed two marines, and told the Admiral that all his authority on board was at an end, that he had no authority, and that the power was in their hands.</p>

                  <head>The Admiral re-examined by the Court.</head>
                  <p>Q. When the Priſoner treated you with apparent reſpect and modeſty, was it privately, or publicly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſhip's company?—<hi>A.</hi> I never had any private converſation with him, and never ſaw him excepting once before the ſhip's company. When I ſaw him it was generally in a parade with a number of men from different ſhips, calling themſelves Delegates.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Q.</hi> When the Priſoner came to you to apologize for the want of reſpect on the part of the people on board, did he appear to influence or command the people?—<hi>A.</hi> I conceive by his coming to me to make the apology, he muſt have had ſome command in the ſhip. I had no opportunity of making that obſervation, as immediately after, he left the quarter-deck, and I did not ſee him again till he came with the paper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032837_0010_0FF554E29E833FB0"/>
to attend the puniſhment of one of the ſeamen on board the Sandwich, whoſe name was Cammell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> By whom was you ordered to attend? <hi>A.</hi> By Mr. Bray, the Maſter, who ſaid it was the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee's order, that I ſhould attend the puniſhment: I went on deck, the Priſoner was ſtanding on the gang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; as ſoon as the ſaid Cammell was tied up, the Priſoner made a ſpeech to the ſhip's company, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting them with the offence, which was drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneſs, and informed them, that if they violated the laws laid down by the Committee, they would ſhare the ſame fate.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> What do you mean by the Committee? <hi>A.</hi> By the Committee, I underſtand the members from the different ſhips, calling themſelves Delegates.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Was the Priſoner one of them? <hi>A.</hi> Yes, Two or three days after the above circumſtance, one of the ſhip's corporals of the Sandwich, whoſe name I believe is Wilſon, came to me with orders from the Committee, that I ſhould go between decks, as there was a man in irons who was very ill with a fever. I went, and ſaw the perſon that was then in irons, and I immediately deſired the ſaid ſhip's corporal to go to the Committee, and ſay that it was abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the priſoner to be taken out of irons, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into the ſick birth. He returned with an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that it was the Committee's order that I ſhould make the report in perſon. I accordingly went to the ſtarboard bay, on the lower deck, and there found a vaſt crowd of people aſſembled. I aſked whom I was to addreſs? The Priſoner, Parker, deſired me to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs him. I told him it was neceſſary to remove the ſick man, who was in irons: he ſaid, <q>It is not our intention to interfere with you at all; you may do with the ſick whatever you think proper.</q> When I was leaving what they called the Committee-room, one of the people, whom I ſuppoſed to be a Delegate, ſaid "Take off your hat, Sir." Then I turned round to ſee if I could recognize any of the Sandwich's peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and ſome one ſaid, "Be gone." It was not the priſoner, however.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> Had you ever received an anſwer from Parker with reſpect to the ſick? <hi>A.</hi> I generally received a ſimilar anſwer from Parker, "Do as you pleaſe with the ſick." I ſent to the Committee for permiſſion to go on ſhore.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> By whom? <hi>A.</hi> By Davis, who was then a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Officer in the ſhip, (as I underſtood) upon the quarter-deck. I was ordered by Davis to attend the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, and I then aſked their permiſſion to go on ſhore, as I had found ſome ſick on board, that wanted to go into the Hoſpital. The Priſoner, Parker, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the Committee to allow me to go, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I ſhould return the next morning; and I told them, I would uſe my influence with Admiral Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, with reſpect to the ſick. I went aſhore, and never returned, till the ſhip was under the command of the regular officers. One day, ſome time in May, during the mutiny, when Capt. Moſs was ſpeaking to the Priſoner on deck, and remonſtrating with him on the many improprieties which the men, then in a ſtate of mutiny, were committing, the priſoner ſaid, that "till their grievances were redreſſed, they would not one of them ſhrink," or words to that effect, if they did, he was certain they would be run up there, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the yard arm, where the ropes were reeved.</p>

                  <hi>Q.</hi> In all your viſits to thoſe people, did you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that he was the leading man? <hi>A.</hi> I underſtood him to be the Preſident of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> You found the Priſoner haranguing; did he ſeem to direct the proceedings? <hi>A.</hi> Parker ordered the Boatſwain's Mate to do his duty, and give twelve laſhes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> Did Parker order the puniſhment and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of laſhes? <hi>A.</hi> Yes, he did.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Q.</hi> In what capacity does the witneſs mean to ſay that Davis acted? <hi>A.</hi> I underſtood that Davis offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated as Captain of the ſhip.</p>

Q. When did theſe facts take place? A. The pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment was on the 14th of May.</p>
               <p>Q. When you underſtood Davis acted is Captain, how did you underſtand the priſoner to act? A. As Preſident of the Committee, and it was generally ſo underſtood.</p>

               <p>Q.

In going on board the Sandwich, he was received without any reſpect due to his rank as a Flag Officer. Inſtead of accepting the pardon, the Priſoner held in his hand ſeveral new propoſitions to be redreſſed, under the head of <hi>Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances,</hi> The Admiral was detained upwards of three hours on board, in conſequence of the ſhip's compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies

not coming to a determination reſpecting the prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſitions, at the end of which time, they were preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Priſoner to Admiral Buckner, in his cabin. The Admiral returned on ſhore, and was ſuffered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part without the reſpect due to his rank, the man-ropes were on the yards, and the yard-ropes reeved, and the Admiral treated with much diſreſpect, for which the Officers appeared extremely concerned, not having it in their power to treat their Admiral with the proper and uſual reſpect. I conſidered, therefore, the crew to be in a high ſtate of mutiny; ſeveral days after, I was at Commiſſioner Hartwell's houſe, the Admiral was there, it was reported to him, that two marines had been brought to the guard-houſe for examination, by the military. As I then ſtood at the fore-door, I ſaw the Priſoner, who aſked me, if the Commiſſioner could be ſpoken with; my anſwer was, I believed he was to be ſpoken with. The Priſoner came in, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by one Davis, and demanded to know the reaſon why the ſoldiers had brought the marines there. The Admiral aſked him what right he had to make ſuch a demand; the Priſoner ſaid, "I am not to be intimidat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—your flag is ſtruck, you have no authority here. <hi>I or We,</hi> (I do not recollect poſitively which) command the fleet." Parker immediately took out a paper, and put queſtions to the marines; to one in particular. He was ſuffered to interrogate them and carry them away. During this laſt interview with Admiral Buckner, the Priſoner behaved with the moſt daring inſolence and contempt. I have frequently ſeen the Priſoner head a body of men, whom they call Delegates of the fleet, and paſs and repaſs Commiſſioner Hartwell's houſe, with a red flag diſplayed in their proceſſion.</p>

               <p>Q. Do you know how long he belonged to the Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich? A. I cannot ſay how long he had been on board the Sandwich, he was on board the Hound, in April laſt, and was ſent from the Hound to the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, on the 11th of April.</p>

I ſaw nothing of the Priſoner at the time of the mutiny, until the 2d of June, on which day he came on board the Hound, on her arrival at the Nore; he then told me, that be had the honor of repreſenting the whole fleet, an honor, he ſhould never forget, that he underſtood that I had been very violent with ſome of the Delegates, and he adviſed me not to be ſo violent, for if I was, I muſt take the conſequence. He then told me, that he did not like the ſhip's company, and that he knew they were attached to me; for which reaſon, he ſhould put the ſhip in a ſafe birth where ſhe could not make her eſcape. He ordered the pilot to get the ſhip under weigh, and to carry her as cloſe to the Sandwich as poſſible; the pilot told him, it was an improper time of tide: the priſoner told the pilot, that if he did not chooſe to get her under weigh immediately, he would find means of making him, and at the ſame time he pointed to the yard-ropes. The Pilot got her under weight, and brought her cloſe to the Sandwich, and the Priſoner ordered the anchor to be let go. We were then hailed from the Sandwich, ſaying, we were too near them; the Priſoner replied, I think we are, Mr. Davis. He immediately turned to the pilot with
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032837_0018_0FF554F32C33F6B8"/>
threatening language, and did to him, you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted one miſtake, take care you do not commit another, if you do, I will make a beef-ſteak of you, at the yard-arm. The Priſoner ordered the pilot to get her under weigh again, and to moor her between the Sandwich and the Inflexible; ſhe was got under weigh, and came round to the Sandwich's quarter; then the priſoner had the hands turned up and harangued them, but what paſſed, I cannot exactly ſay. One thing I heard him ſay was, that he found they were not hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the cauſe, and that he ſhould be obliged to replace them with other people. He aſked them if they had any complaints againſt their officers, if they had, thoſe that they diſliked, were to be turned on ſhore, and thoſe that they liked were to be kept on board. He ſaid a vaſt deal to the people: after this, he ordered me out of the ſhip.</p>

                  <p>Q. How do you know that the Priſoner or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered you out of the ſhip? A. One of the Delegates came and ſaid, that I muſt leave the ſhip; I aſked the man by whoſe orders, the man replied, by Preſident Parker's order.</p>

                  <p>Q. Did he ſay by that name? A. Yes, he ſaid by Preſident Parker's orders, (the Priſoner.) The man told me, I was a dangerous character, and I ought to be laſhed on board the Inflexible, or on board the Montague. I ſaw them often, they were frequently rowing about with the red flag in the boat, and the Priſoner haranguing them. I think they had a band of muſic, I ſaw him addreſs the ſhip's people, but did not hear him, and they cheered him as he paſſed. There was a man put in irons, and I was told, it was by the order of the Priſoner: I ſaw the Priſoner go forward and ſpeak to him, and threaten him. I wrote two letters while I was on board, one on the Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſervice, and the other a private one; the Priſoner brought them back to me, they would not be allowed to go on ſhort, without being opened: I took my private letter, and told him he might open the other. He aſked me who they were for, I told him; he ſaid, there could be no communication on ſhore. One of the men ſtanding by, deſired him not to open it, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied

I now beg you to recollect, whether I did not ſay to you, (when I came on board the Hounds Captain Wood, the differences that are now exiſting in the fleet, are of a very unpleaſant nature: I feel myſelf in ſome degree, under an obligation to you; therefore, I would adviſe you to have nothing to do with it at preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, but ſuffer the Hound to proceed as the reſt of the ſhips, and I had no doubt, in the courſe of a day or two, at the fartheſt, the Officers would reſume their common command?

Monday, or Tueſday, about the 14th of June, the Priſoner came down from the deck and releaſed me, and told me, I might walk on deck, but muſt have no converſation with the people. The Priſoner ſent to Mr. Mott, on the ſame day, I think it was Tueſday. who came on the quarter-deck; I do not know what paſſed, but they called all hands by the priſoner's order; he told Mr. Mott to go on ſhore, and bring his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's pardon, he aſked the people if they were willing that Mr. Mott ſhould go, the anſwer by the people was, they were willing, and wiſhed that the ſhip might be given up to the officers.

                  <p>The Priſoner then made anſwer and ſaid to me, that if we hauled down the blue, and hoiſted the white, or changed the colors, there were three ſhips that would fire upon us. I called out again to ſtop the colors from being hoiſted, till Lieutenant Mott ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. Lieutenant Mott agreed in that particular, and the people alſo. Lieutenant Mott went to the ſhore, and brought the King's proclamation: then the Priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner ordered all hands up, and it was read upon the quarter deck, by William Clark, deputy-purſer. The Priſoner then ſpoke to the people and aſked them, whether they were willing to accept of His Majeſty's pardon, or to let her remain with us, as the Priſoner termed it, (meaning themſelves) the people all anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to the Officers, excepting two of the priſoners, now in cuſtody, (Thomas Jones, and one Davis) who then ſaid, the ſhips a-ſtern would fire on us: the Priſoner alſo ſaid, if we changed our colors, the ſhips a-ſtern would fire on us.</p>

Yes: then the people all called out, haul down the blue, and hoiſt the white. I then ſaid, (and I will repeat the words now in the language I uſed at that time) they may fire and be damned: then the Priſoner joined the others in opinion, and ſaid, we

                  <p>I gave orders to get ready for unmooring the ſhip, as ſoon as the arms were ſecured by the Steward.

I conſulted with the Officers, whether it was proper to confine the Priſoner before we got under weigh, or wait till we came to the garriſon at Sheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and it was agreed upon, that we ſhould confine him immediately. Lieutenant Mott and myſelf went and met the Priſoner on the quarter-deck: Lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Mott laid hold of the Priſoner, and brought him down to the lower deck, and put him into a lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant's cabin, and placed two centinals over him.

He upon this ordered a ſpring to be got on the cable, to bring her broadſide to bear upon the Repulſe; when the ſpring was on, he ordered it to be hove in, and to bear away the beſt bower: as the ſhip came round, he ordered them to point their guns

               <p>Q. Do you know the Priſoner? A. Yes.</p>
               <p>Q. Which is him? A. That gentleman who ſtands there, <hi>(pointing to the Priſoner.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Q. Did you ſee the Priſoner on board the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth at the time the Repulſe got a ground in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to eſcape into Sheerneſs harbour? A. I did.</p>
               <p>Q Relate ſuch particulars of his conduct as you ſaw, or any acts of violence againſt the Repulſe? A. I ſaw a great many people aſſembled on the forecaſtle, I went up to ſee what was the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter, I ſaw the Priſoner ſtanding abaft the foremoſt on ſome thing, above the deck, he was going to make a ſpeech. Captain Vance, who was acting as Captain then, of our ſhip, wanted to ſpeak firſt, the Priſoner would not allow it, he would inſiſt on the ſhip's ſlipping her cable, there were no other cables bent at the time: the ſhip's company would not agree to it; he ſaid, he would go on board one of the outſide ſhips, and make her ſlip her cable, and go along ſide of the Leopard, and ſend her to Hell, where ſhe ought to go. During the time of this ſpeech, the Repulſe got off the ground: the Priſoner diſmounted himſelf from the place where he was on, ſhook his fiſt, ſwore, and ſaid, d—n me, ſhe is off. He directly called the boat's crew from on board the Sandwich, in which boat he went himſelf. That is all I have to ſay.</p>
               <p>Q. While the Monmouth was firing at the Repulſe, did you ſee the Priſoner active in pointing the guns, or otherwiſe directing them to be fired, or pointed? A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. Was there a hawſer carried out from the Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, to bring her broadſide to bear on the Repulſe? A. There was one brought along ſide, by another ſhip's boat, that was made faſt, and the ſhip brought to bear on the Repulſe.</p>
               <p>Q. What was the hawſer made faſt to? A. The hawſer was made faſt to the beſt bower-cable: having broke a ſmall cord or tow-line, they veered away the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:032837_0036_0FF555341769BA88"/>
beſt bower, and faſtened it to the cable; then they brought her ſide to bear on the Repulſe.</p>
               <p>Q. Did the Priſoner give any directions with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to carrying the tow-line out, or getting the ſpring upon the cable, afterwards? A. Not to my knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge.</p>
               <p>Q. During the time the Monmouth kept a heavy fire on the Repulſe, did you ſee the Priſoner with his clothes off, to favor any exertions he was about? A. I did not.</p>
               <p>Q. How long did the heavy fire from the Monmouth to the Repulſe continue? A. I believe near two hours.</p>
               <p>Q. You do not mean the heavy fire laſted two hours, but from the beginning to the ending.</p>
               <p>Q. No, I mean the whole of the firing, the heavy fire was, I believe, about twenty-five minutes.</p>

               <p>As I have been at ſea from my youth, I therefore hope nothing will be expected from me but a narrative of plain facts. I cannot dreſs up my defence in the pompous language of a lawyer; could I have procured aſſiſtance, I might have been enabled to have expreſſed myſelf with more propriety.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, I have to return thanks to this Court for giving me the time they have, to defend my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf againſt the very heavy charges brought againſt me. Nothing but the conſciouſneſs of the integrity of my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions with reſpect to the mutiny, and the reflection that I did not enter into it until two days after it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, could have ſupported me againſt ſuch heavy charges, ſworn to by ſo many witneſſes, and a firm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that I entered into it ſolely with the view of repreſſing the dangerous ſpirit I ſaw predominant in the fleet. The firſt witneſs called againſt me was Vice-Admiral Buckner, who ſays he often ſaw me, and he acknowledges my behavior to him was always reſpectful. I never waited on Admiral Buckner with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the expreſs orders of the Delegates; and when I did, ſtudiouſly avoided ſporting with his feelings, by improper behavior; on the contrary, I couched eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meſſage I had to deliver in the moſt reſpectful terms I was able. It may be aſked how I came to be th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> perſon pitched upon to deliver ſuch meſſages, and act as the principal in the buſineſs. To this I can only anſwer, that ſuch was the caſe. The Delegates inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on my aſſuming the ſituation I appeared in, and it
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:032837_0039_0FF51ACE1FA96090"/>
was impoſſible for me, or any individual under ſimilar circumſtances, to have reſiſted ſuch an appointment. I know nothing of the mutiny till it had broke out. As ſoon as I ſaw that fatal ſpirit of the mutiny which prevailed, I immediately thought it my duty, and I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored, as far as in me lay, to ſtop the further progreſs of it. However melancholy have been the events which have taken place, I am convinced more dreadful conſequences would have enſued, had I not acted the part I have done—conſequences, which I heſitate not in ſaying, I have prevented, at the hazard of my life; and feeling that I have done whatever was in my power to leſſen the evil, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> could not wholly prevent, I can wait the deciſion of the Court with calmneſs and reſignation. Admiral Buckner repreſents, that on or about the 20th of May, he was not received with that reſpect which was due to his rank. I was ſorry that it ſhould have been ſo, but that he cannot bring home to me, as he was on board before me, and I was at the time on ſhore, attending a proceſſion; and the Admiral himſelf acknowledges, that when I did go on board I went on the quarter-deck and ſaid, it muſt have been owing to ſome miſtake, he was not received with the honors due to him; and I offered that the men ſhould man the yards, if he would receive the cheers He acknowledges an attempt was made to man the yards, which afterwards ſubſided. It was ſo, an attempt was made <hi>by me</hi> to that effect, though at that time it was a thing dangerous to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and done at the riſk of my life, for it was ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, if it was complied with, that the Inflexible and the other ſhips, would fire upon and ſink the Sandwich; a report having been propagated that Admiral Buckner was not a fit perſon to reconcile the fleet with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty, which ſo diſcompoſed our people, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect intended to be ſhewn was defeated. Capt. Moſs ſent Mr. Bray on board the Inflexible, where he ſaid he found the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ompions out of the guns, the matches ready, and every appearance of hoſtility. During the whole continuance of the mutiny, there were daily meetings of the Committee of the Delegates of the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:032837_0040_0FF5554071DE1530"/>
ſhips. The Delegates received propoſitions, for all meaſures originated on board the Inflexible; and there is not a man of the whole fleet, who does not attribute the melancholy conſequences that took place, to the violence of the people of the Inflexible. It was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent thoſe conſequences, I went on ſhore to Admiral Buckner, and when I was half paſſage to ſhore, I firſt obſerved the Admiral's flag down, and the red one in its ſtead. In anſwer to what Admiral Buckner has ſaid reſpecting the two marines, I do not deny being commanded by the Delegates of the fleet to act as I did. The circumſtances were theſe: The people call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Delegates, repreſenting the ſhip's company were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing themſelves with their uſual allowance, which was a pint of beer to each man. In the mean time they were informed, that two marines were in cuſtody, of the main-guard, for approving of the conduct of the ſeamen. The Delegates deſired me to inquire if it was ſo. I did. The Officer ſaid he had no ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in cuſtody. We were informed, that the two marines were at Commiſſioner Hartwell's houſe. We accordingly went and told him to releaſe the men, and ſend them on board, where their conduct ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into, and the men puniſhed if they deſerved it. We ſaw Admiral Buckner, who ſaid the marines had uſed very improper language at a houſe at Queen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, but as we were ſent by the Delegates, he had no objection to our examining them. One of them appeared in a ſtate of intoxication. I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="42" facs="unknown:032837_0041_0FF55542014C7560"/>
towards Admiral Buckner: I remember a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, wherein Admiral Buckner ſaid, conſuler what muſt have been my feelings at ſeeing my flag ſtruck. I replied, I had nothing to do with ſtriking your flag. I told him I could judge what his feelings muſt have been on ſuch an occaſion; that I had feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of my own, and could eaſily participate in his, but that I could not prevent them, as I was but a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle individual among many. Having done with Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Buckner's evidence, I think it but juſtice to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that both Admiral Buckner, and Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner Hartwell, did every thing that lay in their power to ſatisfy the minds of the fleet. The next evidence was Lieutenant Juſtice, he ſays, he knows nothing of me. The third was Captain O'Bryen, who ſays, he knows nothing to the diſadvantage of me. Captain Fancourt ſaid, he never ſaw me before. Captain Cobb, depoſed to the ſame effect; as did Captain Parr, and Captain Hargood likewiſe.</p>
               <p>Mr. John Snipe depoſes, that on the afternoon of the 14th of May, he was called on to attend the puniſhment of a man of the name of Cammell, and that I ordered him a dozen laſhes. I do not attempt to deny that I did act as he has ſworn. I was commanded to ſee the puniſhment inflicted, but Mr. Bray was conſulted as to the propriety of inflicting ſuch a puniſhment for the offence he had commited, which was for getting beaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drunk, at the ſame time aſſerting he had drank noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but ſmall beer. I recommended to the whole ſhip's crew to abſtain from liquor until the whole of the buſineſs was ſettled, telling them, if they did not, that the puniſhment which their juſtice had inflicted on that man, ſhould be inflicted on any one offending. As to the ſick man in irons, it was a man confined for diſreſpect to Captain Moſs; the anſwer given by me, on that occaſion, to Mr. Snipe, ſufficiently ſhews, that I did not mean to interfere with his profeſſional con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns; and I hope it will have the effect of ſhewing to the Court, that I was alive to the ſufferings of my fellow-creatures. Mr. Snipe has ſaid, that he had leave to go on ſhore, on his promiſing to return again
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:032837_0042_0FF555438CBAAAC0"/>
the next morning, but that he took care not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, till the ſhip was under the command of its offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. I ſhall make no comment on this part of his evidence, but I ſhall only aſk, whether it was praiſe worthy on his part, at a time when the ſeamen were laboring under incurable diſorders, for a ſurgeon to leave the ſhip, merely becauſe his ſituation was not ſo comfortable as he could have wiſhed.</p>
               <p>I next come to the evidence of Capt. Surridge, of the Iris; he ſays, that he has ſeen me once at the Commiſſioner's houſe, and that he afterwards ſaw me come up to the Commiſſioners, where he recollects my delivering to him the articles containing the final de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the North Sea ſquadron. I do declare, that I had no converſation with the Commiſſioners, but left it entirely to them to ſatisfy themſelves, that the articles I had preſented, really did contain the demands of that fleet. Capt. Surridge has declared, that he ſaw no diſreſpect on my part towards him, therefore I ſhall not dwell further on his evidence, but anſwer it in the general concluſion.</p>
               <p>The next evidence is Capt. Dixon, of the L'Eſpion, but as any obſervations in his evidence are anſwered by what I have obſerved with reſpect to Admiral Buckner, and Capt. Surridge, I ſhall decline commenting on it.</p>
               <p>I now come to the evidence of Capt. John Wood, of the Hound, who has depoſed, that I w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nt on board his ſhip, and adviſed him not to be ſo violent. I cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly did go on board, but I had no other motive than the perſonal ſafety of the Captain, and the preſervation of the ſhip. He ſays he was ordered out of his ſhip, but he has never produced who ordered him out. In anſwer to this, I ſolemnly aſſert I did not know that he was ordered to leave his ſhip, the orders were not, certainly given by me, and though I have heard it in the Court, I never heard it in the ſhip. As to my having ſaid I would make a beef-ſteak of the Pilot at the yard-arm, I ſolemnly declare I did not make uſe of ſuch expreſſions. I do not recollect the Pilot's let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting go the anchor. I declare to God I know nothing of it. If I was before the face of God, I would deny
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:032837_0043_0FF555451861DA10"/>
it. As to the yard ropes, they were reeved before I was on board. It is very poſſible Capt. Wood might be miſtaken, as to my being the perſon who gave the order.</p>
               <p>Lieutenant Flatt depoſes he does not know me. As I ſhall have occaſion to aſk Lieutenant Flatt ſome more queſtions, I ſhall not make any further obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on his evidence, till he has been examined again.</p>
               <p>Mr. Levingſton, boatſwain of the Director, depoſes, that he ſaw me on board the Director, at the time the Repulſe was on ſhore, that I aſked him for a boat, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, that it might be the means of ſaving many lives. He recollects my giving the word fire. After which, Mr. Samuel Hilliard depoſes, that he ſaw me on board the Director, that he heard me addreſs the ſhip's company, and that ſoon after the guns were fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but that he did not hear me order it. In the firſt place, in order to account for my being on board the Director—I only went on board to prevent the effuſion of human blood. When the demands of the North Sea Fleet were known, a boat went round to the whole fleet, with a band of muſic, playing, God ſave the King, Rule Britannia, and Britons Strike Home; for which, were the ſhip journals produced, they would prove it was the command of the whole ſhip's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. I was deſired to be on that duty. Matthew Holliſter informed me on board the Sandwich, that the Repulſe was getting under way, and that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector was getting a ſpring on her cable. I was then commanded on board the Director. I ſaw the guns on the quarter deck caſt looſe. I pointed out the impropriety and cruelty of one brother fighting againſt another; and I begged for a flag of truce, which was refuſed. I then founded their diſpoſitions, by propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to go along ſide the Repulſe; this I did, in order to ſee how far they would proceed; and I was happy to find they did not approve of ſo doing. My reaſon for aſking for a flag of truce was, I thought if I could obtain permiſſion to take it, none of the other ſhips would fire on the Repulſe, out of reſpect to the flag of truce they had granted, but finding myſelf oppoſed, I was obliged to act a part I abominated, and which,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:032837_0044_0FF5554E200CC5E0"/>
to my grief, I ſaw before I came on board. I do not recollect giving orders to fire; but if I did, they muſt have been the orders of compulſion, and not choice.</p>
               <p>Thomas Barry, ſeaman, depoſed, I was on board the Monmouth; he muſt have been greatly miſtaken in what he has related, but I will prove I was not at that time on board the Monmouth, that I was then on board the Director, and that he muſt have confuſed me with ſome other perſon. He depoſed that I ſaid FIRE, and that after the firing the ſixth or ſeventh gun from the forecaſtle, that on the gun being loaded the ſeventh time, I was not content with a nine pound ſhot, but that I put a crowbar into the mouth of the gun. He relates ſome one being confined by a man called Capt. Vance. He alſo ſwore that when the Repulſe got off, I ſhook my fiſt, and ſaid, "D—n me, ſhe's off, and that I ſwore I would take one of the outſide ſhips, and ſend her to Hell, where ſhe belonged to:" and on my aſking him what had been promiſed to him for telling this helliſh ſtory, he anſwered, "nothing had been promiſed him." I do declare that I went on board the Sandwich in the Ardent's boat, and not in the manner deſcribed by Barry.</p>
               <p>John Summerland does not recollect my working with my clothes off, but he ſays. I was on board the Monmouth. In fact, I was more in want of reſt, than anxious to look after Don Quixotte adventures. I did go on board the Monmouth it is certain, but with the ſame views I had in going on board the Director. As to my having ſaid I would take an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide ſhip and repair to the Leopard, I could have no other motive for ſo doing, than to make her keep her ſtation. Some days previous to the Sandwich being delivered up, the Montague made a ſignal for a Dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, I thought they were by no means amicable, with reſpect to their diſpoſitions in general, and therefore, the ſignal was not complied with.</p>
               <p>I have now made all the remarks which occur to me on the evidence. I now addreſs myſelf again to the Court, not for the purpoſe of intimating, that where mercy can be extended, it ought to be ſhewn, being
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:032837_0045_0FF555513AF56DF8"/>
aſſured that I ſhall have ſtrict juſtice; but I appeal to them to attend particularly to the evidence of Barry. However I may have been miſrepreſented in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic prints, my intentions were good. My character is dearer to me than a thouſand lives. My country al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows me juſtice, and juſtice I truſt I ſhall have from this honorable Court.</p>

               <p>The Court, purſuant to an order of the Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for executing the Office of Lord High Admiral, hearing date the 19th of June, 1797, directed to Sir Thomas Paiſley, Vice-Admiral, have proceeded to try Richard Parker, (he being a perſon belonging to his Majeſty's fleet) on a charge for having made, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to make, a dangerous mutiny and mutinous aſſemblies on board his Majeſty's ſhip, the Sandwich, and divers other ſhips and veſſels, under the command of Vice Admiral Buckner, at the Nore: and alſo on a charge of having behaved with contempt to the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers

on duty, and having diſobeyed his ſuperior offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</p>
               <p>The Court having heard the witneſſes on the part of the crown, in ſupport of the charge, and what the priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner has related in his defence, and the evidence in ſupport of what he has alledged upon the ſame, the Court are unanimouſly of opinion, that the whole of the charge is fully proved, that the crimes are as unprece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented as they are wicked, and as ruinous to the navy as to the peace and proſperity of the country. The Court doth therefore adjudge him to ſuffer <hi>DEATH,</hi> and he is ordered to ſuffer death accordingly, at ſuch time and place as the Lords Commiſſioners of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty, or any three of them ſhall direct and appoint.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Parker the Priſoner,</hi> with a degree of fortitude and undiſmayed compoſure, which excited the aſtoniſhment and admiration of every one preſent, ſpoke as follows:</p>
               <p>"I bow to your ſentence with all due ſubmiſſion, being convinced I have acted from the dictates of a good conſcience. God Almighty, who knows the hearts of all men, will, I hope, receive me. I hope that my death alone will atone to the Country; and that thoſe brave men, who have acted with me will receive a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral pardon; I am ſatisfied they will return to their duty with alacrity."</p>

                  <p>It is in the breaſt of the Court to order you for execution immediately, but we think it better to give you time to repent your crime.</p>

               <p>The Court adjourned at half paſt four.</p>
               <p>The preſſure of the crowd to hear the defence of Parker, was immenſe.</p>
               <p>The OATH which the Witneſſes took, was as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: "I ſwear by God, and as I ſhall anſwer to Almighty God, at the great Day of Judgment; that the evidence I ſhall give, ſhall be the Truth, the Whole Truth, and nothing but the Truth, ſo help me God!"</p>
