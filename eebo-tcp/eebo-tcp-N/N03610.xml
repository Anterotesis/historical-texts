            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>In the next Place it is to be obſerved, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> being entred into <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> he went directly to the <hi>Temple</hi>: He, as the <hi>Head</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>But to proceed;</p>
            <p>The Chief Prieſts and Scribes taking No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the wonderful Things, which <hi>Chriſt</hi> did; and of the <hi>Words,</hi> which were ſpoken by the <hi>Children, viz.

Not by ſaulting him for the Cures, which he wro't on the Blind, and Lame; No, for then, all the People would have cry'd out <hi>Shame upon 'em:</hi> But, they blam'd the <hi>Children,</hi> or rather <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for ſuffering the <hi>Children,</hi> to do him as great Honour, as tho' he was a <hi>God</hi>; Or elſe, for allowing them to meddle with that, which, as they ſuppoſed, thoſe <hi>Children</hi> did not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand; and therefore, as they imagin'd, took the Name of the Lord their God in vain — <hi>Heareſt thou what they ſay?</hi> That is, Doſt thou take Notice of it or not? If not, they ſpend their Breath in vain: And if thou doſt hear and obſerve, then, why are they allowed to go on?— Whereunto, <hi>Jeſus</hi> replyed, <hi>Have ye never read, out of the Mouth of Babes and Sucklings thou haſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected

               <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. 8.2.</note>: For, "it is to the Praiſe of God's Strength; yea, his Praiſe is <hi>perfected,</hi> when he inclines and enables ſuch <hi>weak</hi> Inſtruments to ſhow forth his Praiſes."</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Chriſt</hi> anſwered the chief Prieſts and Scribes; and it was ſufficient to <hi>ſtill thoſe E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of his,</hi> who would gladly, if they dar'd, have <hi>aveng'd</hi> themſelves on him <note n="*" place="bottom">Same Verſe.</note>:— We don't read of <hi>any Reply,</hi> that they made to <hi>Chriſt</hi>: Whether is was, becauſe they were convicted in their own Conſciences, that they were in the wrong; or, whether, becauſe they had not the Opportunity for it; is uncertain: But this is certain, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> quickly left them, and went out of the City into <hi>Bethany,</hi> and lodged there, which was about <hi>two</hi> Miles diſtant from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>; for they had forfeited the Favour of his Preſence.</p>
            <p>It is very evident, from <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the <hi>Children</hi> to forbear; and from his making ſuch a Reply as he did, to the chief Prieſts and Scribes; that he allowed of, yea, that he was <hi>pleaſed</hi> with, the <hi>Children's Hoſannas.

               <p>But, the <hi>Truth</hi> of the Doctrine will yet <hi>more</hi> clearly appear, by conſidering theſe few Things following, <hi>viz</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. It is the expreſs <hi>Commandment</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> that Perſons <hi>ſeek firſt the Kingdom of God and his Righteouſneſs.</hi> Matt. 6 33. <hi>Seek firſt</hi>; that is, not only firſt in Affection, and above all other Things; but alſo, <hi>firſt in Time,</hi> and <hi>before</hi> all other Things. And in Eccleſ. 12.1· it is written, <hi>Remember now thy Creator in the Days of thy Youth.</hi>—You may not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that Perſons are hereby excuſed, from remembring the Lord in their <hi>Childhood</hi>; No verily; but, the Words may be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, as related, or connected, to thoſe immediately preceeding, which are, <hi>Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and Youth are Vanity:</hi> So that, the Meaning is this, do not, like many others, who ſpend their <hi>Childhood</hi> and <hi>Youth</hi> in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; but, in your <hi>early</hi> Days, remember your Creator, even, as ſoon as you are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and have the Exerciſe of Reaſon.— <hi>Children!</hi> here's a Remedy preſcrib'd to cure you of your Vanity, and that is, remember <hi>now</hi> thy Creator: And it is the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Expectation of the great GOD, who has lately form'd and faſhion'd <hi>you,</hi> that <hi>you</hi> apply and improve this Remedy. Indeed, if you can make it appear, that the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004413_0015_100D50111A86DCF0"/>
Lord is <hi>not your</hi> Creator, then, <hi>you are</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed from remembring and obeying him; but otherwiſe, <hi>you</hi> are <hi>not.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. I may argue further, for the <hi>Proof</hi> of the Doctrine, <hi>viz</hi> from the Conſideration, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> has <hi>ordered,</hi> that <hi>little Children be allowed to come to him,</hi> and <hi>that they be not forbidden</hi>—.</p>
               <p>This is plainly ſet forth before us, in Matt. 19.13, 14, 15.— Thoſe Perſons, who bro't theſe <hi>Children,</hi> ſhew'd their Love to, and Faith in, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> but the Diſciples rebuked them; probably, thinking it to be <hi>below</hi> their Maſter, to regard <hi>Children</hi>; or elſe, that he had Work enough beſides: But, for what Reaſon ſoever they did it, yet <hi>Chriſt</hi> was <hi>diſpleaſed</hi> with them for it, and ſaid, <hi>Suffer little Children to come to me, and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> Yea, and he actually <hi>laid his Hands on them,</hi> in token of his <hi>bleſſing them</hi>: "And thus, our Lord aſſerted the Rights of the <hi>Lambs</hi> of his Flock: To them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Privileges of viſible Church-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip, as among the <hi>Jews</hi> of old;" for, ſays our <hi>Saviour, of ſuch is the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> They are Members of the viſible Church, being Children of believing Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents: Now, the <hi>Promiſe</hi> is to ſuch <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,</hi> and to their <hi>Children.</hi> Acts 2.39.—It is very plain, that theſe <hi>Children,</hi> who were bro't to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> were <hi>ſmall</hi>; even, ſo little, as to be bro't in the Arms; probably, they

were a Year or two old, or leſs: And it is as plain, that they were <hi>very welcome</hi> to <hi>Chriſt.</hi>— Which by the Way, affords a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry weighty Argument for <hi>Infant Baptiſm</hi>: — But, not to inſiſt upon that at preſent, but to come to what I intend; I may argue thus,</p>
               <p>If <hi>Chriſt welcom'd little Children,</hi> when they were <hi>bro't</hi> to him <hi>by others</hi>; doubtleſs, it is <hi>pleaſing to him,</hi> when <hi>Children come</hi> to him <hi>themſelves</hi> and do <hi>actually</hi> and <hi>volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi> join in the Exerciſes of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praiſe,</hi> giving to him the glory due to his Name, and waiting upon him for his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: If the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> will <hi>accept</hi> of <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dren,</hi> when offered and dedicated by their <hi>Parents</hi>; without Queſtion, he will accept of them, when <hi>they preſent themſelves,</hi> an Offering unto the Lord Pious Parents de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote their <hi>Children</hi> to the Lord, <hi>deſiring,</hi> that they may be his; but when the <hi>Children</hi> preſent <hi>themſelves,</hi> it is ſuppoſed that they are <hi>determined</hi> to be his. In the <hi>parental</hi> Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>Children</hi> are meerly <hi>paſſive,</hi> but in the <hi>Self</hi>-Dedication, they are <hi>active</hi>; and we would hope, <hi>ſincere</hi> too, in Obedience to that Command, which is written in Prov. 23 26 MY SON, GIVE ME THINE HEART.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I might alſo mention, by Way of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, the <hi>Pleas,</hi> which <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath been pleaſed to put into the <hi>Mouths</hi> of <hi>Children.</hi> — I ſhall juſt hint at one or two of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:004413_0016_100D5012A41A08F0"/>Thus, they have their <hi>Baptiſm</hi> to plead with <hi>Chriſt,</hi> for his Acceptance of them: This Ordinance is adminiſtred to the <hi>Infants</hi> of believing Parents; and is done, as we conceive, by the Order and Appointment of our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Saviour</hi>: And it both lays Perſons under Engagements to be his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and gives <hi>them Ground</hi> to hope for, and expect, his Acceptance and Bleſſing, when <hi>they</hi> make it their great <hi>Care</hi> to <hi>fulfill</hi> thoſe Engagements.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, <hi>they</hi> have a <hi>ſpecial</hi> Word of <hi>Promiſe</hi> put into their Mouths, to plead with <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Such as that, in Prov. 8.17. <hi>They that ſeek me</hi> EARLY, <hi>ſhall find me.</hi> And that, in Iſa. 45.19. <hi>I ſaid not unto the</hi> SEED <hi>of Jacob, ſeek ye me in vain</hi> And many other that might be named.—</p>
               <p>Now, I ſay, <hi>Chriſt</hi> having furniſhed <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> with <hi>ſuch Pleas,</hi> it argues, that it is <hi>pleaſing</hi> to him, when they improve them in the Ways of divine Appointment; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, in the Duty of <hi>Prayer</hi>—.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The <hi>Truth</hi> of the Doctrine is further evident, from the Conſideration, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> has <hi>commanded</hi> his <hi>Miniſters</hi> to feed his <hi>Lambs:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This may be ſeen, in <hi>John</hi> 21.15. Which Words were directed, not to <hi>Peter only,</hi> but, do alſo concern <hi>all</hi> thoſe, who ſerve in the Work and Buſineſs of the Miniſtry. — And truly, not only Miniſters, but alſo <hi>Parents,</hi> and even <hi>all</hi> who have the

                  <hi>Care</hi> of <hi>Children,</hi> are obliged to train them up in the Way they ſhould go; and to bring them up in the Nurture and Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord.— Now, doubtleſs, theſe Things argue, that <hi>Chriſt</hi> is <hi>pleaſed,</hi> when <hi>Children</hi> engage in religious Exerciſes <hi>them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvos.</hi> — The <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> would have <hi>Children</hi> inſtructed by his Miniſters, and by their Parents, and others, who have them under their Watch, for <hi>this very End, viz.</hi> that they may be led, <hi>actually,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in his Service themſelves. He would have them to know their Duty, in order to do it: And <hi>the ſooner</hi> they underſtand, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in, and practiſe their Duty, <hi>the more</hi> do they <hi>pleaſe</hi> and <hi>gratify</hi> the <hi>Lord Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 It is agreable to <hi>Scripture Prophecies</hi> and <hi>Promiſes,</hi> that <hi>Children</hi> ſhould bring Praiſe to the Name of God, by <hi>their Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>See for this Purpoſe, that fore-cited Pſal. 8.2. <hi>Out of the Mouth of Babes and Suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, haſt thou ordained Strength</hi>; or, <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Praiſe,</hi> as in our Context. And agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hereto, is that in Iſa 44 3, 4, 5 <hi>I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my Bleſſing upon thine Offspring, and they ſhall ſpring up as among the Graſs, as Willows by the Water-Courſes; One ſhall ſay, I am the Lord's; and another ſhall call himſelf by the Name of Jacob; and another ſhall ſubſcribe with his Hand unto the Lord, and ſirname himſelf by the Name of Iſrael.</hi> — Now I ſay,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004413_0017_100D5014C99913B8"/>
it is abundantly evident, from ſuch like Promiſes and Prophecies, that the <hi>Devotions</hi> of <hi>Children</hi> are <hi>pleaſing</hi> to <hi>Chriſt</hi> He is <hi>greatly delighted,</hi> when the holy Scriptures are fulfilled, eſpecially, the <hi>promiſſory</hi> Part, or, that which brings Glory to his Name, and, at the ſame Time, holds forth Grace and Favour to the Children of Men.</p>
               <p n="6">6 It alſo appears from <hi>Chriſt's inclining</hi> and <hi>diſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To illuſtrate this, conſider briefly,</p>
               <p>It is a very common Thing for <hi>Children</hi> to delight in <hi>Play</hi>; and it is very natural for them to <hi>Sin,</hi> they even incline to it, as the Sparks to fly upwards: From hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that they are naturally <hi>averſe</hi> to the religious Exerciſes of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praiſe</hi>: They are corrupt, each one, for that which is born of the Fleſh is Fleſh; and the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Mind is Enmity againſt God. — So then, we may conclude, that whenever <hi>Children</hi> do freely and voluntarily engage in <hi>religious</hi> Exerciſes, that it is CHRIST, who, by the Operations of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt, inclines</hi> them thereunto. — Alaſs! How many <hi>Children</hi> are there, who are well inſtructed, and yet, don't incline to ſeek and ſerve the <hi>Lord!</hi> May we not then look upon it, as the Work of the <hi>Lord,</hi> when <hi>ſome</hi> are <hi>thus</hi> inclined; and eſpecially, if <hi>they continue</hi> in

the Way of Well-doing? Doubtleſs, we may<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we ought, to account it to be the <hi>Doing</hi> of the <hi>Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I ſay, if it is <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who by his <hi>Spirit, inclines Children</hi> to <hi>religious</hi> Exerciſes, then, without Queſtion, he is <hi>pleaſed</hi> with <hi>their Devotions:</hi> For, he would have all, old and young, to <hi>regard</hi> the Motions and Strivings of the Holy <hi>Spirit.</hi> Hence it is ſaid in 1 Theſ. 5.19 <hi>Quench not the Spirit.</hi> And in Eph. 4 30 <hi>Grieve not the holy Spirit of God.</hi> And agreable to this, we find, that it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry offenſive to God, when Perſons are <hi>ſo ſtiff-necked,</hi> as <hi>to reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Acts. 7.15.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only add,</p>
               <p n="7">7. and laſtly. As the <hi>firſt ripe</hi> Fruits are, ordinarily, of greateſt Account among Men, even ſo, <hi>early</hi> Religion is moſt highly pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We find that it was an Ordinance of old, Exod 22 29 <hi>Thou ſhalt not delay to offer the firſt of thy ripe Fruits</hi>—: Which teaches us, that <hi>little Children</hi> may <hi>not delay</hi> to offer unto God, the <hi>firſt Fruits</hi> of their <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> for with <hi>ſuch</hi> Sacrifices <hi>God</hi> is <hi>well pleaſed,</hi> yea, the Lord accepts them with a ſweet Savour. — We read alſo in Gen. 4.4. <hi>That Abel brought of the Firſtlings of his Flock, and of the Fat thereof</hi>—: Which teaches us, that it is a good Thing for <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> to be well taught, and train'd up <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi> in <hi>religious</hi> Services (as Abel was) that ſo, when they come to be capable of acting

for themſelves, they may, of their own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord (as Abel did) bring an Offering to the Lord: Yea, "and he was <hi>curious</hi> in the Choice of his Offering, for he bro't not the Lame, or the Lean, or the Refuſe, but the <hi>Firſtlings</hi> of the Flock, the <hi>beſt</hi> he had, and the <hi>Fat</hi> thereof; that is, the <hi>beſt</hi> of thoſe beſt." From whence we learn, that <hi>he</hi> who is the <hi>Firſt</hi> and beſt, ſhould have the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>beſt</hi> of our <hi>Time, Strength,</hi> and <hi>Service</hi>—: Well, but how did <hi>Abel ſucceed</hi> in his Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? Truly very well; for it is added, that <hi>the Lord had Reſpect unto Abel, and to his Offering.</hi>— And indeed, it holds true to this very Day, <hi>viz</hi> That all ſuch who ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely offer the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>beſt</hi> of what they <hi>have,</hi> and <hi>can do,</hi> unto the Lord <hi>Jeſus,</hi> they ſhall be <hi>accepted</hi> of him, which is the Thing principally to be aim'd at in <hi>all</hi> Acts of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: Yea, he hath a <hi>ſpecial Delight</hi> in all ſuch <hi>little Ones,</hi> who truly fear and ſerve him: Not only is there Joy in the Preſence of the <hi>Angels</hi> of God over ſuch, but the <hi>Lord of Glory himſelf takes Pleaſure</hi> in them, and <hi>his Delights</hi> are with <hi>theſe</hi> Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Men.</p>

               <p>Furthermore, <hi>well diſpoſed Children</hi> are <hi>moſt likely</hi> to <hi>continue</hi> in the Service of God, and to <hi>abound</hi> in well-doing; which if they

In a Word;</p>
               <p>It is undeniable, that <hi>Sin</hi> is the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Thing which the Soul of God hates: It is <hi>this</hi> by which his holy Law is violat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his curious Workmanſhip in his Creature, Man, abuſed: It is <hi>this,</hi> and this <hi>alone,</hi> which reflects <hi>Diſhonour</hi> to the Name of God: So then; for Perſons to devote them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Service of <hi>Chriſt</hi> in their <hi>early</hi> Days, muſt needs be very <hi>pleaſing</hi> to him; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

               <p>And I may add;</p>
               <p>That when we behold <hi>Children religiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſed,</hi> we have a fair <hi>Proſpect</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion's</hi> being <hi>tranſmitted</hi> and <hi>propagated</hi> to thoſe, who are yet <hi>to be born</hi>; and that <hi>they alſo,</hi> ſhall be to the <hi>Lord,</hi> for <hi>a Name</hi> and <hi>a Praiſe:</hi> Which Proſpect moves the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God to <hi>bleſs</hi> and <hi>magnify</hi> his holy <hi>Name</hi>; as alſo, miniſters much <hi>Joy</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> unto <hi>them</hi>; for truly, this is their great Deſire, that <hi>ſuch</hi> may ſurvive them, who ſhall be counted to the Lord, for a <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration</hi>; yea, that the Name of the Lord may have <hi>Glory</hi> from the Children of Men, even unto <hi>all</hi> Generations.</p>

And furthermore, ſuppoſe the Lord ſhould not utterly abandon you for your <hi>preſent</hi> Neglect, yet you'l certainly find it much more difficult, to ceaſe to do evil, and to learn to do well, hereafter; for, repeated Acts ſtrengthen the Habits of Sin daily, more and more: It will <hi>never</hi> be <hi>ſo eaſy</hi> to repent and turn to the Lord, <hi>as now.</hi>

                     <p n="1">(1.)

But don't miſtake me, for I don't intend, that <hi>all</hi> the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>God</hi> ſhall certainly live <hi>to Old-Age</hi>: Many, who are regenerate, without Doubt, die in their <hi>Infancy</hi>; and other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Ones have been taken out of the World in their <hi>Childhood,</hi> ſoon after they were ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of expreſſing their Hatred of Sin, and their Love to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Commandments: Others in their <hi>Youth,</hi> ſoon after they have <hi>begun</hi> to ſerve God, and their Generation in the World. And thus it is, <hi>partly</hi> in Wrath, for the Puniſhment of the Ingratitude of a wicked World; and <hi>partly</hi> in Favour to themſelves; for God takes them away from the Evil to come, they having, thro' Grace, done the Work aſſigned them, and being ripe for Heaven.</p>
                     <p>Again: Neither do I intend, that <hi>all</hi> ſuch who live to <hi>Old-Age, are</hi> the <hi>Children of God</hi>: It is a <hi>ſad</hi> Truth, that ſome aged Perſons are

vain and wicked; the older they grow, the worſe they grow; as they advance in Years, and draw nearer to the Grave, they become more ripe for Deſtruction.
<q>
                           <hi>The Sinnner, tho' he live to be an hundred Years old, ſhall be accurſed</hi>; his living ſo long, ſhall be no Token to him of the divine Favour &amp; Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, nor ſhall it be any Shelter to him from the divine Wrath and Curſe; the Sentence he lies under will certainly be executed, and his long Life is but a long <hi>Reprieve</hi>: Nay, it is, itſelf, a Curſe to him, for the longer he lives, the more Wrath he trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures up againſt the Day of Wrath, and will have the more Sins to anſwer for.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>So that I don't intend, that the Children of God, and they only, ſhall certainly live to a great Age in this World; but my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that Life ſhall be enjoyed by them, <hi>ſo long,</hi> and ſo far as it ſhall be for God's Glory, and their Good; and that's eno', and as much as any well diſpoſed Perſon would deſire.

                     <p>But, you muſt obſerve, that I am ſpeaking, all this while, of the <hi>Grace</hi> of Contentment, as <hi>that</hi> which is <hi>enriching</hi>; for, there are ſome, who appear to be <hi>eaſy</hi> with their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, tho' it be but mean<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet are <hi>deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute</hi> of <hi>this Grace:</hi> Their Eaſineſs proceeds from Inconſideration, &amp; from a Spirit of Sloth and Careleſsneſs: They are a tho'tleſs Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; have not the Wiſdom of the <hi>Ant</hi>; but are rather like to the <hi>Horſe</hi> and <hi>Mule,</hi> which have no Underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>The Truth is, ſuch as are <hi>properly content,</hi> are diligent in their Buſineſs, according to their Ability; and well ſatisfied with the Portion which divine Providence curves out unto them: Theſe Men do certainly eye the Hand of God in all Things; and if God

gives them <hi>but little,</hi> yet they are thankful, as knowing that the Lord may do what he will with his own, and being ſenſible that they are leſs than the leaſt of all the Mercies of God.</p>
                     <p>Now certainly, ſuch a Man has a truly <hi>excellent Spirit,</hi> who can accommodate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to every Condition of Life, and carry an equal Temper of Mind thro' all the Vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſitudes of his State, ſaying, after the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> Phil. 4 11, 12. <hi>I have learned, in whatſoever State I am, therewith to be content</hi>; adding thoſe Words, in v. 13. <hi>I can do all Things thro' Chriſt, who ſtrengtheneth me.</hi>— And the Truth is, none may expect this <hi>Strength</hi> to be granted unto them, but thoſe <hi>who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote themſelves</hi> to the Service of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and profeſs to have their humble <hi>Dependance</hi> on him for <hi>Strength</hi> to <hi>enable</hi> them to perform their Duties in Sincerity, and to accept their Mercies thankfully, and to reſign their Wills to his Will, under all the Circumſtances of Life.</p>
                     <p>And among the Servants of the Lord, none may, on better Ground, expect to have this Strength granted to them, than thoſe who do <hi>betimes engage</hi> in the <hi>Exerciſes</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praiſe: God is good to Iſrael, to thoſe that are of a clean Heart</hi>; but eſpecially to thoſe who <hi>early</hi> ſeek his Face and Favour.

                     <p>And in a Word, HEAVEN will be <hi>your Portion</hi> if you <hi>now</hi> become the <hi>Lord's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi>; and this will be infinitely better than any Portion which your <hi>earthly Parents</hi> can poſſibly beſtow upon you.

                     </p>
                     <p>That <hi>your Children</hi> ſtand in <hi>abſolute need of Help</hi>; being born, not only deſtitute of the <hi>true</hi> Knowledge of <hi>God,</hi> and of his Son <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Way</hi> to Life by him; but alſo, full of <hi>Enmity</hi> againſt the <hi>Lord,</hi> and againſt his <hi>Chriſt.—They need,</hi> I ſay, to be inſtructed in, and to be excited to, their Duty, being, by Nature, both, blind, and obſtinate; wherefore, <hi>have Compaſſion</hi> on <hi>them,</hi> and <hi>help them</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreover, the <hi>Word of God</hi> obligeth us, <hi>as we have Opportunity to do Good to all, and eſpecially to the Houſhold of Faith</hi>; of which Houſhold <hi>your Children</hi> are. — But then, beſides this, <hi>Parents</hi> are <hi>expreſly com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>manded</hi> to <hi>train up their Children in the Way they ought to go; and to bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord</hi>;
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:004413_0049_100D505E1CACA320"/>
and conſequently, to uſe their utmoſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, to lead them unto <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to promote their ſerving of him, in an <hi>active</hi> Way—And truly, Parents are, not only, obliged hereunto by the Commandment of <hi>God,</hi> but alſo, by Vertue of <hi>their covenanting</hi> with the <hi>Lord</hi>; for, in the Face of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, we have ſolemnly <hi>promiſed</hi> to bring them up <hi>for him.</hi>—And I may add, that the <hi>Relation,</hi> which we bear to <hi>our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as Parents,</hi> is a very ſtrong Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon us, to lead them unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> — How can we be ſaid to do the Part of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents towards th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It cannot be: For, ſurely, it is not enough to provide them with Meat, Drink, and Cloathing; No; this is the leaſt and the eaſieſt Part of our Duty: We ought, eſpecially, to have at Heart, their ſpiritual and eternal Intereſt: Which, if we have, we ſhall certainly endeavour to lead them unto CHRIST; and ſhall teach them to eye, and ſubmit to him, as <hi>their</hi> Lord and Ruler, as well as <hi>their</hi> Saviour.</p>
                     <p>Furthermore, conſider, that they <hi>ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin</hi> to be <hi>capable</hi> of receiving ſome Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>Things</hi> of <hi>God</hi> Indeed, if they were deſtitute of a Capacity to receive Light and Knowledge, then, we might be juſtified in our Neglect; but the Caſe is not ſo; and therefore, we can never anſwer it,

either to God, or our own Conſciences; no, nor indeed, to <hi>our Children</hi> themſelves, if we ſhall diſregard their ſpiritual and eternal Welfare. Know we not, that if we neglect to promote the ſame, and <hi>our Children</hi> ſhould die in their Iniquity, then <hi>God</hi> will require their Blood at our Hands: But, on the other Side, if we diſcharge our Duty towards them, then, we ſhall deliver our own Souls; yea, notwithſtanding they continue impenitent, and die in their Sins.—And it may, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, be of Service, and for <hi>our</hi> quickening, ſeriouſly to conſider after this Manner, <hi>viz. Suppoſe a Child of our's, come to Years of Underſtanding, and whoſe Soul we have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected to take Care of, ſhould be taken away from us by Death</hi>; How could we, at ſuch a Time, bear up under ſuch a Thought as <hi>this, viz.</hi> I was the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> of this Child's Being, and the <hi>next Cauſe</hi> of it's <hi>natural Guilt</hi> and <hi>Pollution,</hi> and yet, <hi>have not taken due Care,</hi> that ſo, it might become a <hi>Servant</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>ſee</hi> the <hi>Salvation</hi> of <hi>God</hi>?— Certainly, ſuch a Reflection as this would be very grievous indeed, and as a Sword in your Bones.—Wherefore, let us be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with, to endeavour, that there may not be any Occaſion for it.</p>

                     <p>In a Word; The <hi>beſt Good</hi> of <hi>our Children</hi> loudly calls upon us, to do our utmoſt, to bring them to ſerve the LORD JESUS CHRIST. —And ſeeing, he is <hi>honoured by,</hi> and <hi>plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with,</hi> ſuch <hi>Children,</hi> as are religiouſly diſpoſed, certainly, it becomes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us, <hi>to,</hi> and if we have any Ingenuity in us, we <hi>ſhall,</hi> endeavour, that they may be <hi>early</hi> devoted to him.</p>
                     <p>I come now to offer you a few Words, by Way of <hi>Counſel</hi> and DIRECTION, <hi>viz.</hi>

This is to lay up in ſtore againſt the Time to come: It is to put out Money to one of the beſt of Uſes.—<hi>Thanks</hi> be to <hi>God,</hi> that he has inclined <hi>many</hi> Perſons, in ſome Parts of the World, to diſpoſe of ſome of their Incomes, to ſerve <hi>this</hi> good Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, viz <hi>To ſupport</hi> CHARITY SCHOOLS, for the ſake of <hi>poor Children:</hi> And thro' the Favour of Heaven, we, in <hi>this Land,</hi> are not wholly deſtitute of ſuch Inſtances of Goodneſs and Kindneſs: And, in an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Manner, <hi>ſome good People</hi> in the Towns of BOSTON and SALEM, are ſaid to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary for expending Money for <hi>ſuch</hi> an Uſe: What <hi>they</hi> have done this Way is come abroad, and ſpoken of to their very great Honour, as alſo, to the Honour of our holy Religion, which hath had <hi>ſuch</hi> Effect upon them, as to move them to <hi>ſo</hi> good a

Work. The LORD think upon all ſuch for Good, who have encourag'd and promoted this good Thing, and have from Time to Time contributed on this good Deſign! May they be inclined to go on! And will the LORD be pleaſed to bleſs their Perſons, their Offspring, and their Subſtance; and may they live to ſee the good Effect of their Charity, with Reſpect to <hi>thoſe poor Children,</hi> on whom their Money has been, or may be, expended.</p>
                     <p>But then, I would ſay further, that Care ought to be taken, not only, that <hi>Children</hi> may be taught to read, but alſo, that they <hi>do</hi> read in the BIBLE, <hi>every Day.</hi> Let Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Maſters allow them Time for it and oblige them to obſerve it: Yea, and hear them read yourſelves, at leaſt, before your Family Prayers. And moreover, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they meet with a <hi>divine Sentence,</hi> which does, more eſpecially, relate to <hi>their</hi> Age, Station, or Condition, it may be of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Advantage, to <hi>obſerve</hi> it to them, and to <hi>call</hi> upon them, to <hi>keep it in Mind.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And not only ſo, but you muſt provide them with ſome good <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> that, they may be inſtructed in the firſt Principles of the Oracles of God, and the fundamental Articles of our holy Religion. That of the <hi>Aſſembly of Divines</hi> I ſhould moſt incline to recommend to you.
