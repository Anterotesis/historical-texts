            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HO' it be a little uncommon, to bring two Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Scripture, ſituated at ſuch a Diſtance in the Bible, for the Text or Argument of one Diſcourſe; yet as theſe Paſſages, not only have ſomething of a ſimilar Sound, but have generally been judg'd to have very much the ſame Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and as Expoſitors, however varying in their Comments on the one and the other, in Correſpondence to their differing Views of the Context, and their differing Schemes in Divinity, have nevertheleſs conſider'd them as nearly parallel Scriptures, of
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:006500_0004_10291416A2584C20"/>
much the ſame Import, and capable of the ſame Application and Uſe in Religion: therefore I have tho't it no Impropriety, to place them in Connection at the head of this Diſcourſe, in Order to compare them together, and diſcover the true Senſe of the one by that Light the other reflects upon it; by which Means we ſhall ſee how the <hi>Prophet</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and ſo how both the Old Teſtament and the New, concur in pouring Contempt on the perſonal <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of Man, and diſparaging all the moral Attainments, even of the <hi>Beſt,</hi> as well as Worſt of Mankind, under ſome limited Notions and Reſpects.</p>
            <p>Both of theſe Scriptures ſeem to have been miſerably tortur'd by <hi>Papiſtical</hi> and other Writers, to pervert 'em to a falſe Senſe, and a wrong and dangerous Uſe: while yet, in a fair and equitable Conſtruction, they appear ſubſervient to ſome of the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Purpoſes in Religion; to humble the fallen Creature, and exalt the bleſſed Redeemer; to rout all the vain Pretences of ſelf-righteous Mortals; to conduct Sinners to Chriſt, as <hi>the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs unto every one that believeth;</hi> and to excite the <hi>Juſt</hi> to <hi>live by Faith, doing all in the Name of Chriſt,</hi> while <hi>careful to maintain good Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Prophet ISAIAH (as <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in general have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood and apply'd his Words) by the Spirit foreſeeing ſome future great Revolution in the Church, compoſes a prophetical Prayer, wherein this holy Man in the Name of the Converts of <hi>Zion</hi> makes that lowly Confeſſion, <hi>All our Righteouſneſſes are as filthy Rags.</hi> And the Apoſtle PAUL, for himſelf (but therein exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting the <hi>communis Senſus Fidelium,</hi> the genuine Sentiment and Spirit of every true Chriſtian) after having confeſſed in relation to Time paſt, that he had <hi>counted all Things but Loſs, for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the Knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> ſubjoins this further Confeſſion referring to the Time preſent, <hi>And I do count them but Dung, that I may win Chriſt, and be found in him, not having mine own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which is of the Law.</hi>—</p>
            <p>It appears to me the principal Scope, as well of the Prophet, as the Apoſtle, to renounce all Pretenſions to <hi>Juſtification by Works,</hi> and diſavow every Plea from <hi>righteous Self</hi> in point of reconciling or ingratiating Worthineſs before the Sovereign Lawgiver; to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim <hi>Self-Righteouſneſs</hi> in every Shape, and reject all Tho'ts of <hi>ſtanding in the Judgment,</hi> upon the foot of perſonal Obedience to God's Law, the everlaſting Rule of <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi>— They both uſe ſtrong and emphatical Language, that diſcovers a profound Senſe of the abſolute Inſufficiency of the beſt <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:006500_0005_102913CDDD68BF60"/>
Men, for the purpoſe of intitling them to the ſpecial Mercy of God. It ſeems, taking their Words in ſuch a Reference, they both with equal Expreſſions of a juſt Contempt and generous Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain explode <hi>their own Righteouſneſs,</hi> as altogether inadequate and unavailable to ſo great a Deſign: the one reſembling it to <hi>filthy Rags,</hi> and the other to loathſome <hi>Dung.</hi> (I ſtay not to criticiſe on the Tranſlation, nor mention the Variety of ſuppos'd Alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Original.) <hi>Self-Righteouſneſs</hi> in all it's Forms and Appearances ſtands condemn'd and vilify'd here. Even the Saints moſt perfect <hi>Works of Righteouſneſs</hi> as reſpected under certain reſtrictive Conſiderations, are all thus depreciated by the inſpir'd Prophet and Apoſtle, yea, have a deep Diſgrace thrown upon them by theſe homely and contemptuous Simile's.— We have exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify'd here the agreeing humble Confeſſions both of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church and <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and the Harmony of the Saints of every Age in <hi>acknowledging the Truth which is after Godlineſs.</hi>— This is the View I have of theſe Scriptures, after diligent and impartial Inquiry into their true Meaning: and in this, I think, I have the concurrent Suffrage of the Body of reform'd Churches and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.— However, let us now recollect the varying Gloſſes of Commentators and Preachers upon theſe Words, and a little exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine into their ſeveral Grounds and Reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I obſerve, ſome interpret both the <hi>Prophet</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> as ſpeaking only of a <hi>Phariſaical</hi> or meer <hi>external Righteouſneſs:</hi> and according to them, 'tis at moſt but a <hi>Form of Godlineſs</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Power, or ſome Shew of moral Virtue without the Reality, that is here repreſented in ſuch Terms of Reproach.— Yet, as there are different Degrees of <hi>Phariſaiſm,</hi> and Hypocriſy appears in a Variety of Figures, theſe Interpreters, thô agreeing in the general Sentiment, are divided about the particular Application of it, and go into a various Latitude of Thought.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There are thoſe who ſo reſtrain the Meaning of theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as to ſuppoſe them applicable only to the Caſe of <hi>groſſer Hypocrites:</hi> whoſe feigned <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> they willingly grant, deſerves no better Name than that of <hi>Dung,</hi> or <hi>filthy Rags.</hi>— They own, the Scriptures every where paint the conſcious and deſigning Hypocrite in Characters of Ignominy; and pronounce the <hi>Sacrifices of the Wicked,</hi> thô pretending to be <hi>Sacrifices of Righteouſneſs,</hi> an <hi>Abomination to the Lord.</hi> To this Purpoſe they apply thoſe Divine Paſſages,— <hi>Bring no more vain Oblations;—I hate, I deſpiſe your Feaſt-Days;— Is it ſuch a Faſt that I have choſen? —I will declare thy Righteouſneſs, and thy Works; for they ſhall not

profit thee.— Your Webs ſhall not become Garments, neither ſhall you cover yourſelves with your Works: Your Works are Works of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> &amp;c.—They own, the moſt ſpecious Profeſſion and Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Religion, with the Shew of Virtue in ſome Inſtances, which Men put on for a <hi>Cloke of Covetouſneſs,</hi> for a Maſk to cover their wicked Luſts, and recommend themſelves to the good Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the World, if not alſo to ingratiate themſelves with the bleſſed God, and as it were compound with him for their Sins; all ſuch pretended <hi>Righteouſnſſes,</hi> I ſay, they own to be wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly defective, corrupt and polluted, worthy of the moſt inglorious Names, in the View of the Heart-ſearching Judge, and of enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd Conſcience in reflecting Penitents. This is what ſome contend to be the whole Amount (particularly) of the <hi>Prophet's</hi> Confeſſion in our Text; as if he only had in his Eye the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſes</hi> (falſely ſo called) of the vileſt Hypocrites, who <hi>feign themſelves to be juſt Men,</hi> while yet in Truth (and for that Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) they are to be rank'd among the very worſt of <hi>wicked</hi> Men.</p>
            <p>In this very confin'd Senſe, the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in particular underſtands the <hi>Prophet's</hi> Words, rejecting the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Senſe with deep Indignation; and that, as they think, upon ſufficient Grounds in Scripture and Reaſon, the moſt plauſible of which I will now produce and endeavour to refute.

               <hi>old Proteſtants</hi> for an infallible Standard of Orthodoxy; yet, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out more convincing Reaſons than any their Opponents have ever offer'd, I ſhould be loth ſo much as to ſeem to betray their Cauſe or to reflect on their Memory, by giving up ſo notable a Text, which <hi>they triumph'd in &amp; always had in their Mouths,</hi> into the Hands of their <hi>Popiſh</hi> Adverſaries. However, it may not be amiſs, to hear the Grounds of the PAPIST'S judging this Text impertinently alledg'd, and what the <hi>Reformers</hi> ſay in their own Defence.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romiſh</hi> Champion aſſigns <q>
                  <hi>three</hi> Reaſons, (1.) Becauſe undoubtedly <hi>Iſaiah</hi> do's not ſpeak of righteous Men, but <hi>(de inſignibus Peccatoribus)</hi> of remarkably <hi>wicked</hi> Men.</q>— To invalidate which, the PROTESTANT replies; Certainly this Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was no ſuch <hi>wicked</hi> Man, and he includes <hi>himſelf,</hi> together with other pious Perſons in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when in the Name of the Church he preſents this humble Confeſſion to God, <hi>All</hi> OUR <hi>Righteouſneſſes are as filthy Rags.</hi> Nor is there any Thing here confeſs'd, more than is imply'd in this ſame Prophet's humble Words on a former Occaſion, (Chap. 6.) <hi>I am a Man of unclean Lips, and dwell in the midſt of a People of unclean Lips.</hi> And the PROTESTANT further argues, they can't be profligate Sinners, who are perſonated by the Prophet in this Confeſſion, becauſe none ſuch can truly (in the Senſe intended) plead as in the Context, <hi>Doubtleſs thou art our Father;—Thou, O Lord, art our Father, our Redeemer,— Return for thy Servants ſake— We are thine—We ſhall he ſaved—Now, O Lord, thou art our Father— We are the Work of thy Hand,</hi> &amp;c. Nevertheleſs the PAPIST attempts by ſeveral Conſiderations, to ſupport and ſtrengthen this his firſt Reaſon why the Prophet ſhould be thought to ſpeak in the Perſon of very <hi>wicked</hi> Men. As, "(1.) Becauſe in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Context he had ſaid, <hi>Behold thou art wroth, and we have ſinned.</hi>" But the PROTESTANT ſees no Force of Argument in this. For no Man liveth and <hi>ſinneth not;</hi> and God is <hi>angry</hi> at Sin, wherever he ſeeth it: He keeps his own Children under a holy Diſcipline, while in this World, and often chaſtiſes the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous for their ſinful Failings, with a fatherly Diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>The PAPIST adds, <q>(2.) It is plain that the Prophet ſpeaks in the Perſon of the <hi>Wicked,</hi> from thoſe Words in the following Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, <hi>There is none that calleth upon thy Name, There is none that riſeth up and taketh Hold on Thee.</hi>
               </q> But the PROTESTANT reply's, The Righteous are liable to a ſad Decay of Faith and Prayer; and indeed in the Prayers of the Saints, at beſt, there's always too little of Love and Zeal to the <hi>Name of the Lord,</hi> and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006500_0008_1029141D6BD373B0"/>
too little of a <hi>ſtirring up themſelves to take hold on God:</hi> So that in the Account of God's Law and ſtrict rectoral Holineſs, their Prayers are as it were <hi>no</hi> Prayers, and at leaſt very frequently are ſuch as ſcarce deſerve the Name even in the Account of Goſpel-Grace: Yea, for a Seaſon there may be ſo much of Formality and Deadneſs in their praying, as that God interprets it a <hi>not calling on his Name,</hi> a <hi>not taking Hold of him;</hi> and when Conſcience is awaken'd in his backſliding Children, they charge themſelves with vile Deficiency in the Duties of Faith and Prayer, they cenſure and humble themſelves for the <hi>Iniquity of their holy Things,</hi> as the Root of all their Defection, and a juſt Reaſon of their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father's correcting them.— The PAPIST ſubjoins,</p>
            <p n="3">
               <q>(3) The Scripture every where ſpeaks <hi>honorably</hi> of the Works of <hi>righteous</hi> Men, and aſſerts their being <hi>well pleaſing</hi> to God, as a <hi>ſweet ſmelling</hi> Savour: and in this very Chapter <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſays, <hi>Thou meeteſt him that rejoyceth and worketh Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</q> Hence (the <hi>Jeſuite</hi> concludes) <q>none can ſuppoſe him to call the <hi>Righteouſneſſes</hi> of Saints <hi>filthy Rags;</hi> unleſs any one be ſo <hi>doating</hi> as to imagine that <hi>naſty</hi> Things are pleaſing to God, and that <hi>filthy Rags</hi> are a ſweet Odour to him who is the Fountain of <hi>Purity.</hi>
               </q> But to this the PROTESTANT reply's, that the Saints Works of Righteouſneſs are not conſider'd <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,</hi> when honour'd with theſe Eulogies, nor are accepted for their own intrinſick Dignity, Purity and Perfection: But they have their Eſtimate, in the Court of governing Grace, from the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Principle of <hi>Faith,</hi> which is the ſpring of them, and are valu'd for the ſake of the pleaſing <hi>Mediator,</hi> in whoſe <hi>Name</hi> they are perform'd, with whoſe <hi>Blood</hi> they are ſprinkled and cleanſed, and with the ſweet Incenſe of whoſe <hi>Merits</hi> they are perfum'd. Whereas, ſtrictly in themſelves conſider'd and view'd in the Glaſs of the Law, they are full of Imperfection and moral Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; inſomuch that they can't be call'd <hi>good</hi> Works, but in very <hi>lax</hi> Language, and in a <hi>comparative</hi> Senſe.

                  <hi>(quantum ad Veritatem, bonum noſtrum non eſt bonum)</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Verity</hi> itſelf, <hi>our</hi> good Works are <hi>not</hi> good.</q> Agreably St. AUGUSTINE ſaith well, <q>If God would deal with us ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our good Deſervings, he would find in us <hi>Nothing but what he might condemn.</hi>
               </q> So again he ſaith, <q>Our <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> in this Life conſiſts rather in the <hi>Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> than in the <hi>Perfection of Virtues.</hi>
               </q>— Indeed the Saints beſt moral <hi>Ornaments,</hi> that in the Account of Goſpel-Grace are <hi>of great Price in the Sight of God,</hi> nevertheleſs in the Eye of the Law have ſo much of real Deformity and Impurity attending them, as might juſtly make them an ungrateful Spectacle to a holy God, and a very <hi>Stench in his Noſtrils;</hi> yea, that would actually be the Caſe, were it not for the <hi>Blood of Sprinkling</hi> and <hi>the Robe of</hi> imputed <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> that cleanſes and covers all. Hence, as the Perſons of the Saints are ſaid to be <hi>made accepted in the Beloved,</hi> ſo their <hi>ſpiritual Sacrifices</hi> to be <hi>acceptable to God thro' Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is not any Virtue or Value in their Perſons or Services, abſolutely conſider'd, that commends them to God and makes them delec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in his Sight: but it's the Mediation of Chriſt, in whom they have believed and in whom they are view'd as cloathed with his <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> that procures them all their Acceptance and Approbation in the Eyes of God. Hence that Speech of BASIL, a primitive Father, <q>
                  <hi>This</hi> is our whole &amp; full <hi>rejoycing in God,</hi> while we confeſs our ſelves <hi>deſtitute of all Righteouſneſs of our own,</hi> that we are <hi>juſtified by only Faith in Chriſt.</hi>
               </q> And that ſaying of JEROM, another of the Fathers, <q>In <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> our Lord, in whom we have Boldneſs, and Acceſs (to God) and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence thro' the <hi>Faith</hi> of him: <hi>not thro' our Righteouſneſs,</hi> but <hi>thro' Him</hi> in whoſe Name our Sins be forgiven.</q> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Cited by Bp JEWEL, <hi>ubi ſupra.</hi>
               </note> So then, altho' the Prophet had juſt before ſaid in his Prayer, <hi>Thou meeteſt him that rejoyceth and worketh Righteouſneſs,</hi> this carries in it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all of real Inconſiſtency with the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Gloſs on his following Confeſſion, <hi>All our Righteouſneſſes are as filthy Rags:</hi> Nor does it afford <hi>Papiſts</hi> the leaſt Shadow of an Argument in favour of their Hypotheſis, that the Prophet makes this humble Confeſſion in the Perſon of the <hi>Wicked.</hi> Indeed, the <hi>rejoycing</hi> ſpoken of, is a <hi>rejoycing in</hi> GOD our Saviour, ſaying (as in Context) <hi>Thou art our Redeemer:</hi> Or a <hi>glorying in the Lord,</hi> after that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which this Prophet deſcribes it (Chap. 45.17.) <hi>Surely ſhall one ſay, In the Lord have I Righteouſneſs and Strength.</hi> 'Tis
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006500_0010_1029141F0C622698"/>
the Language of <hi>Faith:</hi> and this is an operative obedientia Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. <hi>Faith worketh by Love;</hi> and by <hi>Faith,</hi> the Saints of every Age have <hi>wrought Righteouſneſs.</hi> Yet 'tis equally a Principle of <hi>Humility,</hi> laying the Saint low in his own Eyes, and teaching him to entertain low Tho'ts of his own <hi>Works of Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let the POPISH Diſputant go on. <q>Nor ought it to move us (ſays he) tho' <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſeems to ſpeak to <hi>generally,</hi> as to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend <hi>all</hi> Men: becauſe this is the Manner of Scripture, to ſpeak of <hi>many,</hi> as if it were <hi>all.</hi>
               </q>— However, to this the PROTESTANT has an eaſy Reply to make. Neither the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of Faith, nor any Thing in the Context, obliges us to conſtrue the Term of <hi>Univerſality</hi> here in a limited Senſe, as extending only to the <hi>Wicked,</hi> in Excluſion of the Righteous. But on the contrary, as there are very apparent Grounds in the Context, to ſuppoſe the Prophet's making this Prayer in the Perſon of the <hi>Righteous,</hi> and conſequently <hi>their</hi> making the Confeſſion, in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; ſo our Imputation of it to them is juſtifiable, by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Repreſentations of the Saints preſent State of moral Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and by a Variety of parallel Examples both in the Old and New Teſtament. For we often find the Righteous lamenting the Defects and Defilements of their <hi>Works of Righteouſneſs,</hi> as well as deploring the Interruption of their Obedience by <hi>Works of Wickedneſs:</hi> and accordingly crying to God for pardoning and ſparing Mercy, with earneſt Deprecations of a judicial proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt them. I might inſtance in <hi>Job,</hi> that perfect and upright Man, and refer you to many Paſſages of his, to this purpoſe. So in <hi>David,</hi> the Man after God's own Heart, who abounds with Expreſſions, of this Import, in his Pſalms. And in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> in <hi>Paul,</hi> with many other Saints on Scripture-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. But the Time would fail me. There are a Multitude of the Saints Confeſſions, whoſe Language implies nothing ſhort of this in the Text, <hi>All our Righteouſneſſes are as filthy Rags.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed, ſays the PAPIST, <q>Another Reaſon is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe tho' <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſhould ſpeak of <hi>all,</hi> i. e. of that whole People, yet he did not ſpeak of all for <hi>every</hi> Time, but <hi>only</hi> for <hi>that</hi> Time when for their conſummate <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> they were doom'd to Captivity in <hi>Babylon.</hi>
               </q>— To which the PROTESTANT anſwers: This Prayer of inſpir'd <hi>Iſaiah</hi> is indeed prophetical, and reſpects a future Time, perhaps in particular that of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, or as ſome think, the Times of the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> But ſtill it contains many Things of a <hi>common</hi> Reference, or <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Aſpect; and the Confeſſion in our Text is accommodable to <hi>all</hi> Times of the Church indifferently. For it is founded on
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006500_0011_102913D56DE0BC58"/>
a melancholy Truth, equally applicable to every Age, as to that in which <hi>Solomon</hi> lived, <hi>There is not a juſt Man upon Earth, who doeth Good, and ſinneth not,</hi> even in his <hi>good</hi> Deeds themſelves, as to the Manner of doing them. Nor it there <hi>any</hi> Time but the Challenge which he makes in <hi>his</hi> Day, may on the ſame Grounds be repeated; <hi>Who can ſay, I have made my Heart clean; I am pure from my Sin!</hi> So the Challenge may be apply'd to the Men of every Generation, as well as of that to which <hi>David</hi> belong'd; <hi>Who can underſtand his Errors?</hi> Nor are there any but what at all Times have Occaſion to pray with him, <hi>Cleanſe me from ſecret Faults.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The PAPIST adds, <q>A third Reaſon is, becauſe <hi>Iſaiah</hi> do's not ſpeak of <hi>all the Works</hi> even of the Wicked, but only of thoſe which they imagined to be <hi>Righteouſneſſes;</hi> ſuch as their <hi>Sacrifices, New-Moons,</hi> and <hi>Rituals</hi> of Worſhip, wherein they eſpecially placed <hi>Righteouſneſs:</hi> which Obſervances indeed, for want of being done with a right Intention and in due Manner, are deſervedly compar'd to <hi>filthy Rags.</hi>
               </q>— But to this the PROTESTANT replies; that there is no Colour for ſuch a Limitation; for the Prophet ſpeaks in <hi>indefinite</hi> Language, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is of <hi>univerſal</hi> Extent, without any Exception or Reſerve, ALL <hi>our Righteouſneſſes are as filthy Rags.</hi> Agreably I find that Note made upon theſe Words by Bp JEWEL, an eminent old Reformer: <note n="†" place="bottom">Ser. at the End of his Works, Pag. 215.</note> 
               <q>Our <hi>Virtue,</hi> our <hi>Holineſs,</hi> our Faſtings, our Prayers, are <hi>filthy,</hi> when they come to GOD'S Sight.</q> And it's the famous Dr. WILLET'S Obſervation on the Text: <note n="‡" place="bottom">Synop. Pap. p. 1028, and 1210.</note> 
               <q>The <hi>beſt</hi> Works we do are ſomewhat <hi>defiled</hi> with our own Corruption.— The Prophet's Words are <hi>general;</hi> ALL, <hi>i. e.</hi> whether the Righteouſneſs of the <hi>moral</hi> or the <hi>ceremonial</hi> Law. The <hi>moſt righteous</hi> Men in the Earth (ſays he) have not only their Infirmities, and are in Danger to ſin daily, but even their <hi>beſt</hi> and <hi>moſt holy</hi> Works are blemiſhed with ſome Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and have a Smack of Sin.</q>— Thus the old <hi>Proteſtants</hi> apply'd our Text to the Saints themſelves, and to <hi>all</hi> their Works, their very <hi>pureſt</hi> Works, even of <hi>Morality,</hi> as well as Ceremony.— However, ſhould we grant what is contended for, that they at moſt concern only unregenerate <hi>Sinners,</hi> it do's not appear, that ſuch have always been wont to place <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> in <hi>Rituals,</hi> more than in <hi>Morals.</hi> We find, in that Parable, intended for
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006500_0012_1029142239532FA8"/>
the Conviction of <hi>certain which truſted in themſelves that they were righteous,</hi> our LORD who knoweth the Hearts of all Men, deſcribes the <hi>Phariſee</hi> boaſting of his <hi>moral</hi> Attainments, as well as cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial Obſervances, and placing them to the Account of his <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi> Yea, it's obſervable, our <hi>Popiſh</hi> Adverſary him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf elſewhere <note n="*" place="bottom">BELLARM. <hi>de Juſtif.</hi> p. 90, 91.</note> has in Effect, by large Conceſſions, given up the Plea he makes here. Thus, in explaining that <hi>Righteouſneſs of the Law</hi> which the Scriptures ſhut out of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> he produces ſeveral Texts, where he tells us, "<hi>Works</hi> are excluded <hi>ſimply,</hi> without any Mention of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Law." And, however in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtently with his Argument before us, he expreſly makes the following remarkable Conceſſion. <q>The Apoſtle having to do (ſays he) not only with Jews, but alſo with <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that boaſted of their <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> no leſs than the Jews did of their Law, We [of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>] therefore underſtand him <hi>abſolutely</hi> to exclude <hi>all Works,</hi> antecedent to <hi>Faith,</hi> as well the Obſervation of <hi>Morals,</hi> as of Ceremonies.</q>— By the <hi>Cardinal's</hi> Leave then, interpreting the <hi>Prophet</hi>'s Confeſſion by the Apoſtle's allow'd Doctrine, we may fairly extend the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of <hi>filthy Rags</hi> to <hi>all Righteouſneſſes,</hi> of a <hi>moral</hi> Complexion, as well as ritual. And it follows too, by the ſame Rule of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſince he grants <hi>all Works</hi> indifferently (previous to <hi>Faith</hi>) are rejected, he ought not to have confin'd the <hi>Prophet</hi>'s Idea in the Text to the Works of very <hi>wicked</hi> Men, or groſs Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, that did but practiſe a little Religion meerly <hi>in Pretence,</hi> in wilful Diſguiſe and with conſcious Diſſimulation; <hi>all</hi> Hypocrites and Sinners in <hi>Zion</hi> not being of ſo abandon'd a Character.</p>
            <p>Nor ſurely may this be allow'd to have been the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s View and Meaning in <hi>his</hi> part of our Text. For it can't with the leaſt Colour of Reaſon be pretended, that <hi>he</hi> is perſonating the <hi>worſt</hi> of <hi>wicked</hi> Men; ſince he is here in the directeſt Language ſpeaking of <hi>himſelf</hi> ſingly: and he never confeſs'd himſelf ſuch a foul Diſſembler with God or Man, as the vicious and deſigning Hypocrite; no, but on the contrary, we find him almoſt on all Occaſions vindicating his moral Character from ſo black a Slur, and even in our Context claiming to have been always an unſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Example of human Sincerity in his <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Profeſſion and Practice: nevertheleſs even this honeſt moral <hi>Jew</hi> here reports of himſelf, that when commencing a <hi>chriſtian</hi> Convert, he counted all his <hi>Phariſaical Righteouſneſs,</hi> tho' ſo untainted, ſo exemplary
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006500_0013_102913D7433C1448"/>
and reſpectable, but as <hi>Loſs</hi> and <hi>Dung,</hi> for Chriſt's Sake. Now doubtleſs, as there were ſome other <hi>Phariſees</hi> in his Day alike <hi>undiſſembling</hi> as he, to all whoſe <hi>Righteouſneſſes</hi> the ſame Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Diſgrace were equally due: ſo there might be ſeveral like Inſtances of <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Morality, in the Jewiſh Church, at the Time <hi>Iſaiah</hi> refers to in his prophetical Prayer, which contains this humble Confeſſion, <hi>All our Righteouſneſſes are as filthy Rags:</hi> a Confeſſion ſurely no leſs ſuitable for the moſt <hi>moral</hi> Hypocrite among them, than was that of <hi>Saul</hi> the Phariſee, for himſelf. It appears quite unreaſonable then, to underſtand the Prophet as only ſpeaking in the Perſon of the groſsly <hi>wicked;</hi> ſince his Words are as well applicable to <hi>others,</hi> of a fairer Carriage and even the moſt unblemiſh'd Appearance.</p>
            <p>Upon ſuch Conſiderations, I obſerve,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Generality of <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Interpreters have extended theſe degrading Compariſons in our Text to <hi>all the Righteouſneſſes</hi> of the moſt <hi>refined Hypocrites</hi> (at leaſt) without excepting the Caſe of any the exacteſt Moraliſt, or moſt rais'd Devotioniſt, ſtill unregenerate.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Prophet</hi>'s Confeſſion, 'tis commonly judg'd by PRO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TESTANT Writers, that he is here prophetically addreſſing the Throne of Grace in the <hi>Church</hi>'s Name, at ſome Seaſon of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Awakning and Reformation. And if they be conſider'd as now reflecting on their former Doings in Religion, previous to their Converſion, it is acknowledg'd, the Language of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion here is but what became <hi>ſelf-judging</hi> Penitents, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is uſual with ſuch. For true Goſpel-Penitents are wont to <hi>bluſh</hi> and even <hi>loath themſelves</hi> at the Remembrance of thoſe very Devotions and Virtues of theirs, which they once <hi>prided</hi> themſelves in; vainly Dreaming they would make their Perſons beauteous and amiable in the Sight of God, as well as Man, and would ſerve for a compleat <hi>Robe of Righteouſneſs,</hi> in which they might ſtand with Safety before the King of Glory: but now, convinc'd of their manifold Imperfections and Pollutions, their Contrariety to the Rule of Duty in many Regards, and their Shortneſs of it in all, they lament them as <hi>formally evil,</hi> however good materially, and even <hi>deſpiſe</hi> and <hi>renounce</hi> them in Relation to any ſuch Purpoſe as that of a <hi>juſtifying Righteouſneſs.</hi> In this Light, they can now look upon their once-boaſted <hi>Robe of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> no otherwiſe indeed than as <hi>filthy Rags:</hi> defective as <hi>Rags,</hi> or like ſome torn and ſcanty Garment, inſufficient to cover their moral Nakedneſs; and corrupt as <hi>filthy Rags,</hi> like a ſordid dirty beſmear'd (as well as tatter'd) Garment, rather polluting to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006500_0014_10291425CC019BC0"/>
them, than beautifying and recommending in the Eyes of their Heart-ſearching and Sin-hating Sovereign, while viewing them in the Glaſs of his holy <hi>Law.</hi>

            <p>Certainly our <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> in <hi>his</hi> Confeſſion before us, muſt be own'd an Example of this ſelf-condemning and ſelf-abhorring Frame of Mind; if we only conſider him as therein reſpecting his former unregenerate Life. For, <hi>after the ſtraiteſt Sect of the Jews Religion</hi> he had <hi>lived a Phariſee,</hi> and <hi>his Manner of Life from his Youth, as touching the Righteouſneſs which is in the Law, blameleſs;</hi> yea, exhibiting a notable <hi>Zeal towards God</hi> (thô not according to Knowledge) and much of Care to keep a <hi>Conſcience void of Offence</hi> towards Men.— However, afterwards upon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection being convinc'd that he all this While had not <hi>the Faith of God</hi>'s <hi>Elect,</hi> that Faith <hi>without</hi> which 'tis <hi>impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> he therefore now, ſince his having it given him to believe in God with a <hi>Faith unfeigned,</hi> revokes his <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Pretenſion to being <hi>juſtified by Works,</hi> and cenſures all his old <hi>Righteouſneſſes</hi> as deeply deficient, deprav'd, and even deteſtable in the Sight of God that juſtifieth; however inculpable in the View of ſhort-ſighted Men, and in the Eye of his own miſguided Conſcience. He now ſees and confeſſes, that notwithſtanding the laudable Conſiſtence of his viſible Actions and the uniform Tenor of his Behaviour in the World, under the Influences of natural Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, excited and improv'd by a religious Education, his paſt Life had been polluted with Abundance of moral Evils, thô of a more refin'd Sort; and that his very beſt Duties (whether of the ceremonial, or moral Kind) had all been vitiated by <hi>Unbelief</hi> and <hi>ſecret Hypocriſy,</hi> wretchedly defective and corrupt therefore in a juſt <hi>Theological</hi> View, and now appearing to his inlighten'd Eyes worthy the Name of <hi>Loſs</hi> and <hi>Dung</hi> it ſelf. He now own's that he had all the Days of his <hi>Phariſee-Life</hi> been, as it were, but patching up <hi>filthy Rags</hi> for a Coat of Armour againſt the <hi>fiery Law,</hi> or (to keep to his own Metaphor) but heaping up <hi>Dung</hi> for a Defence againſt the Juſtice of the divine Lawgiver; and that a holy God might juſtly have <hi>ſpread Dung upon his Face</hi> (as the Prophet ſpeaks) <hi>even the Dung of his ſolemn Feaſts</hi> and Faſts, of his heartleſs Devotions and lifeleſs Vertues: All which he now renounces with a deſerv'd Contempt and no longer places his <hi>Righ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Indeed, there are Interpreters, that from ſuch a View as they've taken of the preceeding Context, do ſuppoſe him in our Text but to renounce <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> as ſuch; to diſclaim that <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:006500_0015_102913D8EE88C010"/>
which was <hi>his own</hi> as under the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law; his <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> which he had as a <hi>Jew</hi> and a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> or a ſtrict Conformiſt to the Rituals of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Diſpenſation. They think, now he was become a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> he might very well undervalue this as <hi>Loſs,</hi> yea, deſpiſe it as <hi>Dung,</hi> in Compare with that more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>Goſpel-Righteouſneſs,</hi> which he had ſince arriv'd to by the Knowledge of Chriſt and Obedience to the Faith.— But it is a Difficulty with them, to conceive how the Apoſtle ſhould count that Degree of <hi>moral</hi> Righteouſneſs he had attain'd, while a <hi>Jew,</hi> to be any <hi>Loſs</hi> or Prejudice and Damage to him: much leſs can they ſuppoſe his Renunciation of <hi>ritual</hi> Obſervan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces under the <hi>Law,</hi> fairly to be tranſlated to <hi>moral</hi> Attainments under the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> or juſtly to be conſider'd as inſtructing the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Profeſſor to count his Duties of Morality no better than <hi>Loſs</hi> and <hi>Dung.</hi> But this Difficulty ſeems to vaniſh, when we reflect, that theſe derogatory Names regard <hi>moral</hi> Works, not as <hi>abſolutely</hi> conſider'd, but under the relative Notion of a juſtifying <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and as a Man's truſting in them for <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> hinders him from <hi>ſubmitting to the Righteouſneſs of God by Faith,</hi> without doing which he hazards the Salvation of his Soul.</p>
            <p>However, there are others who judge the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s Example a proper Object of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s Imitation; and ſuppoſe thoſe Characters, odious as they are, which he apply's to <hi>his own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> whether in one View or another, juſtly transferrible to the moral Virtues of Men under a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Profeſſion, tho' the moſt ſubſtantial and ſublime, conſiſtent with an unregenerate State. They conclude the Text truly accommodable to the Caſe of a <hi>Goſpel-Phariſee;</hi> and ſcruple not applying to the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd Hypocrite's external Righteouſneſs (ritual, or moral) theſe depreciating Names of <hi>Loſs</hi> and <hi>Dung.</hi> For to this Caſe they think thoſe Sayings of CHRIST juſtly referrible, which ſhut all ſuch out of the heavenly Kingdom, <hi>whoſe Righteouſneſs exceeds not the Righteouſneſs of the</hi> Jewiſh <hi>Phariſees;</hi> and which charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſe theſe as but <hi>whited Sepulchres,</hi> while <hi>outwardly appearing righteous unto Men;</hi> yea, pronounce <hi>that which is highly eſteemed among Men</hi> even <hi>an Abomination in the Sight of God.</hi>— But then, of thoſe in this Way of thinking, there are <hi>ſome</hi> who can by no Means conſent to have ſuch a <hi>Stigma,</hi> as that in the <hi>Prophet's</hi> Confeſſion, apply'd to the <hi>real</hi> Righteouſneſſes of <hi>Saints,</hi> to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward vital Religion or true Holineſs, however imperfect. And be ſure they think it quite unlikely, that the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> tho' juſtly counting his <hi>Phariſaical Virtues,</hi> before Converſion, but <hi>Loſs</hi> or

Detriment <hi>for Chriſt,</hi> ſhould now after Converſion and when <hi>in Chriſt</hi> account his <hi>Evangelical Graces</hi> likewiſe ſtill but Detriment or <hi>Loſs,</hi> and very <hi>Dung:</hi> eſpecially as they don't obſerve, that the Writings of this Apoſtle, or other Parts of Scripture, any where elſe, repreſent true <hi>Goſpel-Holineſs</hi> under theſe debaſing Appellations, or any the like Characters of Diſcredit and Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution; but rather every where aſſerting its Utility, its Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, its Importance, yea, its abſolute Neceſſity and indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable Obligation, and conſtantly ſpeaking of the Believer's <hi>Works of Righteouſneſs</hi> in all the Language of Regard and Applauſe.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, there are <hi>other</hi> Divines, of equal Reputation for Piety, Learning and Judgment, who think they may conſiſtently carry the Senſe of the Text even to <hi>that</hi> Length; and ſuppoſing all Objections fairly anſwerable, do maintain, that both the <hi>Prophet</hi> and <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> when ſpeaking of ſuch <hi>Righteouſneſſes</hi> as were but like <hi>Dung</hi> and <hi>filthy Rags,</hi> did verily deſign <hi>their own</hi> real <hi>Righteouſneſſes,</hi> as ſincerely obedient Believers; and by Parity of Reaſon, the inherent <hi>Righteouſneſſes</hi> of all other Saints; ſo reflecting a Sort of Odium on all the perſonal <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of Man,— but this only under ſome particular Reſpects and with ſpecial Limitations, that they had in View.</p>
            <p>Which brings me to obſerve, under the other general Head,</p>
            <p n="2">II. Many pious judicious Expoſitors and Preachers, eſpecially in the firſt Times of the <hi>Reformation</hi> from <hi>Popery,</hi> have inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted both the <hi>Prophet</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> in our Text, as having their Eye more immediately to the perſonal <hi>Righteouſneſſes</hi> of real <hi>Saints,</hi> thô only under certain determinate Ideas and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining</hi> Conſiderations; and in thoſe particular limited Views, applying to <hi>true Holineſs</hi> itſelf, as ſubſiſting in and exerted by imperfect Men, the ignominious Names of <hi>Dung</hi> &amp; <hi>filthy Rags.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed I can't find that any of them do (<hi>as they be ſlanderouſly reported, and as ſome affirm that we ſay</hi> is the meaning) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand our Text, in one or other of it's Parts, to deny either the actual Exiſtence of all true Holineſs in Believers, or all Uſe and Advantage of it to them, or it's Neceſſity, or it's Obligation: And therefore don't underſtand them to ſtigmatiſe the Saints per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> unlimitedly, under every Conſideration of it. Accordingly when <hi>Proteſtants</hi> apply theſe Names of Reproach in our Text to true inherent <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> they never mean to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage it <hi>abſolutely</hi> and <hi>irreſpectively:</hi> No verily, but always in a reſtrain'd qualify'd Senſe only, as viewing it under certain

'Tis a known and approv'd Diſtinction, applicable in the preſent Caſe, that of <hi>dictum ſimpliciter &amp; ſecundum quid;</hi> and to argue from the latter to the former, thô too common in ill-natur'd Wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, is a Fallacy and Abuſe, which every fair Reaſoner will avoid with Scorn: Yet this is very much the Manner of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our <hi>Popiſh</hi> Adverſaries uſe with us, in their angry Debates upon the Meaning of our Text. Becauſe PROTESTANTS, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the ROMISH Error concerning <hi>Juſtification by Works,</hi> have alledg'd the Paſſages before us as aſſerting the Saints <hi>Works of Righteouſneſs</hi> to be all <hi>imperfect</hi> and <hi>polluted,</hi> tinctur'd with the Remains of innate Corruption, as well as interrupted with fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Commiſſions of Sin, all which <hi>defile the Man</hi> and debaſe his moral Character; from whence they judge it a neceſſary Conſequence, that <hi>ſuch Works</hi> can have no intrinſick Worth any Way equal to the Deſign of Men's <hi>Juſtification</hi> before God: therefore <hi>Papiſtical</hi> Writers, I find, make hideous Exclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt them, as abominably wreſting theſe Parts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and indeed contradicting the whole Tenor of the holy Bible: And theſe Writers having firſt miſrepreſented that as ſpoken <hi>ſimply</hi> and <hi>abſolutely,</hi> which Proteſtants ſay but <hi>compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively,</hi> or <hi>reſpectively</hi> to a particular Caſe, they then proceed to Charge the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Doctrine with many odious <hi>Abſurdities,</hi> and excuſe it not from <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> it ſelf. <note n="†" place="bottom">Vid.

            <p>But to ſupport theſe invidious and defamatory Charges, the very Champion of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Cauſe, with all his Powers of Reaſon and Treaſures of Learning, could only produce the moſt impotent Pleas (and none ſince ſeem to have produced any better) nor could offer ſo much as any Shew of Argument, that I can obſerve, beſides what is grounded on a palpably <hi>forc'd</hi> Senſe of the Text, and an evidently <hi>falſe</hi> Repreſentation of Fact, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Conſtruction and Uſe of it.— Neither have <hi>Proteſtants</hi> been wanting in the juſt Vindication of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt this diſingenuous and abuſive Treatment from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Adverſary: but have often appear'd in their own Defence, have ſtated and defended their Opinion without Diſguiſe and with ſuperior Strength of Reaſoning, ſolv'd all the Difficulties and Objections thrown in their Way, and ſaid abundantly enough for ever to ſilence the unreaſonable Clamour againſt them. I have thought therefore, it might anſwer a valuable End, that would richly compenſate the Labour, to review the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Controverſies on this Occaſion, and collect ſome Things (for a Specimen) out of thoſe large and excellent Defences, which <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have made long ago, of their Interpretation and Uſe of theſe Paſſages in our Text, againſt the Cavils and Crimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Jeſuitical</hi> Sophiſters; that if any under a <hi>Proteſtant</hi>

            <p>In the firſt Place then,</p>
            <p>As to that Part of our Text, <hi>All our Righteouſneſſes are as fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Rags,</hi> I find the PROTESTANT Application of this to the real <hi>Righteouſneſſes</hi> and moral Virtues of <hi>good</hi> Men exploded by PAPISTICAL Writers in general, and by ſome of 'em both ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cul'd as <hi>abſurd</hi> and curs'd as <hi>blaſphemous.</hi>—But the feigned Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy vaniſhes and the pretended Abſurdity diſappears, when <hi>Proteſtants</hi> come to make their Defence (as is commonly the Manner with them) by ſtating truly <hi>their</hi> Conſtruction and Uſe of the Text, by examining the <hi>Context,</hi> and <hi>comparing ſpiritual Things with ſpiritual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>According to the current Senſe of the <hi>Reformers</hi> (as already obſerv'd) the Prophet in our Text repreſents the <hi>Church of the living God</hi> (not the <hi>Wicked,</hi> as <hi>Papiſts</hi> imagine, but the <hi>Godly</hi>) making this humble Confeſſion, <hi>All our Righteouſneſſes are as filthy Rags.</hi> And the Doctrine they found upon it, is principally this: That the <hi>Saints,</hi> conſcious of remaining Corruption in themſelves, of many Sins ſtaining their Lives, and much moral Imperfection polluting and blemiſhing their very beſt Works, do therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all <hi>Dependance</hi> on their own perſonal <hi>Righteouſneſſes,</hi> for a <hi>Title to ſpecial Mercy</hi> and <hi>Juſtification before</hi> GOD; and in Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to ſuch a Purpoſe, do indeed account them but <hi>as filthy Rags.</hi>— The PROTESTANT Opinion is, that this undervaluing Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, in the Prophet's Intention, reaches to <hi>all Works,</hi> as well of a <hi>moral,</hi> as a ritual Aſpect, and as well <hi>ſubſequent,</hi> as antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to <hi>Faith.</hi> For ſince the faireſt Duties of <hi>Morality,</hi> even <hi>after</hi> Converſion, are not ſo pure and perfect, as to be intirely faultleſs before God, nor can <hi>atone</hi> for their own Faults or at all <hi>excuſe</hi> them, much leſs <hi>merit</hi> a Reward, but even need a <hi>Pardon</hi> of their immoral Defects, and leave us abſolutely dependent on the meritorious Obedience and propitiating Blood of the <hi>Mediator,</hi> for their <hi>Title</hi> to Acceptance and Approbation with God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore PROTESTANTS in old Time uſed to conclude, we may with the utmoſt Propriety and Pertinence extend this Character of <hi>filthy Rags</hi> further than to Works (ritual or moral) done <hi>before</hi> Converſion, and apply it to the very beſt Works of <hi>real</hi> Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,

            <p>However, to obviate a vulgar Prejudice, let it be noted here; while they thought the Saints moral <hi>Righteouſneſſes</hi> ſhut out of the <hi>Office of juſtifying</hi> (as they were wont to ſpeak) and as well from the Exigence of the Caſe, as in Honour to the <hi>Prieſtly</hi> Office of the Mediator, pleaded ſtrenuouſly for an <hi>imputed Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> even that which is of GOD thro' <hi>Faith</hi> only, as the ſole Ground, Matter, or objective Reaſon of <hi>Juſtification</hi> before God; yet ſtill (whatever their POPISH Adverſaries inſinuated, to blacken their Reputation and raiſe a Cloud on their Doctrine) the <hi>Reformers</hi> were as far as any in the World from caſting the leaſt Slight on the bleſſed SPIRIT in his Office as <hi>Sanctifier;</hi> but ever aſſerted the abſolute Neceſſity of ſubjective Grace (without which they deem'd Religion, in its moſt plauſible Appearances, but an empty Name) ever proclaim'd <hi>the Righteous</hi> more <hi>excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> than his Neighbour; and ever pronounc'd <hi>inherent</hi> Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs greatly <hi>beneficial,</hi> in its due Place, and in Relation to thoſe ſpecial <hi>Ends,</hi> for which the Goſpel requires it. They highly honour'd real <hi>Holineſs,</hi> as the Reſult of Divine Election, the Purchaſe of Chriſt, the Product of the Spirit, the Image of God, and the moral Glory of human Nature, the Evidence of a pardon'd State and the Earneſt of eternal Life, the Beginning of Heaven upon Earth, a ſure Principle of Happineſs to the Subjects of it, and a ſingular Bleſſing to the World. Nevertheleſs, in perfect Conſiſtency (as they thought) with all due Honours to it in every ſuch View, they conſtantly affirm'd this <hi>inherent Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> to be univerſally ſo imperfect in its Degree, attended with ſo many ſinful Failings in its daily Exertments, and allay'd with ſuch frequent groſſer Pollutions of Life, even in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteſt Saint here below, that it can by no Means ſufficiently an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the End of a <hi>reconciling</hi> and <hi>juſtifying Righteouſneſs,</hi> nor ſafely be confided in for a Title to God's ſpecial Mercy, or for Security againſt the Arreſts of his Law and Juſtice. Purſuant to this, they thought, that altho' as a Characteriſtick of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd and juſtify'd Man, and in point of Qualification or capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citating Diſpoſition for enjoying the Privileges of ſuch, as well as in regard of its Subſerviency to the Redeemer's Kingdom and Glory, moral Righteouſneſs be <hi>an Ornament of great Price in the Sight of God;</hi> yet ſtill, conſid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">

            <p>Indeed I find ſome later <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Expoſitors, for the ſake of obviating Prejudices and avoiding Difficulties, have choſen to put a <hi>perſonal</hi> Senſe on the Word <hi>Righteouſneſſes</hi> (ſuppoſing, by a Figure in Speech, the <hi>Abſtract</hi> put for the <hi>Concrete</hi>) and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Prophet to intend <hi>righteous Men,</hi> they think that by <hi>filthy Rags</hi> is only ſuggeſted the forlorn and abject <hi>Condition</hi> of God's People, at the Time this prophetical Prayer refers to.— But, reſerving all due Reſpects to the Inventors of this Conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I may modeſtly ſay, it ſeems rather ingenious, than ſolid and judicious: Nor ſee I the Neceſſity or Expediency of depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the commonly receiv'd Notion of the Text, which our <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Fathers, reforming from <hi>Popery,</hi> laid ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Weight upon, and made ſuch perpetual Uſe of <hi>(triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this Text,</hi> and <hi>having it ever in their Mouths)</hi> as furniſhing them with a very powerful Plea in Oppoſition to the PAPAL Doctrine of <hi>Juſtification by Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, it mayn't be improper to obſerve here, I find the PROTESTANT Writers commonly defending their <hi>general</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of this Scripture by explaining it in ſundry <hi>particular</hi> Senſes; and theſe are reducible to <hi>two,</hi> the one <hi>Comparative,</hi> and the other relative to <hi>Juſtification:</hi> which I ſhall now take ſome Notice of diſtinctly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They vindicate their applying the Character of <hi>filthy Rags</hi> to the moral <hi>Righteouſneſſes</hi> of Saints themſelves, by pleading that none will deny their deſerving this diſgraceful Name, if view'd in a <hi>comparative</hi> Light.— And 'tis certainly not unuſual in Scripture-Language, to call Things, in their Nature valuable, by <hi>diminutive</hi> Names, or put <hi>detracting</hi> Characters upon 'em, <hi>comparatively</hi> ſpeaking.

Beſure, when the Apoſtle was running down the Diſpenſation of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and applying to it ſome Terms of great Diſparagement, he explains himſelf by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Even that which was made glorious, had NO Glory in this Reſpect, by Reaſon of the Glory that excelleth.</hi>— So here, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's Confeſſion, I ſuppoſe, will by univerſal Conſent admit of a <hi>comparative</hi> Senſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:006500_0022_10291435D02CA000"/>Even <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as well as <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> agree, that the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted moral <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> in the World muſt appear but as <hi>impure Rags,</hi> if view'd in the infinitely tranſcendent Light of GOD'S <hi>holy Face,</hi> or compar'd with the ſupreme Standard and Origin of all Perfection and Purity. This perhaps might in Part be Bp JEWEL'S View, in that Paſſage of his before recited. For having occaſionally made the Remark, that "in God's Sight the <hi>Stars</hi> are <hi>unclean,</hi>" he brings in the Words of our <hi>Text,</hi> with this Gloſs upon it <q>Our <hi>Virtue,</hi> out <hi>Holineſs,</hi> &amp;c. are <hi>filthy,</hi> when they come to GOD'S Sight.</q> And I find the great Cardinal of <hi>Rome</hi> himſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly making this Conceſſion. <note n="†" place="bottom">BELLARM. <hi>de Juſtif.</hi> p. 381, 389.</note> 
               <q>So great (ſays he) is the Purity, and Sublimity of GOD'S <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> that <hi>all the Righteouſneſs</hi> of Men and Angels, compar'd with that, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears but UNRIGHTEOUSNESS. Juſt as a Candle, thô diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernibly ſhining in the dark, yet placed in the Rays of the Sun is extinguiſh'd, or as the brighteſt Stars diſappear in the Day-Light: So in Compariſon with GOD, all human <hi>Purity</hi> is as it were IMPURITY, and all our Beauty but Deformity.</q> Accordingly he quotes with Approbation that Saying of AUSTIN, <hi>Cujus Participatione juſti ſunt, ejus Comparatione nee juſti ſunt.</hi> That is, The <hi>Righteous</hi> loſe their Character, and appear UN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIGHTEOUS, upon a Compariſon with the divine Fountain, from whence they derive their Righteouſneſs. Agreably, I find the <hi>Cardinal</hi> applying in this Light ſeveral Paſſages in the Book of JOB. <q>
                  <hi>I know, it is ſo of a Truth: but ſhall Man be righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous</hi> in Compariſon <hi>of</hi> GOD!—<hi>Shall mortal Man be juſt</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd <hi>with</hi> GOD!</q>— So then, by the Adverſary's own free Conceſſions here (whatever he has elſewhere pretended to the contrary) there's no Need of ſuppoſing, that the <hi>Prophet's</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion reſpects only the <hi>Wicked;</hi> but may properly enough be refer'd to the <hi>Righteous,</hi> in a comparative Senſe. And ſurely there's none will deny, that <hi>all our Righteouſneſſes are as filthy Rags,</hi> when bro't into Compariſon with the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of GOD. Verily one ſuch Glimpſe as holy <hi>Job</hi> ſaw of God's tremendous Holineſs, might well make any Man cry out as he did, <hi>Behold, I am</hi> VILE! <hi>I abhor my ſelf.</hi> So the holy Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> when a Beam of the divine Glory flaſh'd in his Eyes, inſtantly loſing Sight of <hi>all his own Righteouſneſs,</hi> he broke out in that Language (equivalent to his Words in our Text) <hi>Wo is me, for I am undone, becauſe I am a Man of</hi> UNCLEAN <hi>Lips.</hi>— Now after this,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006500_0023_102913E73B85AFA8"/>
where is the <hi>Blaſphemy,</hi> or where the <hi>Abſurdity,</hi> of aſcribing to the Saints themſelves that humble Confeſſion, <hi>All our Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are as filthy Rags!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And view'd in other comparative Lights, <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have pleaded, that the Saints perſonal <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> loſes all its Purity and Glory. Thus, compar'd with that ſhining Array of habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Rectitude and Innocence, which adorn'd <hi>Adam</hi> originally in Paradiſe, what is the moſt compleat and gliſtering Garb of moral <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> now on Earth, but as broken Shreds of <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> and theſe defiled and blacken'd with Sin?— Or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with the <hi>Law of our Nature,</hi> the primitive Standard of actual <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> what is the moſt conſummate <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of imperfect Saints, but as <hi>filthy Rags?</hi> Verily 'tis at beſt as <hi>Rags;</hi> or as a Garment, not only ſhort of the true Meaſure, but full of ſhameful Sciſſures, its ſeveral Parts ſcarce hanging to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and this inconſiſtent <hi>ragged</hi> Garment, not only blemiſh'd by its own Defects and Rents, but <hi>foul'd</hi> too by attendant Luſts and Corruptions.—Or compar'd with the <hi>reveal'd</hi> Rule of our Obedience, the <hi>Law of the Lord</hi> which is <hi>perfect,</hi> his written <hi>Word</hi> which is <hi>very pure,</hi> is not the compleateſt <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of the moſt improv'd Saint upon Earth, but ſcanty and imperfect, yea, even <hi>as filthy Rags?</hi>— Or compar'd with the Purity and Perfection of the Saints themſelves in their <hi>heavenly</hi> State, what is the higheſt Perfection and Purity of Saints in this their <hi>Earthly</hi> Condition, but Imperfection and Impurity? The <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of <hi>ſome</hi> real Saints loſes its Brightneſs, when only compar'd to that of <hi>others,</hi> even now in this evil World, who ſhine with ſuperior moral Attainments: but what is the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of the moſt finiſh'd Staints on the Earth to that of glorify'd Saints in the World of ſpotleſs Purity and Perfection? In this comparative View, ſurely <hi>all</hi> our <hi>Righteouſneſſes</hi> appear as <hi>filthy Rags.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a Word, at leaſt, this is their due Character, if compar'd with the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of CHRIST, the admirable Pattern and Source of <hi>all our Righteouſneſſes.</hi> In Compariſon with that <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> which he exemplify'd in our Nature and Stead, and which is graciouſly imputed to Believers (call'd in Scripture <hi>the Righteouſneſs of</hi> GOD, from its Divine Author and immediate Subject, God incarnate, as well as from its Divine Inſtitution and Acceptance) in this Light ſurely the Saints own perſonal <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> at beſt appears full of uncomely Defects &amp; with an ugly Hue: not as the other, a <hi>fine Linen Robe white and clean,</hi> but rather like a dark, coarſe, rotten, <hi>leprous</hi> Garment. Verily there's an inconceivable Diſproportion between the Saints own

               <hi>inherent</hi> Righteouſneſs, and that of Chriſt <hi>imputed</hi> to them.— I will briefly ſtate the Reſemblance and Diſparity between them, in the agreable Words of the excellent Bp BARLOW, <note n="†" place="bottom">LETTERS <hi>concerning Juſtification by Faith only.</hi> p. 165, 166.</note> who underſtands the Prophet in our Text as ſpeaking, not <hi>abſolutely,</hi> but <hi>comparatively,</hi> and in Relation to the excelling <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of God our Saviour. His Words are; <q>
                  <hi>Iſaiah</hi> (confeſſing his own and his People's Sins) ſaith, <hi>All our Righteouſneſſes are as filthy Rags.</hi> So he calls even <hi>his own</hi> inherent <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> if compar'd with the abſolute and perfect <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> of CHRIST, by which all his Saints are juſtify'd. For this <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>imputed</hi> to his Saints, is in Scripture (<hi>Rev.</hi> 19.8.) call'd a compleat and intire <hi>Linen-Garment, white and clean,</hi> which (according to <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18. &amp; 6.11.) they have of CHRIST, to <hi>cover their Nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</hi> (It is not an inherent, but an imputed and external <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> which as a Robe or Garment <hi>covers their Sins</hi> and moral Nakedneſs. (<hi>Rom.</hi> 4.7.)—When Saint <hi>John</hi> ſays, imputed <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is a <hi>Linen-Robe, white and clean,</hi> and <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſays, our inherent <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> is <hi>filthy Rags,</hi> the Compariſon may ſtand thus; the Analogy and Difference thus appear. (1) Our bleſſed Saviour's <hi>imputed</hi> Righteouſneſs is an <hi>intire Robe,</hi> or <hi>Linen-Garment</hi> (as the Apoſtle calls it) per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <hi>white</hi> and <hi>clean,</hi> which covers all our Sins and moral Nakedneſs. But (2.) our own <hi>inherent</hi> Righteouſneſs is <hi>as filthy Rags.</hi> (1.) <hi>Rags</hi> only, or broken Fragments (as it were) and little Pieces of Righteouſneſs, and no intire Robe: for our many intervening Sins divide and rent it into <hi>Rags.</hi> And (2.) thoſe Rags too are not perfectly white and clean, but are <hi>filthy.</hi> Either (1.) in Reſpect of their <hi>Defects,</hi> which ſtain them: for, if God ſhould examine them according to the Severity of the moral Law, they would be found defective (at leaſt) in Degree, and be unable to abide the Trial, ſo as to juſtify us before God. Or (2.) they are <hi>filthy Rags,</hi> at leaſt <hi>comparatively,</hi> in Relation to the more excellent <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of CHRIST.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But I proceed now to the other particular Senſe, in which <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> have uſually explain'd and defended their general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Application of the Text. According to them,</p>

            </p>
            <p>PROTESTANTS have from the Beginning had warm Conteſts with the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Adverſary, on that important Queſtion, <q>
                  <hi>What is the</hi> MATTER <hi>of juſtifying Righteouſneſs?</hi>
               </q> (as Mr. <hi>Richard Hooker,</hi> a celebrated old Proteſtant expreſſes it) Or, <q>
                  <hi>What is</hi> that Righteouſneſs, <hi>by which a Man is juſtified in the Sight of God?</hi>
               </q>— Whether his own <hi>inherent</hi> Righteouſneſs, or that of Chriſt <hi>imputed</hi> to him?— The PAPISTS hold for the former, in Oppoſition to the latter. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Vid. BELLARM. <hi>de Juſtif.</hi> p. 125, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>According to the old PROTESTANTS, there's no ſafe Approach to God, but in the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of CHRIST <hi>imputed</hi> and receiv'd by <hi>Faith.</hi> The abſolute Neceſſity of this They tho't rationally grounded on the <hi>Impoſſibility</hi> of Juſtification by our own <hi>inherent</hi> Righteouſneſs: for a convincing Proof of which, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly pleaded the <hi>Imperfection</hi> of our beſt moral Attainments: and for the Evidence of this, they appeal'd to the whole Tenour of the ſacred Scriptures, to univerſal Experience and Obſervation, and to the conſtant Confeſſions of good Men from Age to Age.

Thoſe <hi>old Proteſtants</hi> tho't, "that unleſs we <hi>put on Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>cover</hi> us with his Body and Blood as with a Garment, our <hi>filthy Nakedneſs</hi> muſt appear, and nothing remain for us but <hi>Deſpair.</hi> They judg'd this clearly imply'd in the Prophet's Confeſſion, that <hi>all our Righteouſneſſes are as filthy Rags.</hi> And they judg'd that in the Prophet DANIEL'S Prayer equivalent to this: <hi>We do not preſent our Supplications before Thee for our own Righteouſneſſes, but for thy great Mercies.</hi> (Dan. 9.18.) Yea, they thought <hi>Iſaiah's</hi> Confeſſion to have been but the Language, conſtructively at leaſt, of all other eminent Saints on Scripture-Record. They were wont to inſtance in ſome correſponding Speeches of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of <hi>Jacob,</hi> of <hi>Job</hi> and his Friends, of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Aſaph,</hi> and <hi>Ezra,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> with others in the Old Teſtament; ſo of <hi>Peter,</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> of <hi>James,</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> and others in the New. [For Brevity, I omit the particular Paſſages refer'd to: Some of 'em have already been cited; and the moſt of 'em are obvious, to thoſe acquainted with their Bibles.] And when conſulting their own <hi>Experience,</hi> with that of other the People of God in their own Times, theſe old <hi>Proteſtants</hi> found this bearing Teſtimony to the Imperfection of their perſonal <hi>Righteouſneſſes,</hi> whether habitual or actual; ſo obliging them to make <hi>Iſaiah's</hi> Confeſſion <hi>their own.</hi> By melancholy Experience, they perceiv'd their Obedience daily interrupted and impeded, by the reſiſting Principle of <hi>indwelling Sin.</hi> They ſaw deplorable <hi>Flaws,</hi> and Spots of <hi>Filth,</hi> in their pureſt and moſt indefective <hi>Works of Righteouſneſs.</hi> Nor only in their moſt perfect Duties of <hi>Morality</hi> ſaw they Occaſion to lament very faulty Imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but complain'd too of a cenſurable Weakneſs even in their moſt vigorous Exerciſes of <hi>Faith</hi> itſelf.

               <hi>enter into Judgment with his Servants,</hi> and be ſtrict to <hi>mark Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.</hi> So that they dar'd not venture upon in Inquiſition by the inflexible Rule of Righteouſneſs, and ſtand a Trial at the Bar of Juſtice, under the Shelter of any <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of <hi>their own.</hi> They ſaw and confeſs'd <hi>this Covering</hi> too contracted, too deform'd and too defiled, to ſerve (by any Beauty or Virtue in it ſelf) either to attract the Favour of an offended Lawgiver, or to protect them from the Wrath of Him who is a conſuming Fire. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to any ſuch Purpoſe, they ſaw and confeſs'd <hi>all their Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſes</hi> to be but as <hi>filthy Rags,</hi> which the fiery Law &amp; incenſed Juſtice of God would burn up in its deſtroying Flames; had they Nothing more effectual, than their own <hi>pureſt Religion,</hi> to <hi>cover their Sins,</hi> and make their Perſons acceptable in the Sight of Him, whoſe <hi>Eyes</hi> are <hi>as a Flame of Fire,</hi> and who is <hi>of purer Eyes than to behold Inquity,</hi> in whatever Inſtance or Degree, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out infinite Diſpleaſure and Deteſtation. Upon ſuch Views of the Caſe, it was the Manner with theſe <hi>old Proteſtants,</hi> to ſtrip themſelves, as it were, of their own <hi>filthy Garments,</hi> laying them at the Feet of <hi>Jeſus,</hi> and to <hi>put on Chriſt</hi> by Faith, ſo <hi>cloathing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with Change of Raiment,</hi> when they bow'd their Knees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a holy God, And tranſacted with him in relation to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous Concerns of Pardon and Juſtification.</p>
            <p>Truly they confeſs'd themſelves afraid of <hi>going about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs,</hi> or even ſeeming to <hi>ſeek Righteouſneſs as it were by the Works of the Law.</hi> They ſaw that the <hi>Law is holy, and juſt, and ſpiritual,</hi> the <hi>Commandment exceeding broad,</hi> and the Demands of Divine Juſtice (whether in moral or penal Reſpects) tranſcending all Poſſibility of a perfect perſonal Fulfilment and Satisfaction by them. They ſaw it above their Power, either to atone for their paſt Sins, or to obey without Sin for the future. And hence, althô they knew that <hi>if there had been a Law which could have given Life, verily Righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law,</hi> yet as they by Experience found <hi>the Law weak thro' the Fleſh,</hi> and <hi>ſeeking to be juſtify'd by the Law</hi> but a vain Purſuit, they therefore <hi>ſought to be juſtify'd by Chriſt</hi> thro' Faith in his Blood, and looked unto Jeſus, as the Lord their <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> as well as Strength; abjuring <hi>Self,</hi> in every View, not only vicious Self, nor only civil Self, but righteous Self too, in this Affair of Juſtification before God. They abjur'd every Thing of <hi>their own</hi> in Competition with CHRIST, particularly as conſider'd in his <hi>reconciling</hi> Office: utterly foregoing <hi>all their Righteouſneſſes,</hi> as view'd under the Notion of <hi>pacifying</hi> and <hi>recommending Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſes</hi> in the Eyes of an affronted Lawgiver and juſt Judge.—

Indeed I can't find by any Hint in their Writings, that theſe <hi>old Proteſtants</hi> allow'd a Place, in this Buſineſs of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> for the Diſtinction ſome of late have ſo warmly eſpous'd, between a <hi>Law-Righteouſneſs</hi> and a <hi>Goſpel-Righteouſneſs</hi> of the moral Kind. Beſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince a perfect immaculate Obedience to the <hi>Law,</hi> in its Rigour, is impracticable in this fallen State of Mankind, they ſaw no Colour for any Hope of Juſtification by a (ſtrictly) <hi>Legal</hi> Righteouſneſs of <hi>our own:</hi> which, if it be not more than the very <hi>Papiſts</hi> pretend to, yet perhaps is all that ſome modern <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> in orthodox Language, appear to renounce. And for ought I can obſerve, neither did theſe <hi>old Proteſtants</hi> ſee any Room left, even in the mediatorial and infinitely condeſcending Scheme of redeeming Grace, for a Claim to <hi>Juſtification</hi> (properly ſpeaking) by an <hi>Evangelical</hi> Righteouſneſs of <hi>our own,</hi> or <hi>Works of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> done in Obedience to the Goſpel; conſidering the Saints moral <hi>Imperfection</hi> in their preſent State. For they ſaw the <hi>whole</hi> Duty of Man according to the moral Law, taken into the Syſtem of Divine Precepts in the Goſpel, without the Abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of any one moral Command, yea, without any Relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the Severity of the moral Rule, or the leaſt Abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Obedience in Point of Degree; but the univerſal and intire Law, (without Exception of an <hi>Iota</hi>) as a <hi>Rule</hi> of right Action, abiding in full Force and perpetual Obligation; not at all <hi>made void by Faith,</hi> but rather <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> and enforced by it. And in Conſequence of this, they concluded the <hi>Defects</hi> in the Saints Obedience to have the Nature of <hi>Sin;</hi> not only as being againſt the original <hi>Law</hi> of Morality, but againſt the Injunctions of the very <hi>Goſpel</hi> itſelf; and being thus ſinful, therefore needing Divine <hi>Forgiveneſs.</hi> In which State of the Caſe, they ſaw <hi>their own Righteouſneſs,</hi> in every View of it, abſolutely inſufficient, by any Worth or Excellency in it ſelf, to <hi>ingratiate</hi> them with an infinitely holy and omniſcient Lawgiver; and altogether unfit to be conſider'd as a <hi>juſtifying</hi> Righteouſneſs before God, even in the compaſſionate and gracious Plan of the Goſpel.— But <hi>the exceeding Riches of the Grace of God in his Kindneſs towards us by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the very Mercy of Mercies in the infinitely merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Scheme of Man's Salvation, theſe <hi>old Proteſtants</hi> ſaw, lay in the Proviſion of a better <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> than their own <hi>inherent,</hi> to anſwer the End of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and Intitlement to God's ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Favour, that is, the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of CHRIST, <hi>imputed</hi> to Believers, and <hi>covering their Sins</hi> from the Eye of vindictive Juſtice. Even as <hi>David</hi> alſo deſcribeth the <hi>Bleſſedneſs of the Man, to whom</hi> GOD <hi>imputeth Righteouſneſs without Works;</hi> ſaying,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:006500_0032_1029144501D50650"/>
               <hi>Bleſſed are they whoſe Iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe Sins are covered.</hi> This <hi>imputed</hi> Righteouſneſs they held to be <q>the moſt eſſential <hi>Recommendation</hi> to Heaven</q>; the only <hi>juſtifying Righteouſneſs</hi> before God, againſt the Challenges of his Law and Juſtice, affronted by their Sins and Imperfections; and this they held to be received only by <hi>Faith,</hi> a true and lively <hi>Faith.</hi> They held it for Goſpel-Doctrine, <q>that altho' <hi>Faith</hi> doth not ſhut out Repentance, Hope, Love, Dread and Fear of God, to be joined with Faith <hi>in every Man that is juſtified;</hi> yet it ſhuts them <hi>out from the Office of juſtifying,</hi>
               </q> and ſo from being joyn'd with CHRIST'S <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> to that End: they obſerved, <q>that Man cannot make himſelf <hi>righteous</hi> by his own Works, neither <hi>in Part</hi> nor <hi>in the Whole;</hi> for that were the greateſt Arrogancy and Preſumption of Man, that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> could ſet up againſt God, to affirm, that Man might by his own Works <hi>take away and purge his own Sins,</hi> and ſo <hi>juſtify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>

               </note>— While therefore they honour'd <hi>inherent Righteouſneſs</hi> in its Place and in Relation to its proper Ends, they dar'd not exalt <hi>that</hi> (under any Conſideration of it, whether as a <hi>Legal</hi> or <hi>Evangelical</hi> Righteouſneſs) to a Rivalſhip with CHRITS'S Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs <hi>imputed,</hi> or to a Co-partnerſhip with <hi>this,</hi> as the Matter or Ground and objective Reaſon of <hi>Juſtification</hi> before God.

            <p>Mr. PERKINS (in his Book, call'd <hi>The Reformed Catholick</hi>) had advanc'd, among others, this Argument for the Neceſſity of <hi>imputed</hi> Righteouſneſs; <q>
                  <hi>That which muſt be our</hi> Righteouſneſs <hi>before GOD, muſt ſatisfy the Juſtice of the</hi> LAW, <hi>which ſaith,</hi> Do theſe Things and live. <hi>But there is Nothing that can ſatisfy that Juſtice of the Law, but the Righteouſneſs and Obedience of</hi> JESUS CHRIST. <hi>Ergo.</hi> — Now under this Argument, to prove that the Righteouſneſs of the <hi>Regenerate</hi> &amp; <hi>Faithful</hi> is not ſuch as that it can anſwer the Juſtice and Righteouſneſs required in the <hi>Law,</hi> Mr. PERKINS alledgeth the common Confeſſion of all, indited by the Prophet ISAIAH, <hi>All our Righteouſneſs is a menſtruous</hi> or <hi>defiled Cloth.</hi> For if the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> commanded by the <hi>Law</hi> be moſt <hi>exact</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi> and <hi>no Righteouſneſs</hi> is performed by <hi>us,</hi> but what is by our Weakneſs and Corruption <hi>blemiſhed</hi> and <hi>ſtained,</hi> then can no Righteouſneſs of <hi>ours</hi> ſatisfy the Commandment of the <hi>Law.</hi>— To which Dr. BISHOP [the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſt] anſwereth, that <hi>the Prophet ſpeaketh theſe Words in the Perſon of the</hi> WICKED <hi>of that Nation and that Time; and therefore that they are</hi> madly <hi>applied unto the</hi> RIGHTEOUS.</q>— [Dr. ABBOT replies] <q>Where a Man would wonder, that <hi>he</hi> ſhould be ſo <hi>mad,</hi> as to imagine <hi>that</hi> Prayer to be made in the Perſon of <hi>wicked</hi> Men, or that wicked Men ſhould make Mention of any their <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> unto GOD! And as for the <hi>Time,</hi> it fitteth not the Age where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Prophet</hi> himſelf lived; but was <hi>prophetically</hi> written in Reſpect of a Time long after ſucceeding. He foreſaw in the Spirit the Deſolation of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and the Temple and that whole Land; and thereupon putteth himſelf in the Perſon of the FAITHFUL, and maketh himſelf as one of them that ſhould live at that Time. This is very apparent by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's Words (v. 10.) <hi>Thine holy Cities lie Waſte,</hi> &amp;c— This Prayer was to ſerve for a <hi>Direction</hi> to the FAITHFUL that <hi>then</hi> ſhould be, to make their Moan unto GOD, and to intreat

Mercy at his Hands. And very anſwerable to this propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Prayer is the Prayer of the Prophet DANIEL, made pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently at that Time [the Time of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s actual Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.] For whereas Mr. BISHOP, to prove that the Prophet ſpeaketh in the Perſon of the <hi>Wicked,</hi> alledgeth thoſe Words (v. 5) <hi>Lo, thou haſt been angry, for we have offended, and have ever been in Sin:</hi> the Prophet DANIEL likewiſe ſaith (Chap. 5, 7, 10) WE <hi>have ſinned and committed Iniquity, and done wickedly: O Lord, Righteouſneſs belongeth unto Thee, and unto US open Shame: WE have not obeyed the Voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his Ways, &amp;c.</hi> And whereas he alledgeth the other Words (Iſai. 64.7.) <hi>There is no Man that calleth upon thy Name, and ſtandeth up to take hold of Thee;</hi> the Prophet DANIEL in like Manner ſaith (Chap. 9 13.) <hi>WE have not made our Prayer before the Lord our God.</hi> Both of them [<hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi>] ſay, <hi>WE have offended, WE have ſinned, WE have not prayed,</hi> as ſhewing plainly that they ſo ſpake of <hi>other</hi> Men as that they implied <hi>Themſelves</hi> alſo. The Prophet DANIEL ſaith of <hi>himſelf</hi> (Chap. 9.20.) that in that Prayer <hi>he confeſſed his own Sins, and the Sins of the People.</hi> And why ſhould the Prophet DANIEL be ſaid to confeſs <hi>his own</hi> Sins, and not the Prophet ISAIAH, or thoſe <hi>Juſt</hi> and <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> in whoſe Perſon <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpake? Nay, both the one and the other ſpake out of the true Affection of the <hi>Faithful</hi> at all Times, who always find in themſelves <hi>Defects</hi> and <hi>Defaults,</hi> whereby they find juſt Cauſe in Confeſſion of Sins to join <hi>themſelves</hi> with other Men; even as the Prophet ISAIAH elſewhere doth (Chap. 6.5.) <hi>Wo is me; I am a Man of pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted Lips, and I dwell in the midſt of a People of polluted Lips.</hi>— We cannot doubt but that there were many <hi>faithful</hi> and <hi>godly</hi> among the Jews at that Time of their Deſolation: Yet in thoſe faithful and godly there was that <hi>Default,</hi> as that God ſaid of them (Iſa. 51.18.) <hi>There is</hi> NONE <hi>to guide her, among all the Sons that ſhe hath brought forth.</hi>— The Prophet could not ſay, WE <hi>have ſinned,</hi> WE <hi>have all been as an unclean Thing,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Intendment of <hi>himſelfe.</hi> — And that which the Prophet ſpake, did <hi>ſo</hi> concern the Faithful of <hi>that</hi> Time and Place whereof he ſpake, as that the ſame hath true Application to the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in <hi>all</hi> Times and in <hi>all</hi> Places; becauſe no Reaſon can be given, why the Faithful of <hi>one</hi> Time ſhould ſo ſpeak, but by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

            <p>Thus, Dr. ABBOT hath ſhewed, "That the Prophet by Way of Prophecy indited this Prayer in the Name of the <hi>Faithful,</hi> who

            <p>It remains, to ſay ſomething on the other Part of my Text, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s Words, in the ſame View &amp; Application wherein we have laſt been conſidering the Words of the Prophet, as referring to the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of <hi>real Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Apoſtle is in the Text and Context giving a Reaſon of the Hope that is in him, exhibiting the Ground of his preſent Confidence towards God, and declaring the Foundation on which he deſired to be finally ſtanding, when he ſhould appear before the <hi>Judge of all.</hi> For thoſe Expreſſions, <hi>That I may win Chriſt and be found in him,</hi> Expoſitors in general ſuppoſe, have a tacit Relation to the <hi>Judgment</hi> of GOD.— And they are agreed, I think, that the Apoſtle declares, not only that he formerly had renounced his Phariſaical <hi>Gains,</hi> as <hi>Loſs</hi> for CHRIST, but that he now undervalues <hi>all Things</hi> (whether worldly Advantages, Church-Privileges, or perſonal Accompliſhments, even all that's valu'd among Men) in <hi>Compariſon</hi> with CHRIST, and renounces <hi>every Thing</hi> whatſoever in <hi>Competition</hi> with Him: yea, that he now counts them but <hi>Loſs</hi> and <hi>Dung,</hi> comparatively to CHRIST, who was precious to him above all, whom he would ſuffer nothing to rival, and whom he ſuperlatively deſires to <hi>win,</hi> to gain the full Poſſeſſion of him, and to be <hi>found in him,</hi> at laſt, <hi>not having his own Righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But the Diſpute is, What <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> the Apoſtle here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends; and in what Reſpect he ſo undervalues this, counting it even as <hi>Dung.</hi>— Now the commonly receiv'd Opinion among PROTESTANTS has been, that the Apoſtle includes in his Idea <hi>all</hi> his own perſonal <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> of whatever Kind, Degree, or Date of Attainment: and as to the Notion under which he ſo depreciates <hi>his own Righteouſneſs,</hi> that it is not as conſider'd ſimply and abſolutely, but only <hi>comparatively</hi> to the more excellent <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of CHRIST, and relatively to the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Concern of being <hi>found of his Judge in Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The PAPISTS indeed are of Opinion, that the Apoſtle in our Text renounces <hi>nothing more</hi> than what he had in the preceeding Context already expreſs'd his Renunciation of, that is, his old <hi>Phariſaical Righteouſneſs,</hi> 
               <q>that <hi>external</hi> Righteouſneſs which he had while continuing in the <hi>Jews</hi> Religion:</q> and ſo they think, his Example can only teach us to renounce a meerly <q>
                  <hi>external</hi> Righteouſneſs, of Works without Faith, the Righteouſneſs of the <hi>Proud</hi> and <hi>Self-confident;</hi> a Righteouſneſs which cannot pleaſe God, and which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> holds <hi>Contempt.</hi>

               </gap> (without the prepoſitive Article, uſually met with in other Places) and may truly be read, My own Righteouſneſs which is <hi>of Law;</hi> not <hi>of</hi> [the] <hi>Law,</hi> as if it pointed particularly to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which is ſometimes call'd <hi>the Law,</hi> in Contradiſtinction to that <hi>Grace and Truth which came by Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> but only <hi>of Law,</hi> indefinitely and in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; or '<hi>from</hi> Law, from <hi>a</hi> Law, from <hi>any</hi> Law,' that God has given Men for a <hi>Rule,</hi> or eſtabliſh'd Meaſure of right Action. <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> indeed is a practical Conformity to the Law or Rule one is under: and ſo the Apoſtle by <hi>his own Righteouſneſs</hi> intends his Actions of Conformity to God's Law, the Rule of his Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, whatever it was. Now, it could not be the <hi>Levitical</hi> Law; for that was aboliſh'd by the Death of Chriſt, and the Apoſtle had long liv'd in the intire Neglect of that, nor ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be recall'd to the Obſervance of that. It muſt therefore mean the <hi>Goſpel-Law,</hi> in its moral Precepts and poſitive Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the only ſtanding reveal'd Rule, and the Law which he was now under a profeſſed Subjection to. Conſequently, when he here ſpeaks of <hi>his own Righteouſneſs of Law,</hi> he intends his perſonal <hi>Goſpel-Righteouſneſs,</hi> or his <hi>Works of Righteouſneſs</hi> in Obedience to the Goſpel-Rule, as well internal, as external. Surely he can't mean any bare <hi>external</hi> Righteouſneſs of his own, as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> pretend. For as he now had an <hi>inward</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Righteouſneſs, which he infinitely prefer'd to any meer outward Practice; ſo he well knew, that God's <hi>Law</hi> was a Rule to his <hi>inward,</hi> as well as outward Man; preſcribing to the Heart and Conſcience within, the Secrets of which God only is privy to, and not only to the viſible Converſation and Action among Men. He knew therefore, that only an outward Appearance of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> in the Sight of Men was not the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Law,</hi> which properly is a Righteouſneſs in the Sight of GOD. The Apoſtle muſt then, in the Renunciation which he now made of <hi>his own Righteouſneſs,</hi> have Reſpect to a <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> which was in ſome Meaſure conformable to <hi>Law,</hi> internal and real, not meerly external and apparent. Whatever <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> was now (ſubjectively) <hi>his own,</hi> whether inward or outward, he ſacrifices all, that he might <hi>win Chriſt;</hi> he repudiates the whole from being the Matter of his <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and truſts in nothing that is <hi>his own</hi> to recommend him to the Divine Mercy.</p>
            <p>And this Conſtruction of the Text has ſometimes been defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by alledging parallel Scriptures, where the Expreſſion, <hi>my</hi> or <hi>our Righteouſneſs,</hi> muſt neceſſarily deſign a <hi>real</hi> Righteouſneſs; not

conſiſting barely in Externals, but including a Degree of inward Conformity and ſincere Obedience to the Law of God. Here <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have generally inſtanc'd in <hi>Daniel</hi>'s Prayer (Chap. 9.18.) and in <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s Prayer (Chap. 64.6.) in particular, as parallel Places; where the Servants of God, in like Language of Renunciation with that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> uſe the Expreſſion, <hi>Our Righteouſneſſes,</hi> and moſt evidently intend <hi>real</hi> Righteouſneſſes, and not the outward Superficies or Semblance only of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, a meer Sceleton of Righteouſneſs, without any Thing of inward Subſtance and Vitality.

            <p>The PAPIST <note n="†" place="bottom">BELLARM. <hi>de Juſtif.</hi> p. 90 96, &amp; p. 176, 177.</note> indeed thinks perſonal <hi>Holineſs</hi> to be intended by the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Faith;</hi> which he ſuppoſes to mean, not any extrinſick, relative, imputed Righteouſneſs of <hi>another,</hi> but an intrinſick, qualitative, and moral Righteouſneſs of <hi>our own;</hi> call'd the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> becauſe <hi>Faith</hi> is the vital Root or Principle, from whence our ſincere Obedience ſprings: and this he imagines to be call'd <hi>the Righteouſneſs of</hi> GOD, becauſe God is the prime Efficient of it, becauſe 'tis an Image of his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and becauſe he accepts it for our Juſtification — But PROTESTANTS anſwer to this, that the Manner of Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on uſed by the Apoſtle here, neceſſarily carry's it to a different Senſe. He do's not ſay, <hi>the Righteouſneſs which</hi> IS <hi>Faith,</hi> or which is the <hi>Obedience of Faith;</hi> but <hi>that which is</hi> THROUGH <hi>Faith of Chriſt, the Righteouſneſs which is of God</hi> BY <hi>Faith.</hi> Phraſes never made Uſe of by this Apoſtle in his Writings, nor any where elſe in Scripture, to deſcribe <hi>our own</hi> inherent <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> as if <hi>Faith</hi> itſelf, or the Fruits of Faith produced in us, were the very <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> that is the Matter or objective Reaſon of our <hi>Juſtification</hi> before God: but always to point out the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of CHRIST (not his abſolute, but his reſpective, diſpenſative Righteouſneſs) as the Object which <hi>Faith</hi> eyes and receives, and centres its Expectations in, for obtaining Mercy. The Scriptures frequently mention the <hi>Righteouſneſs which is of God,</hi> the <hi>Righteouſneſs which is thro' Faith,</hi> but ever with a plain Reference to a Righteouſneſs foreign or extrinſecal to us; the Righteouſneſs of <hi>another,</hi> and not that which is in our ſelves;
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:006500_0041_10291406626F0C58"/>
an <hi>imputed,</hi> and not an <hi>inherent</hi> Righteouſneſs: which two <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſes</hi> the Apoſtle puts in Contradiſtinction to one another here and often elſewhere. Whereas, the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Gloſs on the Text deſtroys one of his Ideas, and confounds <hi>Juſtification</hi> with <hi>Sanctification,</hi> which are two Things very different in their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, have a very diſtant Situation in the Scheme of Redemption, and between which accordingly the Apoſtle always preſerves a wide Diſtinction, in his Diſcourſes upon them.</p>
            <p>It has been further remark'd by <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Writers, that there's a beautiful <hi>Gradation</hi> in the Apoſtle's Speech, of which our Text is a Part; that it is evidently <hi>progreſſive,</hi> not in the <hi>Tenſes</hi> only, but the <hi>Contents</hi> of it. None will deny, he advances from the <hi>paſt</hi> Time to the <hi>preſent:</hi> and PROTESTANTS hold, that <hi>his own Righteouſneſs of Law,</hi> which he renounces in our Text, means that which he had <hi>at the Time</hi> of his writing this Epiſtle; a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> therefore, and not a <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Righteouſneſs; and in the Renunciation he here makes, they ſuppoſe him, as by the whole Tenor of his Language he manifeſtly reſpects a <hi>future</hi> Time, to have a tacit Reference to the Day of <hi>Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this the PAPIST anſwers <note n="*" place="bottom">

than he had already, ſaying (ver. 8, &amp; 9.) <hi>Yea doubtleſs and I</hi> DO <hi>count</hi> ALL <hi>Things</hi> (whether paſt, or preſent) <hi>but Loſs,—and</hi> DO <hi>count them but Dung,</hi> THAT I MAY (hereafter) <hi>win Chriſt and he found in him, not having mine own Righteouſneſs, which is of the Law;</hi> or, as I think (the like Phraſe being ſo uſed elſewhere) it might be read, <hi>not having for my Righteouſneſs that which is of Law.</hi>— Now to ſuppoſe, as the PAPIST do's, that the Apoſtle is here only aſſerting his reſolute Adherence to a former Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he had made, at his Converſion from Judaiſm to Chriſtianity, and ſo but repeating in the <hi>preſent</hi> Tenſe that very ſame Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration which he had already expreſs'd ſufficiently in the <hi>paſt</hi> Tenſe; This, ſays the PROTESTANT, is very much to leſſen, if not deſtroy the Beauty and Energy of his Speech, to detract from the Propriety and Emphaſis of his Terms of Amplification, to confound his manifeſtly different Ideas, to ſink the Meaning and deaden the Spirit of the whole, and turn the Paſſage in our Text particularly into little better than an empty and trifling Tauto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy; when yet, in the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> View and Application of it, if appears very animated and ſtriking, truly rich in Senſe and new in its Contents.— Beſides, as the Apoſtle here, by the whole Aſpect of his Language, undoubtedly had in his Eye the future eternal Judgment and final Reſult of Things, it carry's the Face of extream Abſurdity, to ſuppoſe him, after ſo long a Courſe of <hi>Works of Righteouſneſs,</hi> in Character of a Chriſtian and in Quality of an Apoſtle of Chriſt, expreſſing now with ſo much Solemnity his Deſire that he might not go out of the World a meer <hi>Jew,</hi> and renouncing only the Hope of his being found at laſt in his <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Righteouſneſs! After ſo many Years of Goſpel-Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Miniſtry, how unreaſonable do's it look, to ſuppoſe, that when he is repreſenting to his Chriſtian Friends the preſent Ground of his Truſt for Juſtification before God, what <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs</hi> it now is or is not bottom'd upon, he ſhould in the renun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciative Part of his Declaration recur to an antiquated Pretenſion, a meer imaginary <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Righteouſneſs, which he had long ago relinquiſh'd; or at moſt, only ſpeak of a meer <hi>external</hi> Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs under the <hi>Goſpel?</hi> Truly, if it be not a Goſpel-Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, inherent and real, that he means here by <hi>his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Law,</hi> it ſeems, he can have no rational conſiſtent Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whatever.

inferiour moral Attainments, to look for Juſtification before God in Virtue of their own Righteouſneſs?</p>
            <p>Let vain-glorious PAPISTS delude and flatter themſelves with the pleaſing Idea of a preſent <hi>Perfection</hi> in their own Righteouſneſs, <q>an <hi>abſolute</hi> Juſtice in themſelves (as they ſpeak) free from all Infection of Sin, clear of all polluting Defects,</q> conſtituting them ſufficiently <hi>righteous</hi> before God, in the judiciary Senſe, making them amiable and acceptable in his Sight, and leaving no Occaſion for a ſuperadded <hi>imputed</hi> Righteouſneſs.!— This imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Perfection and Sufficiency of inherent Righteouſneſs the REFORMERS and their Followers have ever exploded, <q>as an idle Dream, a <hi>Pelagian</hi> Whimſy, a drunken Fancy (as Bp ABBOT ſpeaks <note n="†" place="bottom">Anſw. to Dr. BISHOP'S Epis. p. 138, 139. and Def. <hi>Ref. Cath.</hi> p. 418, 583, 585, 622.</note>) contrary to Experience, contrary to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, contrary to our own Confeſſions to God, and contrary to the Word of God.— There's none but <hi>unperfect Perfection</hi> here</q> (ſays he; meaning an Univerſality of Graces, but all delinquent in their Degree of Vigour and Activity, and Manner of Expreſſion) <q>None but what leaves us in Caſe to be call'd <hi>evil:</hi> of common and original Uncleanneſs there's That yet ſticking, for which Chriſt may ſay to us, as he did to his <hi>Apoſtles, YE being</hi> EVIL. To affirm Man now to be in <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> juſt and clean in the Sight of God, is to juſtle CHRIST out of his Place, who is <hi>the Lord our Righteouſneſs.</hi> It is to defeat the Work of GOD, by whom <hi>he is made unto us Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi>— Not but that <hi>we</hi> alſo by him do work Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, according to the Grace given us; but <hi>this</hi> Righteouſneſs is, thro' our Corruption and Frailty, too weak and baſe, to ſtand before God, for us to be ſaved thereby.— But <hi>Faith</hi> is our <hi>Comfort;</hi>— that as <hi>Jacob</hi> receiv'd the Bleſſing and Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance in the Apparel of <hi>Eſau,</hi> his elder Brother, to whom the ſame did properly belong, ſo we receive the Bleſſing of God, and are accepted unto eternal Life, in the Garment of the Righteouſneſs of CHRIST, by <hi>Faith</hi> in him.— It's our Safety, that <hi>this</hi> overſhadoweth the Errour of our Works, that this covereth our Imperfections, which diſgrace and blemiſh <hi>all our Righteouſneſs.</hi> What have we to cover and hide the ſame, but the Fleece of the Merit of Jeſus Chriſt?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Well therefore might the Apoſtle (and Proteſtants after his Example) ſo ardently breathe after CHRIST, and expreſs his
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:006500_0045_1028DC71B9A35F00"/>
earneſt Expectation and Deſire to be <hi>found in Him,</hi> united to him, intereſted in him, poſſeſs'd of him, covered with him, hid in his Wounds, inveſted with the "Purple Garment of Redemption by his Blood," and enwrapped in that long, large and rich Cloke of the Redeemer's <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> thrô Faith in him.— In Conſequence, well might the Apoſtle (and we after him) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively deſpiſe all his own beſt Attire of <hi>inherent</hi> Righteouſneſs, in Reſpect of that ſuperlatively excellent Robe of <hi>imputed</hi> Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and with Relation to that great Concern of his <hi>obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercy</hi> in the great Day. Well might he deſire to be found, at that Day, <hi>not having for his Righteouſneſs that which is of Law;</hi> this being in ſtrict Law-Conſideration but imperfect, and on a Trial by Law utterly inſufficient to juſtify him. Though truly valuable in the Apoſtle's (and ſo in the Proteſtant's) Judgment, for it's Divine Original, for its excellent Nature, and for its Uſefulneſs to its proper Ends, and altho' highly eſteem'd as a Part of the Salvation which is by Chriſt, as one of the precious Benefits of his Purchaſe, and an eſſential Requiſite to future Happineſs in the actual Poſſeſſion and full Enjoyment of him; yet this perſonal Righteouſneſs being at preſent but <hi>imperfectly</hi> attain'd by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd Apoſtle himſelf, he dares not confide in it for a ſafe Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the dread Tribunal of infinite Juſtice, but deſires and hopes to be found under a more ſure and effectual Covert. Not that he wiſh'd to be <hi>uncloathed,</hi> in point of Sanctification; but only to be found <hi>clothed upon,</hi> with a ſuperiour and more effectual Righteouſneſs than his own, in Point of Juſtification.</p>
            <p>He well knew both <hi>ſanctifying</hi> Righteouſneſs and <hi>juſtifying</hi> Righteouſneſs to be in their ſeveral Places, and for their ſeveral Purpoſes, of infinite Importance; the former to give him a <hi>Meetneſs,</hi> and the latter, to give him a <hi>Title</hi> to be a Partaker of the heavenly Inheritance. While therefore he follows after <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> as of fundamental moral Obligation, and in the Nature of Things a requiſite Preparative for poſſeſſing and enjoying the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance; yet nevertheleſs, as knowing his preſent Attainments to be very defective, and conſequently in the Reaſon of Things im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be his <hi>juſtifying</hi> Righteouſneſs before God, he founds no Claim of Right upon it, in Virtue of it's own Worth, but in this View renounces it altogether. He deſires, he mayn't be found having for his <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> that which is of <hi>Law,</hi> his own moral Righteouſneſs only, to guard and recommend him at the awful Day he has in Proſpect; but that he might be found hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him a more ſufficient and compleat Armour of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even that which is by <hi>Faith,</hi> the only effectual <hi>Cover</hi> to <hi>his
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:006500_0046_1029145BCBCF02A0"/>
Sins,</hi> and the only ſure Defenſative from the <hi>Wrath to come.</hi> To this final Iſſue of Things, the Apoſtle is generally tho't to have pointed his Eye, in the Words before us. And under ſuch a Proſpect, he has been tho't by Proteſtants to ſpeak ſo diſtruſtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and diſparagingly of his own imperfect <hi>Righteouſneſs;</hi> apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it even the depreciating Name of <hi>Dung,</hi> as being unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the Character of a <hi>juſtifying</hi> Righteouſneſs, and of no Suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in it ſelf to intitle him to the ſpecial Mercy of God.</p>
            <p>Thô indeed his thus under-valuing it has alſo been ſometimes accounted for in another Way; by ſuppoſing, he might reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably diſparage it as view'd in a <hi>comparative</hi> Light. He might deſervedly reproach his own Righteouſneſs, as being but <hi>Dung</hi> and <hi>Filth,</hi> in Compariſon of the ſupreme and infinite Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of GOD: ſince we read, <hi>There is none holy as the Lord;</hi> yea it is written, <hi>There is none good, but one, that is</hi> GOD. Behold, the <hi>Heavens</hi> are not clean in his Sight: the brighteſt <hi>Star</hi> above is eclips'd by his ſuperiour Glory, and appears but as a Lump of <hi>Dung</hi> and Impurity.—So be might juſtly call it by this diſgracing Name, in Compare with the immaculate and indefective Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of the Man JESUS, that holy and juſt One.—In a Word, (to omit other Compariſons) he might, by Reaſon of the Pollutions cleaving to his pureſt Goſpel-Righteouſneſs, while in this World of Imperfection, repreſent it under ſo derogatory an Emblem, in Reſpect of the <hi>Glory</hi> to be reveal'd in him, and in Compare with the ſupereminent Holineſs and ſinleſs Perfection of Saints in the <hi>Reſurrection-State.</hi> Hence that Obſervation of AUSTIN, a celebrated Father <note n="‖" place="bottom">Cited by Bp ABBOT, ubi ſupra, p. 584, 585.</note> (<hi>In Comparatione Reſurrectionis illius,</hi> Stercus <hi>eſt tota iſta Vita quam gerimus,</hi> &amp;c.) <q>That all the Life which we live here, <hi>i. e.</hi> all the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of this Life, is but <hi>Dung</hi> in Compariſon of the <hi>Reſurrection;</hi> that if a Man mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure himſelf, what he is now and what he ſhall be then, he will find This which now is, to be but <hi>Loſs</hi> and <hi>Dung</hi> in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon of That.</q> I ſuppoſe, as <hi>Auſtin</hi> here plainly alludes to our Text, he might naturally enough be led into this Illuſtration upon it by ſome remarkable Paſſages in the following Context; where the Apoſtle throws a comparative Slight on all his paſt and preſent moral Attainments, and declares, that <hi>forgetting</hi> every Thing <hi>behind,</hi> he only looks <hi>forward,</hi> preſſing towards the Mark and breathing after the Perfection and Glory he hop'd for at the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of the Juſt.— Now, taking the Text in any ſuch

            <p>But ſtill the POPISH Writers, I find, renew the Charge upon us, proſecute it in ſundry Particulars, and urge it with ſome new Enforcements: which it may be worth while to take a diſtinct Conſideration of, thô as briefly as I well can.—Let it be obſerv'd,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) The foremention'd Popiſh Prieſt Dr. BISHOP'S moſt plauſible Plea is, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Cited by Bp ABBOT, Def. <hi>Ref. Cath.</hi> p. 400.</note> 
               <q>That inherent <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> being GOD'S <hi>Gift,</hi> is of it ſelf <hi>pure,</hi> and has ſufficient Virtue in it ſelf to the <hi>End</hi> for which it is given, the making a Man <hi>righteous.</hi>
               </q>— However, to this the PROTESTANT makes Reply; that this <hi>End,</hi> taken in its <hi>moral</hi> View, is but <hi>imperfectly</hi> attain'd at preſent, by the largeſt Partaker of the Gift of ſanctifying Grace: and for that Reaſon, it is impoſſible, <hi>inherent</hi> Righteouſneſs ſhould reach this <hi>End,</hi> taken in it's <hi>forenſick</hi> or <hi>relative</hi> Notion; but in this View 'tis ſecured to us only by an <hi>imputed</hi> Righteouſneſs, even that which is of GOD thrô Faith. It is <hi>this,</hi> that the Apoſtle intends in the Place alluded to, where he mentions <hi>the Gift of Righteouſneſs;</hi> and he deſcribes it, <hi>the Gift by Grace, which is by one Man, Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> (Rom. 5.) He calls it <hi>the Righteouſneſs of</hi> ONE, <hi>the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of</hi> ONE: and informs us, that it's by <hi>this</hi> we obtain <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Life,</hi> by <hi>this</hi> we are <hi>made righteous,</hi> i. e. in the forenſick or relative Senſe. In this Law-Senſe our own Obedience can never conſtitute us <hi>righteous</hi> before God; becauſe it is in it ſelf at beſt but an imperfect Conformity to the Rule of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and is attended with a depraving Mixture of <hi>Unrighteouſneſs,</hi> and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Tranſgreſſions of the Law. <hi>Bp</hi> ABBOT obſerves, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inherent Righteouſneſs, <note n="†" place="bottom">

            <p n="2">(2.) 'Tis objected, that this very Apoſtle, who is ſuppos'd in our Text to renounce his evangelical Works of Righteouſneſs, do's elſewhere dignify and applaud ſuch Works, by intitling them the <hi>Fruit of the</hi> SPIRIT: and therefore he can't rationally be ſuppos'd to ſtigmatiſe the very ſame Works with the diſhonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Name of <hi>Dung;</hi> but it muſt be <hi>blaſphemous,</hi> to make ſuch a Suppoſition.

this, ſuch ought to and will preſerve a <hi>humble</hi> Opinion both of themſelves and their Works.— However, we demand; <hi>Who</hi> are they that ever ſaid, the <hi>good Works</hi> of the Regenerate are "<hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but</hi> DUNG?" Did ever any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> drop ſuch an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, at leaſt without ſome proper Guard or Limitation, to point out an honeſt and conſiſtent Meaning? Or is this any juſt Conſequence of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Opinion, we are debating upon! No, the Inſinuation is abuſive, and a wicked Calumny. For we do not ſay, we do not think, nor does our Opinion at all infer, that good Works are to be ſo call'd <hi>abſolutely,</hi> in univerſal and indefinite Terms; but only in a <hi>comparative</hi> Senſe, and in Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of a particular <hi>End</hi> and <hi>Uſe</hi> of them. We confeſs them good and profitable to Men, and gratefully acknowledge the Grace of God in Chriſt towards us in forming and furniſhing us to good Works: But ſtill we ſuppoſe 'em not deſign'd of God, nor ſuited in their own Nature, to anſwer <hi>every</hi> valuable Purpoſe; and view'd in ſome certain Poſitions, we ſuppoſe them to have <hi>no Glory,</hi> by Reaſon of the Glory that excelleth. Being in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves imperfect, and intermingled with Sin, we maintain that they are as <hi>Dung,</hi> in Compariſon with CHRIST'S Righteouſneſs, and in Relation to the noble End <hi>This</hi> is deſign'd and adapted for, the recovery of the divine Favour to a periſhing Sinner, ſetting him right in the Court of Heaven, and ſecuring him againſt all the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenges of God's Law and Juſtice, to which any the leaſt Sin muſt otherwiſe inevitably expoſe him.—We maintain the Neceſſity and Advantage both of <hi>imputed</hi> and <hi>inherent</hi> Righteouſneſs; and think them both of ſuch Conſequence and Uſe to us, in their reſpective Places, as highly to deſerve our Eſteem, and our Thankſgivings to God: the latter as conſtituting our <hi>Meetneſs,</hi> the former as founding our <hi>Right,</hi> to inherit the Kingdom of God. But now ſhall it be ſaid, we deſpiſe the one or other of theſe, the <hi>Meetneſs</hi> or the <hi>Right</hi> to inherit, becauſe we don't jumble and blend them together in our Doctrine, without Diſtinction? Shall it be ſaid, we deſpiſe <hi>Sanctification,</hi> becauſe we don't confound it with <hi>Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication?</hi> Or with what Truth can it be ſaid, that we account <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent</hi> Righteouſneſs good for Nothing at all, and of no Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to us in the leaſt, meerly becauſe we don't own it good for every Purpoſe, and in particular deny it's Fitneſs to the End of our <hi>Juſtification?</hi> With what Face of Truth or Honeſty, can it be pretended, that we abſolutely deſpiſe moral Virtue as meer <hi>Dung,</hi> becauſe we ſay that we are <hi>juſtified</hi> by Faith, and not by Works? Do's this annul the Neceſſity, or deſtroy all Uſe and Benefit of real Vertue? The Eye is not the Hand, nor is fitted
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:006500_0057_102914E0AB99AEA0"/>
to do the Office of the Hand, and therefore cannot ſay to it, I have no Need of thee: The Head is not the Foot, nor is fitted to it's Deſign, and ſo cannot ſay to the Foot, I have no Need of thee: but yet are they not all of the Body and all of Uſe? Shall it be ſaid that, we affirm, The Ear is not of the Body, or is of no Service, becauſe we ſay, It is not the Eye, and cannot ſee? Or that we hold, the ſmelling Faculty is of no Benefit, becauſe we ſay, It is not the Hearing? Or, if we diſtinguiſh between theſe Things, ſo different in their Nature and End, and refer each to its proper Place and Uſe, ſhall it be ſaid that we deſpiſe or are unthankful for the one or the other? No, we notwithſtanding <hi>value</hi> both, and are <hi>thankful</hi> for both, in each of the Compariſons. So in the preſent Caſe, tho' we diſtinguiſh between Faith and Works, between Juſtification and Sanctification, and between Righteouſneſs imputed and inherent; yet we preſerve a Value for both, and are thankful for both, in Reſpect of their ſeveral Ends and Uſes. And hence, altho' we rate our own defective Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience as <hi>Dung,</hi> in Compariſon with the vicarious and meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Obedience of CHRIST, and as conſider'd under the Notion of a <hi>juſtifying</hi> Righteouſneſs, which is the whole of our Meaning, and we ſuppoſe was the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s real Meaning; yet this is not in the leaſt inconſiſtent with our being truly <hi>thankful</hi> to God for his Mercy in renewing and purifying our Hearts by Faith, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we are diſpos'd and capacitated to <hi>work Righteouſneſs.</hi> No, there's a palpable Agreement between <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Gratitude</hi> in this Caſe; the former by no Means excludes the latter; both theſe gracious Tempers of Mind ſubſiſt and act with the greateſt Harmony and mutual Subſerviency, in the ſame Subject: and both are the Property and Characteriſtics of the regenerate Soul. Where the one or other is wanting, 'tis a dark Symptom. In particular without <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> for the Proviſion of a better <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi> than our own, for our <hi>Juſtification,</hi> or without that <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility</hi> towards God, which excludes Self-Confidence and Boaſting in <hi>our own Righteouſneſs,</hi> there's but little Sign of our being <hi>the Workmanſhip of God created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works.</hi>— I call to Mind thoſe appoſite Sayings of a late excellent Divine of our own <note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. C. MATHER, <hi>Everl.

                  <hi>Loſs</hi> and <hi>Dung</hi> to be a Name good enough for the beſt Thing that ever thou didſt, thou art <hi>in thy own Righteouſneſs</hi> to this Day.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But the PAPIST adds one Reflection more;</p>
            <p n="6">(6) <q>In fine, if the good Works of the Faithful are <hi>Loſs</hi> and <hi>Dung,</hi> then certainly they ought <hi>not</hi> to be <hi>practiſed</hi> and <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered</hi> to, but <hi>ſhook off</hi> and <hi>thrown away.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>No, ſays the PROTESTANT, not by any Means. This is no juſt Conſequence from our Doctrine: there's no Appearance of Reaſon for ſuch an Inference. What we plead for, is their being excluded from all Concernment in <hi>Juſtification of Life:</hi> with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to <hi>this</hi> indeed let 'em be put away out of Sight, and treated with Neglect, in point of Dependance or pleaſing Reflection upon them; nay, let 'em be even contemned, as worthleſs <hi>Dung,</hi> in Compariſon with the Righteouſneſs of CHRIST, the only recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling and juſtifying Righteouſneſs. In reſpect of this, the Apoſtle deſpis'd and repudiated every Thing of his own; All went, that he might <hi>win Chriſt, and be found in Him, not having for his Righteouſneſs that which is of Law:</hi> for he knew, there was no <hi>Law</hi> in Being, whoſe <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> could juſtify a morally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Creature. Indeed the <hi>Law</hi> Man was originally placed under, had a Reference and Aptitude to the Deſign of <hi>Juſtification:</hi> but then it was the Juſtification of a <hi>righteous</hi> and <hi>innocent,</hi> not an apoſtate ſinful Man; ſo that upon the Loſs of his Innocence, there was a Change of his Caſe, in point of Capacity to reach Juſtification by the <hi>Deeds of the Law.</hi> And whatever Degree of moral <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> habitual or actual, any may recover by the Grace of God, yet it being ever defective, while in this World, and unequal to the Demands of the Law moral, it is conſequently unequal to the Deſign of <hi>juſtifying</hi> him in the Eye of the Law. Only the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is adequate to the Law-Demand, and ſatisfactory to Divine Juſtice: therefore only this, imputed and received by Faith, is ſufficient to <hi>juſtify the Ungodly.</hi> In point of <hi>Juſtification</hi> then good Works are by no Means to be the Object of our Confidence; but the Righteouſneſs of CHRIST alone is to engroſs our whole Truſt and Regard: Yet this do's not in the leaſt argue, that good Works muſt be of no Account at all with us, in point of <hi>Sanctification.</hi> Tho' contemptible in one View, mayn't they be reſpectable in another? Tho' not at all influential to effect one Deſign, mayn't they be ſubſervient to another End? It's truly abſurd to a high Degree, only becauſe we maintain, that <hi>our Righteouſneſs</hi> inherent, under the Reſpect of a <hi>juſtifying</hi> Righteouſneſs (a Reſpect which it neither is calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:006500_0059_102A780E139E04B8"/>
nor intended for) and in Competition with Righteouſneſs <hi>imputed,</hi> muſt have no Conſideration with us, to infer, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore moral Virtue is under every other Reſpect to be of no Value with us, that good Works are not worthy of our Practice or Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit in any Regard: but only fit Objects of our Contempt, &amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving intirely to be caſt out of our Care and Eſteem. No, this is as far from being a genuine Conſequence of our Doctrine, as it is diſtant from the Spirit and Diſpoſition of a genuine <hi>Proteſtant.</hi> We are not for abandoning, but for cheriſhing the Love and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of <hi>good Works;</hi> tho' we decline truſting in them to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend us to God, and intitle us to his ſaving Mercy. Nor did the Apoſtle, while diſparaging his own Righteouſneſs under the Name of <hi>Loſs</hi> and <hi>Dung,</hi> mean to undervalue it in all Reſpects; and when he deſires to be found in Chriſt, <hi>not having his own Righteouſneſs,</hi> he do's not intend to ſuggeſt as if he were deſirous to part with it, or willing to be diſpoſſeſs'd of it, to loſe what he had gain'd in point of Sanctification, and in that Reſpect to be found without it; no, by no Means: he only deſigns to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his Deſire that he might be found at laſt <hi>not having this</hi> for his <hi>juſtifying</hi> Righteouſneſs, but having a better Righteouſneſs than his own, that wou'd effectually anſwer this bleſſed Purpoſe. Otherwiſe, for various excellent Purpoſes, he was bent upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently following every <hi>good Work,</hi> endeavouring that he might <hi>perfect Holineſs</hi> in the Fear of God, and ſeeking after a <hi>Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs according to Law,</hi> as fully conformable to the moral Rule as poſſible in this imperfect State; and he long'd for Heaven with a View as much to the perfect Purity, as the perfect Reſt and Happineſs of that better Country. And this is the Principle, this the Spirit of the real <hi>Proteſtant.</hi> He loves the <hi>Law</hi> of God, and is alive to it as the Rule of moral Duty; while yet as a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> of Works, he is dead to it. And while making the Obedience <hi>of Chriſt</hi> his Truſt, he alſo conſiders it as an Example for his Imitation, and deſires to have the Image, as well as the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt upon him: nor can content himſelf with an idle Profeſſion of juſtifying Faith, but ſtudies to <hi>ſhew his Faith by his Works;</hi> and the more <hi>ſtrong in Faith,</hi> the more <hi>zealous of good Works;</hi> the more CHRIST is <hi>precious to them that believe,</hi> the more hateful will Sin appear, and Holineſs the more amiable in their Eyes; which Views will by a natural Efficacy put them upon ſhunning the one and following the other.

if the <hi>Righteouſneſs of</hi> CHRIST were more prized by us, there wou'd be more of real <hi>Holineſs</hi> among us.</q>

            <p>Upon the Whole, what little Ground then had the CARDINAL, whoſe Reaſonings we've been examining, to conclude them with that inſulting Reflection; "Let [the <hi>Proteſtant</hi>] now go his Way and complain that we call him an <hi>Enemy to good Works!</hi>"</p>
            <p>No, ſays the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> in Return, we deteſt the vile Character; and conſcious of Innocence, we confront our injurious Accuſers. We claim to be the trueſt <hi>Friends,</hi> and not at all Enemies to good Works, whether in point of Doctrine, or Diſpoſition, Principle or Fact. Religiouſly we teach the Neceſſity, the Excellency, and the Uſefulneſs of good Works; nor hold any Opinion, but what in its true Conſtruction is friendly, not inimical to them. Indeed we renounce the undue Honours which our Adverſaries claim for them, and are careful to have the Reſpects paid 'em duly regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, conformably to the Scripture-Rule: Accordingly we conſider good Works as the Fruit or Conſequent of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and don't ſet them up as the Cauſe, the Reaſon or antecedent Condition of it; we don't exalt 'em to a Rivalſhip with CHRIST'S <hi>Righteouſneſs;</hi> we don't ſet them in Competition with <hi>Faith:</hi> but ſtill we value them in their proper Place and Order, &amp; with Reference to their genuine Ends. We think it our bounden Duty, and an Ingredient of our Happineſs, as well as becoming our Goſpel-Profeſſion, to be the genuine Lovers and Practiſers of good Works. We recommend the Love and Practice of them to others. In Conformity to Scripture-Doctrine, we inculcate upon them that <hi>have believed,</hi> a Care to exhibit and evidence their <hi>Faith,</hi> by a <hi>good Converſation in Chriſt.</hi> Nor dare we flatter any in their Pretenſion to <hi>juſtifying Faith,</hi> while we ſee it contradicted by their habitual Neglect of holy Behaviour: for according to our Doctrine, the <hi>Faith</hi> which receives CHRIST for <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> do's alſo receive him for <hi>Sanctification;</hi> &amp; not only apply's his <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> to cover our Sins, but his <hi>Strength</hi> to excite and enable us to <hi>work Righteouſneſs</hi> our ſelves, to mortify our Luſts, to cleanſe our Hands, and purify our Hearts, that we may glorify <hi>God</hi> in this World, and be prepared to enjoy Him in a better. How then can we juſtly be characteriz'd <hi>Enemies to good Works!</hi> Nay, but in Truth the foul Character belongs to thoſe who are <hi>Enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt</hi> and to <hi>Faith in his Blood;</hi> the one being the procuring Cauſe, and the other the producing Principle of good Works.— We cloſe with the Words of Bp HALL <note n="*" place="bottom">His WORKS, p. 316, 677. and his <hi>Old Religion,</hi> p. 40.</note>

What is <hi>Faith</hi> (ſays he) but the <hi>Hand</hi> of the Soul? What is the <hi>Duty</hi> of the Hand, but either to <hi>hold</hi> or <hi>work?</hi> This Hand then holds <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and works <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Holineſs.</hi>— Let me ſling this Stone into the brazen Forheads of our Adverſaries, which in their ſhameleſs Challenges of our Religion dare tell the World, that we are all for <hi>Faith,</hi> nothing for <hi>Works,</hi> and that we hold Works to Salvation as a Parentheſis to a Clauſe, that it may be perfit without them: Heaven and Earth ſhall witneſs to the Injuſtice of this Calumniation, and your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſhall be our Compurgators this Day, which ſhall teſtify to you, both now and on your Death-Beds, that we have taught you, there is no leſs Neceſſity of <hi>good Works,</hi> than if you ſhould be ſaved by them; and that altho' you cannot be ſaved by them, as the meritorious Cauſes of your Glory, yet you cannot be ſaved without them, as the neceſſary Effects of that Grace which brings Glory.— Let the vain Sophiſtry of carnal Minds deceive it ſelf with idle Subtilties, and ſeek to elude the plain Truth of God, with Shifts of Wit: We bleſs God for ſo clear a Light, and dare caſt our Souls upon this ſure Evidence of God.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The APPLICATION of what has been ſaid now remains. The Weight and Uſefulneſs of the Subject would invite us to dwell ſtill longer on it, by way of Reflection and Inference, in a Variety of Particulars, that might profitably be enlarg'd upon. But I muſt only ſuggeſt the following Hints; which may the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffice, as I've endeavour'd to throw a practical Light on the Argument all along thro' the Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> No Wonder then, that Miniſters of more mature Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Experience in Religion, have commonly laid out ſo much of their Labours in the Word upon that great Evangelical Subject, the <hi>Righteouſneſs of</hi> CHRIST, made ours by the Donation of God and the Application of <hi>Faith;</hi> and when on any <hi>moral</hi> Subject, that they have ſtudy'd diſcreetly to aſſign it's due Place in Chriſtian Divinity, and to point out the true Principles of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Obedience, refer it to it's genuine Ends, and inculcate a humble Dependance on CHRIST both for <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> while they urged the Purſuit of perſonal Holineſs. — It has riſen from a Conſciouſneſs of their own Imperfection and Inſufficiency, from a dutiful Regard for the Honour of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and a tender Care for the Salvation of Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> How ſolicitous ſhould all Miniſters (pretending to the Character of <hi>Proteſtant</hi>) be, that in preaching on <hi>moral</hi> Themes they well regulate, methodize and guard their Diſcourſes, leſt any
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:006500_0062_1029147BA7EF1178"/>
Hearer ſhould thro' their Heterodoxy or Careleſneſs <hi>get a Snare to his Soul?</hi> Here, omitting all that my own Tho'ts might ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt, I ſhall only aſk your Attention to what that venerable Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our Iſrael, the late Mr. WILLARD, ſays in his judicious and faithful Sermon, intitled, <hi>Morality not to be rely'd on for Life;</hi> where having among other Things obſerv'd, touching <q>the Influence <hi>Faith</hi> has into our moral Obedience, That it makes us apprehenſive we can be <hi>accepted</hi> only <hi>in the</hi> BELOVED, That it makes us confeſs with the <hi>Church</hi> (Iſa. 64.6.) <hi>All our Righteouſneſſes are as filthy Rags,</hi> and to profeſs with <hi>Paul</hi> (Phil 3.8.) <hi>I count all Things but Loſs and Dung that I may win Chriſt;</hi>
               </q> He begins the Application of his excellent Diſcourſe with this Inference, which I ſhall repeat intire as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of our ſolemn Conſideration, and what may be, if I miſtake not, a Word in Seaſon. <q>
                  <hi>Hence</hi> (ſays he) <hi>what Caution had Goſpel-Miniſters need to uſe in their preaching up of</hi> moral <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?</hi> That it is their Duty to preach them and preſs them upon their Hearers, is certain; otherwiſe they cannot be faithful in <hi>declaring the whole Counſel of God:</hi> And yet, if they ſo preach them as to <hi>revive the Covenant of Works,</hi> to <hi>advance the Righteouſneſs of Man,</hi> and <hi>depreciate the Righteouſneſs of</hi> CHRIST, they are far from being the Miniſters of CHRIST, and are indeed the Betrayers of Souls, as far as in them lieth. Nor indeed (ſays he) do I know of any Thing which doth more threaten the Undermining of true Chriſtianity and the bringing in of <hi>another Goſpel,</hi> than the putting of <hi>moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi> into a Legal Dreſs, and without any more Ado to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to us as the <hi>Graces</hi> of our Chriſtian Religion. He who when he hath told Men all the moral Duties required in the Law of God, and laid them out according to their Nature, as they were enjoined on them in the <hi>Firſt Covenant,</hi> ſaith to them, <hi>This do and live;</hi> and doth not endeavour to ſhew them that there is ſomething more <hi>wanting,</hi> without which they are undone, will be found an Enemy of Grace and a Murderer of Souls: Nor would I have ſuch a Miniſter's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to give in the laſt Day, for a Thouſand Worlds.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Further,</hi> From what has been diſcours'd, we learn our Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of <hi>Gratitude</hi> to the God of all Grace for his infinite Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion towards us, in providing ſo happily for our <hi>Juſtification</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, by ſending his dear Son to <hi>bring in everlaſting Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> the grand Relief of a guilty World.— And what has been ſaid, teaches us to admire the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God, in not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating the <hi>Sanctification</hi> of his People at preſent; that ſo <hi>the
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:006500_0063_102914EBDC007CD0"/>
Righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith,</hi> might have its due Honours reſerv'd to it, and the Riches of Divine Grace appear the more conſpicuous in the Saint's eternal Salvation.— Hereby alſo we learn the <hi>Importance</hi> of yielding a firm Credit and ſerious Attention to thoſe peculiar Doctrines of Revelation, concerning <hi>Original Sin, imputed Righteouſneſs, Juſtification by Faith only, the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of God in Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. Doctrines ſo clearly exhibited in the Scriptures, and ſtriking directly at that <hi>Self-Righteouſneſs,</hi> Self-Confidence, and ſpiritual Pride, ſo hazardous and ſo natural to vain Man.— We learn likewiſe the Neceſſity there was of the Proteſtant <hi>Reformation;</hi> the Unreaſonableneſs and Dangerouſneſs of the preſent <hi>Defection</hi> from it (in Point both of Opinion &amp; Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice) ſo viſibly prevalent in many Parts of the World call'd <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;</hi> and the Improbability of a general Revival of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> Intereſt, without a general Revival of the true <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Spirit and Principles.— We moreover learn the <hi>pitiable Caſe</hi> of Multitudes of Souls in the Chriſtian World, that are under the Diſadvantage of having no other or little better than <hi>Popiſh</hi> Guides; who by their corrupt, unfaithful, or unſkilful Miniſtry ſooth and flatter them in a Way of <hi>Self-Righteouſneſs,</hi> cheriſhing the Spirit of the <hi>Old Covenant</hi> and thwarting that of the <hi>New,</hi> to the no little Hazard of their eternal Intereſts.</p>
            <p>Again, We have awful Ground from what has been ſaid, to fear, that the <hi>Number</hi> of true Believers in the profeſſing World, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively very <hi>ſmall;</hi> in that Multitudes diſcover a prevalent Spirit and Principle the Reverſe of that of the <hi>Prophet</hi> and <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> whoſe Examples were recorded for our Admonition; and ſo few appear heartily concurring to the Saints united Confeſſion in Diſparagement of <hi>their own Righteouſneſs.</hi>— We ſhall do wiſely to <hi>examine</hi> into our own Sentiment and Diſpoſition of Heart con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>our own Righteouſneſs,</hi> and very ſeriouſly inquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have the <hi>ſame Mind</hi> in us, as was in theſe humble Saints, whoſe <hi>Renunciations</hi> of their own Righteouſneſs we've been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon.— And ſuch as are conſcious they were never bro't to look upon <hi>their own Righteouſneſs</hi> as <hi>filthy Rags</hi> or <hi>as Dung,</hi> and accordingly to renounce it in Point of Dependance upon it for <hi>Juſtification of Life,</hi> may by the Light of thoſe Examples in our Text ſee their <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Self-Confidence</hi> detected and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.— Theſe Examples read Leſſons of <hi>Reproof</hi> to the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God,</hi> who are often too indulgent to Unbelief and ſpiritual Pride, ſad Remains whereof in various Degrees are found even in the Regenerate; but much more to ſelf-deluding <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> who (notwithſtanding all their ſeeming Experiences &amp; moral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finements)

are ſtill unhappy Strangers to that Faith and Self-denial requir'd in the Goſpel, and are under the full Dominion of ſpiritual Pride and Unbelief; and moſt of all to thoſe <hi>groſs</hi> Diſſemblers in Religion, who conſciouſly live in the habitual Practice of Sin, but for a Diſguiſe put on a Profeſſion of Godlineſs and make a Shew of virtuous Action, in ſome particular Inſtances. If the <hi>real</hi> Righteouſneſſes of truly good Men, by Reaſon of their Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, are comparatively but as <hi>Dung</hi> or <hi>filthy Rags,</hi> much more ſo are the heartleſs Duties of unregenerate Moraliſts, and ſtill more ſo the <hi>feigned</hi> Righteouſneſſes of deſigning <hi>Hypocrites.</hi> Prov. 21.27. <hi>The Sacrifice of the Wicked is Abomination: How much more when he bringeth it with a wicked Mind?</hi> — But ſtill how much more abominable and filthy is <hi>Unrighteouſneſs</hi> or <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> itſelf! How malignant an Evil is <hi>Sin,</hi> that ſtains and blemiſhes the very <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſes</hi> of Saints! How odious and pernicious then is <hi>reigning Sin!</hi> more ſo than the <hi>Poiſon of Aſps,</hi> which can but kill the Body, when Sin deſtroys the precious Soul! But above all, what a dreadful Sin is habitual and final <hi>Unbelief,</hi> which binds on the Guilt of other Sins and the Curſe of the Law, and conſigns the Sinner over to eternal Damnation, without a Remedy! <hi>The Sting of Death is Sin, and the Strength of Sin is the Law.</hi> How vile the Character, how miſerable the State, of the unrenew'd and unpardon'd Sinner!</p>
            <p>But to conclude,</p>
            <p>Let what has been ſaid awaken us all to a juſt Concern, <hi>that we may win Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>be found in him; not having for our Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs that which is of Law</hi> (inherent in our ſelves and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect) <hi>but that which is of God by Faith.</hi> Let us often review the Examples of the Prophet and Apoſtle, and learn of them to renounce <hi>our own</hi> defective <hi>Righteouſneſſes, as filthy Rags</hi> and as <hi>Dung,</hi> comparatively to CHRIST'S ſpotleſs perfect Righteouſneſs, and relatively to <hi>Juſtification of Life.</hi> A deep abiding Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this great Truth will have a happy Tendency, to make Chriſt precious to us, and excite us to live by the Faith of the Son of God; to raiſe our Admiration of the Love of God in Chriſt, and inſpire us with humble Gratitude; to fill us with ſelf-abaſing Thoughts, and make us humble in all our Approaches to the Throne of Grace; to put us upon juſtifying God in his afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Diſpenſations, and being contented with all the Allotments of his holy Providence; to teach us Charity, Meekneſs and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance towards our Fellow-Chriſtians; and in a Word, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame our Deſires after another and better Country, even an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, where our perſonal Righteouſneſs ſhall no more be pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted

and diſgraced by the Remains of Sin, but be perfect and immaculate as that of the Angels of God, and we ſhall ſhine forth as the Sun in the Kingdom of our heavenly Father.—Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be much in ſtudying this profitable Subject, and much in Prayer to God, that he would open our Underſtandings to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Scriptures referring to this important Point of Truth, and give us, of his Grace, to feel the Force &amp; experience the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of an effectual Perſuaſion: that a <hi>ſelf-righteous</hi> Spirit may be ſubdu'd in us, and a humble <hi>Faith</hi> towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt may be ingenerated, invigorated, and actuated in us by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, and made to exert its Influence upon us, for the daily increaſing Mortification of Sin and Self, and for the promoting a Life of Communion with Chriſt and Devotedneſs to him, as well as Dependance upon him.— For we ſhould always be mindful, that Chriſt is the Object of our <hi>Obedience,</hi> as well as of our Faith; and that he is of God made unto us, not only <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> but <hi>Sanctification.</hi> While therefore, in Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of imputed Righteouſneſs &amp; in Reference to Juſtification before God, we renounce all our own imperfect Righteouſneſs as <hi>Dung</hi> and as <hi>filthy Rags,</hi> yet nevertheleſs let us at the ſame Time be careful to preſerve and expreſs a due Honour and Regard for <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Holineſs,</hi> as valuable on other Accounts and uſeful for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ends. Let us not fail to realize the Stability of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Law as a Rule of humane Life, our indiſpenſable Obligation to Obedience, and the abſolute Neceſſity of practical Godlineſs and Honeſty; tho' not with any View to our acquiring a Right to Pardon and Peace with God, yet with a View to the Glory of God concern'd therein, with a View to our being <hi>meet for the Maſter's Uſe</hi> here and for his bliſsful Preſence hereafter, and with a View to evidencing the Sincerity of our <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſo the Truth of our Pretenſion to be at <hi>Peace with God:</hi> Becauſe, as it is the Office of Faith to apply Chriſt's Righteouſneſs for <hi>Juſtification,</hi> ſo it is the Nature of Faith to rely on his Strength and Grace for <hi>Sanctification,</hi> and by Motives from the Love of Chriſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain us to Obedience. So that if our Faith be not ſuch as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifies the Heart and works by Love, it wants the eſſential Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of a true <hi>juſtifying Faith.</hi>— As therefore we would <hi>follow Holineſs</hi> to any Purpoſe, let us in the firſt Place be ſolicitous to <hi>obtain like precious Faith</hi> with that of the Apoſtles and Prophets and other Scripture-Saints, who of old <hi>thro' Faith wrought Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs,</hi> while yet at the ſame Time they thro' Faith ſought Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by CHRIST'S <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> only, and renounc'd all Hope of Acceptance and Reward meerly on Account of <hi>their own

Righteouſneſs.</hi>—As a Means to ſtrengthen our <hi>Faith,</hi> and ſo to promote our <hi>Obedience,</hi> by invigorating it's moſt effectual <hi>Principle,</hi> let us with a Dependance on the <hi>Spirit of Holineſs</hi> for his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Influence, be much in meditating and applying the <hi>Truth which is after Godlineſs,</hi> one Article whereof is that which has been employing our Tho'ts.</p>
            <p>It is a remarkable Paſſage, to our Purpoſe, that in TIT. 3.8. <hi>Theſe Things I will that thou affirm conſtantly, that they which have believed in God, might be careful to maintain good Works: theſe Things are good and profitable unto Men.</hi> The Apoſtle had juſt before been opening the Doctrine of Grace, in ſome of its moſt important Branches, and theſe Things which he had now been ſaying, he would have <hi>Titus</hi> to confirm and inculcate in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, to the End that Believers might by theſe Truths be put upon a Care to excell in good Works.—With this View then, let us be much in meditating upon this Doctrine, firmly believe, and wiſely apply it. Let us purſue it to its genuine Purpoſes, to eſtabliſh our <hi>Faith</hi> in Chriſt, and thereby to promote our <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> which indeed, if it be not the <hi>Obedience of Faith,</hi> will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be pleaſing to God nor profitable to us. Faith muſt be the Principle of all our Duties: Faith muſt begin &amp; carry them on: and when we have done our beſt, "we muſt carry them to Chriſt (as Mr. WILLARD expreſſes it) that they may be offer'd up with <hi>his ſweet Incenſe,</hi> and that ſo the <hi>Dung</hi> of them may not procure them to be rejected."</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Now the God of Peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus, that great Shepherd of the Sheep, through the Blood of the everlaſting Covenant, Make you perfect in every good Work, to do his Will, working in you that which is well-pleaſing in his Sight through Jeſus Chriſt; to whom be glory for ever and ever.</hi>
