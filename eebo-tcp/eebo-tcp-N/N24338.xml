            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ACCOUNT, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE following account of the erection of a Poor-houſe, in the pariſh of Boldre, in New-Foreſt, is intended to ſhew, how cheaply, and yet how comfortably, the poor of a pariſh may be maintained, with good management, under the preſent poor laws.</p>
            <p>The old poor-houſe of Boldre being a wretched place, and managed without any economy, at a great expence; it was determined, at a veſtry held in the year 1792, to build a new one on a better ſite; to put in a reſpectable maſter and miſtreſs; and to give the overlooking of it to a monthly Committee of the gentlemen and farmers of the pariſh.</p>
            <p>Accordingly they borrowed the ſum of 800<abbr>l.</abbr> and bought a piece of ground, about two acres and an half; elevated, dry, and airy; here they built their houſe, at a little diſtance from the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:032194_0003_0FF17DB128D4C240"/>road; and yet near enough to be under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant eye of obſervation. It is built ſubſtancially of brick, ſingle, that the air may have a free paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage through it, and extending about eighty-two feet in front, and twenty in breadth. Theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions give an excellent work-room on the right, as you enter; and on the left a kitchen and back kitchen; the maſter's room, which is alſo the Committee-room, about eighteen feet by four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, occupies the centre, and has a window on one ſide, inſpecting the work-room; and another on the oppoſite ſide, inſpecting the kitchen; above ſtairs, the ſleeping chambers are ſeparated nearly as thoſe are below; only, as there are commonly more women and children in a poor-houſe than men, a room at the end of the mens' apartment is taken off for a ſick room, with a ſeparate ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe; above the chambers are excellent garrets; behind the kitchen-part of the houſe, are the pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and other conveniences, among which is a ſtore-room thirty feet long.</p>
            <p>The ground between the houſe and the road, which is a falling ſpace of about ſixty yards, is divided, firſt into a dry convenient play-yard for the children; and the remainder, about half an acre, running down to the road, is a garden; the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032194_0004_0FF17DB5590A1C48"/>larger garden, which is about an acre, lies behind the houſe.</p>
            <p>The houſes being thus erected and ſufficiently dry, the inhabitants of the old houſe, conſiſting of nine or ten men and women, and between twenty and thirty children, were brought into it, on the 19th of May, 1793; and the whole put under the care of Mr. and Mrs. Salter, whoſe characters will hereafter be ſhewn at large in the excellent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of every part of the inſtitution.</p>
            <p>A more diſorderly ſet in every particular, than this family was, when Mr. Salter received it firſt under his care, cannot eaſily be conceived: when he had brought them a little into order, and ſhewn them it was his wiſh to be kind and friendly to them; he got them, by degrees, to go on regular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the buſineſs, and duties of the houſe. Both he and his wife are well acquainted with the whole buſineſs of ſpinning and weaving; and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet up a couple of looms, and a number of ſpinning wheels, he generally preſides over this part of the buſineſs himſelf, and Mrs. Salter over the economy and management of the houſe; both departments are admirably conducted. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants are all employed in that buſineſs they are moſt fit for: ſome of the old women in cook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032194_0005_0FF17DB82BF87070"/>mending, and waſhing; the old men in the garden; the children and ſome of the women in ſpinning, and weaving; children, even of four or five years of age are employed, and earn about a penny a day. In ſummer they come to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room at ſix; in winter as ſoon as it is light; at breakfaſt they have an hour's reſpite, and the ſame at dinner; they have all taſks, which are ſo eaſy, that if they work hard, they can finiſh them by two in the afternoon; but without any exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by ſix.</p>
            <p>With regard to their food; on <hi>Sunday</hi> they have beef, pork, or veal, as each happens to be cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, with plenty of vegetables, and four ounces of bread for grown perſons, and three for children; on <hi>Monday,</hi> they have the remains warmed with vegetables and bread; on <hi>Tueſday,</hi> each grown perſon has a pound of pudding, and the children three quarters of a pound; on <hi>Wedneſday,</hi> beef, or pork, or veal, as on Sunday; on <hi>Thurſday,</hi> the remains as on Monday; on <hi>Friday,</hi> they have generally ſoup made of a bullock's head, with vegetables and bread, as uſual; on <hi>Saturday,</hi> a clearance is made of all the remains in the houſe; and if they fall ſhort, the deficiency is made up with bread and cheeſe; for breakfaſt, beef-broth, or milk-broth is provided; and at ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032194_0006_0FF17DBA0F2B4148"/>the regular meal is ſix ounces of bread, and an ounce of cheeſe for every grown perſon; and for children, four ounces of bread, and three quarters of an ounce of cheeſe; this is ſometimes varied with potatoes, which the children like bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; every thing is good in its kind: the children ſeldom eat up all they are helped to, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder is fryed up again the next day among the <hi>remains.</hi> During the preſent ſcarcity of bread-corn, Mrs. Salter hath uſed a leſs proportion of wheat, and a larger of potatoes, particularly for ſupper. During the winter of the year 1795, ſhe boiled potatoes and onions, and mixing them well together, fryed them with a little lard; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were in general fonder of this diſh than of their uſual meal.</p>
            <p>Four buſhels and a half of malt are allowed each month for beer. I muſt add, that the maſter and miſtreſs generally fare as the family does, though it is not required by the Committee.</p>
            <p>The clothing of the poor is equally good; every one has a new ſuit for Sunday, generally ſpun and woven in the houſe. It is carefully hung up at night, and the old clothes produced for the week.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:032194_0007_0FF17DBBEA1285E8"/>
Thus the poor are well lodged, well fed, and well clothed; and yet, on deducting their earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, at leſs than half the expence they coſt the pariſh before. Their food, upon an average, is ſcarcely ever eſtimated at ſo much as nine pence a head weekly; whereas in the old houſe, with continual complaint, the allowance was juſt dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; though proviſions, at that time, were much cheaper than they are now</p>
            <p>In the article of clothing, much more is ſaved. Though the poor are now ſo decently clad, yet by care and management, the whole expence of the clothing this laſt year, including ſhoes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted only to 17<abbr>l.</abbr> 6<abbr>s</abbr> 8<abbr>d.</abbr> whereas the expence of cloathing the poor in the old houſe, did not amount to leſs, one year with another, than 70<abbr>l.</abbr> annually. In one year it reached 90<abbr>l.</abbr> And this might poſſibly be without any diſhoneſty on the part of the pariſh-officers; for as there was no care taken to keep the clothes in repair, nor any diſtinction made between old and new, the poor were always in rags, and yet always craving for new clothes.</p>
            <p>Another great ſaving, where there is a well regulated houſe, is made in the article of <hi>out-doors-poor.</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:032194_0008_0FF17DC00123BB98"/>There are numbers of people in every pariſh, who are too proud to go into a poor-houſe, or may perhaps be under no neceſſity, who are yet very ready to receive a weekly dole of a ſhilling, or eighteen pence a week: their plea is, if you cannot take us into a houſe, you muſt maintain us out of one. When this plea is cut off, numbers of them find the means of maintaining themſelves; ſeveral indeed, under the character of <hi>out-doors-poor,</hi> every pariſh <hi>muſt</hi> maintain; but the offer of a good houſe draws a line between thoſe who ought, and thoſe who ought not to have this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence. In the old houſe the expence of the <hi>out-doors-poor</hi> was about 8 or 9 pounds monthly. It is at this time only 1<abbr>l.</abbr> 12<abbr>s.</abbr>
            </p>
            <p>Another article of ſaving is in the health of the poor. In the other houſe there were often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious fevers, and other diſorders, from the cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and naſtineſs of the place, and its inhabitants; and though a pariſh doctor was regularly paid, yet the expence for wine and other cordials, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary, or unneceſſary, was often conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable; whereas the airineſs and cleanlineſs of the preſent houſe—the good clothing—the whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomeneſs, and plenty of proviſions, together with the care taken in keeping the family clean, have, under God, ſuch an effect upon their health, that
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032194_0009_0FF17DC300011940"/>no epidemical diſorder, or indeed diſorder of any kind, has appeared among them. The face of the pariſh-doctor is hardly known.</p>
            <p>To all theſe articles of ſaving may be added, the care and integrity of the maſter and miſtreſs. Every thing makes the beſt end; the very crumbs from cutting the bread for each meal are put into the milk or broth, or whatever is next prepared; and this is the more praiſe-worthy, as neither the bread nor meat is in any ſhape farmed to the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; ſo that what he does, is done entirely from an honeſt principle of ſerving the pariſh. It would not indeed be difficult for him, if he were ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, to turn much to his own advantage; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as he keeps the accounts of the pariſh; for which he is well qualified, both by his ſkill and his integrity.</p>
            <p>By all theſe modes of care, economy, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity, together with the profits of the houſe-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, a ſaving in the poor rates of the pariſh was made, this year, of 157<abbr>l.</abbr> 1<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr> notwithſtanding the advanced price of proviſions, and a variety of expences, neceſſary in a new eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Without doors</hi> things are managed with the ſame care and order. Both the gardens belonging to
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032194_0010_0FF17DC5D73D66E0"/>the houſe are in the higheſt degree of cultivation, and bear ſuch quantities of potatoes and cabbage, the chief vegetables uſed in the family, that the maſter finds he is not only ſufficiently ſupplied, but has enough to feed his hogs, and often to give away to his poor neighbours. A theft, one night, was committed in the gardens, and at leaſt two hundred weight of cabbages carried off. When ſomebody was bemoaning the loſs to the maſter, "It was a pitiful thing, he obſerved, to ſteal from a pariſh work-houſe; but in the light of an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to him, it would have been none, if they had carried off twice as much." His ground is ſo well dunged, and ſo productive, that among a number of large cabbages, he had the curioſity to weigh one that ſeemed larger than the reſt, and found its weight to be twenty-ſeven pounds, after the outſide leaves had been ſtripped off. During the ſcarcity of the year 1795, he was obliged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to purchaſe potatoes.</p>
            <p>But the economy of this excellent inſtitution is not more pleaſing than the cheerfulneſs and happy air, with which every thing is conducted. The old women, when they behave well, have little indulgences of tea and ſnuff, which they value much; the men, of tobacco; and the children's
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032194_0011_0FF17DCC954121B0"/>taſks are made pleaſing, by giving them little gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuities out of their earnings. The maſter has the art of turning even their play-hours to uſe; and yet making them more happy, than if they were left to themſelves. If he want the ſtones, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, picked out of the garden, with a ſmall gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity to thoſe who pick the moſt, he ſets ſuch a number of little hands at work, that the buſineſs is ſoon accompliſhed; or, if he want dung brought into the garden, he yokes half a dozen of them to a wheel-barrow, and makes one of them the waggoner, with a long whip, but without the power of exerciſing it. This employment is very pleaſing; it is good exerciſe and preſently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches the buſineſs. If the maſter happen to <hi>have</hi> no employment for them, during their play-hours, he often <hi>makes</hi> it. He will ſend, for inſtance, three or four of them, if the afternoon be fine, to ſome diſtant part of the pariſh, with a letter of no conſequence, but to amuſe them with a walk, and teach them to be truſty in a charge; or, in nutting-ſeaſon, he will ſend three or four of ſuch as he can beſt depend on, to gather nuts in the foreſt; but with condition, that whatever quantity they gather, ſhall be divided with thoſe who ſtay at home. This year (1795) was ſo abundant in nuts, and ſuch quantities were gathered, that Mrs. Salter
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032194_0012_0FF17DCF705D87E0"/>thought it prudent to take the management of ſo large a ſtore under her care, and diſtribute it in doles.</p>
            <p>But none of theſe amuſements are allowed till their taſks are performed. Sometimes in a fine morning the maſter ſignifies his intention of thus employing three or four of them: on which the wheels run with prodigious rapidity, and all buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is over by two in the afternoon. He ſuffers them alſo in ſummer to riſe very early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, before the family is up, and go down quietly to their work, which they are very eager to do. Such work appears like voluntary labour. The condition on theſe occaſions is, not to ſpeak a word till the clock ſtrikes ſix, which is the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed hour. And this condition the maſter ſays, he believes is punctually complied with; he often hears the whirling of the wheels, but no other ſound. Theſe little reſtraints are very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in habituating children to order and decency.</p>
            <p>To <hi>exemplify</hi> the happineſs, which the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals of this well-regulated houſe enjoy, I might produce ſeveral inſtances; I ſhall ſpecify a few.</p>
            <p>Two old women, reduced to the loweſt degree of penury, and really ſtarving, if their neighbours
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032194_0013_0FF17DD10B94B8C0"/>had not aſſiſted them, reſolutely held out, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that they would rather die under a hedge, than go into the poor-houſe. If ſuch a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had been made in the time of the old poor-houſe, they might ſtill have been objects of pity; but at this time it rather cooled the charity of their friends, who indeed thought, that maintaining them out of the houſe was encouraging a diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented ſpirit againſt an inſtitution ſo well conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in every light ſo advantageous to the poor. This had its effect; as winter came on, and fuel grew ſcarce, their pride, which had a great ſhare in their reſiſtance, gave way; and they were driven to ſeek the comforts of a warm kitchen fire at the houſe. A very ſhort time convinced them of their folly, and they ſoon declared, they had never lived ſo comfortably before.</p>
            <p>There was an elderly man in the pariſh, of the name of Brown; he had been bred a thatcher, but was able to work at any kind of labour; he was ſenſible, honeſt, and good-natured in a great degree; and being a ſtout, robuſt fellow, he might have made a very good livelihood; but he was ſo totally careleſs of what he earned, ſo thoughtleſs and imprudent in every reſpect, that he went about in rags, and never knew where to get a
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032194_0014_0FF17DD3E35C4AB8"/>dinner at noon, or a bed at night; indeed he had reduced himſelf at length to ſuch a degree of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and wretchedneſs, that he could hardly crawl about. In this neceſſity, hunger at length drove him into the houſe. Here plenty of good proviſion ſoon recruited him, and he became a uſeful member. To work of no kind he has objection; he digs the garden; he carries out work; he brings meat from the market; often Mr. Salter lets him out to work, on account of the pariſh; in thatching ricks and cottages he is particularly uſeful. The money he earns, he always brings honeſtly home, out of which he receives, for his own uſe, a penny in the ſhilling. In the mean time he is perfectly happy; he is well cloathed, well fed, and well lodged; and as to money, as he never knew the advantages of it, the want of it is no diſtreſs; the few halfpence he receives, he never keeps in his pocket longer than till he has an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of diſtributing them among the children, and old women of the houſe; among whom he is ſo great a favourite, that the latter ſhew their gratitude to him by tricking him out on Sundays with all the neatneſs they are able. He, who uſed to go about the pariſh in rags, not worth picking off a dunghill, now goes to church in a good ſuit of clothes; his breaſt is unbuttoned, and diſplays
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032194_0015_0FF17DD922C317F8"/>a deep ruffle hanging out, neatly plaited; his cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat is well waſhed; and a black ribband is tied round his neck. His ambition and conſequence were one day raiſed, when a ſtranger coming out of the church, and looking with pleaſure on the orderly proceſſion of the work-houſe family, point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Brown, and aſked, if he was not the maſter of the houſe? it ſhould be remembered however, that with all his profuſeneſs, he was mindful, with the firſt money he received, to pay his debts: theſe amounted to four pence, which in ſome preſſure of his affairs he had formerly borrowed, and now remembered. This ſingular character, though he is ſo induſtrious, that Mr. Salter thinks he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains at leaſt four people by his labour, is yet ſo attached to the houſe, that nothing could prevail with him to leave it. His neighbours often tell him, what a fool he is thus to work for other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when he might earn his own money; but Brown is philoſopher enough to know himſelf; and hath had ſufficient experience of the extent of his own prudence, not to truſt himſelf under its direction again, while he can live under the care of ſo kind a maſter.</p>
            <p>But the great merit of the maſter and miſtreſs of this well eſtabliſhed houſe, conſiſts in inſtructing
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032194_0016_0FF17DDBF0342DF0"/>the ignorant, and reforming the abandoned. Every morning, when the bell rings for breakfaſt, the family all aſſemble in the kitchen. Each knows his place; ſo there is no confuſion, and a ſtrict ſilence is enjoined: ſoon after the maſter comes in, and reads, and generally explains (which he is very able to do) ſome eaſy and practical part of the New-Teſtament; after this they all join in prayer. On Sunday morning, and evening, theſe exerciſes are enlarged, and accompanied often with ſinging hymns, in which the children join. They ſometimes ſing hymns alſo at their work, when twenty or thirty ſpinning wheels are all going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The maſter ſays, he would oftener intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſinging hymns at their work; but he judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly obſerves, that the ſlowneſs of the meaſure is too apt to introduce ſlowneſs in their hands. One tune however has particular credit with him, the movements of which are well adapted to the motion of the wheel; and for that reaſon it goes among them by the name of the <hi>ſpinning-wheel tune;</hi> all other ſinging the maſter forbids; which appeared rather hard: his reaſon for it however is good; he has no objection to innocent ſongs; but as he found he could not draw a line between them, and ſuch as were corrupting, he thought it neceſſary to forbid all together. The
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:032194_0017_0FF17DDD88A180D0"/>penalty is the forfeiture of the little earnings of the day from their labour. They regularly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend church on Sundays; and it is a pleaſing ſight to ſee ſo many well clothed figures, happy faces, and healthy countenances, iſſuing from a pariſh-work-houſe. In the afternoon, on Sunday, the children attend the ſchool, where they are cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed with the other children of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: the old people alſo attend with them.</p>
            <p>The good order of the houſe is preſerved rather by rewards than puniſhments. When this family was firſt received from the old houſe, the maſter had occaſion for all his prudence to manage, and bring them into order. Their habits of idleneſs, and wickedneſs were ſo ſtrong, and their ideas of order and diſcipline, ſo weak, that he had great difficulty in preſerving the true medium between too lax, and too ſtrict a government. If he had cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected every thing he ſaw amiſs, he muſt have been continually correcting, and might have irritated, and hardened. His great art, therefore, was to find excuſes for paſſing over many faults; and yet to make the children believe he would paſs over none. When he had informed a boy, for inſtance, that he meant to puniſh him in the evening; his wife, as if ignorant of the matter, would ſend him to bed with the reſt. In the morning he would call up
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032194_0018_0FF17DDF3035B490"/>the boy, and let him know, how angry he was with him, and how ſeverely he would have puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, if his miſtreſs had not ſent him to bed. However, as the matter was now over, he would paſs it by this time. Sometimes, however, to ſhew he was in earneſt, he would puniſh an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary offence with ſeverity; at the ſame time he endeavoured to ſhew that he was much readier to reward, than puniſh, when any thing was done which he approved. Thus by keeping a ſteady hand, and not haſtening the work of reformation too quickly, he brought them by degrees into good order. And when he had once gotten his firſt ſet orderly, it was eaſy to keep up an orderly family. Such as came in afterwards, though ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate and refractory, could not fight againſt ſo diſciplined an eſtabliſhment. Like headſtrong bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locks yoked in an orderly team, they could not well be miſchievous. As his plan is to rule ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by affection, than fear, in which he has been very ſucceſsful, his puniſhments, when he has now brought his eſtabliſhment to this orderly ſtate, are very few, and gentle. They conſiſt chiefly in lock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up delinquents in a room by themſelves, or abridging them of a meal. But theſe happen rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. When he thinks himſelf under the neceſſity of puniſhing a boy corporally, knowing the ill-fame
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032194_0019_0FF12D79C2AE7660"/>which maſters of work-houſes commonly lye under, he chooſes to have ſome reſpectable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon preſent. But he is never driven to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, but in caſes of theft, or other atrocious wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>In this orderly houſe, where all bad examples are removed, and ſcenes only of piety, induſtry, and regularity are before the eye, ſeveral refractory, and ſome abandoned people, have been reclaimed. Among the children, it is hoped, theſe inſtructive leſſons, will have the beſt effect. But among the old people, ſome, who had led looſe, diſorderly lives, (as a foreſt is not the beſt nurſery of virtue) have acknowledged themſelves much happier in a ſtate of decency, regularity, and virtue; and have accordingly changed their manners, and become orderly people; of this two or three inſtances might be given.</p>
            <p>One of the greateſt inſtances of the happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of this houſe, in reclaiming obſtinate wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, was ſhewn in a woman of the name of Young. Her father, a reprobate fellow, had been thrown into Wincheſter jail for deer-ſteeling; and as he could not pay his fine, which was thirty pounds, he was tempted to obtain his liberty, by accepting the poſt of county-hangman, which he
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032194_0020_0FF17DE746EC8988"/>held till his death. Her mother was a noiſy, bawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing woman, who, neglecting her family, uſed to beſet all paſſengers at the bridge, and clamour loud of the hardneſs of the times, and the neceſſities of her family; two or three of whom ſhe uſed gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to produce in rags, to confirm her diſtreſs. The children of ſuch parents could hardly be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to turn out well. The girl, of whom we now ſpeak, had been put to ſchool, with a view to teach her ſome good, and keep her out of more harm. But it had little effect: as ſoon as ſhe could uſe her hands dexterouſly, ſhe began to pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; and with ſuch ingenuity, that it is probable ſhe had learned ſome leſſons from her father's converſation, who had always lodgings among his old friends in the jail, during his periodical excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to Wincheſter. To do him juſtice, however, he ſhewed a laudable fear, leſt his daughter ſhould come judicially under his hands; and has been known to tie her up, and correct her very ſeverely. His ſeverity, however, only turned her from one kind of wickedneſs to another. She next intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced herſelf to a regiment of ſoldiers, who were marching through the country, with whom ſhe lived, till diſeaſe ſent her back to her pariſh. She had now no home, her father and mother being dead. She was ſent therefore to the old poor-houſe,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032194_0021_0FF17DEA1B53AE88"/>which hath been deſcribed as a place not much calculated to produce reformation. When ſhe was cured of her diſorder, ſhe went off again; leading the ſame profligate life ſhe had led be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and this was repeated two or three times. In this ſtate ſhe was brought to the new houſe, which, at firſt, was a ſtate of uneaſy confinement to her. But by degrees, the comfortable life ſhe now led—the recollection of what ſhe had ſuffered—and the ſcenes ſhe had gone through, though ſhe was yet only a young woman, gave her mind a new turn, and ſhe became a thorough penitent. Her credit indeed is now ſo great, that the maſter has made her one of his ſuperintendants over the children at work.</p>
            <p>Thus a happy and uſeful ſociety, for ſuch it may be called, is formed out of the dregs of the pariſh. The old people, having all their wants well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, feel themſelves happier than they ever did before; and are glad to render cheerfully, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, what little ſervices they can. And the child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, bred to induſtry and virtue, ſtand a good chance of being formed, from little profligates, into uſeful members of ſociety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:032194_0022_0FF17DEE81D22408"/>
The pariſh of Boldre will long remember the humanity and integrity, the judicious management, and the religious care of the maſter and miſtreſs, by whoſe means, chiefly, this excellent eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has been ſo happily completed.</p>
            <p>The truth of the above particulars, is atteſted by the three following members of the Committee; two of whom are his in Majeſty's commiſſion of the peace for Hampſhire, and the other is miniſter of the pariſh of Boldre.</p>
