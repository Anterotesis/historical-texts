            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT may perhaps be accounted a bold Diſſent from Cuſtom, if not a Breach of good Manners, to begin an Epiſtle of this Nature without a formal Apology, repreſenting my own Inability, my want of Time for Accuracy, or, that I undertook it with great Reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; and therefore, that all Faults and Imperfections muſt be imputed to thoſe who urg'd me, rather than to my ſelf. But as theſe faſhionable <hi>Prologues</hi> (tho' they commonly diſcover a greater Penetration and Accuracy than the Pieces themſelves, to which they are <hi>annexed</hi>) are ſeldom much regarded, and perhaps rarely ſincere; you will excuſe me if I eaſe you of the Trouble of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing One, before you come to the real Matter and Deſign of this Letter.—</p>
            <p>THE main End of Speaking and Writing (eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when any Thing of a religious Nature and Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is the Subject) ſhould be, to be thoroughly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood—And this End (I am bold to affirm) is what I have aim'd at, how far ſoever I have miſs'd it in what follows.—I have but one Favour to beg, before I acquaint you with my general Deſign; and that is, that you would not look upon it as any deſigned Reflection upon your own Genius, Penetration or Learning, that I have carefully avoided thoſe labour'd Diſtinctions, Criticiſms
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:007862_0003_102DEA1D11E01490"/>
and Niceties, which tend to bewilder and confound, rather than in the leaſt to inſtruct, by far the greater Part of Mankind; who are Strangers to ſcholaſtick Nice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and the various Methods and Arts of Sophiſtry; and are often eaſily puzzled and impoſed upon by the mere Charm of Words, which either have no Meaning at all, or the true Senſe of which they never come at.— What I have principally conſulted is, to diſcover Truth; and expreſs it in a Manner plain and intelligible, even to the loweſt and moſt vulgar Capacity; the Subject being ſuch as equally concerns the High and Low, the Wiſe and Simple, the Learned and Illiterate, to underſtand: —And ſhould this End be anſwered, I ſhall be entirely eaſy, tho' you and the World ſhould judge that here is nothing either learned or new—In a Word, I am far from thinking, and as far from deſiring you ſhould think, that I here preſent you with any Thing worthy of Praiſe and Admiration: An honeſt Meaning is the only Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation it pretends to; which will more effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to every honeſt Man, than the greateſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Learning and Penetration, without this.— Not doubting therefore but that I am writing to a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman highly deſerving of this Character, to one who with an honeſt Heart ſeeks to know the Truth as it is in JESUS; and is not knowingly and willingly under the Influence of any Prejudice or partial Inclination; I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed without further Ceremony to acquaint you, That I have with the utmoſt Application, Seriouſneſs and Candor I am capable of, read and conſidered, the Rev. Mr. <hi>Emlyn</hi>'s <hi>Inquiry into the Scripture Account of</hi> JESUS CHRIST; which you have been pleaſed to dedicate, <hi>To the</hi> Reverend the Clergy <hi>of all Denominations in</hi> New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.— I forbear all Remarks upon your Dedication, and the grand Motive which induc'd you to procure a New-Impreſſion of this Inquiry in <hi>New-England,</hi> 'till I have laid before you my Obſervations upon the Inquiry itſelf,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:007862_0004_102DEA1EBA8D8080"/>
which I ſhall confine to as ſmall a Compaſs as I poſſibly can; and be ſo particular as to omit nothing of your Author's Reaſonings that can be tho't to have any Weight in it; and then perhaps ſuch Remarks will appear more juſt and reaſonable than they might do here.</p>
            <p>I BEGIN with your Author's firſt Chapter, where he propoſes two Things in order to maintain the Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus Chriſt, or his Inequality to God the Father.</p>
            <p n="1">I. "THAT the Term <hi>God</hi> is uſed in Scripture in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent "Senſes, <hi>ſupreme</hi> and <hi>ſubordinate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <q>THAT our Lord Jeſus ſpeaks of <hi>another</hi> as God, <hi>diſtinct from himſelf,</hi> and owns this God to be <hi>above or ever him.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>UPON the Firſt of theſe I would only obſerve, what I ſuppoſe your Author intends by it; which is, that Jeſus Chriſt may be called a God in Scripture, and yet not be the ſupreme God: A Point never yet denied by any who have read the Scriptures.—But it is inquired, whether <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> is not ſtiled <hi>God</hi> in ſuch a Manner, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch Circumſtances, as plainly denote him to be <hi>God ſupreme?</hi> He is in Scripture ſtiled, The <hi>Mighty God,</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Iſai.</hi> ix. 6.</note>— <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> which being interpreted is, <hi>God with us.</hi>
               <note n="b" place="bottom">
                  <hi>chap.</hi> vii. 14. <hi>Matth.</hi> i. 23.</note>—It is affirmed by St. <hi>John,</hi> that the <hi>Word,</hi> i. e. Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>was God.</hi>
               <note n="c" place="bottom">
                  <hi>John</hi> i. 1.</note>—And the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>God was manifeſt in the Fleſh,</hi>
               <note n="d" place="bottom">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 16.</note> meaning Jeſus Chriſt.—St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, He <hi>is over all, God bleſſed for evermore.</hi>
               <note n="e" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> ix. 5.</note>—And St. <hi>John,</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt is the <hi>true God</hi> and <hi>eternal Life,</hi>
               <note n="f" place="bottom">1 <hi>John</hi> v. 20.</note> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi>— Now it is inquir'd, Whether Jeſus Chriſt is not here ſtiled <hi>God</hi> in ſuch a Manner, and under ſuch Circumſtances, as plainly denote him to be God ſupreme?—Your Author allows him to be <hi>Lord</hi> of <hi>Lords</hi> (indefinitely) but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, <hi>that</hi> notes an inferior Character, compar'd with that of <hi>God of Gods</hi>—and refers us to 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.5. for a
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007862_0005_102DEA20D44F5F10"/>
Proof of it:—But how it appears from hence that Jeſus Chriſt is not God, I muſt confeſs is more than I can ſee; ſince we may with equal Propriety thence infer, that the one God is no Lord, as that the one Lord is not God.— If it be ſaid that the Term <hi>God</hi> implies <hi>Lord</hi> alſo, but not the contrary; I anſwer, it by no means follows that Lord of Lords, does not imply God alſo, but that it does; ſince God is a <hi>Lord of Lords,</hi> i. e. Lord of all Lords, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely, muſt therefore be God of all Gods; and if there be no Lord above Him, there is no God above Him, ſince every God is a Lord.—And in this Light the Words of Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> which your Author refers to, appear againſt him, (if fairly cited.) That great Man defines <hi>God</hi> from his Dominion; and obſerves, that conſider'd as the Object of our Worſhip, he is a Lord in the moſt eminent Senſe; and therefore ſhould rather be defined from his Dominion than from his Perfections.—Whenever then we ſpeak of God we conſider him as Lord alſo.—Lord of Lords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely muſt therefore imply God.—Though every Lord is not God, yet the Lord of Lords is God; <hi>this</hi> implies the moſt extenſive Dominion; and if, according to Sir <hi>Iſaac,</hi> we are to define God from his Dominion, what more conciſe and proper Definition can be given of Him than that of Lord of Lords?—If God is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined from his Dominion, what more noble or juſt Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be given of Him than the Apoſtle gives of Jeſus Chriſt, that <hi>he is the bleſſed and only Potentate;</hi> the <hi>King of Kings,</hi> and <hi>Lord of Lords,</hi> &amp;c.? I might add, that Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> was of Opinion, that from true Dominion, it follows that God is living, intelligent and powerful; and therefore as the Apoſtle attributes the moſt extenſive Dominion to Jeſus Chriſt, ſo we may thence infer that he is living, intelligent and powerful in the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Senſe, <hi>i. e.</hi> that he is God of Gods, or God ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme: —But perhaps ſome Men will rather chuſe to conſider Sir <hi>Iſaac,</hi> when he talks at this rate, as a
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007862_0006_102DEA23178437C8"/>
               <hi>Philoſopher</hi> than a <hi>Divine;</hi> for were this allowed it would be of itſelf a compleat Anſwer to your Author as he final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtates the Queſtion, <q>Has Jeſus Chriſt any God over him, who has greater Authority and greater Ability than himſelf or not?</q> certainly <hi>not;</hi> for the Apoſtle evidently attributes the moſt extenſive Authority or Dominion to him; he ſtiles him the <hi>only Potentate</hi>—the <hi>Lord of Lords;</hi> and Power or Ability (according to Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>) follow from true Dominion: None therefore has greater Ability than <hi>he, who</hi> has the greateſt and moſt extenſive Dominion.</p>
            <p>BUT not to purſue this too far—I proceed to obſerve upon Sect. II.—Your Author having ſtated the Queſtion, <q>Has Jeſus Chriſt any God over him, who has greater Authority and greater Ability than himſelf or not?</q>
propoſes hence to demonſtrate the Affirmative, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Firſt, that <q>Jeſus Chriſt expreſly ſpeaks of <hi>another God</hi> than himſelf.</q>—Secondly, That <q>he acknowledges this God to be <hi>above or over himſelf;</hi>
               </q>—And laſtly, That <q>he wants thoſe ſupereminent and infinite Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which belong only to the Lord God of Gods.</q>—</p>
            <p>FOR the firſt of theſe, he refers us to <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.46, where our Saviour cry'd out upon the Croſs, <hi>My God, my God, &amp;c.;</hi> and to <hi>John</hi> 20.17, where after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection he ſent to his Diſciples, (by the Women who firſt ſaw him,) ſaying, <hi>I aſcend unto my Father and your Father, and to my God and your God</hi>—Here I would obſerve, That thoſe who oppoſe your Author, conſider Jeſus Chriſt as Man when thus praying to and ſpeaking of God; that tho' the divine and humane Natures were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited in his Perſon, yet that the humane only pray'd and complain'd to God, &amp;c. and therefore that ſuch Paſſages are no Evidence that he is not truly God ſupreme.—And it muſt be confeſs'd that if there be any juſt Grounds for ſuch an Interpretation, it entirely deſtroys the Force of ſuch Paſſages to prove any thing in Favour of your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:007862_0007_102DEA25907BC9A0"/>
Opinion:—And the plain intelligible Reaſon to be aſſign'd for this Interpretation is, that he is frequently ſtiled God in ſuch a Manner, and under ſuch Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſuch Things are predicated of him, and attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, as more plainly denote him to be the <hi>ſupreme God,</hi> than the Texts your Author refers to denote the <hi>contrary.</hi> Some of theſe I have already mentioned, as, that he is ſtiled <hi>the mighty God, Emmanuel, God bleſſed forevermore, the true God,</hi> &amp;c. without any Limitation or Reſtriction, and in like Manner infinite, unlimited Knowledge is attributed to him:<note n="g" place="bottom">
                  <hi>John</hi> xxi. 17.</note>—And the Knowledge of Men's Hearts:<note n="h" place="bottom">

               <note n="k" place="bottom">John <hi>v. 19.</hi> and onward.</note> — And many other things are predicated of him, which can belong only to God almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:—Not only Men, but Angels, are commanded to <hi>worſhip him:</hi>

Now we muſt either ſuppoſe theſe Repreſentations and Deſcriptions of Jeſus Chriſt to be falſe and groundleſs; or that thoſe Texts which (if literally underſtood of his Perſon) repreſent him inferior to God, are to be interpreted in the Manner mentioned, <hi>viz.</hi> of his human Nature only, and not of his Perſon, which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine: — For it is agreed on all Sides, that thoſe Texts (which if literally underſtood of his Perſon) repreſent Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt as God, and thoſe which repreſent him as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to God, equally belong to the Canon of holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture—The Queſtion is, Which we are to underſtand in their literal and moſt obvious Senſe; thoſe which repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent him as God and equal to the Father, or thoſe which
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007862_0008_102DEA275AC3BEE0"/>
repreſent him as ſubordinate and inferior? for both theſe cannot be underſtood literally, or of his Perſon:—But ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe which repreſent him as inferior to God, muſt be underſtood of his human Nature only, or thoſe which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent him as God, muſt be underſtood of his Office.— The former of theſe I humbly think the moſt reaſonable, <hi>viz.</hi> that thoſe Texts which repreſent Jeſus Chriſt as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to God, are to be underſtood of his human Nature only, and not of his Perſon, which is divine; and that thoſe which repreſent him as God, are to be literally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of his Perſon, that he is <hi>the true God, God bleſſed,</hi> &amp;c. My Reaſons for which are theſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> THAT there is no Propriety in deſcribing Chriſt as to his Office by calling him <hi>God,</hi> according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and ordinary uſe of that <hi>Term</hi> in Scripture, and the general Acceptation of <hi>it</hi> among Men. The Term <hi>God</hi> is uſed and generally underſtood to denote that infinite, eternal, ſelf-exiſtent Being who created and preſerves all Things; and if, with Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> we define God from his Dominion, ſtill the Term (when accompanied by no Reſtriction or Limitation) denotes one that has true, univerſal, underived and everlaſting Dominion; ſuch as is attributed to Chriſt, <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is forever:</hi> And which can belong only to God ſupreme—So that it amounts to juſt the ſame, whether we define God from his Perfections or from his Dominion; ſtill its a very improper and uncommon Uſe of Language to deſcribe Jeſus Chriſt as to his Office by the Term God, without any Reſtriction or Limitation; and much more ſo ſtill to deſcribe him as to his Office, by attributing that to him which belongs only to the ſupreme God. But</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> THERE is not the leaſt Intimation where Jeſus Chriſt is ſtiled God, either in the Texts themſelves, or in what preceeds or follows, that <hi>this</hi> is to be underſtood of his Office, and not of his Perſon.—Where Magiſtrates are ſtiled Gods, the very next Words explain it, and tell us
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007862_0009_102DEA29EEC90530"/>
what we are to underſtand by <hi>it:</hi> And in like manner, where <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Angels</hi> are called Gods, no one, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to the whole Diſcourſe, could eaſily miſtake the Meaning, or not ſee that the Term God was there uſed in an inferior and metaphorical Senſe. But there is no Foundation for this where Chriſt is ſtiled <hi>the true God— God bleſſed forevermore — God whoſe Throne is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forever,</hi> &amp;c. Here is no Room to ſuſpect that the Term God is uſed in an uncommon or improper Senſe, or that it denotes any other than that Jeſus Chriſt is actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally that true God, God bleſſed, &amp;c. he is ſaid to be. Much leſs is there Room for any ſuch Conſtruction where <hi>that</hi> is attributed to Chriſt <hi>which</hi> belongs to the ſupreme God alone: I mean infinite Knowledge, eternal Self-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, religious Worſhip and Homage, &amp;c. which I ſhall ſhew to be diſtinctly attributed to him, in another Place.—</p>
            <p>I proceed to obſerve,</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi> That from what has been ſaid, it appears there is the utmoſt Danger, that ſuch Deſcriptions (if they are to be underſtood of the Office of Chriſt only) will give Men wrong Conceptions of him: They naturally lead us to look upon him as the <hi>true God,</hi> and to adore and worſhip him as ſuch.—And ſurely that God who is jealous of his own Honour, and will not give his Glory to another, i. e. will ſuffer none to receive the Homage and Worſhip which is due to him, nor give his Creatures any juſt Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to look upon any other as God beſides himſelf; HE, I ſay, would never have repreſented Jeſus Chriſt as God, if he was not truly ſuch: He never would have laid ſuch a Snare for us, ſuch a Temptation before us, to eſteem and honour one as God, who is no God.—If it be ſaid, That this Plea holds equally good on the other ſide of the Queſtion, and that there is as great Danger of our contracting too low an Opinion of the Lord Jeſus (if he is truly God) from thoſe Scriptures which repreſent
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007862_0010_102DEA2C0CCA3B20"/>
him inferior to God, as the contrary. I anſwer, That the manifeſt Danger of Deception here is by no means equal;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> BECAUSE the Deſign of our Saviour's coming into the World, and the Miracles which he wrought while manifeſt in the Fleſh, were ſuch as naturally tended to give Mankind (I mean ſuch as believ'd him to be the Chriſt) high and adoring Thoughts of him, and ſuch as would lead them to Reverence and Worſhip him as God, and to give that Honour and Glory to him which is due to God alone; and indeed this Diſpoſition appear'd in thoſe who knew Jeſus to be the Chriſt as ſoon as he was born.<note n="n" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> ii. 11.</note>—And while he was manifeſt in the Fleſh he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently receiv'd Worſhip and Homage from thoſe who were convinced that he was the Chriſt—From the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Samaria,</hi>
               <note n="o" place="bottom">
                  <hi>John</hi> iv.</note> from the Leper,<note n="p" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Matth.</hi> viii. 2.</note> from a certain Ruler, who was a God by Office,<note n="q" place="bottom">Chap. ix. 18.</note> from the whole Ship's Crew,<note n="r" place="bottom">Chap. xiv. 33.</note>
&amp;c.—Thoſe who ſaw his Miracles, and believed on him as the Chriſt, were ever diſpoſed to worſhip, reverence and exalt him. If it be ſaid, that they worſhiped him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they thought him more than a mere Man, even a God—this will favour the Interpretation I maintain, that he is truly God; ſince he never forbid them or told them to worſhip God and not him; that he was their fellow-Servant, and the like; as the Apoſtles conſtantly did, when ſuch Worſhip was offered to them<note n="s" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> x. 26, <hi>and</hi> xiv. 15.</note>: This I think truly obſervable, that our Lord Jeſus never in the leſt ſuppreſs'd or diſcouraged this Diſpoſition in People to reverence and worſhip him: And if he is not God ſupreme, it is to me ſomething unaccountable; ſince I have ever thought Him to be the only proper Object of religious Worſhip; and that to attribute it to any Creature was Blaſphemy, a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing God of his Honor.—But if it ſhould be ſaid, that this was not properly religious Worſhip (which I ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after ſhew in other Inſtances is plainly attributed to Chriſt)
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007862_0011_102DEA2E571A42C8"/>
but a Reverence and Reſpect they paid him as a ſuperior dignified Creature; yet this is ſufficient for my preſent Purpoſe, to ſhew that thoſe who believ'd him to be the Chriſt, knew the Deſign of his Coming, and ſaw his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, had very high and adoring Thoughts of him; which led them to pay him, at leaſt, the greateſt Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and Reſpect that can be due to a mere Creature: This your Author obſerves Pag. 52. (tho' with a different Deſign) is the Caſe with Mankind ſince the Apoſtle's Days, and the ſhutting up of Propheſy: Thoſe who eſteem Jeſus Chriſt as the Saviour of Sinners, are diſpoſed to think and ſpeak very highly of him; and conſequently will much more readily embrace, and eaſily believe, the Deſcription which repreſents Him as <hi>the true God, God bleſſed forever,</hi> &amp;c. than that which repreſents him as a mere Man, inferior and ſubordinate to God, provided theſe Deſcriptions are founded upon equal Authority, as is the preſent Caſe:—So that for this Reaſon 'tis plain there is greater Danger of our being deceived by thoſe Texts which repreſent Chriſt as the true God, &amp;c, if he is not God; than by thoſe which repreſent him as inferior to God, if he is God: This is on Suppoſition that he is as expreſsly, as clearly, and in as unlimited a Manner re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to be inferior to God, by one Part of ſacred Writ, as he is to be God by another Part; which I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly think is not the Caſe; for</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To put the two Deſcriptions or Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Jeſus Chriſt upon an exact parallel, the Queſtion muſt be, Whether he is God or Man? But this is not the Queſtion in debate; it being agreed on both Sides, that he is truly Man; at leaſt, that he was ſo far a Man when manifeſt in the Fleſh, as to be ſubject to all our common Wants, Pains and ſinleſs Infirmities: — But the Queſtion which ariſes is, Whether he was a mere Man, or God-man? Whether he was a mere human Perſon? or, Whether the divine and human Natures were both united in his
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007862_0012_102DEA30071556D8"/>
Perſon? and, Whether he is more plainly repreſented in Scripture as God-Man than as a mere Man? And in this View of the Queſtion, I think there is ſcarce Room to doubt but that Deſcription of Chriſt, which repreſents him as God, is moſt obvious and clear, and has vaſtly the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the <hi>other,</hi> which repreſents him as Man and inferior to God: This will appear plain if we conſider that thoſe Texts which repreſent him as Man, and inferior to God, may be literally underſtood of his Manhood, or human Nature, and not contradict thoſe which repreſent him as God: But the contrary will not hold true, that thoſe which repreſent him as God, may be literally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, if we underſtand the other of his whole Perſon: And it's an eſtabliſh'd Maxim, never to put a figurative Interpretation upon Scripture, where the moſt obvious literal Interpretation is true and conſiſtent; and if this be true, if this be the ſureſt and moſt natural Way of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preting Scripture, it follows that we ſhould underſtand thoſe Texts, which repreſent Chriſt as the true God, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terally of his Perſon; and thoſe which repreſent him as Man and inferior to God, literally of his human Nature, or Manhood only. Upon the whole then; I think it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that was a Man, deſtitute of all Prejudice and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſion, who eſteemed Jeſus Chriſt as the Saviour of loſt Sinners, to read the Bible, and conſider thoſe Scriptures which repreſent him to be truly God, and thoſe which your Author thinks repreſent him as inferior to God; he would be moſt likely to underſtand the former literally of his Perſon, and the other of his human Nature only; and conſequently the Danger of Deception from thoſe Texts, which repreſent Jeſus Chriſt as God, is greater, if he be not God, than the contrary: We muſt therefore, to vindicate the Goodneſs of that God of Truth, by whoſe Inſpiration the Scriptures were given, in not laying a Snare for us, or a Temptation before us, to give that Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Worſhip to another which is due to Himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007862_0013_102DEA31A822F6A0"/>
I ſay, in order to this, we muſt ſuppoſe that Jeſus Chriſt is truly God, and that it's <hi>his</hi> holy Will that all Men ſhould honour the Son even as they honour the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: He gave us the Scriptures to profit us, and not to puzzle, enſnare and confound us:—They are for <hi>Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that the Man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furniſhed unto all good Works,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16, 17, — and not for Riddles, for Deceptions, or Sophiſms, that the Man of Sin may be furniſhed with Ways and Methods to evade the Truth, and maintain Falſehood and Unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. We muſt therefore, if we conſult the Nature and Deſign of the Scriptures, conclude, that the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and literal Interpretation, when conſiſtent with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and common Senſe, and the Scriptures in general, is to be preferr'd to any forced or figurative one whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: And if ſo, then the Interpretation which we put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe Scriptures, which repreſent Chriſt as inferior to God, <hi>viz.</hi> that they are to be underſtood of his Manhood, or human Nature only, is to be preferred to your Author's Interpretation, which ſuppoſes the moſt explicit, unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Aſſertions of the ſupreme Deity of Jeſus Chriſt, and his Equality to God, even the Father, are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of his Office, and not of his Perſon: That he is <hi>the mighty God, the true God, God bleſſed forevermore, God, whoſe Throne is eſtabliſhed forever,</hi> by Office only; that Men and Angels are commanded to worſhip him; that eternal Exiſtence, infinite Knowledge, immenſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are attributed to him, only on Account of his Office, and not for any perſonal inherent Perfections he is poſſeſſed of eſſentially and independently. Your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor indeed attempts very largely to ſhew the Abſurdity of this Interpretation; and that there is no ſuch Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for it as I here ſuppoſe; and his Reaſoning upon this Head I ſhall diſtinctly conſider:—I would only obſerve, at preſent, that in Caſe I ſhew the Vanity and Sophiſtry
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007862_0014_102DEA342A3ADA20"/>
of his Objections, and maintain my Interpretation againſt them; the Conſequence will be, that his Arguments to prove the Inferiority, or Subordination, of Jeſus Chriſt to God the Father, or that he is not truly God, are of no Force: If my Interpretation be juſt, it is an eaſy, plain Solution of all thoſe Texts of Scripture which ſeem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent Chriſt as inferior to the Father:—Thus when he cries, <hi>My God, my God;</hi> and <hi>I aſcend to my God;</hi> it is the human Nature that ſpeaks, and is ſpoken of; it is the human Nature that is diſtinguiſhed from, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Father, or to God, including the whole God-head; ſo he is inferior to the Father, or the Father is greater than he, i. e. than <hi>he,</hi> conſidered as Man, and as Mediator; it being an Act of the greateſt Condeſcenſion in him to become ſuch; but not as to his Perſon and Eſſence, with regard to which, the Son is <hi>true God, God bleſſed for evermore;</hi>—ſo, <hi>the Father hath put all Things under him,</hi> as Man or Mediator, <hi>himſelf being excepted;</hi> for as God, he could receive no ſuch Dominion and Authority; and <hi>when all Things are ſubdued to him,</hi> as Man or Mediator, then, as ſuch, he ſhall be ſubject to God, <hi>who hath put all Things under him, that God may be all in all,</hi> that God may be the Head of the Mediator, the Mediator the Head of the Church, and the Church by him victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous over the laſt Enemy DEATH, and triumphant in Glory; ſo that, as God, his <hi>Throne is eſtabliſhed forever, and his Kingdom ſhall have no end.</hi> This is a plain and eaſy Solution of your Author's irreſiſtable Text 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 24, to 29. And had he took in the two preceeding Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, it would have carried its own Confutation with it; it being very evident from thence that the Apoſtle is ſpeaking of Chriſt as Man: he tells us, Verſe 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, <hi>that as in</hi> Adam <hi>all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live,</hi> i. e. all Men ſhall be made alive in Chriſt; all the Dead ſhall attain to the Reſurrection by him: <hi>Some ſhall ariſe to everlaſting Life, and ſome to Shame and everlaſting
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007862_0015_102DEA374A627A50"/>
Contempt:</hi> He then proceeds to tell us, Verſe 23, in what Order they ſhall riſe,—<hi>But every Man in his own Order, Chriſt the firſt Fruits</hi>—certainly he means the Man Chriſt; and in this Character he diſcourſes of him in the following Verſes, as the firſt-Fruits from the Dead; but I think it renders the Apoſtle very unintelligible, to ſuppoſe that he ſpeaks of Chriſt exactly in this Light, in Ver. 22, where he ſays, <hi>All ſhall be made alive in him:</hi> All who? All Men:—In what Order? The Man Chriſt the firſt:— What! Chriſt be made alive in Chriſt? — Surely, the Chriſt that is the firſt-Fruits, that is made alive from the Dead, is not exactly the Chriſt, in all Reſpects, by or in whom all are made alive: If it be ſaid, that Chriſt is not the Agent, but the Cauſe of the Reſurrection; the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty is no Ways removed, ſince his own Reſurrection is included with that of other Men: And of this Man Chriſt, that is the firſt-Fruits from the Dead, the Apoſtle diſcourſes in the following Verſes, tells us, that <hi>he muſt reign till all Enemies are put under his Feet;</hi> that <hi>the laſt Enemy is Death;</hi> that <hi>God is excepted out of thoſe Things which are put under him;</hi> that <hi>when all Things are ſubdued to him, then he himſelf, this</hi> Man Chriſt, the firſt Fruits from the Dead, <hi>ſhall be ſubject to God, who put all Things under him, that God may be all in all.</hi>—So that if we take the Apoſtle's whole Diſcourſe, there is evidently juſt Ground to underſtand the Words your Author refers to, of the human Nature of Chriſt that was made alive, Verſe 23, and not of his Perſon, in or by whom, that, and all other Men ſhall he made alive, Verſe 22.—As Man, or conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd as the firſt Fruits from the Dead, he ſhall be ſubject to God, who put all Things under him; and as ſuch he is dependent upon God; but conſider'd Perſonally, <hi>he is God, whoſe Throne is for ever and ever, Hebrews</hi> 1.8. But, ſays your Author, the very next Verſe explains this a different Way; where 'tis ſaid, <hi>therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee above thy Fellows;</hi> intimating, that
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007862_0016_102DEA3984D580C8"/>
when conſider'd as <hi>God, whoſe Throne is for ever and ever,</hi> he had a God over him, and is himſelf a God only by Delegation or Exaltation: But how can we underſtand the Words in this Senſe, if his Exaltation is ſo ſoon to end as your Author ſuppoſes? <hi>Thy Throne, O God, is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and ever</hi> — But, <hi>Thy Throne, O God,</hi> ſhall be overthrown at the End of the World; Nay, thô thou art he, (as in Verſes 10, 11.) <hi>who in the Beginning haſt laid the Foundation of the Earth;</hi> thô <hi>the Heavens are the Works of thine Hands;</hi> yea, thô <hi>thou ſhall remain when they are periſh'd,</hi> thô <hi>thou art the ſame when they are changed;</hi>— yet, <hi>they ſhall no ſooner periſh, be folded up, and changed,</hi> than thy Authority and Dominion ſhall ceaſe, and thy Exaltation be at an end: This is evidently the Language your Author makes the Apoſtle ſpeak, when he conſiders him as ſpeaking perſonally of Chriſt in Verſe 9, <hi>therefore God, thy God, hath anointed thee above thy Fellows;</hi> and as this is chargeable with the laſt Degree of Abſurdity, I humbly think we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them of his human Nature: That God <hi>hath anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> the Man Chriſt <hi>with the Oil of Gladneſs above his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,</hi> his Fellow-Creatures, as a Reward for his Love to Righteouſneſs and hatred of Iniquity; but that Chriſt, conſider'd Perſonally, is God, <hi>whoſe Throne is for ever and ever; who laid the Foundation of the Earth, and built the Heavens; and who ſhall remain, and be the ſame when they are periſh'd and changed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND the ſame eaſy and natural Interpretation of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which has hitherto ſhewn the Fallacy of your Author's Reaſoning, entirely deſtroys the Force of his Arguments in <hi>Chap.</hi> II. Thus when our Lord Jeſus ſays, <hi>Of myſelf I can do nothing, John</hi> 5.30; if he ſpoke this with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his Power of Doing or Acting, it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of his Manhood, or human Nature only, the Power of which (as of all other created Beings) was derived from and dependent upon God—But I rather chuſe to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007862_0017_102DEA3B2C77A2F0"/>
think our Saviour ſpake this with regard to his Will; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending by it, that he had no private Will oppoſite to, or ſeparate from the Father's Will—My Reaſon for this is, that he declares Verſe 19, that <hi>what Things ſoever the Father doth, thoſe alſo doth the Son likewiſe;</hi> and Ver. 21, that <hi>as the Father raiſeth up the Dead, and quickeneth them; even ſo the SON quickeneth whom HE will.</hi> Here ſeems to be no want of Power in the Son; he has as great Power as the Father, but their Will is one, he can do nothing of his own Will ſeperate from the Father's; for <hi>whatever the Father does, that alſo does the Son likewiſe</hi>— They are one in Eſſence and one in Will, as appears beyond all Contradiction from Ver. 23. <hi>He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father;</hi> and how can this be true, unleſs the Father and Son are eſſentially one? And this his Oneneſs with the Father he again repreſents in the plaineſt Manner, Chap. 14.9, 10. <hi>He that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father: I am in the Father; and the Father in me</hi>—and intimates Ver. 11, that his Works were enough to convince Men that he was one in Eſſence with the Father, they being ſuch as none but the great God could atchieve — <hi>Believe me for the very Works ſake</hi>—believe what? Certainly what he had juſt aſſerted—<hi>He that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen the Father—I am in the Father, and the Father in me.</hi> And your Author's Suppoſition, that <q>our Lord conſiders himſelf (perſonally) in Oppoſition to the Father,</q>

               <q>Becauſe he ſays the Father had given him all Power or Authority to execute Judgment;</q>—for our Lord tells us in what Character the Father gave him this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and what Capacity he received it, <hi>viz,</hi> as the Son of Man.—He had aſſerted in Ver. 21, that <hi>as the Father, ſo He quickened whom he pleaſed;</hi> and Ver. 23. that <hi>he that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father;</hi> and Ver. 26, that <hi>as the Father had Life in himſelf, ſo

he had given to the Son to have Life in himſelf;</hi> (indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Life, ſurely, or elſe he had given him no more than he has the whole animal, yea the vegetable Creation:)— After our Lord had aſſerted theſe Things, He proceeds to tell us, that <hi>the Father had given him Authority to execute Judgment alſo;</hi> he adds (leaſt any ſhould think there was a Contradiction or Inconſiſtency in his Diſcourſe, in his having equal Power with the Father to raiſe the Dead, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and receiving Power from the Father to execute Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I ſay, that there might be no Room for this, he adds) why, and in what Capacity he received this Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the Father, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe he was <hi>the Son of Man</hi> — therefore the Father gave, and he received Authority to execute Judgment.—But in <hi>ſome other Nature</hi> or Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, he had equal Power with the Father, to <hi>quicken whomſoever he would — had Life in himſelf</hi> — was <hi>One with the Father</hi>—And what could this be, but the <hi>divine?</hi> what but <hi>true God?</hi> — It is ſurprizing to me, that your Author could read theſe Chapters of St. <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, and pick out thoſe Scraps which he brings to ſupport his Cauſe, without being convicted and confounded by the ſurrounding Context, which aſſerts our Saviour's ſupreme Deity and Godhead in almoſt every Verſe.</p>
            <p>I proceed to your Author's</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
               <hi>Inſtance;</hi> wherein he thinks our Lord Jeſus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed a Perfection which belongs only to the ſupreme God, <hi>viz.</hi> That of <hi>abſolute Goodneſs</hi>—which he grounds upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Why calleſt thou me good? There is none good but one, that is God.</hi>— Your Author af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it to be evident, that Chriſt here diſtinguiſhes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from God, and denies of himſelf what he affirms of God.— And even were this the Caſe, the Interpretation I have hitherto maintained is a natural and eaſy Solution, <hi>viz.</hi> That he diſtinguiſhes his <hi>human Nature</hi> from God, and denies of that only what he affirms of God.— But for my Part, I can ſee no Grounds for your Author's
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007862_0019_102DEA4007AEFEC8"/>
Method of interpreting this Text.— I think all muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the Truth of his Interpretation entirely depends upon the Opinion which the young Man had of Chriſt, who received this Anſwer from him. — And this I am ready to think very difficult exactly to determine: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is evidently the greateſt Probability, that he did not look upon him to be God: And if ſo, then the Anſwer he received from Chriſt, may be very fairly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as a Check or Reproof upon him, for attributing that to Chriſt, while he thought him a mere Man, which belongs to God only; — for <hi>as a Man thinketh in his Heart, ſo is he;</hi>— and therefore the young Man was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable for attributing that to him, which belonged not to him in the Character or Capacity he viewed him in; tho' it juſtly belonged to him in his real perſonal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter: —This is undeniable.—And now I humbly think, it moſt probable, that the young Man did not look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Saviour to be God,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe the prevailing Opinion among the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> in general at that Day, concerning the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was, not that he ſhould be <hi>God manifeſt in the Fleſh,</hi> but a mere Son of <hi>David,</hi> a temporal Prince and Saviour; and if the young Man tho't him to be the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> yet that his Opinion of him, was agreeable to the common <hi>Phariſaical</hi> Notion of the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> is altogether probable; ſince he was one from among the Multitude; and there is not the leaſt Intimation that he thought dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently of Chriſt, from what the Reſt tho't of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſiah</hi> in general. Nothing can be infer'd concerning his Opinion of him, from the Queſtion he aſks him, more than this, That he thought him, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> did, <hi>A Teacher come from God;</hi> or one able to inſtruct him.</p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> WHAT very much confirms it, that he did not take our Saviour to be God, is his Conduct after he had received Inſtructions from him, — <hi>He went away
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007862_0020_102DEA4303117A08"/>
ſorrowful.</hi>—What! That he had been inſtructed Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately from the Mouth of God?—No; That the Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were ſo oppoſite to his darling Luſt: But would any Man who had Reaſon and ſober Thought enough to frame an Opinion any Way, if he verily believed that the great God immediately enjoined a Thing upon him, dare to neglect it? Or, would a Man thus believingly taught from God's own Mouth, go away ſorrowful, that he muſt deny himſelf one Thing to pleaſe this God? No verily; a Man that would act at this Rate, muſt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned to the greateſt Degree of Hardneſs and Stupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity: But the Character of this young Man is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently repreſented: He <hi>had kept,</hi> at leaſt externally, the <hi>ſecond Table</hi> of the moral Law <hi>from his Youth;</hi> was inquiſitive <hi>what he ſhould do to be ſaved;</hi> yea, he was a Youth of ſo much Innocence and Vertue, that our Saviour <hi>loved him:</hi> In ſhort, He <hi>lacked but one Thing</hi> to make him a good and perfect Man in the Senſe of Scripture; and ſurely he would not have lacked this one Thing, had he verily believed the great God from his own Mouth recommended it to him.</p>
            <p>Beſides,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> IF our Saviour knew the young Man tho't him to be God, and was conſcious to himſelf at the ſame Time that he was not God, (as your Author ſuppoſes) I ſay, if this be the Caſe, it's difficult to aſſign a Reaſon for his anſwering him in this Manner; <hi>Why doſt thou call me good? there is none good but One, that is God.</hi>— This implies only an Inquiry why he called him Good; <hi>i. e.</hi> upon what Account; and not a Denial that he was Good: He affirms that <hi>none is good but God;</hi> but this is not denying himſelf to be God.— Had he deſigned ſuch a Thing, if his Manner of Expreſſion is not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unintelligible, it's evidently very liable to be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood, and but little favours ſuch a Deſign.— Had he deſign'd to have cured the young Man of a Miſtake,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007862_0021_102DEA44A8538838"/>
in thinking him God when he was not, would he not rather have plainly told him, I am not God; or you are wrong in calling me Good?— But on the other Side, It is eaſy to aſſign a Reaſon why our Saviour did not more fully declare his God-head to this young Man.— The captious deſigning Phariſees were about him, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Occaſion and Opportunity to accuſe him; but as <hi>His Time was not yet come,</hi> he was careful to give them none, that their Ignorance, Ill-nature and Prejudice could poſſibly improve againſt him at that Time. But what Improvement they would have made of it, had he aſſerted himſelf to be God, we may learn from the Account given of his Accuſation and Tryal, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26. and <hi>Luke</hi> 22. When he intimated before the <hi>Sanhedrim,</hi> that he was <hi>the Son of God,</hi> the general Cry was, <hi>What need we any further Witneſſes? for we our ſelves have heard of his own Mouth.</hi> And, John 5.18. <hi>The Jews ſought the more to kill him, becauſe he ſaid, that God was his Father; making himſelf equal with God,</hi> as they interpreted it: And our Saviour is ſo far from denying abſolutely that their Interpretation was right, that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately aſſerts his Oneneſs with the Father; tho' in ſuch a Manner as to prevent their making an immediate Improvement of it againſt him:—He ſays, <hi>What Things ſoever the Father doth, theſe alſo doth the Son likewiſe.</hi> From hence it appears, that our Saviour carefully avoided ſuch Expreſſions as that even the Phariſees themſelves could judge ſufficient to accuſe and condemn him by, till his Time or Hour was come; and therefore thought not proper to aſſert his Divinity, or God-head, in plain, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Terms to the World; not even till <hi>He was decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be the Son of God with Power, by a Reſurrection from the Dead.</hi> — And this, if I miſtake not, lets us into the Foundation and Deſign of that Charge our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour gave his Diſciples, <hi>Matth,</hi> 16.16. and <hi>Luke</hi> 9.22. When <hi>Peter,</hi> (ſpeaking the Sentiments of the other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,)
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007862_0022_102DEA465AB6CE60"/>
declared him to be <hi>Chriſt the Son of God;</hi> i. e. God by <hi>Nature,</hi> and not merely by <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Delegation:</hi> He ſtrictly charged and commanded them, that <hi>they ſhould tell no Man</hi> that <hi>Thing:</hi> But why? What is the Reaſon of this Charge? HE adds, <hi>Becauſe the Son of Man,</hi> (not the Son of God moſt properly and by Way of Eminence ſo called,) <hi>muſt ſuffer many Things, and be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected of the Elders and chief Prieſts and Scribes:</hi>—Intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing certainly, that it was inconſiſtent with the Purpoſes of infinite Wiſdom, and his then preſent State of Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and approaching Sufferings, that HE ſhould be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly preached and proclaimed to be <hi>what He really was,</hi> and what his own Diſciples <hi>thought Him to be:</hi> — And no wonder; when he gave his Diſciples ſuch a Charge not to proclaim the <hi>Dignity of his Perſon,</hi> and his <hi>real Character,</hi> till after his Sufferings, that he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline doing it himſelf.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole then; From what has been ſaid, it appears (if not very plain yet) moſt probable, that the young Man did not look upon <hi>Chriſt</hi> to be <hi>God:</hi> — That our Saviour's Anſwer, <hi>Why doſt thou call me Good?</hi> &amp;c, is to be underſtood as a Check, or Reproof, upon the young Man, not for his Words ſimply conſidered; but for his applying them to Chriſt, while he entertained his then preſent Opinion of him: I ſay, that his Anſwer is to be underſtood in <hi>this</hi> Light; and not as a Denial of his own Goodneſs or Deity, ſince the Words do not plainly expreſs any ſuch Denial: And no Reaſon can be offered why our Saviour ſhould not plainly expreſs it, if this was his Deſign: But on the other Hand, that there is good Reaſon why he did not abſolutely aſſert and publickly declare his Divinity <hi>at that Time;</hi> ſuch a Declaration be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inconſiſtent with the Purpoſes of infinite Wiſdom, the State of Humiliation he was in, and the Scene of Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings he had to paſs thro'. — So that if we are to judge according to the greateſt Degree of Evidence and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:007862_0023_102DEA48A2672100"/>
Teſtimony, we muſt judge that there is no ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Ground for your Author's Interpretation of our Saviour's Anſwer to the young Man. —</p>
            <p>I proceed to the</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and laſt <hi>Inſtance,</hi> wherein your Author ſuppoſes our Lord diſclaimed a Perfection which belongs to the <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme God,</hi> viz. Mark 13.32. <hi>Of that Day knows no Man; no, not the Angels of Heaven; nor the Son; but the Father.</hi> — This I look upon to be the moſt plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Argument in favour of your Author's Opinion. As to <hi>the other</hi> Inſtances he produces, if we conſider their obvious Circumſtances, and the general Current of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they are no Ways to his Purpoſe;— and even <hi>this</hi> is fairly over-balanced by other Scriptures, which affirm in the moſt poſitive, unlimited Manner, that <hi>He knows</hi> all <hi>Things;</hi>—that <hi>He ſearcheth the Reins and the Hearts,</hi> &amp;c.— For this is not a poſitive Aſſertion that he did not, perſonally conſidered, <hi>know the Day and Hour;</hi> — but, <hi>of that Day and Hour knoweth no Man; no not the Angels; nor the Son,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> or the <hi>human Nature:</hi> He did not then know it, conſidered as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and Teacher of Mankind: It was what he could not then reveal in this Character; it being kept as an invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Secret from all created Beings; what no ways con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned them to know; yea, the Knowledge of which would be dangerous and hurtful, for the Reaſon aſſigned: For this bring kept ſuch a Secret is, that <hi>All</hi> might <hi>Watch:</hi> A Duty that would in a great Meaſure be ſuperſeded by a Revelation of that Day and Hour: Therefore, <hi>of that Day and Hour</hi> muſt <hi>no Man know; no, not the Angels; — nor the Son,</hi> conſidered as Man; or the Prophet and Teacher of Mankind: This I think a plain and natural Solution of theſe Words, in conſideration of the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances attending them, and thoſe other Scriptures, which poſitively affirm, that our Lord Jeſus <hi>knows All Things;</hi> that <hi>He ſearcheth the Heart,</hi> &amp;c. — That they are to be
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:007862_0024_102DEA4AC2EC8130"/>
underſtood of Him conſidered as <hi>Man,</hi> or the Prophet and Teacher of Mankind, and not Perſonally. — I have therefore nothing to do now in order to maintain my Cauſe, but to remove your Author's Objections againſt this Interpretation, and the Arguments I have brought to ſupport it. And this I ſhall attempt to do in a brief and familiar Manner, tho' your Author has dwelt very largely upon it; conſcious, that his whole Hypotheſis was depending, and muſt inevitably fall if he failed in this Point.</p>
            <p>HE therefore obejects;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>, <q>THAT our bleſſed Lord Jeſus, if himſelf was the ſupreme God in any Nature of his own, could not have ſaid ſuch Things in any Conſiſtency with Truth and Sincerity:—He could not ſay <hi>Himſelf could not do,</hi> and <hi>did not know,</hi> the Things, which, if he were God ſupreme, he <hi>could do,</hi> and <hi>did know,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
— As to the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> "Our Saviour's ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>He could do nothing of himſelf,</hi>" I have already ſhewn it evident from the Context, that it's to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of his <hi>Will;</hi> that he had no private Will of his own, ſeparate from the Father's; and not of his <hi>Power:</hi> For, <hi>What Things ſoever the Father doth, thoſe doth the Son;</hi> and, <hi>as the Father quickeneth whom He will, ſo doth the Son.</hi>— And, as to the <hi>ſecond,</hi> He does not poſitively deny his <hi>knowing the Day,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>Perſonally</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; but conſidered <hi>as Man;</hi> or in the Character of our Prophet and Teacher.— So that the Queſtion is plainly this, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether our Lord Jeſus, if the divine and human Natures were united in his Perſon, could not affirm, that he did not know <hi>that</hi> as <hi>Man,</hi> or conſidered as our Teacher, <hi>which</hi> he did know, as GOD, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Truth; and this, without any expreſs Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation or Reſerve?— In order to determine <hi>this;</hi> the Time, Manner and Circumſtances of his ſpeaking, muſt be conſidered: For it muſt be allowed, That at one Time,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007862_0025_102DEA4CD96812F8"/>
and under certain Circumſtances, a Reſerve or Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation may be neceſſary to render a Speech conſiſtent with Truth; when at another Time, and under dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Circumſtances, the ſame Speech may be equally true, without any ſuch Reſerve or Limitation's being expreſſed. — This might be illuſtrated, were it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, by various Examples. — The Truth and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of a particular Speech or Sentence often depends upon the Circumſtances of the Time; the Knowledge of the Hearers; or the preceeding or following Diſcourſe of the Speaker: For it's no Argument, that a Man ſpeaks inconſiſtent with Truth, becauſe we miſunderſtand him; or becauſe what he ſays is not true in the Light we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it: If ſo, every Man muſt be a Liar that has the Misfortune to be miſunderſtood; and at this Rate, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſome would make our bleſſed Saviour as great a Liar as the Father of Lies himſelf. — Now to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply this to the preſent Caſe in the moſt familiar Manner: — If the Diſciples underſtood him to ſpeak of his <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature,</hi> or of himſelf conſidered as the Prophet and Teacher of Mankind, and <hi>not</hi> of himſelf <hi>perſonally,</hi> when he ſaid, that <hi>the Son did not know the Day and the Hour;</hi> then with regard to them, his Speech or Saying was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Truth: He did not deceive them; but what he ſaid in the Senſe he intended it, and in the Senſe they underſtood it, might be ſtrictly true, tho' the Son in <hi>another Nature,</hi> or Character, did <hi>actually know,</hi> what is here ſaid he did <hi>not know.</hi>—And if from what is revealed to us concerning our bleſſed Saviour, we have ſufficient Reaſon to conclude, that this of <hi>his not knowing the Day,</hi> is to be underſtood of him conſidered as <hi>Man,</hi> or as our Prophet and Teacher, and <hi>not Perſonally;</hi> then we have no Reaſon to complain or object, that what he ſays is inconſiſtent with Truth and Sincerity: And that we have no ſufficient Reaſon to ſuppoſe this, your Author has not yet proved; and to infer it from the Speech or Sentence
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007862_0026_102DEA4F1FDAC130"/>
itſelf, ſingly conſidered, is abſurd; ſince it's being conſiſtent or inconſiſtent with Truth and Sincerity depends upon the Circumſtances of the Time at which it was delivered; upon our Saviour's whole Diſcourſe with his Diſciples; and upon their Knowledge or Notion of what he ſaid: I ſay, it depended upon all theſe with regard to <hi>them:</hi> And with regard to <hi>us,</hi> it depends upon the whole Record God hath given of his Son. If he has not ſufficiently revealed to us, that this is to be underſtood of his <hi>human Nature</hi> only; but of him <hi>Perſonally</hi> conſidered; then it is true, that ſuppoſing him to be GOD, is making him ſpeak in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Truth. But while he has revealed to us, that it is to be underſtood of him conſidered as <hi>Man,</hi> or our Teacher only, and not of him <hi>Perſonally,</hi> the above Suppoſition implies no Contradiction or Inconſiſtency, with the ſtricteſt Truth and Sincerity.— He that hath told us, <hi>the Son did not know,</hi> &amp;c, hath alſo told us, what we are to underſtand by the <hi>Son,</hi> when this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is denied of him, <hi>viz.</hi> That we are to conſider him as <hi>Man,</hi> as our Prophet and Teacher, and not in his <hi>divine</hi> Nature, as <hi>truly God;</hi> tho' He is to be thus conſidered, when 'tis ſaid, <hi>He knows All Things;</hi> the <hi>Hearts of Men,</hi> &amp;c.— This indeed is not delivered to us in the ſame Words and Terms I have uſed; but it is plainly taught in that Record God hath given of his Son; at leaſt your Author has not ſhewn, that this is not revealed to us by the ſame Scriptures that tell us, <hi>The Son knows not the Day,</hi> &amp;c. So that tho' our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did not make an immediate expreſs Reſerve when he ſaid, <hi>The Son did not know the Day;</hi> yet it amounts to juſt the ſame, if the Diſciples underſtood him with this Limitation; and if the Scriptures, which give us an Account of him, teach us to underſtand thoſe Words in this limited Senſe, it is the ſame Caſe: We have as little Reaſon to complain and object, that his ſaying, <hi>The Son did not know,</hi> &amp;c. is inconſiſtent with Truth, if he
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:007862_0027_102DEA50CFCE0928"/>
be GOD, as if he had immediately added, You are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>this</hi> of me as <hi>Man;</hi> I ſpeak it of the <hi>Son</hi> conſidered as the Prophet and Teacher of Mankind, or the like.— Would it not be a very unreaſonable Criticiſm, for any one to take a ſingle Sentence of a Diſcourſe delivered from the Pulpit, or at the Bar, a Sentence that depended upon what preceeded or followed for its <hi>true Senſe,</hi> or for the <hi>Meaning</hi> which the Speaker intended, being explained and limited to certain Bounds; I ſay, would it not be barbarous and unreaſonable to ſelect ſuch a Sentence; and declare, that becauſe when underſtood in it's utmoſt poſſible Latitude, in a Senſe very different from what the Speaker intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was inconſiſtent with Truth, therefore it was really ſo in <hi>every Senſe,</hi> and cannot be reconciled with the Truth and Sincerity of the Speaker; but is to be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red an abſolute Falſhood? Juſt ſo barbarous and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable is it for your Author to ſelect this <hi>ſingle Sentence</hi> of our bleſſed Saviour and declare, That it is not true of the Son, conſidered in the Light or Character in which he ſpake of him; in which his Diſciples underſtood him; and in which the holy Scriptures teach us to underſtand him; becauſe it is not true of the SON conſidered in his utmoſt Latitude, if he be GOD. — This may be further illuſtrated by the very Inſtances your Author brings to ſupport his Objection: Tho' there is a wide Difference between two Arms, or two Eyes, belonging to one Man, and two infinite diſtant Natures being united in one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; the Caſes are too unlike and unparrallel to prove any Thing of each other, and therefore are not to your Author's Purpoſe, in the Light he conſiders them; but may ſerve to illuſtrate what I have ſaid.—Thus, ſuppoſing a Man to have two Eyes, the one vivid and piercing, by which he could diſcern minute Atoms and Objects at a great Diſtance; the other dull and ſhort-ſighted, affected only by near and ſhining Objects: Suppoſing this Man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing with me concerning the Sight of his pooreſt Eye;
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:007862_0028_102DEA5362141F00"/>
or, being aſked by me, how far, and what Objects he could ſee; ſhould anſwer, "I can ſee no farther than ſuch a particular Object, and there are only ſuch and ſuch large and ſhining Objects that I can diſcern;" would this be inconſiſtent with Truth and Sincerity, becauſe he could and did ſee farther and other Objects with his beſt Eye?—Or, if without any previous Diſcourſe of the Matter, he ſhould ſay, "I don't ſee ſuch and ſuch Things; there are certain Objects I don't diſcern:" But ſhould add, that he meant by his dull ſhort-ſighted Eye; for with the other he could diſcern minute Atoms and Objects at a Diſtance: Could his firſt Aſſertion in this Caſe be juſtly deemed inconſiſtent with Truth, if the latter were true? Surely no; he intended no Falſehood; and I am not deceived: If I take and conſider his whole Diſcourſe together, it appears every Way conſiſtent; and in ſhort, it would argue great Ignorance, Prejudice or Ill-nature in me to object, that it was not true and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent. — And now to apply this to the preſent Caſe.— Suppoſing our Lord Jeſus to have two diſtinct Natures united in his Perſon, <hi>viz.</hi> the divine and human; the <hi>divine</hi> knows all Things, the <hi>human</hi> does not: The Diſciples who are previouſly informed of this double Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, apply to him in the Character of <hi>Man;</hi> or inquire of him as their Prophet and Teacher; not as a <hi>divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, When the Day ſhould be?</hi> He tells them, that <hi>he</hi> (or the <hi>Son) did not know;</hi> while the <hi>divine Nature</hi> or <hi>He,</hi> the <hi>Son,</hi> in a different Character, <hi>did know:</hi> Or without their previous Knowledge of his two Natures, and double Character, (if you chuſe to have it ſo) he tells them, <hi>Of that Day the Son knows not:</hi> but adds, that he intended by <hi>Son,</hi> the <hi>Son of Man;</hi> or the Son conſidered as the Prophet and Teacher of Mankind; for that the Son, as <hi>God,</hi> or a <hi>divine</hi> Perſon, <hi>did know it.</hi> The firſt of theſe Aſſertions cannot be juſtly deemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with Truth, becauſe the latter is true. —And

that the Diſciples either thus underſtood our Lord at the very Time, or were thus inſtructed by him ſoon after, is evident; becauſe they ſoon after attributed infinite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Knowledge to Him: <hi>Lord, Thou knoweſt all Things.</hi>—And they are Examples for us; and we are to conſider the whole Scriptures as one continued Diſcourſe. When we judge of the Perſon, Offices or Religion of our bleſſed Saviour, we are to explain and interpret one Part with another, by the Exerciſe of the beſt Reaſon, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Prejudice or Partiality.—Thus it renewedly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that your Author's Objection is groundleſs; till he firſt ſhews, that <hi>the Record God hath given of his Son</hi> no where affords us ſufficient Grounds to conclude that the particular Sentence or Sentences in debate, are to be underſtood agreable to the above Interpretation.—I have dwelt the longer upon this Point, becauſe your Author lays great Streſs upon it; and indeed founds his other Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections in great Meaſure upon the Suppoſition that this is juſt, true and unanſwerable. Thus largely ſhewing the Vanity of this, will therefore open the Way, and vaſtly facilitate the Removal of the Reſt.—I beg leave however to add, that your Author has laid aſide the Subtilty or good Senſe he ſeems in ſome other Places to be poſſeſſed of, when he makes ſuch a horrid and obvious Abuſe and Miſapplication of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Words, to prove his own Reaſoning fair; and inſinuates, "that ſome on the other Side own it, juſt when out of the Heat of this Controverſy, and contending with the <hi>Papiſts.</hi>" Was I a Friend to your Author's Opinion, or verily believed it reaſonable and true, I ſhould be truly grieved to ſee it vindicated by ſuch a Quibble. — Is there any Room to compare a <hi>Popiſh Prieſt</hi> who falſely pretends to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonate God, to JESUS CHRIST, if he is really God?

Saviour, if the divine and human Nature were actually united in his Perſon, could not know any Thing as GOD, which he did not know as <hi>Man?</hi> Surely there is a wide Difference between <hi>falſely pretending</hi> to be God, and being <hi>really</hi> GOD; or elſe we may make God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty himſelf an Impoſtor: And if here be a <hi>Difference,</hi> then your Author's Reaſoning upon this Head, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the Doctor's Words in his Favour is unjuſt and unreaſonable. But I proceed to,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obj.</hi> 2. <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That Jeſus Chriſt intended no ſuch Diſtinction of <hi>two Natures,</hi> becauſe he puts not the Diſtinction or Oppoſition between the <hi>Son of Man,</hi> and <hi>the eternal Word,</hi> (as ſome ſpeak,) but between <hi>the Son</hi> and <hi>his Father;</hi> not the Son knows, but only the Father. — Which is as much as to ſay, None knows but the Father, and the Son is in no Nature the Father; therefore the Son could not know in any Nature, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q> — I have not here uſed exactly your Author's Words, but taken the whole of his Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. — In <hi>anſwer</hi> to which, I would obſerve, That tho' the Diſtinction or Oppoſition is not expreſly put between <hi>the Son of Man</hi> and <hi>the eternal Word</hi> in the very ſame Verſe, or the next following; yet that the Diſciples under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it <hi>then,</hi> or were taught to underſtand it, with the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction thus put between the <hi>human</hi> Nature and the <hi>divine,</hi> or the <hi>eternal Word,</hi> is evident from their afterwards attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to the <hi>eternal Word,</hi> or Chriſt <hi>perſonally</hi> conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, infinite, unlimited Knowledge: And that we are to underſtand the Diſtinction or Oppoſition thus, is evident from the Current of Scripture; which declares our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour to be <hi>God manifeſt in the Fleſh;</hi> proclaims his <hi>Divinity</hi> and <hi>Equality</hi> with God the Father. — And this I have ſhewn, vindicates our Saviour's Aſſertion, if he was really GOD, from the Imputation of Falſehood or Inconſiſtency with Truth, equally as if he had made an immediate expreſs Reſerve; and by Parity of Reaſon,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:007862_0031_102DEA598E4E2F88"/>
and plain Conſequence, this vindicates him in not putting the Diſtinction or Oppoſition immediately and in expreſs Terms, if he did know as GOD, between the <hi>Son of Man</hi> and the <hi>eternal Word;</hi> or between his <hi>Humanity</hi> and <hi>Divinity</hi> — So that it by no means follows, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour did not intend this Diſtinction of <hi>two Natures,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he does not immediately and in expreſs Terms put the Diſtinction or Oppoſition between the <hi>Son of Man</hi> and the <hi>eternal Word:</hi> There was either no Occaſion of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing this Diſtinction <hi>then,</hi> they knowing it <hi>before,</hi> or he taught it there <hi>preſently after,</hi> and hath ſufficiently revealed it to us by his Word; if diveſted of Prejudice, we with good and honeſt Hearts read and conſider it. — But then, <q>Are not all excepted from this Knowledge, but the <hi>Father</hi> only? How then can the <hi>Son</hi> have it in any Nature?</q> 
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> The general Term of <hi>Father</hi> here comprehends the <hi>whole God-head;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> are included under it, as well as the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>—But how, What Proof or Ground is there to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that by the Term <hi>Father,</hi> we are to underſtand <hi>three diſtinct Perſons</hi> here; and that the <hi>Son of Man</hi> ſtands oppoſed to all theſe included under the Term or Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of <hi>Father? — Anſw.</hi> Becauſe the holy Scriptures tell us, <hi>There are Three that bear Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe Three are One.</hi> —That the <hi>Father and Son are One.</hi>—That <hi>He that hath ſeen the Son hath ſeen the Father.</hi> — That <hi>He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father.</hi> —That the Son <hi>is the true God, — God bleſſed forever.</hi> That He <hi>knows all Things.</hi> — That He <hi>ſearcheth the Reins and the Hearts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> in ſhort, The God-head, or Deity, is plainly repreſented as ſubſiſting in <hi>three diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct Perſons,</hi> who equally partake of the divine Eſſence, and of all natural and moral Perfections; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of <hi>Knowledge.</hi> Hence we conclude, That as all but the Father are excepted from the Knowledge of <hi>that
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:007862_0032_102DEA5C32E34C48"/>
Day;</hi> ſo by the <hi>Father,</hi> is intended the <hi>Deity,</hi> or <hi>God-head,</hi> or all the <hi>three Perſons</hi> in which it ſubſiſts: And this Reaſon remains good, till it be ſhewn, that no ſuch Things as the above-mentioned are contained in the holy Scriptures, that Jeſus Chriſt is not repreſented as GOD equal with the Father; that infinite, unlimited Knowledge is not attributed to Him, <hi>&amp;c,</hi>— which your Author has not done, unleſs his Reaſon and Grounds for ſuppoſing that by the Term or Appellation of FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER, cannot be intended <hi>three diſtinct Perſons,</hi> or the <hi>whole God-head,</hi> if it ſubſiſts in <hi>three Perſons,</hi> is an over-balance, for Reaſons I have mentioned, to conclude the contrary: For certainly the moſt ſubſtantial Reaſon, the greateſt Degree of Evidence and Probability, ought to be followed. Let us therefore view your Author's Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and ſee what Proportion it bears to the other.— His Reaſon then (if I miſtake not) is this, That if the above Method of Interpretation be good and juſt, <q>he ſhould deſpair of ever underſtanding the Scriptures above all Books that ever were written.</q>—It is indeed a Queſtion with me, whether any Book of human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention is ſo difficult to underſtand, as the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, in many Parts: The Reaſon why is plain; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they treat of the moſt ſublime Truths; — Truths above the Comprehenſion of our Reaſon; and deal much in Parables, Metaphors and Figures of Speech: Beſides, the Stile and Manner of Expreſſion in thoſe Idioms or Languages in which they were originally delivered, is very different from ours at preſent: We are alſo very much unacquainted with the Scituation, Manners, Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, Habits, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> of the Countries and Nations of which they treat:— All which Things contribute to render many Parts of them abſtruſe, and hard to underſtand: And for theſe and other Reaſons, many who are either <hi>unlearned,</hi> or <hi>unſtable, wreſt them to their own Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> So that their being more difficult or hard to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:007862_0033_102DEA5E66D350D8"/>
than any other Book in general, is no Argument that the above Interpretation is wrong. — And to apply this Reaſon to the particular Caſe before us, it amounts to no more than this, That if the above Interpretation be allowed, this particular Sentence,—<hi>of that Day knows no Man,</hi> &amp;c, is hard to underſtand, when conſidered <hi>ſingly</hi> by itſelf, without any regard to the other Scriptures; for if we take, and impartially conſider, the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they evidently direct us to this Interpretation; as I have ſhewn to be the Caſe, notwithſtanding all your Author has yet offered to the contrary.—And is it a good or ſufficient Reaſon to reject an Interpretation grounded upon a Variety of plain Scriptures, merely becauſe the Text it ſelf, to which the Interpretation is applied, if conſidered <hi>ſingly</hi> by it ſelf, is hard to underſtand, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Interpretation? Surely it is not; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Prop of this <hi>ſecond</hi> Objection is weak and inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant: And not much unlike it is the <hi>third;</hi> which I proceed to conſider:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi>. <q>THE Interpretation muſt needs be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, which, if admitted, will make all, even the moſt plain Speech, <hi>uncertain,</hi> and utterly inſignificant; as this Interpretation of Chriſt's Words would do.</q> — In <hi>anſwer</hi> to this, it might be ſufficient to ſay, that like thoſe already conſidered, it's entirely founded on the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that the holy Scriptures afford no Grounds for ſuch an Interpretation (which yet remains to be proved) —For if Scripture explains it ſelf, there is certainly no juſt Cauſe to complain or object, that it is unintelligible: — Or if it interprets ſome particular Texts or Sentences, in a Manner different from the moſt common and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Uſe of Speech; it cannot therefore be juſtly objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that all Speech is hereby rendered uncertain and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly inſignificant.— This is to ſuppoſe that no Text or Sentence of Scripture whatever can poſſibly need any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining—That every Text in the Bible is to be literally
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:007862_0034_102DEA60C1CE8258"/>
underſtood in it's utmoſt Latitude, and ought not to have any limited or figurative Interpretation put upon it; but be underſtood preciſely according to it's Letters and Syllables: Which any one who has ever read the Bibles muſt ſee would make horrible Work indeed with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, fill it with the moſt palpable Falſehoods, and groſ, Contradictions;— In ſhort, it would render every figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Expreſſion, (in which the Scriptures abound) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely uſeleſs.—We muſt either underſtand them <hi>literally,</hi> or render them obnoxious to this Objection. — For every Interpretation that fixes a limited or figurative Senſe upon Scripture, muſt, at leaſt in Meaſure, have the ſame Tendency with this your Author objects againſt, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der plain Speech uncertain and unintelligible. I would inquire how we are to underſtand the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> when he calls the Lord his <hi>Rock?</hi>—The Prophet, when he affirms of the <hi>Jews</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>They have made their Faces harder than a Rock;</hi>
               </q>—And our Saviour, when he ſays, <q>
                  <hi>I am the Vine, ye are the Branches.—I am the Door.</hi>—This <hi>Bread is my Body:</hi> This <hi>Wine is my Blood, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q>? I am perſwaded your Author never thought that theſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions were to be <hi>literally</hi> underſtood; but explained them by his Senſes, Reaſon and other Parts of Scripture, which give them a <hi>figurative</hi> Interpretation, different from the <hi>literal</hi> and common Meaning of theſe very Words and Syllables:—And why may not we complain, that plain Speech is hereby rendered uncertain and utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant?—And ſtill further, if poſſible, to ſhew the Vanity of this Objection; and that your Author can with no Propriety urge it againſt the above Interpretation; I would obſerve, that he muſt continually ſwallow it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in its fulleſt Force, or renounce his own Opinion: For what will he tell us when we aſk the Apoſtle's Meaning where he declares Chriſt to be <hi>God bleſſed forevermore</hi>— the <hi>true God—God, whoſe Throne is eſtabliſhed forever,</hi> &amp;c.? Will he tell us, theſe Expreſſions are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:007862_0035_102DEA6278531910"/>
of his <hi>Office,</hi> and not of his <hi>Perſon?</hi> Aſtoniſhing! How uncertain and inſignificant then is the moſt plain and poſitive Speech!—I might alſo urge our Saviour's own Expreſſions, ſuch as, <hi>I and the Father are ONE; what Things ſoever the Father doth, thoſe alſo doth the Son likewiſe: He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father,</hi> &amp;c.—All which, and many more, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come conſiſtent with your Author's Opinion, muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo an Interpretation no leſs tending to render plain Speech uncertain and inſignificant, than this he objects to: So that when your Author inquires, in what Words Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt could in brief have denied himſelf to be God more plain and full than this or that, the ſame Method of Interpretation would not evade? The Queſtion may be returned, at leaſt with equal Force and Propriety,—In what Words could he or his Apoſtles have affirmed him to be <hi>truly God,</hi> more plain and full than they have done in a Variety of Inſtances, and which your Author's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation would not have evaded?—But I would not be thought by this to put the two Interpretations upon a level in point of Reaſon and Scripture-Evidence: That which your Author oppoſes has vaſtly the Advantage; not only for Reaſons I have already mentioned, but as having the general Current of Scripture in its Favour; vaſtly beyond what your Author's can pretend to, which ſeems principally to depend upon the ſingle Text now in debate.—And further, what I look upon much in Favour of the Interpretation I am pleading for is, that it's found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Expreſſions which either Chriſt himſelf uttered when profeſſedly and deſignedly diſcourſing of himſelf; or were uttered by the Apoſtles, when deſignedly ſpeaking of him and deſcribing of him to Mankind.—Whereas <hi>this</hi> Text, which your Author lays the greateſt Streſs upon, (and indeed many of the others) may be termed <hi>acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal</hi> (if any thing that came from the bleſſed Jeſus may be ſo termed) <hi>i. e.</hi> He was not profeſſedly and deſignedly
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:007862_0036_102DEA65150E84A8"/>
ſpeaking or diſcourſing of himſelf; <hi>he</hi> was not deſcribing himſelf, telling who and what he was, or the like; but engaged upon a different Subject; and theſe Words ſeem to be more properly an <hi>Epiſode,</hi> or <hi>Circumſtance,</hi> of the Diſcourſe, than a proper Part of the Diſcourſe itſelf: And this I humbly think, gives no ſmall Advantage to the Interpretation your Author oppoſes.—I ſhould have look'd upon the Words your Author builds his Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis upon, in a very different Light, and I am perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſome others would have urged them with greater Warmth and Reſolution, if poſſible, had they been a Part of a Diſcourſe wherein our Saviour himſelf, or his Apoſtles were deſignedly ſpeaking concerning him, or giving a Deſcription of him, to others who deſired or wanted In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.—But not to enlarge further here,—</p>
            <p>I proceed to,,</p>

               <hi>Object.</hi> 4. <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>THAT this Interpretation does plainly overthrow the Cauſe that is deſignedly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by it, and may be turned againſt it: For if it be juſt and true to deny of Chriſt abſolutely what belongs to him in <hi>one</hi> Nature, becauſe there is <hi>another</hi> Nature in which it belongs not to him; then, ſince to be the CHIEF GOD belongs to him (according to the above Method of Interpretation) only in <hi>one</hi> Nature, and not in reſpect of the <hi>other,</hi> or <hi>human</hi> Nature; it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that it may as juſtly be ſaid Jeſus Chriſt is not GOD, nor to be worſhipped or truſted as ſuch; nay, that he was not before the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi>—and the like; and this without adding any Limitation or Reſtriction, any more than our Lord does in the Place mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> THIS alſo is founded upon the old Suppoſition, That Scriptures afford no reaſonable Grounds for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Interpretation; nor deſcribe or repreſent our Lord Jeſus in any other Light than your Author does:—For if we are to believe our Lord Jeſus to be ſuch as the

               <hi>general Current</hi> of <hi>plain Scripture</hi> repreſents him to be; and this repreſents him to be GOD as well as <hi>Man;</hi> then the Objection ceaſes, and your Author's Concluſion is falſe:—But that we are to believe on, and ſpeak of, our Lord Jeſus as being ſuch as the general Current of plain Scripture repreſents him, cannot be denied by thoſe who hold the Scriptures to be a <hi>perfect Rule</hi> for our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice;</hi> and that the Scriptures repreſent our Lord Jeſus to be GOD as well as <hi>Man,</hi> has not yet been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed: And to urge the <hi>preſent Objection</hi> for this End, will appear unreaſonable, if we conſider more diſtinctly what every one muſt allow, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>, THAT our bleſſed Saviour was at Liberty, by his own Mouth, or that of his Apoſtles, to reveal Himſelf, the Deſign of his coming into the World, and the Nature of his Religion and Doctrine, in juſt what <hi>Form,</hi> and at what <hi>Time</hi> he pleaſed: And accordingly, while <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the Fleſh,</hi> He revealed <hi>theſe Things</hi> to his own Diſciples in a <hi>gradual Manner;</hi> and kept many Things, relating to the Nature and Deſign of his Kingdom, and Doctrine, <hi>ſecret,</hi> even from them, till after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and Aſcention: For it was the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> ſent by the Father, in his Name, that was to <hi>teach them all Things;</hi> and <hi>bring all Things to their Remembrance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, IT cannot be denied, That after our Saviour had fully revealed Himſelf, the Deſign of his Coming into World, the Nature of his Religion, <hi/> his Diſciples, and all who enjoyed this Revelation, were obliged to <hi>believe on Him,</hi> and <hi>ſpeak of Him,</hi> according to this <hi>whole</hi> Revelation taken together; <hi>one</hi> Part being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with and explained by <hi>another;</hi> and not according to <hi>particular</hi> Texts or Sentences, while the Revelation was in its <hi>Infancy</hi> or imperfect State.—And if this be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed (as I think it muſt be) then it follows, that it would be unreaſonable in <hi>us,</hi> who enjoy this <hi>whole</hi> Revelation, to believe or ſpeak of our bleſſed Saviour, and his Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,

the grand Subject of it, exactly according to <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> Sentences and Phraſes delivered while in its <hi>Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> and that are explained and interpreted by <hi>others</hi> of <hi>equal Authority: i. e.</hi> in ſhort, Since the Scriptures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent JESUS CHRIST to be GOD as well as <hi>Man,</hi> it would be abſurd and unreaſonable in us to ſpeak of HIM <hi>abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely,</hi> and without any <hi>Limitation</hi> or <hi>Reſerve,</hi> either as GOD or <hi>Man</hi>—We may conſiſtently and ſafely ſay, that JESUS CHRIST conſidered as <hi>Man,</hi> or with regard to his <hi>human</hi> Nature, is not GOD, nor to be worſhipped; that he was not <hi>before</hi> the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> &amp;c. But to ſpeak of him abſolutely and without any Limitation in <hi>this Form,</hi> would be abſurd; becauſe the <hi>Record</hi> God <hi>hath given of him,</hi> repreſents him to be <hi>truly</hi> GOD, attributes <hi>Worſhip</hi> to him, declares him to be <hi>eternal, &amp;c.</hi>—So ſhould any one preach that the <hi>human</hi> Nature of Chriſt was <hi>not</hi> GOD;—or ſhould one ſay, I believe that JESUS CHRIST conſidered <hi>as</hi> GOD, was <hi>not</hi> conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>nor</hi> born of the Virgin <hi>Mary, nor</hi> crucified under <hi>Pontius Pilate, nor</hi> dead nor buried, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this would be juſt; for his <hi>divine</hi> Nature, which the Scriptures affirm he had, was not capable of theſe Things:—But ſhould any one ſpeak thus of him in <hi>abſolute</hi> Terms, without any Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or Reſerve, he might juſtly be accuſed of Falſehood (if nothing worſe) becauſe <hi>the Scriptures</hi> repreſent JESUS CHRIST to be both GOD and <hi>Man;</hi> to be incapable of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering in his <hi>divine</hi> Nature, and to have actually ſuffered, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in his <hi>human.</hi>—And, (as has been obſerved) <hi>we</hi> are to conſider the Scriptures as one continued Diſcourſe or Record, which God hath given of his Son; of whom it is our Duty to believe and ſpeak (when we uſe <hi>abſolute</hi> Terms) according to the <hi>complex</hi> Deſcription or Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation here given of Him.—Your Author thinks it ſtrange if any Thing is to be believed relating to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Deity of Chriſt, that this is not taken Notice of in the <hi>Apoſtle's Creed,</hi> ſince this muſt be moſt important.

had as many Occaſions to ſubjoin a <hi>Caution</hi> to the one as to the other.—The moſt obvious Reaſon why they did not, in either of them, appears to me to be this;— That the Evangeliſts ſpake and wrote as they were inſpired or moved by the holy Ghoſt; who did not ſuggeſt to them the Neceſſity of ſuch a Caution.—The Evangeliſts (as I imagine) never thought, that the <hi>Pope's Chair</hi> would be founded on <hi>One;</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> on <hi>another;</hi> and the Doctrine of <hi>Arius</hi> on the <hi>third,</hi> of theſe Inſtances: — But infinite Wiſdom has ſeen fit (for wiſe and holy Ends no doubt) to permit them <hi>all;</hi>—Tho' I am far from thinking that the Want of ſuch Cautions, as your Author requires, will be any Excuſe either for <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> or <hi>Arians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS I have conſidered your Author's Hypotheſis, —the Scriptures upon which he grounds <hi>it,</hi>—and ſhewn how entirely it's overthrown by a fair and natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of other Scriptures; — That his <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections</hi> againſt this, are vain; ſuch as either have no Foundation at all, or may be retorted upon him in their full Force. His next Attempt is to ſhew, That there is no juſt Foundation in Scripture for this Interpretation; before which his Opinion muſt fall; that the Scriptures urg'd againſt him are capable of a different Turn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This therefore deſerves to be particularly conſidered; it being now the only Thing that can ſhelter the Opinion, I am oppoſing, from certain Ruin.—And upon an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Inquiry, I doubt not but this will alſo appear a Refuge of Lies.—</p>

            <p>HERE your Author propoſes, <hi>firſt;</hi> to <hi>Anſwer the Objections</hi> againſt his Hypotheſis; or <hi>refute the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,</hi> uſually brought from Scripture, to prove JESUS CHRIST to be <hi>really</hi> GOD, <hi>equal</hi> with the Father:—And he tells us, That becauſe <hi>Omniſcience</hi> is that infinite Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which is with the greateſt Shew of Reaſon, or plauſible Teſtimony alledged to belong to Chriſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he chooſes to ſingle out <hi>This</hi> in particular.— But I am much miſtaken, if he had not <hi>another</hi> and a <hi>truer</hi> Reaſon in his own Breaſt for this Conduct, <hi>viz.</hi> That his Reaſoning upon <hi>This</hi> Topic has a greater Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Truth, and is better adapted to deceive the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate and Unſtable, than it could be upon ſome <hi>others,</hi> which are alledged in Vindication of the ſupreme Deity of Jeſus Chriſt:— That this is actually the Caſe, I doubt not, will be made to appear hereafter. —</p>
            <p>I ſhall, in a few Words, expoſe the <hi>Fallacy</hi> of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning, upon the <hi>very Topic</hi> he has ſingled out; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>End</hi> he propoſed in chooſing <hi>This,</hi> rather than <hi>another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is alledged, in Vindication of the <hi>ſupreme Deity</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, That the Diſciples attribute to Him, infinite, unlimited Knowledge; John 16.30. <hi>Now are we ſure, that thou knoweſt all Things,</hi> &amp;c. And, Chap, 21. 17. <hi>Lord, Thou knoweſt all Things,</hi> &amp;c.—Now, infinite, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited Knowledge, is an incommunicable Perfection, and can belong only to the <hi>ſupreme</hi> God; and therefore, if the Diſciples Teſtimony be true, CHRIST is the <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme</hi> GOD; ſince they expreſly attribute ſuch Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to Him. — There is no Way to <hi>evade</hi> this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but by proving the Diſciples Teſtimony to be <hi>falſe;</hi> which is what your Author attempts. — He tells
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:007862_0042_102DEA736CCA8D80"/>
us, <q>Theſe Expreſſions are Words of Admiration from the Diſciples not yet inſpired; and are intended only to expreſs a very great and comprehenſive Knowledge, far from infinite, divine Omniſcience:</q>
            </p>
            <p>His Reaſons for this are,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>, <q>That Chriſt himſelf ſays, <hi>Of that Day and Hour knows not the Son.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS I have already ſhewn, is to be underſtood of his <hi>human Nature,</hi> and not of Him <hi>Perſonally</hi> conſidered; and that your Author's Objections againſt this Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation are groundleſs; ſo that it but poorly ſupplies the Place of an Argument here, to prove the Diſciples Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony <hi>falſe;</hi> or that they intended <hi>any Thing leſs</hi> by theſe Expreſſions than, <hi>infinite, divine Omniſcience.</hi>— And,</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>. I MUST confeſs my Inability, to ſee the leaſt Force in Argument <hi>ſecond.</hi>— What! Does it follow that theſe Expreſſions of the Diſciples are to be underſtood with a <hi>Limitation,</hi> as intending no more than a great or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Degree of Knowledge; becauſe the Woman of <hi>Tekoah</hi> told King <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 14.20, that <hi>He was wiſe according to the Wiſdom of an Angel to know all Things on Earth?</hi>—Or does the Expreſſion of St. <hi>John,</hi> 1 John 2.20, <hi>Ye know all Things</hi> (which he expreſsly limits to the Matters or Truths concerning which he was writing,) does this prove, that the Diſciples are to be underſtood in a <hi>confined</hi> or <hi>limited Senſe;</hi> when without any <hi>Limitation</hi> or <hi>Reſerve,</hi> they attribute the <hi>Knowledge of all Things</hi> to Chriſt?— Or, Is the high Opinion the <hi>Jews</hi> had of their Prophets, an Argument that we ſhould have a lower Opinion of our bleſſed Saviour? Or, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they aſſigned an <hi>almoſt</hi> univerſal Knowledge to <hi>them,</hi> muſt we aſſign a <hi>limited</hi> Knowſedge to <hi>Him?</hi>— The moſt that can be infer'd from theſe Paſſages is, That under certain Circumſtances, the Diſciples might poſſibly expreſs themſelves pretty much in <hi>this</hi> Manner; and yet intend no more by it, than a <hi>very great</hi> and <hi>compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:007862_0043_102DEA751FDFBE88"/>
Knowledge; becauſe there are Examples in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Expreſſions, <hi>ſomewhat ſimilar,</hi> which did not intend <hi>infinite, divine</hi> Omniſcience: I ſay, <hi>ſomewhat ſimilar;</hi> becauſe I challenge a ſingle Inſtance to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from Scripture, where an Expreſſion of the like Nature was uttered with that Air of <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> which is manifeſt in this of the Diſciples; <hi>Now we are ſure,</hi> &amp;c. Or, where the Expreſſion it ſelf, or what immediately preceeds or follows, does not plainly confine it to certain Bounds; or ſhew that it's to be underſtood in a <hi>limited</hi> Senſe.— But this is not the Caſe here: The Expreſſion is uttered with an Air of <hi>Aſſurance:</hi> The Terms are <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>explicite;</hi> and neither what preceeds or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows ſo much as intimates, that they are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, or were intended, with any <hi>Limitation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For,</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, IT'S to the laſt Degree abſurd, to conclude, that the Diſciples did not intend <hi>infinite, divine Omniſcience;</hi> becauſe they infer from our Saviour's Knowledge, that <hi>He came forth from God.</hi>—This is the <hi>very Thing</hi> I would infer from it, — That HE proceeded from the Father; and <hi>Equally</hi> partakes of the <hi>Divine Eſſence,</hi> and <hi>all poſſible Perfections:</hi>— Or, If we underſtand his <hi>coming forth from the Father,</hi> of his Miſſion into the World; the inferring this from his Knowledge, is no Argument that the Diſciples did not look upon Him to be <hi>Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> and intentionally attribute this Perfection to Him.— But I am much miſtaken, if the Diſciples were not thoroughly convinced and aſſured of his <hi>divine Miſſion</hi> long before this; and therefore think it moſt probable, that by <hi>coming forth from God,</hi> they intended his <hi>ſupreme</hi> Deity, and <hi>Equallity</hi> with the Father; which they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd from his <hi>infinite</hi> Knowledge.—They <hi>ſurely</hi> believed Him to be at leaſt, <hi>a Prophet ſent of God,</hi> long before this: His Miracles were a moſt convincing Proof of this: Even ſome of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> declared, that <hi>no Man could
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:007862_0044_102DEA77F18BF1D8"/>
do ſuch Miracles, except God was with Him.</hi>— But here the Diſciples are convinced of ſomething <hi>New:— Now we are</hi> ſure <hi>that thou knoweſt all Things;</hi> and hence, <hi>We believe that thou cameſt forth from God:</hi> i. e. That <hi>Thou art a divine Perſon;</hi> a Partaker of the <hi>divine Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,</hi> and <hi>all divine Perfections.</hi> — Beſides, Had the Diſciples aſcribed <hi>that,</hi> in ſuch <hi>ſtrong</hi> and <hi>explicit</hi> Terms, to our bleſſed Saviour, which belonged <hi>not</hi> to Him, is it not ſtrange that he gives them no Reproof or Caution? Was He ſuch a Lover of <hi>hyperbolical Encomiums</hi> and <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Adulations,</hi> as to allow his own Diſciples, without the <hi>leaſt Rebuke,</hi> to attribute <hi>that</hi> to Him, a <hi>Creature,</hi> which belongs <hi>only</hi> to the <hi>Creator?</hi> I add, That if our Saviour had not <hi>infinite, divine</hi> Omniſcience, or ſuch a Knowledge as belongs <hi>only</hi> to GOD <hi>ſupreme;</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Argument, That He <hi>knew</hi> his <hi>Love</hi> to Him, is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.—For, from what, ſhort of an <hi>unlimited</hi> Knowledge of <hi>the Hearts of all Men,</hi> could he infer his Knowledge of <hi>his Heart,</hi> or <hi>Love</hi> to Him? St. <hi>Peter</hi> muſt have argued very fooliſhly, as well as falſely, to have infer'd, That Chriſt <hi>knew his Heart;</hi> or, (which is the ſame,) his <hi>Love to Him,</hi> merely becauſe he <hi>knew many Things;</hi> or had a great and comprehenſive Knowledge; or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any Knowledge ſhort of <hi>infinite, divine</hi> Omniſcience; or that <hi>of the Hearts of all Men,</hi> which belongs <hi>only</hi> to GOD <hi>ſupreme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT that our Lord Jeſus had <hi>infinite, divine Omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> and the <hi>Knowledge of Men's Hearts</hi> in particular, appears not only from <hi>theſe</hi> and other Expreſſions of the like Nature;—But</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> FROM his own Words, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.23: Where he claims it as his ſole Prerogative to <hi>ſearch the Reins and the Hearts;</hi> and, <hi>all the Churches ſhall know, that I am</hi> HE <hi>which ſearch the Reins and the Hearts:</hi>—Now <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> declares, 1 Kings 8.39, <hi>Thou</hi> (i. e. God) <hi>even thou</hi> only, <hi>knoweſt the Hearts of all the Children of Men;</hi> and
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:007862_0045_102DEA799E8147C8"/>
               <hi>Jerem.</hi> 17.10, God declares by the Prophet, <hi>I the Lord ſearch the Heart; I try the Reins,</hi> &amp;c. Here the great God is, as plainly as Words can expreſs, diſtinguiſhed from all others, by his <hi>knowing and ſearching the Hearts and trying the Reins</hi> of all <hi>Men.</hi>—It belongs to Him <hi>only,</hi> to <hi>ſearch the Hearts;</hi> and <hi>to give to every Man according to his Ways, and the Fruit of his Doings.</hi>—And therefore, ſince our Lord Jeſus declares himſelf to be, <hi>HE who ſearcheth the Reins and the Hearts, and gives to every one according to their Works,</hi> HE muſt be the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>ſupreme</hi> GOD:—He expreſsly claims <hi>that</hi> as his ſole Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, by which the great God is diſtinguiſhed from all others.—He does not ſay, the Churches <hi>ſhall know</hi> that I ſearch the Reins and the Hearts; but, that <hi>I am</hi> HE;—Which, if Words have any Force in them; yea, if the Expreſſion is not altogether unintelligible, implies, <hi>I am HE</hi> who is diſtinguiſhed by this Character; or the Churches <hi>ſhall know</hi> that <hi>I am THE GOD,</hi> who <hi>ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Reins and the Hearts, to give to every one accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET us now inquire what your Author has ſaid to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>validate this, which he promiſes a ſerious Conſideration; and, with an Air of Seriouſneſs, inſinuates that, <q>'Tis no wonder that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſhould not know of any other to whom that Excellency, <hi>viz.</hi> the Knowledge of the Hearts of all Men, was communicated, than God only.</q>
If I underſtand him, he means that it's no wonder if <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> was ignorant that this Excellency was, or could be communicated from God to any one:—If ſo, this is a Point I ſhall not even attempt to diſpute; it being the very Thing I would infer from the Words of <hi>Solomon,</hi> that he thought the Knowledge of the Hearts of all Men <hi>peculiar to God;</hi> that He <hi>only,</hi> has an underived, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent and unlimited Knowledge of the Hearts of Men; which is an incommunicable Perfection or Excellency; a diſtinguiſhing Character of the <hi>ſupreme</hi> God; tho' in ſome
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:007862_0046_102DEA7C52B38D48"/>
low Degree and at ſome particular Times, one Man may have the Knowledge of another's Heart by Revelation from God; <hi>i. e.</hi> in ſhort, God may reveal to his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Things which they could not know or diſcover by any other Means: But does it hence follow, that Chriſt's Knowledge of Men's Hearts is communicated to Him? or, that it's derived from and dependent upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one? Does it follow by any Rules of Reaſoning, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting thoſe your Author hath invented, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Knowledge of the Hearts of Men was derived from <hi>another,</hi> becauſe that of the Prophets and Apoſtles was; who at certain Times and in ſome Degree had this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge? Surely no; an Appeal to the Reaſon and ſober Thought of every Perſon is a ſufficient Anſwer to ſuch forced and unnatural Concluſions.—But,</p>
            <p>
               <q>DOES not Chriſt himſelf own, that he knew what he reveals in the ſeven Epiſtles to the ſeven Churches by Revelation from God? <hi>It was the Revelation which God gave to Jeſus Christ,</hi>&amp;c.</q>—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer;</hi> To give this any Weight at preſent, the Truth and Juſtneſs of your Author's Objections, in Chap. 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>, muſt be granted; but the Vanity of theſe hath been already ſhewn, and therefore the Method of Interpretation I have maintained againſt them, is a plain and natural So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this, <hi>viz.</hi> That God gave this Revelation to Chriſt, as <hi>Man,</hi> or as our <hi>Mediator,</hi> and therewith a Commiſſion to <hi>ſhew it to his Servants;</hi> ſo that this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation's being given to him in this Character, is no Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt his <hi>Divinity,</hi> or his infinite, divine Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience.</p>
            <p>IT would be trifling to take Notice of his quibbling An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to thoſe who ſay, that Chriſt's ſearching the Heart imports it to be his <hi>own Act.</hi>—</p>
            <p>He argues <hi>Secondly,</hi> 
               <q>THAT there is no Abſurdity in attributing this Knowledge of the Heart to Jeſus Chriſt, tho' he be <hi>not</hi> the moſt high GOD. That he knows
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:007862_0047_102DEA7F1BF9B288"/>
Things with ſome <hi>Limitation</hi> as to the Degree, and in Dependence on his Father as to the Manner, he thinks appears from what he has already ſaid; and therefore concludes that the Knowledge of the Heart attributed to him, muſt be ſuch as is conſiſtent with his <hi>ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> to the Father's <hi>greater</hi> Knowledge.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT as I have already ſhewn, that thoſe Texts from which Chriſt's <hi>inferiority</hi> or <hi>ſubordination</hi> to the Father has been argued, are to be underſtood of his <hi>human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> or of him as <hi>Mediator,</hi> and not of him <hi>Perſonally;</hi> and removed the Objections againſt this Interpretation; ſo the Concluſion your Author makes is invalid: There is no Neceſſity, nor any ſufficient Reaſon yet produced, that the Knowledge of Chriſt muſt be ſuch as is conſiſtent with any <hi>ſubordination</hi> to the Father's Knowledge.</p>
            <p>IT has not yet been ſhewn, that the Father has greater Knowledge than He; and therefore it can with no Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety be concluded, that his Knowledge muſt be <hi>ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> to the Father's: This is begging the Queſtion.</p>
            <p>AND now, ſhould the Point be granted, which your Author labours ſo long upon, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be demonſtrated, that it exceeds a <hi>finite Capacity</hi> to know the Concerns of all on this Earth, when the enlarged Underſtanding is aſſiſted in the higheſt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by <hi>divine</hi> Influence and Revelation.</q>—Yet this can no Ways militate againſt the infinite, divine Omniſcience of Jeſus Chriſt: At leaſt, it will be as difficult to ſhow, that whatever cannot be demonſtrated to be abſurd or impoſſible is true of Him, as that a finite Being cannot poſſibly know all the Concerns of this Earth.</p>
            <p>YOUR Author's Argument ſtands thus:—"It cannot be demonſtrated impoſſible, that a <hi>finite</hi> Being ſhould by any Means know the Concerns of all on this Earth; and therefore tho' Chriſt knows the Concerns of all on this Earth, yet he is a <hi>finite</hi> Being, and has not infinite, divine Omniſcience."—This is plainly your Author's Senſe; thô
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:007862_0048_102DEA80D348CC50"/>
not exactly his Words; or elſe I can't ſee to what Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he aſſerts, that it cannot be demonſtrated impoſſible for a finite Being to know the Concerns of all on this Earth.—But there needs no Words to ſhew his Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be <hi>arbitrary</hi> and <hi>groundleſs</hi> thus far.— And ſhould it be further granted, that Chriſt as <hi>Mediator,</hi> or <hi>Man,</hi> knows, from Time to Time, the various Miſeries, Caſes and Neceſſities of his Servants; which is the moſt that your Author pretends to; yet it does not follow, that he is not Omniſcient; or that he did not intend to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Himſelf as the OMNISCIENT GOD, when he ſays, <hi>All the Churches ſhall know,</hi> that I <hi>am He which ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Reins and the Hearts.</hi>—Thô I think it highly neceſſary, that the Judge of Men and Angels ſhould be <hi>Omniſcient;</hi> and therefore that none is qualified for <hi>this,</hi> but the MOST HIGH GOD; who is declared to be <hi>Judge himſelf,</hi> Pſal. 50.6, compared with Heb. 12.23.— Yet to ſhorten the Work, and refute your Author's Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning in his own Way, I give him the Point he contends for, <hi>viz.</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt, as <hi>Man,</hi> may from Time to Time be acquainted with the Wants and Miſeries of his Servants; yet I argue, that he intended to repreſent Himſelf as the <hi>Omniſcient God,</hi> from the Manner of the Expreſſion; and indeed the whole Force of the Argument lies in this: For if it be demonſtrated abſolutely neceſſary, that our <hi>Mediator</hi> and <hi>Judge,</hi> ſhould be the <hi>omniſcient God</hi> any other Way, there would be no need of this, or any other Text, to prove it:—Your Author therefore evidently flies from the Queſtion, and quits himſelf of the Argument which he pretends to Anſwer.—Inſtead of ſhewing, that our Saviour does not repreſent himſelf to be <hi>Omniſcient;</hi> he challenges a Demonſtration, that it's abſolutely neceſſary that he ſhould be, and utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that he ſhould know the Miſeries and Wants of his Servants without this: <hi>i. e.</hi> in ſhort, he requires ſome other Proof or Demonſtration of Chriſt's <hi>Omniſcience,</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:007862_0049_102DEA8304A0AD58"/>
before he admits his own Words as a Proof of it:—A Method of Reaſoning I muſt confeſs entirely new to me, till I read your Author!—I always thought that <hi>one,</hi> or at leaſt <hi>two unanſwerable Arguments</hi> were ſufficient to prove any Point, whether Civil or Theological:—And upon this Footing our Saviour's <hi>Omniſcience</hi> is clear and undeniable: For (as I have already ſhewn) his Diſciples aſcribed <hi>infinite, unlimited Knowledge</hi> to Him:—And here He himſelf claims a diſtinguiſhing, Character of <hi>Almighty GOD;</hi> that by which his <hi>infinite, divine Omniſcience</hi> is frequently repreſented; <hi>Thou, even thou only knoweſt the Hearts of all the Children of Men—I the Lord ſearch the Heart; I try the Reins, even to give every Man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Ways, and the Fruit of his Doings:</hi> — And, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord God, Behold I, even I will both ſearch my Sheep, and ſeek them out.</hi>—Theſe are Expreſſions by which GOD Almighty duſtinguiſhes Himſelf; the Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of his <hi>Omniſcience,</hi> by which his univerſal, underived and independent <hi>Knowledge of the Hearts of Men,</hi> is moſt emphatically repreſented:—This is one of the Characters by which he is known: See Pſal. 7.9, <hi>For the righteous God trieth the Heart and Reins,</hi> &amp;c. — Jer. 11.20, <hi>But O Lord of Hoſts, that judgeſt righteouſly, that trieſt the Reins and the Heart,</hi> &amp;c.—and many other Texts to the ſame Purpoſe might be produced, were it neceſſary, where GOD Almighty is expreſsly diſtinguiſhed and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterized by his <hi>ſearching, trying, and knowing the Reins and Hearts:</hi>—The Concluſion therefore is plain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable, that CHRIST is the <hi>Almighty, Omniſcient GOD;</hi> ſince he expreſsly declares himſelf to be, <hi>HE which ſearcheth the Reins and the Hearts, to give to every one according to their Works:</hi> — Nor does any Thing your Author has ſaid, in the leaſt militate againſt this Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but granting all he contends for, <hi>it</hi> remains good, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That <hi>Solomon</hi> did not know of any other to whom this Excellency was communicated—That it cannot

be demonſtrated abſurd and impoſſible, that a finite Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity ſhould know the Concerns of all on this Earth, &amp;c.—And, that Jeſus Chriſt, as Man, may by the Aſſiſtance of God, know from Time to Time the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and Wants of his Servants.</q> — Tho' all this be granted as true; yet it no Ways militates againſt the Truth of the Concluſion, that CHRIST is the <hi>omniſcient GOD:</hi>—Which does not depend upon a Demonſtration that theſe Things are <hi>falſe,</hi> as your Author inſinuates;— for theſe may all be true, and yet the Premiſes from which I draw my Concluſion be ſtrictly true likewiſe: — Thus, GOD Almighty is frequently characterized and diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Scripture by his <hi>ſearching, trying and knowing the Hearts and Reins of Men.</hi>—But JESUS CHRIST is thus characterized and diſtinguiſhed; nay, what is more, he expreſsly aſſerts Himſelf, without any <hi>Limitation,</hi> and in the ſtrongeſt Terms, to be <hi>HE which ſearcheth the Reins and the Hearts;</hi> — therefore He muſt be the Almighty GOD. Now which of theſe Propoſitions do the Points your Author contends for, militate againſt? — Does it follow, that GOD Almighty is not thus characterized and diſtinguiſhed, becauſe <hi>Solomon</hi> thought that He, and He only, was? Or, becauſe its not demonſtrably abſurd and impoſſible that a <hi>finite</hi> Capacity ſhould, by the Aſſiſtance of God, know the Concerns of all on this Earth? Or, that Jeſus Chriſt, as Man, ſhould by this Means know the Miſeries and Wants of his Servants? Surely no: For if GOD is any where emphatically and plainly diſtinguiſhed and characterized in Scripture, it is by his <hi>ſearching, try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and knowing the Hearts of Men:</hi>—I challenge an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to the contrary of this;—or where GOD Almighty is more plainly and emphatically diſtinguiſhed from <hi>all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,</hi> by any <hi>Character</hi> whatever, than He is by <hi>this</hi> of <hi>ſearching, trying and knowing Men's Hearts;</hi> and if ſo, then allowing your Author's Reaſoning juſt. He is no where diſtinguiſhed by any Perfection or Excellency; nor
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:007862_0051_102DEA878338EF98"/>
is there any Thing by which we can know him from ſome of his Creatures. If the ſame Expreſſions which are brôt to diſtinguiſh and characterize the great GOD, are appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to his Creatures, they do not diſtinguiſh him at all: Thus; e. g. to ſay that if <hi>ſearching the Heart,</hi> &amp;c. when applied immediately to God, means, that <hi>none knows the Heart as God does,</hi> ſo univerſally, ſo immediately and independently, (as your Author owns;) and yet <hi>that,</hi> when applied to Chriſt in the <hi>very ſame Words,</hi> it means no more than that he has a derived, limited Power of <hi>ſearching the Hearts,</hi> is very abſurd: 'Tis as much as to ſay, The very ſame Expreſſions which denote the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, immediate and independent Knowledge of the <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme</hi> GOD, and diſtinguiſh Him from all created Beings; denote no more than the limited, derived and dependent Knowledge of CHRIST; and diſtinguiſh him only from ſome ignorant, ſhort-ſighted Mortals.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, <hi>Secondly,</hi> It cannot be alledged, that any Thing your Author has ſaid, militates againſt the <hi>ſecond</hi> of the Propoſitions, from which the Concluſion is deduced, that CHRIST is GOD <hi>omniſcient, viz.</hi> That HE is characterized and diſtinguiſhed in the ſame Manner that the <hi>ſupreme</hi> GOD is, by <hi>ſearching the Reins and the Hearts, to give to every one according to their Works:</hi> This is a <hi>plain Fact,</hi> which admits of no Diſpute, That Jeſus Chriſt actually in the <hi>ſtrongest Terms,</hi> and <hi>moſt explicit Manner,</hi> declares him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be HE <hi>which ſearcheth the Reins and the Hearts.</hi>— And therefore it follows, that CHRIST himſelf is the <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, omniſcient</hi> GOD, who <hi>only knows the Hearts of the Children of Men;</hi> and who is <hi>diſtinguiſhed from all others,</hi> by <hi>ſearching and trying the Reins and the Hearts.</hi>—I add, That the Expreſſion <hi>I am He,</hi> as it is here ſpoken of CHRIST, ſeems to be peculiarly appropriated to the <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme</hi> GOD in Scripture: Thus, Iſaiah 41.4. <hi>I the Lord, the first, and with the last, I am He; Chap.</hi> 46.4. <hi>I am He, &amp;c.</hi> 51.12. <hi>I, even I, am He that comforteth you.</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:007862_0052_102DEA8A0A90BE10"/>
The great GOD here diſtinguiſhes himſelf from all others, by ſaying <hi>I am He;</hi> this evidently denotes his great Power, Might and Supremacy: And this Expreſſion, if I miſtake not, is no where in Scripture uſed in the ſame Manner by any but God Himſelf. Our Saviour's uſing it in this Manner is therefore a probable Argument that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to repreſent <hi>Himſelf</hi> as the <hi>ſupreme</hi> GOD; and to diſtinguiſh <hi>Himſelf</hi> from all, that by Revelation, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived Power obtain a <hi>Knowledge of the Hearts of Men;</hi> as God diſtinguiſhes <hi>Himſelf</hi> from all <hi>ſubordinate Comforters,</hi> when he ſays, <hi>I am He which comforteth you.</hi>—But what confirms it, that our Saviour intends here to repreſent <hi>Himſelf</hi> as the <hi>ſupreme, omniſcient</hi> GOD, is his expreſsly claiming another <hi>distinguiſhing Character</hi> of God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in the proceeding Chapter, Ver. 8 and 11.—See, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.6. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, the King of Iſrael, and his Redeemer, the Lord of Hoſts, I am the Firſt, and I am the Laſt;</hi>— And, <hi>Chap.</hi> 41.4.48.12. In all which Places, the <hi>ſupreme</hi> GOD diſtinguiſhes and characterizes Himſelf in <hi>this</hi> Manner, I AM THE FIRST AND THE LAST. And in the <hi>ſame</hi> Manner our Saviour diſtingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes and characterizes Himſelf.—<hi>I am</hi> Alpha <hi>and</hi> Omega, <hi>the Beginning and the Ending, ſaith the Lord; which is, and which was, and which is to come, the</hi> Almighty.— I AM — THE FIRST AND THE LAST. — And what can be the Import of theſe Expreſſions, but that HE is the Eternal, Self-Exiſtent, Almighty GOD? — Or, What could our Saviour intend to repreſent Himſelf to be, unleſs what the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> declares of Him, (no doubt by divine Inſpiration,) that He is, <hi>Wonderful, — Councellor, — the</hi> MIGHTY GOD, — <hi>the everlaſting Father,— the Prince of Peace,</hi> Chap. 9.6. Or could He in any ſtronger or more emphatical Terms, have declared Himſelf to be, in the moſt eminent Senſe, <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, Immortal</hi> and <hi>Omnipotent?</hi> — Beſides <hi>creating Power,</hi> which neceſſarily implies <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> is expreſly
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:007862_0053_102DEA8BABB8CB78"/>
attributed to Him; Joh. 1.3, <hi>All Things were made by Him; and without Him was not any Thing made that was made.</hi> Heb. 1.10, 11, 12, <hi>And, Thou Lord, in the Beginning haſt laid the Foundation of the Earth, and the Heavens are the Works of thine Hands,</hi> &amp;c.—And ſince theſe <hi>other distinguiſhing Characters</hi> of the <hi>ſupreme</hi> GOD, are expreſsly claimed by, and attributed to our Lord Jeſus, there is no Room to doubt, but that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to repreſent Himſelf as the <hi>omniſcient</hi> GOD, by ſaying, <hi>All the Churches ſhall know, that I am HE which ſearcheth the Reins and the Hearts:</hi> And conſidering how plainly, frequently and emphatically theſe <hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> Characters of the <hi>ſupreme</hi> GOD are claimed by and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to CHRIST; it is abſurd and arbitrary to require Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments for his <hi>ſupreme</hi> DEITY from any other Topics than theſe, which as plainly aſſert and prove it, as Words can do.—Thus it appears that this Argument for the <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme</hi> DEITY of CHRIST, remains good notwithſtanding all your Author's Labour to refute and overthrow it: And indeed all that he himſelf pretends to, is, to have ſhewn it poſſible for Chriſt, by Revelation from God, to know the Miſeries and Wants of his Servants, tho' himſelf be not God; which is far from ſhewing that Chriſt is not God, or that he did not intend to repreſent himſelf as God; and no ways affects or weakens the Arguments I have uſed to ſhow that he intentionedly claims a <hi>diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Character</hi> of the <hi>ſupreme</hi> GOD.—To conclude this Head; ſhould any one be diſpoſed to make the Trial, and apply our Author's reaſoning againſt the <hi>Omniſcience</hi> of CHRIST, againſt his <hi>eternal Existence,</hi> or <hi>almighty creating Power,</hi> as aſſerted in Scripture; I am much miſtaken if they would not have the Mortification to be diſappointed, and find themſelves unable to dreſs <hi>Falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> with ſo great an Appearance of <hi>Truth;</hi> as your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor has done upon <hi>this</hi> Topic: And this will eaſily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for his prefering <hi>this</hi> to <hi>any other;</hi> and likewiſe
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:007862_0054_102DEA8DC0A0C440"/>
prove him miſtaken when he inſinuates, that the ſame Reaſoning he has uſed here will hold equally true when applied to any other divine Perfection attributed to Chriſt: If he means thus, there is as good a Foundation for this way of Reaſoning againſt any other Perfection as that of <hi>Omniſcience,</hi> I readily join with Him: But if he intends by it, that the ſame Way of Reaſoning (or indeed any other) would have the like ſemblance of Truth, when applied to thoſe <hi>other Perfections</hi> I have mentioned, as when applied to <hi>this</hi> of <hi>Omniſcience,</hi> it is what I very much ſcruple:—It muſt be confeſſed, his Reaſoning here has a very ſpecious Appearance of Truth; and may over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet the Ignorant and Unſtable; for which Reaſon I have dwelt the longer upon it; and more diſtinctly and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly expoſed its <hi>Fallacy,</hi> than I ſhould otherwiſe have done; and more largely vindicated <hi>this Point</hi> of Chriſt's <hi>Omniſcience;</hi> becauſe ſome of my Reaſoning in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Part of this Letter is grounded upon it; and as I have maintained this, ſo whatever depends upon the Truth of it, remains good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> I proceed to argue the <hi>ſupreme Deity</hi> of JESUS CHRIST from that <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Homage</hi> we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to pay Him; and conſider your Author's Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt it.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>ſupreme Deity</hi> of CHRIST is argued from the <hi>Worſhip and Homage</hi> we are commanded to pay to him. —Thus, the <hi>ſupreme GOD only</hi> is the proper Object of the religious Worſhip and Homage of his Creatures, <hi>Math.</hi> 4.10. <hi>It is written, Thou ſhalt worſhip the Lord thy God; and him only ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> The Diſciples of our Saviour, yea Angels have refuſed to receive Homage from Men, they being all equally Servants to their common Creator:—And indeed, Reaſon teaches us, that all our religious Homage and Praiſe, ſhould be <hi>ultimately</hi> to the <hi>ſupreme GOD</hi>—That whatever Homage we pay to any
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:007862_0055_102DEA8FF1214158"/>
created Being, it ſhould be <hi>ſubordinate</hi> to that which we pay to GOD, who is the Fountain of all Being; and from whom Men and Angels derive all their Happineſs.— "This is a Point never diſputed, that I know of, by <hi>Arian</hi> or <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctors." And now that <hi>religious Worſhip</hi> is to be paid to Chriſt, as the <hi>ultimate Object</hi> of it, appears,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. FROM <hi>John</hi> 5.23. That <hi>All Men ſhould honour the Son, even as they honour the Father:</hi>—That is, ſays your Author, <q>as <hi>truely,</hi> not as <hi>greatly; becauſe the Father hath committed or given all Judgment to him.</hi>
               </q>
If I underſtand him here, he ſuppoſes that Chriſt's having <hi>all Judgment committed to him,</hi> is the ſole Ground and Foundation of <hi>that Honour</hi> which we are commanded to pay to him; and therefore, that <hi>this Honour</hi> muſt be <hi>inferiour</hi> to <hi>that</hi> which we owe the Father: Or, that tho' we are <hi>truely</hi> to honour Chriſt, yet we are not to honour him <hi>as</hi> we honour the Father, or with the <hi>ſame Honour:</hi>—But this Concluſion is entirely overthrown by what follows in the very ſame Verſe— <hi>He that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father:</hi> —But if the Son's having <hi>all Judgment committed to him,</hi> is the ſole Ground of his claiming Honour and Homage from us, it will be difficult to ſhow how and why <hi>his</hi> Honour is ſo inſeparably connected with the <hi>Father</hi>'s.— If it be ſaid, that he who neglects to honour the King's Officer or Ambaſſador, neglects to honour the King him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.—I anſwer, that tho' ſuch an one would neglect to honour the King in this particular Inſtance; yet he might honour him in other Inſtances; he might reſpect and honour his Perſon and Government in general, tho' he neglected to honour even the higheſt Officer in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: But here it is indefinitely declared, that <hi>he that honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father;</hi> i. e. He does not duly honour or glorify the Father, who refuſes to honour and glorify the Son, as he does the Father.—
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:007862_0056_102DEA928951BE00"/>
Honour muſt therefore be due to the Son upon <hi>ſome other Grounds,</hi> than <hi>that</hi> of his having <hi>all Judgment committed to him;</hi> even becauſe he is <hi>true God, equal with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> and therefore as <hi>great</hi> and <hi>true Honour</hi> is due to <hi>Him</hi> as to the <hi>Father;</hi> as <hi>great</hi> Faith, Love, Fear, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Obedience is due to the <hi>Son</hi> as to the <hi>Father.</hi>— It's abſurd to ſuppoſe, that the Honour of Almighty GOD, as due from us, is inſeparably connected with the Honour of any <hi>mere Creature;</hi> and therefore ſince <hi>His</hi> Honour is thus connected with the Honour of Chriſt, to ſuppoſe Chriſt a <hi>mere Creature,</hi> is abſurd. Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>. THAT the <hi>ſame</hi> Honour, Homage or Worſhip, is due to the Father and Son, and upon the <hi>ſame Grounds,</hi> appears from Matth. 28.19. <hi>Go ye therefore, and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the</hi> FATHER, <hi>and of the</hi> SON, <hi>and of the</hi> HOLY GHOST.—Now, that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is an <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>religious Worſhip,</hi> can admit of no reaſonable Diſpute: It is repreſented in the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as an <hi>eſſential Branch</hi> of Chriſtianity: It was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly <hi>required</hi> of all who came into the Church, or made a Profeſſion of Chriſt's Religion in the Apoſtle's Time: And our Saviour himſelf makes it <hi>ordinarily neceſſary</hi> to Salvation under the Goſpel, Mark 16.16.—Moreover, if we conſider the <hi>Thing ſignifyed,</hi> or <hi>repreſented</hi> by this Sacrament; — the <hi>Temper</hi> with which it ſhould be received; whether perſonally or for others; and the <hi>End</hi> that ſhould be aimed at, and anſwered by it; it muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be a moſt important and ſolemn Act of <hi>religious Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Homage:</hi>—And that it is ſo, as <hi>properly</hi> and <hi>immediately,</hi> with reſpect to the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> as it is with reſpect to the <hi>Father,</hi> admits of no Controverſy. We are as <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>properly</hi> baptized in the Name of the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> as of the <hi>Father;</hi> and therefore this is an <hi>Act of Worſhip</hi> paid as immediately and as properly to the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as to the <hi>Father:</hi>—But, ſays your Author, <q>We are baptized in the Name of the <hi>Son,</hi>
                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:007862_0057_102DEA944BCEB480"/>
becauſe, <hi>All Power in Heaven and Earth was given to Him:</hi>
               </q> Which he gathers from the preceeding Verſe, —<hi>All Power is given unto me in Heaven and Earth,</hi>— therefore, <hi>go and baptize,</hi> &amp;c. Now it is plain, beyond all Contradiction, that if Chriſt's having <hi>all Power given him,</hi> is aſſerted here as the <hi>only</hi> proper Grounds of our being baptized in <hi>his Name;</hi> the <hi>very ſame</hi> is the Grounds of our being baptized in the <hi>Father's Name;</hi> for the <hi>ſame Reaſon</hi> (if any at all) is aſſigned for the <hi>one</hi> as the <hi>other:</hi> And we may with the <hi>ſame Propriety</hi> infer, that we are baptized in the <hi>Father's</hi> Name, becauſe all Power is given to the <hi>Son,</hi> as that we are baptized in the <hi>Son</hi>'s Name for <hi>this</hi> Reaſon; and therefore, it cannot be hence inferred that <hi>this</hi> is the proper and only Ground of our being baptized in the <hi>Name of the Son:</hi> — It is plain, that Chriſt's <hi>having all Power given him,</hi> is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned here only as the Ground of his ſending or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioning his Diſciples (as the <hi>Mediator</hi> between GOD and <hi>Man,</hi>) to <hi>teach and baptize all Nations;</hi> and not as the Reaſon of their being <hi>baptized in the Name of the Son.</hi> And thus it renewedly appears, that we are commanded to pay <hi>religious Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Homage</hi> to CHRIST, as the proper and ultimate Object of it: And that, as eaſy as your Author inſinuates it to be, he has not ſhewn nor offered any Thing of Reaſon to the contrary. I might produce other Inſtances to the ſame Purpoſe, were it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,—As <hi>Philippians</hi> 2.10. <hi>Hebrews</hi> 1.6. Where, <hi>All the Angels of God</hi> are commanded <hi>to worſhip</hi> HIM.— But it will ſufficiently confirm what has been ſaid (if there be need of further Teſtimony) to produce Inſtances from Scripture, where <hi>religious Worſhip</hi> is evidently given to CHRIST, as the proper and ultimate Object of it.</p>
            <p>I FORBEAR mentioning the many Inſtances of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Worſhip from his own Diſciples and others, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Crucifixion and Aſcention; becauſe it may be ſaid, perhaps, that this was not <hi>religious Worſhip;</hi> nor any
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:007862_0058_102DEA9671BA4D08"/>
Thing more than what was common to pay to Perſons of Diſtinction among the <hi>Jews:</hi> Tho' I muſt confeſs I ſee no Reaſon to ſuppoſe it any other than <hi>ſuch</hi> Worſhip as the Diſciples refuſed to receive, becauſe they were <hi>Men;</hi> and <hi>ſuch</hi> as the <hi>Angel</hi> refuſed to receive from St. <hi>John,</hi> becauſe he was his <hi>fellow-Servant.</hi>—The very ſame Word is uſed in the Original, for <hi>that</hi> Worſhip which Chriſt received without any Heſitation, as for <hi>that</hi> which the Apoſtles and the Angel refuſed, becauſe they were <hi>Men</hi> and <hi>fellow-Servants.</hi> — From whence I might argue, That <hi>this</hi> was ſuch Worſhip as no Dignity of Office or Nature, ſhort of the DIVINE, was entitled to.</p>
            <p>BUT there are alſo various Inſtances where <hi>religious Worſhip and Homage</hi> was paid our Lord JESUS by the Apoſtles after his Aſcention.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THERE is no more <hi>immediate Act</hi> of Worſhip and Homage paid to Almighty GOD, than that of <hi>adoring Him,</hi> as the <hi>Creator</hi> and <hi>unchangeable Upholder</hi> of the Univerſe: And <hi>this Homage</hi> the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> Chap. 1.10, 11, 12, expreſly attributes to our Lord JESUS;— <hi>And, Thou Lord, in the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, haſt laid the Foundation of the Earth; and the Heavens are the Works of thy Hands; they ſhall periſh, but thou remaineſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Thou art the ſame, and thy Years ſhall not fail.</hi>— Now in what more ſolemn and <hi>immediate</hi> Manner can we addreſs the great GOD, and acknowledge and adore Him, as the Creator of Heaven and Earth; not to ſay, as an eternal, unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Being? 'Tis moſt <hi>immediately</hi> applied to Him;— <hi>And, Thou Lord,</hi>  and terminates in Him, without any Reſerve or Limitation. The Lord JESUS therefore, who is thus addreſſed, is the proper immediate and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Object of this ſolemn, <hi>religious Adoration.</hi>—</p>
            <p>Again,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE Apoſtles, in almoſt all their Epiſtles, <hi>Bleſs the Churches</hi> or <hi>Perſons</hi> to whom they wrote, in the <hi>Name</hi>
               <pb n="58" facs="unknown:007862_0059_102DEA982B8AA310"/>
of the Lord JESUS:—<hi>The Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt be with you,</hi> is the common Concluſion:—Which plainly implies an <hi>immediate</hi> Supplication or Prayer to CHRIST for Grace. And how <hi>Arian</hi> and <hi>Socinian</hi> Doctors can uſe this Apoſtolical Form of <hi>Bleſſing the Church,</hi> and acquit themſelves of Idolatry, or worſhipping a <hi>mere Creature,</hi> while they look upon the Lord Jeſus <hi>as ſuch,</hi> I muſt Confeſs is a Myſtery to me.</p>
            <p n="3">3. ST. <hi>Peter</hi> attributes <hi>everlaſting Praiſe and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> to CHRIST; See 1 Epiſt. 4.11, <hi>To whom be Praiſe and Dominion forever and ever,</hi> Amen. And, 2 Epiſt. Chap. 3. ult, <hi>To Him be Glory both now and forever,</hi> AMEN. — Strange Language this, to a <hi>mere Creature!</hi> —To <hi>One</hi> whoſe Praiſe, Dominion and Glory muſt <hi>ceaſe</hi> at the End of this World! —But not to multiply Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in ſo clear a Caſe, I ſhall only mention thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of <hi>religious Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Homage</hi> paid to CHRIST, Rev. 5.12, 13, 14, <hi>Saying, with a loud Voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain, to receive Power, and Riches, and Wiſdom, and Strength, and Honour, and Glory, and Bleſſing: And every Creature, which is in Heaven, and the Earth, and under the Earth,</hi> &amp;c,— <hi>heard I, ſaying, Bleſſing, and Honour, and Glory, and Power, be unto Him that ſitteth upon the Throne, and unto the Lamb forever and ever: And the four Beaſts, or living Creatures ſaid,</hi> Amen: <hi>And the four and twenty Elders fell down, and worſhipped Him that liveth forever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO conclude this Head; St. <hi>John</hi> tells us, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.22, in his Deſcription of the <hi>New-Jeruſalem,</hi> that he <hi>ſaw no Temple therein; for the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb are the Temple of it;</hi> and Ver. 23, <hi>The Lamb is the Light thereof:</hi>—Whence it plainly appears, that JESUS CHRIST, or the LAMB, ſhall be the Object of our Worſhip and Praiſe, after your Author diveſts Him of his Power, Dominion and Dignity.—When we ſhall no longer need a Temple made with Hands; when all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:007862_0060_102DEA9AD34E7588"/>
Ordinances, Means and Inſtruments of Worſhip ſhall ceaſe; then <hi>the Lord God Almighty, and the Lamb,</hi> ſhall be our Temple and our Sun; the Place and Object of our Worſhip and Praiſe ſhall be One, thro' an endleſs Eternity. — Thus it appears that JESUS CHRIST is, and forever ſhall be, the immediate, proper and ultimate Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the <hi>Worſhip</hi> and <hi>Homage</hi> of all created Beings.</p>
            <p>BUT your Author attempts to anſwer all that has been ſaid, or can be ſaid, to ſupport the Doctrine of CHRIST'<hi>S Divinity,</hi> at once, by offering it as his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that this ſubverts the Goſpel Doctrine of his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BEFORE I particularly examine and anſwer his Reaſons for this, I beg Leave to premiſe a few Things, <hi>viz.</hi> (1.) That a Conſideration of the plain Proofs and Arguments which have been offered for the <hi>ſupreme Deity</hi> of JESUS CHRIST, will make a wiſe Man exceeding cautious how he yields his Faith to the contrary, without plain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible Arguments, or an over-balance of Evidence and Proof either from Scripture or Reaſon, or from both. (2.) In Conſideration of what has been ſaid in Vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>ſupreme Deity</hi> of CHRIST, it would be fooliſh to deny and diſbelieve it, merely becauſe there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it myſterious, hard to underſtand, and above or beyond the Comprehenſion of our Reaſon.—To believe Things which are <hi>contrary</hi> to Reaſon or common Senſe; or to invent and forge Myſteries without any Foundation, and recommend them for Doctrines of Truth, which ought to be believed, is abſurd and fooliſh:—But to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is no Truth <hi>above,</hi> or <hi>beyond</hi> the Comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of our Reaſon, is equally ſo; eſpecially if they be ſuch as reſpect the divine Nature, Perfections and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, which are <hi>incomprehenſible;</hi> and which <hi>none by ſearching can find out.</hi>—Thus the ingenious and learned Doctor <hi>Leng</hi> obſerves, <q>That if a Revelation from GOD is neceſſary to teach us any Thing concerning the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

Nature, and his Deſigns towards Mankind, and in Relation to a future State, more than what we could naturally know before; it muſt of Neceſſity be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which our Reaſon could not diſcover: And as far as the Nature of an infinite Being is concerned in it, it muſt exceed our finite Capacities by the very Nature of Things; and yet the Belief of it, when ſo revealed, may be very reaſonable, ſo long as it implies no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</q>
— He adds, <q>And indeed it would be a much greater Prejudice againſt a Revelation's being from God, if it had no Marks in it of any Thing but what human Reaſon could have diſcovered without it.</q>
See <hi>Leng</hi>'s Serm. at <hi>Boyle</hi>'s Lect. Pag. 503. (3.) Before I diſtinctly conſider your Author's Opinion, I would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in general, what the common Notion of <hi>Trinitarians</hi> is; and that which I imagine he intends to oppoſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Jeſus Chriſt as our <hi>Mediator</hi>—It is briefly this, that in the one Godhead or Divine Eſſence there are three real Differences, or diſtinct Perſons, repreſented and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed in Scripture by the Names of <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy-Ghoſt:</hi> — That theſe Three <hi>equally</hi> partake of the One God-head, or divine Eſſence:— That the <hi>Second</hi> of theſe divine Perſons, (<hi>viz.</hi> the SON,) in order to the Redemption of Mankind from moral Evil and Depravity, and eternal Death and Miſery, (the juſt and neceſſary Conſequence of their Rebellion and Apoſtacy from God,) freely and voluntarily engaged to be our <hi>Mediator</hi> and <hi>Advocate,</hi> to vindicate the Honour and Authority of the divine Law, by aſſuming the human Nature into a <hi>perſonal Union</hi> with the divine; which in due Time he actually did, and hath forever vindicated and eſtabliſhed the Honour and Authority of the divine Law by his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Obedience and Sufferings: — That after his Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Sufferings were compleated, He, (the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus, perſonally united</hi> to the DIVINE NATURE) aſcended into Heaven, to the Place of GOD'S moſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate

Preſence and Glory; where He continues to offer and plead the Worth and Merit of his Obedience and Sufferings, in the behalf of Sinners; by virtue of which, divine Grace and Goodneſs, I mean <hi>moral and mental Excellencies,</hi> ſuch as are neceſſary to qualify us for a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Immortality, as well as <hi>natural Enjoyments,</hi> are freely diſpenſed to Mankind; and in particular to his true and ſincere Diſciples, who have this Confidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove others, that if they <hi>aſk any Thing in his Name, and agreeable to his Will, they are heard;</hi> and that, <hi>of his Fulneſs they ſhall receive, and Grace for Grace.</hi> — This in general is the common Notion thoſe have of JESUS CHRIST, as <hi>Mediator,</hi> who oppoſe your Author.</p>
            <p>LET us now inquire, Whether any Thing he has ſaid ſhews <hi>this Notion</hi> of JESUS CHRIST, as <hi>Mediator,</hi> to be falſe or inconſiſtent: And, Whether it is not perfectly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the <hi>Scripture Account</hi> of this Matter.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> then, IT is objected, <q>If we muſt have one who is <hi>ſupreme</hi> God and Man, for our <hi>Mediator</hi> with God; then, when we addreſs to Jeſus Chriſt as the <hi>ſupreme</hi> God, where is the <hi>God-Man</hi> that muſt be our <hi>Mediator</hi> with <hi>Him?</hi> To ſay, He mediates with <hi>Himſelf,</hi> is the ſame as to ſay, we muſt go to Him <hi>without</hi> a Mediator, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> IT is not pretended, that GOD, or the <hi>Deity</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, ſimply conſidered, is our <hi>Mediator</hi> with GOD;— nor yet, that Chriſt as <hi>meer Man</hi> is to be worſhipped: — But, agreeable to what has been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed, that the <hi>human</hi> Nature, or the <hi>Man</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, tho' as united to the <hi>divine,</hi> acts as <hi>Mediator.</hi>— So that when we addreſs to JESUS CHRIST as the <hi>ſupreme</hi> GOD, our <hi>Mediator</hi> is the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus</hi> united to the GOD, or <hi>divine Nature.</hi>—Where then is there any want of a <hi>Mediator?</hi>— Here is One, as truly and properly, as when we addreſs to GOD the Father, the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> or the <hi>human</hi> Nature as <hi>united</hi> to the <hi>divine,</hi> is

our <hi>Mediator,</hi> whether we addreſs, adore or worſhip the <hi>Deity</hi> of the Father, Son or Holy-Ghoſt.—But,</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, IT is objected, That this is ſtill to make Chriſt Mediator <hi>with Himſelf;</hi>—the <hi>Man Chriſt</hi> mediates with the <hi>God Chriſt:</hi>—Beſides, the <hi>Man</hi> is not <hi>God-Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> 'TIS true, This is ſuppoſing that Chriſt, as <hi>Man,</hi> but <hi>united</hi> to the <hi>divine Nature,</hi> mediates with <hi>Himſelf</hi> as GOD: But this by no means ſubverts the Doctrine of his Mediation, when we addreſs to Him as GOD: Nor yet does it make the Deity, which we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to, or adore, a Mediator <hi>with Himſelf.</hi>— The <hi>Man-Chriſt,</hi> as <hi>united</hi> to the <hi>divine</hi> Nature, is our <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> with GOD the <hi>Father, Son</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> — And this <hi>Man-Chriſt,</hi> 'tis not pretended, is to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to, adored, or worſhipped, as a <hi>divine</hi> Perſon; or the ultimate Object of our religious Homage; which would be groſs Idolatry. So that we neither include the Mediator, by whom we worſhip, and the Object of our Worſhip in One, nor confound them together.— We addreſs to JESUS CHRIST, as being <hi>the Brightneſs of the Father's Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon;</hi> Heb. 1.3. <hi>i. e.</hi> We adore and worſhip HIM as GOD, excluſive of any perſonal Union with <hi>our</hi> Nature; but we eſteem Him as <hi>Man</hi> united to the <hi>divine</hi> Nature, to be our <hi>Mediator;</hi> and <hi>as ſuch</hi> we go to GOD by Him. — Thus, When I pray to JESUS CHRIST, it is as GOD; and I humbly hope to be heard and anſwered thro' the <hi>Mediation</hi> of the <hi>Man</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, who is every Way qualified for this Office, by virtue of his <hi>Union</hi> to the <hi>divine Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT it will perhaps be objected; — Is not <hi>this</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing Mankind <hi>deſtitute</hi> of a <hi>Mediator</hi> till the <hi>Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of the SON of GOD? — If it be the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus</hi> that is the <hi>Mediator,</hi> — Who was Mediator before there was ſuch a Man? — And, Did not the DIVINE WORD (or LOGOS) immediately interpoſe and act as <hi>Mediator</hi>

upon the <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>our Firſt Parents,</hi> and ſo for 4000 Years before he was made Fleſh, or aſſumed the human Nature, and while the human Nature was a Child, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> TO remove theſe Difficulties, let it be obſerved, — <hi>Firſt,</hi> THAT the <hi>Mediation</hi> of Chriſt conſiſts of two Parts, the <hi>Interceſſory</hi> and <hi>Expiatory.</hi> Heb. 11.25, <hi>He ever liveth to make Interceſſion for them.</hi> 1 Pet. 3.18, <hi>For Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffered for Sins, the Juſt for the Unjuſt.</hi> And, Heb. 10.14, <hi>By one Offering he hath perfected forever them that are ſanctified,</hi> &amp;c. —</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> THE <hi>expiatory</hi> Part of Chriſt's Mediation is the <hi>Ground</hi> and <hi>Baſis</hi> of the <hi>Interceſſory.</hi> — To ſuppoſe an Advocate or Interceſſor who has nothing to plead or repreſent in Favour of thoſe he interceeds for, is abſurd: — And to ſuppoſe that our Interceſſor repreſents or pleads any perſonal Accompliſhments or Qualifications of Mankind in their Favour, is no leſs ſo. For would our perſonal Accompliſhments and Qualifications recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend us to GOD, we ſhould no longer need a Mediator or Interceſſor: Such an Office would be quite ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. —We muſt therefore conclude, that our Interceſſor has ſomething of his own to plead and repreſent in Favour of Mankind, in order to their obtaining the divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Forgiveneſs. — And if ſo, if this is the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Acceptance with God, that ſome One repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent an adequate Merit of his own in our Favour, we muſt conclude that the Mediator between God and Man, did actually plead and preſent an adequate Merit of his own in Favour of Man immediately upon his Fall; or as ſoon as he fell under ſuch Circumſtances as to need a Mediator, (which all agree was ſoon after his Creation and at the Time of his eating the forbidden Fruit,) other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe his Mediation would be inſufficient; <hi>i. e.</hi> The DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINE WORD did actually <hi>interceed</hi> for Man, and plead an adequate Merit in his Favour, immediately upon his Fall or firſt Tranſgreſſion. — But then,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:007862_0065_102DEAA6D0128080"/>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> LET it be obſerved, That the <hi>expiatory</hi> Part of this Mediation which is carrying on between God and Man, conſiſts in yielding perfect Obedience to, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the Penalty annexed to, the broken Law; and as the DIVINE WORD (or LOGOS) was incapable of either of theſe, ſo he could never plead in Man's Favour the actual Performance and Execution of this fundamental Part of the Mediation: He therefore (as hath been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed) <hi>engaged</hi> to vindicate the Honour and Authority of the divine Law, by aſſuming the human Nature into a perſonal Union with Himſelf; which, in theſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, was capable of performing <hi>this</hi> Part of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, of <hi>bringing in an everlaſting Righteouſneſs,</hi> or a Merit adequate to the Offences of all Mankind: — And <hi>this Engagement</hi> the DIVINE WORD, (or LOGOS) pleaded and repreſented in Favour of Mankind, till ſuch Time as the Engagement was fulfilled and executed by the Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Sufferings of the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> perſonally united to the LOGOS:— Hence He is ſtiled, <hi>The Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the World.</hi> — But ſince he hath performed the <hi>expiatory</hi> Part of the Mediation, <hi>He,</hi> the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as united to the DIVINE WORD (or LOGOS) <hi>ever-liveth</hi> to plead the actual Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance and Execution; and repreſent the Worth and Value of it in Favour of Mankind.— And, as <hi>the Man Chriſt Jeſus</hi> is perſonally united to the DIVINE WORD (or LOGOS,) ſo the ſame Perſon pleads and repreſents his perfect Righteouſneſs and bitter Death in our Favour, who pleaded and repreſented his Engagement to obey and ſuffer in Favour of Mankind immediately after their Fall. —The DIVINE WORD (or the LOGOS) and <hi>the Man Chriſt Jeſus</hi> are one Perſon:—Hence there ſeems to be a ſpecial Propriety in ſtiling <hi>our Mediator</hi> (when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him merely as ſuch) <hi>The Man Christ Jeſus;</hi> or <hi>the Man Chriſt Jeſus</hi> our <hi>Mediator.</hi> HE, as united to the DIVINE NATURE, actually performed the <hi>expiatory</hi> Part
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:007862_0066_102DEAA88036BBB8"/>
of the Mediation between GOD and <hi>Man;</hi> and tho' the Merit and Value of this was pleaded and repreſented in Favour of Mankind long before there was ſuch a Man; yet now <hi>He</hi> (the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as united to the DIVINE NATURE) ever lives to perform this; HE <hi>is our merciful and faithful High-Prieſt in Things pertaining to God, to make Reconciliation for the Sins of the People; for in that HE himſelf hath ſuffered, being tempted, HE is able to ſuccour them that are tempted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN ſhort, <hi>the Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> as united to the LO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GOS, was in effect the <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and Men from the Fall of our firſt Parents. He was ſuch by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement and Promiſe from the LOGOS; and the Merit and Value of his future Righteouſneſs and Sufferings, were repreſented in Favour of Man as ſoon as his fallen Circumſtances required any ſuch Recommendation.— If it be inquired, How <hi>this Promiſe and Engagement</hi> could be a ſufficient Ground of Man's Acceptance with GOD, and what Right the LOGOS had to enter into a Promiſe and Engagement, in which a Man to be born 4000 Years after, was ſo directly and immediately concerned?—<hi>I anſwer,</hi> That I ſee no way to ſolve this, if we allow the LOGOS to be no more than a <hi>meer Creature:</hi> But if we allow him to be TRUE GOD, the Anſwer is obvious and eaſy; for as GOD is unchangeable, and hath all Power, Wiſdom and Perfection, ſo his Promiſe and Engagement is as ſafe a Ground to act, believe and hope upon, as actual Performance and Execution: And as to his Right of making ſuch a Promiſe and Engagement; He had the ſame Right to do this, that he had to create Man or any other Being.—Beſides, as <hi>the Man</hi> who was ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and immediately concerned in the Fulfilment of this Promiſe, was to be perſonally united to the LOGOS who made it; ſo the Promiſe itſelf was Perſonal:— The Perſon that promiſed, was the Perſon that ſhould, and has, fulfilled this Promiſe; which effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves the ſuppoſed Difficulty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:007862_0067_102DEAABC2976038"/>BUT it is objected,</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, THAT the <hi>human</hi> Nature of Chriſt can never be an <hi>effectual</hi> Mediator, (according to thoſe your Author oppoſes,) No, not tho' it were <hi>perſonally united</hi> to the <hi>divine,</hi>— becauſe they deny this <hi>human</hi> Nature, <hi>ſo united,</hi> to have the Knowledge of the ſecret, mental Prayers, the inward Deſires and Diſtreſſes of all Chriſtians; or to know any one's Heart: And how then can He be a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate Interceſſor</hi> in Caſes he knows nothing of? &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> It is indeed denied, that the <hi>human Nature</hi> of Chriſt, tho' perſonally united to the <hi>divine,</hi> has an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent</hi> Knowledge of the Caſes and Deſires of Chriſtians, or the Hearts of Men, <hi>i. e.</hi> that Jeſus Chriſt knows all Things merely by virtue of his <hi>human Nature:</hi>—But it is acknowledged, that the <hi>divine Nature</hi> knows all Things; and that by virtue of the <hi>Union</hi> of the <hi>human Nature</hi> to it, all needed Knowledge is communicated or imparted from the GOD to the <hi>Man,</hi> to render the <hi>latter</hi> an <hi>effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Mediator,</hi> a <hi>compaſſionate Interceſſor,</hi> a <hi>merciful High-Priest</hi> and <hi>Advocate for us.</hi>—No Man in his Senſes ever yet pretended, that the <hi>Man Chriſt,</hi> who is our Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, could not and did not know the Caſes and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Mankind: But then it is denied, that he has an <hi>inherent</hi> Knowledge of theſe Things.—The Man Chriſt, who is our Mediator, knows our Caſes, Wants, Deſires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by virtue of its <hi>Union</hi> to the divine Nature: And ſurely your Author could not think <hi>his</hi> Mediation ineffectual on this Account, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe <hi>his</hi> Knowledge of our Caſes, Deſires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is not <hi>inherent</hi> in the <hi>human</hi> Nature, excluſive of the <hi>divine,</hi> to which it is united; ſince, for the very ſame Reaſon, he muſt renounce his own Account of the Mediator: For he ſuppoſes that <hi>his</hi> Knowledge comes by Revelation from GOD; if not univerſally and at all Times, yet in ſome Degree, and at ſome Times, and in particular the Knowledge he had of the Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi>—"If any ſhould aſk (ſays he, Pag.
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:007862_0068_102DEAAE712F00E0"/>
30.) <q>How Jeſus Chriſt comes to know all that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals in the ſeven Epiſtles to the ſeven Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the very firſt Words of the Book of the <hi>Revelations</hi> may be an Anſwer—It was <hi>the Revelation which God gave to Jeſus Christ,</hi> &amp;c.</q>—He adds, <q>No wonder then, that he ſays, He <hi>knows their Works,—their Hearts,—and their approaching Judgments,</hi> when his own vaſt Abilities are aſſiſted by God's Revelation.</q>—</p>
            <p>AND now let me inquire, How can Chriſt be an <hi>effectual</hi> Mediator, if he does not know the Caſes, Wants and Deſires of his Servants, but by Revelation from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, even the GOD he mediates with? — Nay further, your Author ſuppoſes our Mediator to be inhabited by and related to GOD, in order to this Office: By which Expreſſions, if he means any Thing, I think it muſt be this, <hi>viz.</hi> That He is immediately under the divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and Direction; is qualified for and aſſiſted in this Office by <hi>GOD himſelf:</hi>—And what Comfort or Hope can we have from this Mediation? The ſame GOD we addreſs to, muſt influence, direct and aſſiſt the <hi>Mediator,</hi> by whom we addreſs Him, and thro' whom we hope for Acceptance; and Almighty GOD influences, directs and aſſiſts <hi>one Creature</hi> to mediate with Him in the Behalf of <hi>another:</hi> And does not this make the Mediation of Chriſt all meer Form and Ceremony? 'Tis GOD influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, aſſiſts and directs in the Mediation;—'tis His Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs that is employed in the Mediation; and therefore the Mediation is in Effect his own:—It is GOD that mediates with <hi>Himſelf,</hi> by Jeſus Chriſt; and no longer Chriſt that mediates with GOD:—And in this View of the Thing, will it not be proper, when we addreſs to Almighty GOD, to beſeech Him in the firſt Place to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, direct and aſſiſt the Man Chriſt Jeſus to mediate with Him in our Behalf? And yet a Queſtion remains, By whom, or thro' whoſe Mediation ſhall we make this neceſſary Requeſt?—We muſt go directly and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:007862_0069_102DEAB0D7FDB170"/>
to GOD, and pray Him to direct, aſſiſt and reveal our Wants to our Mediator; or enable him to mediate for us: And what is this better than to have no Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor? Thus full and plain does your Author's Objection ſtand againſt his <hi>own Account</hi> of the Mediator; and has no Force at all againſt <hi>that</hi> which he oppoſes; becauſe it is not pretended that the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus</hi> is not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with our Caſes, Wants and Deſires by virtue of its <hi>Union</hi> to the <hi>divine</hi> Nature, ſo far as to render him an <hi>effectual</hi> Mediator and Advocate for us: But that the <hi>Man</hi> Chriſt has not this Knowledge inherently, or exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively of the <hi>Union</hi> of the <hi>human</hi> to the <hi>divine</hi> Nature.— The Knowledge of the <hi>Man</hi> Chriſt, or Mediator, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated or imparted to him from the <hi>divine Nature,</hi> or DEITY, by virtue of this Union, in a Manner diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from what is commonly called divine Revelation, or Inſpiration, ſuch as the Prophets and Apoſtles had:—But what the particular Modes and Properties of this <hi>Union</hi> are, or in what Manner and Degree the <hi>human</hi> partakes of the Powers and Properties of the <hi>divine Nature,</hi> by virtue of it, I ſhall not pretend to determine; it being vaſtly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Reach and Comprehenſion of my weak, ſhallow Reaſon: It is ſufficient for my preſent Purpoſe, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing your Author has offered in the leaſt militates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this Account of Chriſt's Mediation, or at leaſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what equally militates againſt his own.</p>
            <p>I SHALL now inquire, whether it be not every way a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to <hi>Scripture</hi> as well as <hi>Reaſon;</hi>—</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>. IT is not pretended, that the Scriptures any where tell us in expreſs Terms, or in juſt ſo many Words and Syllables, that there are <hi>THREE Perſons in the God-head,</hi> or ONE <hi>divine Eſſence.</hi>—But that the Godhead, or divine Nature, is ſpoken of under the Notion of <hi>three real Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,</hi> or <hi>Diſtinctions;</hi> I think beyond all Contradiction. St <hi>John</hi> tells us, 1 Epiſt. 5.7, <hi>There are</hi> three <hi>that bear
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:007862_0070_102DEAB34B0BF508"/>
Record in Heaven, the Father, the Word and the Holy Ghost; and theſe</hi> three <hi>are</hi> one;—And theſe <hi>three,</hi> the Father, the Word, (or Son) and the Holy-Ghoſt, are frequently ſpoken of as really <hi>diſtinct</hi> from each other.— St. <hi>John</hi> wiſhes to the elect Lady, <hi>Grace, Mercy and Peace from God the Father; and from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of the Father:</hi>—And our Saviour tells his Diſciples, John 14.26, <hi>But the Comforter, which is the Holy-Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my Name,</hi> &amp;c.—And we are baptized in the <hi>Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy-Ghoſt;</hi> and bleſſed in <hi>their Names diſtinctly,</hi> at the ſame Time, and <hi>ſeparately</hi> at different Times: Which both evidence that theſe Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are real; or, that they actually ſubſiſt in the divine Nature; and that they <hi>equally</hi> partake of all divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and Attributes: The <hi>ſame</hi> Perfections are attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to, and the <hi>ſame</hi> Worſhip and Homage paid, to <hi>each</hi> of theſe Diſtinctions or <hi>Differences.</hi>—The <hi>Father</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented and worſhipped as GOD <hi>ſupreme;</hi> and ſo is the <hi>Son,</hi> as hath been largely ſhewn; and the ſame might be made to appear of the <hi>Holy Ghost. Ananias</hi> is charged with <hi>lying to the Holy-Ghost,</hi> Acts 5.3. It follows in the next Verſe, <hi>Thou haſt not lyed unto</hi> Men, <hi>but unto</hi> GOD; So the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> is ſaid to have <hi>dictated</hi> the Scriptures, 2 <hi>Peter,</hi> 1.21. But it's needleſs to multiply Texts of this Nature.—There is the ſame Evidence in Scripture, that there is a <hi>Son,</hi> and an <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> as that there is a <hi>Father;</hi> and there is likewiſe the ſame Evidence that the <hi>Son</hi> is GOD, and that the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is GOD, as that the <hi>Father</hi> is GOD: The <hi>ſame</hi> Perfections are attributed, the <hi>ſame</hi> Worſhip is paid to <hi>each, diſtinctly</hi> and <hi>ſeparately,</hi> as to <hi>them all, jointly</hi> conſidered, as <hi>one divine Eſſence</hi> or <hi>Nature.</hi>—And now, What ſhall we call theſe <hi>Diſtinctions</hi> in the <hi>one</hi> divine Nature or Godhead?

ſubſiſting in the <hi>one</hi> God-head or Deity, is <hi>above</hi> our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, and what we can frame no juſt and adequate Ideas of. But I proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>, IT is not pretended that the Scriptures any where expreſsly aſſert, that the SON of GOD, the divine LOGOS, or the SECOND Diſtinction or Difference in the Deity, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed a <hi>human</hi> Soul and Body into a <hi>perſonal Union</hi> with Him: But thus much the Scriptures plainly and expreſsly teach us, that JESUS CHRIST had a Body, and a Soul; and that he is <hi>truly</hi> GOD, or a <hi>divine Perſon.</hi> That Jeſus Chriſt had a true and real Body is indiſputable: That he had a Soul or Spirit, ſuch an intelligent, active Principle as is common to all Men, I think none can doubt who read the <hi>New-Teſtament:</hi> We find that his Reaſon, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and Judgment, were gradual or progreſſive; as is the Caſe with all Men, however ſuperior and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive they might be: Luke 2.40.52, <hi>And the Child grew, and waxed ſtrong in Spirit,</hi> or, by the Spirit, <hi>filled with Wiſdom:—And Jeſus increaſed in Wiſdom and Stature, and in Favour with God and Man.</hi>—And the ſame Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Affections are found in Him, that are common to all Men; and are the Appendages of human Nature in its Original; ſuch as Love, Joy, Sorrow, Compaſſion, <hi>&amp;c.—He wept over</hi> the City of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> at a View of their Stupidity, Hardneſs of Heart and approaching Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Luke 19.41.—He loved, and groaned and wept over <hi>Lazarus,</hi> John 11.33. — And how <hi>exceeding ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful,</hi> grieved and dejected was he at the Proſpect of his own Sufferings, Matth. 26, <hi>My Soul is exceeding Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, even unto Death.</hi>—John 12.27, <hi>Now is my Soul troubled, and what ſhall I ſay?</hi>—Thus it appears beyond all reaſonable Contradiction, that JESUS CHRIST had a <hi>true Body</hi> and a <hi>reaſonable Soul;</hi> or ſuch an intelligent, active Principle as is common to all Men: — And (as hath been largely ſhewn) the Scripture no leſs plainly, expreſsly and diſtinctly repreſents Him as <hi>true</hi> GOD, or a

            <p>MOREOVER, If our <hi>Mediator</hi> be a <hi>mere Man,</hi> or <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> as your Author ſuppoſes, it will be difficult to ſhew what End his <hi>Mediation</hi> anſwers; or what Hope or Comfort we can poſſibly derive from it, however He be dignified and exalted by his natural Endowments, and appointed Character or Office.— JESUS CHRIST is repreſented as our <hi>Atonement</hi> before the injured DEITY; and as our <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> as <hi>being made a Curſe for us;</hi> as <hi>bearing the Chaſtiſement of our Peace: He hath appeared to take away Sin, by the Sacrifice of Himſelf;</hi>—and <hi>hath by once offering up Himſelf, forever perfected thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve:</hi> He came to <hi>reconcile</hi> the World of Sinners to the offended DEITY, by <hi>offering Himſelf without Spot;</hi>— and <hi>as by the Tranſgreſſion of one, many were made Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; ſo by the Obedience of one, ſhall many be made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous:</hi>—But how can theſe Things be effected, any more by the Sufferings and Obedience of CHRIST (if a <hi>mere Man,</hi> or <hi>created Being</hi>) than by thoſe of any <hi>other</hi> Man? His great Endowments, his dignified Office, or any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived Excellency cannot qualify Him for it: Theſe will not enable Him to <hi>do</hi> or <hi>ſuffer</hi> any Thing on <hi>our</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, by Way of Atonement; becauſe, <hi>from him, to whom much is given, ſhall much be required:</hi>—GOD Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty juſtly expects a Return from every Creature in Proportion to the Powers and Abilities they are endowed with, and the Office and Character they ſuſtain in the Univerſe: This is evident from natural Reaſon, and the famous Parable of the Talents:—And therefore, if JESUS CHRIST be a <hi>mere Creature,</hi> he can do nothing for us, by Way of Atonement with the offended DEITY. — Again,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:007862_0079_102DEAC74176EC78"/>
JESUS CHRIST is repreſented as our <hi>Interceſſor</hi> and <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate</hi> in Heaven; as Him <hi>by whom only we can have Acceſs to GOD:</hi> — But if a <hi>mere Man,</hi> of what Service can He be to us there?—What has he to plead that can gain us Audience and Acceptance, to recommend our imperfect Prayers and Services to the DEITY, more than another Man?—His knowing our Caſes, Wants and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and pitying them, can be to no Purpoſe, in Point of our being heard, accepted and anſwered by the divine Majeſty; for He cannot be a Means of informing HIM <hi>who knows all Things:</hi> And he has nothing to repreſent, or plead in our Behalf, if a <hi>mere Creature;</hi> he hath done no more than was his Duty, and is the Duty of every created Being, <hi>viz.</hi> to be ſubmiſſive, reſigned and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the Will and Pleaſure of the Creator, whether it be to do or ſuffer. To conclude this Head:—According to your Author's Account of the <hi>Mediator,</hi> we have no rational Grounds to hope for the divine Mercy and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, thro' his <hi>Mediation</hi> or <hi>Interceſſion:</hi> GOD'S being reconcileable to us, by or thro' CHRIST JESUS, is mere Sound:—We may no longer with any Propriety plead the Merits, the Atonement, the Obedience and Sufferings of CHRIST, before Him, under a Notion or Hope of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard and anſwered on their Account:— And, in one Word, We may no longer aſk any Thing of Him, in CHRIST'S Name or for <hi>his</hi> Sake, intending by it, that He would be graciouſly pleaſed, in Conſideration of what CHRIST hath done and ſuffered for Sinners, to hear, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, and anſwer us; for Chriſt is a <hi>Creature,</hi> as well as <hi>we;</hi> and at moſt has done no more than improve and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the Powers and Faculties, Gifts and Accompliſhments beſtowed upon him, agreeable to the Will and Pleaſure of his Creator.—Thus entirely does your Author ſubvert the Doctrine and Worth of CHRIST'S <hi>Mediation:</hi>—Thus does it overthrow the Hope of Chriſtians;—neceſſitating us to deſpair of the divine Mercy and Forgiveneſs; or

ſeek it ſome other Way, than by and thro' the <hi>Merits</hi> and <hi>Mediation,</hi> or <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Sufferings</hi> of our Lord JESUS CHRIST.</p>

cautious how we follow them, leaſt it be at the Expence of Truth; and leaſt, by avoiding what their Pride and Oſtentation, their imaginary Wit and Penetration, ſtiles Nonſenſe and Contradiction, we ſhould fall into that which is truly ſuch; as all Doctrines that are repugnant to the <hi>Word of</hi> GOD, are.</p>
            <p>THE next Thing your Author flies to is, St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Deſcription of the Lord JESUS, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.22, and 36, <hi>Ye Men of Iſrael, hear theſe Words, Jeſus of Nazareth, a Man approved of God among you,</hi> &amp;c.—<hi>And let all the Houſe of Iſrael know aſſuredly, that God hath made that ſame Jeſus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Chriſt.</hi> —'Tis true in theſe Words the Apoſtle is aiming at ſuch a Deſcription of CHRIST, as might ſtrike his Murderers with Horror, and bring them to a true Repentance of their Crime; and therefore he deſcribes Him as to his <hi>Humanity;</hi> which alone was capable of ſuffering and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing murdered:—To have told his Audience, that they had killed the <hi>infinite GOD</hi> himſelf, would have been to the laſt Degree abſurd and fooliſh; and inſtead of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to a Senſe and Repentance of their Crime, would have expoſed him to their Ridicule and Scorn:— He therefore tells them, that the <hi>Man</hi> they had crucified <hi>was approved of God among them, by Miracles, Signs and Wonders, which God did by him;</hi> and that now <hi>God had made the ſame Man both Lord and Chriſt;</hi> which is not denied:—But in this ſame Speech he gives plain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations, that JESUS CHRIST was not a <hi>mere Man,</hi> when he refers to the Words of <hi>David,</hi> concerning Him, <hi>The Lord ſaid unto my Lord,</hi> &amp;c. Ver. 34. With theſe Words our Saviour confounds the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who anſwered, that <hi>Chriſt was the Son of David,</hi> meaning that he was a <hi>mere Man,</hi> Mat. 22.42: But, ſays our Saviour, <hi>David cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him Lord</hi> in Spirit, or by divine Inſpiration; <hi>and if David call him Lord, how is he his Son?</hi> Our Saviour no doubt intended, that this repreſented <hi>Christ,</hi> or the
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:007862_0082_102DEACCDF6FB6D8"/>
               <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> to be ſomething <hi>more</hi> than a <hi>mere Son of David,</hi> or <hi>merely a Man;</hi> or elſe it will be difficult to make Senſe of what he ſays, or apply his Words to any wiſe and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Purpoſe: And therefore ſince St. <hi>Peter</hi> applies <hi>theſe</hi> to CHRIST, in his Deſcription of Him, before his Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, he might with the utmoſt Safety direct thoſe of them that were convinced, and inquired, <hi>What they ſhould do to be ſaved?</hi> to <hi>believe in</hi> this <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſuch as he had deſcribed Him, and <hi>be baptized in</hi> his <hi>Name;</hi> which is both an Evidence and an Acknowledgment of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; it being a moſt ſolemn Act of <hi>religious Worſhip,</hi> paid to CHRIST <hi>perſonally</hi> and <hi>immediately,</hi> as hath been already ſhewn.</p>
            <p>I SHALL take but a very brief and curſory View of your Author's SECT. III. with which he concludes his Argument; as it cannot poſſibly be thought to have much Weight in it to ſupport his Cauſe; and as I have already drawn out this Letter vaſtly beyond what I at firſt intended.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt</hi> then, IT is acknowledged, That GOD and CHRIST, if we hold to the ſtrict <hi>Etymology</hi> of the Word CHRIST, cannot be properly predicated one of the other; the Name CHRIST, in its primary and moſt proper Senſe, <q>ſignifies <hi>one anointed,</hi> and raiſed by Authority and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour conferred;</q> as we acknowledge the <hi>Man Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> or the <hi>Humanity</hi> of our Saviour to be, Heb. 1.9, <hi>God, even his God, hath anointed him with the Oil of Gladneſs above his Fellows:</hi>—But we muſt remember his Name is JESUS, as well as CHRIST; the Import of which we may ſee, Matth. 1.23, <hi>it is</hi> Emmanuel, <hi>which being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted is,</hi> GOD <hi>with us:</hi> So that if we may not with the ſtricteſt Propriety, or agreeable to the <hi>Etymology</hi> of the Name, call Chriſt GOD, becauſe it ſignifies one <hi>anointed,</hi> &amp;c. yet we may thus ſtile JESUS CHRIST; for his being called JESUS, imports Him to be <hi>Emmanuel,</hi> or GOD <hi>with
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:007862_0083_102DEACE8A49F8E0"/>
us.</hi>—<q>But if the Buſineſs can be ſalved here, by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing a <hi>perſonal Union</hi> between GOD and CHRIST, or JESUS, and the <hi>Anointed;</hi> Why may not the <hi>Papists</hi> ſet up another ſuch <hi>Union</hi> between CHRIST'S Body, and the Bread, in the <hi>Eucharist;</hi> and ſtoutly defend, that 'tis the <hi>Body of Chriſt</hi> properly?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer</hi> (1<hi rend="sup">st</hi>) BECAUSE there is no ſuch Foundation in Scripture for ſuppoſing that the Bread in the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> is the Body of Chriſt <hi>ſubſtantially,</hi> as that GOD and CHRIST, or the <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>human</hi> Natures, are <hi>united</hi> to each other <hi>Perſonally.</hi>—And, (2<hi rend="sup">dly</hi>.) Becauſe the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Doctrine of <hi>Tranſubſtantiation</hi> is of a very different Nature from that in diſpute: It ſuppoſes a real <hi>Change</hi> of the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> contrary to the united Judgment and Teſtimony of our Reaſon and Senſes; but this cannot be objected in the preſent Caſe: There are therefore good Reaſons why the <hi>Papiſts</hi> cannot maintain or defend the Doctrine of <hi>Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubstantiation</hi> with the <hi>ſame</hi> Juſtice and Propriety, that we can the <hi>Divinity</hi> of our Saviour; or the <hi>Union</hi> of the divine and human Natures in the Perſon of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> I SHALL not pretend to determine what Uſe ſome may have made of the baffled Arguments of <hi>Papiſts,</hi> when they wrote againſt the <hi>Unitarians,</hi> in Vindication of the <hi>Divinity</hi> of <hi>Chriſt:</hi>—But this I am bold to affirm, that they have no need to do it in one ſingle Inſtance;—and that they have not done it in the Inſtances your Author mentions, 1. No one ſurely at this Day pretends, that the Novelty of <hi>Arian</hi> Principles is much of an Objection againſt them, (as the <hi>Papiſts</hi> hold that the Novelty of <hi>Proteſtantiſm</hi> is againſt that:) Alaſs! They are <hi>antique</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to claim our Veneration, if <hi>that</hi> alone was ſufficient, having been extant at Times for almoſt 1500 Years; paſſed thro' various Changes and fancied Emendations; been once and again ſuppreſſed and revived in <hi>Europe, Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa;</hi> obtaining ſometimes in a very ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:007862_0084_102DEAD0ACBEDD50"/>
Manner, thro' that Love of Novelty, which is rooted in our Nature; but have never obtained long at once, to any conſiderable Degree, in either of thoſe Parts of the World: Allow me to gueſs the Reaſon,—That when they become common, and their Novelty ceaſed to recommend them; when Men come to calm and ſerious Conſideration, they eaſily ſee their <hi>Fallacy</hi> and <hi>dangerous Tendency,</hi> and quickly rejected them. This is the Novelty objected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps by ſome againſt your Author's Opinion, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is no Commendation to it; and I humbly truſt, (if nothing elſe will do it) that this will prevent its obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long, and to any great Degree in <hi>New-England.</hi> — 2. It is judged, That our Saviour's being ſtiled, the <hi>Image of God,</hi> is no Argument that He is not GOD; and yet 'tis thought at the ſame Time a probable Argument, That the Fathers did not look upon the Elements to be <hi>changed</hi> into the real Subſtance of CHRIST'S Body and Blood, in the Senſe which <hi>Papiſts</hi> hold, becauſe they oft call them the <hi>Images</hi> thereof. There is too manifeſt a <hi>Difference</hi> between theſe Propoſitions, to need any Illuſtration: It is not ſuppoſed, That CHRIST is called the <hi>Image of</hi> GOD with reſpect to his <hi>Humanity;</hi> for that can bear but a faint Reſemblance to the DEITY, to which nothing may be likened or compared; but that He is the <hi>Image</hi> of GOD, i. e. of the <hi>Father,</hi> in reſpect of His <hi>Divinity:</hi> The <hi>ſecond</hi> Diſtinction or Difference in the DEITY is the <hi>expreſs Image</hi> of the <hi>firſt.</hi> On the other Hand, The <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſuppoſe the Elements to be tranſubſtantiated or changed into the <hi>real</hi> Subſtance of CHRIST'S Body and Blood; but had the <hi>Fathers</hi> thought ſo, they could with no Propriety have called them <hi>the Images</hi> thereof. CHRIST is called the <hi>Image</hi> of GOD in oppoſition to GOD the <hi>Father;</hi> but the <hi>Papiſts</hi> leave nothing to oppoſe the <hi>Image</hi> to.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In Oppoſition to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> 'tis tho't evident, That St. <hi>Peter</hi> was <hi>inferior</hi> to the Church, and the reſt of the Apoſtles (tho' not ſingly to each,)
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:007862_0085_102DEAD2F96D2818"/>
becauſe he was <hi>ſent</hi> up and down by them: — And yet it is no Argument that the <hi>Son</hi> is <hi>inferior</hi> to the <hi>Father,</hi> in Oppoſition to <hi>Trinitarians,</hi> becauſe he was <hi>ſent</hi> by Him. — Here again, is a manifeſt Difference in the Poſition and Circumſtances of the Arguments: — It is not the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Eſſence,</hi> but the <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> that is in diſpute: 'Tis argued, that in <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> he was <hi>inferior</hi> to the Church, and the reſt of the Apoſtles, becauſe they ſent him up and down <hi>authoritatively:</hi> — On the other Hand, the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Eſſence</hi> of the SON, is in diſpute; and 'tis hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tho't, that it can be argued with no Propriety that the SON was <hi>inferior</hi> to the FATHER in <hi>theſe,</hi> merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe He was <hi>ſent</hi> by Him: <hi>e. g.</hi> A <hi>Son</hi> may be as truly a <hi>Man</hi> as the <hi>Father,</hi> and yet be <hi>ſent</hi> by him; or <hi>two,</hi> that <hi>equally</hi> partake of human Nature and all it's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, may ſend <hi>each other</hi> by mutual Agreement.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> THERE can be no juſt Grounds for your Author's Complaint, "That <hi>Trinitarians</hi> join with the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in hood-winking People in Ignorance; forbidding them to enquire into and examine your Author's Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples." — I can't think that any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> will inveigh againſt the cloſeſt Examination and Enquiry into any of the Principles and Doctrines of our holy Religion; and eſpecially the more <hi>important</hi> and <hi>fundamental</hi> Points of it.— For my own Part, I heartily wiſh your Author's Opinion may meet with this Treatment wherever it goes; as I humbly think it will prove a moſt effectual Means of ſecuring Men againſt it.—I therefore intreat all Men, cloſely to examine, and ſeriouſly to conſider it, in all it's Parts, before they embrace it.—</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> How juſt your Author's Claim is to <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Antiquity,</hi> is what I cannot determine; nor what poor Apologies have been made for thoſe Fathers who ſeem to have favour'd <hi>his</hi> Principles: — This can be no ways material; ſince our Faith is not, and ought not,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:007862_0086_102DEAD539BF9D78"/>
to be built upon the <hi>Opinion of the Fathers,</hi> or, <hi>Tradition of the Elders;</hi> but, upon that <hi>ſurer Word of Propheſy,</hi> and <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> the HOLY SCRIPTURES:— Upon the <hi>Foundation of the</hi> Prophets <hi>and</hi> Apoſtles, JESUS CHRIST <hi>Himſelf being the Chief Corner-Stone.</hi>— However, It is generally allowed, that <hi>Arius</hi> a <hi>Preſbyter</hi> of the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> about <hi>Anno Domini</hi> 320, was the firſt who reduced your Author's Principles to a regular Syſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem; or ſet them up in Oppoſition to thoſe who hold to the <hi>ſupreme</hi> DEITY of JESUS CHRIST: —His Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were immediately condemn'd for <hi>Hereſy,</hi> by a Council under <hi>Alexander</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> and afterwards, <hi>Anno</hi> 325, by <hi>three Hundred and eighty</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the General-Council of <hi>Nice.</hi>— After which, the Diſciples of <hi>Arius</hi> divided into ſeveral Parties:— <hi>Some</hi> held, That the <hi>Son</hi> was made <hi>ex non entibus;</hi> and that He was in <hi>all</hi> Reſpects <hi>unlike</hi> the Father: <hi>Others</hi> held, That the Son was <hi>like</hi> the Father, and begot of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; tho' not <hi>Co-eternal</hi> with Him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the <hi>ſixth</hi> Century it was carried into <hi>Africa,</hi> under the <hi>Vandals;</hi> and into <hi>Aſia,</hi> under the <hi>Goths; Italy,</hi> the <hi>Gauls,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> were alſo deeply infected with it:—But having reigned <hi>thirty</hi> Years with great Splendor, it ſunk almoſt all at once.— After which it made no great Noiſe in the World, till <hi>Anno</hi> 1531, <hi>Servetus,</hi> a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> wrote a ſmall Treatiſe againſt the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the <hi>Trinity;</hi> which gave Occaſion, after his Death, to the forming a new Syſtem of <hi>Arianiſm</hi> in <hi>Geneva;</hi> the Admirers of which preſently degenerated into <hi>Socinians,</hi> who are likewiſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into ſeveral Parties; ſome leaving <hi>Socinus,</hi> as to what regards the Worſhip to be offered to Jeſus Chriſt; not being able with all their Penetration, added to the ſubtle Reaſoning of their Maſter, and all that have ſince appeared to ſupport his Cauſe, to ſee how divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhould be given a mere Man. See <hi>Chamb. Dict.</hi> Art. <hi>Arianiſm</hi> and <hi>Socinianiſm.</hi>

               <pb n="86" facs="unknown:007862_0087_102DEAD768BBEEC8"/>FROM this general View, it appears, your Author will not gain much by appealing to <hi>Antiquity,</hi> the Fathers, and the genuine Hiſtory of his Principles.</p>
            <p>HE thinks, <q>The Fathers were more likely to attribute too much, than too little, to <hi>Jeſus Christ,</hi> as he was, and is deſervedly a beloved Object, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> THEY were at moſt but <hi>fallible, imperfect</hi> Men:—Beſides, we muſt conſider them either as Wiſe and Honeſt, or Ignorant and Deceitful: If they were <hi>Ignorant</hi> or <hi>Deceitful,</hi> either not underſtanding the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Truth of the Cauſe they were engaged in; or diſpoſed to betray it; their Teſtimony, one Way or the other, is not to be regarded: And if they were <hi>Wiſe</hi> and <hi>Honeſt,</hi> underſtanding the Cauſe and Truth of Chriſtianity, and were real, ſincere Friends to it; they would have endeavoured to repreſent Things in their true Light; to preach and recommend the naked unadulterated Truth, and have carefully guarded againſt Error on every Side; and eſpecially in <hi>fundamental important Points;</hi> ſuch as the <hi>preſent</hi> confeſſedly is: When they come to deſcribe our <hi>Lord</hi> JESUS, the Author of this Religion, one would think they ſhould have ſtudied for the exacteſt Truth; and have been as careful not to attribute too much, as too little, to Him; and to be ſure not to attribute <hi>that</hi> to Him, which belongs to GOD only, if he is not GOD; ſince it is no leſs diſhonoring and affronting to Almighty GOD, to <hi>raiſe</hi> a <hi>mere Creature</hi> to an <hi>equality</hi> with Him, than it is to <hi>debaſe</hi> the Lord JESUS, by eſteeming and repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Him as a <hi>mere Creature,</hi> if He be GOD <hi>ſupreme.</hi>—The Truth of the Caſe (I am ready to think) is, That it was much with the Fathers, as with their Sons of the preſent <hi>Day;</hi> they generally profeſſed to build their Faith or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Principles upon divine Revelation; in order to which, ſome wiſely examin'd the <hi>whole Current</hi> and <hi>Tenor</hi> of Scripture, before they drew up an abſolute determinate Concluſion; others, of a more ſudden Reſolution and

haſty Genius, conſidered only <hi>particular Texts</hi> and <hi>Phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes;</hi> ſuch perhaps as favoured ſome <hi>darling</hi> Prepoſſeſſion, and formed their Opinion with leſs Thought and Delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: And though the <hi>former</hi> were by much the faireſt Candidates for Truth, and to be depended upon with the moſt Safety; yet they were <hi>all fallible;</hi> their Writings are not the <hi>Standard</hi> of Truth, nor the <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Meaſure</hi> of our Faith, while we have the <hi>Words</hi> of <hi>Inſpiration;</hi> which are <hi>profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs; that the Man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furniſhed unto all good Works:</hi> And which <hi>we</hi> are, or ought to be, as capable of examining and underſtanding as our <hi>Fathers</hi> have been; and have as good a Right to judge and determine for <hi>ourſelves,</hi> as <hi>they</hi> had.—</p>
            <p>THUS I have gone through with my intended <hi>Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations</hi> upon your Author's <hi>Inquiry into the Scripture Account of</hi> JESUS CHRIST; and deſignedly omitted no Part of his Reaſoning, that can poſſibly be tho't material: I am, however, far from thinking that I have offered all the Arguments which can be produced againſt his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; or ſet off thoſe I have offered to the beſt Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: But I humbly imagine, they carry ſo much of <hi>Truth</hi> in them, as entirely to overthrow and confute whatever your Author has oppoſed to them; and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſecure every honeſt, conſiderate, unprejudiced Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who reads them, even in their preſent Dreſs, againſt his Opinion. I can't but hope, theſe Hints, imperfect as they are, contain proper Grounds of Conviction; and that having <hi>theſe</hi> laid before you, agreeable to your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the <hi>Dedication,</hi> you will readily alter your Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: — If this ſhould be the Caſe, I am tar from deſiring a publick Confeſſion, or Declaration of Gratitude;—The Thought of having been the Means of <hi>turning one from the Error of his Way,</hi> will be a ſufficient Reward to me.

—If you ſhould anſwer this by a profound Silence, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be <hi>ſuperficial,</hi> and to carry its own Confutation with it; and to be utterly unworthy either of public or private Notice, one Way or another,—I have the Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of reflecting on my own good Deſign; and of thinking that ſuch a ſullen, ill-natured <hi>Silence,</hi> but poorly ſupplies the Place of <hi>ſolid Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Argument;</hi> and that at leaſt ſome others are of the ſame Opinion.—If, on the other Hand, you ſhould think <hi>this</hi> deſerving of an Anſwer, and capable of a Refutation, I ſhall endeavour, with the utmoſt Candor and Impartiallity, to read and conſider it;—lay myſelf open to Conviction; and yield the Point with Joy and Gratitude, whenever I ſee an over-balance of <hi>fair</hi> Reaſoning, againſt my preſent Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.—If you ſhould not chuſe to diſpute the Point, (as I pray may be the Caſe, for Diſputes of this Nature rarely tend much to promote the Cauſe of Religion) but ſhould find ſome Things <hi>unſatisfactory</hi> to you in Point of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, I ſhall endeavour, upon Information, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move your Difficulties and Objections with the utmoſt Pleaſure and Satisfaction.—After all, I can't but appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that your procuring a new Impreſſion of your Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's <hi>Inquiry,</hi> will fail of that good Effect, which you profeſs to hope for from it; and declare to be the great Inducement which moved you:—Granting that it ſhould be univerſally embraced and believed;—Where is the great Service done to the Cauſe of Chriſtianity?— Will any Perſon by this, be made a better Subject to his King; a more uſeful Member of Society; or more pious and devout towards his GOD? Indeed if it be the <hi>Truth,</hi> Men ought to know it, and believe it; and <hi>Truth</hi> can never injure that Religion which is founded upon it; and which is, or ought to be, ſupported by it: — But we ſhould be well aſſured, that we have <hi>Truth</hi> on our Side, before we attempt to bring about ſuch Revolutions and Changes in Religion, as this <hi>Tract</hi> muſt make, if uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally

imbraced in <hi>New-England.</hi>—We ſhould alſo be aſſured, that <hi>this Truth</hi> more or leſs affects the Eſſentials of Religion; that the eternal Salvation of Mankind is affected by it, before we can be excuſed in ſuch an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: But ſurely true <hi>Unitarian</hi> Charity, which extends to all Men, at leaſt to all Denominations of Chriſtians, would not ſuffer you to judge thus of the Point before us, that it is a <hi>ſine qua non;</hi> or abſolutely neceſſary to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life, that Men believe with your Author:—And therefore the Importance of the Subject, in the Light which <hi>Unitarians</hi> commonly conſider it in, will but poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excuſe you in ſo glaring and dangerous an Attempt, as a Revival of this <hi>old Controverſy,</hi> in this <hi>new World,</hi> evidently is. — In ſhort, if you cloſely adhere to the Principles, which you have ſo generouſly taken under your Patronage, I ſee no Way that you can excuſe your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for diffuſing them abroad, with ſuch a profuſe Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality, and Air of Challenge, any more than a ſerious <hi>Atheist</hi> could excuſe himſelf for publickly calling in Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>Being of a GOD;</hi> and pleading with great Zeal and Earneſtneſs, that there is no ſupreme, wiſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Being, who made and governs the World, and to whom we are accountable for our Behaviour:—Such an one might plead that he had <hi>Truth</hi> of his Side; but he could not juſtly plead the leaſt Proſpect that <hi>this Truth</hi> would be of any Service to Mankind, tho' vindicated by ever ſo ſpecious an Appearance of Demonſtration:— The ſame holds good with Regard to true <hi>Unitarians:</hi>— They can't, conſiſtent with their own Principles, pretend that the denying or not believing the <hi>Divinity of</hi> JESUS CHRIST, will be of any great Service to Mankind, or to the Cauſe of Chriſtianity; becauſe they hold that <hi>all</hi> Chriſtians are agreed in the <hi>eſſential</hi> Points.—I can't therefore but ſuſpect, either that you are not well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Principles you eſpouſe; or that ſome <hi>other Motive,</hi> than a true Love to the Cauſe of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;

and a ſincere Deſire to promote it, induced you to ſuch an Attempt:—Charity obliges me to hope that the former of theſe is the Caſe; and that when you come to a more calm and ſerious Conſideration of your Principles, if you do not renounce them, yet, that you will think it of leſs Importance to the Cauſe of Chriſtianity, that all Men embrace them.—Not that I at preſent fear that your utmoſt Efforts to maintain and diffuſe them, will be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a general Succeſs: But it is my ſincere De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that this Controverſy may ſtop here; as it's of ſuch a Nature as to admit of no determinate Deciſion, beyond all Poſſibility of Contradiction on <hi>either</hi> Side:—For in Diſputes of this Kind, an ambitious, ſubtle Wit will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver want nice Diſtinctions to evade the <hi>Truth,</hi> and cover over <hi>Falſhood</hi> with the Appearance of it.</p>
            <p>IT may perhaps be thought by ſome, That I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Revival of this Diſpute:—That a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Silence would have been the moſt prudent Anſwer to your Author, and your own Challenge:—That the former hath been repeatedly anſwered already:—That the Diſpute is endleſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>—But I humbly beg Leave to diſſent from ſuch; (1.) Becauſe Silence would undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring the Cauſe I maintain under Suſpicion, with many of the unlearned and unſtable Multitude. (2.) Whatever Anſwers may have been made to <hi>this Tract</hi> already, they are not common as this now is among us; and therefore tho' vaſtly ſuperior to what I have offered, can be of no immediate Service to this Part of the World.

Tho' this Diſpute is in a Senſe endleſs, as it cannot at preſent be determined beyond all Poſſibility of Contradiction; yet when a Point ſo important, as that of our bleſſed SAVIOUR'S DIVINITY is generally eſteemed to be, comes to be called in Queſtion, denied, and laughed at; I think it becomes thoſe who ſincerely believe it, to lend their ſeaſonable Aſſiſtance to ſupport and maintain it, in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their Ability and Sphere in Life; and tho' it

be not capable of <hi>abſolute</hi> Demonſtration; yet a <hi>rational</hi> Vindication of it, eſpecially at ſuch a Time, can't but be of Service to the Cauſe of Religion, by the divine Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: The Lord JESUS grant theſe imperfect Hints may have this happy Effect, tho' offered by one of the leaſt of thoſe who <hi>adore His</hi> DEITY. In ſhort, I humbly imagine that, in Conſideration of the Manner and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the <hi>Dedication</hi> and <hi>Tract itſelf,</hi> ſhould it paſs un-noticed in this public Manner, the vulgar Opinion will be, that it's <hi>unanſwerable,</hi> at leaſt as to <hi>our Teachers</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Guides.</hi>—Theſe Conſiderations induced me to an Attempt, which more properly belongs to my Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors in Ability: — And an earneſt Deſire, and ſecret Hope, that ſome one, more equal to the Taſk, would have engaged in it; has delayed this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> for ſome Weeks: And ſhould any one be engaged, or diſpoſed to engage, I am far from deſiring to monopolize the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; but ſhall be heartily glad of their kind Aſſiſtance, whether it ceaſes here, or is carried on further.</p>
            <p>TO conclude; THIS is not wrote for <hi>Diſpute</hi> ſake; but with a ſincere Love to, and honeſt Deſire of, promoting and vindicating <hi>Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Cauſe of Chriſtianity:</hi>— And ſhould the Diſpute be prolonged; I heartily join with your Author, in wiſhing, That it may be carried on with <hi>Moderation</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian Charity:</hi> That all Wrath, Malice, Envyings and Revilings, may be laid aſide; and that <hi>Truth, ſacred Truth,</hi> may be every Man's Aim. — I pray GOD to deliver both Parties from that oſtentatious <hi>Strife of Words,</hi> thoſe ill-natured Cenſures, bitter Reflections and uncharitable Railings, which are truly a Reproach to our Nature, a Scandal to our chriſtian Profeſſion, an Injury to pure and undefiled Religion, and a Grief and Offence to all good Men:—</p>
            <p>SHOULD any one attempt, a further Vindication of your Author's Principles, in a fair and rational Manner, I hope there are none among us, but will give it a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did

and impartial Conſideration: — But ſhould any one, in order to this, ſupply the Place of ſolid Arguments, with barbarous Criticiſms, and pert witty Reflections upon his Oppoſers; ſtudying to turn their Opinion and Arguments into Ridicule and Banter, inſtead of giving them a fair Confutation; inſinuating, That there is as good a Foundation for affirming, that there are <hi>Four</hi> as <hi>Three</hi> Perſons in the God-head; That we may, with as much Propriety, ſtile the Virgin <hi>Mary, God,</hi> or <hi>Goddeſs</hi> the <hi>Mother,</hi> as <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, God</hi> the <hi>Son;</hi> reflecting upon all his Oppoſers as <hi>Babblers of Nonſenſe and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,</hi> and the like; ſuch an one, I ſay, whether a <hi>Layman,</hi> or <hi>D. D.</hi> tho' he might ſhine and blaze a while like the <hi>Son of the Morning,</hi> would quickly draw upon himſelf the Contempt of the <hi>bad,</hi> and the Pity of the <hi>good:</hi> All Men of Reaſon and ſober Thought would deſpiſe him, for ſtudying to render <hi>that</hi> ridiculous, which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever falſe, fooliſh and groundleſs ſome may think it to be, ought to be treated in the moſt ſerious Manner, 'till it is ſhewn to be ſo: But I hope, and pray, that nothing of this Nature will ever appear. Good Senſe and ſound Reaſon I deſire to attend to, wherever I ſee it; and who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it comes from:—But <hi>Cant</hi> and <hi>Banter</hi> ſhould be <hi>abhor'd</hi> by all Men, eſpecially in Things of a <hi>religious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and Importance.—</p>
            <p>THE Lord prepare us all for that State and World, where <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſhall eternally agree: Where all Strife and Controverſy ſhall ceaſe; and, where we ſhall no more diſpute <hi>who</hi> and <hi>what</hi> our glori us MEDIATOR is; but ſhall <hi>ſee Him as He is:</hi> To HIM be Glory both now and evermore. AMEN.</p>
