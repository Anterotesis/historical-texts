            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>His Majeſty will withdraw all his troops and garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from all poſts and places within the boundary lines aſſigned by the treaty of peace to the United States.

They ſhall be at full liberty to remain there, or to remove with all or any part of their effects; and it ſhall alſo be free to them to ſell their lands, houſes, or effects, or to retain the property thereof, at their diſcretion; ſuch of them as ſhall continue to reſide within the ſaid boundary lines, ſhall not be compelled to become citizens of the United States, or to take any oath of allegiance to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, but they ſhall be at full liberty ſo to do if they think proper, and they ſhall make and declare their election within one year after the evacuation afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid. And all perſons who ſhall continue there after the expiration of the ſaid year, without having declared their intention of remaining ſubjects of his Britannic Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, ſhall be conſidered as having elected to become citizens of the United States.</p>

                  <p>It is agreed that it ſhall at all times be free to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's ſubjects, and to the citizens of the United States, and alſo to the Indians dwelling on either ſide of the ſaid boundary line, freely to paſs and repaſs by land or

inland navigation, into the reſpective territories and countries of the two parties, on the continent of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica (the country within the limits of the Hudſon's bay Company only excepted) and to navigate all the lakes, rivers and waters thereof, and freely to carry on trade and commerce with each other. But it is underſtood, that this article does not extend to the admiſſion of veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the United States into the ſea ports, harbours, bays, or creeks of his Majeſty's ſaid territories; nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch parts of the rivers in his Majeſty's ſaid territories as are between the mouth thereof, and the higheſt port of entry from the ſea, except in ſmall veſſels trading bona fide between Montreal and Quebec, under ſuch regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as ſhall be eſtabliſhed to prevent the poſſibility of any frauds in this reſpect. Nor to the admiſſion of Britiſh veſſels from the ſea into the rivers of the United States, beyond the higheſt ports of entry for foreign veſſels from the ſea. The river Miſſiſippi, ſhall, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, according to the treaty of peace, be entirely open to both parties; and it is further agreed, that all the ports and places on its eaſtern ſide, to whichſoever of the parties belonging, may freely be reſorted to and uſed by both parties, in as ample a manner as any of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic ports or places of the United States, or any of the ports or places of his Majeſty in Great-Britain.</p>
                  <p>All goods and merchandize whoſe importation into his Majeſty's ſaid territories in America, ſhall not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely prohibited, may freely, for the purpoſes of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, be carried into the ſame in the manner aforeſaid, by the citizens of the United States, and ſuch goods and merchandize ſhall be ſubject to no higher or other duties, than would be payable by his Majeſty's ſubjects on the importation of the ſame from Europe into the ſaid territories.

And all goods not prohibited to be exported from the ſaid territories reſpectively, may in like manner be carried out of the ſame by the two parties reſpectively, paying duty as aforeſaid.</p>
                  <p>No duty of entry ſhall ever be levied by either party on peltries brought by land, or inland navigation into the ſaid territories reſpectively, nor ſhall the Indians paſſing or repaſſing with their own proper goods and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of whatever nature, pay for the ſame any impoſt or duty whatever. But goods in bales, or other large packages unuſual among Indians ſhall not be conſidered as goods belonging bona fide to Indians.</p>

But as by this ſtipulation it is only meant to ſecure to each party a free paſſage acroſs the portages on both ſides; it is agreed, that this exemption from duty ſhall extend only to ſuch goods as are carried in the uſual and direct road acroſs the portage, and are not attempted to be in any manner ſold or exchanged during their paſſage acroſs the ſame, and proper regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be eſtabliſhed to prevent the poſſibility of any frauds in this reſpect.</p>
                  <p>As this article is intended to render in a great degree the local advantages of each party common to both, and thereby to promote a diſpoſition favorable to friendſhip and good neighbourhood, it is agreed, that the reſpective governments will mutually promote this amicable intercourſe, by cauſing ſpeedy and impartial juſtice to be done, and neceſſary protection to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all who may be concerned therein.</p>

                  <p>And whereas the difficulty of agreeing on the preciſe caſes in which alone proviſions and other articles not generally contraband may be regarded as ſuch, renders it expedient to provide againſt the inconveniencies and miſunderſtandings which might thence ariſe: It is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther agreed, that whenever any ſuch articles ſo becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contraband according to the exiſting laws of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhall for that reaſon be ſeized, the ſame ſhall not be confiſcated, but the owners thereof ſhall be ſpeedily and completely indemnified; and the captors, or in their default the government under whoſe authority they act, ſhall pay to the maſters or owners of ſuch veſſels the full value of all ſuch articles, with a reaſonable mercantile profit thereon, together with the freight, and alſo the demurrage incident to ſuch detention.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it frequently happens that veſſels ſail for a port or place belonging to an enemy, without knowing that the ſame is either beſieged, blockaded or in veſted; it is agreed, that every veſſel ſo circumſtanced
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031412_0020_0FEC523890D50948"/>
may be turned away from ſuch port or place, but ſhe ſhall not be detained, nor her cargo, if not contraband, be confiſcated, unleſs after notice ſhe ſhall again attempt to enter; but ſhe ſhall be permitted to go to any other port or place ſhe may think proper: Nor ſhall any veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel or goods of either party, that may have entered into ſuch port or place, before the ſame was beſieged, bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaded, or inveſted by the other, and be found therein after the reduction or ſurrender of ſuch place, be liable to confiſcation, but ſhall be reſtored to the owners or proprietors thereof.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I AM honored with yours of Auguſt 30th. Mine of the 7th of that month aſſured you that meaſures were taken for excluding from all further aſylum in our ports, veſſels armed in them to cruize on nations with which we are at peace, and for the reſtoration of the prizes the Lovely Laſs, Prince William Henry, and the Jane of Dublin; and that ſhould the meaſures for reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titution fail in their effect, the Preſident conſidered it as incumbent on the United States to make compenſation for the veſſels.</p>
               <p>We are bound by our treaties with three of the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligerent nations, by all the means in our power to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and defend their veſſels and effects in our ports, or waters, or on the ſeas near our ſhores, and to recover and reſtore the ſame to the right owners when taken from them. If all the means in our power are uſed, and fail in their effect, we are not bound by our treaties with thoſe nations to make compenſation.</p>
               <p>Though we have no ſimilar treaty with Great Britain, it was the opinion of the Preſident, that we ſhould uſe towards that nation the ſame rule, which under this article, was to govern us with the other nations; and even to extend it to captures made on the high ſeas, and brought into our ports: if done by veſſels which had been armed within them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:031412_0028_0FEC525302A97CF0"/>Having, for particular reaſons, forbore to uſe all the means in our power for the reſtitution of the three veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels mentioned in my letter of Auguſt 7th, the Preſident thought it incumbent on the United States to make com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for them: And though nothing was ſaid in that letter of other veſſels taken under like circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancces, and brought in after the 5th of June, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the date of that letter, yet when the ſame forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance had taken place, it was and is his opinion, that compenſation would be equally due.</p>
               <p>As to prizes made under the ſame circumſtances, and brought in after the date of that letter, the Preſident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, that all the means in our power ſhould be uſed for their reſtitution. If theſe fail, as we ſhould not be bound by our treaties to make compenſation to the other powers in the analogous caſe, he did not mean to give an opinion that it ought to be done to Great-Britain. But ſtill if any caſes ſhall ariſe ſubſequent to that date, the circumſtances of which ſhall place them on ſimilar ground with thoſe before it, the Preſident would think compenſation equally incumbent on the United States.</p>
               <p>Inſtructions are given to the governors of the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtates, to uſe all the means in their power for reſtor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prizes of this laſt deſcription found within their ports. Though they will of courſe take meaſures to be informed of them, and the general government has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them the aid of the cuſtom-houſe officers for this purpoſe, yet you will be ſenſible of the importance of multiplying the channels of their information as far as ſhall depend on yourſelf, or any perſon under your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, in order that the governors may uſe the means in their power for making reſtitution.</p>
               <p>Without knowledge of the capture they cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore it. It will always be beſt to give the notice to them directly; but any information which you ſhall be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſend to me alſo at any time ſhall be forwarded to them as quickly as diſtance will permit.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:031412_0029_0FEC525808808380"/>Hence you will perceive Sir, that the Preſident con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templates reſtitution or compenſation in the caſe before the 7th Auguſt; and after that date, reſtitution if it can be effected by any means in our power. And that it will be important that you ſhould ſubſtantiate the fact<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſuch prizes are in our ports or waters.</p>
               <p>Your liſt of the privateers illicitly armed in our ports is, I believe, correct.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to loſſes by detention, waſte, ſpoliation ſuſtained by veſſels taken as before mentioned, between the dates of June 5th and Auguſt 7th, it is propoſed as a proviſional meaſure, that the collector of the cuſtoms of the diſtrict, and the Britiſh conſul, or any other perſon you pleaſe, ſhall appoint perſons to eſtabliſh the value of the veſſel and cargo, at the time of her capture and of her arrival in the port into which ſhe is brought, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their value in that port. If this ſhall be agreeable to you, and you will be pleaſed to ſignify it to me, with the names of the prizes underſtood to be of this deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription, inſtructions will be given accordingly, to the collector of the cuſtoms where the reſpective veſſels are.</p>
