            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>BRIEF CONSIDERATIONS ON SLAVERY, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE religious and moral Obligations we are under in a private capacity, to do our utmoſt to promote the true intereſts of mankind, encreaſe with our powers and opportunities of action. Hence ariſes the importance of that truſt, which the wiſdom of government has repoſed in legiſlatures; in diſcharging which, having the will, they have alſo the power of promoting thoſe intereſts in the moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual manner. The object therefore, which I now take the liberty of recommending to their attention, has an indiſputable claim to it; not only from its impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as relating to the community, but from a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration which muſt give it great additional weight with every generous mind—the incapacity of thoſe on whoſe behalf it is ſolicited, to plead their own cauſe. It is the caſe of the enſlaved Africans—a caſe which tho' familiarized to us by cuſtom, is yet in all its parts ſo replete with affecting circumſtances, that perhaps it has not its parallel in the hiſtory of any period of time; and attended with the particular aggravation, of being acted under a government, remarkable above all others for the excellence of its conſtitution, and the equity of its laws. How it has happened that a nation, which has ſo eminently diſtinguiſhed itſelf in aſſerting the common rights of mankind, and which has ſo often generouſly interpoſed its power for the relief
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012701_0003_0F8C2DE3ACBE73D8"/>
of its oppreſſed neighbours, ſhould tolerate ſo griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous an infringement of liberty in its own dominions, is difficult to comprehend. But my intention is not to expatiate on the inconſiſtency of theſe generous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions of its power, with the toleration of the African ſlave-trade. I hope it may be attributed to the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and weight of other engagements, which have ſo much engroſſed the attention of government, that the iniquitous nature of this traffick has not been adverted to; for certainly an acquaintance with it, could only be neceſſary for its ſuppreſſion. But without a further inveſtigation of the <hi>cauſe,</hi> it is more to my preſent purpoſe, to confine myſelf to ſuch conſiderations, as being duly attended to, may aſſiſt the <hi>cure</hi> of this malignant diſorder in the body politick. With this view, I ſhall briefly conſider its inconſiſtency with the divine, as well as the ſocial law; its impolicy and evil tendency; and then endeavour to point out the moſt probable means by which the evil may be remedied.</p>
            <p>IT cannot be denied that Slavery was allowed to the Iſraelites by the Moſaic law, under certain circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and reſtrictions; yet it differed from this of the Africans in ſeveral important particulars. Their bondmen and bondwomen enjoyed many privileges; and in the year of Jubilee, liberty was proclaimed unto all the inhabitants of the land. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, a large part of our poor African ſlaves, have no ground to expect the moſt diſtant admiſſion to liberty, for either themſelves, or their lateſt poſterity. But even though we may conceive Slavery to be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable to the precepts given under that diſpenſation; yet to every unprejudiced mind, it muſt appear totally repugnant to the ſpirit and deſign of the goſpel, the import of which was announced to the world, in a manner awfully expreſſive of its ſuperior excellence,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012701_0004_0F8C2DE4628FE298"/>
proclaiming <q>Glory to GOD in the higheſt; peace on earth; and good will to men.</q> Theſe glorious purpoſes, our bleſſed Saviour, when perſonally among men, inculcated by his example and doctrines; and, to give theſe greater efficacy, finally ſealed them with his blood. Various were the precepts he delivered, but thoſe relating to our ſocial duties, are all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in that excellent command, <q>Therefore whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them; for this is the law and the prophets.</q> Mat. 7.12. St. Paul's opinion of thoſe concerned in the practice now under conſideration, appears by his enumerating them among a number of atrocious offenders for whom the law was made, viz. <q>Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers of fathers; murderers of mothers; man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlayers; whoremongers; them that defile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with mankind; menſtealers,</q> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>THAT it is alſo an offence againſt the ſocial law, cannot be contradicted; for this law is founded on the neceſſity of mutual ſecurity, and a reciprocation of benefits; and by the light of our natural reaſon, we cannot find a rule better adapted to promote theſe ends, than that I have quoted from the vii. of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew; to which both Chriſtians and Pagans have joined in giving the diſtinguiſhing appellation of <hi>the golden rule.</hi> The celebrated Monteſquieu and many others who have made the rights of mankind their particular ſtudy, aſſert that men univerſally have an inherent title to Liberty; and the author I have named, with no leſs ſtrength than vivacity of reaſoning, has refuted thoſe ridiculous arguments, which intereſted men have been obliged to adduce, in ſupport of a pretended opinion, that the colour or unpoliſhed manners of the Africans, can operate againſt their claim to this firſt of temporal enjoyments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:012701_0005_0F8C2DE6E00A7FD8"/>IN theſe northern provinces there are not very many, who are immediately concerned in the trade to Africa for Slaves; nor is the number of theſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed people very conſiderable, when compared with that of many other colonies. Hence ſome, though admitting the injuſtice of the ſlave trade in general, may yet be unwilling to view it as a matter ſufficiently important for the extraordinary interpoſition of a legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature; being perhaps inſenſibly biaſed by intereſt, the prevalence of cuſtom, or the example of leſs enlightened times; thus leſſening the force of thoſe objections which calm reflection had ſuggeſted. I would ſubmit to the conſideration of ſuch, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated diſtreſs theſe poor creatures ſuffer, in being forceably torn from that portion of happineſs, which the allwiſe Creator allotted to them in their native ſtate; to ſuſtain for life, a bondage which, in our ſouthern colonies and iſlands, is more cruel and oppreſſive than the moſt of us in the northern colonies have had an opportunity of forming any idea of. Add to this, the bloody wars occaſioned by this infernal trade—the great proportion of them who die on the paſſage to, and in what is called the <hi>ſeaſoning</hi> in America; and can we then heſitate a moment, in determining on the expediency of contributing whatever lies in our power to diſcourage it. It is true ſome of our forefathers, and ſome of the preſent generation, may have been, and yet are in the practice of buying and ſelling ſlaves. The reaſons againſt it, but a few years ago, were not ſo well underſtood as they now are. The opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of information are become more frequent; and the uſage of them in general among us, has been leſs likely to excite an inquiry into the nature of the trade, and our title to their ſervices. The practice of ages cannot ſanctify error; but the progreſs of reformation has, in all, been gradual. I doubt not there are now
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012701_0006_0F8C2DE792972F90"/>
many men in England, whoſe integrity we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, but who, for want of proper information or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the ſubject, do yet admit the right of the Britiſh parliament to tax the colonies; but we are not, for that reaſon obliged to admit it. Having thus briefly conſidered the ſlave-trade as contradictory to the divine and ſocial law, it is needleſs to urge the impropriety of any, and eſpecially a free people being in anywiſe concerned in it. I ſhall therefore proceed to conſider the particular inconveniences attending it, with reſpect to the community.</p>
            <p>THAT the trade is attended with many inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of an evil and impolitic tendency, has been lately clearly ſet forth by ſeveral writers. It will be ſufficient for me to enumerate a few of them. Every thing that debaſes the mind, unfits it for ſociety; and this is a diſtinguiſhing characteriſtick of Slavery, which natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuppreſſes every generous expanſion of the mind. Monteſquieu, in his ſpirit of laws ſaith, <q>That nothing more aſſimilates a man to a beaſt, than living among freemen, himſelf a ſlave: ſuch people as theſe are the natural enemies of ſociety; and their number muſt always be dangerous.</q> Therefore the having ſlaves in our families or neighbourhood, muſt have a pernicious effect on the principles and morals of our young people and ſervants. May we not fear that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and morality, induſtry and publick ſpirit, have nearly declined in proportion as it has been encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?—The riches of a free ſtate conſiſts in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of members, who enjoying its privileges and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings, are thereby intereſted in its preſervation and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement. Every ſlave among us occupies the room of a free perſon, and not only leſſens the riches of the ſtate by diminiſhing the number of its friends, but adds one to that of its internal enemies; for ſuch every one
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012701_0007_0F8C2DE883824CD8"/>
muſt be accounted, who can derive no hope from its proſperity, and may poſſibly be benefited by its ruin.<note n="*" place="bottom">Admitting this, what danger muſt attend our ſouthern colonies, in ſome of which, the proportion of ſlaves to freemen is greater than as twelve to one?</note> While on the other hand, every ſervant on the expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a limited ſervitude, ſetting out with the anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hope of acquiring an independence in the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and of enjoying the bleſſings of life, and the protection of the laws, heartily unites in promoting the proſperity of his country; and, as that hope is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered with ſucceſs, becomes more and more deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in its ſafety: the beneficial effects of this on our lands and produce, are very extenſive, and too obvious to need a recital.—In the preſent conteſt between Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Britain and her colonies, it ſeems particularly neceſſary on our parts to convince her, that our oppoſition to her claims is not merely from ſelfiſh motives—not only made becauſe they happen to affect <hi>our</hi> particular inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts; but from a diſintereſted generous love to liberty, founded on principle—on publick virtue, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction that it is the unalienable right of man. But how can ſhe believe this, when, ſo loudly complaining of her attacks on our political liberty, all the colonies tolerate, and many of them greatly encourage this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent invaſion of natural liberty; ſubjecting the Africans not only to the deprivation of all property, but even to the moſt abject ſtate of perpetual perſonal ſlavery? If we ſuppoſe the divine bleſſing is neceſſary to enſure us ſucceſs in aſſerting our rights; of how much conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is it, that we ſhould practiſe the part enjoined by the divine command, <q>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them?</q> If pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er only muſt determine our right, how little have we to expect? On the other hand, were we armed with conſcious innocence, and ſupported by the juſtice of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012701_0008_0F8C2DE8F8EE14D8"/>
our cauſe; what have we to fear? With what confidence might we urge our claims? But as a late writer on this ſubject obſerves, <q>If we need the help of the negroes; ſo does Great-Britain need our help to pay off their national debt. If we deſire to grow rich, and reſt at eaſe by their toils and labours; ſo does Great-Britain deſire the ſame at our expence. So that while we perſiſt in this practice of enſlaving the Africans, our mouths ought to be entirely ſhut, as to any duties and taxes which Great-Britain may ſee cauſe to lay upon us. Otherwiſe I ſee not, but that out of our own mouths, or by our own practice, we may be juſtly condemned.</q>
            </p>
            <p>HAVING given my ſentiments on a trade and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, which, to uſe the words of the author of <hi>An eſſay in vindication of the continental colonies of America,</hi> 
               <q>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy rejects; juſtice condemns; and piety diſſuades;</q> I ſhall, from the ſame reſpectable author, add, <q>Shall Americans perſiſt in a conduct which cannot be juſtified; or perſevere in oppreſſion, from which their hearts muſt recoil? If the barbarous Africans ſhall continue to enſlave each other; let the daemon ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very remain among them, that their crime may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude its puniſhment. Let not Chriſtians, by admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtering to their wickedneſs, confeſs their religion to be a uſeleſs refinement, their profeſſion vain, and themſelves as inhuman as the ſavages they deteſt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I CANNOT believe there are any in the chriſtian faith, who have attentively, and diſpaſſionately conſidered the ſubject, but will adopt the opinion, that Slavery, in any caſe, cannot be juſtified—that, as it is conducted in the African trade, it is a moſt cruel, tyrannical and violent invaſion of the ſacred rights of mankind; and highly offenſive to Almighty God—that it is impolitick in its
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012701_0009_0F8C2DEE3B053508"/>
nature—that the practice of buying and ſelling ſlaves among ourſelves is an evident encouragement of the trade; and that the encouragement of it, by any means, is inconſiſtent with our civil and religious intereſts. If we thus believe, it is certainly our indiſpenſable duty in every ſtation, publick or private, to exert ourſelves for its ſuppreſſion, whatever difficulties may be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended to attend its final accompliſhment. The preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of cuſtom are ſtrong—thoſe imbibed from intereſt, yet ſtronger. But in ſuch a cauſe, we may be aſſured the bleſſing of Omnipotence will attend our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors, and in due time crown them with ſucceſs; not within our own limits only; but our example will moſt probably have a happy influence on the conduct of others more remote. It lies in our power, in ſome meaſure, to atone for the wrongs our anceſtors or our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have inadvertently impoſed on theſe oppreſſed people in time paſt.</p>
            <p>IS not then the firſt and moſt important ſtep, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to prohibit any future importations into theſe colonies. If by royal inſtructions, our governors are prevented the exerciſe of their own judgments; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial addreſſes to the crown, would be likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the difficulty. The ſenſe of the people, conveyed by their repreſentatives to the royal ear, on ſo intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſubject, muſt prevail, with a prince whoſe virtues have endeared him to his people, although it ſhould be oppoſed by men, comparatively few in number; whoſe avarice may continue to render them inſenſible to the common feelings of humanity, and whoſe GOD is gain. If we cannot obtain a <hi>total</hi> prohibition of the importation, we ſhall certainly be indulged in obtaining it for the colonies which petition for it. Even ſhould we fail here, the conſcious ſatisfaction of having done our duty, will be a reward ſufficient for the labour.</p>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:012701_0010_0F8C2DF0CE200B08"/>WITH reſpect to the ſlaves already among us, the caſe is more difficult, and will conſequently occaſion a diverſity of ſentiments on the proper means of effecting their enlargement. The firſt queſtion is, What does juſtice require? This being determined, the honeſt mind will endeavour to practiſe it. There are many of this character, who, in purſuing the inquiry, have inclined to an opinion, that ſome of theſe unhappy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are unfit for liberty; and that their manumiſſion would be attended with ruin to themſelves. Such a ſtate of depravity is not impoſſible, and nothing ſo likely to occaſion it, as a long continuance in the ſituation they have been in. I wiſh there may not be many inſtances of this kind. Where it happens to be the caſe, and the poſſeſſor, after carefully diveſting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of any ſiniſter bias, can juſtify a detention on this motive, I ſhall not controvert his right to exerciſe his judgment. There are alſo many, who not being yet ſufficiently acquainted with the ſubject, to ſee the iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the practice, do not apprehend the neceſſity of releaſing their ſlaves. As theſe would be inclined to oppoſe, and thoſe I have before mentioned, for other reaſons, may be rather averſe to a general and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate manumiſſion; we may perhaps infer the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency of poſtponing that deſirable work to a period more favourable to our wiſhes. In reformations of all kinds, where conviction precedes converſion, the effect is moſt permanent. But no objections occur to me, to the framing ſuch laws, as will leave people at liberty to emancipate their ſlaves under certain reſtrictions.</p>
            <p>AS the laws ſtand at preſent in ſeveral of our north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern governments, the act of manumiſſion is clogged with difficulties that almoſt amount to a prohibition. An amendment is therefore neceſſary; and may be effected with advantage to the community. We may ſuppoſe
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012701_0011_0F8C2DF186A33418"/>
all the laws alluded to, are intended to ſecure the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick from being chargeable with any expence, in caſe the manumiſed ſlave ſhould by age, ſickneſs, or other diſability, become incapable of ſupporting himſelf: and a proviſion of this nature ſeems highly reaſonable in certain caſes. If, for inſtance, a ſlave is become aged and infirm in my ſervice, it is unreaſonable I ſhould have it in my power, by manumiſſion to deny him a ſupport from my eſtate, to which perhaps his labour had contributed. But if, on the other hand, I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no other benefit from his labour, than what was a proper compenſation for the inſtruction I have given him, and the publick afterwards receives that benefit, it is then as reaſonable, that the publick ſhould be chargeable with any expence, occaſioned by ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability. This ſeems to be the general principle on which our laws relating to <hi>paupers</hi> are formed; and I ſee no inconvenience in adopting it in the caſe now under conſideration.</p>
            <p>ADMITTING then, that if a ſlave is ſet at liberty at the age of twenty-one years, the publick afterwards receives all the benefit of his labour, it will follow that I may ſet him free at that age, clear of any charge or incumbrance on my eſtate. If I detain him longer, and then give him his liberty, the ſame reaſoning ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that if the publick is afterwards liable to ſupport him, in caſe of diſability, I muſt pay the publick a certain ſum of money proportionable to the time of ſuch detention exceeding twenty-one years. No gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rule can be exactly adapted to all caſes. But I believe a law formed on theſe principles, would not only greatly tend to the relief of individuals, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move ſome objections, to which I apprehend the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent laws of ſeveral provinces are liable; particularly thoſe which permit manumiſſion on the maſter's enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012701_0012_0F8C2DF1F0E159F8"/>
ſecurity for the payment of a certain ſum, in caſe the ſlave ſhould be diſabled from maintaining himſelf. Now as this depends on a diſtant contingency, an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the circumſtances of the maſter and his ſureties, (if any are required) may effectually diſable him or them from making good their engagements. Whereas in the mode I propoſe, the money due on every manumiſſion which requires it, being paid to a proper officer, remains ſecure with the publick. And if the ſlave on whoſe account it was paid, ſhould never want any aſſiſtance, the fund allotted for the purpoſe will be ſo much the richer; which is a conſiderable advantage in its favour.</p>
            <p>SOME may think it neceſſary that no manumiſſion ſhould legally operate in all circumſtances, beyond a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain age. The difficulty which would generally occur in determining the age of a negro, might be removed by enabling a magiſtrate to convene three or five men, who, or a majority of them, after hearing ſuch evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as could be adduced, and judging from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, ſhould declare their judgment of his or her age. Theſe, with many other particular conſiderations, will doubtleſs be properly attended to, whenever a matter of this conſequence, comes under the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate notice of a legiſlature. Some difficulty may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend aſcertaining with preciſion the ſums which will be neceſſary to pay, at the reſpective ages of manumiſſion, to ſecure the publick from any unjuſt burden. It is a matter that requires judgment, and a particular kind of calculation with which I am but little acquainted. But as it may further explain what I have ſuggeſted; I will venture a few more hints on the ſubject.</p>
            <p>I underſtand that on emancipating a ſlave in Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, the law requires ſecurity ſhould be entered
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012701_0013_0F8C2DF2AECC6860"/>
for 30l. without any regard to age, or any other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; and that if the perſon ſo emancipated, ſhould afterwards require aſſiſtance, any expence exceeding that ſum, is paid by the townſhip to which he or ſhe may belong. Although this mode is liable to ſome exceptions, for reaſons before given, I have never heard of any burden, ariſing therefrom, occaſioning any uneaſineſs among the people of that province. Hence we may infer that the ſum of 30l. has been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally found ſufficient for the purpoſe. By the Breſlau bills of mortality, it is found that the chances are equal, that a man of fifty years of age will live ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years. Let us conſider what inconveniences might ariſe, if 20l. was paid on the manumiſſion of a ſlave of that age, who afterwards lived ſeventeen years, in the firſt ten of which, we will ſuppoſe he could ſupport himſelf by his labour; and that in the remaining ſeven he required aſſiſtance, the expence whereof amounted to 30l. which, as before-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, experience has found to be ſufficient. Now 20l. put to intereſt (or applied to the other uſes of the fund, which is the ſame thing) for ten years, at ſix per centum per annum, amounts to 32l. which leaves a balance in favour of the publick of 2l. beſides the intereſt ſtill ariſing on the decreaſing principle, after the firſt ten years, and the benefit of his labour; which would further increaſe that balance. If this calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is juſt, (and if it is erroneous, I think the error is in favour of the publick) it will be a publick advantage to permit manumiſſion on theſe terms; and if it takes place at forty, a much leſs ſum will anſwer the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and ſo in a decreaſing proportion to the age of twenty-one years, when, as has been before ſhewn, nothing can be juſtly expected. Now we find that if, on the manumiſſion of a ſlave between the years of twenty-one and fifty, fourteen ſhillings is paid to the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012701_0014_0F8C2DF3622EFDE8"/>
publick for every year his or her age exceeds twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>one, it will bear a very near proportion to 20l. paid on a manumiſſion at fifty, as above ſtated. I may be miſtaken in the method I have taken to determine the ſufficiency of that ſum; but I am ſo confident that the community would feel no inconvenience from adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, that, had I a ſufficient eſtate to authorize the propoſal, I ſhould not fear deriving a conſiderable advantage from undertaking to ſupport all the negroes ſo manumitted, who required aſſiſtance, with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies ſo paid; excluſive of the benefit accruing to the community from their labour, in which I ſhould be only intereſted as an individual.</p>
            <p>THUS I have ſtated, and propoſed a method for ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling the account, as it ſtands, on a manumiſſion, with the publick. There are many who, cheerfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with theſe terms, would alſo remember that in ſome caſes, there is another account depending between them and their ſlaves: and any encouragement or aſſiſtance they may ſuppoſe it their duty to give them in conſideration of paſt ſervices, will ſtill leſſen the riſque of their ever becoming chargeable to the publick.</p>
            <p>TO conclude—the object I have propoſed, has an undoubted claim to the moſt ſerious conſideration of people of all ranks, and of every denomination; for juſtice is confeſſedly alike obligatory on all. If to relieve the perſon of a ſingle debtor from a temporary impriſonment, has repeatedly been admitted as a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient call for the interpoſition of a legiſlature—what is not due to the proſecution of the means of preventing the miſeries inſeparably attendant on, and the cruelties and deplorable ſufferings too often annexed to, a ſtate of perpetual ſlavery; in which many thouſands of our fellow-creatures are, and may be unjuſtly detained?
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012701_0015_0F8C2DF450B02010"/>
Let us reconcile our practice to our avowed principles. Let not our profeſſions of an inviolable attachment to liberty, of late ſo frequently echoed from one end of the continent to the other, be contradicted by a practice as unjuſt as it is impolitick. Doctor Young is very ſevere where he ſays
"The world's all title page, there's no contents."
Let our conduct ſhew our title to an exception. Let us therefore immediately conſider, and adopt the moſt prudent meaſures for relieving thoſe oppreſſed people; and of enemies make them friends and uſeful members of ſociety, by confering on them ſuch privileges as will intereſt them in the general welfare.</p>
            <p>BEING ſenſible of my deficiency, I ſhould have been pleaſed, had the few hints I have preſumed to obtrude on the publick, employed a pen more equal to the importance of my ſubject. Conſcious, however, of my motive in giving them, I flatter myſelf they will meet from the candid, the reception which is due to a good intention. As a wellwiſher to the religious and civil intereſts of my country, I am willing to contribute my mite towards the removal of an evil, which I believe to be dangerous to both: and if any thoughts I have meant to expreſs, have the leaſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to effect it; I ſhall be indifferent whatever opinion is formed of the dreſs they appear in.</p>
