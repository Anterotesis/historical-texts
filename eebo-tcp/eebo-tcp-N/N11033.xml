            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>CAN you, my Lord, who ſerve deſpotic ends,</l>
               <l>Can you be "juſt to virtue and her friends?"</l>
               <l>To wanton murderers when did ſhe afford</l>
               <l>Protection yet, or alter a record?</l>
               <l>Say, does your callous ſoul receive no ſhock,</l>
               <l>When, conſcious, in the hall, you view the clock?</l>
               <l>Or can you fill profidious Scroges's place,</l>
               <l>Without a preſſage of your own diſgrace?</l>
               <l>Yes—Yes, to England's ſhame you're out of reach,</l>
               <l>And laugh at him who threatens to impeach.</l>
               <l>If Burke ſhould riſe, the farce no further goes;</l>
               <l>To one juſt aye, North brings ten impious no's.</l>
               <l>In youth, before diſſembling was your trade,</l>
               <l>To James libations on your knees you made:</l>
               <l>Not loyalty, but fear has ſheath'd your ſting;</l>
               <l>No Murray can be faithful to his King.</l>

From the black North in famiſh'd clans you ſwarm,</l>
               <l>And thawing, feel how Albion's ſun can warm;</l>
               <l>Your clime you change, your ſentiments retain;</l>
               <l>In Scotchmen treaſon is an innate ſtain;</l>
               <l>Like itch and ſcurvy in their blood it reigns;</l>
               <l>He who would cure it muſt exhauſt their veins.</l>
               <l>Once againſt rebels, 'twas your place to plead,</l>
               <l>Your mouth condemn'd, your ſoul approv'd the deed.</l>
               <l>Whilſt round your heart ſad diſappointment hung,</l>
               <l>Diſſimulation oil'd your treach'rous tongue.</l>
               <l>A Murray then (your brother too) was found</l>
               <l>In arms, in ſecret truſt, in duty bound,</l>
               <l>And principle (like yours) to aid a claim,</l>
               <l>Which you affected with a bluſh to name;</l>
               <l>A bluſh ill-acted;—to thy ghoſtly pale,</l>
               <l>(Index of guilt) ſoft nature lends no veil.</l>
               <l>No—we my lord diſdains to ſerve ends;</l>
               <l>She's "only juſt to virtue and her friends."</l>
               <l>On them ſhe ſmiles, on Chatham's cheek ſhe glows,</l>
               <l>When injur's children are aſſail'd like foes;</l>
               <l>When famine's call'd to aid the coward plan,</l>
               <l>And North compleats what Bute and you began.</l>
               <l>Periſh your names! your Thane in fear is fled,</l>
               <l>With ev'ry curſe but Scotland's on his head:</l>

               <l>Whilſt you, his faithful proxy ſpeaks his mind;</l>
               <l>And (to weak George from ſoothing flatt'ry dear)</l>
               <l>Pour your Laird's poiſon in the royal ear.</l>
               <l>Why do your treach'rous actions ſhun the light?</l>
               <l>Why do back-ſtairs feel Mansfield's ſteps at night?</l>
               <l>To George your councils and yourſelf convey,</l>
               <l>Fraught with infection, in the face of day.</l>

Let not the royal cloſet's whiſper ſcreen,</l>
               <l>Your glorious works; but let your light be ſeen.</l>
               <l>Conduct, avow, enforce your patriot plans,</l>
               <l>Nor truſt their merits to ſubaltern clans.</l>
               <l>Tho' Bure abſconds, yet aid your joint deſign,</l>
               <l>Yourſelf, my Lord; and help to ſpring the mine.</l>
               <l>Whilſt Grafton, Sandwich, Denbig, North ſtand forth,</l>
               <l>And to aſtoniſh'd ears proclaim their worth;</l>
               <l>Whilſt, with rank nonſenſe, Suffolk, Pomfret, dare,</l>
               <l>Without a bluſh, to make Plebeians ſtare;</l>
               <l>Why, when your ſov'reign's pleas'd by law to kill,</l>
               <l>Step not you forth to gild the deſp'rate pill?</l>
               <l>'Tis decent, ſure, ſo penſion'd, plac'd and brib'd,</l>
               <l>To recommend the doſe you have preſcrib'd,</l>

               <l>A check—in you a lurking traitor lives;</l>
               <l>The worſt of traitors—you have ſenſe to ſee</l>
               <l>Fair Freedom's charms, yet blaſt the ſoul that's free.</l>
               <l>Early and late, inceſſant in your pains,</l>
               <l>For brave America you forge vile chains.</l>
               <l>Yet meanly, in your houſe or court take root,</l>

               <l>This truth ſubdu'd your modeſt member Leigh.</l>

               <l>How well an Aſton wou'd ſupply his place!</l>
               <l>So repreſented, with ſuch leaders too,</l>

This war againſt ourſelves will ſoon be won,</l>
               <l>Odious America be ſoon undone.</l>
               <l>Remonſtrances are vain, Bute won't relax,</l>
               <l>But ſternly bids North lay another tax.</l>
               <l>The tax of death, by bayonet and ball;</l>
               <l>But famine is the hardeſt tax of all.</l>
               <l>From Scotland, could that thought derive its ſource?</l>
               <l>Where is ſharp famine felt with greater force?</l>
               <l>In all the horrors there the fiend's array'd;</l>
               <l>There her ſhrunk hand for ever chills the blade.</l>
               <l>There with lank ſides, the meagre cattle moan;</l>

               <l>Thus are you "juſt to virtue and her friends."</l>
