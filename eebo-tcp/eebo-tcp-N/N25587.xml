            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>
                  <hi>AMOS,</hi> III. 2.</bibl>
               <q>YOU ONLY HAVE I KNOWN OF ALL THE FAMILIES OF THE EARTH, THEREFORE I WILL PUNISH YOU FOR YOUR INIQUITIES.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE prophet was directed to ſpeak in the name of the Lord, to the children of Iſrael, —
<q>You only have I known, of all the families of the earth, therefore I will puniſh you for your iniquities.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IN as much as
<q>the things which were written aforetime were written for our learning,</q>
it may be a proper and uſeful exerciſe for us, on the preſent ſerious occaſion, to conſider ſome of the reaſons, why thoſe ſubjects of moral government, who have received particular favours, and have
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:033984_0003_0FF9EEFCB0917CA8"/>abuſed them, have been marked out, in divine providence, by particular puniſhments.</p>
            <p>GREAT caution however is to be uſed, in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up our judgment, with reſpect to individuals, or ſocieties of men, from the ſufferings of the preſent life.</p>
            <p>THE friends of Job, we find had embraced an opinion, at that age of the world, that the greateſt ſufferers, are the greateſt ſinners. This alſo was the opinion of the Jews, who ſuppoſed thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy perſons, who were deſtroyed by a tower in Siloam, which fell upon them, were the greateſt ſinners in Jeruſalem. But this opinion, however popular, was diſcountenanced and rejected by the great teacher of mankind. He exhorted all who heard him to repent, as they hoped to eſcape deſtruction.</p>
            <p>BUT while we uſe great caution, in making up our judgment with reſpect to individuals, or ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of men, from their circumſtances in the preſent <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, we have authority from the ſcriptures to ſay, that individuals, and nations of men, have been <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> on account of their virtues, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of their vices. While the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> world, is to be conſidered, as <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> government by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:033984_0004_0FF9C71A0A014398"/>of laws which he hath eſtabliſhed, ſo that in a general way, neither love or hatred can be known by the circumſtances of the children of men, it muſt be granted, that obedient ſubjects, have, in many inſtances, been encouraged by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, while obſtinate and rebellious ſinners, have been puniſhed for their crimes.</p>
            <p>HAVING made the foregoing obſervations, I will proceed to offer ſome reaſons <hi>why</hi> thoſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of moral government, who have received particular favours and have abuſed them, have been marked out in divine providence, by particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar puniſhments.</p>
            <p>AND Iſt. The honor of divine government may require, that ſingular puniſhments, under certain circumſtances, ſhould be inflicted, even in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life.</p>
            <p>ONE reaſon, and perhaps, the greateſt of all, why the children of Iſrael were delivered from the bondage of Egypt, with a high hand, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted through the ſea, and through the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with an out-ſtretched arm, was to ſhow the heathen nations, in a ſtrong and convincing light, that Jehovah is infinitely ſuperior to all who were called Gods, and that He alone is to be worſhipped.</p>
            <p>GOD knew Iſrael as his peculiar people. He declared himſelf, the God of Abraham, the God
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033984_0005_0FF9EF065B317CA0"/>of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob. Having made a ſolemn covenant with thoſe patriarchs and their children, and granted them many important fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; having revealed to them his will, and given them commandments and ordinances to obſerve, his honour, as the Governor of the world, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with their conduct.</p>
            <p>WHEN it was known among the heathen, that God ſent plagues on the Egyptians, becauſe their King refuſed to releaſe the ſeed of Jacob from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable ſervitude;—that he deſtroyed Pharaoh and his hoſt in the red ſea;—that he ſettled his redeemed people in a country which had been long promiſed them, and protected them when expoſed to the numerous and powerful enemies round about them, there were particular and very ſtrong reaſons why they ſhould be careful to obey all the commandments which the Lord their God had given them. When they diſcovered their ingratitude by forgetting their deliverer, and by practiſing thoſe things which had been ſtrictly forbidden, there were particular and ſtrong rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why they ſhould be puniſhed.</p>
            <p>THE prophets and miniſters of the moſt High, were careful to proclaim abroad, that God had choſen Iſrael to be his inheritance,—a people to ſhew forth his praiſe: and therefore when Iſrael
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:033984_0006_0FF9EF07E1BF5FB0"/>choſe to be the inheritance of others, and to ſhew forth the praiſe of ſtrange Gods, the honour of Jehovah required, that Iſrael ſhould be puniſhed. The ſin of forſaking the true God, and giving that worſhip to idols which is due to Jehovah, was a public ſin; it was therefore highly proper, that ſome puniſhments of a public nature ſhould be inflicted.</p>
            <p>THE propriety of inflicting particular puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the children of Iſrael, after they had abuſed the ſingular favours which had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon them, will farther appear, when we conſider they were threatened with diſtreſſing cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, in order to guard them againſt apoſtacy and rebellion.</p>
            <p>WITHOUT conſulting any other parts of the ſacred volume, the xxviiith chapter of the book of Deuteronomy will furniſh ſufficient evidence of the care which Jehovah exerciſed over the morals of his ancient covenant people, both by promiſing bleſſings to the obedient, and threatening puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, varying in degree, but dreadful in the end, on all ſuch as reſolved to do wickedly.</p>
            <p>WE go on to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">IIdly. ANOTHER reaſon why ſingular puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are inflicted on ſuch members of God's
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033984_0007_0FF9EF0FACD98970"/>moral government, as have received particular favours and have abuſed them, may be to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the reformation and real good of tranſgreſſors themſelves.</p>
            <p>IN order to qualify imperfect creatures for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement in happineſs, it ſeems neceſſary, that in ſome ſtage of their exiſtence, they ſhould be ſubjected to a courſe of trial and diſcipline.— Nor are we to ſuppoſe it hath been the peculiarly hard lot of mankind to be placed under ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. Beings ſuperior to us have been tried. What were the particular circumſtances of trial to which the angels were ſubjected we know not. We know, from the ſacred books, a number of them fell from their firſt eſtate—
<q>left their own habitation, and are reſerved in ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting chains, under darkneſs, unto the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great day.</q>
            </p>
            <p>OUR parents, made in the image of God, and free from ſin, were tried and fell. We all have our trials. We are all in a ſtate of diſcipline. Some of the children of men have greater trials than others. It hath ſo happened, that ſome who were under the moſt favourable diſcipline, and poſſeſſed the higheſt advantages for moral and religious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, have been overcome in the day of trial,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033984_0008_0FF9EF15D008C450"/>and have wandered in the way of ſin. In mercy to ſuch perſons God hath corrected them. By ſufferings he hath taught them the evil of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. To this point we have the teſtimony of David, a man, in many reſpects, highly favoured, but extremely irregular in his conduct.
<q>Before I was afflicted,
ſays, he,
I went aſtray: but now have I kept thy word.</q>
Like good effects of affliction have been experienced by ſerious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in all ages.</p>
            <p>SUCH are the imperfections of human nature, and of the preſent life, that ſmall has been the number of thoſe who have maintained purity of moral cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and a truly devotional ſpirit, during a courſe of uninterrupted proſperity, and worldly enjoyment. When <hi>Agur</hi> prayed that he might poſſeſs medio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity of circumſtances, he knew that uninterrupted proſperity very often draws off the heart from God.
<q>Give me neither poverty nor riches: feed me with food convenient for me, leſt I be full and deny thee, and ſay, who is the Lord?</q>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN people are drawn away from a ſenſe of dependance of God, and from the path of duty, by their ſucceſſes, and by the abundance which they poſſeſs, afflictions and diſappointments, may do them good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:033984_0009_0FF9C72E24052930"/>IN the courſe of diſcipline in which we are pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, we either improve in virtue and knowledge, or we degenerate: The means which are uſed with us in providence, will either have a good effect, or leave us leſs ſuſceptible of good impreſſions.</p>
            <p>THERE are thoſe, who by the bounties of heaven, are filled with gratitude: who ſtudy to know what returns they ſhall make for divine favours: who endeavour to honour God, and to make their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures happy, in the uſe which they make of their ſubſtance. Such men are good ſtewards: they feel the pleaſure of doing good, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward will be great in Heaven.</p>
            <p>OTHERS there are, who are proud of what they poſſeſs. Proſperity makes them vain and ſelfiſh. When they ought to be more pious, they are more irreligious: When they have more power to do good, they have leſs of the diſpoſition. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the ſolicitations of the poor and needy, that they may have the more to conſume in the gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of their appetites and paſſions.</p>
            <p>WHEN men who were once ſober and virtuous, who in moderate circumſtances, attended to the duties of religion, and felt the ſufferings of the needy and afflicted, loſe their good impreſſions;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033984_0010_0FF9EF244298AC40"/>and in more elevated circumſtances, ſhow that they regard nothing but their own pleaſures, it may be a mercy to correct them. When they ſhow that they cannot bear ſucceſs, but the more they have, the more they increaſe in pride and folly, it may be a mercy to ſtrip them of their ſubſtance, and humble them by loſſes and ſufferings.</p>
            <p>THAT the purpoſes of God are kind and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent, in the ſufferings which he brings on the children of men, we are clearly taught in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred writings. He does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men. If need be we are in heavineſs. The fruit of affliction is to take away ſin.</p>
            <p>WE add once more,</p>
            <p n="3">IIIdly. GOD may inflict particular puniſhments on ſuch members of his moral government, as have received particular favours, and have abuſed them, in order to afford ſuitable warning to others.</p>
            <p>ONE important end for which the judgments of Heaven fell upon the diſobedient children of Iſrael, was the conviction which their ſufferings afforded, even to the heathen nations, that the ways of God are right; and that he will not ſuffer the workers of iniquity to eſcape the effects of his diſpleaſure.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033984_0011_0FF9C743C17B6CD0"/>Thus we read, in the xxxixth of Ezekiel:
<q>The heathen ſhall know that the houſe of Iſrael went into captivity for <hi>their iniquities</hi>:—becauſe they tranſgreſſed againſt me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the hand of their enemies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>MORE ſolemn warnings cannot be given to the wicked children of men, than thoſe which were given to the children of Iſrael, both by the words which were ſpoken to them, and by the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which in the courſe of divine providence, were inflicted upon them.</p>
            <p>THEY were the peculiar people of the moſt High. God choſe them from the nations of the earth, that by them his name might be known, and that they might ſhew forth his praiſe. He delivered them from the bondage of Egypt: He protected them when expoſed to their enemies: He fed them with bread from Heaven: He eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed with them his covenant: He gave them particular inſtructions with reſpect to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct: He promiſed them the higheſt temporal felicity as the reward of obedience, and threatened them with extreme wretchedneſs, in caſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected his law, and choſe to rebel againſt him.</p>

            <p>THE judgments of Heaven, which were inflicted on the whole family of the children of Iſrael, ſtand as ſolemn warnings to all who live in wickedneſs: If God ſpared not the ſeed of Abraham his friend, but accompliſhed the things which he threatened, when they rebelled againſt him, no other nation ſurely can expect to be treated with more tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>TO anſwer valuable purpoſes in the moral go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the world, certain periods are marked with the record of awful judgments, which God hath ſeen fit to inflict on the children of men.</p>

            <p>IN the year of our Lord 542, a peſtilential diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order appeared firſt in Egypt, on the eaſtern chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of the Nile,
<q>from thence, tracing as it were a double path, it ſpread to the Eaſt, over Syria, Perſia, and the Indies; and penetrated to the Weſt along the coaſt of Africa, and over the continent of Europe.</q>
This Plague, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt general on the annals of the world, continued fifty-two years:—Its progreſs was eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where marked, with deſolation and ruin.

<q>no facts have been preſerved to ſuſtain an account, or even a conjecture, of the numbers that periſhed in this extraordinary mortality.</q>
               <q>Many cities of the Eaſt were left vacant: the decreaſe of the human ſpecies, during that ſeaſon of affliction, has never been repaired in ſome of the faireſt countries of the globe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>FROM 1346 to 1350, the principal countries of the world were again viſited with an extenſive Plague. It broke out in <hi>China</hi> in 1346, and paſſed into the <hi>Eaſt-Indies, Syria, Turkey, Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE next year it raged on the other ſide of the Mediterranean. In 1348, and 1349, it raged in Hungary, in Germany, in Spain, in France, in Belgium and Denmark, in England, Scotland and Ireland.<note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>MANY pages of hiſtory are filled with accounts of peſtilential diſeaſes which have thinned off the inhabitants of the world. At ſome periods the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033984_0017_0FF9C78F64526A88"/>evil has been general, and at other times it has been confined to particular places.</p>
            <p>IN 1656 the Plague was brought from Sardinia to Naples. It raged with exceſſive violence, and in leſs than ſix months carried off 400,000 of the inhabitants.</p>
            <p>IN the latter end of 1664 ſeveral perſons died of a peſtilential diſorder at Weſtminſter, and in the ſpring after, London was viſited with a dreadful Plague. In the months of Auguſt and September, the mortality was diſtreſſing beyond what had been known in that city before.</p>
            <p>
               <q>ABOUT the beginning of September the diſeaſe was at the height.</q>
Eight, and ten thouſand, and even "twelve thouſand died in a week."</p>

            <p>WHEN we conſider the manner in which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Earth have been chaſtiſed at one time and another, what reaſon can be offered why we, on this quarter of the globe, ſhould hope to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033984_0018_0FF9EF58FA735160"/>eſcape? Countries to all appearance as favourably ſituated for health, as the American States, have been ſcourged by the peſtilence, and conſumed by the judgments of Heaven.</p>
            <p>LET us now apply the ſubject, and endeavour to have our hearts impreſſed with the thoughts which have been ſuggeſted.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH we can claim no particular relation to the God of Heaven, in conſequence of a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with our Fathers, like that which was made with the Hebrew Patriarchs, we may gain important inſtruction from their hiſtory.</p>
            <p>WHILE it is not pretended that the firſt Engliſh planters of this country were protected by mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous interpoſitions of providence, it will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged their enterpriſe was aſtoniſhingly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. A ſmall number were protected among ſavages in an inhoſpitable wilderneſs, three thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and miles from their native country. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and multiplied, their poſterity are now a powerful and numerous people.</p>
            <p>THE inhabitants of no part of the earth have poſſeſſed, or do poſſeſs the means of happineſs to higher perfection, than the inhabitants of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican States have poſſeſſed, and do generally poſſeſs, at this very day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:033984_0019_0FF9C7557B602260"/>WE have, and we do enjoy all the civil and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious advantages which reaſonable creatures, while in the preſent life, have any right to expect. The inhabitants of our country have enjoyed, and (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in ſome of the ſea-ports, and great towns) do now enjoy as much health as the inhabitants of moſt other countries have enjoyed.—And what have been the effects of divine goodneſs? What fruit have we brought forth? Have we expreſſed that gratitude to a heavenly benefactor,—that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment with our portion in life, which we ought to have expreſſed? And further let me inquire, What is the ſtate of Religion? We bluſh to ſay.—We are obliged to confeſs, that while iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has abounded, the love of many has waxed cold. The friends of God and of Religion, may adopt the words of Jeremiah, with little variation and ſay,
<q>The ways of Zion mourn, becauſe <hi>few</hi> come to the ſolemn feaſts.</q>
Never was there a time, when ſacred things were treated with more neglect. Multitudes ſpeak of Religion as a thing of no conſequence; while many treat its inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with contempt.</p>
            <p>IF our fathers were too ſtrict in the obſervance of the Chriſtian Sabbath, and the rites of religion, the preſent generation has certainly gone very far to the other extreme.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:033984_0020_0FF9EF65439534B0"/>THE indifferency—the luke-warmneſs of many who have profeſſed a general friendſhip for the Chriſtian Religion, has, we fear, encouraged its open enemies to blaſpheme the name by which we are called; and inſult the authority of God.—</p>
            <p>THE prophet was ordered to ſay, unto the whole family of the children of Iſrael,
<q>You only have I known, of all the families of the earth; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will puniſh you for your iniquities.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As the inhabitants of this land have been, and are now in poſſeſſion of many advantages which they have not duly eſteemed,—ſome of the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of which they have neglected or abuſed, there is reaſon to fear God will viſit them with his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and make them know, as he did his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in ancient times, what an evil thing it is to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe his goodneſs, and trample on his laws. This to be ſure, is not a comfortable thought: but if paſt diſpenſations of providence, excite ſuch fears and apprehenſions, we ſhould be unwiſe to put them from us, however unpleaſant.</p>
            <p>THE judgments of God are now abroad in the earth, and ſome of them have already fallen upon the American States.</p>
            <p>WHILE the moſt powerful nations of Europe are ſuffering the horrors of war, and are made the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033984_0021_0FF9EF8454400178"/>in providence of chaſtiſing each other, the inhabitants of the principal Cities and Towns on this Continent are afflicted, and many are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by a peſtilential Epidemic.</p>
            <p>THE Capitol of the United States, which a few weeks ago, was full of people,—the ſeat of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,—the reſort of ſtrangers who viſit our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,—the abode of the induſtrious and of the rich, is now a city, almoſt left ſolitary.</p>
            <p>THY Peſtilence hath marked its way, with awful deſtruction: many have fallen before it. To eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape its malignant breath, multitudes have fled. Men, women and children to the number of fifty thouſand, it is ſaid, have left their houſes and their occupations, and ſought protection in towns and villages where they had reaſon to hope, there was no infection. It is not poſſible for us to conceive of their afflictions and ſufferings. We pray God to remove the ſtroke of his hand: to have compaſſion on his people: to heal and comfort them.</p>
            <p>NOR is Philadelphia the only City which is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed with the peſtilential diſorder, which has put on ſo threatening an appearance in our country.

            <p>With the hope of doing good, a few thoughts are offered on the cauſes of Contagion, and Peſtilential Diſeaſes, and the means of guarding againſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <q>CONTAGION is propagated by three cauſes, The air, diſeaſed perſons, and goods tranſported from infected places.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Richard Mead,</note>
            </p>
            <p>IT is the firſt cauſe, which at the preſent time, engages our particular attention. As we have no reaſon to ſuppoſe the ſeeds of the Epidemic, which has given us ſo much diſtreſs, were imported, it is generally agreed, the cauſe is in the air.</p>
            <p>WE are therefore naturally led to inquire, what is there in the air we breathe, which may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the cauſe of contagion and peſtilential diſeaſe?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ii" facs="unknown:033984_0025_0FF9EFE70664C3B8"/>THE reſearches of the philoſophers and chemiſts of the preſent age, will help us, perhaps, to an anſwer.</p>
            <p>NEARLY three quarters of
<q>the elaſtic fluids which compoſe the inferior ſtratum of air which we inhabit,</q>

               </note> are noxious, &amp; incapable of ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life. It is by the preſence of the other quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that health and life are preſerved.</p>
            <p>THE vital, or life-ſupporting part of the air, in the modern language of chemiſts, is called <hi>oxygen</hi>: the other parts, <hi>azote.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>azote,</hi> or "mephitic part of atmoſpheric air," conſiſts of vapours from mud, marſhes, ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant waters, fermenting and putrefying ſubſtances of all kinds; together with the air which has ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the deſtruction of its <hi>vital</hi> part by paſſing the lungs of all the living creatures, and by ſupporting all the fires which are burning in all parts of the world.</p>
            <p>A <hi>redundancy</hi> of the non-reſpirable part of air now mentioned, may be a cauſe ſufficient to produce peſtilential diſorders of the worſt kind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="unknown:033984_0026_0FF9C78DDF1B7C58"/>LONG continued <hi>heat</hi> without winds and ſtorms, will produce ſuch a redundancy. Long continued heat will not only produce noxious vapours, but by rarefying the atmoſphere near the earth, it will ſo leſſen the preſſure, as to ſuffer thoſe vapours to riſe high enough to be received into our lungs—ſome of thoſe vapours are ſo much heavier than the common air, in a temperate ſtate of the atmoſphere, as to creep along juſt above the ſurface of the earth, and ſettle down in vallies and low grounds. In the <hi>Grotto del Cano,</hi> the noxious air will kill the dog, who carries his noſe near the ground, while a man, erect, receives no injury.</p>
            <p>BUT if the cauſe of the moſt fatal peſtilential diſeaſes is to be found in the air, how ſhall we guard againſt them? We cannot prevent the heat. We have no command over the winds. The changes of the weather are, in no degree under our controul.—We can however remove many of thoſe ſubſtances, which in hot weather, ſend forth poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous <hi>effluvia.</hi> We can keep our ſtreets clean. We can fill up or cleanſe thoſe <hi>docks</hi> and <hi>ſlips</hi> which <hi>receive,</hi> and which <hi>expoſe</hi> the moſt filthy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, when the water retires. We can bury, or ſink in the ſea, thoſe things which would offend and injure us, if left above ground.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:033984_0027_0FF9EFF8DCC95E98"/>WE can, from exhauſtleſs ſprings on our own peninſula, or from fountains in the vicinity, we can, every day, through the ſummer, ſend refreſhing ſtreams, from elevated ſituations to all the lower parts of the town.</p>
            <p>WE can plant trees on every vacant ſpot, which will repay us, not only by their beautiful appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but by drinking up the <hi>azotic gas,</hi> and breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from their leaves, the pureſt air.</p>
            <p>WE can keep ourſelves clean: We can keep our houſes, and particularly our <hi>lodging-chambers</hi> clean: We can refrain from full meals of animal food, and from inebriating liquors: We can do many things to guard againſt contagious and peſtilential diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes: And when we have done all in our power, we may truſt the providence of God, with an eaſy mind.</p>
