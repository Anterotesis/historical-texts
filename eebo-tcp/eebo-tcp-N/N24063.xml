         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the multiplicity of School-Books now in uſe, it has been often ſuggeſted, that a Selection, calculated particularly for Dialogue and Declamation, would be of extenſive utility in our ſeminaries.</p>
            <p>The art of Oratory needs no encomium. To cultivate its rudiments, and diffuſe its ſpirit among the Youth of America, is the deſign of this Book.</p>
            <p>Of the many pieces which this volume contains, three only are to be found in any publication of the kind. A large proportion is entirely original. For aſſiſtance in this part, the Author acknowledges himſelf indebted to ſeveral friends, whoſe names he is not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized to divulge.</p>
            <p>The <hi>COLUMBIAN ORATOR</hi> is deſigned for a Second Part to the <hi>AMERICAN PRECEPTOR</hi>; for this reaſon, no pieces are inſerted from that book.</p>
            <p>As no advantage could ariſe from a methodical ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement, the Author has preferred variety to ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. In his choice of materials, it has been his object to ſelect ſuch as ſhould inſpire the pupil with the <hi>ardor of eloquence,</hi> and the <hi>love of virtue.</hi> He has ſpared no pains to render the Work, in every reſpect, worthy of the generous patronage, which a liberal public have beſtowed on his former publications.</p>

                  <p>THE beſt judges among the ancients have repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented Pronunciation, which they likewiſe called Action, as the principal part of an orator's province; from whence he is chiefly to expect ſucceſs in the art of perſuaſion. When Cicero, in the perſon of Craſſus, has largely and elegantly diſcourſed upon all the other parts of oratory, coming at laſt to ſpeak of thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> he ſays, "All the former have their effect as they are pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. It is the action alone which governs in ſpeaking; without which the beſt orator is of no value; and is often defeated by one, in other reſpects, much his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior." And he lets us know, that Demoſthenes was of the ſame opinion; who, when he was aſked <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                     <pb n="8" facs="unknown:031827_0006_0FEEC2BDA773E250"/>And, indeed, if he had not judged this highly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for an orator, he would ſcarcely have taken ſo much pains in correcting thoſe natural defects, under which he labored at firſt, in order to acquire it. For he had both a weak voice, and likewiſe an impediment in his ſpeech, ſo that he could not pronounce diſtinctly ſome particular letters. The former of which defects he conquered, partly by ſpeaking as loud as he could upon the ſhore, when the ſea roared and was boiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and partly, by pronouncing long periods as he walked up hill; both of which methods contributed to ſtrengthen his voice. And he found means to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his pronunciation more clear and articulate, by the help of ſome little ſtones put under his tongue. Nor was he leſs careful in endeavoring to gain the habit of a becoming and decent geſture; for which purpoſe he uſed to pronounce his diſcourſes alone before a large glaſs. And becauſe he had an ill cuſtom of drawing up his ſhoulders when he ſpoke, to amend that, he uſed to place them under a ſword, which hung over him with the point downward.</p>
                  <p>Such pains did this prince of the Grecian orators take to remove thoſe difficulties, which would have been ſufficient to diſcourage an inferior, and leſs aſpiring genius. And to how great a perfection he arrived in his action, under all theſe diſadvantages, by his inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable diligence and application, is evident from the confeſſion of his great adverſary and rival in oratory, Eſchines; who, when he could not bear the diſgrace of being wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And being deſired by the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants, he recited to them his own oration upon that occaſion; the next day they requeſted of him to let them hear that of Demoſthenes; which, having pronounced in a moſt graceful manner, to the admiration of all who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

what our compoſitions are, as how they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced; ſince it is the manner of the delivery, by which the audience is moved."</p>
                  <p>The truth of this ſentiment of the ancients concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the power and efficacy of pronunciation, might be proved from many inſtances; but one or two may here ſuffice. Hortenſius, a cotemporary with Cicero, and while living, next to him in reputation as an orator, was highly applauded for his action. But his orations after his death, as Quintilian tells us, did not appear anſwerable to his character; from whence he juſtly concludes, there muſt have been ſomething pleaſing when he ſpoke, by which he gained his character, which was loſt in reading them.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps there is ſcarcely a more conſiderable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this than in Cicero himſelf. After the death of Pompey, when Ceſar had gotten the government into his own hands, many of his acquaintance interce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with him in behalf of their relations and friends, who had been of the contrary party in the late wars. Among others, Cicero ſolicited for his friend Ligarius; which, Tubero underſtanding, who owed Ligarius a grudge, opp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſed; and undertook to repreſent him to Ceſar as unworthy of his mercy. Ceſar himſelf was prejudiced againſt Ligarius; and therefore, when the cauſe was to come before him, he ſaid, "We may venture to hear Cicero diſplay his eloquence; for I know the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rſon he pleads for to be an ill man, and my enemy."</p>
                  <p>But, however, in the courſe of his oration, Cicero ſo wrought upon his paſſions, that by the frequent altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his countenance, the emotions of his mind were very conſpicuous. And when he came to touch upon the battle of Pharſalia, which had given Ceſar the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of the world, he repreſented it in ſuch a moving and lively manner, that Ceſar could no longer contain himſelf, but was thrown into ſuch a fit of ſhivering, that he dropped the papers which he held in his hand. This was the more remarkable, becauſe Ceſar was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031827_0008_0FEEC2C49CA02BB8"/>
one of the greateſt orators of that age; knew all the arts of addreſs, and avenues to the paſſions; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently was better prepared to guard againſt them.</p>
                  <p>But neither his ſkill, nor reſolution of mind, was of ſufficient force againſt the power of oratory; but the conqueror of the world became a conqueſt to the charms of Cicero's eloquence; ſo that, contrary to his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he pardoned Ligarius. Now that oration is ſtill extant, and appears exceedingly well calculated to touch the ſoft and tender paſſions and ſprings of the ſoul; but we believe it can ſcarcely be diſcernible to any, in reading it, how it ſhould have had ſo ſurpriſing an effect; which muſt therefore have been chiefly ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the wonderful addreſs of the ſpeaker.</p>
                  <p>The more natural the pronunciation is, the more moving it will be; ſince the perfection of art conſiſts in its neareſt reſemblance to nature. And therefore it is not without good reaſon, that the ancients make it one qualification of an orator, that he be a <hi>good</hi> man; becauſe a perſon of this character will make the cauſe he eſpouſes his own; and the more ſenſibly he is touched with it himſelf, the more natural will be his action; and, of courſe, the more eaſily will he affect others. Cicero ſays, "It is certain that truth (by which he means nature) in every thing excels imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but if that were ſufficient of itſelf in action, we ſhould have no occaſion for art."</p>
                  <p>In his opinion therefore (and who was ever a better judge?) art, in this caſe, as well as in many others, if well managed, will aſſiſt and improve nature. But this is not all; for ſometimes we find the force of it ſo great and powerful, that, where it is wholly counterfeit, it will for the time work the ſame effect as if it were founded in truth. This is well known to thoſe who have been converſant with the repreſentations of the theatre. In tragedies, though we are ſenſible that ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery thing we ſee and hear is counterfeit; yet ſuch is the power of action, that we are oftentimes affected by it in the ſame manner as if it were all reality.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="unknown:031827_0009_0FEEC2C8C9375C18"/>Anger and reſentment at the appearance of cruelty, concern and ſolicitude for diſtreſſed virtue, riſe in our breaſts; and tears are extorted from us for oppreſſed innocence: though at the ſame time, perhaps, we are ready to laugh at ourſelves for being thus decoyed. If art then has ſo great an influence upon us, when ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by fancy and imagination only, how powerful muſt be the effect of a juſt and lively repreſentation of what we know to be true.</p>
                  <p>How agreeable it is, both to nature and reaſon, that a warmth of expreſſion and vehemency of motion ſhould riſe in proportion to the importance of the ſubject and concern of the ſpeaker, will further appear by looking back a little into the more early and ſimple ages of the world For the higher we go, the more we ſhall find of both. The Romans had a very great talent this way, and the Greeks a greater. The eaſtern nations excelled in it, and particularly the Hebrews.</p>
                  <p>Nothing can equal the ſtrength and vivacity of the figures they employed in their diſcourſe, and the very actions they uſed, to expreſs their ſentiments; ſuch as putting aſhes on their heads, and tearing their garments, and covering themſelves with ſackcloth under any deep diſtreſs and ſorrow of mind. And hence, no doubt, aroſe thoſe ſurpriſing effects of eloquence, which we never experience now.</p>
                  <p>And what is ſaid here, with reſpect to the action of the eaſtern nations, was in a good meaſure cuſtomary among the Greeks and Romans; if not entirely of the ſame kind, yet perhaps as vehement and expreſſive. They did not think language of itſelf ſufficient to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the height of their paſſions, unleſs enforced by uncommon motions and geſtures. Thus, when Achil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les had driven the Trojans into their city with the greateſt precipitation and terror, and only Hector ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ernation for the danger of their ſon. And therefore, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> order to prevail with him to come into the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031827_0010_0FEEC2CA5073EA00"/>
city and not fight with Achilles, they not only entreat him from the walls in the moſt tender and moving lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage imaginable; but they tear off their grey locks with their hands, and adjure him to comply with their requeſt.</p>
                  <p>The poet knew very well, that no words of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves could repreſent thoſe agonies of mind he endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ored to convey, unleſs heightened by the idea of ſuch actions as were expreſſive of the deepeſt ſorrow. In one of Cicero's orations, he does not ſtick to argue in this manner with his adverſary. "Would you talk thus (ſays he) if you were ſerious? Would you, who are wont to diſplay your eloquence ſo warmly in the danger of others, act ſo coldly in your own? Where is that concern, that ardor, which uſed to extort pity even from children? Here is no emotion either of mind or body; neither the forehead ſtruck, nor the thigh; nor ſo much as a ſtamp of the foot. Therefore, you have been ſo far from inflaming our minds, that you have ſcarcely kept us awake."</p>
                  <p>The ancients had perſons, whoſe proper buſineſs it was to teach them how to regulate and manage their voice; and others, who inſtructed them in the whole art of pronunciation, both as to their voice and geſtures. Theſe latter were generally taken from the theatre, being ſome eminent experienced actors. But though they made uſe of actors to inſtruct their youth in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſpeech and geſtures; yet the action of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator was very different from that of the theatre.</p>
                  <p>Cicero very plainly repreſents this diſtinction, in the words of Craſſus; when ſpeaking of orators, he ſays, "The motions of the body ought to be ſuited to the expreſſions, not in a theatrical way, mimicking the words by particular geſticulations; but in a manner expreſſive of the general ſenſe; with a ſedate and manly inflection of the ſides; not taken from the ſtage and actors, but from the exerciſe of arms and the paleſtra." And Quintilian ſays to the ſame purpoſe, "Every geſture and motion of the comedians is not to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031827_0011_0FEEC2CE5FF2BDD0"/>
nor to the ſame degree." They thought the action of the theatre too light and extravagant for the imitation of an orator; and therefore, though they employed actors to inform young perſons in the firſt rudiments, yet they were afterwards ſent to ſchools, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned on purpoſe to teach them a decent and graceful management of their bodies.</p>
                  <p>Being thus far prepared, they were afterwards ſent to the ſchools of the rhetoricians. And here, as their buſineſs was to cultivate their ſtyle, and gain the whole art of eloquence, ſo particularly to acquire a juſt and accurate pronunciation by thoſe exerciſes, in which for that end they were conſtantly employed. Nor, after all this pains and induſtry, did they yet think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſufficiently qualified to take upon them the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of orators. But it was their conſtant cuſtom to get together ſome of their friends and acquaintance, who were proper judges of ſuch performances, and declaim before them in private.</p>
                  <p>The buſineſs of theſe perſons was to make obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both on their language and pronunciation. And they were allowed the greateſt freedom to take notice of any thing thought to be amiſs, either as to inaccuracy of method, impropriety of ſtyle, or indecency of their voice or actions. This gave them an opportunity to correct any ſuch defects at firſt, before they became habitual. What effects might not juſtly be expected from ſuch an inſtitution? Perſons trained up in this manner, with all thoſe advantages, joined to a good natural genius, could not fail of making very complete orators. Though even after they came to appear in public, they did not lay aſide the cuſtom of declaiming.</p>
                  <p>The influence of ſounds, either to raiſe or allay our paſſions, is evident from muſic. And certainly the harmony of a fine diſcourſe, well and gracefully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, is as capable of moving us, if not in a way ſo violent and ecſtatic, yet not leſs powerful, and more agreeable to our rational faculties. As perſons are dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently affected when they ſpeak, ſo they naturally
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031827_0012_0FEEC2CFE7C05C70"/>
alter the tone of their voice, though they do not attend to it. It riſes, ſinks, and has various inflections given it, according to the preſent ſtate and diſpoſition of the mind. When the mind is calm and ſedate, the voice is moderate and even; when the former is dejected with ſorrow, the latter is languid; and when that is inflamed by paſſion, this is elevated.</p>
                  <p>It is the orator's buſineſs, therefore, to follow nature, and to endeavor that the tone of his voice appear natural and unaffected. And for this end, he muſt take care to ſuit it to the nature of the ſubject; but ſtill ſo as to be always grave and decent. Some perſons continue a diſcourſe in ſuch a low and drawling manner, that they can ſcarcely be heard by their audience. Others again hurry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in ſo loud and boiſterous a manner as if they imagined their hearers were deaf. But all the muſic and harmony of voice lies between theſe extremes.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps nothing is of more importance to a ſpeaker, than a proper attention to accent, emphaſis, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Every word in our language, of more than one ſyllable, has, at leaſt, one accented ſyllable. This ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ought to be rightly known, and the word ſhould be pronounced by the ſpeaker in the ſame manner as he would pronounce it in ordinary converſation. By em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis, we diſtinguiſh thoſe words in a ſentence which we eſteem the moſt important, by laying a greater ſtreſs of voice upon them than we do upon the others. And it is ſurpriſing to obſerve how the ſenſe of a phraſe may be altered by varying the emphaſis. The following example will ſerve as an illuſtration.</p>
                  <p>This ſhort queſtion, "Will you ride to town to-day?" may be underſtood in four different ways, and, conſequently, may receive four different anſwers, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the placing of the emphaſis.</p>
                  <p>If it be pronounced thus; Will <hi>you</hi> ride to town to-day? the anſwer may properly be, No; I ſhall ſend my ſon. If thus; Will you <hi>rid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                     </hi> to town to-day? Anſwer, No; I intend to walk. Will you ride to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031827_0013_0FEEC2D16F3C8F50"/>
                     <hi>town</hi> to-day? No; I ſhall ride into the country. Will you ride to town <hi>to-day?</hi> No; but I ſhall to-morrow.</p>
                  <p>This ſhows how neceſſary it is that a ſpeaker ſhould know where to place his emphaſis. And the only rule for this is, that he ſtudy to attain a juſt conception of the force and ſpirit of the ſentiments which he delivers. There is as great a difference between one who lays his emphaſis properly, and one who pays no regard to it, or places it wrong, as there is between one who plays on an inſtrument with a maſterly hand, and the moſt bungling performer.</p>
                  <p>Cadence is the reverſe of emphaſis. It is a depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or lowering of the voice; and commonly falls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the laſt ſyllable in a ſentence. It is varied, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, according to the ſenſe. When a queſtion is aſked, it ſeldom falls upon the laſt word; and many ſentences require no cadence at all.</p>
                  <p>Every perſon, who ſpeaks in public, ſhould endeavor, if he can, to f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ll the place where he ſpeaks. But ſtill he ought to be careful not to exceed the natural key of his voice. If he does, it will neither be ſoft nor agreeable; but either harſh and rough, or too ſhrill and ſqueaking. Beſides, he will not be able to give every ſyllable its full and diſtinct ſound; which will render what he ſays obſcure, and difficult to be underſtood. He ſhould therefore take care to keep his voice within reach, ſo as to have it under management, that he may raiſe or ſink it, or give it any inflection he thinks prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; which it will not be in his power to do, if he put a force upon it, and ſtrain it beyond its natural tone.</p>
                  <p>The like caution is to be uſed againſt the contrary extreme, that the voice be not ſuffered to ſink too low. This will give the ſpeaker pain in raiſing it again to its proper pitch, and be no leſs offenſive to the hearers. The medium between theſe two is a moderate and even voice. But this is not the ſame in all; that which is moderate in one would be high in another. Every perſon therefore muſt regulate it by the natural key of his own voice. A calm and ſedate voice is generally
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031827_0014_0FEEC2D750A15EB8"/>
beſt; as a moderate ſound is moſt pleaſing to the ear, if it be clear and diſtinct. But this equality of the voice muſt alſo be accompanied with a variety; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe there can be no harmony; ſince all harmony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in variety.</p>
                  <p>Nothing is leſs pleaſing than a diſcourſe pronounced throughout in one continued tone of the voice, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any alteration. The equality, therefore, we are here ſpeaking of, admits a variety of inflections and changes within the ſame pitch. And when that is altered, the gradations, whether higher or lower, ſhould be ſo gentle and regular as to preſerve a due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the parts, and harmony of the whole; which cannot be done, when the voice is ſuddenly varied with too great a diſtinction. And therefore it ſhould move from one key to another, ſo as rather to glide like a gentle ſtream, than pour down like a rapid torrent, as an ingenious writer has well expreſſed it.</p>
                  <p>But an affected variety, ill placed, is as diſagreeable to a judicious audience, as the want of it, where the ſubject requires it. We may find ſome perſons, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing a grave and plain diſcourſe, affect as many different tones, and variations of their voice, as if they were acting a comedy; which is doubtleſs a very great impropriety. But the orator's province is not barely to apply to the mind, but likewiſe to the paſſions; which require a great variety of the voice, high or low, vehement or languid, according to the nature of the paſſions he deſigns to affect. So that for an orator always to uſe the ſame tone or degree of his voice, and expect to anſwer all his views by it, would be much the ſame thing as if a phyſician ſhould propoſe to cure all diſtempers by one medicine. And, as a perfect monoto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is always unpleaſant, ſo it can never be neceſſary in any diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>That ſome ſentences ought to be pronounced faſter than others is very manifeſt. Gay and ſprightly ideas ſhould not only be expreſſed louder, but alſo quicker than ſuch as are melancholy. And when we preſs an
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031827_0015_0FEEC2DA184C3AE8"/>
opponent, the voice ſhould be briſk. But to hurry on in a precipitant manner without pauſing, till ſtopped for want of breath, is certainly a very great fault. This deſtroys not only the neceſſary diſtinction between ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and ſentence, but likewiſe between the ſeveral words of the ſame ſentence; by which mean, all the grace of ſpeaking is loſt, and in a great meaſure, the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of hearing.</p>
                  <p>Young perſons are very liable to this, eſpecially at firſt ſetting out. And it often ariſes from diffidence. They are jealous of their performances, and the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs they may have in ſpeaking, which gives them a pain till it is over; and this puts them into a hurry of mind, which incapacitates them from governing their voice, and keeping it under that due regulation which perhaps they propoſed to themſelves before they began to ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>And as a precipitant and haſty pronunciation is cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, ſo likewiſe on the other hand, it is a fault to ſpeak too ſlow. This ſeems to argue a heavineſs in the ſpeaker. And as he appears cool himſelf, he can never expect to warm his hearers, and excite their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. When not only every word, but every ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable is drawn out to too great a length, the ideas do not come faſt enough to keep up the attention without much uneaſineſs. Now, to avoid either of the two extremes laſt mentioned, the voice ought to be ſedate and diſtinct. And in order to render it diſtinct, it is neceſſary, not only that each word and ſyllable ſhould have its juſt and full ſound, both as to time and accent; but likewiſe that every ſentence, and part of a ſentence, ſhould be ſeparated by its proper pauſe.</p>
                  <p>This is more eaſy to be done in reading, from the aſſiſtance of the points; but it is no leſs to be attended to in ſpeaking, if we would pronounce in a diſtinct and graceful manner. For every one ſhould ſpeak in the ſame manner as he ought to read, if he could ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at that exactneſs. Now the common rule given in pauſing is, that we ſtop our voice at a comma till we
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031827_0016_0FEEC2DB9F691788"/>
can tell one, at a ſemicolon two, at a colon three, and at a full period four. And as theſe points are either accommodated to the ſeveral parts of the ſame ſentence, as the firſt three; or different ſentences, as the laſt; this occaſions the different length of the pauſe, by which either the dependence of what precedes upon that which follows, or its diſtinction from it is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.</p>
                  <p>It is not in our power to give ourſelves what qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities of the voice we pleaſe; but only to make the beſt uſe we can of what nature has beſtowed upon us. However, ſeveral defects of the voice are capable of being helped by care and proper means; as, on the other hand, the beſt voice may be greatly hurt by ill management and indiſcretion. Temperance is a great preſervative of the voice, and all exceſs is highly prej<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>udicial to it. The voice muſt neceſſarily ſuffer, if the organs of ſpeech have not their proper tone. A ſtrong voice is very ſerviceable to an orator, becauſe, if he want ſome other advantages, he is, however, capable to make himſelf heard. And if at any time he is forced to ſtrain it, he is in leſs danger of its failing him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he has finiſhed his diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>But he, who has a weak voice, ſhould be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to ſtrain it, eſpecially at firſt. He ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin low, and riſe gradually to ſuch a pitch as the key of his voice will well carry him, without being obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſink again afterwards. Frequent inflections of the voice will likewiſe be ſome aſſiſtance to him. But eſpecially he ſhould take care to ſpeak deliberately, and eaſe his voice, by allowing due time for reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all the proper pauſes. It is an extreme much leſs inconvenient for ſuch a perſon rather to ſpeak too ſlow, than too faſt. But this defect of a weak voice is ſometimes capable of being helped by the uſe of proper methods; as is evident from the inſtance of Demoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenes, before mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Some perſons, either from want of due care in their education at firſt, or from inadvertency and negligence
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031827_0017_0FEEC2DFB48D75F0"/>
afterwards, run into a very irregular and confuſed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of expreſſing their words; either by miſplacing the accent, confounding the ſound of the letters, or hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling the ſyllables one upon another ſo as to render what they ſay often unintelligible. Indeed, ſometimes this ariſes from a natural defect, as in the caſe of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes; who found a method to rectify that, as well as the weakneſs of his voice. But in faults of this kind, which proceed from habit, doubtleſs the moſt likely way to mend them is to ſpeak deliberately.</p>

                  <head>OF GESTURE.</head>
                  <p>BY this is meant, a ſuitable conformity of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the countenance, and ſeveral parts of the body in ſpeaking, to the ſubject-matter of the diſcourſe. It is not agreed among the learned, whether voice or geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has the greater influence upon us. But as the latter affects us by the eye, as the former does by the ear, geſture in the nature of it ſeems to have this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that it conveys the impreſſion more ſpeedily to the mind; for the ſight is the quickeſt of all our ſenſes. Nor is its influence leſs upon our paſſions; nay, in ſome inſtances, it appears to act more powerfully. A caſt of the eye will expreſs deſire in as moving a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the ſofteſt language; and a different motion of it, reſentment.</p>
                  <p>To wring the hands, tear the hair, or ſtrike the breaſt, are all ſtrong indications of ſorrow. And he, who claps his hand to his ſword, threws us into a greater panic than one who only threatens to kill us. Nor is it in ſome reſpects leſs various and extenſive language. Cicero tells us, he often diverted himſelf by trying this with Roſcius the comedian; who could expreſs a ſentence as many ways by his geſtures, as he himſelf could by words. And ſome dramas, called pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomimes, have been carried on wholly by mutes, who
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031827_0018_0FEE92C611D4BE38"/>
have performed every part by geſtures only, without words, in a way very intelligible.</p>
                  <p>But with reſpect to oratory, geſture may very prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly be called the ſecond part of pronunciation; in which, as the voice ſhould be ſuited to the impreſſions it receives from the mind, ſo the ſeveral motions of the body ought to be accommodated to the various tones and inflections of the voice. When the voice is even and moderate, little geſture is required; and nothing is more unnatural than violent motion, in diſcourſing upon ordinary and familiar ſubjects. The motions of the body ſhould riſe therefore in proportion to the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence and energy of the expreſſion, as the natural and genuine effect of it.</p>
                  <p>But as geſture is very different and various as to the manner of it, which depends upon the decent conduct of ſeveral parts of the body, it will not be amiſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider more particularly the proper management of each of thoſe parts. Now all geſture is either natural, or from imitation. By natural geſture, we mean ſuch actions and motions of the body, as naturally accompany our words, as theſe do the impreſſions of our mind. And theſe either reſpect the whole body, or ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular part of it.</p>
                  <p>The ſpeaker ſhould not long continue ſtanding in the ſame poſition, like a ſtatue, but be conſtantly chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though the motion be very moderate. There ought to be no appearance of ſtiffneſs, but a certain eaſe and pliableneſs, naturally ſuiting itſelf to every expreſſion; by which means, when a greater degree of motion is neceſſary, it will appear leſs ſudden and vehement: for as the raiſing, ſinking, and various in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of the voice muſt be gradual, ſo likewiſe ſhould the motions of the body. It is only on ſome particular occaſions that a haſty vehemence and impet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoſity is proper in either caſe.</p>
                  <p>As to the ſeveral parts of the body, the head is the moſt conſiderable. To lift it up too high has the air of arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and pride; to ſtretch it out too far, or throw it
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031827_0019_0FEEC2E40B205F98"/>
back, looks clowniſh and unmannerly: to hang it down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards on the breaſt, ſhows an unmanly baſhfulneſs and want of ſpirit: and to ſuffer it to lean on either ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, argues both ſloth and indolence. Wherefore, in calm and ſedate diſcourſe, it ought to keep its natural ſtate, an upright poſture. However, it ſhould not be long without motion, nor yet always moving; but gently turn ſometimes on one ſide, and ſometimes on the other, as occaſion requires, that the voice may be heard by all who are preſent; and then return again to its natural poſition. It ſhould always accompany the other actions of the body, and turn on the ſame ſide with them; except when averſion to any thing is expreſſed; which is done by ſtretching out the right hand, and turning the head to the left.</p>
                  <p>But it is the countenance, that chiefly repreſents both the paſſions and diſpoſitions of the mind. By this we expreſs love, hatred, joy, ſorrow, modeſty, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: by this we ſupplicate, threaten, ſoothe, invite, forbid, conſent, or refuſe; and all this without ſpeaking. Nay, from hence we form a judgment not only of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's preſent temper, but of his capacity and natural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. And therefore it is common to ſay, ſuch a one has a "promiſing countenance," or that "he promiſes little by his countenance." It is true, this is no certain rule of judging; nor is it in the power of any one to alter the natural make of his countenance.</p>
                  <p>But the ſeveral parts of the face bear their part, and contribute to the proper and decent motion of the whole. In a calm and ſedate diſcourſe, all the features retain their natural ſtate and ſituation. In ſorrow, the forehead and eyebrows lour, and the cheeks hang down. But in expreſſions of joy and cheerfulneſs, the forehead and eyebrows are expanded, the cheeks contracted, and the corners of the mouth drawn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Anger and reſentment contract the forehead, draw the brows toge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>er, and thruſt out the lips. And terror elevates both the brows and forehead. As theſe
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031827_0020_0FEEC2E8550656E8"/>
are the natural ſigns of ſuch paſſions, the orator ſhould endeavor to conform to them.</p>
                  <p>But as the eyes are moſt active and ſignificant, it is the advice of Cicero that the greateſt care ſhould be taken in their management. And he gives this reaſon for it. "Becauſe other parts of the countenance have but few motions; whereas all the paſſions of the ſoul are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the eyes, by ſo many different actions, which cannot poſſibly be repreſented by any geſtures of the body, if the eyes are kept in a fixed poſture." Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon experience does in a great meaſure confirm the truth of this obſervation. We readily gueſs at a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's intention, or how he is affected to us by his eyes. And any ſudden change or emotion of the mind is preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently followed by an alteration in the look.</p>
                  <p>In ſpeaking therefore upon pleaſant and delightful ſubjects, the eyes are briſk and cheerful; as, on the contrary, they ſink and are languid in delivering any thing melancholy and ſorrowful. This is ſo agreeable to nature, that before a perſon ſpeaks, we are prepared with the expectation of one or the other from his dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent aſpect. So likewiſe in anger, a certain vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence and intenſeneſs appears in the eyes, which, for want of proper words to expreſs it by, we endeavor to repreſent by metaphors taken from fire, the moſt violent and rapid element; and ſay in ſuch caſes, the eyes ſparkle, burn, or are inflamed. In expreſſions of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred or deteſtation, it is natural to alter the looks, either by turning the eyes aſide, or downwards.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, the eyes are ſometimes turned downwards upon other occaſions, as to expreſs modeſty. And if at any time a particular object be addreſſed, whatever it be, the eyes ſhould be turned that way. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Philoſtratus very deſervedly ridicules a certain rhetorician as guilty of a ſoleciſm in geſture, who, upon ſaying, O Jupiter! turned his eyes downwards; and when he ſaid, O Earth! looked upward. A ſtaring look has the appearance of giddineſs and want of thought; and to contract the eyes gives ſuſpicion of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031827_0021_0FEEC2EE00211C90"/>
craft and deſign. A fixed look may be occaſioned from intenſeneſs of thought; but at the ſame time ſhows a diſregard to the audience; and a too quick and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering motion of the eyes denotes levity and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. A gentle and moderate motion of the eyes is, therefore, in common, moſt ſuitable; always directed to ſome of the audience, and gradually turning from ſide to ſide with an air of reſpect and modeſty, and looking them decently in the face, as in common diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Such a behaviour will of courſe draw an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
                  <p>As to the other parts of the body diſtinct from the head, the ſhoulders ought not to be elevated; for this is not only in itſelf indecent; but it likewiſe contracts the neck, and hinders the proper motion of the head. Nor, on the other hand, ſhould they be drawn down and depreſſed; becauſe this occaſions a ſtiffneſs both to the neck and the whole body. Their natural poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture therefore is beſt, as being moſt eaſy and graceful. To ſhrug the ſhoulders has an abject and ſervile air; and frequently to heave them upwards and downwards is a very diſagreeable ſight. A continued motion of the arms any way, is by all means to be avoided. Their action ſhould generally be very moderate, and follow that of the hands; unleſs in very pathetic expreſſions, where it may be proper to give them a more lively ſpring.</p>
                  <p>Now, all bodily motion is either upward or down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to the right or left, forward or backward, or elſe circular. The hands are employed by the orator in all theſe except the laſt. And as they ought to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond with our expreſſions, ſo they ought to begin and end with them. In admiration, and addreſſes to heaven, they muſt be elevated, but never raiſed above the eyes; and in ſpeaking of things below us, they are directed downwards. Side motion ſhould generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin from the left, and terminate gently on the right. In demonſtrating, addreſſing, and on ſeveral other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, they are moved forward; and in threatening,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031827_0022_0FEEC2F49C160870"/>
ſometimes thrown back. But when the orator ſpeaks of himſelf, his right hand ſhould be gently laid on his breaſt.</p>
                  <p>The left hand ſhould ſeldom move alone, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate itſelf to the motions of the right. In motions to the left ſide, the right hand ſhould not be carried beyond the left ſhoulder. In promiſes, and expreſſions of compliment, the motion of the hands ſhould be gentle and ſlow: but in exhortations and applauſe, more ſwift. The hands ſhould generally be open; but in expreſſions of compunction and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they may be cloſed. All ſinical and trifling actions of the fingers ought to be avoided; nor ſhould they be ſtretched out and expanded in a ſtiff and rigid poſture, but kept eaſy and pliable.</p>
                  <p>The geſtures we have hitherto diſcourſed of, are ſuch as naturally accompany our expreſſions. And we believe thoſe we have mentioned, if duly attended to, will be found ſufficient to anſwer all the purpoſes of our modern pronunciation. The other ſort of geſtures above mentioned are ſuch as ariſe from imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as where the orator deſcribes ſome action or perſonates another ſpeaking. But here great care is to be taken not to overact his part by running into any ludicrous or theatrical mimicry. It is ſufficient for him to repreſent things of this nature, as may beſt convey the image of them in a lively manner to the minds of the hearers; without any ſuch changes either of his actions or voice as are not ſuitable to his own character.</p>

                  <head>SOME PARTICULAR RULES FOR THE VOICE AND GESTURE.</head>
                  <p>WE ſhall begin with the parts of a diſcourſe, and treat of them in their natural order. And here the view and deſign of the ſpeaker in each of them will eaſily help us to ſee the proper manner of pronunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031827_0023_0FEEC2F75E0D5FE8"/>
Let us ſuppoſe then a perſon preſenting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before an aſſembly, in order to make a diſcourſe to them. It cannot be decent immediately to begin to ſpeak ſo ſoon as ever he makes his appearance. He will firſt ſettle himſelf, compoſe his countenance, and take a reſpectful view of his audience. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares them for ſilence and attention.</p>
                  <p>Perſons commonly form ſome opinion of a ſpeaker from their firſt view of him, which prejudices them either in his favor or otherwiſe, as to what he ſays afterwards. A grave and ſedate aſpect inclines them to think him ſerious; that he had conſidered his ſubject, and may have ſomething to offer worth their attention. A haughty and forbidding air occaſions diſtaſte, as it looks like diſreſpect. A wandering giddy countenance argues levity. A dejected drooping appearance is apt to raiſe contempt, unleſs where the ſubject is melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly. And a cheerful aſpect is a proper prelude to a pleaſant and agreeable argument.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeak low at firſt has the appearance of modeſty, and is beſt for the voice; which, by riſing gradually, will with more eaſe be carried to any pitch that may be afterwards neceſſary, without ſtraining it. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſome variation of the voice is always proper to give it harmony. Nay, and ſometimes it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for an orator to ſet out with a conſiderable degree of warmth. We have ſome few inſtances of this in Cicero; as in his oration for Roſcius Amerinus, where the heinouſneſs of the charge could not but excite his indignation againſt the accuſers. And ſo likewiſe in that againſt Piſo, and the two firſt againſt Catiline, which begin in the ſame manner, from the reſentment he had conceived againſt their perſons and conduct.</p>
                  <p>In the narration, the voice ought to be raiſed to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what a higher pitch. Matters of fact ſhould be related in a very plain and diſtinct manner, with a proper ſtreſs and emphaſis laid upon each circumſtance, accompanied with a ſuitable addreſs and motions of the body to engage the attention of the hearers. For there is a certain
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:031827_0024_0FEEC2FA34950B58"/>
grace in telling a ſtory, by which thoſe who are maſters of it ſeldom fail to recommend themſelves in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
                  <p>The propoſition, or ſubject of the diſcourſe ſhould be delivered with a very clear and audible voice. For if this be not plainly heard, all that follows in proof of it cannot well be underſtood. And for the ſame reaſon, if it be divided into ſeveral parts or branches, they ſhould each be expreſſed very deliberately and diſtinctly. But as the deſign here is only information, there can be little room for geſture.</p>
                  <p>The confirmation admits of great variety both of the voice and geſture. In reaſoning, the voice is quick and pungent, and ſhould be enforced with ſuitable actions. And as deſcriptions likewiſe have often a place here, in painting out the images of things, the orator ſhould ſo endeavor to adapt both his voice, and the motions of his body, particularly the turn of his eyes, and action of his hands, as may beſt help the imagination of his hearers. Where he introduces another perſon ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or addreſſes an abſent perſon, it ſhould be with ſome degree of imitation. And in dialogue, the voice ſhould alter with the parts. When he diverts from his ſubject by any digreſſion, his voice ſhould be lively and cheerful; ſince that is rather deſigned for entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>In confutation, the arguments of the adverſe party ought firſt to be repeated in a plain and diſtinct man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the ſpeaker may not ſeem to conceal, or avoid the force of them. Unleſs they appear trifling and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of a ſerious anſwer; and then a facetious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, both of expreſſion and geſture, may be the moſt proper way to confute them. For to attempt to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, in a grave and ſerious manner, what is in itſelf empty and ludicrous, is apt to create a ſuſpicion of its having more in it than it really has.</p>
                  <p>But caution ſhould be uſed not to repreſent any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of weight in a ludicrous way, leſt by ſo doing the ſpeaker ſhould more expoſe himſelf than his adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:031827_0025_0FEEC2FE77A20CD8"/>
In the concluſion, both the voice and geſture ſhould be briſk and ſprightly; which may ſeem to ariſe from a ſenſe of the ſpeaker's opinion of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his cauſe, and that he has offered nothing but what is agreeable to reaſon and truth; as likewiſe from his aſſurance that the audience agree with him in the ſame ſentiment. If an enumeration of the principal arguments of the diſcourſe be convenient, as it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is, where they are pretty numerous, or the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe is long, they ought to be expreſſed in the moſt clear and forcible manner. And if there be an addreſs to the paſſions, both the voice and geſture muſt be ſuited to the nature of them.</p>
                  <p>We proceed now to the conſideration of particular expreſſions. And what we ſhall offer here, will be in relation to ſingle words, ſentences, and the paſſions. Even in thoſe ſentences which are expreſſed in the moſt even and ſedate manner, there is often one or more words which require an emphaſis and diſtinction of the voice. Pronouns are often of this kind; as, <hi>this</hi> is the man. And ſuch are many words that denote the circumſtances and qualities of things. Such as heighten or magnify the idea of the thing to which they are joined, elevate the voice; as <hi>unable, admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, majeſtic, greatly,</hi> and the like. On the contrary, thoſe which leſſen the idea, or debaſe it, depreſs the voice, or at leaſt protract the tone: of which ſort are the words <hi>little, mean, poorly, contemptible,</hi> with many others.</p>
                  <p>Some tropes, likewiſe, as metaphors and verbal fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures, which conſiſt in the repetition of a ſingle word, ſhould have a particular emphaſis. As when Virgil ſays of the river Araxes, "It <hi>diſdained</hi> a bridge." And Niſus of himſelf, in the ſame poet, "I, <hi>I</hi> am the man;" where the repeated word is loudeſt. This diſtinction of words, and giving them their proper emphaſis, does not only render the expreſſion more clear and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible, but very much contributes to the variation of the voice, and the preventing of a monotony.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="unknown:031827_0026_0FEEC300028D8C98"/>In ſentences, regard ſhould be had to their length, and the number of their parts, in order to diſtinguiſh them by proper pauſes. The frame and ſtructure of the period ought likewiſe to be conſidered, that the voice may be ſo managed as to give it the moſt muſical accent. Unleſs there be ſome ſpecial reaſon for the contrary, it ſhould end louder than it begins. And this difference of tone between the end of the former ſentence and the beginning of the next, not only helps to diſtinguiſh the ſenſe, but adds to the harmony of the voice.</p>
                  <p>In an antitheſis, or a ſentence conſiſting of oppoſite parts, one contrary muſt be louder than the other. As, "He is gone, but by a <hi>gainful</hi> remove, from <hi>pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful labor</hi> to <hi>quiet reſt</hi>; from <hi>unquiet deſire</hi> to <hi>happy contentment:</hi> from <hi>ſorrow</hi> to <hi>joy;</hi> and from <hi>tranſitory time</hi> to <hi>immortality.</hi>" In a climax or gradation, the voice ſhould generally riſe with it. Thus, "There is no enjoyment of property without government; no govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without a magiſtrate; no magiſtrate without obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience; no obedience where every one acts as he pleaſes." And ſo in other gradations of a different form; as, "Since concord was loſt, friendſhip was loſt, fidelity was loſt, liberty was loſt, all was loſt."</p>
                  <p>That the paſſions have each of them both a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent voice and action, is evident from hence, that we know in what manner a perſon is affected, by the tone of his voice, though we do not underſtand the ſenſe of what he ſays, or many times ſo much as ſee him; and we can often make the ſame judgment from his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance and geſtures. Love and eſteem are expreſſed in a ſmooth and cheerful tone; but anger and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, with a rough, harſh, and interrupted voice; for when the ſpirits are ruffled, the organs are moved unequally. Joy raiſes and dilates the voice, as ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſinks and contracts it. Cicero takes notice of a paſſage in an oration of Gracchus, wherein he bewails the death of his brother, who was killed by Scipio, which in his time was thought very moving: "Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:031827_0027_0FEEC301892BDEB0"/>
man (ſays he,) whither ſhall I betake myſelf? Where ſhall I go? Into the capitol? that flows with my broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's blood. Shall I go home, and behold my unhappy mother all in tears and deſpair?"</p>
                  <p>Though Gracchus had a very ill deſign in that ſpeech, and his view was to excite the populace againſt their governors, yet (as Cicero tells us) when he came to this paſſage, he expreſſed himſelf in ſuch moving accents and geſtures that he extorted tears even from his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Fear occaſions a tremor and heſitation of the voice, and aſſurance gives it ſtrength and firmneſs. Admiration elevates the voice, and ſhould be expreſſed with pomp and magnificence. "O ſurpriſing clemency, worthy of the higheſt praiſe and greateſt encomiums, and fit to be perpetuated in laſting monuments!" This is Cicero's compliment to Ceſar, when he thought it for his purpoſe. And oftentimes this paſſion is accompanied with an elevation both of the eyes and hands. On the contrary, contempt ſinks and protracts the voice.</p>
                  <p>All exclamations ſhould be violent. When we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs inanimate things, the voice ſhould be higher th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe few hints for expreſſing the principal paſſions may, if duly attended to, ſuffice to direct our practice in others. Though after all, it is impoſſible to gain a juſt and decent pronunciation of voice and geſture merely from rules, without practice and an imitation of the beſt examples: which ſhows the wiſdom of the ancients, in training up their youth to it, by the aſſiſtance of maſters, to form both their ſpeech and actions. But here, as has been before obſerved, great caution ſhould be uſed in directing our choice of an example. An affected imitation of others, in pronunciation or geſture, eſpecially of ſtage-players, whoſe pretenſions to litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are ſeldom conſiderable, and who are generally too fond of <hi>ſingularity,</hi> ought to be carefully avoided. For nothing can appear more diſguſting to perſons of diſcernment than affectation.</p>

                  <p>THE excellence, utility, and importance of ELO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUENCE; its origin, progreſs, and preſent ſtate; and its ſuperior claim to the particular attention of Columbia's free-born ſons, will exerciſe for a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the patience of this learned, polite, and reſpected aſſembly.</p>
                  <p>Speech and reaſon are the characteriſtics, the glory, and the happineſs of man. Theſe are the pillars which ſupport the fair fabric of eloquence; the foundation, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which is erected the moſt magnificent edifice, that genius could deſign, or art conſtruct. To cultivate elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, then, is to improve the nobleſt faculties of our nature, the richeſt talents with which we are intruſted. A more convincing proof of the dignity and importance of our ſubject need not, cannot be advanced.</p>
                  <p>The benevolent deſign and the beneficial effects of eloquence, evince its great ſuperiority over every other art, which ever exerciſed the ingenuity of man. To inſtruct, to perſuade, to pleaſe; theſe are its objects.
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:031827_0029_0FEEC3097980B400"/>
To ſcatter the clouds of ignorance and error from the atmoſphere of reaſon; to remove the film of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice from the mental eye; and thus to irradiate the benighted mind with the cheering beams of truth, is at once the buſineſs and the glory of eloquence.</p>
                  <p>To promote the innocent and refined pleaſures of the fancy and intellect; to ſtrip the monſter vice of all his borrowed charms, and expoſe to view his native defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; to diſplay the reſiſtleſs attractions of virtue; and, in one word, to rouſe to action all the latent energies of man, in the proper and ardent purſuit of the great end of his exiſtence, is the orator's pleaſing, benevolent, ſublime employment.</p>
                  <p>Nor let it be objected, that eloquence ſometimes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes the courſe of juſtice, and ſcreens the guilty from the puniſhment due to their crimes. Is there any thing which is not obnoxious to abuſe? Even the benign religion of the Prince of Peace has been made the unwilling inſtrument of the greateſt calamities ever experienced by man. The greater the benefits which naturally reſult from any thing, the more pernicious are its effects, when diverted from its proper courſe. This objection to eloquence is therefore its higheſt eulogium.</p>
                  <p>The orator does not ſucceed, as ſome would inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, by dazzling the eye of reaſon with the illuſive glare of his rhetorical art, nor, by ſilencing her ſtill ſmall voice in the thunder of his declamation; for to her impartial tribunal he refers the truth and propriety of whatever he aſſerts or propoſes. After fairly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing the underſtanding, he may, without the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of diſingenuouſneſs, proceed to addreſs the fancy and the paſſions. In this way he will more effectually transfuſe into his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>earers his own ſentiments, and make every ſpring in the human machine co-operate in the production of the deſired effect.</p>
                  <p>The aſtoniſhing powers of eloquence are well known, at leaſt to thoſe who are converſant in ancient hiſtory. Like a reſiſtleſs torrent, it bears down every obſtacle, and turns even the current of oppoſing ignorance and
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:031827_0030_0FEEC313C4C19EF0"/>
prejudice into the deſired channel of active and zealous compliance. It is indiſputably the moſt potent art with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of human acquirement. An Alexander and a Ceſar could conquer a world; but to overcome the paſſions, to ſubdue the wills, and to command at pleaſure the inclinations of men, can be effected only by the all-powerful charm of enrapturing eloquence.</p>
                  <p>Though it be more than probable, that oratory was known and cultivated in ſome degree in thoſe eaſtern nations, where ſcience firſt began to dawn upon the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet it was not till Greece became civilized and formed into diſtinct governments, that it made its appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in its native, peerleſs majeſty. Here we may fix the era of eloquence; here was its morn; here its meridian too; for here it ſhone with ſplendor never ſince ſurpaſſed.</p>
                  <p>It is a common and a juſt remark, that eloquence can flouriſh only in the ſoil of liberty. Athens was a republic, where the affairs of ſtate were tranſacted in the aſſembly of the whole people. This afforded to eloquence a field too fertile to remain long uncultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the ingenious Athenians. Orators ſoon made their appearance, who did honor to language, to Greece, to humanity.</p>
                  <p>But though the names of many have been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to us, whoſe genius and eloquence demand our veneration and applauſe; yet, like ſtars when the ſun appears, they are loſt in the ſuperior blaze of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Demoſthenes. His ſtory is well known; and his example affords the greateſt encouragement to ſtudents in eloquence; as it proves, that, by art, almoſt in defiance of nature, a man may attain ſuch excellence in oratory, as ſhall ſtamp his name with the ſeal of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality. Demoſthenes and the liberty of Greece to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether expired; and from this period we hear very little more of Grecian eloquence.</p>
                  <p>Let us now direct our attention to that other gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of eloquence, the Roman commonwealth. Here, as in Greece, a free government opened the liſt to ſuch as wiſhed to diſpute the palm in oratory. Numbers
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:031827_0031_0FEEC318EDFE6DE8"/>
advance, and contend manfully for the prize. But their glory is ſoon to fade; for Cicero appears; Cicero, another name for eloquence itſelf. It is needleſ to enlarge on his character as an orator. Suffice it to ſay, that if we ranſack the hiſtories of the world to find a rival for Demoſthenes, Cicero alone can be found capable of ſupporting a claim to that diſtinguiſhed honor.</p>
                  <p>And when did Greece or Rome preſent a fairer field for eloquence, than that which now invites the culture of the enlightened citizens of Columbia? We live in a republic, the orator's natal ſoil; we enjoy as much liberty, as is conſiſtent with the nature of man; we poſſeſs as a nation all the advantages which climate, ſoil, and ſituation can beſtow; and nothing but <hi>real merit</hi> is here required as a qualification for the moſt dignified offices of ſtate. Never had eloquence more ample ſcope.</p>
                  <p>And ſhall we reſt ſatisfied with only admiring, or at moſt with following at an awful diſtance the moſt illuſtrious orators of Greece and Rome? Shall every other uſeful and ornamental art ſpeed ſwiftly towards perfection, while oratory, that moſt ſublime of all arts; that art, which could render one man more dreadful to a tyrant, than hoſtile fleets and armies, is almoſt forgotten? It muſt not, cannot be. That refinement of taſte, that laudable ambition to excel in every thing which does honor to humanity, which diſtinguiſhes the Americans, and their free and popular government, are ſo many ſprings, which, though not inſtantane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their operation, cannot fail in time to raiſe Columbian eloquence "above all Greek, above all Roman fame."</p>
                  <p>With pleaſure we deſcry the dawning of that bright day of eloquence, which we have anticipated. The grand council of our nation has already evinced, that in this reſpect, as in all others, our republic ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges no exiſting ſuperior. And we truſt, that, as our ſacred teachers make it their conſtant endeavor
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:031827_0032_0FEEC31C4EE3B0F8"/>
to imitate the great learning, the exemplary virtue, the exalted piety, and the extenſive uſefulneſs of the great apoſtle of the Gentiles, they will not fail to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble him in that commanding, that heavenly elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which made an avaricious, an unbeliving Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix tremble.</p>
                  <p>May Columbia always afford more than one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes, to ſupport the ſacred cauſe of freedom, and to thunder terror in the ears of every tranſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic Philip. May more than Ciceronian eloquence be ever ready to plead for injured innocence, and ſuffering virtue. Warned by the fate of her prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, may ſhe eſcape thoſe quickſands of vice, which have ever proved the bane of empire. May her glory and her felicity increaſe with each revolving year, till the laſt trump ſhall announce the cataſtrophe of nature, and time ſhall immerge in the ocean of eternity.</p>

                  <p>AMONG the viciſſitudes incident to life, no event could have filled me with greater anxieties than that of which the notification was tranſmitted by your order, and received on the 14th day of the preſent month. On the one hand, I was ſummoned by my country, whoſe voice I can never hear but with vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and love, from a retreat which I had choſen with the fondeſt predilection, and, in my flattering hopes, with an immutable deciſion, as the aſylum of my declining years. A retreat which was rendered every day more neceſſary as well as more dear to me, by the addition of habit to inclination, and of frequent interruptions in my health to the gradual waſte com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on it by time.</p>

                  <p>In this conflict of emotions, all I dare aver is, that it has been my faithful ſtudy to collect my duty from a juſt appreciation of every circumſtance by which it might be affected. All I dare hope is, that if, in executing this taſk I have been too much ſwayed by a grateful remembrance of former inſtances, or by an affectionate ſenſibility to this tranſcendent proof of the confidence of my fellow-citizens, and have thence too little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted my incapacity as well as diſinclination for the weighty and untried cares before me, my error will be palliated by the motives which miſled me; and its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences be judged by my country, with ſome ſhare of the partiality in which they originated.</p>
                  <p>Such being the impreſſions under which I have, in obedience to the public ſummons, repaired to the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtation, it would be peculiarly improper to omit in this firſt official act, my ſervent ſupplications to that Almighty Being, who rules over the univerſe, who preſides in the councils of nations, and whoſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential aids can ſupply every human defect, that his benediction may conſecrate to the liberties and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the people of the United States, a government inſtituted by themſelves for theſe eſſential purpoſes; and may enable every inſtrument employed in its ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, to execute with ſucceſs, the ſunctions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to his charge.

Every ſtep, by which they have advanced to the character of an independent nation, ſeems to have been diſtinguiſhed by ſome token of providential agency. And in the important revolution juſt accompliſhed in the ſyſtem of their united government, the tranquil deliberations and voluntary conſent of ſo many diſtinct communities, from which the event has reſulted, cannot be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the means by which moſt governments have been eſtabliſhed, without ſome return of pious grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude with a humble anticipation of the future bleſſings which the paſt ſeem to preſage.

But ſome may aſk, How then ſhall we act reaſonably? I anſwer, by not ſuffering any perſons to obtrude their advice upon your generals, but ſuch as are, in the firſt place, verſed in the art of war, and have learned from experience what it is to command; and in the ſecond place, who are upon the ſpot; who know the enemy; are witneſſes in perſon to all that paſſes; and ſharers with us in all dangers.</p>
                  <p>If there be any one, who conceives himſelf capable of aſſiſting me with his counſels in the war you have charged me with, let him not refuſe to do the republic that ſervice; but let him go with me into Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia. Ships, horſes, tents, proviſions, ſhall all be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for him at my charge. But if he will not take ſo much trouble, and prefers the tranquillity of the city to the dangers and fatigues of the field, let him not take upon him to hold the helm, and continue idle in the port. The city of itſelf ſupplies ſufficient mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of diſcourſe on other ſubjects; but as for theſe, let it be ſilent upon them; and know, that we ſhall pay no regard to any counſels, but ſuch as ſhall be given us in the camp itſelf.</p>

                  <head>EXHORTATION ON TEMPERANCE IN PLEASURE.</head>
                  <p>LET me particularly exhort youth to temperance in pleaſure. Let me admoniſh them, to beware of that rock on which thouſands, from race to race, continue to ſplit. The love of pleaſure, natural to man in every period of his life, glows at this age with exceſſive ardor. Novelty adds freſh charms, as yet, to every gratification. The world appears to
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:031827_0037_0FEEC32690339158"/>
ſpread a continual feaſt; and health, vigor, and high ſpirits, invite them to partake of it without reſtraint. In vain we warn them of latent dangers. Religion is accuſed of inſufferable ſeverity, in prohibiting enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and the old, when they offer their admonitions, are upbraided with having forgotten that they once were young.</p>
                  <p>And yet, my friends, to what do the reſtraints of religion, and the counſels of age, with reſpect to pleaſure, amount? They may all be compriſed in few words, not to hurt yourſelves, and not to hurt others, by your purſuit of pleaſure. Within theſe bounds, pleaſure is lawful; beyond them, it becomes criminal, becauſe it is ruinous. Are theſe reſtraints any other, than what a wiſe man would chooſe to impoſe on himſelf? We call you not to renounce pleaſure, but to enjoy it in ſafety. Inſtead of abridging it, we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you to purſue it on an extenſive plan. We pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe meaſures for ſecuring its poſſeſſion, and for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing its duration.</p>
                  <p>Conſult your whole nature. Conſider yourſelves not only as ſenſitive, but as rational beings; not only as rational, but ſocial; not only as ſocial, but immortal. Whatever violates your nature, in any of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, cannot afford true pleaſure; any more than that which undermines an eſſential part of the vital ſyſtem can promote health. For the truth of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, we appeal, not merely to the authority of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, nor to the teſtimony of the aged, but to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and your own experience. We aſk, whether you have not found, that in a courſe of criminal exceſs, your pleaſure was more than compenſated by ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pain? Whether, if not from every particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, yet from every habit, at leaſt, of unlawful gratification, there did not ſpring ſome thorn to wound you; there did not ariſe ſome conſequence to make you repent of it in the i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

folly, and tamely expoſe yourſelves to be caught in the ſame ſnare? If you have any conſideration, or any firmneſs left, avoid temptations, for which you have found yourſelves unequal, with as much care as you would ſhun peſtilential infection. Break off all connexions with the looſe and profligate. "When ſinners entice thee, conſent thou not. Look not on the wine when it is red, when it giveth its color in the cup; for at the laſt, it biteth like a ſerpent, and ſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth like an adder. Remove thy way from the ſtrange woman, and come not near the door of her houſe. Let not thine heart decline to her ways; for her houſe is the way to hell. Thou goeſt after her as a bird haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teneth to the ſnare, and knoweth not that it is for his life."</p>
                  <p>By theſe unhappy exceſſes of irregular pleaſure in youth, how many amiable diſpoſitions are corrupted or deſtroyed! How many riſing capacities and powers are ſuppreſſed! How many flattering hopes of parents and friends are totally extinguiſhed! Who but muſt drop a tear over human nature, when he beholds that morning which aroſe ſo bright, overcaſt with ſuch untimely darkneſs; that good humor which once capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated all hearts; that vivacity which ſparkled in every company; thoſe abilities which were fitted for adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the higheſt ſtation, all ſacrificed at the ſhrine of low ſenſuality; and one, who was formed for running the fair career of life in the midſt of public eſteem, cut off by his vices at the beginning of his courſe, or ſunk, for the whole of it, into inſignificancy and contempt!

                  <p>WHEN we appeared before you, Sir, the firſt time, we anſwered without reſerve, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſtricteſt truth, all the queſtions which you were pleaſed to put to us concerning our family. We acquainted you, that we had a father, heavily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with years, but ſtill more heavily with misfortunes; a father, whoſe whole life had been one continued ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle with adverſity. We added that we had a brother pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly dear to him, as the children born towards the end of their life generally are to old men, and who is the only one remaining of his mother; his brother hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come in early youth to a moſt tragical end.</p>
                  <p>You commanded us, as the proof of our veracity and innocence, to bring that brother unto you; and your command was delivered with ſuch threatenings, that the terror of them accompanied us all the way back to our country, and embittered the remainder of our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. We reported every thing minutely to our father, as you directed us. Reſolutely and long, he refuſed to intruſt us with the care of that child. Love ſuggeſted a thouſand cauſes of apprehenſion upon his account. He loaded us with the bittereſt reproaches for having declared that we had another brother.</p>
                  <p>Subdued by the famine, he at length reluctantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; and putting his beloved ſon, this unhappy youth, into our hands, conjured us by every dear, every awful name, to guard with tenderneſs his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious life; and as we would not ſee him expire before our eyes in anguiſh and deſpair, to bring him back in ſafety. He parted with him as with a limb torn from his own body; and in an agony of grief inexpreſſible, deplored the dreadful neceſſity which ſeparated him from a ſon, on whom all the happineſs of his life de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="42" facs="unknown:031827_0040_0FEEC32DAACD32F8"/>How then can we appear before a father of ſuch delicate ſenſibility? With what eyes ſhall we dare to look upon him, unleſs we carry back with us this ſon of his right hand, this ſtaff of his old age, whom, alas! you have condemned to ſlavery? The good old man will expire in horrors dreadful to nature, as ſoon as he ſhall find that his ſon is not with us.

I engaged by the moſt ſolemn promiſes, and the moſt ſacred pledges, to bring the child back. Me he intruſted with the ſacred depoſit, and of my hand he will require it. Have pity, I beſeech you, on the deplorable condition of an old man, ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of his laſt comfort; and whoſe miſery will be ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated by reflecting that he foreſaw its approach, and yet wanted reſolution to prevent it.</p>

                  <p>THIS is now perhaps the laſt time that I ſhall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs my country. I have explored the tenor of my paſt life. Nothing ſhall tear from me the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ord of my departed days. The enemies of reform have ſcrutinized, in a manner hitherto unexampled in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, every action I may have performed, every word I may have uttered. Of crimes, moſt foul and horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, have I been accuſed: of attempting to rear the ſtandard of civil war; to plunge this land in blood, and to cover it with deſolation. At every ſtep, as the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the crown advanced, my innocency has bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened. So far from inflaming the minds of men to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and outrage, all the witneſſes have concurred, that my only anxiety was, to impreſs upon them the neceſſity of peace, of good order, and of good morals.</p>
                  <p>What then has been my crime? Not the lending to a relation a copy of Mr. Paine's Works; not the giving away to another a few numbers of an innocent and conſtitutional publication; but for having dared to be, according to the meaſure of my feeble abilities, a ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous and active advocate for an equal repreſentation of the PEOPLE, in the HOUSE OF THE PEOPLE; for having dared to attempt to accompliſh a meaſure, by legal means, which was to diminiſh the weight of their taxes, and to put an end to the profuſion of their blood.</p>
                  <p>From my infancy to this moment, I have devoted myſelf to the cauſe of the PEOPLE. It is a good cauſe. It will ultimately prevail. It will finally tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. Say then openly, in your verdict, if you do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn me, which I preſume you will not, that it is for my attachment to this cauſe alone, and not for thoſe vain and wretched pretexts ſtated in the indictment, intended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to color and diſguiſe the real motives of my accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

The time will come, when men muſt ſtand or fall by their actions; when all human pageantry ſhall ceaſe; when the hearts of all ſhall be laid open to view.</p>
                  <p>If you regard your moſt important intereſts; if you wiſh that your conſciences ſhould whiſper to you words of conſolation, rather than ſpeak to you in the terrible language of remorſe, weigh well the verdict you are to pronounce.</p>
                  <p>As for me, I am careleſs and indifferent to my fate. I can look danger, and I can look death in the face; for I am ſhielded by the conſciouſneſs of my own recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. I may be condemned to languiſh in the receſſes of a dungeon. I may be doomed to aſcend the ſcaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. Nothing can deprive me of the recollection of the paſt; nothing can deſtroy my inward peace of mind, ariſing from the remembrance of having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged my duty.</p>

                  <p>TO us who dwell on its ſurface, the earth is by far the moſt extenſive orb that our eyes can any where behold. It is alſo clothed with verdure; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by trees; and adorned with a variety of beautiful decorations.

for animal ſubſiſtence, and are ſuppoſed to be abodes of intellectual life. All which, together with this our earthly habitation, are dependent on that grand diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſer of divine munificence, the ſun; receive their light from the diſtribution of his rays; derive their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from his divine agency.</p>
                  <p>The ſun is the great axle of heaven, about which, the globe we inhabit, and other more ſpacious orbs, wheel their ſtated courſes. The ſun, though ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſmaller than the dial it illuminates, is abundantly larger than this whole earth; on which ſo many lofty mountains riſe, and ſuch vaſt oceans roll. A line, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending through the centre of that reſplendent orb, would meaſure more than eight hundred thouſand miles. A girdle, formed to ſurround it, would require a length of millions. Were its ſolid contents to be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated, the account would overpower our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and be almoſt beyond the power of language to expreſs.</p>
                  <p>Are we ſtartled at theſe reports of aſtronomy? Are we ready to cry out in a tranſport of ſurpriſe, How mighty is the Being, who kindled ſuch a prodigious fire, and who keeps alive, from age to age, ſuch an enormous maſs of flame! Let us attend our philoſophic guides, and we ſhall be brought acquainted with ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulations more enlarged, and more amazing.</p>
                  <p>This ſun, with all attendant planets, is but a very little part of the grand machine of the univerſe. Ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſtar, though in appearance, no bigger than the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond that glitters on a lady's ring, is really a mighty globe; like the ſun in ſize, and in glory; no leſs ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; no leſs luminous than the radiant ſource of our day. So that every ſtar is not barely a world, but the centre of a magnificent ſyſtem; has a retinue of worlds, irradiated by its beams, and revolving round its attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive influence. All which are loſt to our ſight in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaſurable wilds of ether.</p>
                  <p>That the ſtars appear like ſo many diminutive, and ſcarcely diſtinguiſhable points, is owing to their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:031827_0044_0FEEC3350445F2C8"/>
and inconceivable diſtance. Such a diſtance, that a cannon ball, could it continue its impetuous flight, with unabating rapidity, would not reach the neareſt of thoſe twinkling luminaries for more than five hundred thouſand years!</p>
                  <p>Can any thing be more wonderful than theſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations? Yes; there are truths far more ſtupendous; there are ſcenes far more extenſive. As there is no end of the Almighty Maker's greatneſs, ſo no imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can ſet limits to his creating hand. Could you ſoar beyond the moon, and paſs through all the planetary choir; could you wing your way to the higheſt appar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtar, and take your ſtand on one of thoſe lofty pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles of heaven, you would there ſee other ſkies ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded; another ſun, diſtributing his inexhauſtible beams by day; other ſtars which gild the horrors of the alternate night; and other, perhaps nobler ſyſtems, eſtabliſhed in unknown profuſion, through the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs dimenſions of ſpace. Nor do the dominions of the univerſal Sovereign terminate there. Even at the end of this vaſt tour, you would find yourſelf advanced no further than the ſuburbs of creation; arrived only at the frontiers of the great JEHOVAH's kingdom.</p>

                  <head>EXTRACT FROM CATO'S SPEECH BEFORE THE ROMAN SENATE, AFTER THE CONSPIRACY OF CATILINE.</head>
                  <p>I HAVE often ſpoken before you, Fathers, with ſome extent, to complain of luxury and the greedineſs for money, the twin vices of our corrupt citizens; and have thereby drawn upon myſelf abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of enemies. As I never ſpared any fault in myſelf, I was not eaſily inclined to favor the criminal exceſſes of others.</p>
                  <p>But though you paid little regard to my remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, the Commonwealth has ſtill ſubſiſted by its own ſtrength; has borne itſelf up, notwithſtanding your neglect. It is not now the ſame. Our manners, good or bad, are not the queſtion, nor to preſerve the greatneſs and luſtre of the Roman empire; but to reſolve whether all we poſſeſs and govern, well or ill, ſhall continue ours, or be transferred with ourſelves to enemies.</p>
                  <p>At ſuch a time, in ſuch a ſtate, ſome talk to us of lenity and compaſſion. It is long that we have loſt the right names of things. The Commonwealth is in this deplorable ſituation, only becauſe we call beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:031827_0047_0FEEC396F527E518"/>
other people's eſtates, liberality, and audaciouſneſs in perpetrating crimes, courage.</p>
                  <p>Let ſuch men, ſince they will have it ſo, and it is become the eſtabliſhed mode, value themſelves upon their liberality at the expenſe of the Allies of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and of their lenity to the robbers of the public treaſury: but let them not make a largeſs of our blood; and, to ſpare a ſmall number of vile wretches, expoſe all good men to deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Do not imagine, Fathers, that it was by arms our anceſtors rendered this Commonwealth ſo great, from ſo ſmall a beginning. If it had been ſo, we ſhould now ſee it much more flouriſhing, as we have more al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies and citizens, more horſe and foot, than they had. But they had other things, that made them great, of which no traces remain amongſt us: at home, labor and induſtry; abroad, juſt and equitable government; a conſtancy of ſoul, and an innocence of manners, that kept them perfectly free in their councils; unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained either by the remembrance of paſt crimes, or by craving appetites to ſatisfy.</p>
                  <p>For theſe virtues, we have luxury and avarice; or madneſs to ſquander, joined with no leſs, to gain; the State is poor, and private men are rich. We ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire nothing but riches; we give ourſelves up to ſloth and effeminacy; we make no diſtinction between the good and the bad; whilſt ambition engroſſes all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of virtue. Do you wonder then, that danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſpiracies ſhould be formed? Whilſt you regard nothing but your private intereſt; whilſt voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſolely employs you at home, and avidity or favor governs you here, the Commonwealth, without defence, is expoſed to the devices of any one who thinks fit to attack it.</p>

                     <p>MERCURY, Charon's boat is on the other ſide of the water. Allow me, before it returns, to have ſome converſation with the North-American Savage, whom you brought hither with me. I never before ſaw one of that ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. He looks very grim. Pray, Sir, what is your name? I underſtand you ſpeak Engliſh.</p>

                     <p>Yes, I learned it in my childhood, having been bred for ſome years among the Engliſh of New-York. But, before I was a man, I returned to my val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iant countrymen, the Mohawks; and having been vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanouſly cheated by one of yours in the ſale of ſome ruin, I never cared to have any thing to do with them afterwards. Yet I took up the hatchet for them with the reſt of my tribe in the late war againſt France, and was killed while I was out upon a ſcalping party. But I died very well ſatisfied: for my brethren were vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious; and, before I was ſhot, I had gloriouſly ſcalp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeven men, and five women and children. In a former war, I had performed ſtill greater exploits. My name is the Bloody Bear: it was given me to expreſs my fierceneſs and valor.</p>

                     <p>Bloody Bear, I reſpect you, and am much your humble ſervant. My name is Tom Puſhwell, very well known at Arthur's. I am a gentleman by my birth, and by profeſſion a gameſter and man of hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or. I have killed men in fair fighting, in honorable ſingle combat; but don't underſtand cutting the throats of women and children.</p>

                     <speaker>Duel.</speaker>
                     <p>Sir, I was killed in a duel. A friend of mine had lent me a ſum of money; and after two or three years, being in great want himſelf, he aſked me to pay him. I thought his demand, which was ſomewhat peremptory, an affront to my honor, and ſent him a challenge. We met in Hyde Park. The fellow could not fence: but I was abſolutely the adroiteſt ſwordſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in England. So I gave him three or four wounds; but at laſt he ran upon me with ſuch impetuoſity, that he put me out of my play, and I could not prevent him from whipping me through the lungs. I died the next day, as a man of honor ſhould; without any ſnivelling ſigns of contrition or repentance: and he will follow me ſoon; for his ſurgeon has declared his wounds to be mortal. It is ſaid that his wife is dead of grief, and that his family of ſeven children will be undone by his death. So I am well revenged, and that is a comfort. For my part, I had no wife. I always hated marriage: my miſtreſs will take good care of herſelf, and my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are provided for at the foundling hoſpital.</p>

                     <p>Don't tell me of laws: I am a ſavage: I value no laws. Talk of laws to the Engliſhman: there are laws in his country; and yet you ſee he did not regard them. For they could never allow him to kill his fellow-ſubject, in time of peace, becauſe he aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to pay an honeſt debt.

                  <p>Brothers! You know I am not ſo wiſe as you are, therefore I aſk your advice in what I am now going to ſay. I have been thinking, before you come to action, to take a run to the weſtward, and feel the mind of my Indian brethren the Six Nations, and know how they ſtand; whether they are on your ſide, or for

your enemies. If I find they are againſt you, I will try to turn their minds. I think they will liſten to me; for they have always looked this way for advice, concerning all important news that comes from the riſing ſun. If they hearken to me, you will not be afraid of any danger from behind you. However their minds are affected, you ſhall ſoon know by me. Now I think I can do you more ſervice in this way than by marching off immediately to Boſton, and ſtaying there. It may be a great while before blood runs. Now, as I ſaid, you are wiſer than I, I leave this for your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, whether I come down immediately, or wait till I hear ſome blood is ſpilled.</p>
                  <p>Brothers! I would not have you think by this, that we are falling back from our engagements. We are ready to do any thing for your relief, and ſhall be guided by your counſel.</p>
                  <p>Brothers! one thing I aſk of you, if you ſend for me to fight, that you you will let me fight in my own Indian way. I am not uſed to fight Engliſh faſhion; therefore you muſt not expect I can train like your men. Only point out to me where your enemies keep, and that is all I ſhall want to know.</p>

gentlemen will come to this debate with all the temper and impartiality that his Majeſty recommends, and the importance of the ſubject requires. A ſubject of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er importance than ever engaged the attention of this Houſe! that ſubject only excepted, when, nearly a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury ago, it was the queſtion, whether you yourſelves were to be bond or free. In the mean time, as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not depend upon health for any future day, ſuch is the nature of my infirmities, I will beg to ſay a few words at preſent, leaving the juſtice, the equity, the policy, the expediency of the act to another time.</p>
                  <p>I will only ſpeak to one point, which ſeems not to have been generally underſtood. Some gentlemen ſeem to have conſidered it as a point of <hi>honor.</hi> If gentlemen conſider it in that light, they leave all meaſures of right and wrong, to follow a deluſion that may lead to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. It is my opinion, that this kingdom has no right to lay a tax upon the Colonies. When in this Houſe we give and grant, we give and grant what is our own. But in an American tax, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> do we do? We, your Majeſty's Commons of Great Britain, give and grant to your Majeſty, what? our own property? No. We give and grant to your Majeſty, the property of your Majeſty's Commons of America. It is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity in terms.</p>
                  <p>There is an idea in ſome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Colonies are vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually repreſented in this Houſe.

They would have been ſlaves if they had not enjoyed it.</p>
                  <p>A great deal has been ſaid without doors, of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, of the ſtrength of America. It is a topic which ought to be cautiouſly meddled with. In a good cauſe, on a ſound bottom, the force of this country can cruſh America to atoms. I know the valor of your troops. I know the ſkill of your officers. There is not a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of foot that has ſerved in America, out of which you may not pick a man of ſufficient knowledge and experience, to make a governor of a Colony there. But on this ground, on the Stamp Act, when ſo many here will think it a crying injuſtice, I am one who will lift up my hands againſt it.</p>
                  <p>In ſuch a cauſe, your ſucceſs would be hazardous. America, if ſhe fell, would fall like the ſtrong man. She would embrace the pillars of the State, and pull down the conſtitution along with her. Is this your boaſted peace? Not to ſheath the ſword in its ſcabbard, but to ſheath it in the bowels of your countrymen? Will you quarrel with yourſelves, now the whole Houſe of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon is united againſt you?</p>
                  <p>The Americans have been wronged. They have been driven to madneſs by injuſtice. Will you puniſh them for the madneſs you have occaſioned? Rather let prudence and temper come firſt from this ſide. I will undertake for America, that ſhe will follow the example.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, I will beg leave to tell the Houſe what is really my opinion. It is, that the Stamp Act <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <head>EXTRACT FROM THE EULOGY ON DR. FRANK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIN, PRONOUNCED BY THE ABBE FAUCHET, IN THE NAME OF THE COMMONS OF PARIS, 1790.</head>
                  <p>A SECOND creation has taken place; the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſociety begin to combine together; the moral univerſe is now ſeen iſſuing from chaos; the genius of Liberty is awakened, and ſprings up; ſhe ſheds her divine light and creative powers upon the two hemiſpheres. A great nation, aſtoniſhed at ſeeing herſelf free, ſtretches her arms from one extremity of the earth to the other, and embraces the firſt nation that became ſo: the foundations of a new city are cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in the two worlds; brother nations haſten to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit it. It is the city of mankind!</p>
                  <p>One of the firſt founders of this univerſal city was the immortal FRANKLIN, the deliverer of America. The ſecond founders, who accelerated this great work, made it worthy of Europe. The legiſlators of France have rendered the moſt ſolemn homage to his memory. They have ſaid, "A friend of humanity is dead; mankind ought to be overwhelmed with ſorrow! Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have hitherto only worn mourning for Kings; let us aſſume it for a Man, and let the tears of French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men mingle with thoſe of Americans, in order to do honor to the memory of one of the Fathers of Lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty!"</p>
                  <p>The city of Paris, which once contained this philoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opher within its walls, which was intoxicated with the pleaſure of hearing, admiring, and loving him; of gathering from his lips the maxims of a moral legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and of imbibing from the effuſions of his heart a paſſion for the public welfare, rivals Boſton and Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, his two native cities (for in one he was born as it were a man, and in the other a legiſlator) in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found attachment to his merit and his glory.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="65" facs="unknown:031827_0063_0FEEC3B019E983B0"/>It has commanded this funeral ſolemnity, in order to perpetuate the gratitude and the grief of this third country, which, by the courage and activity with which it has profited of his leſſons, has ſhown itſelf worthy of having him at once for an inſtructor and a model.</p>
                  <p>In ſelecting me for the interpreter of its wiſhes, it has declared, that it is leſs to the talents of an orator, than the patriotiſm of a citizen, the zeal of a preacher of liberty, and the ſenſibility of a friend of men, that it hath confided this ſolemn function. In this point of view, I may ſpeak with firm confidence; for I have the public opinion, and the teſtimony of my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to ſecond my wiſhes. Since nothing elſe is wanting than freedom, and ſenſibility, for that ſpecies of eloquence which this eulogium requires, I am ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; for I already poſſeſs them.</p>
                  <p>My voice ſhall extend to France, to America, to poſterity. I am now to do juſtice to a great man, the founder of tranſatlantic freedom; I am to praiſe him in the name of the mother city of French liberty. I myſelf alſo am a man; I am a freeman; I poſſeſs the ſuffrages of my fellow-citizens: this is enough; my diſcourſe ſhall be immortal.</p>
                  <p>The academies, the philoſophical ſocieties, the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſſociations which have done themſelves honor by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the name of Franklin in their records, can beſt appreciate the debt due to his genius, for having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the power of man over nature, and preſented new and ſublime ideas, in a ſtyle ſimple as truth, and pure as light.</p>
                  <p>It is not the naturaliſt and the philoſopher that the orator of the Commons of Paris ought to deſcribe; it is the <hi>man,</hi> who hath accelerated the progreſs of ſocial order; it is the <hi>legiſlator,</hi> who hath prepared the lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty of nations!</p>
                  <p>Franklin, in his periodical works, which had prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious circulation on the continent of America, laid the ſacred foundations of ſocial morality. He was no leſs inimitable in the developements of the ſame morality,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:031827_0064_0FEEC35ED09A9858"/>
when applied to the duties of friendſhip, general char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, the employment of one's time, the happineſs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant upon good works, the neceſſary combination of private with public welfare, the propriety and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of induſtry; and to that happy ſtate which puts us at eaſe with ſociety and with ourſelves. The prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erbs of "Old Henry," and "Poor Richard," are in the hands both of the learned and the ignorant; they contain the moſt ſublime morality, reduced to popular language and common comprehenſion; and form the catechiſm of happineſs for all mankind.</p>
                  <p>Franklin was too great a moraliſt, and too well acquainted with human affairs, not to perceive that women were the arbiters of manners. He ſtrove to perfect their empire; and accordingly engaged them to adorn the ſceptre of virtue with their graces. It is in their power to excite courage; to overthrow vice, by means of their diſdain; to kindle civiſm, and to light up in every heart the holy love of our country.</p>
                  <p>His daughter, who was opulent and honored with the public eſteem, helped to manufacture and to make up the clothing for the army with her own hands; and ſpread abroad a noble emulation among the female citizens, who became eager to aſſiſt thoſe by means of the needle and the ſpindle, who were ſerving the ſtate with their ſwords and their guns.</p>
                  <p>With the charm ever attendant upon true wiſdom and the grace ever flowing from true ſentiment, this grave philoſopher knew how to converſe with the other ſex; to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It muſt be acknowledged, that, in his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he addreſſed himſelf to minds capable of compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending him.</p>

                     <pb n="67" facs="unknown:031827_0065_0FEEC3B46D58B808"/>Immortal females of America! I will tell it to the daughters of France, and they only are fit to applaud you!

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of the golden age. It was among you that liberty was firſt to have its origin. But the empire of freedom, which is extended to France, is about to carry your manners along with it, and produce a revolution in morals as well as in politics.</p>
                  <p>Already our female citizens, (for they have lately become ſuch) are not any longer occupied with thoſe frivolous ornaments, and vain pleaſures, which were nothing more than the amuſements of ſlavery; they have awakened the love of liberty in the boſoms of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of brothers, and of huſbands; they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged them to make the moſt generous ſacrifices; their delicate hands have removed the earth, dragged it along, and helped to elevate the immenſe amphithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre of the grand confederation. It is no longer the love of voluptuous ſoftneſs that attracts their regard; it is the ſacred fire of patriotiſm.</p>
                  <p>The laws which are to reform education, and with it the national manners, are already prepared; they will advance, they will fortify the cauſe of liberty by means of their happy influence, and become the ſecond ſaviours of their country!</p>
                  <p>Franklin did not omit any of the means of being uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to men, or ſerviceable to ſociety. He ſpoke to all conditions, to both ſexes, to every age. This amiable moraliſt deſcended, in his writings, to the moſt artleſs details; to the moſt ingenuous familiarities; to the firſt ideas of a rural, a commercial, and a civil life; to the dialogues of old men and children; full at once of all the verdure and all the maturity of wiſdom. In ſhort, the prudent leſſons ariſing from the expoſition of thoſe obſcure, happy, eaſy virtues, which form ſo many links in the chain of a good man's life, derived immenſe weight from that reputation for genius which he had
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:031827_0066_0FEEC361ACCD3530"/>
acquired, by being one of the firſt naturaliſts and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt philoſophers in the univerſe.</p>
                  <p>At one and the ſame time, he governed nature in the heavens and in the hearts of men. Amidſt the tempeſts of the atmoſphere, he directed the thunder; amidſt the ſtorms of ſociety, he directed the paſſions. Think, Gentlemen, with what attentive docility, with what religious reſpect, one muſt hear the voice of a ſimple man, who preached up human happineſs, when it was recollected that it was the powerful voice of the ſame man who regulated the lightning.</p>
                  <p>He electrified the conſciences, in order to extract the deſtructive fire of vice, exactly in the ſame manner as he electrified the heavens, in order peaceably to invite them from the terrible fire of the elements.</p>
                  <p>Venerable old man! auguſt philoſopher! legiſlator of the felicity of thy country, prophet of the fraternity of the human race, what ecſtatic happineſs embelliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the end of thy career! From thy fortunate aſylum, and in the midſt of thy brothers who enjoyed in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity the fruit of thy virtues, and the ſucceſs of thy genius, thou haſt ſung ſongs of deliverance. The laſt looks, which thou didſt caſt around thee, beheld America happy; France, on the other ſide of the ocean, free, and a ſure indication of the approaching freedom and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the world.</p>
                  <p>The United States, looking upon themſelves as thy children, have bewailed the death of the father of their republic. France, thy family by adoption, has hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ored thee as the founder of her laws; and the human race has revered thee as the univerſal patriarch who has formed the alliance of nature with ſociety.

                  <head>SELF-CONCEIT. AN ADDRESS, SPOKEN BY A VERY SMALL BOY.</head>
                  <p>WHEN boys are exhibiting in public, the polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or curioſity of the hearers frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces them to inquire the names of the performers. To ſave the trouble of anſwers, ſo far as relates to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, my name is Charles Chatterbox. I was born in this town; and have grown to my preſent enormous ſtature, without any artificial help. It is true, I eat, drink, and ſleep, and take as much care of my noble ſelf, as any young man about; but I am a monſtrous great ſtudent. There is no telling the half of what I have read.</p>
                  <p>Why, what do you think of the Arabian Tales? Truth; every word truth! There's the ſtory of the lamp, and of Rook's eggs as big as a meeting-houſe. And there is the hiſtory of Sindbad the ſailor. I have read every word of them. And I have read Tom Thumb's Folio through, Winter Evening Tales, and Seven Champions, and Pariſmus, and Pariſmenus, and Valentine and Orſon, and Mother Bunch, and Seven Wiſe Maſters, and a curious book, entitled, Think well on't.</p>
                  <p>Then there is another wonderful book, containing fifty reaſons why an old bachelor was not married. The firſt was, that nobody would have him; and the ſecond was, he declared to every body, that he would not marry; and ſo it we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ook, it gives an account of his marvellous death and burial. And in the appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix, it tells about his being ground over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>, and c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

out as young, and as freſh, and as fair as ever. Then, every few pages, is a picture of him to the life.</p>
                  <p>I have alſo read Robinſon Cruſoe, and Reynard the fox, and Moll Flanders; and I have read twelve delightful novels, and Iriſh Rogues, and Life of Saint Patrick, and Philip Quarle, and Conjurer Crop, and Aeſop's Fables, and Laugh and be fat, and Toby Lump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins' Elegy on the Birth of a Child, and a Comedy or the Death of his Brother, and an Acroſtic, occaſioned by a mortal ſickneſs of his dear wife, of which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. This famous author wrote a treatiſe on that Riſe and Progreſs of Vegetation; and a whole Bod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I have read all the works of Pero Gilpin, whoſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> rare lad. Why, he could ſtand on his head, as if it were a real pedeſtal; his feet he uſed for drumſticks. He was trumpeter to the foot guards in Queen Betty's time; and if he had not blown his breath away, might have lived to this day.</p>
                  <p>Then, I have read the hiſtory of a man who married for money, and of a woman that would wear her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band's ſmall-clothes in ſpite of him; and I have read four books of riddles and rebuſes; and all that is not half a quarter.</p>
                  <p>Now what ſignifies reading ſo much if one can't tell of it? In thinking over theſe things, I am ſometimes ſo loſt in company, that I don't hear any thing that is ſaid, till ſome one pops out that witty ſaying, "A penny for your thoughts." Then I ſay, to be ſure, I was thinking of a book I had been reading. Once, in this mood, I came very near ſwallowing my cup and ſaucer; and another time, was upon the very point of taking down a punch-bowl, that held a gallon. Now if I could fairly have gotten them down, they would not have hurt me a jot; for my mind is capacious enough for a china-ſhop. There is no choaking a man of my reading. Why, if my mind can contain Genii and
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:031827_0070_0FEEC367CE865A70"/>
Giants, ſixty feet high, and enchanted caſtles, why not a punch-bowl, and a whole tea-board?</p>
                  <p>It was always conjectured that I ſhould be a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous great man; and I believe, as much as I do the Spaniſh war, that I ſhall be a perfect Brobdingnag in time.</p>
                  <p>Well now, do you ſee, when I have read a book, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o right off into the company of the ladies; for they are the judges whether a man knows any thing or not. Then I bring on a ſubject which will ſhow my parts to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>You muſt know, moreover, that I have learned a great deal of wit. I was the firſt man who invented all that people ſay about cold tongues, and warm <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <head>ORATION DELIVERED AT PARIS BY CITIZEN CARNOT, PRESIDENT OF THE EXECUTIVE DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RECTORY, AT THE FESTIVAL OF GRATITUDE AND VICTORY, CELEBRATED AT THE CHAMP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DE-MARS,
<date>MAY 29, 1796.</date>
                  </head>
                  <p>IT is at the moment when nature is renovated, when the earth adorned with flowers and dreſſed in green, promiſes new harveſts; when all beings proclaim in their own language, the beneficent intelligence which renovates the univerſe, that the French people aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, on this great feſtival, to render a diſtinguiſhed hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to thoſe talents and virtues of the friends of the country and humanity. What day can better unite all hearts! What citizen, what man can be a ſtranger to the influence of gratitude! We exiſt only through an uninterrupted courſe of beneficence, and our life is but a continual exchange of ſervices.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as born, our eyes, fixed on the heavens, appear already to acknowledge a primary benefactor. Weak, without ſupport, the love of our parents watches over our infancy, and provides for wants continually renewed. They direct our firſt ſteps; their patient ſolicitude aſſiſts in developing our organs; we receive from them our firſt ideas of what we are ourſelves, and of ſurrounding objects. Additional care models our hearts to affection, our minds to knowledge, and our bodies to uſeful labor. It is for our happineſs, that the wiſe have reflected on the duties of man; that the learned have diven into the ſecrets of nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the magiſtrate watches, and that the legiſlator prepares in deliberation protecting laws.</p>
                  <p>Soon we are enabled to be uſeful. Good children, we ſtrew flowers over the age of our parents, and their trembling voice bleſſes us in their laſt moments. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come parents in our turn, we prepare, in the education of our children, the felicity of our declining years;
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:031827_0081_0FEEC3CCD91704F8"/>
and we thus continue in a new generation the chain of benevolence and gratitude. Senſibility is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted within the family circle; the indigent is ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for under the thatch; ſuccours and conſolation are laviſhed; and the donor, at firſt paid for the good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the pleaſure of having performed it, is doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rewarded by the gratitude of the object. Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence! how happy are thy votaries, and how much to be pitied, the ſoul that knows thee not!</p>
                  <p>He who is a good ſon and a good father is alſo a good citizen. He loves his country; renders with alacrity the tribute of ſervices; he delights in return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his brothers the protection he has received from them. Either magiſtrate or warrior, manufacturer or farmer; in the temple of the arts; in the Senate; in the fields of glory, or the workſhops of induſtry, he ſhows himſelf ambitious of contributing towards the proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of his country, and to deſerve one day its grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>You, to whom France owes its political regeneration; courageous philoſophers, whoſe writings have planted the ſeeds of the revolution, corroded the fetters of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and blunted by degrees the ravings of fanaticiſm. You, citizens, whoſe dauntleſs courage effected this happy revolution; founded the republic, and contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe ſeven years againſt crime and ambition, royal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm and anarchy. You all, in a word, who labor to render France happy and flouriſhing; who render it illuſtrious by your talents, and enrich it by your diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries; receive the ſolemn teſtimony of national grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
                  <p>Receive that teſtimony particularly, republican ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; you, whoſe glory and ſucceſſes are freſh in the
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:031827_0082_0FEEC37AAEA56800"/>
recollection of all. It is you who have defended us againſt ten combined kings; who have driven them from our territory; have transferred to their dominions the ſcourge of war. You have not only conquered men; you have overcome the obſtacles thrown in your way by nature. You have triumphed over fatigue, hunger, and winter. What a ſpectacle for the people! what a dreadful leſſon to the enemies of liberty!</p>
                  <p>A new-born republic arms its children to defend its independence; nothing can reſtrain their impetuoſity; traverſing rivers, carrying intrenchments, climbing rocks. Here, after a ſeries of victories, they puſhed back our limits to thoſe barriers that nature intended for us, and purſuing over ice the remains of three ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, transformed an oppreſſed and hoſtile nation into a free and allied people. There they fly to exterminate the hordes of traitors and villains, ſubſidized by En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland; puniſh their thieves, and reſtore to the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic brothers too long miſled. Here, ſurmounting the Pyrenees, and precipitating themſelves from their ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit; overthrowing whatever oppoſes their progreſs, and checked only by an honorable peace; there aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending the Alps and Appenines, they fly acroſs the Po and Adige.</p>
                  <p>The ardor of the ſoldier is ſeconded by the genius and boldneſs of the chiefs. They plan with ſcience, and execute with energy; now diſplaying their forces with calmneſs; then courting danger at the head of their brothers in arms. Oh that I could here diſplay the immenſe and glorious picture of their victories! that I could name our moſt intrepid defenders! What a crowd of ſublime images and beloved names preſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my recollection! Immortal warriors, poſterity will not believe the multitude of your triumphs; but to us hiſtory loſes all its improbabilities.</p>
                  <p>But do we not ſee, even on this ſpot, a portion of thoſe brave defenders? Victors over the exterior ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the ſtate, they have come to repreſs our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal enemies; and preſerve at home the republic
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:031827_0083_0FEEC3D4389B5158"/>
which they have cauſed to be reſpected abroad. Do we not alſo ſee thoſe venerable warriors who have grown grey in the ſervice; thoſe whom honorable wounds have obliged to ſeek premature repoſe, and whoſe aſylum is in ſight? With what pleaſure our eyes feed on this intereſting reunion. With what agreeable emotions we contemplate thoſe victorious brows!</p>
                  <p>Heroes who have periſhed for liberty, why does there remain to us nothing but a recollection of your ſervices? You will, however, live forever in our hearts; your children will be dear to us; the republic will repay to them the debt they owe to you; and we diſcharge here the firſt by proclaiming your glory and our grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude. Republican armies, repreſented here, by war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors from your ranks; invincible phalanxes, whoſe trophies I obſerve on all ſides, whoſe freſh ſucceſſes I foreſee, come forward and receive the triumphal crowns which the French people command me to attack to your colors.</p>

                  <p>When ſhe broke her chains; when ſhe proclaimed the impreſcriptible rights of man; when, in a terrible war, ſhe ſealed with her blood the covenant made with liberty, her own happineſs was not alone the object of her glorious efforts; her views extended alſo to all free people; ſhe ſaw their intereſts blended with her

own, and doubly rejoiced in her victories, which, in aſſuring to her the enjoyments of her rights, became to them new guarantees of their independence.</p>
                  <p>Theſe ſentiments, which animated the French na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the dawn of their revolution, have acquired new ſtrength ſince the foundation of the republic. France, at that time, by the form of its government aſſimilated to, or rather indentified with free people, ſaw in them only friends and brothers. Long accuſtomed to regard the American people as their moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful allies, ſhe has ſought to draw cloſer the ties already formed in the fields of America, under the auſpices of victory over the ruins of tyranny.</p>
                  <p>The National Convention, the organs of the will of the French Nation, have more than once expreſſed their ſentiments to the American people; but above all, theſe burſt forth on that auguſt day, when the Miniſter of the United States preſented to the National Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, the colors of his country, deſiring never to loſe recollections as dear to Frenchmen as they muſt be to Americans. The Convention ordered that theſe colors ſhould be placed in the hall of their ſittings. They had experienced ſenſations too agreeable not to cauſe them to be partaken of by their allies, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that to them the national colors ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Preſident, I do not doubt their expectations will be fulfilled; and I am convinced, that every citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen will receive, with a pleaſing emotion, this flag, elſewhere the terror of the enemies of liberty; here the certain pledge of faithful friendſhip; eſpecially when they recollect that it guides to combat, men who have ſhared their toils, and who were prepared for lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, by aiding them to acquire their own.</p>

                     <p>WELL, my dear, I have warned all the families out of my long range of buildings, and ordered them to pay double the rent they have done, for every day they remain. From every new tenant I am determined to have three times the ſum. The preſent rent will never do in theſe times. Our children will become beggars at this rate; and you and I ſhall have to betake ourſelves to hand labor, like the <hi>common herd,</hi> to earn our daily bread.</p>

                  <head>LORD MANSFIELD'S SPEECH, IN SUPPORT OF A BILL FOR PREVENTING DELAYS OF JUSTICE, BY REASON OF PRIVILEGE OF PARLIAMENT, 1770.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>MY LORDS,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I HAVE waited with patience to hear what argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments might be urged againſt the bill; but I have waited in vain; the truth is, there is no argument that can weigh againſt it. The juſtice and expediency of the bill are ſuch as render it ſelf-evident. It is a propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of that nature, that can neither be weakened by argument, nor entangled with ſophiſtry.</p>
                  <p>We all know, that the very ſoul and e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that there are men, who will not make their regular payments without the compulſive power of the laws. The law then ought to be equally open to all. Any exemption to particular men, or particular ranks of men, is, in a free and commercial country, a ſoleciſm of the groſſeſt nature.</p>
                  <p>I will not trouble your lordſhips with arguments for that which is ſufficiently evident without any. I ſhall only ſay a few words to ſome noble lords, who fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee much inconveniency from the perſons of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants' being liable to be arreſted. One noble lord ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that the coachman of a peer may be arreſted while he is driving his maſter to the Houſe; and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, he will not be able to attend his duty in parliament. If this were actually to happen, there are ſo many ways by which the member might ſtill get to the Houſe, that I can hardly think the noble lord is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in his objection. Another noble peer ſaid, that by this bill we might loſe our moſt valuable and honeſt ſervants. This I hold to be a contradiction in terms: for he can neither be a valuable ſervant, nor an honeſt man, who gets into debt which he is neither able nor willing to pay, till compelled by law.</p>
                  <p>If my ſervant, by unforeſeen accidents, has run into debt, and I ſtill wiſh to retain him, I certainly would pay the debt. But upon no principle of liberal legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation whatever, can my ſervant have a title to ſet his creditors at defiance, while for forty ſhillings only, the honeſt tradeſman may be torn from his family, and locked up in a jail. It is monſtrous injuſtice! I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myſelf, however, the determination of this day will entirely put an end to all ſuch partial proceedings for the future, by paſſing into a law the bill now under your lordſhips' conſideration.</p>
                  <p>I come now to ſpeak, upon what, indeed, I would have gladly avoided, had I not been particularly point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at for the part I have taken in this bill. It has been ſaid by a noble lord on my left hand, that I like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe am running the race of popularity. If the noble
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:031827_0094_0FEEC3E72DEAAB50"/>
lord means by popularity, that applauſe beſtowed by after-ages on good and virtuous actions, I have long been ſtruggling in that race. But if he mean that muſhroom popularity, which is raiſed without merit and loſt without a crime, he much miſtakes in his opinion.</p>
                  <p>I defy the noble lord to point out a ſingle action of my life, where the popularity of the times ever had the ſmalleſt influence on my determinations. I have a more permanent and ſteady rule for my conduct, the dictates of my own breaſt. Thoſe who have foregone that pleaſing adviſer, and given up their mind to be the ſlave of every popular impulſe, I ſincerely pity. I pity them ſtill more, if their vanity leads them to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the ſhouts of a mob for the trumpet of fame. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience might inform them, that many who have been ſaluted with the huzzas of a crowd, one day, have received their execrations the next; and many, who, by the popularity of their times, have been held up as ſpotleſs patriots, have, nevertheleſs, appeared upon the hiſtorian's page, when truth has triumphed over delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the aſſaſſins of liberty.</p>
                  <p>Why then the noble lord can think I am ambitious of preſent popularity, that echo of folly, and ſhadow of renown, I am at a loſs to determine. Beſides, I do not know that the bill now before your lordſhips will be popular. It depends much upon the caprice of the day. It may not be popular to compel people to pay their debts; and, in that caſe, the preſent muſt be a very unpopular bill. It may not be popular neither to take away any of the privileges of parliament; for I very well remember, and many of your lordſhips may remember, that not long ago the popular cry was for the extenſion of privilege; and ſo far did they carry it at that time, that it was ſaid that the privilege protected members even in criminal actions. Nay, ſuch was the power of popular prejudices over weak minds, that the very deciſions of ſome of the courts were tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured with that doctrine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="97" facs="unknown:031827_0095_0FEEC43D31136A60"/>It was undoubtedly an abominable doctrine. I thought ſo then, and think ſo ſtill: but nevertheleſs, it was a popular doctrine, and came immediately from thoſe who were called the friends of liberty; how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly, time will ſhow. Tru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> liberty! in my opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, can only exiſt when juſtice is equally adminiſtered to all; to the king, and to the beggar. Where is the juſtice, then, or where is the law, that protects a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of parliament more than any other man, from the puniſhment due to his crimes? The laws of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try allow of no place, nor any employment, to be a ſanctuary for crimes: and where I have the honor to ſit as judge, neither royal favor, nor popular applauſe ſhall ever protect the guilty.</p>

                  <p>LET us endeavor to realize the majeſty and terror of the univerſal alarm on the final Judgment Day. When the dead are ſleeping in the ſilent grave; when the living are thoughtleſs and unapprehenſive of the grand event, or intent on other purſuits; ſome of them aſleep in the dead of night; ſome of them diſſolved in ſenſual pleaſures, eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage; ſome of them planning or execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſchemes for riches or honors; ſome in the very act of ſin; the generality ſtupid and careleſs about the concerns of eternity, and the dreadful day juſt at hand; and a few here and there converſing with their God, and looking for the glorious appearance of their Lord and Saviour; when the courſe of nature runs on uniform and regular as uſual, and infidel ſcoffers are taking umbrage from thence to aſk, "Where is the promiſe of his coming?" In ſhort, when there are no more viſible appearances of this approaching day, than of the deſtruction of Sodom, on that clear morning in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="98" facs="unknown:031827_0096_0FEEC3E8B54CBEB0"/>
into the ark: then, in that hour of unapprehenſive ſecurity, then ſuddenly ſhall the heavens open over the aſtoniſhed world; then ſhall the alarming clangor break over their heads like a clap of thunder in a clear ſky.</p>
                  <p>Immediately the living turn their gazing eyes upon the amazing phenomenon: ſome hear the long-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſound with rapture, and lift up their heads with joy, aſſured that the day of their redemption is come; while the thoughtleſs world are ſtruck with the wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt horror and conſternation. In the ſame inſtant the ſound reaches all the manſions of the dead; and in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, they are raiſed, and the living are changed. This call will be as ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating to all the ſons of men, as that call to a ſingle perſon, "Lazarus, come forth." O what a ſurpriſe will this be to the thoughtleſs world! Should this alarm burſt over our heads this moment, into what a terror would it ſtrike many in this aſſembly? Such will be the terror, ſuch the conſternation, when it actually comes to paſs. Sinners will be the ſame timorous, ſelf-condemned creatures then as they are now. And then they will not be able to ſtop their ears, who are deaf to all the gentler calls of the goſpel now.</p>
                  <p>Then the trump of God will conſtrain them to hear and fear, to whom the miniſters of Chriſt now preach in vain. Then they muſt all hear; for, "all that are in their graves," all without exception, "ſhall hear his voice." Now the voice of mercy calls, reaſon pleads, conſcience warns; but multitudes will not hear. But this is a voice which ſhall, which muſt reach every one of the millions of mankind, and not one of them will be able to ſtop his ears. Infants and giants, kings and ſubjects, all ranks, all ages of mankind ſhall hear the call. The living ſhall ſtart and be changed, and the dead riſe at the ſound. The duſt that was once alive and formed a human body, whether it flies in the air, floats in the ocean, or vegetates on earth, ſhall hear the new-creating fiat. Wherever the fragments of the human frame are ſcattered, this all-penetrating <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

ſhall reach and ſpeak them into life. We may conſider this voice as a ſummons not only to dead bodies to riſe, but to the ſouls that once animated them, to appear and be re-united to them.</p>
                  <p>This ſummons ſhall ſpread through every corner of the univerſe; and Heaven, Earth, and Hell, and all their inhabitants, ſhall hear and obey.

The duſt is all alive, and in motion, and the globe breaks and trembles, as with an earthquake, while this vaſt army is working its way through, and burſting into life. The ruins of human bodies are ſcattered far and wide, and have paſſed through many, and ſurpriſing transformations. A limb in one country, and another in another; here the head, and there the trunk; and the ocean rolling between.</p>
                  <p>And now, at the ſound of the trumpet, they ſhall all be collected, wherever they were ſcattered; all prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly ſorted and united, however they were confuſed; atom to its fellow atom, bone to its fellow bone. Now methinks you may ſee the air darkened with fragments of bodies, flying from country to country, to meet and join their proper parts:

                           <p>So thought I, Amandar. Theſe were the impreſſions of the moment.

If the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw's motive were our happineſs, all, but my freedom, I would pledge to pay the debt of gratitude. But I would ſooner ſeek the lion's den, or truſt the mercy of a tiger, than commit myſelf to a mercenary Turk. A father's fortune well may tempt the hypocritic ſhow of kindneſs to his ſons.</p>

I believe in my ſhoul, if one were to get rich in a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian country by ſuch a vile trade, the judgments of heaven would keep him poor as long as he lived. Ah, and if men were made to be ſlaves and maſters, why was not one man born with a whip in his hand and gold ſpoon in his mouth; and another, with a chain on his arm, or a fetter to his heel; aye, and without a tongue, or a pair of jaws, ſo long as one muſt not be allowed to uſe them? And if I had known I were to live a dog's life in this hard-hearted country, as I am a Chriſtian, I would have fought ye till I died. But, look ye! all hands upon deck; this muckle arm of mine is free; and by the blood of my heart, it ſhall be torn from my body, before I will be bound once more, it ſhall.</p>

The thought of relieving him from a burden, which his tottering age was unable to ſupport, ſweetened my toil, and made that ſervitude a pleaſure, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had been intolerable. But the generoſity of your family exceeded what I dared to hope. You gratui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly reſtored me to liberty a ſecond time.

                  <opener>
                     <salute>MY LORDS,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I HAVE taken a wide circuit, and treſpaſſed, I fear, too long upon your patience. Yet I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude without endeavoring to bring home your thoughts to an object more immediately intereſting to us than any I have yet conſidered: I mean the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal condition of this country. We may look abroad for wealth, or triumphs, or luxury; but England, my lords, is the main ſtay, the laſt reſort of the whole empire. To this point every ſcheme of policy, whether foreign or domeſtic, ſhould ultimately refer.</p>
                  <p>Have any meaſures been taken to ſatisfy, or to unite the people? Are the grievances they have ſo long complained of removed? or do they ſtand not only unredreſſed, but aggravated? Is the right of free election reſtored to the elective body? My lords, I myſelf am one of the people. I eſteem that ſecurity and independence, which is the original birthright of an Engliſhman, far beyond the privileges, however ſplendid, which are annexed to the peerage. I my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf am by birth an Engliſh elector, and join with the freeholders of England as in a common cauſe. Believe me, my lords, we miſtake our real intereſt as much as our duty, when we ſeparate ourſelves from the maſs of the people.</p>
                  <p>Can it be expected that Engliſhmen will unite heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily in defence of a government, by which they feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inſulted and oppreſſed? Reſtore them to their
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:031827_0118_0FEEC40F186E8828"/>
rights; that is the true way to make them unanimous. It is not a ceremonious recommendation from the throne, that can bring back peace and harmony to a diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people. That inſipid annual opiate has been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered ſo long, that it has loſt its effect. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſubſtantial, ſomething effectual muſt be done.</p>
                  <p>The public credit of the nation ſtands next in degree to the rights of the conſtitution; it calls loudly for the interpoſition of parliament. There is a ſet of men, my lords, in the city of London, who are known to live in riot and luxury, upon the plunder of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, the innocent, the helpleſs; upon that part of the community, which ſtands moſt in need of, and beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the care and protection of the legiſlature. To me, my lords whether they be miſerable jobbers of Exchange Alley, or the lofty Aſiatic plunderers of Leadenhall-ſtreet, they are all equally deteſtable. I care but little whether a man walks on foot, or is drawn by eight or ſix horſes. If his luxury be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the plunder of his country, I deſpiſe and deteſt him.</p>
                  <p>My lords, while I had the honor of ſerving his Maj<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty, I never ventured to look at the Treaſury but at a diſtance; it is a buſineſs I am unfit for, and to which I never could have ſubmitted. The little I know of it has not ſerved to raiſe my opinion of what is vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly called the <hi>monied intereſt;</hi> I mean that blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucker, that m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ck-worm, which calls itſelf the friend of government; that pretends to ſerve this or that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, and may be purchaſed, on the ſame terms, by <hi>any</hi> adminiſtration; that advances money to gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, and takes ſpecial care of its own emoluments.</p>
                  <p>I hope, my lords, that nothing I have ſaid will be under<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>d to extend to the honeſt, induſtrious tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who holds the middle rank, and has given re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated proofs, that he prefers law and liberty to gold. I love that claſs of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n. Much leſs would I be thought to reflect upon the fair merchant, whoſe liberal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:031827_0119_0FEEC469A6C5C418"/>
is the prime ſource of national wealth. I eſteem his occupation, and reſpect his character.</p>
                  <p>My lords, if the general repreſentation, which I have had the honor to lay before you, of the ſituation of public affairs, has in any meaſure engaged your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, your lordſhips, I am ſure, will agree with me, that the ſeaſon calls for more than common prudence and vigor in the direction of your councils. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of the criſis demands a wiſe, a firm, and a pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular adminiſtration. The diſhonorable traffic of places has engaged us too long. Upon this ſubject, my lords, I ſpeak without intereſt or enmity. I have no perſonal objection to any of the king's ſervants. I ſhall never be miniſter; certainly, not without full power to cut away all the rotten branches of government. Yet, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned as I truly am for myſelf, I cannot avoid ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome capital errors in the diſtribution of the royal favor.</p>
                  <p>I know I ſhall be accuſed of attempting to revive diſtinctions. My lords, if it were poſſible, I would aboliſh all diſtinctions. I would not wiſh the favors of the crown to flow invariably in one channel. But there are ſome diſtinctions which are inherent in the nature of things. There is a diſtinction between right and wrong; between whig and tory.</p>
                  <p>When I ſpeak of an adminiſtration, ſuch as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the ſeaſon calls for, my views are large and comprehenſive. It muſt be popular, that it may begin with reputation. It muſt be ſtrong within itſelf, that it may proceed with vigor and deciſion. An adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, formed upon an excluſive ſyſtem of family con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions, or private friendſhips, cannot, I am convinced, be long ſupported in this country.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall trouble your lordſhips with but a few words more. His Majeſty tells us in his ſpeech, that he will call upon us for our advice, if it ſhould be neceſſary in the farther progreſs of this affair. It is not eaſy to ſay whether or not the miniſtry are ſerious in this decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; nor what is meant by the <hi>progreſs</hi> of an affair,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:031827_0120_0FEEC413A6305E00"/>
which reſts upon one fixed point. Hitherto we have not been called upon. But though we are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, it is our right and duty, as the king's great, hereditary council, to <hi>offer</hi> him our advice. The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, mentioned in the noble Duke's motion, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able us to form a juſt and accurate opinion of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his Majeſty's ſervants, though not of the actual ſtate of their honorable negociations.</p>
                  <p>The miniſtry, too, ſeem to want advice upon ſome points, in which their own ſafety is immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. They are now balancing between a war, which they ought to have foreſeen; but for which they have made no proviſion, and an ignominious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſe. Let me warn them of their danger. If they are forced into a war, they ſtand it at the hazard of their heads. If, by an ignominious compromiſe, they ſhould ſtain the honor of the crown, or ſacrifice the rights of the people, let them look to their conſciences, and conſider whether they will be able to walk the ſtreets in ſafety.</p>

                  <head>SOCRATES' DEFENCE BEFORE HIS ACCUSERS AND JUDGES.</head>
                  <p>I AM accuſed of corrupting the youth, and of inſtill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dangerous principles into them, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the worſhip of the gods, as the rulers of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. You know, Athenians, I never made it my <hi>profeſſion</hi> to teach; nor can envy, however violent againſt me, reproach me with having ever ſold my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. I have an undeniable evidence for me in this reſpect, which is my poverty. Always equally ready to communicate my thoughts either to the rich or poor, and to give them entire leiſure to queſtion or anſwer me, I lend myſelf to every one who is deſirous of becoming virtuous; and if amongſt thoſe who hear me, there are any who prove either good or bad, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the virtues of the one, nor the vices of the other,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:031827_0121_0FEEC46DDDF54FC0"/>
to which I have not contributed, are to be aſcribed to me.</p>
                  <p>My whole employment is to perſuade the young and old againſt too much love for the body, for riches, and all other precarious things of whatſoever nature they be, and againſt too little regard for the ſoul which ought to be the object of their affection. For I inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly urge to you, that virtue does not proceed from riches, but on the contrary, riches from virtue; and that all the other goods of human life, as well public as private, have their ſource in the ſame principle.</p>
                  <p>If to ſpeak in this manner be to corrupt youth, I confeſs, Athenians, that I am guilty, and deſerve to be puniſhed. If what I ſay be not true, it is moſt eaſy to convict me of my falſehood. I ſee here a great number of my diſciples: they have only to appear. But perhaps the reſerve and conſideration for a maſter, who has inſtructed them, will prevent them from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring againſt me: at leaſt their fathers, brothers, and uncles cannot, as good relations and good citizens, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe with their not ſtanding forth to demand ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance againſt the corrupter of their ſons, brothers, and nephews. But theſe are the perſons who take upon them my defence, and intereſt themſelves in the ſucceſs of my cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Paſs on me what ſentence you pleaſe, Athenians; but I can neither repent nor change my conduct. I muſt not abandon or ſuſpend a function, which God himſelf has impoſed on me, ſince he has charged me with the care of inſtructing my fellow-citizens. If, after having faithfully kept all the ports, wherein I was placed by our generals, the fear of death ſhould at this time make me abandon that in which the Divine Providence has placed me, by commanding me to paſs my life in the ſtudy of philoſophy, for the inſtruction of myſelf and others; this would be a moſt criminal deſertion indeed, and make me highly worthy of being cited before this tribunal, as an impious man who does not believe the gods.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="unknown:031827_0122_0FEEC3E134BAEAA8"/>Should you reſolve to acquit me for the future, I ſhould not heſitate to make anſwer, Athenians, I honor and love you; but I ſhall chooſe rather to obey God than you; and to my lateſt breath ſhall never renounce my philoſophy, nor ceaſe to exhort and reprove you according to my cuſtom. I am reproached with abject fear and meanneſs of ſpirit, for being ſo buſy in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting my advice to every one in private, and for having always avoided to be preſent in your aſſemblies, to give my counſels to my country. I think I have ſufficiently proved my courage and fortitude, both in the field, where I have borne arms with you, and in the Senate, when I alone, upon more than one occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, oppoſed the violent and cruel orders of the thirty tyrants. What is it then that has prevented me from appearing in your aſſemblies? It is that demon, that voice divine, which you have ſo often heard me men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Melitus has taken ſo much pains to ridicule.</p>
                  <p>That ſpirit has attached itſelf to me from my infancy: it is a voice, which I never hear, but when it would prevent me from perſiſting in ſomething I have reſolved; for it never exhorts me to undertake any thing. It is the ſame being that has always oppoſed me, when I would have intermeddled in the affairs of the republic; and that with the greateſt reaſon; for I ſhould have been amongſt the dead long ago, had I been concerned in the meaſures of the ſtate, without effecting any thing to the advantage of myſelf, or our country.</p>
                  <p>Do not take it ill, I beſeech you, if I ſpeak my thoughts without diſguiſe, and with truth and freedom. Every man who would generouſly oppoſe a whole peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, either amongſt us or elſewhere, and who inflexibly applies himſelf to prevent the violation of the laws, and the practice of iniquity in a government, will never do ſo long with impunity. It is abſolutely neceſſary for him, who would contend for juſtice, if he has any thoughts of living, to remain in a private ſtation, and never to have any ſhare in public affairs.</p>

                     <pb n="125" facs="unknown:031827_0123_0FEEC46F66125A68"/>For the reſt, Athenians, if, in the extreme danger I now am, I do not imitate the behavior of thoſe, who, upon leſs emergencies, have implored and ſupplicated their judges with tears, and have brought forth their children, relations, and friends, it is not through pride or obſtinacy, or any contempt for you; but ſolely for your honor, and for that of the whole city. At my age, and with the reputation, true or falſe, which I have, would it be conſiſtent for me, after all the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I have given upon the contempt of death, to be afraid of it myſelf, and to belie in my laſt action all the principles and ſentiments of my paſt life?</p>
                  <p>But without ſpeaking of my fame, which I ſhould extremely injure by ſuch a conduct, I do not think it allowable to entreat a judge, nor to be abſolved by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications: he ought to be perſuaded and convinced. The judge does not ſit upon the bench to ſhow favor by violating the laws; but to do juſtice in conforming to them. He does not ſwear to diſcharge with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity whom he pleaſes; but to do juſtice where it is due. We ought not therefore to accuſtom you to perjury, nor you to ſuffer yourſelves to be accuſtomed to it; for in ſo doing, both the one and the other of us equally injure juſtice and religion, and both are criminals.</p>
                  <p>Do not therefore expect from me, Athenians, that I ſhould have recourſe to means which I believe nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honeſt nor lawful; eſpecially upon this occaſion, wherein I am accuſed of impiety by Melitus. For, if I ſhould influence you by my prayers, and thereby induce you to violate your oaths, it would be unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niably evident, that I teach you not to believe in the gods; and even in defending and juſtifying myſelf, ſhould furniſh my adverſaries with arms againſt me, and prove that I believe no divinity. But I am very far from ſuch wicked thoughts. I am more convinced of the exiſtence of God than my accuſers; and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that I abandon myſelf to God and you, that you may judge of me as you ſhall think it beſt.</p>

                  <head>MR. SHERIDAN'S SPEECH, AGAINST MR. TAYLOR.</head>
                  <p>WE have this day been honored with the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of a complete gradation of lawyers. We have received the opinion of a Judge, of an Attorney-General, of an Ex-Attorney-General, and of a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing Barriſter. I agree with the learned gentleman in his admiration of the abilities of my honorable friend, Mr. Fox. What he has ſaid of his quickneſs and of his profoundneſs, of his boldneſs and his candor, is literally juſt and true, which the mental accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my honorable friend is, on every occaſion, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to extort even from his adverſaries.</p>
                  <p>The learned gentleman has, however, in this inſidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous eulogium, connected ſuch qualities of mind with thoſe he has praiſed and venerated, as to convert his encomiums into reproach, and his tributes of praiſe into cenſure and invective. The boldneſs he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed is only craft, and his candor, hypocriſy. Upon what ground<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> does the learned gentleman connect thoſe aſſemblages of great qualities and of cardinal defects? Upon what principles either of juſtice or of equity does he exult with one hand, whilſt he inſidiouſly reprobates and deſtroys with the other?</p>
                  <p>If the wolf is to be feared, the learned gentleman may reſt aſſured, it will be the wolf in ſheep's clothing, the maſked pretender to patriotiſm. It is not from the fang of the lion, but from the tooth of the ſerpent, that reptile which inſidiouſly ſteals upon the vitals of the conſtitution, and gnaws it to the heart ere the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief is ſuſpected, that deſtruction is to be feared.</p>
                  <p>With regard to the acquiſition of a learned gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Mr. Taylor, who has declared that he means to vote with us this day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am ſorry to acknowledge, that from the declaration he has made at the beginning of his ſpeech, I ſee no great reaſon to boaſt of ſuch an auxiliary.

                  <p>It is rather ſingular to vote with us, profeſſedly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he finds us to be in the right, and, in the very moment that he aſſigns ſo good a reaſon for changing his ſide, to declare, that in all probability he never ſhall vote with us again. I am ſorry to find the chicken is a bird of ill omen, and that its augury is ſo unpropi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to our future intereſts. Perhaps it would have been as well, under theſe circumſtances, that the chick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en had not left the barn-door of the treaſury; but continued ſide by ſide with the old cock, to pick thoſe crumbs of comfort which would doubtleſs be dealt out in time, with a liberality proportioned to the fidelity of the feathered tribe.</p>

                  <head>PART OF CICERO'S ORATION AGAINST CAT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ILINE.</head>
                  <p>IT is now a long time, conſcript fathers, that we have trod amidſt the dangers and machinations of this conſpiracy: but I know not how it comes to paſs, the full maturity of all thoſe crimes, and of this long-ripening rage and inſolence, has now broken out dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the period of my conſulſhip. Should Catiline alone be removed from this powerful band of traitors, it may abate, perhaps, our fears and anxieties for a while; but the danger will ſtill remain, and continue lurking in the veins and vitals of the republic.</p>
                  <p>For, as men, oppreſſed with a ſevere fit of illneſs, and laboring under the raging heat of a fever, are often at firſt ſeemingly relieved by a draught of cold

water; but afterwards find the diſeaſe return upon them with redoubled fury; in like manner, this diſtemper which has ſeized the commonwealth, eaſed a little by the puniſhment of this traitor, will, from his ſurviving aſſociates, ſoon aſſume new force. Wherefore, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript fathers, let the wicked retire; let them ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate themſelves from the honeſt; let them rendezvous in one place. In fine, as I have often ſaid, let a wall be between them and us: let them ceaſe to lay ſnares for the conſul in his own houſe; to beſet the tribunal of the city praetor; to inveſt the ſenate houſe with armed ruſſians, and to prepare: fire-balls and torches for burning the city: in ſhort, let every man's ſentiments with regard to the public be inſcribed on his forehead.</p>
                  <p>This I engage for, and promiſe, conſcript fathers, that by the diligence of the conſuls, the weight of your authority, the courage and firmneſs of the Roman knights, and the unanimity of all the honeſt, Catiline being driven from the city, you ſhall behold all his treaſons detected, expoſed, cruſhed, and puniſhed.</p>
                  <p>With theſe omens, Catiline, of all proſperity to the republic, but of deſtruction to thyſelf, and all thoſe who have joined themſelves with thee in all kinds of parricide<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> go thy way then to this impious and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable war: whilſt thou, Jupiter, whoſe religion was eſtabliſhed with the foundation of this city, whom we truly call Stator, the ſtay and prop of this empire, wilt drive this man and his accomplices from thy altars and temples, from the houſes and walls of the city, from the lives and fortunes of us all; and wilt deſtroy with eternal puniſhments, both living and dead, all the haters of good men, the enemies of their country, the plunderers of Italy, now confederated in this deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble league and partnerſhip of villany.</p>

                  <p>YOU are precipitated like a torrent from the heights of the Appenines; you have overthrown and diſperſed all that dared to oppoſe your march. Piedmont, reſcued from Auſtrian tyranny, is left to its natural ſentiments of regard and friendſhip to the French. Milan is yours; and the republican ſtandard is diſplayed throughout all Lombardy. The dukes of Parma and Modena are indebted for their political ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence only to your generoſity.</p>
                  <p>The army, which ſo proudly menaced you, has had no other barrier than its diſſolution to oppoſe your invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible courage. The Po, the Teſſen, the Adda, could not retard you a ſingle day. The vaunted bulwarks of Italy were inſufficient. You ſwept them with the ſame rapidity that you did the Appenines. Thoſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes have carried joy into the boſom of your country. Your repreſentatives decreed a feſtival dedicated to your victories, and to be celebrated throughout all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munes of the republic. Now your fathers, your moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, your wives, and your ſiſters, will rejoice in your ſucceſs, and take pride in their relation to you.</p>
                  <p>Yes, ſoldiers, you have done much; but more ſtill remains for you to do. Shall it be ſaid of us, that we know how to conquer, but not to profit by our victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries? Shall poſterity reproach us with having found a Capua in Lombardy? But already I ſee you fly to arms. You are fatigued with an inactive repoſe. You lament the days that are loſt to your glory? Well,

                  <p>But to quiet the apprehenſions of the people, we declare ourſelves the friends of all, and particularly of thoſe who are the deſcendants of Brutus, of Scipio, and thoſe other great men whom we have taken for our models.</p>
                  <p>To re-eſtabliſh the capitol; to replace the ſtatues of thoſe heroes who have rendered it immortal; to rouſe the Roman people entranſed in ſo many ages of ſlavery; this ſhall be the fruit of your victories.

The free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of France, not regardleſs of moderation, ſhall ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to Europe a glorious peace; but it will indemnify itſelf for the ſacrifices of every kind which it has been making for ſix years paſt.

                  <head>REFLECTIONS OVER THE GRAVE OF A YOUNG MAN.</head>
                  <p>HERE lies the grief of a fond mother, and the blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed expectation of an indulgent father. The youth grew up, like a well-watered plant; he ſhot deep, roſe high, and bade fair for manhood. But juſt as the cedar began to tower, and promiſed ere long, to be the pride of the wood, and prince among the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring trees, behold! the axe is laid unto the root;
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:031827_0135_0FEEC48A9EF9DEE0"/>
the fatal blow ſtruck<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and all its branching honors tumbled to the duſt. And did he fall alone? No: the hopes of his father that begat him, and the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proſpects of her that bare him, fell, and were cruſhed together with him.</p>
                  <p>Doubtleſs it would have pierced one's heart, to have beheld the tender parents following the breathleſs youth to his long home. Perhaps drowned in tears, and all overwhelmed with ſorrows, they ſtood, like weeping ſtatues, on this very ſpot. Methinks I ſee the deeply-diſtreſſed mourners attending the ſad ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. How they wring their hands, and pour forth floods from their eyes! Is it fancy? or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>o I really hear the paſſionate mother, in an agony of affliction, taking her final leave of the darling of her ſoul? Dumb ſhe remained, while the awful obſequies were performing; dumb with grief, and leaning upon the partner of her woes. But now the inward anguiſh ſtruggles for vent; it grows too big to be repreſſed. She advances to the brink of the grave. All her ſoul is in her eyes. She faſtens one more look upon the dear doleful object, before the pit ſhuts its mouth upon him. And as ſhe looks, ſhe cries; in broken accents, interrupted by many a riſing ſob, ſhe cries, Farewel, my ſon! my ſon! my only beloved! would to God I had died for thee! Farewel, my child! and farewel all earthly happineſs! I ſhall never more ſee good in the land of the living. Attempt not to comfort me. I will go mourning all my days, till my grey hairs come down with ſorrow to the grave.</p>

                  <opener>
                     <salute>SOLDIERS AND FELLOW-CITIZENS,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THE unjuſt reproaches of our enemies we could eaſily diſprove, if we were not, by our numbers, and by the ſwords which we hold in our hands, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to deſpiſe them. While Ceſar led the armies of the republic againſt the enemies of Rome, we took part in the ſame ſervice with him; we obeyed him; we were happy to ſerve under his command. But when he declared war againſt the commonwealth, we became his enemies; and when he became an uſurper and a tyrant, we reſented, as an injury, even the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors which he preſumed to beſtow upon ourſelves.</p>
                  <p>Had he been to fall a ſacrifice to private reſentment, we ſhould not have been the proper actors in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the ſentence againſt him. He was willing to have indulged us with preferments and honors; but we were not willing to accept, as the gift of a maſter, what we were entitled to claim as free citizens. We conceived, that, in preſuming to confer the honors of the Roman republic, he encroached on the prerogatives of the Roman people, and inſulted the authority of the Roman ſenate. Ceſar cancelled the laws, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the conſtitution of his country; he uſurped all the powers of the commonwealth, ſet up a monarchy, and himſelf affected to be a king. This our anceſtors, at the expulſion of Tarquin, bound themſelves and their poſterity, by the moſt ſolemn oaths, and by the moſt direful imprecations, never to endure. The ſame obligation has been entailed upon us as a debt by our fathers; and we, having faithfully paid and diſcharged
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:031827_0141_0FEEC4DD676B2FC0"/>
it, have performed the oath, and averted the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of failure from ourſelves, and from our poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity.</p>
                  <p>In the ſtation of ſoldiers, we might have committed ourſelves, without reflection, to the command of an officer, whoſe abilities and whoſe valor we admired; but, in the character of Roman citizens, we have a far different part to ſuſtain. I muſt ſuppoſe, that I now ſpeak to the Roman people, and to citizens of a free republic; to men who have never learned to depend upon others for gratifications and favors; who are not accuſtomed to own a ſuperior, but who are themſelves the maſters, the diſpenſers of fortune and of honor, and the givers of all thoſe dignities and powers by which Ceſar himſelf was exalted, and of which he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the entire diſpoſal.</p>
                  <p>Recollect from whom the Scipios<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Pompeys, and even Ceſar himſelf derived his honors; from your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, whom you now repreſent, and from yourſelves, to whom, according to the laws of the republic, we, who are now your leaders in the field, addreſs ourſelves as your fellow-citizens in the commonwealth, and as perſons depending on your pleaſure for the juſt reward and retribution of our ſervices. Happy in being able to reſtore to you what Ceſar had the preſumption to appropriate to himſelf, the power and the dignity of your fathers, with the ſupreme diſpoſal of all the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of truſt that were eſtabliſhed for your ſafety, and for the preſervation of your freedom; happy in being able to reſtore to the tribunes of the Roman people the power of protecting you, and of procuring to every Roman citizen that juſtice, which, under the late uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of Ceſar, was withheld, even from the ſacred perſons of thoſe magiſtrates themſelves.</p>
                  <p>An uſurper is the common enemy of all good citizens; but the taſk of removing him could be the buſineſs only of a few. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in the death of Ceſar, by the rewards and the honors which they beſtowed upon them; and they are now become a prey to aſſaſſins and murderers; they bleed in the ſtreets, in the temples, in the moſt ſecret retreats, and in the arms of their families; or they are diſperſed, and fly wherever they hope to eſcape the fury of their enemies.</p>
                  <p>Many are now preſent before you, happy in your protection, happy in witneſſing the zeal which you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain for the commonwealth, for the rights of your fellow-citizens, and for your own.

                  <p>IT becomes us to learn, not from the Miniſter, but from the Throne itſelf, whether this country is to be governed by men, in whom the Houſe of Commons can confide, or whether we, the People of England's Repreſentatives, are to be the ſport and football of any junto that may hope to rule over us, by an unſeen and unexplorable principle of government, utterly unknown to the Conſtitution. This is the great queſtion, to which every public-ſpirited citizen of this country ſhould direct his view. A queſtion which goes very wide of the policy to be adopted concerning India, about which very wiſe and very honeſt men, not only might, but have, and did materially differ.</p>
                  <p>The total removal of all the executive ſervants of the crown, while they are in the full enjoyment of the
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:031827_0143_0FEEC4E04F9096B0"/>
confidence of that Houſe, and, indeed, without any other viſible or avowed cauſe of removal, than becauſe they do enjoy that confidence; and the appointment of others in their room, without any other apparent ground of ſelection than becauſe they enjoy it not, is, in my mind, a moſt alarming and portentous attack on the public freedom; becauſe, though no outward form of the government is relaxed or violated by it, ſo as inſtantly to ſupply the conſtitutional remedy of oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, the whole ſpirit and energy of the government is annihilated by it.</p>
                  <p>If the Right Honorable Gentleman retain his own opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, and if the Houſe likewiſe retain its own, is it not evident that he came into office without the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant proſpect of ſerving the public? Is it not evident that he has brought on a ſtruggle between executive and legiſlative authority, at a time when they are pointing with equal vigor, unity, and effect, to the common intereſts of the nation?</p>
                  <p>The Right Honorable Gentleman may imagine that I take pleaſure in making theſe obſervations. If ſo, I can aſſure him, upon my honor, that it is far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the caſe. So very far the contrary, that the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies which the country ſuffers at this moment, from the want of a ſettled government, are greatly heightened to my feelings, from the reflection that they are increaſed by his unguided ambition.</p>
                  <p>Our fathers were friends; and I was taught, from my infancy, to reverence the name of Pitt; an original partiality, which, inſtead of being diminiſhed, was ſtrongly confirmed by an acquaintance with the Right Honorable Gentleman himſelf, which I was cultivating with pleaſure, when he was taken from his profeſſion into a different ſcene. Let him not think that I am the leſs his friend, or the mean envier of his talents, becauſe they have been too much the topic of pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyric here already, and both I and the public are now reaping the bitter fruits of theſe intemperate praiſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="146" facs="unknown:031827_0144_0FEEC494AB42FF38"/>"It is good," ſaid Jeremiah, "for a man to bear the yoke in his youth;" and if the Right Honorable Gentleman had attended to this maxim, he would not, at ſo early a period, have declared againſt a ſubordinate ſituation; but would have lent the aid of his faculties to carry on the affairs of this country, which wanted nothing but ſtability to render them glorious, inſtead of ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ting up at once for himſelf to be the firſt.</p>
                  <p>How very different has been the progreſs of my honorable friend who ſits near me; who was not hatched at once into a miniſter, by the heat of his own ambition; but who, as it was good for him to do, in the words of the prophet, "bore the yoke in his youth;" paſſed through the ſubordinate offices, and matured his talents, in long and laborious oppoſitions; arriving, by the natural progreſs of his powerful mind, to a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of political wiſdom and comprehenſion, which this Houſe had long, with delight and ſatisfaction, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged.</p>
                  <p>To pluck ſuch a man from the councils of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the hour of her diſtreſſes, while he enjoyed the full confidence of the Houſe, to give effect to vigorous plans for her intereſts; and to throw every thing into confuſion, by the introduction of other men, introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as it ſhould ſeem, for no other purpoſe than to beget that confuſion, is an evil, which, if we cannot rectify, we may at leaſt have leave to lament.</p>
                  <p>Theſe evils are, however, imputed, by the Right Honorable Gentleman and his colleagues, to another ſource; to the bill for the regulation of the Eaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; from the miſchiefs of which they had ſtepped forth to ſave the country; a language moſt indecent in this Houſe of Commons, which thought it their duty to the public to paſs it by a majority of above one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred; but which was, however, to be taken to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive and dangerous, notwithſtanding that author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; becauſe it had been diſapproved by a majority of eighteen votes in the Houſe of Lords. Some of their opinions I reverence as conſcientious and independent;
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:031827_0145_0FEEC4E37092D850"/>
but the majority of that ſmall majority voted upon principles which the forms of the Houſe will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to allude to, farther than to ſay, that individ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual <hi>Noblemen</hi> are not always <hi>Gentlemen.</hi>

                  <p>THE period for a new election of a citizen to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the executive government of the United States, being not far diſtant; and the time actually arrived, when your thoughts muſt be employed in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignating the perſon, who is to be clothed with that important truſt, it appears to me proper, eſpecially as it may conduce to a more diſtinct expreſſion of the public voice, that I ſhould now appriſe you of the reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution I have formed, to decline being conſidered among the number of thoſe, out of whom a choice is to be made.</p>
                  <p>I beg you, at the ſame time, to do me the juſtice to be aſſured, that this reſolution has not been taken, without a ſtrict regard to all the conſiderations apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to the relation, which binds a dutiful citizen to his country; and that, in withdrawing the tender of ſervice which ſilence in my ſituation might imply, I am influenced by no diminution of zeal for your future intereſt; no deficiency of grateful reſpect for your paſt kindneſs; but am ſupported by a full conv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> that the ſtep is compatible with both.</p>
                  <p>The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which your ſuffrages have twice called me, have been a uniform ſacrifice of inclination to the opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of duty, and to a deference for what appeared to be your deſire. I conſtantly hoped, that it would have been much earlier in my power, conſiſtently with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:031827_0146_0FEEC4978B380648"/>
which I was not at liberty to diſregard, to return to that retirement from which I had been reluctantly drawn. The ſtrength of my inclination to do this, previous to the laſt election, had even led to the prep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aration of an addreſs to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then perplexed and critical poſture of our affairs with foreign nations, and the unanimous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of perſons entitled to my confidence, impelled me to abandon the idea.</p>
                  <p>I rejoice, that the ſtate of your concerns, external as well as internal, no longer renders the purſuit of inclination incompatible with the ſentiment of duty, or propriety; and am perſuaded, whatever partiality may be retained for my ſervices, that in the preſent circumſtances of our country, you will not diſapprove my determination to retire.</p>
                  <p>The impreſſions, with which I firſt undertook the arduous truſt, were explained on the proper occaſion. In the diſcharge of this truſt, I will only ſay, that I have with good intentions contributed towards the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganization and adminiſtration of the government, the beſt exertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not unconſcious, in the outſet, of the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of my qualifications, experience in my own eyes, perhaps ſtill more in the eyes of others, has ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened the motives to diffidence of myſelf: and every day the increaſing weight of years admoniſhes me more and more, that the ſhade of retirement is as neceſſary to me as it will be welcome. Satisfied that if any cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances have given peculiar value to my ſervices, they were temporary, I have the conſolation to believe, that while choice and prudence invite me to quit the political ſcene, patriotiſm does not forbid it.</p>
                  <p>In looking forward to the moment, which is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to terminate the career of my public life, my feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings do not permit me to ſuſpend the deep acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my beloved country, for the many honors it has conferred upon me; ſtill more for the ſtedfaſt confidence with
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:031827_0147_0FEEC4E4F6085238"/>
which it has ſupported me; and for the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifeſting my inviolable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, by ſervices faithful and perſevering, though in uſefulneſs unequal to my zeal. If benefits have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted to our country from theſe ſervices, let it always be remembered to your praiſe, as an inſtructive exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in our annals, that under circumſtances in which the paſſions, agitated in every direction, were liable to miſlead; amidſt appearances ſometimes dubious; viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitudes of fortune often diſcouraging; in ſituations in which, not unfrequently, want of ſucceſs has counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced the ſpirit of criticiſm; the conſtancy of your ſupport was the eſſential prop of the efforts, and a guarantee of the plans by which they were effected.</p>
                  <p>Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I ſhall carry it with me to my grave, as a ſtrong incitement to unceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vows that Heaven may continue to you the choiceſt tokens of its beneficence; that your union and broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly affection may be perpetual; that the free conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which is the work of your hands, may be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credly maintained; that its adminiſtration in every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment may be ſtamped with wiſdom and virtue; that, in fine, the happineſs of the people of theſe States, under the auſpices of liberty, may be made complete, by ſo careful a preſervation and ſo prudent a uſe of this bleſſing as will acquire to them the glory of recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending it to the applauſe, the affection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a ſtranger to it.</p>
                  <p>Though in reviewing the incidents of my adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, I am unconſcious of intentional error; I am nevertheleſs too ſenſible of my defects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. Whatever they may be, I fervently beſeech the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they tend. I ſhall alſo carry with me the hope that my country will never ceaſe to view them with indulgence; and after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, with an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:031827_0148_0FEEC49A64DC0900"/>
abilities will be conſigned to oblivion, as myſelf muſt ſoon be to the manſions of reſt.</p>
                  <p>Relying on its kindneſs in this as in other things; and actuated by that fervent love towards it, which is ſo natural to a man who views in it the native ſoil of himſelf and his progenitors for ſeveral generations, I anticipate with pleaſing expectation that retreat, in which I promiſe myſelf to realize, without alloy, the ſweet enjoyment of partaking, in the midſt of my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-citizens, the benign influence of good laws under a free government; the ever favorite object of my heart, and the happy reward, as I truſt, of our mutual cares, labors, and dangers,</p>

poor people could not bear to ſee a rich man living at his eaſe, or give a nobleman his title. But times are altering for the better, my mamma ſays: the rich be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to govern now. We ſhall ſoon live in ſtyle, and wear titles here as well as in England.

                     <p>Quite enough! I am fully convinced of the juſtice of your claim to the title of Duke, or whatever you pleaſe. About as much merit in it, I perceive, as in your father's title to his eſtate. Ten thouſand dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars drawn in a lottery; already two thirds ſpent. A title to nobility derived from the grandſon of an aunt of 'ſquire Thorn, from 'ſquire Thorn's horſe, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps from ſome monkey, that has been a favorite play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate with the prince of Wales. Theſe are to be the ſupport of your eaſe and honor through life. Well, I believe there is no need of your troubling yourſelf about your future employment: that is already determined. Depend upon it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you will repent of your folly, or ſcratch a poor man's head as long as you live. I adviſe you to ſet about the former, in order to avoid the latter.</p>

Deprived of every thing, you have ſupplied every thing. You have won battles without cannon; made forced marches without ſhoes; watched without brandy, and often without bread. The republican phalanxes, the ſoldiers of liberty were alone capable of ſuffering what you have ſuffered.</p>
                  <p>Thanks be to you, ſoldiers. The grateful country will, in part, be indebted to you for her proſperity; and if, when victorious at Toulon, you predicted the immortal campaign of 1794, your preſent victories will be the preſages of more brilliant victories. The two armies, which attacked you with audacity, fly diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened before you. Men, who ſmiled at your miſery, and rejoiced in thought at the idea of the triumphs of your enemies, are confounded and appalled. But it muſt not, ſoldiers, be concealed from you, that you have done <hi>nothing,</hi> ſince <hi>ſomething</hi> remains yet to be done. Neither Turin nor Milan are in your power. The aſhes of the conquerors of the Tarquins are ſtill diſgraced by the aſſaſſins of Baſſeville.

                     <p>Well, here's the lad that will ſerve them as <hi>cheap</hi> as any man in America; and I believe I may venture to ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                        <hi>well</hi> too; for I profeſs no ſmall ſhare of ſkill in that buſineſs. I have kept ſchool eleven win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and have often had matter of fifty ſcholars at a time. I have teach'd a child its letters in a day, and to read in the pſalter in a fortnight: and I always feel very much aſhamed, if I uſe more than one quire of paper in larnin a boy to write as well as his maſter. As for government, I'll turn my back to no man. I never flog my ſcholars; for that monſtrous doctrine of whippin children, which has been ſo long preached and practiſed by our rigid and ſuperſtitious forefathers, I have, long ſince, exploded. I have a rare knack of <hi>flattering</hi> them into their duty. And this, according to a celebrated Doctor at Philadelphia, whoſe works I have heard of, though I never read them, is the grand criterion of ſchool government. It is, landlord, it is the very philoſopher's ſtone. I am told, likewiſe, that this ſame great Doctor does not believe that Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and others really meant <hi>lickin,</hi> in the proper ſenſe of the word, when they talked ſo much about uſing the rod, &amp;c. He ſuppoſes, that they meant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining them in dungeons; ſtarving them for three or four days at a time; and then giving them a potion of tatromattucks, and ſuch kinds of mild puniſhment. And, zounds, landlord, I believe he's above half right.</p>

the latter part of his time, that he had the frontery to demand <hi>ten dollars</hi> a month, and his board. And he might truly be ſaid to rule with a rod of iron; for he kept an <hi>ir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

I have heard my wife ſay, that Sue Goſſip told her, that ſhe has ſeen the marks of his laſhes on the back of her neighbor Rymple's ſon Darling, for twelve hours after the drubbing. At leaſt, the boy told her with his own mouth, that they <hi>might</hi> be ſeen, if they would only take the trouble to ſtrip his ſhirt off. And, beſides, Maſter Ignoramus, he was the moſt niggardly of all the human race. I don't ſuppoſe that my bar-room was one dollar the richer for him, in the courſe of the whole time which he tarried with us. While the young people of the town were recreating themſelves, and taking a ſociable glaſs of an evening at my houſe, the ſtupid blockhead was et<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The wretch had the dacity to box little Sammy Puney's ears at ſuch an intolerable rate, that his parents fear the poor child will be an idiot all the days of his life. And all this, for nothing more, than, partly by deſign, and partly through mere accident, he happened to ſpit in his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's face. The child being nephew to the ſquire, you may well ſuppoſe, that the whole neighborhood was ſoon in an uproar. The indignation of the mother, father, aunts, uncles, couſins, and indeed the whole cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of acquaintance, was rouſed; and the poor fellow was hooted out of town in leſs than twenty-four hours.</p>

                     <p>Gentlemen, I will give you a ſhort hiſtory of my life. From ſeven, to fifteen years of age, I went to ſchool perhaps as much as one year. In which time I went through Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>worth's Spelling-Book, the Pſalter, the New-Teſtament; and could read the newſpaper without ſpelling more than half the words. By this time, feeling a little above the common level, I enliſted a ſoldier in the army, where I continued ſix years; and made ſuch proficiency in the military art, that I was frequently talked of for a corporal. I had likewiſe larn'd to write conſiderably, and to cypher as fur as Diviſion. The multiplication table I had at my tongue's end, and have not forgot it to this day. At length, receiving a ſevere flogging for nothing at all, I am not aſhamed to own that I deſerted, and went into one of the back ſettlements, and offered myſelf as a teacher. I was immediately employed in that ſervice; and, though I am obliged to ſay it myſelf, I do aſſure you I ſoon became very famous. Since that time, which is eleven years, I have followed the buſineſs conſtantly; at leaſt, every winter; for in the ſummer, it is not cuſtomary in the towns in general, to continue a man's ſchool. One thing I would not forget to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and that is, I have travelled about the country ſo much, and been in the army ſo long (which is allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the beſt ſchool in the world) that I conſider myſelf as being thoroughly acquainted with mankind. You will not be inſenſible, gentlemen, of what great importance this laſt acquiſition is, to one who has the care of youth.</p>

                  <head>EXTRACT FROM MR. PITT'S SPEECH, IN ANSWER TO LORD MANSFIELD, ON THE AFFAIR OF MR. WILKIN, 1770.</head>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>MY LORDS,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THERE is one plain maxim, to which I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably adhered through life; that in every queſtion in which my liberty or my property were concerned, I ſhould conſult and be determined by the dictates of common ſenſe. I confeſs, my lords, that I am apt to diſtruſt the refinements of learning, becauſe I have ſeen the ableſt and the moſt learned men equally liable to deceive themſelves, and to miſlead others.</p>
                  <p>The condition of human nature would be lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble indeed, if nothing leſs than the greateſt learning and talents, which fall to the ſhare of ſo ſmall a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men, were ſufficient to direct our judgment and
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:031827_0164_0FEEC4B1F48465A0"/>
our conduct. But Providence has taken better care of our happineſs, and given us, in the ſimplicity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, a rule for our direction, by which we ſhall never be miſſed.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs, my lords, I had no other guide in drawing up the amendment, which I ſubmitted to your conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration. And before I heard the opinion of the noble lord who ſpoke laſt, I did not conceive, that it was even within the limits of poſſibility for the greateſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man genius, the moſt ſubtle underſtanding, or the acuteſt wit, ſo ſtrangely to miſrepreſent my meaning; and to give it an interpretation ſo entirely foreign from what I intended to expreſs, and from that ſenſe, which the very terms of the amendment plainly and diſtinctly carry with them.</p>
                  <p>If there be the ſmalleſt foundation for the cenſure thrown upon me by that noble lord; if, either expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or by the moſt diſtant implication, I have ſaid or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuated any part of what the noble lord has charged me with, diſcard my opinions forever; diſcard the motion with contempt.</p>
                  <p>My lords, I muſt beg the indulgence of the Houſe. Neither will my health permit me, nor do I pretend to be qualified, to follow that learned lord minutely through the whole of his argument. No man is better acquainted with his abilities and learning, nor has a greater reſpect for them, than I have. I have had the pleaſure of ſitting with him in the other Houſe, and always liſtened to him with attention. I have not now loſt a word of what he ſaid, nor did I ever. Upon the preſent queſtion, I meet him without fear.</p>
                  <p>The evidence, which truth carries with it, is ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to all arguments; it neither wants the ſupport, nor dreads the oppoſition of the greateſt abilities. If there be a ſingle word in the amendment to juſtify the interpretation, which the noble lord has been pleaſed to give it, I am ready to renounce the whole. Let it be read, my lords; let it ſpeak for itſelf. In what inſtance does it interfere with the privileges of the
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:031827_0165_0FEEC5088AECFF40"/>
Houſe of Commons? In what reſpect does it queſtion their juriſdiction, or ſuppoſe an authority in this Houſe to arraign the juſtice of their ſentence?</p>
                  <p>I am ſure that every lord who heers me, will bear me witneſs that I ſaid not one word touching the merits of the Middleſex election. Far from conveying any opinion upon that matter in the amendment, I did not, even in diſcourſe, deliver my own ſentiments upon it. I did not ſay that the Houſe of Commons had done either right or wrong; but when his Maj<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſty was pleaſed to recommend it to us to cultivate unanimity amongſt ourſelves, I thought it the duty of this Houſe, as the great hereditary council of the crown, to ſtate to his Majeſty the diſtracted condition of his dominions, together with the events which had deſtroyed unanimity among his ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>But, my lords, I ſtated thoſe events merely as facts, without the ſmalleſt addition either of cenſure or of opinion. They are facts, my lords, which I am not only convinced are true, but which I know are indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putably true.</p>
                  <p>Do they not tell us, in ſo many words, that Mr. Wilkes, having been expelled, was thereby rendered incapable of ſerving in that parliament? and is it not their reſolution alone, which refuſes to the ſubject his common right? The amendment ſays farther, that the electors of Middleſex are deprived of their free choice of a repreſentative. Is this a fact, my lords? or have I given an unfair repreſentation of it? Will any man preſume to affirm that Colonel Luttrell is the free choice of the electors of Middleſex? We all know the contrary.</p>
                  <p>We all know that Mr. Wilkes (whom I mention without either praiſe or cenſure) was the favorite of the county, and choſen, by a very great and acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edged majority, to repreſent them in parliament. If the noble lord diſlikes the manner in which theſe facts are ſtated, I ſhall think myſelf happy in being adviſed by him how to alter it. I am very little anxious about
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:031827_0166_0FEEC4B90EDA1FC0"/>
terms, provided the ſubſtances be preſerved; and theſe are facts, my lords, which I am ſure will always retain their weight and importance, in whatever form of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage they are deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>The conſtitution of this country has been openly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded in fact; and I have heard, with horror and aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, that very invaſion defended upon principle. What is this myſterious power, undefined by law, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the ſubject; which we muſt not approach without awe, nor ſpeak of without reverence; which no man may queſtion, and to which all men muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit? My lords, I thought the ſlaviſh doctrine of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience had long ſince been exploded: and, when our kings were obliged to confeſs that their title to the crown, and the rule of their government, had no other foundation than the known laws of the land, I never expected to hear a divine right, or a divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility, attributed to any other branch of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature.</p>
                  <p>My lords, I beg to be underſtood. No man reſpects the Houſe of Commons more than I do, or would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend more ſtrenuouſly than I would, to preſerve to them their juſt and legal authority. Within the bounds preſcribed by the conſtitution, that authority is neceſſary to the well-being of the people: beyond that line, every exertion of power is arbitrary, is ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal; it threatens tyranny to the people, and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the State. Power without right is the moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                     </gap>ous and deteſtable object that can be offered to the human imagination: it is not only pernicious to thoſe who are ſubject to it, but tends to its own deſtruction.</p>

                  <p>YOU have now two wars before you, of which you muſt chooſe one, for both you cannot ſupport. The war againſt America has hitherto been carried on againſt her alone, unaſſiſted by any ally whatever. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſhe ſtood alone, you have been obliged uniformly to increaſe your exertions, and to puſh your efforts to the extent of your power, without being able to bring it to an iſſue; you have exerted all your force hitherto without effect, and you cannot now divide a force, found already inadequate to its object.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="173" facs="unknown:031827_0171_0FEEC5112F872CE0"/>My opinion is for withdrawing your forces from America entirely; for a defenſive war you can never think of there. A defenſive war would ruin this nation at any time; and in any circumſtances, offenſive war is pointed out as proper for this country; our ſituation points it out; and the ſpirit of the nation impels us to attack rather than defend. Attack France, then, for ſhe is your object. The nature of the wars is quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the war againſt America is againſt your own countrymen; you have ſtopped me from ſaying againſt your fellow-ſubjects; that againſt France is againſt your inveterate enemy and rival. Every blow you ſtrike in America is againſt yourſelves; it is againſt all idea of reconciliation, and againſt your own intereſt, though you ſhould be able, as you never will be, to force them to ſubmit. Every ſtroke againſt France is of advantage to you: America muſt be conquered in France; France never can be conquered in America.</p>
                  <p>The war of the Americans is a war of paſſion; it is of ſuch a nature as to be ſupported by the moſt powerful virtues, love of liberty and of their country; and, at the ſame time, by thoſe paſſions in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> human heart which give courage, ſtrength, and perſeverance to man; the ſpirit of revenge for the injuries you have done them; of retaliation for the hardſhips you have inflicted on them; and of oppoſition to the unjuſt powers you have exerciſed over them. Every thing combines to animate them to this war, and ſuch a war is without end; for whatever obſtinacy, enthuſiaſm ever inſpired man with, you will now find in America. No matter what gives birth to that enthuſiaſm; whether the name of religion or of liberty, the effects are the ſame; it inſpires a ſpirit which is unconquerable, and ſolicitous to undergo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, danger, and hardſhip: and as long as there is a man in America, a being formed ſuch as we are, you will have him preſent himſelf againſt you in the field.</p>
                  <p>The war of France is a war of another ſort; the war of France is a war of intereſt: it was her intereſt which firſt induced her to engage in it, and it is by that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:031827_0172_0FEEC4C5CF903120"/>
that ſhe will meaſure its continuance. Turn your face at once againſt her; attack her wherever ſhe is expoſed; cruſh her commerce wherever you can; make her feel heavy and immediate diſtreſs throughout the nation: the people will ſoon cry out to their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Whilſt the advantages ſhe promiſes herſelf are remote and uncertain, inflict preſent evils and diſtreſſes upon her ſubjects: the people will become diſcontented and clamorous; ſhe will find it a bad bargain, having entered into this buſineſs; and you will force her to deſert any ally that brings ſo much trouble and diſtreſs upon her.</p>
                  <p>What is become of the ancient ſpirit of this nation? Where is the national ſpirit that ever did honor to this country? Have the preſent miniſtry ſpent that too, with almoſt the laſt ſhilling of your money? Are they not aſhamed of the temporizing conduct they have uſed towards France? Her correſpondence with America has been clandeſtine. Compare that with their conduct towards Holland, ſome time ago; but it is the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtic of little minds to be exact in little things, whilſt they ſhrink from their rights in great ones.</p>
                  <p>The conduct of F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ce is called clandeſtine: look back but a year ago to a letter from one of your Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retaries of State to Holland; "it is with ſurpriſe and indignation" your conduct is ſeen, in ſomething done by a petty governor of an iſland, while they affect to call the meaſures of France clandeſtine. This is the way that miniſters ſupport the character of the nation, and the national honor and glory. But look again how that ſame Holland is ſpoken of to-day. Even in your correſpondence with her your littleneſs appears.</p>
                  <p>From this you may judge of your ſituation; from this you may know what a ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She will never continue your ally, when you meanly crouch to France, and do not dare to ſtir in your defence! But it is nothing extraordinary that ſhe ſhould not, while you keep the miniſters you

This conjurer, in my opinion, is much leſs: I conſider him beneath contempt.

This impoſtor, to maintain the credit of a conjurer, was to inform the owners, on inquiry, where they were, upon their paying him for the impoſition. I have been ſo fortunate as to ſecure one of the partners in this trade. And as I heard this gentleman, for whom you have ſo much regard, had taken up lodgings at your houſe, I did not chooſe to interrupt you till there was full proof of his guilt.

the firſt advances to concord, to peace and happineſs: for it is your true dignity, to act with prudence and juſtice. That <hi>you</hi> ſhould firſt concede, is obvious from ſound and rational policy. Conceſſion comes with bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter grace, and more ſalutary effects from ſuperior pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; it reconciles ſuperiority of power with the feelings of men; and eſtabliſhes ſolid confidence on the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of affection and gratitude.</p>
                  <p>Every motive, therefore, of juſtice and of policy, of dignity and of prudence, urges you to allay the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in America, by a removal of your troops from Boſton; by a repeal of your acts of parliament; and by demonſtration of amicable diſpoſitions towards your colonies. On the other hand, every danger and every hazard impend, to deter you from perſeverance in your preſent ruinous meaſures. Foreign war hanging over your heads by a ſlight and brittle thread: France and Spain watching your conduct, and waiting for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity of your errors; with a vigilant eye to America, and the temper of your colonies, more than to their own concerns, be they what th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>WHEN I conſider the cauſe, for which we have drawn our ſwords, and the neceſſity of ſtriking an effectual blow, before we ſheath them again, I feel joyful hopes ariſing in my mind, that this day an open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be made for the reſtoration of Britiſh liberty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="186" facs="unknown:031827_0184_0FEEC4D4A30082A0"/>
and for ſhaking off the infamous yoke of Roman ſlavery. Caledonia is yet free. The all-graſping power of Rome has not yet been able to ſeize our liberty. But it is to be preſerved only by valor.</p>
                  <p>You are not to expect to eſcape the ravage of the general plunderers of mankind, by any ſentiment of juſtice in them. When the countries which are more acceſſible have been ſubdued, they will then force their way into thoſe which are harder to be overcome. And if they ſhould conquer the dry land, over the whole world, they will then think of carrying their arms beyond the ocean, to ſee whether there be not certain unknown regions, which they may attack, and reduce under ſubjection to the Roman empire.</p>
                  <p>For we ſee that if a country is thought to be power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in arms, the Romans attack it becauſe the conqueſt will be glorious; if inconſiderable in the military art, becauſe the victory will be eaſy; if rich, they are drawn thither by the hope of plunder; if poor, by the deſire of fame.</p>
                  <p>The eaſt, and the weſt, the ſouth, and the north, the face of the whole earth is the ſcene of their military achievements. The world is too little for their ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and their avarice. Their ſupreme joy ſeems to be ravaging, fighting, and ſhedding of blood; and when they have unpeopled a region, ſo that there are none left alive to bear arms, they ſay they have given peace to that country.</p>
                  <p>Our diſtance from the ſeat of government, and our natural defence by the ſurrounding ocean, render us obnoxious to their ſuſpicions: for they know that Britons are born with an inſtinctive love of liberty: and they conclude that we muſt naturally be led to think of taking the advantage of our detached ſituation, to diſengage ourſelves, one time or another, from their oppreſſion.</p>
                  <p>Thus, my countrymen, and fellow-ſoldiers, ſuſpected and hated as we ever muſt be by the Romans, there is no proſpect of our enjoying even a tolerable ſtate of
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:031827_0185_0FEEC52495FAFBD0"/>
bondage under them. Let us, then, in the name of all that is ſacred, and in defence of all that is dear to us, reſolve to exert ourſelves, if not for glory, at leaſt for ſafety; if not in vindication of Britiſh honor, at leaſt in defence of our lives.</p>
                  <p>But, after all, who are theſe mighty Romans? Are they gods; or mortal men, like ourſelves? Do we not ſee that they fall into the ſame errors and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, as others? Does not peace effeminate them? Does not abundance debauch them? Does not wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs enervate them? Do they not even go to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in the moſt unmanly vices? And can you imagine that they who are remarkable for their vices are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe remarkable for their valor? What then do we dread? Shall I tell you the truth, my fellow-ſoldiers? It is by means of our inteſtine diviſions, that the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans have gained ſuch great advantage over us. They turn the miſconduct of their enemies to their own praiſe. They boaſt of what they have done, and ſay nothing of what we might have done, had we been ſo wiſe, as to unite againſt them.</p>
                  <p>What is this formidable Roman army? Is it not compoſed of a mixture of people from different coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; ſome more, ſome leſs capable of bearing fatigue and hardſhip? They keep together while they are ſucceſsful. Attack them with vigor: diſtreſs them: you will ſee them more diſunited than we are now. Can any one imagine, that Gauls, Germans, and with ſhame I muſt add, Britons, who baſely lend their limbs and lives, to build up a foreign tyranny; can one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine that theſe will be longer enemies than ſlaves? or that ſuch an army is held together by ſentiments of fidelity or affection? No: the only bond of union among them is fear. And whenever terror ceaſes to work upon the minds of that mixed multitude, they who now fear, will then hate their tyrannical maſters.</p>
                  <p>On our ſide there is every poſſible incitement to valor. The Roman courage is not, as ours, inflamed by the thoughts of wives and children in danger of falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:031827_0186_0FEEC4D77ABCC610"/>
the hands of the enemy. The Romans have not parents, as we have, to reproach them if they ſhould deſert their infirm old age. They have no country here to fight for. They are a motley collection of foreigners, in a land wholly unknown to them; cut off from their native country; hemmed in by the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding ocean; and given, I hope, a prey into our hands, without any poſſibility of eſcape. Let not the ſound of the Roman name affright your ears, nor let the glare of gold or ſilver, upon their armour, dazzle your eyes. It is not by gold or ſilver, that men are either wounded or defended; though they are ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a richer prey to the conquerors. Let us boldly attack this diſunited rabble. We ſhall find among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a reinforcement to our army.</p>
                  <p>And what will there be then to fear? A few half garriſoned forts; a few municipal towns, inhabited by worn-out old men; diſcord univerſally prevailing, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by tyranny in thoſe who command, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy in thoſe who ſhould obey. On our ſide, an army united in the cauſe of their country, their wives, their children, their aged parents, their lives. At the head of this army, I hope I do not offend againſt modeſty in ſaying there is a General ready to exert all his abil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, ſuch as they are, and to hazard his life in leading you to victory, and to freedom.</p>
                  <p>I conclude, my countrymen and fellow-ſoldiers, with putting you in mind, that on your behavior this day depends your future enjoyment of peace and lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, or your ſubjection to a tyrannical enemy, with all its grievous conſequences. When, therefore, you come to engage, think of your anceſtors, and think of your poſterity.</p>

If they can but dance a little, fiddle a little, flute a little, and make a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome bow and courteſy, that is ſufficient to make them famous, in this <hi>enlightened</hi> age. Three-fourths of the teachers of thoſe arts, which once were eſteemed moſt valuable, will ſoon be out of employment, at this rate. For my part, I am convinced, that, if I had been a dancing maſter, muſic maſter, ſtage player, or mounte-bank, I ſhould have been much more reſpected, and much better ſupported, than I am at preſent.</p>

                     <p>Why, as to theſe <hi>every-day</hi> branches, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay I feel very anxious about them. The boy reads well now; writes a decent hand; is acquainted with the ground rules of arithmetic, and pronounces the Engliſh language genteelly. He has been a long time under the care of Mr. Honeſtus, our town ſchoolmaſter, who has taught him all theſe things ſufficiently. So that I think any more time devoted to them would be waſted.</p>

                     <p>That I ſhall leave to your diſcretion. But there is one branch, of great importance, which I have not yet mentioned, and to which I would have particular attention paid; I mean the art of ſpeaking. You will find him not deficient in that reſpect; though perhaps it requires as much practice to make one perfect in that, as in any art whatever. He has already learned by heart a great number of pieces, and has acted a part in ſeveral comedies and tragedies with much applauſe. It has been the cuſtom of our maſter to have an exhibition at leaſt once a quarter; and my ſon has always been conſidered as one of his beſt performers. He lately took the part of Jemmy Jumps in the farce called The Farmer, and acted it to univerſal acceptation.</p>

A belief of the exiſtence of God is the true original ſource of all virtue, and the only foundation of all religion, natural or revealed. Set aſide this great luminous truth, eraſe the conviction of it from the heart, you then place vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and vice on the ſame level; you drive afflicted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence into deſpair; you add new effrontery to the marred viſage of guilt; you plant thorns in the path, and ſhed an impenetrable gloom over the proſpects of the righteous.</p>
                  <p>Sin has alienated the affections, and diverted the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of men from the great Jehovah. "Darkneſs has covered the earth, and groſs darkneſs the people." Men have worſhipped the works of their own hands, and neglected the true God, though his exiſtence and perfections were ſtamped in glaring characters on all creation. From the regularity, order, beauty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of this great ſyſtem of things, of which man makes a part; from the uniform tendency of all its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions to their proper ends; the exiſtence of God ſhines as clearly as the ſun in the heavens. "From the things that are made," ſays the text, "are ſeen his eternal power and Godhead."</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Man himſelf is a proof of God's exiſtence: Let us place him before us in his full ſtature. We are at once impreſſed with the beautiful organization of his body, with the orderly and harmonious arrangement of his members. Such is the diſpoſition of theſe, that their motion is the moſt eaſy, graceful, and uſeful, that can be conceived.

Erect in ſtature, man differs from all other animals. Though his foot is confined to the earth, yet his eye meaſures the whole circuit of heaven, and in an inſtant takes in thouſands of worlds. His countenance is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upward, to teach us that he is not like other animals, limited to the earth, but looks forward to brighter ſcenes of exiſtence in the ſkies.</p>
                  <p>Whence came this erect, orderly, beautiful conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the human body? Did it ſpring up from the earth, ſelf-formed? Surely not. Earth itſelf is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active matter. That which has no motion can never produce any. Man ſurely could not, as has been vainly and idly ſuppoſed, have been formed by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous concurrence of atoms. We behold the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act order in the conſtitution of the human body. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der always involves deſign. Deſign always involves intelligence. That intelligence, which directed the orderly formation of the human body, muſt have reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a Being whoſe power was adequate to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of ſuch an effect.</p>
                  <p>Creation ſurely is the prerogative of a ſelf-exiſtent, uncauſed Being. Finite creatures may arrange and diſpoſe, but they cannot create; they cannot give life. It is a univerſal law through all nature, that like pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces like. The ſame laws moſt probably obtain through the whole ſyſtem in which we are connected. We have therefore no reaſon to ſuppoſe that angels created man. Neither can we, without the greateſt abſurdity, admit, that he was formed by himſelf, or by mere ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident. If in the latter way, why do we never ſee men formed ſo in the preſent day? Why do we never ſee the clods of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

There muſt therefore be a God uncauſed, independent, and complete. The nobler part of man clearly evinces this great truth. When we conſider the boundleſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and the inconceivable activity of the ſoul of man, we can refer his origin to nothing but God. How aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhing are the reaſoning faculties of man! How ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing the power of comparing, arranging, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necting his ideas! How wonderful is the power of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination! On its wings, in a moment, we can tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ourſelves to the moſt diſtant part of the univerſe.

There the vallies are clothed in ſmiling green, and the plains are bending with corn. Here is the gentle hill to delight the eye, and beyond, ſlow riſing from the earth, ſwells the huge mountain, and, with all its load of waters, rocks, and woods, heaves itſelf up into the ſkies.

gratify our ſenſes. Who covered the earth with ſuch a pleaſing variety of fruits and flowers? Who gave them their delightful fragrance, and painted them with ſuch exquiſite colors? Who cauſes the ſame water to whiten in the lily, that bluſhes in the roſe? Do not theſe things indicate a Cauſe infinitely ſuperior to any finite being? Do they not directly lead us to believe the exiſtence of God, to admire his goodneſs, to revere his power, to adore his wiſdom, in ſo happily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modating our external circumſtances to our ſituation and internal conſtitution?</p>

whole ſurface of the globe with an agreeable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture of light, ſhade, and colors. But ſtill this air has a ſufficient conſiſtency and ſtrength to ſupport clouds, and all the winged inhabitants. Had it been leſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, it would have intercepted the light. Had it been more rarified, it would not have ſupported its inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants, nor have afforded ſufficient moiſture for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of reſpiration. What then but infinite wiſdom could have tempered the air ſo nicely, as to give it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ſtrength to ſupport clouds for rain, to afford wind for health, and at the ſame time to poſſeſs the power of conveying ſound and light? How wonderful is this element! How clearly does it diſcover infinite wiſdom, power, and goodneſs!</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But when we caſt our eyes up to the firmament of heaven, we clearly ſee that it declares God's handy work. Here the immenſe theatre of God's works opens upon us, and diſcloſes ten thouſand magnificent, ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did objects. We dwindle to nothing in compariſon with this auguſt ſcene of beauty, majeſty, and glory. Who reared this vaſt arch over our heads? Who adorned it with ſo many ſhining objects, placed at ſuch immenſe diſtances from each other, regular in their motions, invariably obſerving the laws to which they were originally ſubjected? Who placed the ſun at ſuch a convenient diſtance as not to annoy, but refreſh us? Who for ſo many ages has cauſed him to riſe and ſet at fixed times? Whoſe hand directs, and whoſe power reſtrains him in his courſe, cauſing him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the agreeable changes of day and night, as well as the variety of ſeaſons?</p>
                  <p>The order, harmony, and regularity, in the revolutions of the heavenly bodies, are ſuch inconteſtable proofs of the exiſtence of God, that an eminent poet well ſaid, "An undevout aſtronomer is mad." In the time of Cicero, when the knowledge of aſtro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

void of all underſtanding. Well indeed is it ſaid, that the heavens declare the glory of God.</p>
                  <p>This great Being is every where preſent. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts all around us. He is not, as we are apt to imagine, at a great diſtance. Wherever we turn, his image meets our view. We ſee him in the earth, in the ocean, in the air, in the ſun, moon, and ſtars. We feel him in ourſelves. He is always working round us; he performs the greateſt operations, produces the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt effects, diſcovers himſelf in a thouſand different ways, and yet the real GOD remains unſeen. All parts of creation are equally under his inſpection. Though he warms the breaſt of the higheſt angel in heaven, yet he breathes life into the meaneſt inſect on earth. He lives through all his works, ſupporting all by the word of his power. He ſhines in the verdure that clothes the plains, in the lily that delights the vale, and in the foreſt that waves on the mountain. He ſupports the ſlender reed that trembles in the bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ze, and the ſturdy oak that defies the tempeſt. His p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence cheers the inanimate creation.</p>
                  <p>Far in the wilderneſs, where human eye never ſaw, where the ſavage foot never trod, there he bids the blooming foreſt ſmile, and the bluſhing roſe open its leaves to the morning ſun. There he cauſes the feath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered inhabitants to whiſtle their wild notes to the liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening trees and echoing mountains. There nature lives in all her wanton wildneſs. There the raviſhed eye, hurrying from ſcene to ſcene, is loſt in one vaſt bluſh of beauty. From the dark ſtream that rolls through the foreſt, the ſilver-ſcaled fiſh leap up, and dumbly mean the praiſe of God. Though man remain ſilent, yet God will have praiſe. He regards, obſerves, upholds, connects, and equals all.</p>
                  <p>The belief of his exiſtence is not a point of mere ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulation and amuſement. It is of inconceivable import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to our preſent, as well as future felicity. But while we believe there is a God, we ſhould be extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly careful to aſcertain, with as much accuracy as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:031827_0200_0FEEC54334E66390"/>
what is his real nature. The moſt prominent fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of this are exhibited in that incomprehenſible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of wiſdom, power, and goodneſs, made in the works of creation. A virtuous man ſtands in a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God which is peculiarly delightful. The divine perfections are all engaged in his defence. He feels powerful in God's power, wiſe in his wiſdom, good in his goodneſs.</p>
                  <p>The vicious man, on the contrary, ſtands in a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to God, which is of all things the moſt dreadful. He is unwilling to know that God has ſufficient wiſdom to ſearch out all his wickedneſs, ſufficient goodneſs to the univerſe to determine to puniſh that wickedneſs, and ſufficient power to execute that determination. A firm belief in the exiſtence of God will heighten all the enjoyments of life, and, by conforming our hearts to his will, will ſecure the approbation of a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and inſpire us with the hopes of a bleſſed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality.</p>
                  <p>Never be tempted to diſbelieve the exiſtence of God, when every thing around you proclaims it in a language too plain not to be underſtood. Never caſt your eyes on creation without having your ſouls expanded with this ſentiment, "There is a God." When you ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey this globe of earth, with all its appendages; when you behold it inhabited by numberleſs ranks of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, all moving in their proper ſpheres, all verging to their proper ends, all animated by the ſame great ſource of life, all ſupported at the ſame great bounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous table; when you behold not only the earth, but the ocean and the air, ſwarming with living creatures, all happy in their ſituation; when you behold yonder ſun, darting an effulgent blaze of glory over the heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, garniſhing mighty worlds, and waking ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſongs of praiſe; when you behold unnumbered ſyſtems diffuſed through vaſt immenſity, clothed in ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, and rolling in majeſty; when you behold theſe things, your affections will riſe above all the vanities of time; your full ſouls will ſtruggle with ecſtaſy, and
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:031827_0201_0FEEC591119C9350"/>
your reaſon, paſſions, and feelings, all united, will ruſh up to the ſkies, with a devout acknowledgment of the exiſtence, power, wiſdom, and goodneſs of God.</p>
                  <p>Let us behold him, let us wonder, let us praiſe and adore. Theſe things will make us happy. They will wean us from vice, and attach us to virtue. As a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the exiſtence of God is a fundamental point of ſalvation, he who denies it runs the greateſt conceivable hazard. He reſigns the ſatisfaction of a good conſcience, quits the hopes of a happy immortality, and expoſes himſelf to deſtruction. All this for what? for the ſhort-lived pleaſures of a riotous, diſſolute life. How wretched, when he finds his atheiſtical confidence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally diſappointed! Inſtead of his beloved ſleep and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility, with which he ſo fondly flattered himſelf, he will find himſelf ſtill exiſting after death, removed to a ſtrange place; he will then find that there is a God, who will not ſuffer his rational creatures to fall into annihilation as a refuge from the juſt puniſhment of their crimes; he will find himſelf doomed to drag on a wretched tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>GUIDED by reaſon, man has travelled through the abſtruſe regions of the philoſophic world. He has originated rules by which he can direct the ſhip through the pathleſs ocean, and meaſure the comet's flight over the fields of unlimited ſpace.

                  <p>By imagination, man ſeems to verge towards crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power. Aided by this, he can perform all the wonders of ſculpture and painting. He can almoſt make the marble ſpeak. He can almoſt make the brook murmur down the painted landſcape. Often, on the pinions of imagination, he ſoars aloft where the eye has never travelled; where other ſtars glitter on the mantle of night, and a more effulgent ſun lights up the bluſhes of morning. Flying from world to world, he gazes on all the glories of creation; or, lighting on the diſtant margin of the univerſe, darts the eye of fancy over the mighty void, where power creative never yet has energized; where exiſtence ſtill ſleeps in the wide abyſs of poſſibility.</p>
                  <p>By imagination he can travel back to the ſource of time; converſe with the ſucceſſive generations of men, and kindle into emulation while he ſurveys the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental trophies of ancient art and glory.

For him the earth teems with riches, and the heavens ſmile with beneficence.</p>

                  <p>THIS is a flying moment; perhaps but ſix weeks left to arreſt the dangers that ſurround us. It is difficult for government, after all that has paſſed, to ſhake hands with defiers of the king, defiers of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, defiers of the people. I am a defier of nobody; but if an end is not put to this war, there is an end to this kingdom. I do not truſt my judgment in my preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtate of health; this is the judgment of my better days; the reſult of forty years attention to America. They are re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>! but what are they rebels for? Surely not for defending their unqueſtionable rights! What have theſe rebels done heretofore! I remember when they raiſed four regiments on their own bottom, and took Louiſburg from the veteran troops of France.</p>
                  <p>But their exceſſes have been great! I do not mean their panegyric; but muſt obſerve, in extenuation, the erroneous and infatuated counſels, which have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed. The door to mercy and juſtice has been ſhut againſt them. But they may ſtill be taken up upon the grounds of their former ſubmiſſion. I ſtate to you the importance of America; it is a double market; a market of conſumption, and a market of ſupply. This double market for millions with naval ſtores, you are giving to your hereditary rival.</p>
                  <p>America has carried you through four wars, and will now carry you to your death, if you do not take things in time. In the ſportſman's phraſe, when you have
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:031827_0213_0FEEC55AD6BF7898"/>
found yourſelves at fault, you muſt try back. You have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nſacked every corner of lower Saxony; but forty thouſand German boors never can conquer ten times the number of Britiſh freemen. They may ravage; they cannot conquer. But you would conquer, you ſay! Why, what would you conquer? the map of America? I am ready to meet any general officer on the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>What will you do out of the protection of your feet? In the winter, if together, they are ſtarved; and if diſperſed, they are taken off in detail. I am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in <hi>ſpring</hi> hopes and <hi>vernal</hi> promiſes. I know what miniſters throw out; but at laſt will come your <hi>equinoctial</hi> diſappointment. They tell you— what? That your army will be as ſtrong as it was laſt year, when it was not ſtrong enough. You have gained nothing in America but ſtations. You have been three years teaching them the art of war. They are apt ſcholars; and I will venture to tell your lordſhips, that the American gentry will make officers enough, fit to command the troops of all the European powers. What you have ſent there are too many to make peace, too few to make war.</p>
                  <p>If you conquer them, what then? You cannot make them reſpect you: you cannot make them wear your doth. You will plant an invincible hatred in their breaſts againſt you. Coming from the ſtock they do, they can never reſpect you. If miniſters are founded in ſaying there is no ſort of treaty with France, there is ſtill a moment left; the point of honor is ſtill ſafe. France muſt be as ſelf-deſtroying as England, to make a treaty while you are giving her America, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of twelve millions a year. The intercourſe has produced every thing to France; and England, poor old England muſt pay for all.</p>
                  <p>I have at different times made different propoſitions, adapted to the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>h they were offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The plan contained in the former bill is now im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable; the preſent motion will tell you where
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:031827_0214_0FEEC5AE84A671E8"/>
you are, and what you have now to depend upon. It may produce a reſpectable diviſion in America, and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity at home. It will give America an option: ſhe has yet made no option. You have ſaid, Lay down your arms, and ſhe has given you the Spartan anſwer, "Come and take them."</p>
                  <p>I will get out of my bed, on Monday, to move for an immediate redreſs of all their grievances, and for continuing to them the right of diſpoſing of their own property. This will be the herald of peace; this will open the way for treaty; this will ſhow that parliament is ſincerely diſpoſed. Yet ſtill much muſt be left to treaty. Should you conquer this people, you conquer under the cannon of France; under a maſked battery then ready to open. The moment a treaty with France appears, you muſt declare war, though you had only five ſhips of the line in England: but France will defer a treaty as long as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>You are now at the mercy of every little German chancery; and the pretenſions of France will increaſe daily, ſo as to become an avowed party in either peace or war. We have tried for unconditional ſubmiſſion; let us try what can be gained by unconditional re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs. Leſs dignity will be loſt in the repeal, than in ſubmitting to the demands of German chanceries. We are the aggreſſors. We have invaded them. We have invaded them as much as the Spaniſh armada in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded England. Mercy cannot do harm; it will ſeat the king where he ought to be, throned on the hearts of his people; and millions at home and abroad, now employed in obloquy or revolt, would then pray for him.</p>

Come, upon the whole, I had better tell it you myſelf; for ſhe'll make ſuch a diſmal ditty of it, that it won't be over this half year. The ſooner we have done with it the better. It will only put you out of ſpirits. You muſt know I was in rather a bad ſcrape at Oxford laſt year—</p>

But, unluckily, uncle grew worſe, and went abroad; and then conſulted with ſome crab of a friend, and that friend, with ſome demagogue of a magiſtrate, and ſo all is now blown. However, we had managed it ſo cleverly, that it coſt them nearly three months to find it out; owing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I muſt confeſs, to poor uncle's cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice, in not making his inquiries before the money was carried off, and he himſelf beyond the ſea. The other particulars Lavinia muſt give you; for I have talked of it now till I have made myſelf quite ſick. Do tell me ſome diverting ſtory to drive it a little out of my head. But, by the way, pray what has carried the old folks to Cleves? Have they gone to tell this ſad tale to uncle Hugh, ſo that I might loſe him too?</p>

Such, my dear brother, as will ſoon bring down his grey hairs with ſorrow to the grave. As for your poor mother, it is quite uncertain whether any of us ever ſee her again, as your much-injured uncle has ſent for her over ſea to attend him in his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and to-morrow ſhe ſets out.

                     <p>O yes, yes; an odd thing of that ſort happens now and then. Mandlebert has ſpirit enough to carry it off pretty well, without being ridiculous; though he is as deep, for his time, as e'er an old fellow of a college. But then this is no rule for others.

While he was reſpected by the learned for his application, he was loved even by the indolent for his candor and kindneſs of heart. And though his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, as you know, was very ſmall, he never ran in debt; and by an exact but open economy, eſcaped all imputation of meanneſs.</p>

                     <p>Yes; but all this is nothing to the purpoſe. My father is no more like other men than if he had been born in another planet; and my attempting to reſemble him would be as great a joke, as if you were to dreſs up in Indiana's flowers and feathers, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect people to call you a beauty. I was born a bit of a buck; and have no manner of natural taſte for ſtudy, and poring, and expounding, and black-letter work. I am a light, airy ſpark, at your ſervice, ladies; not quite ſo wiſe as I am merry. I am one of your ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centric geniuſes; but let that paſs. My father, you know, is firm as a rock. He minds neither wind nor weather, nor fleerer nor ſneerer, nor joker nor jeerer; but his firmneſs he has kept all to himſelf; not a whit

of it do I inherit. Every wind that blows veers me about, and gives me a new direction. But with all my father's firmneſs and knowledge, I very much doubt whether he knows any thing of real life.

                     <p>My dear ſiſters, I am convinced. Your words have pierced my very ſoul. I am now wretched, and I deſerve to be ſo. I am determined from this moment to begin my reformation, and, with the aſſiſtance of Heaven, to complete it. Never more will I ſee my vile companions, who have enticed me to go ſuch lengths in wickedneſs. What do I not owe to my amiable ſiſters for their friendly and ſeaſonable advice! I will go directly to my father, and, like the prodigal ſon, fall on my knees before him, beg his forgiveneſs, and put myſelf entirely under his direction and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, ſo long as I live, I never will offend him again.</p>

                  <head>EXTRACT FROM A SPEECH IN CONGRESS,
<date>APRIL, 1796,</date>
ON THE SUBJECT OF THE TREATY WITH GREAT-BRITAIN.</head>
                  <p>IF any, againſt all theſe proofs which have been offered, ſhould maintain that the peace with the Indians will be ſtable without the weſtern poſts, to them I will urge another reply. From arguments cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to produce conviction, I will appeal directly to the hearts of thoſe who hear me, and aſk whether it is not already planted there? I reſort eſpecially to the convictions of the Weſtern gentlemen, whether, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing no Poſts and no Treaty, the ſettlers will remain in ſecurity? Can they take it upon them to ſay, that an Indian peace, under theſe circumſtances, will prove firm? No, Sir, it will not be peace but a ſword; it will be no better than a lure to draw victims within the reach of the tomahawk.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="231" facs="unknown:031827_0229_0FEEC585736FB980"/>On this theme, my emotions are unutterable. If I could find words for them, if my powers bore any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to my zeal, I would ſwell my voice to ſuch a note of remonſtrance, it ſhould reach every log-houſe beyond the mountains. I would ſay to the inhabitants, Wake from your falſe ſecurity. Your cruel dangers, your more cruel apprehenſions are ſoon to be renewed. The wounds, yet unhealed, are to be torn open again. In the day time, your path through the woods will be ambuſhed. The darkneſs of midnight will glitter with the blaze of your dwellings. You are a father; the blood of your ſons ſhall fatten your cornfield. You are a mother; the war hoop ſhall wake the ſleep of the cradle.</p>
                  <p>On this ſubject you need not ſuſpect any deception on your feelings. It is a ſpectacle of horror which cannot be overdrawn. If you have nature in your hearts, they will ſpeak a language, compared with which, all I have ſaid or can ſay, will be poor and frigid. Will it be whiſpered that the treaty has made me a new champion for the protection of the frontiers? It is known that my voice as well as vote have been uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly given in conformity with the ideas I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. Protection is the right of the frontiers; it is our duty to give it.</p>
                  <p>Who will accuſe me of wandering out of the ſubject? Who will ſay that I exaggerate the tendencies of our meaſures? Will any one anſwer by a ſneer, that all this is idle preaching? Will any one deny that we are bound, and I would hope to good purpoſe, by the moſt ſolemn ſanctions of duty for the vote we give? Are deſpots alone to be reproached for unfeeling indifference to the tears and blood of their ſubjects? Are republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans unreſponſible? Have the principles on which you ground the reproach upon cabinets and kings no prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical influence, no binding force? Are they merely themes of idle declamation, introduced to decorate the morality of a newſpaper eſſay, or to furniſh pretty top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ics of harangue from the windows of that State houſe?
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:031827_0230_0FEEC5C1A68ACE58"/>
I truſt it is neither too preſumptuous nor too late to aſk, Can you put the deareſt intereſt of ſociety at riſk, without guilt, and without remorſe?</p>
                  <p>By rejecting the poſts, we light the ſavage fires; we bind the victims. This day we undertake to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der account to the widows and orphans whom our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion will make, to the wretches that will be roaſted at the ſtake, to our country, and I do not deem it too ſerious to ſay, to conſcience, and to God. We are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable; and if duty be any thing more than a word of impoſture; if conſcience be not a bugbear, we are preparing to make ourſelves as wretched as our country.</p>
                  <p>There is no miſtake in this caſe; there can be none. Experience has already been the prophet of events, and the cries of our future victims have already reached us. The weſtern inhabitants are not a ſilent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complaining ſacrifice. The voice of humanity iſſues from the ſhade of the wilderneſs. It exclaims, that while one hand is held up to reject this treaty, the other graſps a tomahawk. It ſummons our imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſcenes that will open. It is no great effort of the imagination to conceive that events ſo near are already begun. I can fancy that I liſten to the yells of ſavage vengeance and the ſhrieks of torture. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready they ſeem to ſigh in the weſtern wind; already they mingle with every echo from the mountains.</p>

This inſtrument, however miſrepreſented, affords America that ineſtimable ſecurity. The cauſes of our diſputes are either cut up by the roots, or referred to a new negociation, after the end of the European war. This was ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ing every thing, becauſe it confirmed our neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality, by which our citizens are gaining every thing. This alone would juſtify the engagements of the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. For, when the fiery vapors of the wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered in the ſkirts of our horizon, all our wiſhes were concentered in this one, that we might eſcape the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of the ſtorm. This treaty, like a rainbow on the edge of the cloud, marked to our eyes the ſpace where it was raging, and afforded at the ſame time the ſure prognoſtic of fair weather. If we reject it, the vivid colors will grow pale; it will be a baleful meteor portending tempeſt and war.</p>
                  <p>Let us not heſitate then to agree to the appropriation to carry it into faithful execution. Thus we ſhall ſave the faith of our nation, ſecure its peace, and diffuſe the ſpirit of confidence and enterpriſe that will augment its proſperity. The progreſs of wealth and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is wonderful, and, ſome will think, too rapid. The field for exertion is fruitful and vaſt; and if peace and good government ſhould be preſerved, the acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our citizens are not ſo pleaſing as the proofs of their induſtry, as the inſtruments of their future ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. The rewards of exertion go to augment its power. Profit is every hour becoming capital. The vaſt crop of our neutrality is all ſeed wheat, and is ſown again, to ſwell, almoſt beyond calculation, the future harveſt of proſperity. And in this progreſs, what ſeems to be faction is found to fall ſhort of experience.</p>

                  <head>EXTRACT FROM AN ORATION, PRONOUNCED AT WORCESTER, (MASS.)
<date>JULY 4, 1796;</date>
BY FRANCIS BLAKE, ESQ.</head>
                  <p>IN viewing the cauſes which led to the event of this joyous anniverſary; in tracing the effects which have reſulted to America; in ſearching for the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which impelled to the conteſt; in recalling the feelings which ſupported us in the ſtruggle, it cannot fail to occur to us that the cauſes have not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the limits of our continent; that the effects have extended far beyond the boundaries of our nation; that the glorious example, with electrical rapidity, has flaſhed acroſs the atlantic; that, guided by the ſame principles, conducted by the ſame feelings, the people, who ſo gallantly fought and bled for the ſecurity of our lives and our liberties, are now fighting and bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in defence of their own.</p>
                  <p>On this day, therefore, religiouſly devoted to the conſecration of our independence, it becomes us, as the votaries of freedom, as friends to the rights of man, and bound to ſupport them whenever invaded, to turn our attention, with a grateful enthuſiaſm, to the ſcenes of their ſufferings, their revolt, and their victories. While exulting in the full enjoyment of peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity, ſhall not a tear for the unexampled diſtreſſes of this magnanimous nation, check, for a moment, the emotions of our joy?</p>
                  <p>They have ſworn that they will live FREE or DIE! They have ſolemnly ſworn, that the ſword, which has been drawn in defence of their country, ſhall never be returned to its ſcabbard, till it has ſecured to them vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and freedom. Let us then breathe forth a fervent ejaculation to Heaven, that their vows may be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered; that the cauſe of our former allies may not be
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:031827_0233_0FEEC5726DC076A0"/>
deſerted, till they have ſcourged their invaders; till they have driven them back in confuſion to the regions of terror, from whence they emerged.</p>
                  <p>While we remember with horror the continued effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of blood, which darkened the morning of their revolution, let us not forget that their vengeance was rouſed by the champions of deſpotiſm, whoſe lives have ſince juſtly atoned for the crimes they committed. While we lament the ſanguinary ſcenes, which cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its progreſs, let it not be forgotten that they aroſe from the bloody manifeſto of a band of tyrants, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined for the helli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h purpoſe of again rivetting the chains they had broken.</p>
                  <p>The league of Pilnitz, like the league of Satan and his angels, revolting againſt the Majeſty of heaven, was profeſſedly fabricated, to arreſt forever the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of freedom; to uſurp the dominion of France, and divide the ſpoil among this band of royal plunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Have we not heard, that the noble, the generous, the grateful monarch of the foreſt, that fawned at the feet of Androcles, when remembering his former friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, will ever turn with fury on his purſuers; and when robbed of his whelps, reſts not till his fangs are crimſoned in the blood of the aggreſſor?</p>
                  <p>Shall then the fervor of our friendſhip be abated, by remembering the tranſitory frenzy of a people diſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the enthuſiaſm of freedom, and irritated to madneſs by the dreadful proſpect of loſing what they had enjoyed but for a moment? Let it never be ſaid of us, as of Rome and of Athens, that ingratitude is the common vice of republics. Was it to the crowned monarch, named Louis the Sixteenth, or to the people of France, that we were indebted, for the blood and treaſure that were ſo profuſely laviſhed in our cauſe? Shall then their ſervices be forgotten, in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their momentary exceſſes? Or ſhall we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe our moſt cordial concurrence in the feelings which impel them to the preſent conteſt with the ruffian po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates of Europe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="236" facs="unknown:031827_0234_0FEEC5CB453CBE78"/>Can we doubt, for a moment, which is the cauſe we are bound to ſupport with our ſanction, when we behold the winds and the ſeas, thoſe dreadful miniſters of Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en's vengeance, commiſſioned to advance their progreſs, and deluge their enemies? When we behold Ariel, with his attendant ſpirits, gently hovering over their navies, and wafting then to victory on the boſom of the ocean; while Neptune and Boreas have combined againſt the league of their oppreſſors, to overwhelm in the deep theſe deluded followers of Pharaoh! Have we not ſeen them fed, as with manna from heaven; the waters divided, and the walls of Jericho falling before them, while the fair proſpect of liberty has led them in triumph through the wilderneſs, as a cloud by day, and a pillar of fire by night!</p>
                  <p>AMERICANS! Let us join in a fervent ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the ſacred charters of humanity, which we have once ſealed with our blood, may be forever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from the deadly graſp of tyrants.</p>
                  <p>FRENCHMEN! Be firm, be undaunted in the ſtruggle you have thus miraculouſly ſupported. Evince to the world, now gazing with admiration at your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits in the field of battle, that you have virtue equal to your courage; that you are friends to the friends of humanity; that your arms are nerved only againſt the enemies of man. Let not the ſacred name of LIBER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TY be polluted by the frenzy of licentious paſſions; but may your preſent glorious conſtitution, while it protects your freedom from the unhallowed ravages of tyranny, remain an unſhaken bulwark againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive fury of faction.</p>
                  <p>TYRANTS! Turn from the impious work of blood in which your hands are imbrued, and tremble at the deſperation of your revolting ſubjects! Repent in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth and aſhes. For behold, ye, who have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted up to heaven, ſhall, ere long, be caſt down to hell! The final period of your crimes is rapidly approaching. The grand POLITICAL MILLENNIUM is at hand;
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:031827_0235_0FEEC579CD06CEF0"/>
when tyranny ſhall be buried in ruins; when all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall be united in ONE MIGHTY REPUBLIC! When the four angels, that ſtand on the four corners of the globe, ſhall, with one accord, lift up their voices to heaven; proclaiming PEACE ON EARTH, AND GOOD WILL TO ALL MEN.</p>

                     <p>I had loſt the power, but how the right? I was treacherouſly kidnapped in my own country, when following an honeſt occupation. I was put in chains, ſold to one of your countrymen, carried by force on board his ſhip, brought hither, and expoſed to ſale like a beaſt in the market, where you bought me.

                     <p>It is in the order of Providence that one man ſhould become ſubſervient to another. It ever has been ſo, and ever will be. I found the cuſtom, and did not make it.</p>

                     <p>You cannot but be ſenſible, that the robber who puts a piſtol to your breaſt may make juſt the ſame plea. Providence gives him a power over your life and property; it gave my enemies a power over my liberty. But it has alſo given me legs to eſcape with; and what ſhould prevent me from uſing them?

You treat both your men and beaſt ſlaves better than ſome of your neighbors, becauſe you are more prudent and wealthy than they.</p>

The more generous their natures, the more indignant they feel againſt that cruel injuſtice which has dragged them hither, and doomed them to perpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual ſervitude. You can rely on no kindneſs on your parts to ſoften the obduracy of their reſentment. You have reduced them to the ſtate of brute beaſts; and if they have not the ſtupidity of beaſts of burden, they muſt have the ferocity of beaſts of prey. Superior force alone can give you ſecurity. As ſoon as that fails, you are at the mercy of the mercileſs. Such is the ſocial bond between maſter and ſlave!</p>

                  <p>IF I were to judge from the dead ſilence with which my ſpeech has been received, I ſhould ſuſpect that what I have ſaid was not very palatable to ſome men in this Houſe. But I have not riſked connexions, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared to me by every tie of blood and friendſhip, to ſupport one ſet of men in preference to another. I have hazarded too much, to allow the breath of calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to taint the objects I have had in view, from the part I have taken. Immutable principles, on which the happineſs and liberty of my countrymen depend, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey to my mind the only ſubſtantial boon for which great ſacrifices ſhould be made.</p>
                  <p>And I here avow myſelf the zealous and earneſt advocate for the moſt unqualified emancipation of my catholic countrymen; in the hope and conviction, that the monopoly of the rights and liberties of my country, which has hitherto effectually withſtood the efforts of a part of the people, muſt yield to the unanimous will, to the decided intereſt, and to the general effort of a whole united people. It is from this conviction, and it is for that tranſcendently important object, that, while the noble Lord and the Right Honorable Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, are offering to riſk their lives and fortunes in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a ſyſtem that militates againſt the liberty of my countrymen, I will riſk every thing dear to me on earth.</p>

to the ſtation of a dependant. And, that he may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy friendſhip which his nature never knew, he has ſported with the feelings of a whole nation. Raiſing the cup with one hand to the parched lip of expectancy, he has daſhed it to the earth with the other, in all the wantonneſs of inſult, and with all the aggravation of contempt.</p>
                  <p>Does he imagine, that the people of this country, after he has tantalized them with the cheering hope of preſent alleviation, and of future proſperity, will tamely bear to be forced to a re-endurance of their former ſufferings, and to a re-appointment of their former ſpoilers? Does he, from confidence of long ſucceſs in debauching the human mind, exact from you, calling yourſelves the repreſentatives of the people of Ireland, to reject a bill, which has received the unanimous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of your conſtituents? or does he mean to puzzle the verſatile diſpoſition of this Houſe, on which he has made ſo many ſucceſsful experiments already, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting you between obedience to his imperious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates, and obedience to the will of the people you ſhould repreſent?</p>
                  <p>Or does he flatter himſelf, that he ſhall now ſucceed, becauſe he has ſucceeded in betraying his own country, into exchanging that peace, by which ſhe might have retrieved her ſhattered finances, for a war, in which he has ſquandered twenty times a greater treaſure, in the courſe of two years, than with all his famed economy, he had been able to ſave, in the courſe of ten? for a war in which the prime youth of the world have been offered up, victims to his ambition and his ſchemes, as boundleſs and preſumptuous, as ill-concerted and ill-combined; for a war in which the plains of every nation in Europe have been crimſoned with oceans of blood; for a war in which his country has reaped nothing but diſgrace, and which muſt ultimately prove her ruin?</p>
                  <p>Does he flatter himſelf, that he ſhall be enabled, Satan like, to end his political career by involving the whole empire in a civil war, from which nothing can

I truſt they have not themſelves ſo ſoon forgotten the leſſon they ſo recently learned from America, which ſhould ſerve as a laſting example to nations, againſt employing force to ſubdue the ſpirit of a people, determined to be free!</p>
                  <p>But if they ſhould be ſo weak, or ſo wicked, as to ſuffer themſelves to be ſeduced by a man, to whoſe ſoul, duplicity and fineſſe are as congenial, as ingenuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and fair dealing is a ſtranger, to become the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſupporting a few odious public characters in power and rapacity, againſt the intereſt and againſt the ſenſe of a whole people; if we are to be dragooned into meaſures againſt our will, by a nation that would loſe her laſt life, and expend her laſt guinea, in reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſimilar inſult, if offered to herſelf, I truſt ſhe will find in the people of this country a ſpirit in no wiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to her own.</p>
                  <p>You are at this moment at the moſt awful period of your lives. The Miniſter of England has committed you with your country; and on this night your adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or rejection of this bill, muſt determine, in the eyes of the Iriſh nation, which you repreſent, the Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter of England, or the people of Ireland! And, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you are convinced, you do not repreſent the people of Ireland; although you are convinced, every man of you, that you are ſelf-created, it does not alter the nature of the conteſt; it is ſtill a conteſt between the Miniſter of England and the people of Ireland; and the weakneſs of your title ſhould only make you the more circumſpect in the exerciſe of your power.</p>
                  <p>Fortunately, the views of the Britiſh Miniſter have been detected; fortunately the people of this country ſee him in his true colors. Like the deſperate gameſter, who has loſt his all, in the wildeſt ſchemes of aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizement, he looks round for ſome dupe to ſupply him, with the further means of future projects; and in the
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:031827_0244_0FEEC5E5147A14A8"/>
crafty ſubtleneſs of his ſoul, he fondly imagines, he has found that eaſy dupe in the credulity of the Iriſh nation. After he has exhauſted his own country in a cruſade againſt that phantom, political opinion, he flatters him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf he ſhall be enabled to reſuſcitate her at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of yours.</p>
                  <p>As you value the peace and happineſs of your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; as you value the rights and liberties of the ſoil that has given you birth; and if you are not loſt to every ſenſe of feeling for your own conſequence and importance as men, I call on you this night to make your ſtand. I call on you to rally round the independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of your country, whoſe exiſtence has been ſo artfully aſſailed. Believe me, the Britiſh Miniſter will leave you in the lurch, when he ſees that the people of this nation are too much in earneſt to be tricked out of their rights, or the independence of their country.</p>
                  <p>What a diſplay of legiſlation have we had on this night? Artificers who neither know the foundation on which they work, the inſtruments they ought to uſe, nor the materials required! Is it on the narrow baſis of monopoly and excluſion you would erect a temple to the growing liberty of your country? If you will legiſlate; know, that on the broad baſis of immutable juſtice only, you can raiſe a laſting, beauteous temple to the liberty of your iſland; whoſe ample baſe ſhall lodge, and whoſe roof ſhall ſhelter her united family from the rankling inclemency of rejection and excluſion. Know, that reaſon is that ſilken thread by which the lawgiver leads his people; and above all, know, that in the knowledge of the temper of the public mind, conſiſts the ſkill and the wiſdom of the legiſlator.</p>
                  <p>Do not imagine that the minds of your countrymen have been ſtationary, while that of all Europe has been rapidly progreſſive; for you muſt be blind not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the whole European mind has undergone a revolution, neither confined to this nor to that country; but as general as the great cauſes which have given it birth, and ſtill continue to feed its growth. In vain do

                  <p>As well may they attempt to alter the courſe of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, without altering her laws. If they would effect a counter revolution in the European mind, they muſt deſtroy commerce and its effects; they muſt aboliſh ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery trace of the mariner's compaſs; they muſt conſign every book to the flames; they muſt obliterate every veſtige of the invention of the preſs; they muſt deſtroy the conduit of intelligence, by deſtroying the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the poſt office. Then, and not till then, they and their abuſes may live on, in all the ſecurity which ignorance, ſuperſtition, and want of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But while I would overwhelm with deſpair thoſe men who have been nurſed in the lap of venality and proſtitution; who have been educated in contempt and ridicule of a love for their country; and who have grown grey in ſcoffing at every thing like public ſpirit, let me congratulate every true friend to mankind, that that commerce, which has begotten ſo much independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, will continue to beget more; and let me congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late every friend to the human ſpecies, that the preſs, which has ſent ſuch a maſs of information into the world, will continue, with accelerated rapidity, to pour forth its treaſures ſo beneficial to mankind.</p>
                  <p>It is to theſe great cauſes we are indebted, that the combination of prieſts and deſpots, which ſo long ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannized over the civil and political liberty of Europe, has been diſſolved. It is to theſe great cauſes we are indebted, that no prieſt, be his religion what it may, dares preach the doctrine which inculcates the neceſſity of ſacrificing every right and every bleſſing this world can afford, as the only mean of obtaining eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the life to come.</p>

                     <pb n="248" facs="unknown:031827_0246_0FEEC5E6BB180188"/>This was the doctrine by which the deſpotiſm of Europe was ſo long ſupported; this was the doctrine by which the political popery of Europe was ſupported; but the doctrine and the deſpotiſm may now ſleep in the ſame grave, until the trumpet of ignorance, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition, and bigotry, ſhall ſound their reſurrection.</p>

                  <head>COLONEL BARRE'S SPEECH IN THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT, 1765, ON THE STAMP-ACT BILL.</head>
                  <p>ON the firſt reading of the bill, Mr. Townſend ſpoke in its favor; and concluded with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words: "And will theſe Americans, children planted by our care; nouriſhed up by our indulgence, until they are grown to a degree of ſtrength and opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and protected by our arms; will they grudge to contribute their mite, to relieve us from the heavy weight of that burden which we lie under?"</p>
                  <p>On this Colonel Barre roſe, and anſwered Mr. Town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſend in the following maſterly manner.</p>
                  <p>"They planted by YOUR care!" No; your op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions planted them in America. They fled from your tyranny, to a then uncultivated and unhoſpitable country, where they expoſed themſelves to almoſt all the hardſhips to which human nature is liable; and among others, to the cruelties of a ſavage foe, the moſt ſubtle, and I will take upon me to ſay, the moſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable of any people upon the face of the earth; and yet, actuated by principles of true Engliſh liberty, they met all hardſhips with pleaſure, compared with thoſe they ſuffered in their own country, from the hands of thoſe who ſhould have been their friends.</p>
                  <p>"They nouriſhed up by YOUR indulgence!" They grew by your neglect of them. As ſoon as you began to care about them, that care was exerciſed in ſending
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:031827_0251_0FEEC63B20BDF928"/>
perſons to rule them, in one department and another, who were, perhaps, the deputies of deputies to ſome members of this Houſe, ſent to ſpy out their liberties, to miſrepreſent their actions, and to prey upon them; men, whoſe behaviour, on many occaſions, has cauſed the blood of thoſe ſons of liberty to recoil within them; men promoted to the higheſt ſeats of juſtice; ſome, who, to my knowledge, were glad, by going to a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign country, to eſcape being brought to the bar of a court of juſtice in their own.</p>
                  <p>"They protected by YOUR arms!" They have nobly taken up arms in your defence; have exerted a valor, amidſt their conſtant and laborious induſtry, for the defence of a country, whoſe frontier was drenched in blood, while its interior parts yielded all its little ſavings to your emoluments.</p>
                  <p>And, believe me; remember I this day told you ſo, that the ſame ſpirit of freedom, which actuated that people at firſt, will accompany them ſtill. But pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence forbids me to explain myſelf further. Heaven knows, I do not at this time ſpeak from motives of party heat; what I deliver are the genuine ſentiments of my heart.</p>
                  <p>However ſuperior to me in general knowledge and experience the reſpectable body of this Houſe may be, yet I claim to know more of America than moſt of you, having ſeen and been converſant in that country. The people, I believe, are as truly loyal as any ſubjects the king has; but a people jealous of their liberties, and who will vindicate them, if ever they ſhould be violated. But the ſubject is too delicate, I will ſay no more.</p>

                     <p>LADIES and gentlemen, you have prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably heard of Foote, the comedian: if not, it is out of my power to tell you any thing about him, except this; he had but one leg, and his name was Samuel. Or, to ſpeak more poetically, one leg he had, and Samuel was his name. This Foote wrote a farce, called the Alderman; in which he attempted to ridicule a well-fed magiſtrate of the city of London. This laſt, hearing of the intended affront, called upon the player, and threatened him ſeverely for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. Sir, ſays Foote, it is my buſineſs to take off people. You ſhall ſee how well I can take myſelf off. So out of the room he went, as though to prepare. The Alderman ſat waiting, and waiting, and waiting, and—I have forgotten the reſt of the ſtory; but it ended very comically. So I muſt requeſt of you, to muſter up your wit, and each one end the ſtory to his own liking. You are all wondering what this ſtory leads to. Why, I'll tell you; Foote's farce was called the Alderman, ours is called the Medley; his was written according to rule, ours is compoſed at looſe ends. Yet looſe as it is, you will find it made up, like

Now, words are very harmleſs things; though I confeſs that much depends upon the manner of putting them together. The only thing to be ſettled is, that, if you ſhould diſlike the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you will pleaſe to alter it, till it ſuits you.</p>

                     <p>Then, do not imagine that you poſſeſs any great ſecret. "Keep your tongue between your teeth" is an old proverb, ruſted and cruſted over, till nobody can tell what it was firſt made of. Prudence, indeed, teaches the ſame. So prudence may teach a merchant to keep his veſſels in port for fear of a ſtorm at ſea. But "nothing venture, nothing have" is my proverb. Now, ſuppoſe all the world ſhould adopt this prudence, what a multitude of mutes we ſhould have! There would be an end of news, law-ſuits, politics, and ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. I tell you, Sir, that buſy tongues are like main ſprings; they ſet every thing in motion.</p>

                     <p>But where's a man's dignity, all this time, while his tongue is running at random, without a ſingle thought to guide it?</p>

                     <p>His dignity! that indeed! Out upon parole, where it ought to be. A man's dignity! as though we came into the world to ſupport dignity, and by an

affected diſtance, to make our friends feel their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority. I conſider men like coins, which becauſe ſtamped with men's heads, paſs for more than they are worth. And when the world is willing to treat a man better than he deſerves, there is a meanneſs in endeavoring to extort more from them.</p>

                     <p>But ſhall a man ſpeak without thinking? Did you ever read the old proverb, "Think twice, before you ſpeak once?"</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Steph.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, and a vile one it is. If a man ſpeak from the impulſe of the moment, he'll ſpeak the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his heart; and will probably ſpeak the truth. But if he mind your muſty proverb, there will be more pros and cons in his head, more hams and haws in his delivery, than there are letters in his ſentences. To your ſly, ſubtle, thinking fellows, we owe all the lies, cheating, hypocriſy, and double-dealing there is in the world.</p>

                     <p>But you know that every ſubject has its ſides; and we ought to examine, reflect, analyze, ſift, conſider, and determine, before we have a right to ſpeak; for the world are entitled to the beſt of our thoughts. What would you think of a tradeſman, who ſhould ſend home your coat, boots, or hat, half finiſhed? You might think him a very honeſt hearted fellow; but you'd never employ him again.</p>

                     <p>Now, was there any need of bringing in tail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, coblers, and hatters, to help you out? They have nothing to do with this ſubject. But you don't under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand me. I ſay, if you would never employ ſuch work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men a ſecond time, why ſhould you juſtify a man for turning out his thoughts half finiſhed? The mind la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors as actually in thinking upon, and maturing a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as the body does in the field, or on the ſhop-board. And, if the farmer knows when his grain is ready for the ſickle, and the mechanic, when his work is ready for his cuſtomer, the man, who is uſed to thinking, knows when he is maſter of his ſubject, and the proper

You talk about a man's mind, juſt as if it were a piece of ground, capable of bearing flax and hemp. You have fairly brought forward a ſhop-board, and mounted your tailor upon it! Now I have no notion of any croſs-legged work in my inner man. In fact, I don't underſtand all this proceſs of thinking. My knowledge upon all ſubjects is very near the root of my tongue, and I feel great relief, when it gets near the tip.</p>

                  <head>EXTRACT FROM MR. PITT'S SPEECH,
<date>NOV. 18, 1777,</date>
ON AMERICAN AFFAIRS.</head>
                  <p>I RISE, my lords, to declare my ſentiments on this moſt ſolemn and ſerious ſubject. It has impoſed a load upon my mind, which, I fear, nothing can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move; but which impels me to endeavor its alleviation, by a free and unreſerved communication of my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In the firſt part of the addreſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have the honor of heartily concurring with the noble Earl who moved it. No man feels ſincerer joy than I do; none can offer more genuine congratulation on every acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſtrength to the Proteſtant ſucceſſion: I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore join in every congratulation on the birth of another princeſs, and the happy recovery of her Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>But I muſt ſtop here; my courtly complaiſance will carry me no farther. I will not join in congratulation on misfortune and diſgrace. I cannot concur in a blind and ſervile addreſs, which approves, and endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors to ſanctify, the monſtrous meaſures that have heap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed diſgrace and misfortune upon us; that have broug<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> ruin to our doors. This, my lords, is a perilous and tremendous moment! It is not a time for adulation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The ſmoothneſs of flattery cannot now avail; cannot ſave us in this rugged and awful criſis. It is now ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to inſtruct the throne in the language of truth. We muſt diſpel the deluſion and the darkneſs which envelop it; and d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſplay, in its full danger and true colors, the ruin that is brought to our doors.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>who</hi> is the miniſter; <hi>where</hi> is the miniſter, who has dared to ſuggeſt to the throne the contrary, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtitutional language, this day delivered from it? The accuſtomed language from the throne has been application to Parliament for advice, and a reliance on its conſtitutional advice and aſſiſtance. As it is the right of Parliament to give, ſo it is the duty of the crown to aſk it. But on this day, and in this extreme
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:031827_0261_0FEEC65707813808"/>
momentous exigency, no reliance is repoſed on our conſtitutional counſels! no advice is aſked from the ſober and enlightened care of Parliament! But the crown, from itſelf, and by itſelf, declares an unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble determination to purſue meaſures. And what meaſures, my lords? The meaſures that have produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the imminent perils that threaten us; the meaſures that have brought ruin to our doors.</p>
                  <p>Can the Miniſter of the day now preſume to expect a continuance of ſupport, in this ruinous infatuation? Can Parliament be ſo dead to its dignity and its duty, as to be thus deluded into the loſs of the one, and the violation of the other? To give an unlimited credit and ſupport for the perſeverance in meaſures, which have reduced this late flouriſhing empire to ruin and contempt! "But yeſterday, and England might have ſtood againſt the world: now none ſo poor to do her reverence." I uſe the words of a poet; but though it be poetry, it is no fiction. It is a ſhameful truth, that not only the power and ſtrength of this country are waſting away and expiring; but her well-earned glories, her true honors, and ſubſtantial dignity, are ſacrificed.</p>
                  <p>France, my lords, has inſulted you; ſhe has encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged and ſuſtained America; and whether America be wrong or right, the dignity of this country ought to ſpurn at the officious inſult of French interference. The miniſters and ambaſſadors of thoſe who are called rebels and enemies, are in Paris; in Paris they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the reciprocal intereſts of America and France. Can there be a more mortifying inſult? Can even our miniſters ſuſtain a more humiliating diſgrace? Do they dare to reſent it? Do they preſume even to hint a vindication of their honor, and the dignity of the State, by requiring the diſmiſſal of the plenipotentiaries of America? Such is the degradation to which they have reduced the glories of England!</p>
                  <p>The people, whom they affect to call contemptible rebels, but whoſe growing power has at laſt obtained
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:031827_0262_0FEEC5F5E0920728"/>
the name of enemies; the people with whom they have engaged this country in war, and againſt whom they now command our implicit ſupport in every meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of deſperate hoſtility: this people, deſpiſed as reb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, or acknowledged as enemies, are abetted againſt you; ſupplied with every military ſtore; their intereſts conſulted, and their ambaſſadors entertained, by your inveterate enemy! and our miniſters dare not inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with dignity or effect. Is this the honor of a great kingdom? Is this the indignant ſpirit of England, who, but yeſterday, gave law to the Houſe of Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon? My lords, the dignity of nations demands a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive conduct in a ſituation like this.</p>
                  <p>This ruinous and ignominious ſituation, where we cannot act with ſucceſs, nor ſuffer with honor, calls upon us to remonſtrate in the ſtrongeſt and loudeſt lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of truth, to reſcue the ear of Majeſty from the deluſions which ſurround it. The deſperate ſtate of our arms abroad is in part known. No man thinks more highly of them than I do. I love and honor the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh troops<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I know they can achieve any thing except impoſſibilities: and I know that the conqueſt of Engliſh America is an impoſſibility. You cannot, I ventu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> to ſay it, you CANNOT conquer America.</p>
                  <p>Your armies, laſt war, effected every thing that could be effected; and what was it? It coſt a numerous army, under the command of a moſt able general, now a noble lord in this Houſe, a long and laborious cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, to expel five thouſand Frenchmen from French America. My lords, you CANNOT conquer Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. What is your preſent ſituation there? We do not know the worſt; but we know, that in three campaigns we have done nothing, and ſuffered much. We ſhall ſoon know, and in any event, have reaſon to lament, what may have happened ſince.</p>
                  <p>As to conqueſt, therefore, my lords, I repeat, it is impoſſible. You may ſwell every expenſe, and every effort, ſtill more extravagantly; pile and accumulate every aſſiſtance you can buy or borrow; traffic and

barter with every little pitiful German prince, who ſells his ſubjects to the ſhambles of a foreign power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> your efforts are forever vain and impotent; doubly ſo from this mercenary aid on which you rely. For it irritates, to an incurable reſentment, the minds of your enemies, to overrun them with the mercenary ſons of rapine and plunder; devoting them and their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to the rapacity of hireling cruelty! If I were an American, as I am an Engliſhman, while a foreign troop remained in my country, I NEVER would lay down my arms; NEVER, NEVER, NEVER.</p>

<date>JULY 4, 1794,</date>
IN COMMEMORATION OF AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE.</head>
                  <p>AMERICANS! you have a country vaſt in extent, and embracing all the varieties of the moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lubrious climes: held not by charters wreſted from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing kings, but the bountiful gift of the Author of nature. The exuberance of your population is daily diveſting the gloomy wilderneſs of its rude attire, and ſplendid cities riſe to cheer the dreary deſart. You have a government deſervedly celebrated as "giving the ſanctions of law to the precepts of reaſon;" pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting, inſtead of the rank luxuriance of natural licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs, the corrected ſweets of civil liberty. You have fought the battles of freedom, and enkindled that ſacred flame which now glows with vivid fervor through the greateſt empire in Europe.</p>
                  <p>We indulge the ſanguine hope, that her equal laws and virtuous conduct will hereafter afford examples of imitation to all ſurrounding nations. That the bliſsful period will ſoon arrive when man ſhall be elevated to his primitive character; when illuminated reaſon and regulated liberty ſhall once more exhibit him in the image of his Maker; when all the inhabitants of the globe ſhall be freemen and fellow-citizens, and patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm itſelf be loſt in univerſal philanthropy. Then ſhall volumes of incenſe inceſſantly roll from altars inſcribed to liberty. Then ſhall the innumerable varieties of the human race unitedly "worſhip in her ſacred temple, whoſe pillars ſhall reſt on the remoteſt corners of the earth, and whoſe arch will be the vault of heaven."</p>

                     <p>I believe we ſhall not make peace by our talks. If the contention is, Who has the moſt humanity, let him who made us judge. We have no pretenſions to ſuperior knowledge; we aſk, Who knows beſt how to uſe what they have? If we contend for power, our arms muſt decide: the leaves muſt wither on the tree of peace; we ſhall cut it down with the battle-axe, and ſtain the green graſs that grows under it with your blood.</p>

Break not into our houſes in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs hours of ſleep. Let no more of our inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent friends be dragged from their protectors and driven into the inhoſpitable wilderneſs; or what is ſtill more inhuman, fall victims to your unrelenting barbarity! If you prefer war, we ſhall drive its horrors into your

                     <p>We love peace; we love our friends; we love all men, as much as you. When your fathers came over the big water, we treated them as brothers: they had nothing: peace and plenty were among us. All the land was ours, from the eaſt to the weſt water; from the mountains of ſnow in the north, to the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing path of the ſun in the ſouth. They were made welcome to our land and to all we poſſeſſed. To talk like White Men, they were beggars and we their ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efactors: they were tenants at will, and we their land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords. But we nouriſhed a viper in our boſoms. You have poiſoned us by your luxury; ſpread contention among us by your ſubtlety, and death by your treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery. The Indians have but two predominant paſſions, friendſhip and revenge. Deal with us as friends, and you may fiſh in our rivers or hunt in our foreſts. Treat us not like ſervants; we ſhall never own you as maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. If you provoke us, our vengeance will purſue you. We ſhall drink your blood; you may ſpill ours. We had rather die in honorable war, than live in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honorable peace.</p>

                  <p>THAT the beſt way for a great empire to tax her colonies is to confer benefits upon them, and, that no rulers have a right to levy contributions upon the property, or exact the ſervices of their ſubjects, without their own, or the conſent of their immediate repreſentatives, were principles never recognized by the miniſtry and parliament of Great-Britain.

tranſient energy of intoxicated rage was exhibited in their every act, and blackened and diſtorted the features of their national character.</p>
                  <p>On the contrary, Americans had but one object in view, for in Independence are concentrated and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed every bleſſing that makes life deſirable, every right and every privilege which can tend to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or ſecure the native dignity of man.

The intrepidity and magnanimity of their armies; the wiſdom and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible firmneſs of their Congreſs; the ardency of their patriotiſm; their unrepining patience, when aſſailed by dangers and perplexed with aggravated misfortunes, have long and deſervedly employed the pen of pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyric and the tongue of eulogy.</p>
                  <p>Through the whole revolutionary conflict, a conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and ſyſtematic regularity were preſerved, equally honorable as extraordinary. The unity of deſign and claſſically correct arrangement of the ſeries of incidents which completed the Epic ſtory of American Independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, were ſo wonderful, ſo well wrought, that political Hypercriticiſm was abaſhed at the mighty production, and forced to join her ſiſter Envy, in applauding the glorious compoſition.</p>

The feelings which inſpired them in the "times which tried men's ſouls," are communicated to our boſoms. We catch the divine ſpirit which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled them to bid defiance to the congregated hoſt of deſpots.

In ſhort, I would be a gentleman farmer; too well informed to be influenced by your railing newſpaper politics; too much delighted with the bleating and playing of the flocks in my own paſture, to read the head of <hi>Theatricals,</hi> or be amuſed with any drove of ſtage-players, that have infeſted our country from Charleſton to Portſmouth. And I ſhould be much more proud of raiſing one likely calf, than as many of the moſt inſipid of all animals, called <hi>Tippies,</hi> as could ſtand in every ſhop in Cornhill.</p>

                  <p>Eloquence conſiſts in a capacity of expreſſing, by the voice, attitude, geſture, and countenance the emotions of the heart. To this art, Demoſthenes and Cicero owe their immortality; by this, the late Earl of Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham gained his celebrity; and to this, are the great pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iticians, now in Europe, indebted for their diſtinction. Eloquent men begin to be heard with attention in our Congreſs; pulpit orators gain crowds, and eloquent lawyers gain cauſes.</p>
                  <p>When the enlightened Stateſman is diſcuſſing the intereſts of a country, on which are grafted his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, fame, and life, he <hi>muſt</hi> be eloquent.

When the compaſſionate lawyer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hope of reward, advocates the cauſe of the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing widow, or injured orphan, he <hi>muſt</hi> be eloquent.</p>
                  <p>But when true Eloquence is introduced into the ſacred deſk, how elevated is the ſubject of the paſſion on the croſs! With what animating zeal can the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er call on h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>May we now look back and trace the progreſs and influence of Eloquence on different ſubjects, and at

various periods? How do we feel its power, when we hear David expreſſing the appearing of the Higheſt! "He bowed the heavens alſo, and came down, and darkneſs was under his feet; he rode upon a cherub, and did fly, and he was ſeen upon the wings of the wind."</p>
                  <p>Who can hear, without emotion, the ſublime elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the prophet Iſaiah, when he announces the future glory of the Church? "Violence ſhall no more be heard in thy land; waſting nor deſtruction with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thy borders: but thou ſhalt call thy walls, Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and thy gates Praiſe."</p>
                  <p>But in what language has the prophet Habakkuk deſcribed the majeſty of the Creator? "Before him went the peſtilence, and burning coals went forth at his feet: he ſtood, and meaſured the earth: he beheld, and drove aſunder the nations: the everlaſting moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains were ſcattered: the perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlaſting." Let us paſs in reſpectful ſilence the eloquence of him, who "ſpake, as never man ſpake."</p>
                  <p>But our attention is immediately arreſted by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Paul before Agrippa; in which he deſcribes a light from heaven, above the brightneſs of the mid-day ſun; when he declares his converſion, and commiſſion to be a miniſter, and a witneſs of thoſe things, which he had ſeen, and of thoſe things, in which the Saviour would appear unto him. "Whereupon," ſays he, "O king Agrippa, I was not diſobedient unto the heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enly viſion."</p>
                  <p>Nor can we fail to mention that eloquence, which made Felix tremble on his throne. Nor can we read, unmoved, Paul's ſolemn account of the reſurrection; when, "In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, the dead ſhall be raiſed, and we ſhall be changed." But when we come to the viſion on the Iſle of Patmos, where the glory of heaven was unveiled to a man of God, we are loſt in the majeſty and ſublimity of the deſcription of things, which muſt be hereafter; and muſt cloſe the ſacred ſcriptures, convinced of the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible

Powers of Eloquence, when employed upon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>Among themes leſs intereſting, is there <hi>one,</hi> on which theſe powers have been unſucceſsfully employed? We read how the eloquence of one man governed all hearts in Greece, and how aſtoniſhing was its effect from the immortal Orator of Rome. All civilized na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can furniſh facts and arguments on this ſubject. Wherever arts and ſciences have found a reſidence, oratory has been a ſure attendant.</p>
                  <p>I am obliged to paſs, with regret, the characters of D'Eſpremenil, Mirabeau, Burke, Fox, Flood, and Grattan, who, within our own days, have made the Senates of three different kingdoms ring with their eloquence. With greater reluctance mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t I paſs the memorable time, when all the ſenſes, paſſions, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt breath of five thouſand people were ſuſpended at the admirable eloquence of Sheridan, while he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the cruelties of Haſtings on the banks of the Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; when with unfeeling madneſs that deſpot redden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the waters with the blood of mothers and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, and made even the river bluſh for the honor of the Britiſh name.</p>
                  <p>With pleaſure I bring my ſubject to the ſcenes of my native country; and here could, with the enthuſiaſm of Columbus in his viſion, preſent before you the lofty Andes, the majeſtic Miſſiſippi, the beautiful Ohio, the falls of Niagara, and the lakes of the north. I might take a view of this country, extending through the five zones, comprehending all the climates, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing all the varieties of the earth.</p>
                  <p>Our ears have heard what wonders have been wrought in United America. Our eyes ſee its preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent happy ſituation. After many toils and convulſions, we at length find ourſelves ſafe on the top of Nebo, and our Moſes yet alive at the head of our rulers. Hence we look forward to the flattering proſpects of futurity. Our orators and poets have announced bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed things in the latter days. Our prophets have
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:031827_0283_0FEEC67989CA7840"/>
taught us to expect the reality of golden dreams. The leaves of our future hiſtory are gilded, and the pages are left to be filled up, with the actions of a long liſt of <hi>unambitious</hi> Ceſars.</p>
                  <p>We are told, that on this our native ſpot of earth, ſlaviſh government and ſlaviſh hierarchies ſhall ceaſe; that here, the old prophecies ſhall be verified; that here ſhall be the laſt, univerſal empire on earth, the empire of reaſon and virtue; under which the goſpel of peace ſhall have free courſe and be glorified; that here the wolf ſhall dwell with the lamb, and the leop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard with the kid, and that nation ſhall no more lift up ſword againſt nation.</p>
                  <p>When the philoſopher of the eaſt foreſaw the beauty and excellence of this weſtern continent, its immenſe rivers, lakes, and mountains; cities riſing from the midſt of deſolation; "men like trees walking," where once were the haunts of ſavage beaſts; arts and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners improving; the roſe budding in the deſart, and the flowers of the garden in the ſolitary place, rich in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was the proſpect. But <hi>his</hi> viſions have become <hi>our</hi> realities. We live to enjoy bleſſings, more numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than Columbus could count.</p>
                  <p>We ſee ſchools, academies, and colleges, opening their treaſures to every family; and are taught, that religion, liberty, and ſcience, are conſtellations in the heavens, which, amidſt the revolution of empires, viſit, in ſucceſſion, all the kingdoms and people of the earth. We ſee one half of the world involved in darkneſs, and oblivious ſleep; while the other is enjoying the bleſſings of day, and of vigilant induſtry.</p>
                  <p>The day of American glory has at length dawned. No more ſhall meteors of the air, and inſects with gild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wings, lead aſtray the benighted traveller, nor the bleaking buzzards of the night tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And here, how extenſive is the theme for my feeble powers of Eloquence! yet may I employ them, in ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſting the motives which your ſons and daughters have to cultivate their minds. Gratitude to their parents; your patronage; their own ambition; their proſpects of future profit, uſefulneſs, and honeſt fame, are among the firſt.</p>
                  <p>But highly important is rendered this morning of life and privilege to us, from a conſideration, that we are born in the beſt of countries, at the beſt of times. While ſome of the human race are ſuffering the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme heats of burning zones, and others are freezing beyond the influence of benignant rays, we live in a climate, temperate, ſalubrious, and healthful. While ſome inherit from their parents poverty and ſlavery, we are the heirs of private, public, and ſocial benefits.</p>
                  <p>Our eyes have been opened in a country, where the Father of mercies has been pleaſed to condenſe his bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.

                  <p>Bleſt in the diſpenſations of nature, providence, and grace, on us depends a faithful improvement of our nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous talents. Early taught the ſhortneſs and value of life, and the importance of improving each hour of youth, while we have leiſure, and the aſſiſtance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructors, we early learn to be diligent. Obſerving, that with our parents, the ſhadows of the evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to lengthen, and that ſoon the wheel will ceaſe to turn round at the ciſtern; that ſoon they muſt leave us, and that we muſt fill their places, we learn to be am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious and emulous to excel. But beyond theſe, we have, with all other children of the univerſe, an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtill higher to improve theſe precious days.

being; yet like you, we are on a boundleſs ocean, and an eternal voyage.</p>
                  <p>As ELOQUENCE is my theme, perhaps I may be indulged in dwelling for the few remaining moments, on this laſt moſt intereſting ſubject. While enjoying the bleſſings of health, and the feſtivities of youth, we ſtand on this bridge of life, careleſs of the rapid cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of yeſterdays and to-morrows; yet reflection teaches that the hour is rapidly haſtening, when "the cloud-capt towers; the gorgeous palaces; the ſolemn temples; yea, the great globe itſelf, with all which it inherits, ſhall diſſolve, and like the baſeleſs fabric of a viſion, leave not a wreck behind." We ſhall ſurvive.</p>
                  <p>Though the loſs of parents and friends; though the frequent infirmities and viciſſitudes of life, teach us gloomily to reflect, that "An angel's arm can't ſnatch us from the grave;" yet a ſure proſpect of a reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ceaſeleſs life, bids us ſay with triumph, "Legions of angels can't confine us there." We look back on the ages which have paſſed, and ſee the millions of men, who, ſince the days of Adam, have been laid in the duſt. We ſee nine hundred and fifty millions of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional beings, now in full life, who muſt in a few years, be cold and in death; and in every day of our lives, no leſs than eighty-ſix thouſand of the human race, are laid in the grave.

                  <p>Then the trump of God ſhall ſound; then ſhall he, who once ſaid, "Lazarus, come forth," deſcend from heaven, with a mighty ſhout. Then, ſhall the

Soon ſhall we ceaſe to ſee the blue canopy of the day, and the ſtarred curtain of the night; to hear the rolling of the thunder, or ſee the lightning of the heavens; ſcenes, which now impreſs us with awe and delight. We look round creation, and ſee all living nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low our rank, diſſolving to duſt; never to revive. We ſee the flowers of ſpring die, and the leaves of autumn fade; never to reſume their beauty and verdure. But contemplating the ſoul of man, we are led to the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the poet,
