            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not barely to give you a publick Teſtimony of my Gratitude for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſonal Favours, nor yet of that Eſteem and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect which all Men bear you, for your ſingular Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Benevolence, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

            <p>Your honoured Grandfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>William Coddington,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> was choſen in <hi>England</hi> to be
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004347_0004_10044A2F8800A908"/>an <hi>Aſſiſtant</hi> of the Colony of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay, A. D.</hi> 1629, and in 1630 came o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to <hi>New-England</hi> with the Governour and the Charter, &amp;c. after which he was ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Times rechoſen to that honourable and important Office. He was for ſome Time Treaſurer of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. He was with the Chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in all publick Charges, 'and a principal Merchant in <hi>Boſton',</hi> where he built the firſt Brick Houſe.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1637, when the Contentions ran ſo high in the Country, he was grieved
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004347_0005_1004425899650D88"/>at the Proceedings of the Court, againſt Mr. <hi>Wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> and Others. And when he found that his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions to thoſe Meaſures was ineffectual, he entred his Proteſt, 'that his Diſſent might appear to ſucceeding Times'; and though he was in the faireſt Way to be Great, in the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> as to outward Things, yet he voluntarily quitted his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Situation at <hi>Boston,</hi> his large Propriety and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements at <hi>Braintree,</hi> for Peace ſake, and that he might befriend, protect, and aſſiſt the pious People, who were
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004347_0006_10044A33F2809E90"/>meditating a Removal from that Colony, on account of their religious Differences.</p>
            <p>Here when the People firſt incorporated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a Body politick on this Iſland, they choſe him to be their Judge or chief Ruler, and continued to elect him annually to be their Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for ſeven Years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 'till the Patent took Place, and the Iſland was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated with <hi>Providence-Plantations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Year 1647, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in forming the Body
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004347_0007_100449C9675B5140"/>of Laws, which has been the Baſis of our Conſtitution and Government ever ſince; and the next Year being choſen Governour of the Colony, declined the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.</p>
            <p>In 1651, he had a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from the ſupream Authority then in <hi>England,</hi> to be Governour of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, purſuant to a Power reſerved in the <hi>Patent:</hi> But the People being jealous 'the Commiſſion might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect their Lands and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as ſeemed to them by the Patent', he readily laid
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004347_0008_10044A3B12BCBCD8"/>it down on the firſt Notice from <hi>England</hi> that he might do ſo; &amp; for their further Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and Contentment, he, by a Writing under his Hand, obliged himſelf to make a formal Surrender of all Right and Title to any of the Lands, more than his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in common with the other Inhabitants, whenever it ſhould be demanded.</p>
            <p>After that he ſeems to have retired much from publick Buſineſs, till toward the latter End of his Days, when he was again divers Times prevailed with to take the Government upon him; as he did particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004347_0009_10044204C4762E70"/>1678, when he died <hi>Nov.</hi> 1. in the 78th Year of his Age, <hi>a good Man full of Days.</hi> Thus after he had the Honour to be the firſt Judge and Governour of this Iſland, 'after he had ſpent much of his Eſtate and the Prime of his Life in propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating Plantations', he died Governour of the Colony— in promoting the Welfare and the Proſperity of the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Common-Wealth, which he had in a manner founded.</p>
            <p>If there was any Oppoſition at any Time to any of his Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, or if he met with any in grateful Returns from any he had ſerved, it was no more
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004347_0010_10044A40A02E3478"/>than what ſeveral of the other firſt excellent Governours of the other <hi>New-Engliſh</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies met with, from a People made froward by the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of a Wilderneſs, and over jealous of their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. A free People will always be jealous of their Priviledges, and Hiſtory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with Examples of the Miſtakes and Ingratitude oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by that Jealouſy.</p>
            <p>If the following Diſcourſe has done any Juſtice to the Memory and Character of the pious People who firſt ſetled this Colony, or if it has any Tendency to promote
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004347_0011_100449D05265DE90"/>the true original Ends of this Plantation, I am ſure of your Patronage. And as to what relates to ſome Articles, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from your Judgment and Practice in religious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the Generoſity and Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour you inherit from your great Anceſtors, will eaſily bear with me, endeavouring to vindicate my own Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on ſuch an Occaſion.</p>
            <p>I hope there are few or no Errors in the Matters of Fact related, or the Dates that are aſſigned; to prevent any Miſtakes, I have carefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed the publick Records, and my other Materials; this
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004347_0012_1004427562CAC0E8"/>Review has bro't to my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or Remembrance many Things, that were not menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned in the Pulpit, which however it ſeemed ought not to be omitted.</p>
            <p>I deſigned to have put all the Additions and Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in the Form of Notes for my own Eaſe, but have been perſwaded to weave as many of them as were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per into the Body of the Diſcourſe, as what is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moſt pleaſing to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. I am very ſenſible, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Things will be tho't too minute or perſonal by Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, but the Deſcendents of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004347_0013_1004420F18A284C0"/>the Perſons concerned, and the Inhabitants of the Colony, will readily pardon me. And ſome other Things which are familiarly known among our ſelves, will be neceſſary to Others.</p>
            <p>It is much to be lamented that many valuable Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts of ſome of the firſt Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers here, are ſo ſoon embez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and loſt. And it is much to be wiſhed, that ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of Ingenuity and Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, would take Pains to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect as many of theſe old Papers as can be found diſperſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. I am apt to think, that theſe, with the publick
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004347_0014_10044A4511F56980"/>Records, would furniſh Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for a <hi>just Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Colony.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is here preſented to your View, will by no Means ſuperſede ſuch a Deſign; I rather hope it will ſtimulate Gentlemen in every Part of the Colony, to make a Search after ſuch Papers, and more eſpecially <hi>now,</hi> while the <hi>New-England Chronology</hi> is in Hand, compoſing by a <hi>Gentleman,</hi> above all Exceptions univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally acknowledged the beſt verſed in the Hiſtory of the Country, and the moſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to give the World a juſt and clear Idea of all our
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004347_0015_100449D8D1F0BE30"/>civil and religous Affairs, and <hi>who is</hi> already ſo well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Materials from every other Part of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>That the moſt High would be pleaſed to bleſs you with all the Bleſſings of Grace and Providence, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with your pious Lady and numerous Offspring, is the Prayer of</p>

            <p>In 1578 or 1579, there was a Patent granted by Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> for ſix Years to Sir <hi>H. Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> to plant, and inhabit ſome northern Parts of <hi>America,</hi> unpoſſeſs'd by any Prince, with whom ſhe had any Alliance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> 25. 1584, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> granted to Sir <hi>W. Raleigh</hi> a Patent for foreign Parts not poſſeſſed by any Chriſtian Prince. And the ſame Year, he took Poſſeſſion of the Country, to the weſtward of <hi>Roanoke,</hi> and called it <hi>Virginia,</hi> in Honour of his Miſtreſs. He ſent three ſeveral Colonies, to ſettle in thoſe Parts, who all failed. As did Capt. <hi>Goſnold</hi> in a like Attempt, to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, in what, is ſince called <hi>New-England,</hi> which he firſt diſcovered in 1602. And ſeveral other Attempts met with the like ill Succeſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 10 1606, King <hi>James</hi> divided <hi>Virginia</hi> into two Colonies, which were called South and North, the firſt between 34 and 41 Degrees North, and the laſt between 38 and 45, and they were
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004347_0020_10044A50CE3FCBF0"/>not to ſettle, within an hundred Miles of one another. By 1611 the <hi>ſouthern or</hi> London <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,</hi> had made an effectual Settlement; while the <hi>northern or</hi> Plymouth <hi>Company</hi> were almoſt diſcouraged at their repeated Diſappointments. However Judge <hi>Popham,</hi> Sir <hi>Ferdinando Gorges,</hi> and others, continued their Attempts, and their Deſigns, till <hi>divine Providence</hi> began a Settlement, within their Juriſdiction, without their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or Contrivance.</p>
            <p>It is acknowledged on all Hands, the <hi>firſt Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements of New-England,</hi> were a Conſequence of the Diſputes, which attended the Reformation in <hi>England;</hi> and therefore we muſt obſerve, that during this Time, <hi>viz.</hi> 1517, Learning ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving revived all over <hi>Europe,</hi> the <hi>Reformation</hi> was begun by <hi>Luther,</hi> and others in <hi>Germany,</hi> and carried on in ſeveral Parts of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> particularly in <hi>England,</hi> where, after a long Struggle, it was finally eſtabliſhed, by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> under Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who began to reign <hi>November</hi> 17. 1558.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>whole Chriſtian Religion,</hi> had been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and disfigured by the Inventions and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Popery, in a long Courſe of Time, it is ſo far from being to be wondered at, that it could not, but be expected, that many, who were juſtly and equally offended, at the horrid
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004347_0021_100449E71F954808"/>Corruptions of Popery, ſhould yet be unable, entirely to agree in their Sentiments, of what Things were to be reformed, or how far, they ſhould carry the Reformation at the firſt. And yet this, was every where, a great and unhappy <hi>Remora</hi> to that glorious Work, and gave their Enemies, a very conſiderable Advantage, which they well knew how, and failed not to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove to the utmoſt.</p>
            <p>The Effects of theſe Diviſions, and the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities with which they were maintained, were felt in <hi>England,</hi> not only, in the Beginning of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> but after it was eſtabliſhed, and even ever ſince to this Day. Among the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign (many of whom had been Exiles in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, and ſo had more Opportunity, to ſee and converſe with the foreign Proteſtants) there were many, who ſought to carry the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, farther in ſome Points, than had been done in King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Time. They ſought to take away every Thing, they imagined, had the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of Superſtition, and to make the Bible their real Rule in Worſhip, and Diſcipline, as well as in Faith. Theſe were preſently called <hi>Puritans,</hi> as pretending to ſeek a purer Church State, and a farther Reformation, than the other Party, tho't was neceſſary or expedient.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:004347_0022_10044A54F9FA73F8"/>
               <hi>Thoſe,</hi> had not the ſame Exceptions, to many Things the <hi>Puritans</hi> ſcrupled; and beſide, tho't it was but good Policy, to make as few, and as little Changes and Alterations, as poſſible, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the Ceremonies, which moſt powerfully affect the Vulgar, in order to draw in the Bulk of the Clergy, and the Nation, to favour the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Alterations, which all of them eſteemed to be, of the moſt Importance. And the <hi>Queen</hi> zealouſly eſpouſing this Party, turned the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance in their Favour, and accordingly for ſome Years, the whole Nation, in Effect, came to Church, tho' the Times were far from being ſetled.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Puritans,</hi> it ſeems, had few or no Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, to <hi>the Articles of Faith,</hi> but they chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, objected againſt the <hi>Liturgy,</hi> the <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> and the <hi>Conſtitution</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline.</hi> But however, they were not perfectly agreed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; while the much larger Part of them, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of thoſe ſince called <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> generally ſtrove to keep their Places in the Church, without <hi>conforming</hi> to ſome of the moſt offenſive Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and by voluntary Agreement among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſought to remedy, and ſupply what they tho't, was amiſs or wanting, in the <hi>parliamentary Eſtabliſhment;</hi> others of them, Fathers of thoſe ſince called <hi>Independents</hi> and <hi>Congregationaliſts,</hi> ſeparated wholly from the publick Worſhip, in
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004347_0023_100449EC6C98AFE0"/>the Pariſh Churches, and ſought a thorough Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, in the whole Form and Conſtitution of the <hi>Church,</hi> and to lay aſide the Liturgy, and all the Ceremonies together.</p>
            <p>Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> kept a watchful and jealous Eye over them all, as fearing, and being deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined againſt all farther Alterations in religious Matters. And Subſcription and Conformity, being at Times preſſed harder, as the Friends to the Puritans were out of Power, ſome of them, eſpecially of thoſe called <hi>Seperatiſts,</hi> had been driven out of <hi>England,</hi> and at Length there was a Church of the <hi>Independent Scheme,</hi> formed at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> in <hi>Holland.</hi> In the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> (whom the <hi>Puritans</hi> expected, to be a Patron to them, as he had been educated in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and had openly cenſured the <hi>Church of England</hi>) thoſe Things which offended them, were carried with an higher Hand. In the Years 1608 and 1609, ſeveral more of them in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> removed to <hi>Holland,</hi> and a Number of them ſettled at <hi>Leyden</hi> under the <hi>paſtoral Care of</hi> Mr. <hi>John Robinſon</hi> (afterwards <hi>the Father of</hi> Plymouth <hi>Colony</hi>) in hopes, to enjoy that <hi>Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Conſciences,</hi> in a ſtrange Land, they were denied at Home.</p>
            <p>Here they continued <hi>eleven or twelve Years,</hi> 'till, for many Reaſons, they began to meditate
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004347_0024_1004427F9749BB20"/>a Removal, and choſe to ſeek an <hi>Aſylum,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where in <hi>North-America</hi> near <hi>Hudſon's</hi> River. They had a long and tedious Treaty, with the Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern or <hi>Virginia Company,</hi> who might reaſonably expect, greater Sobriety, Patience, and Induſtry, from a People of ſuch a Character, and in ſuch Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and who had ſuch Views and Deſigns of their own, than they had found, in ſuch other People, as they could prevail on, to tranſport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a Wilderneſs. However the Factions and Diſturbances in the Company, and other Cauſes, delay'd the Affairs for ſome Time, 'till 1619, in the <hi>Fall,</hi> they obtain'd a Patent for the Land, but they could not obtain a legal Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Liberty of their Conſciences. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they determin'd at length to remove, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on ſome general Promiſes of Connivance, if they behaved themſelves peaceably, and hoping that the Diſtance, and remoteneſs of the Place, as well as the <hi>publick Service,</hi> they ſhould do the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> would prevent their being diſturbed.</p>
            <p>After encountring many Difficulties, and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, from the Nature and Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their Voyage, and from the Treachery of ſome of the Undertakers, they arrived at <hi>Cape Cod</hi> on the 9th of <hi>November</hi> 1620. Here they found their <hi>Patent uſeleſs,</hi> this Place being within
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004347_0025_100442215612DD18"/>the Bounds of the <hi>New-England</hi> or <hi>Plymouth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany;</hi> and yet Neceſſity obliged them to ſet down thereabout. They did therefore two Days after <hi>incorporate themſelves a Body politick,</hi> and having made ſuch a Search of the adjacent Country, as their Circumſtances would allow, at that Time of the Year, they began their Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, about Chriſtmaſs, at a Place, called by the <hi>Indians, Patuxet,</hi> by them named <hi>New-Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</hi> Infinite almoſt were the Hardſhips, and Diſtreſſes of the enſuing Winter, in which near half the Company died, for want of Neceſſaries. However through <hi>the merciful Providence of GOD</hi> they maintained their Ground, and through many Difficulties, which they overcame by Patience and the divine Bleſſing, they encreaſed to <hi>three hundred Souls</hi> in <hi>nine</hi> Years after, when they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a <hi>Patent,</hi> from the <hi>New-England Company</hi> the 13th of <hi>January,</hi> 1629, 30.</p>
            <p>In that Period, there had been many ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Attempts, to make Settlements in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> for the ſake of <hi>Trade and Husbandry only,</hi> as if divine Providence had reſerved the Place for thoſe who ſoon after took Poſſeſſion of it. The Succeſs of the <hi>Plymouth</hi> Planters began to excite the <hi>Puritans,</hi> all over <hi>England,</hi> to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate a Removal, to thoſe Parts of the World, in order to enjoy the Liberty of worſhipping GOD according to their Conſciences. There was no
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004347_0026_10044A5C58E398E8"/>Ground at all left them to hope for any Conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcention or Indulgence to their Scruples, but Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity was preſſed with harder Meaſures than e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. A great Part of the Nation was alarmed, with the Apprehenſions of <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> and that even <hi>Popery</hi> itſelf was approaching; yea, the civil Affairs, and the Peace of the Nation, began to be embroiled and interrupted by the falſe Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, and bad Councels of the unhappy Prince on the Throne; ſo that <hi>New-England</hi> began to be looked on by them, as a Place of Refuge; and it is ſaid, that ſome who proved principal Actors in the Changes and Events that followed, had even determined to tranſport themſelves here, had they not been unaccountably reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Authority. This is certain, the ſame Principles in ſome Perſons, which had rendred their Stay, uneaſy at Home, and which refuſed them a legal Toleration, in the Wilds of <hi>America,</hi> made their leaving the Kingdom, as difficult as poſſible. Whereas could good Policy have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed over Bigotry, it would have appeared a good Expedient for them, thus to clear the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Diſaffected and Nonconformiſts, and with <hi>them</hi> make ſuch an effectual <hi>Plantation,</hi> as promiſed a great <hi>Addition to the Trade and Riches, and Power of the Kingdom,</hi> and greatly enlarged its Territory.</p>

            <p>In Reality the <hi>true Grounds of Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,</hi> were not then known, or embraced by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sect or Party of Chriſtians; all Parties ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to think, that as <hi>they only</hi> were in the Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Truth, ſo <hi>they alone</hi> had a Right to reſtrain, and cruſh all other Opinions, which they reſpectively called Error, and Hereſy, where they were the moſt numerous, and powerful; and in other Places <hi>they</hi> pleaded a Title, to Liberty and Freedom of their Conſciences. And yet at the ſame Time, all would diſclaim Perſecution for Conſcience ſake, which has ſomething in it ſo unjuſt, and abſurd, ſo cruel and impious, that all Men are aſhamed of the leaſt Imputation of it. A <hi>Pretence of the publick Peace,</hi> the <hi>Preſervation of the Church of Chriſt</hi> from Infection, and the <hi>Obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of the Hereticks,</hi> are always made uſe of, to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004347_0031_100449FDD4B6C3D0"/>excuſe, and juſtify that, which ſtrip'd of all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſes, and called by it's true Name, the <hi>Light of Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Laws of Chriſt Jeſus</hi> condemn and forbid in the moſt plain and ſolemn Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Mr. <hi>R. Williams,</hi> and Mr <hi>J. Clark,</hi> two <hi>Fathers of this Colony,</hi> appear among the firſt, who publickly avowed, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is <hi>King in his own Kingdom,</hi> and that no Others, had Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over his Subjects, in the Affairs of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and eternal Salvation. So that it was not ſingular, or peculiar in thoſe People at the <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> to think themſelves bound in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to uſe the Sword of the civil Magiſtrate, to open the Underſtandings of Hereticks, or cut them off from the State, that they might not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Church, or injure the publick Peace. Theſe were not the only People, who tho't they were doing GOD good Service, when ſmiting their Brethren and Fellow-Servants; <hi>all other Chriſtian Sects</hi> acted generally, as if they tho't this was the very beſt Service they could do to GOD, and the moſt effectual Way, to promote the Goſpel of Peace, and prove themſelves the true and genuine Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> — of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who hath declared, his <hi>Kingdom was not of this World,</hi> who had commanded his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to <hi>call no Man Maſter on Earth,</hi> who had forbidden them, to <hi>exerciſe Lordſhip over each other's Conſciences,</hi> who had required them, to <hi>let the Tares grow with the Wheat till the Harveſt,</hi> and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004347_0032_10044A6C9B4A7340"/>who had in fine, <hi>given mutual Love,</hi> Peace, Long-Suffering, and Kindneſs, as the <hi>Badge and Mark of his Religion.</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Roger Williams,</hi> a Miniſter, who came o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to <hi>Salem</hi> 1630, had on a Diſguſt, removed to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> where he was <hi>an Aſſiſtant to their Miniſter Mr.</hi> Smith <hi>for two Years.</hi> And being diſguſted likewiſe at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> returned back to <hi>Salem,</hi> where he was choſen by the People, to ſucceed Mr. <hi>Skelton</hi> in 1634, the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed his Settlement there, as they had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. They made great Objections to his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and it is ſaid ſome worldly Things, helped to encreaſe the Animoſities, that ſoon prevailed againſt him; tho' Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> appears, by the whole Courſe and Tenour of his Life, and Conduct here to have been <hi>one of the moſt diſintereſted Men that ever lived, a moſt pious &amp; heavenly minded Soul.</hi> He was charged with holding it <q>unlawful for an unregenerate Man to pray, or a regenerate Man to pray with him.</q>

               </q> Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> alſo maintained a loving Correſpondence, with many of his old Friends to the Eaſt, and was eſteemed and valued by many of them; tho' he ever oppoſed, and that in Print, once and again, what he called the <hi>bloody Tenent, i. e.</hi> every Kind and Degree of Perſecution for Conſcience ſake. The Hardſhips
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004347_0035_10044A09A9798208"/>and Diſtreſſes of theſe poor Exiles, are hardly to be conceived by the preſent Generation, who thro' the divine Goodneſs, have never ſeen any Thing like what they chearfully endured.

            <p>The Baniſhment of Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Exile of many of his Adherents, did not put an End to the unhappy Diviſions, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions in the <hi>Maſſachuſetts.</hi> Mr. <hi>Hains</hi> the Governour, in 1635, did with great Difficulty, ſtill and quiet the Storm for the preſent, in the Beginning of his Adminiſtration; but Mr. after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Sir <hi>Henry Vane,</hi> jun. arriving at <hi>Boſton</hi> that Summer, and zealouſly falling in with the Opinions of one Party, he was by them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, to tarry there, (tho' deſigned for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut River</hi>) and was the next Year, 1636, <hi>choſen Governour,</hi> and then the Animoſities and Contentions, were carried to a very great Heigth. One Side reproaching the other, as <hi>Legaliſts</hi> and under a <hi>Covenant of Works,</hi> &amp;c. and the others calling them <hi>Familiſts, Antinomians,</hi> &amp;c.. The next Year, Mr. <hi>Winthrop</hi> being rechoſen Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, with a great Struggle, he ſtrenuouſly exerted
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004347_0036_10044A74DD226790"/>himſelf, to cruſh and exterminate the Opinions, he diſapproved. A <hi>Synod</hi> was called for that End at <hi>New-Town</hi> (ſince named <hi>Cambridge</hi>) on the 30th of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> where <hi>Eighty erroneous Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> were preſented, debated, and <hi>condemned;</hi> and a <hi>Court</hi> held on the 2d of <hi>October</hi> following, at the ſame Place, baniſhed a few of the chief Perſons, among thoſe who were aſperſed with thoſe Errors; and cenſured ſeveral that had been the moſt active, not, it ſeems, for their holding thoſe Opinions, but for their pretended ſeditious Carriage and Behaviour; and the <hi>Church at Boſton,</hi> likewiſe excommunicated at leaſt one of her Members, not for thoſe Opinions, but for denying they ever held them, and the Behaviour, which theſe Heats occaſioned; and ſome of <hi>theſe, with their Friends and Followers, came to this Iſland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding ſuch a formidable Number of Errors, produced at the Synod, that which theſe People differed in from the others, was <hi>chiefly this,</hi> as Mr. <hi>John Clark</hi> has briefly repreſented it, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>Dr. <hi>Mather,</hi> thus deſcribes the <hi>five Queſtions,</hi> debated between the <hi>Synod</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> (which were the ſame Points about which all the Diviſions firſt began,) they were <q>about the <hi>Order of Things in our Union to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> about the <hi>Influence of our Faith in the Application of his Righteouſneſs,</hi> about the <hi>Uſe of our Sanctification, in evidencing our Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> and about the <hi>Conſideration of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by Men, yet under a Covenant of Works,</hi> briefly they were <hi>the Points whereon depend, the Grounds of our Aſſurance for Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in another and better World.</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Neal</hi> ſays, <q>The Common-Wealth was almoſt torn in Pieces, by inteſtine Diviſions, occaſioned by the ſpreading <hi>familiſtical</hi> &amp; <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomian</hi> Errors, among the People.</q> And
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004347_0038_100442B1DA3E79B0"/>from the Writers before him, he gives the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the Controverſy, to this Purpoſe, <q>The Members of the Church at <hi>Boſton,</hi> uſed to meet once a Week, to repeat the Sermons they heard on the Lord's-Day, and to debate on the Doctrines contained in them; thoſe Meetings being peculiar to the Men, <hi>ſome of the zealous Women,</hi> tho't it might be uſeful to them. One Mrs. <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> a Gentlewoman of a bold and maſculine Spirit, and a great Admirer of Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> ſet up one at her Houſe. The Novelty of the Thing, and the Fame of the Woman, quickly gained her a numerous Audience, and from theſe Meetings aroſe all the Errors, that ſoon after overſpread the Country.</q> He ſays ſhe taught that Believers in Chriſt are perſonally united to the Spirit of GOD; that Commands to work out our Salvation with Fear and Trembling, belong to none, but ſuch as are under the Covenant of Works; that Sanctification is not a good Evidence of a good Eſtate. She likewiſe ſet up immediate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about future Events, to be believed as equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly infallible with the Scriptures; and a great many other <hi>Chimeras</hi> and <hi>Fancies,</hi> which (ſays he) under a Pretence of exalting the free Grace of GOD, deſtroy'd the practical Part of Religion, <q>and open'd a Door to all ſorts of Licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</q>

I ſhall not enter into the Merits of the Cauſe, there is neither Time, nor Occaſion for it, only, I muſt obſerve, how each Side aſcribed to the <hi>others,</hi> Conſequences, they imagined followed from their Opinions, which <hi>they</hi> did not ſee or own. And particularly the People who came here, have Things laid to their Charge, which they utterly denied, and deteſted equally with their Antagoniſts. So harſhly did their Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries judge of them, as even to involve in their Opinions, or the Conſequences of them, a Deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the Reſurection of the Dead, and the Life everlaſting; which totally ſubverts and deſtroys Chriſtianity, and all Religion at once, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily implies a future State; when yet the whole Debate ſuppoſed the Truth of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the Certainty of a future State; and the main Queſtion, was about the Method in which they might beſt obtain an Aſſurance of their Intereſt in, and their Title to, the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Saints in Light. The very firſt of the <hi>eighty</hi> Errors, to be tryed in the <hi>Synod,</hi> doth (as I remember) charge the Denial of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the Soul, as a Conſequence of the Opinion, that the Faculties of the Soul are paſſive or quieſcent in the Work of Converſion and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation; when yet the Synod themſelves, unanimouſly believed particular Election, and irreſiſtable Grace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:004347_0040_10044A7692AE68E0"/>
               <q>The Queſtion was, By what Evidence, muſt a Man proceed, in taking to himſelf the Comforts of his Juſtification? The bigger Part of the Country laid the firſt and main Streſs of our comfortable Evidence, on our Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; but the Opinioniſts (ſays Dr. <hi>Mather</hi>) were for another ſort of Evidence, as <hi>their Chief,</hi> namely the Spirit of GOD, by a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Application of a Promiſe, begetting in us, and revealing to us, a powerful Aſſurance of our being juſtified.</q> 
               <hi>Mag.</hi> B. 7. p. 14.</p>
            <p>Now, as the Doctor adds (even on this Way of ſtating the Queſtion, or expreſſing the Sentiments of thoſe called <hi>Opinioniſts,</hi> which they would be far from acquieſcing in, as expreſſing their <hi>full</hi> and true Opinion) "The Truth might eaſily have united both theſe Opinions." But as he goes on, <q>They carried the Matter on to a very perrilous Door, opened to many Errors and Evils, yea to <hi>threaten a Subverſion of the peaceable Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Government.</hi>
               </q> But they deny and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the Conſequences ſixed on them, and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their own Opinion and Conduct, and charge the other Party with as fatal and miſchievous Conſequences, and a Conduct arbitrary and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive.</p>

Beſides the Differences about thoſe Points, for which theſe People were charged with <hi>Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mianiſm,</hi> what was called <hi>Familiſm,</hi> was perhaps not a little offenſive. Nay their Differences in Opinion were worked up to almoſt a State Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel at the laſt, as <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> had been in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was in <hi>England</hi> afterwards, and as the <hi>Reformation</hi> ſtill is all over <hi>Europe.</hi> The publick Affairs of Town and Colony were affected by theſe Contentions, and the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Aſſiſtants put in and out, as the one or the other Side prevailed. The whole People un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily run into Factions and Parties, in ſuch a M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ner, as if Contention and every evil Work, had not been Evidences inconteſtable, that the Wiſdom from which they proceeded could not be from Above. But ſo it is, where Men differ about Religion, their Contentions are uſually the moſt ſharp, and carried on with the moſt irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Heat and Animoſity: Even tho' they differ about the ſmalleſt Matters, or when, as was the Caſe here, they differ from each other but in a very little.</p>
            <p>A great Part of the Body of the People, and I am apt to think, at the firſt, the Majority of the Town of <hi>Boſton,</hi> were of the ſame Side the Queſtion with thoſe People who afterwards came here. 'Tis certain the <hi>Synod</hi> and the <hi>Court</hi> were both held at <hi>New-Town,</hi> becauſe of the Diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004347_0042_10044294EE392CF8"/>of the People of <hi>Boſton.</hi> The <hi>Deputies of the Town,</hi> at leaſt ſome of them, openly eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that Party. The <hi>Town,</hi> at leaſt many of them, <hi>petitioned</hi> in their Favour. And Mr. <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> the chief Oracle then of both Town and Country, was confidently believed by them, to be of the Opinion they contended for. To which I might add the <hi>Number of the People in that Town,</hi> that were <hi>cenſured</hi> at the <hi>Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe who came away were moſt of them long eſteemed as Brethren of the <hi>Church,</hi> and never cenſured by the <hi>Church</hi> at all; nay that <hi>Church</hi> did long retain ſome Particularities, as to the Brethren's Power in Church Affairs, and their Liberty to exerciſe their Gifts in private or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Meetings, and as to the Subjects of Infant Baptiſm. It is certain Mr. <hi>Wheelwright,</hi> Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to a Branch of that Church, at a Place ſince called <hi>Braintree</hi> (where the Town had ſome Lands) was eager and zealous againſt the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works;</hi> and was baniſhed by the <hi>Court</hi> for what was then called <hi>Sedition,</hi> by the ſame Rule which will make <hi>every Diſſent</hi> from, or Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to a Majority in any <hi>religious Affairs,</hi> to be <hi>Sedition,</hi> and an Iniquity to be puniſhed by the Judge. The minor Part muſt always be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious, if it be Sedition to defend their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Opinions, and endeavour to confute the contrary. This Maxim once allowed muſt chain
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004347_0043_10044A186542A688"/>Men down under Errors and Falſhoods wherever they prevail, and even rivet their Chains. On this Foot, what will become of the <hi>glorious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> for the Goſpel in the firſt Ages of it, and the <hi>holy Apoſtles,</hi> who turned the World upſide down, who turned Men from Darkneſs to Light, from the God's of the Nations, whom they called <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities,</hi> to the living and true GOD. Nay, what ſhall we ſay of our <hi>bleſſed Saviour himſelf,</hi> who ſays he came <hi>to ſend Diviſion on Earth.</hi> How ſhall we excuſe the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> nay how ſhall we juſtify the <hi>Puritans themſelves,</hi> if it be ſeditious to oppoſe any religious Opinions we think are falſe or erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous, when the major Part of the Society hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to think otherwiſe. I muſt farther add, that however Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> at the <hi>Synod,</hi> after long Labour with him, diſowned many of the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons charged on theſe People, yet he would not condemn all the ſaid Errors in the Groſs, as the reſt did, and there is ſome Reaſon to believe that he differed from the other Miniſters to the laſt, at leaſt in the Manner of explaining theſe moſt abſtruſe and difficult Points; if he did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to hold, that <q>
                  <hi>Union to Chriſt was before Faith in him, and that the Habit of Faith pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded or followed from our Juſtification,</hi>
               </q> which 'tis ſaid, he once ſeemed to hold in the <hi>Synod; and which was in Reality the Root or Fountain of all the Opinions ſo much faulted in this People.</hi> And
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004347_0044_10044A8192D4E858"/>however Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> has in Print diſowned them, and they are by others charged with Falſhood and Calumny, in ſhrouding themſelves under the Authority of his great Name; yet <hi>they</hi> who ſhould be owned to know their own Opinions, and underſtand their own Expreſſions and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns beſt, always perſiſted in it, that <q>Mr. <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> was with them,</q> or that they meant no more than they underſtood him to mean.</p>

It is not to be wondred at, if it took them ſome Time to agree in a Method.</p>
            <p>In 1647 <hi>May</hi> 19th, a General Aſſembly of the Province (as then called) eſtabliſhed a <hi>Body of very good and wholeſome Laws,</hi> agreeable to the <hi>Engliſh Statute Book;</hi> and erected a <hi>Form of civil Government</hi> for the Adminiſtration of the Laws, and the making ſuch other, as ſhould be found neceſſary.

               <hi>A Preſident &amp; four Aſſiſtants</hi> were choſen year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to be Conſervators of the Peace, with all civil Power, and by a ſpecial Commiſſion, they were Judges of the Court of Tryals, aſſiſted by the <hi>two Wardens</hi> or Juſtices of the particular Town, in which the Court ſat from Time to Time.</p>
            <p>Every Town choſe a <hi>Council of ſix Perſons,</hi> to manage their Town Affairs, and their Town Court, had the Tryal of ſmall Caſes, but with an Appeal to the <hi>Court of the Preſident &amp; Aſſociates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Form of Government</hi> ſubſiſted till 1651, when there were ſome Obſtructions to it, by a Commiſſion granted from <hi>the Council of State,</hi> to the principal Inhabitant of the Iſland, to govern the Iſland, with a Council choſen by the People, and approved by himſelf. But the People thinking it, "a Violation or Incroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on their Liberties, and Purchaſes, as grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſecured by Charter"; immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched Mr. <hi>R.

This Order is dated 2d of <hi>October</hi> 1652, but by Reaſon of ſome Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtandings between the four Towns, it was a Year or two before they returned to their old Plan, which then laſted to the preſent Charter.</p>

In 1663 <hi>July</hi> 8. <hi>Charles 2d.</hi> granted an ample Charter, whereby the Province was made <q>a Body Corporate and Politick, in Fact &amp; Name, by the Name of the Governour and Company of <hi>the Engliſh Colony of Rhode-Iſland and Providence Plantations in New-England in America.</hi>
               </q> This CHARTER we enjoy to this Day, thro' the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Providence of GOD.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Aſſembly</hi> meets twice a Year by <hi>Charter,</hi> on Election Day, and the laſt <hi>Wedneſday of October.
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:004347_0062_10044AA2F28F5C00"/>The firſt,</hi> by Law is held at <hi>Newport,</hi> and the laſt at <hi>Providence</hi> &amp; <hi>South-Kingſton</hi> alternately. The Governour has no negative Voice, and the major Vote of the whole Aſſembly in one Houſe, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines in the Choice of civil or military Officers, but in the paſſing Laws the Aſſembly ſits in two Houſes.</p>
            <p>It would be too tedious, to give a particular Account of all the repeated Attempts, and Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems made uſe of, to wreſt the Juriſdiction and Propriety of a conſiderable Part of the Lands within our Patent from the Colony.</p>
            <p>Therefore I proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p>When Col. <hi>Dudley</hi> was appointed <hi>Preſident of the Maſſachuſetts,</hi> the <hi>Narraganſet</hi> Country, called then <hi>King's Province,</hi> was included in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. In 1685 <hi>October</hi> 6 a <hi>Writ of Quo War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto,</hi> was iſſued out againſt the <hi>Colony,</hi> which was brought here <hi>June</hi> 26. 1686, by <hi>Ed. Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph,</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> whereupon the Free Inhabitants, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially of the chief Towns, met at <hi>Newport</hi> on the 29th, and gave in their Opinion to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly, and left "the further Proceeding to the judicious Determination of the Aſſembly." The Aſſembly upon ſerious Conſideration, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and declared, that they determined, not to <q>ſtand Suit with His <hi>Majeſty, but to proceed, by
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:004347_0063_10044315D514D5D8"/>humble Addreſs to His Majeſty to continue their Priviledges &amp; Liberties according to the Charter;</hi>

            <p>The Reaſons why the Aſſembly choſe not to ſtand Suit with the King, were partly <q>
                  <hi>their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,</hi> and Inability to bear the Expence of ſuch a Law-Suit in <hi>England,</hi> and partly <hi>the Example</hi> of the many Corporations in <hi>England,</hi> which had in the like Caſe ſurrendered their Charters,</q> and perhaps the ſecret Hope they ſhould find more Favour with the King, by this way of Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was the principal Motive.</p>

            <p>After the <hi>Revolution in England,</hi> there was a General Aſſembly of the Freemen of the Colony at <hi>Newport, May</hi> 1. 1689, who agreed <q>that ſince Sir <hi>Ed. Androſs</hi> was ſeized and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined with others of his Council (at <hi>Boſton</hi>) and

               </q> and avowedly profeſſing all Allegiance to the <hi>Crown of England,</hi> they replaced all the general Officers that had been diſplaced three Years before.

And there having been no Judgment againſt the Charter, the Government allowed of the reſuming it, and thro' the divine Goodneſs, and the Clemency, Juſtice, and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of our Princes, it has been continued ever ſince.

I take it to have been no Diſhonour to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, that Chriſtians, of every Denomination, were ſuffered to lead quiet and peaceable Lives, without any Fines, or Puniſhments for their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative Opinions, or for uſing thoſe external Forms of Worſhip, they believed GOD had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and would accept. Bigots may call this Confuſion, and Diſorder, and it may be ſo, according to their poor worldly Notions of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and the Kingdom of Chriſt. But the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Order of humane Authority, aſſuming the Place and Prerogatives of Jeſus Chriſt, and tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling on the Conſciences of his Subjects, is, as Mr. <hi>R. Williams</hi> moſt juſtly calls it, <q>monſtrous Diſorder.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Tho' it be very certain, that a publick Worſhip of GOD, is very neceſſary even to civilize Mankind, who would be likely to looſe all Senſe of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on without it; yet it will not follow, that the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Magiſtrate, as ſuch, has Authority to appoint the Rites of Worſhip, and conſtrain all his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to uſe them, much leſs to puniſh them for uſing any other. What has been forever the Conſequences, of his pretending to ſuch Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and uſing his Power to ſupport it? What Glory doth it bring to GOD, and what Good can it do to Men, to force them to attend a Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip they diſapprove? It can only make them Hypocrites, and GOD abhors ſuch Worſhippers.</p>

Notwithſtanding our Conſtitution left every one to his own Liberty, and his Conſcience; and notwithſtanding the Variety of Opinions that were entertained, and notwithſtanding ſome may have contracted, too great an Indifference to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſocial Worſhip, yet I am well aſſured, there ſcarce ever was a Time, the hundred Years paſt, in which there was not a weekly publick Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of GOD, attended by Chriſtians, on this Iſland, and in the other firſt Towns of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
            <p>It is no ways unlikely, ſome odd, and whimſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Opinions may have been broached, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty enjoyed here, would tempt Perſons diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for their Opinions in the neighbouring Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, to retire to this Colony as an Aſylum. It is no ways unlikely, that ſome Perſons of a very different Genius, and Spirit from the firſt Setlers, might intrude themſelves, and uſe this Liberty as an Occaſion to the Fleſh; but the firſt Set of Men who came here, were a pious Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, Men of Vertue and Godlineſs, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their Tincture of Enthuſiaſm, which was not peculiar to them; and notwithſtanding their peculiar Opinions of Juſtification, and the Nature, and Rights, of the Chriſtian Church. They had not ſo many great and wiſe Men among them, perhaps, as were in ſome of the other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies; but their whole Number was very ſmall,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:004347_0067_1004431BF4016678"/>in Compariſon with the other Colonies: Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs they had ſome very conſiderable Men, and of ſuperiour Merit. It is true likewiſe, their Form of Government was too feeble, their <hi>firſt Patent</hi> left them without ſufficient Authority in their civil Officers, to check any popular Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; but yet, they did, and that as early as the <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> Colony, form a Body of good Laws, by which all Vice, and every Immorality, was diſcouraged or puniſhed. And throughout the whole Hiſtory of the <hi>Iſland</hi> and <hi>Colony,</hi> there is ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>I do not pretend to defend all the Opinions, that were entertained by any of them; much leſs all the extravagant Notions, that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly aſcribed to ſome of them; nor yet to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify every Word, or Action, that might be the Effect of heated Zeal, or raiſed Indignation and Reſentment. That Man, who will go about to juſtify, or condemn a Party, in the Groſs, and without Diſtinction, ſhall never be approved or imitated by me, much leſs can it be expected, I ſhould defend all the Opinions of ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent religious Parties, as were here united in civil Peace. However, I dare ſay it after Mr. <hi>J. Clark,</hi> that <q>notwithſtanding the different
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:004347_0068_10044AAE56034100"/>Conſciences and Underſtandings among them, they agreed to maintain <hi>civil Juſtice and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> neither were there ſuch Outrages com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted among them, as in other Parts of the Country were frequently ſeen.</q> (<hi>Clark</hi>'s Nar. <hi>Introd.</hi>) And I bear them Witneſs, they had a <hi>Zeal for GOD:</hi> If it were not according to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in every Article, yet they lay open to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, deſirous to find out and diſcover the whole Mind and Will of GOD; which cannot ſo truly be ſaid of all Places, where yet Men are not more infallible. If there were any of them, who made Shipwrack of Faith and a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, perhaps it would be as eaſy, as it would be invidious, to find Parallels enough in other Places, to ſhew there are other dangerous Rocks, beſides Liberty of Conſcience. It is an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Humour, that has prevailed among too many chriſtian Sects, to make Religion, and the Goſpel conſiſt, in their own peculiar and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing Tenets, which would almoſt tempt an impartial Man, to think it ought rather to conſiſt, in thoſe Things, wherein they are moſt generally agreed, and conclude in the Words of the excellent Dr. <hi>Cotton Mather,</hi> 
               <q>The Period haſtens for <hi>a new Reformation,</hi> wherein 'tis likely none of <hi>our very beſt Parties,</hi> will be in all Things, the Standard of what ſhall prevail in the World, but our holy Lord will form a new People, of thoſe good Men that ſhall u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite

            <p>It muſt be a mean contracted Way of thinking, to confine the Favour of GOD, and the Power of Godlineſs, to one Set of ſpeculative Opinions, or any particular external Forms of Worſhip. How hard muſt it be, to imagine, all other Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, but our ſelves, muſt be formal, and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical, and deſtitute of the Grace of GOD, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Education or Capacity differs from ours, or that GOD has given them more or leſs Light than to us, tho' we can't deny, they give the proper Evidence, of their fearing GOD, by their working Righteouſneſs; and ſhew their Love to him, by keeping what they underſtand, he has commanded; and tho' their Faith <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> purifies their Hearts, and works by Love, and overcomes the World. It would be hard to ſhew, why Liberty of Conſcience, mutual For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, and Good Will, why brotherly Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Charity, is not as good a Center of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as a conſtrain'd Uniformity in external Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, or a forced Subſcription to ambiguous Articles. Experience has dearly convinced the World, that Unanimity in Judgment and Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, can't be ſecured by penal Laws. Who can tell, why the Unity of the Spirit in the Bonds of Peace, is not enough for Chriſtians to aim at?
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:004347_0070_10044AB161882AE0"/>And who can aſſign a Reaſon, why they may not love one another, tho' abounding in their own ſeveral Senſes? And why, if they live in Peace, the GOD of Love and Peace, may not be with them?</p>
            <p>Indulgence to tender Conſciences, might be a Reproach to the Colony, an hundred Years agon, but a better Way of thinking prevails in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Part of the chriſtian Church at preſent. It is now a Glory to the Colony, to have avowed ſuch Sentiments ſo long ago, while Blindneſs in this Article, happened in other Places, and to have led the Way as an Example to others, and to have firſt put the Theory into Practice.</p>
            <p>Liberty of Conſcience, is more fully eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and enjoyed now, in the other <hi>New-Engliſh Colonies;</hi> and <hi>our Mother-Kingdom,</hi> grants a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Toleration, to all peaceable and conſcientious Diſſenters from the parliamentary Eſtabliſhment. Greater Light breaking into the World, and the Church, and eſpecially, all Parties by Turns, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periencing, and complaining aloud of the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of Conſtraint, they are come to allow as reaſonable to all others, what they want and challenge for themſelves. And there is no other Bottom but this to reſt upon, to leave others the Liberty we ſhould deſire ourſelves, the Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made them free. This is
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:004347_0071_10044B51A06EFE68"/>doing as we would be done by, the grand Rule of Juſtice and Equity; this is leaving the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church to Jeſus Chriſt, the King and Head over all Things, and ſuffering his Subjects to obey and ſerve him.</p>
            <p>But to take Things in their Order, Mr. <hi>R.

It don't appear to me, that he had any Doubt of the true Mode, and proper Subjects of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, but, that no Man had any Authority, to revive the Practice, of the ſacred Ordinances, without a new and immediate Commiſſion. It is alſo ſaid (<hi>Neale.</hi>) <q>That his Church hereupon crumbled to Peices, every one following his own Fancy, and the Worſhip of GOD came to be generally neglected.</q> But I believe this to be a Miſtake in Fact, for it certainly appears, there was a flouriſhing Church of the Baptiſts there, a few Years after the Time of the ſuppoſed breaking to Pieces; and 'tis known by the Names of the Members, as well as by Tradition, they were ſome of the firſt Setlers at <hi>Providence;</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, 'tis poſſible ſome of his Followers, might embrace his <hi>new Opinions.</hi> Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> uſed to uphold a publick Worſhip, ſometimes, tho' not weekly, as many now alive remember, and he uſed to go once a Month, for many Years, to Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s in the <hi>Narraganſet,</hi> for the ſame End.</p>
            <p>There was no Reaſon, to lay aſide the Uſe of the ſacred Inſtitutions of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> becauſe they had been perverted, for ſurely the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> muſt of Neceſſity have an inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Right, to revive, or rectify, any of his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:004347_0073_10044B5711394D40"/>that have been miſuſed. The <hi>Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants</hi> in general have done ſo, by both <hi>Sacraments,</hi> which they have all of them reſcued from ſome or other of the <hi>Corruptions of Popery.</hi> And why they may not be as well reſcued from every <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,</hi> as from ſome, and why Chriſtians may not revive the true Form of adminiſtring Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, as well as the Supper, is hard to tell, unleſs we make a Charm of the Inſtitution. So long as we have the New-Teſtament, wherein the <hi>origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Commiſſion and Inſtructions are contained,</hi> we can want no immediate Warrant, to obey the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Laws of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> any more than a new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and new Miracles, to juſtify our belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the old Facts and Doctrines of the Goſpel. The Bible contains the Religion of Chriſtians, and the Word of GOD is a ſufficient Rule of Faith and Worſhip. Had Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> adhered to this Maxim, the Maxim of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and more eſpecially of the <hi>Puritans,</hi> he might have continued an <hi>Anabaptiſt</hi> all his Days, as 'tis ſaid he was more inclinable to them, in his latter Time.</p>

<pb n="59" facs="unknown:004347_0074_10044AB7292D84E8"/>would ſoon draw in <hi>Anabaptiſm</hi> after it,— This <hi>Cartwright</hi> and the <hi>Diſciplinarians</hi> denied, and were offended at.— But theſe good Men judged right, they conſidered only as prudent Men, that <hi>Anabaptiſm</hi> had it's Riſe, from the ſame Principles the <hi>Puritans</hi> held, and it's Growth from the ſame Courſe, they took; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the natural Tendency, of their Principles and Practices toward it; eſpecially that ONE PRINCIPLE, as it was then by them miſunderſtood, that the <hi>Scripture was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequata agendorum regula,</hi> ſo as nothing might be lawfully done, without expreſs Warrant, either from ſome <hi>Command or Example</hi> therein contained; which Clue, if followed as far as it would go, would certainly in Time carry them as far as the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> had then gone.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This I beg Leave to look on as a moſt glorious Conceſſion, of the moſt able Adverſaries. One Party contend, that the Scripture is the adequate Rule of Worſhip, and for the neceſſity of ſome Command or Example there; the other Party, ſay this leads to <hi>Anabaptiſm.</hi> It ſeems very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, that the <hi>Puritans,</hi> at leaſt ſome of the Puritans, put the <hi>Baptiſm of Infants,</hi> and the <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring Baptiſm by Sprinkling,</hi> on a different Foot from many of the other Party. It was one grand Reaſon of the <hi>Plymouth</hi> People's Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in <hi>Holland</hi> that the <hi>Dutch</hi> would not reform
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:004347_0075_1004431F5511E7D8"/>the Cuſtom of baptiſing indifferently, the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of all Perſons that had been themſelves bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in Infancy. And it was once a great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, againſt <hi>New England,</hi> that the Children only of viſible Church Members, were admitted to <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> Nor did the general Way of bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Grand-Children of the Covenant, or the Infants of ſuch as do, what is called <hi>(owning the Covenant) (a Phraſe and Way peculiar perhaps to New England;)</hi> take Place, without a very great and long Struggle: perhaps it don't yet univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally prevail. When the firſt Principles, &amp; Practice of <hi>New England</hi> are inquired into, and compared together, and with thoſe that prevailed forty Years after; it will be found no great wonder, if a Perſon (and there have been ſuch Perſons) who heard the unanſwerable Argument, with which ſome <hi>Paedo-baptiſts</hi> prove the Infants of thoſe who are not Members of ſome viſible Church, are not to be baptiſed; and the like powerful Arguments, with which others, prove that other Infants have an equal Right and Claim with the Infants of Church Members; I ſay, it would be no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if ſuch a Perſon ſhould believe them both, and conclude in the Words of the late excellent Dr. <hi>C. Mather</hi> on a like Occaſion, "that REGE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NERATION <hi>is the Thing, without which, a Title unto Sacraments, is not to be pretended.</hi> That real Regeneration, is that which before GOD, renders Men capable of claiming Sacraments; and viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

            <p>But to return, about the Year 1653 or 54, there was a Diviſion in the <hi>Baptiſt Church,</hi> at <hi>Providence, about the Rite of laying on of Hands,</hi> which ſome pleaded for as eſſentially neceſſary to Church-Communion, and the others would leave indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. Hereupon they walked in two Churches, one under Mr. <hi>C. Browne,</hi> Mr. <hi>Wickenden,</hi> &amp;c. the other under Mr. <hi>Thomas Olney;</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">This laſt continued 'till about 20 Years ſince, when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming deſtitute of an Elder, the Members were united with other Churches.

            <p>It is remarkable, that the Principles <hi>of a too rigid Separation,</hi> planted by Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> have taken a deep Root, while ſome other of his dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Opinions are almoſt withered away.

            </p>
            <p>This Church ſhot out into divers Branches, as the Members increaſed, and the Diſtance of their Habitations made it inconvenient to attend the publick Worſhip in the Town; ſeveral Meetings
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:004347_0077_10044B5895E88D10"/>were thereupon fixed at different Places, for their Eaſe and Accommodation; and about this Time the large Townſhip of <hi>Providence</hi> became divided into <hi>four Towns:</hi> their <hi>Chapels of Eaſe,</hi> began to be conſidered as diſtinct Churches, tho' all are yet in a Union of Councils and Intereſts: And there is a ſtrict Aſſociation, of all the Baptiſt Churches in <hi>New England,</hi> that hold the Doctrine of <hi>laying on of Hands, in that Senſe,</hi> maintained, by yearly Meetings of the Elders and Brethren, at ſeveral Places, from time to time, where the Affairs of all the Churches are conſidered.</p>
            <p>The People who came to <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> who were Puritans of the higheſt Form, had deſired and depended on the Aſſiſtance of Mr. <hi>Wheelwright,</hi> a famous Congregational Miniſter aforementioned.

            <p>It remains now that I ſay a few Words rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the State of the INDIANS, within the Bounds of this Colony, and the Circumſtances of the Engliſh in Regard to them.</p>

            <p>A few Years, three or four, before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> came to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> the <hi>Indians</hi> had been dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully waſted away by devouring Sickneſs, from <hi>Narraganſet</hi> to <hi>Pen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>bſcut.</hi> So that the Living ſufficed not to bury the Dead, and the Ground was covered with their Bones in many Places. This wonderfully made Room for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at <hi>Plymouth</hi> and <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> and thoſe Colonies protected the reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="unknown:004347_0085_10044B62C58A3A68"/>
In the Year 1637, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> with united Forces ſubdued the <hi>Pequots,</hi> who had attacked their Brethren in <hi>Connecticut;</hi> the <hi>Narraganſetts,</hi> who bordered on the <hi>Pequot</hi>'s Land, conſented and aſſiſted in their Deſtruction, thro' a Deſire of Revenge, which is remarkable in all the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages, tho' their <hi>old Sachems</hi> deſired to have preſerved Peace.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Nantygganſiks,</hi> or <hi>Narraganſets,</hi> inhabited the Lands, or governed over all the <hi>Indians</hi> within the Bounds of this Colony. They were a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, a rich, and powerful People: and though they are by ſome ſaid, to have been leſs fierce, and warlike than the <hi>Pequots,</hi> yet it appears they had lately before the <hi>Engliſh</hi> came, not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed their Numbers, by receiving many who had fled to them, from the devouring Sickneſs, or Plague in the other Parts of the Land; but they had enlarged their Territories, and that both on the Eaſtern &amp; Weſtern Boundaries. They were reckoned <hi>five Thouſand</hi> fighting Men. <hi>(Mſs. of Mr. R. W. in Evidence.)</hi> And Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſays, they were ſo populous, that a Traveller would meet with a <hi>dozen Indian Towns</hi> in <hi>twenty Miles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the midſt of this mighty, and haughty Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the little handful of helpleſs <hi>Engliſh,</hi> ventur'd to ſit down; tho' not without taking all poſſible Precautions; on the one Hand, to give them no
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:004347_0086_10044ABBDBCA6CF8"/>juſt Offence, and on the other Hand, to keep themſelves in the beſt Poſture of Defence their Circumſtances would admit of. But the Conqueſt and utter Deſtruction of the <hi>Pequots,</hi> had for the preſent endeared Engliſh-Men to the <hi>Narragan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſets.</hi> And the Conduct and Valour they had ſhewn, and the wonderful Succeſs of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, had made them a Terror to all the Indian Nations round about.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> at firſt "made a League of pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceable Neighbourhood, with all the Sachems and Natives round about"; in this <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> was included. And on the 7th of <hi>July</hi> 1640, Mr. <hi>Coddington,</hi> with <hi>the reſt of his Aſſiſtants,</hi> had a particular Treaty of Peace and Amity with <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antonomy</hi> and the <hi>reſt of the Sachems.</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the next Year, there was a Miſunderſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſome Hoſtilities, occaſioned, I think, by ſome of the <hi>Indians,</hi> (if not <hi>Myantonomy</hi> himſelf) kindling Fire in Mr. <hi>Eaſton's</hi> Land, <hi>Lord's Day April</hi> 4. 1641. <hi>whereby an Houſe of his was burnt.</hi> But whether it was deſignedly, or only through careleſsneſs, don't plainly appear in <hi>the Records.</hi> However it alarmed the People, and among other Meaſures, they fitted out an armed Boat, to ply round the <hi>Iſland,</hi> to keep off the <hi>Indians</hi> from Landing; and it ſeems in ſome Scuffle on that Account, <hi>two Engliſh Men were wounded,</hi> and <hi>one Indian ſlain;</hi> tho' the Orders to the Soldiers were
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:004347_0087_10044328AD5A32F0"/>as mild and prudent as could be given. They likewiſe appointed <hi>Garriſon Houſes,</hi> to which the People were to repair on an Alarm. Among which I find one was Mr. <hi>Lenthal</hi>'s the Miniſter. But the Rupture laſted not long, before Peace was reſtored.</p>
            <p>In 1643 <hi>Myantonomy</hi> the great Sachem of the <hi>Narraganſets,</hi> was taken Priſoner by <hi>Uncas</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chem of the <hi>Moheags,</hi> and ſome time after Slain, and as ſome of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſay, after Quarter and Promiſe of Life given. This excited his Subjects to revenge his Death, but the Terror of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> at the <hi>Meſſachuſetts</hi> kept them quiet. And ſo 'tis ſaid, that ſeven Years after, there were ſome Commotions ſtilled, by the ſame Terror likewiſe in 1653, &amp;c. &amp;c</p>
            <p>In 1652 when the <hi>Council of State</hi> confirmed their Patent, the People were put on ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes againſt the <hi>Dutch</hi> at <hi>New-York,</hi> or <hi>New-Netherlands,</hi> and the next Year the <hi>Iſland</hi> ſent ſome Men to the Aſſiſtance of their Country-Men, ſettled at <hi>Long-Iſland,</hi> which gave great Offence to the <hi>Towns on the Main,</hi> and in the <hi>two Dutch Wars,</hi> in King <hi>Charles 2d's</hi> Time, the <hi>Colony &amp; Iſland</hi> were put to conſiderable Expence and Trouble, to put and keep themſelves in a Poſture of Defence.</p>

The Vices of Chriſtians have been an inſurmountable Obſtacle to the progreſs of Chriſtianity, in all the other Parts of the World, as there are too many Evidences. May theſe Reflections, however, ſtir us up to adorn our holy Religion, and to be careful that we give none Offence to any, that are without: And may it diſpoſe all Perſons to contribute all in their Power, to farther the Converſion of theſe People to the Chriſtian Religion. They demand our Compaſſion, and our Prayers to the Throne of Grace, that God would remove the Vail from their Eyes, and all Prejudices from their Hearts; that he would convert and ſave them.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>R. Williams</hi> at firſt, gave a promiſing Character, of the Morals of theſe People; but on longer Acquaintance, and more Experience, he ſeems to have altered his Opinion of them;
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:004347_0101_10044B6D53EE5B20"/>as appears by ſome Expreſſions in a <hi>Manuſcript</hi> of his yet remaining. <q>The Diſtinction of drunken, and ſober honeſt SACHEMS, is (ſays he) both lamentable, and ridiculous; lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, that <hi>all Pagans</hi> are given to Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and ridiculous, that thoſe (of whom he was ſpeaking) are excepted. It is (ſays he) notoriouſly known, what Conſciences <hi>all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> make of <hi>Lying, Stealing, Whoring, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering.</hi>
               </q> &amp;c. 25th 6th m. 1658.</p>
            <p>After this Account <hi>of their Morals,</hi> I ſhould think it hardly worth while to inquire, what was their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Worſhip</hi> that had ſo little Effect on their Converſation; if we had not juſt heard what a ſcandal to Chriſtianity, the Lives of too many Chriſtian are. However <hi>the Faith of this People and their idolatrous Worſhip,</hi> was much like the other <hi>Indian</hi> Nations. They believed in one Great and Good God, who lived ſomewhere at a great Diſtance in the South Weſt, and that the Spirits of Good Men do after Death reſide with him. But, the Government of the World, they ſeem'd to think, left in the Hands of an Evil God, the Devil, to whom, with many inferior &amp; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Deities, they paid their chief Worſhip, at their <hi>Nicemmors,</hi> or deviliſh Feaſts, as Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> calls them.</p>

The Indians in this Part of <hi>America,</hi> appear to have been ſome of the leaſt improved, of the <hi>humane Species,</hi> without any Learning, or Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in any of the politer Arts of Life, even without <hi>Iron</hi> and the Improvements which depend on that. The ſtrange Deſtruction of this People, now ſince the Wars ceaſed, and within Memory, is very remarkable. Their inſuperable Averſion to the Engliſh induſtry, and Way of Life, the Alteration from the <hi>Indian</hi> Method of living, their <hi>Lazineſs,</hi> and their <hi>univerſal Love of Strong Drink,</hi> have ſwept them away, in a wonderful Manner. So that there are now above <hi>twenty Engliſh</hi> to <hi>one Indian</hi> in the Colony. Their few miſerable Remainders are left, as Monuments of the Anger of a righteous God, and for our Warning &amp; Inſtruction. While the Cont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ntions, and mutual Animoſities of the <hi>Indians</hi> in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and their curſed Thirſt of Revenge, made them a Prey to the Weak, and ſmall Number of Engliſh, we ſhould learn not to bite &amp; devour one another, leſt we be devoured one of another, or of the Judgments of God. While we have ſeen their Iniquities prove their Ruin, we ſhould learn to break off from our Sins by Righteouſneſs, and eſpecially abſtain from, and watch againſt <hi>the Sins,</hi> which have been ſo evidently both, the procuring Cauſes, and the Means, of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. When God was conducting the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> to the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and driving out the
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:004347_0103_10044B71CE96F858"/>Inhabitants, to make room for them, he was pleaſed to warn and require them, not to defile themſelves with the Abominations of thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, leſt as the Land then ſpued out its Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, ſo it ſhould ſpue out them likewiſe, when they in like manner defiled it. Tho' it wou'd be ridiculous to compare our ſelves, to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and the <hi>Indians</hi> to the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> in many Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, yet in this Reſpect, it may be proper to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue, that if we <hi>Indianize</hi> in our Manners and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, they will in Time draw down the like, or as heavy Judgments of God, upon us, as thoſe with which he hath deſtroyed our Predeceſſors. God grant that <hi>the People,</hi> who have been <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown in the Wilderneſs</hi> may be <hi>Enſamples</hi> to us, to prevent our luſting after any Evils, leſt we be deſtroyed likewiſe of the Deſtroyer!—</p>
            <p>And this brings me now at laſt, to the RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MARKS I promiſed at the Beginning. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt is, <hi>The wonderful and unſearchable Providence of GOD, in the whole Affair,</hi> of <hi>driving out the Natives, and planting Colonies of Europeans, and Churches of Chriſtians, in the Place of Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm and Barbarity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I pretend not to have known the Mind of the LORD, or to have been his Counſeller, or to be able to comprehend, the Ways of divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. GOD's Judgments are a great Deep;
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:004347_0104_1004435B8C5691C0"/>but we muſt be wilfully blind, if we cannot ſee, <hi>that the Hand of the Lord hath wrought this.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Diſcovery, and the Conqueſt of AMERICA, with the amazing Deſolations wrought therein, appear a more remarkable Event, than a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> other in all prophane Hiſtory, ſince the univerſal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge.

               </gap>ful Deſolation, ſuch an utter Deſtruction! If we believe a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence (and 'tis impoſſible we can believe none) we muſt needs think it concerned, in the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and the Puniſhment of Kingdoms, and Nations; and that theſe Parts of the World, tho' ſeperated, hid, and unknown to the reſt, are yet as near the Omnipreſence of GOD, and as much under his Government, as any other. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhould take Notice of the wonderful Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of GOD, in this great Affair. How ſhould we learn to ſubmit our little perſonal Affairs, to the divine Providence, when we ſee that Nations, before Him, are but as the ſmall Duſt of the Ballance? And how juſtly may we ſay, <hi>Great and marvellous
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:004347_0105_1004433DCAE181D8"/>are thy Works, O Lord GOD Almighty; true &amp; faithful are thy Ways, and righteous are thy Judgments, thou King of Saints; who ſhall not fear thee, and glorify thy Name, for thou only art holy: Let all Nations come and worſhip before thee, for thy Judgments are made manifeſt. The moſt High ruleth in the Kingdoms of Men, and giveth them to whomſoever he pleaſeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, <hi>the Settlement of New England in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular,</hi> was evidently providential, in <hi>many Reſpects.</hi> I have mentioned often the prevailing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive with the People, who came firſt to plant and inhabit in this Wilderneſs; but the Difficulties and Diſcouragements in their Way, were really many and very great; ſo that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reflects the leaſt upon them, <q>muſt wonder ſo many were carried out from a flouriſhing State, to a Wilderneſs ſo far diſtant; for (as One of them, Mr. <hi>Shepherd</hi> of <hi>Cambridge;</hi> his Life in the <hi>Magnalia;</hi> ſays) "they were not all of them raſh and weak ſpirited Perſons, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate of what they left behind, and were going to. It was not Gain, or Riches they aimed at. When we look back (ſays he) and conſider, what a ſtrange Poiſe of Spirit, God had laid on many of our Hearts, we cannot but wonder at our ſelves, that ſo many, and ſome ſo weak and tender, with ſuch Chearfulneſs, and conſtant Reſolution, againſt ſo many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of Friends, &amp; Diſcouragements from
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:004347_0106_10044B9DD299F680"/>the ill Reports of the Country, and the Straits and Wants, and Trials of God's People in it, yet ſhould leave our Accommodations &amp; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, forſake our deareſt Relations, overlook all the Dangers and Difficulties of the vaſt Sea, and all this to go into a Wilderneſs, where we could forecaſt nothing but Care and Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, only in hopes to enjoy CHRIST in his Ordinances, and the Fellowſhip of his People.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, as theſe People came not here, for Plunder, which drew over the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to the Southward, neither did they ſettle themſelves <hi>by Force or by their own Might;</hi> but GOD was pleaſed to make ready a Place prepared as an Aſylum for them: And ſince he has wonderfully driven out and conſumed <hi>the Natives</hi> by his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Judgments, their Sins have proved their Puniſhment; and their deteſtable Vices, have drawn on thoſe mortal Sickneſſes, which have waſted away all within the Engliſh Pale, but a few embraced <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> or who by ſubmitting to the <hi>Engliſh Power,</hi> remains the Memorials of theſe wonderful Events. It is true, the <hi>Indian</hi> Jealouſy and Revenge prevented a Union among their ſeveral <hi>Clans</hi> at firſt, and made them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental in the Deſtruction of one another, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had great Advantages in their Arms; but ſtill the <hi>Indians</hi> vaſtly out-numbred them; were more able to endure Fatigue, &amp; Hardſhips, Hunger, &amp; Travel; and were perfectly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:004347_0107_10044B73A8406D98"/>with their own Country. However a <hi>remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Interpoſition of Providence,</hi> was viſible in ſome of the earlieſt, and other the moſt important En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes againſt them; and it would be unjuſt not to give to GOD the Glory due to his Name: The LORD is King for ever, and the Heathen are periſhed out of the Land! As therefore GOD hath planted this People, and not their own Skill, or Power, ſo neither let them imagine it was for their Merits and Deſerts: We know not the ſecret and future Deſigns of Providence. Only let us remember, that He who chaſtiſeth the <hi>Heathen,</hi> will alſo correct thoſe, <hi>who are called by his Name,</hi> if they turn to Folly.</p>
            <p>Again, 'tis remarkable how divine Providence was pleaſed to ſupply their Wants in a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, among a People that never took care for the Morrow; and to ſupport them under the Diſtreſſes they were tried with. At <hi>Plymouth</hi> and <hi>Boſton,</hi> many died at firſt, for want of Neceſſaries and Conveniencies, but afterwards, it was many Years, before any Sickneſs prevailed amongſt the <hi>Planters.</hi> And tho' they have often ſince been viſited with ſore Calamities, and waſting Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, yet their Numbers have continually increaſed to a very great Degree; while the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> have been waſted away, by the ſame Diſeaſes, and ſome other infectious Diſtempers, from which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have been providentially

It was long before the Church at <hi>Boſton</hi> could have any Evidence of their holding thoſe Opinions, which that Church condemned, the Witneſſes at the laſt were Parties and tranſported with Zeal. 'Tis not doubted there was ſome Difference in their Opinions, at leaſt in their Expreſſions; but there is much Ground to doubt, whether any of them held all the Opinions condemned in the <hi>Synod,</hi> and that few of them held many of thoſe harſh Conſequences, which their Adverſaries, drew from their Tenets.

            <p>We cannot reaſonably ſuppoſe that they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly forgot or neglected <hi>the ſole End</hi> of their Removal, but as they followed that <hi>Church Order,</hi>

            <p>However, while we are contemplating the Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of our Settlement, and the Ends &amp; Views of our pious Anceſtors, when we find <hi>that Religion and Conſcience began the Colony,</hi> 'tis natural, 'tis neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to reflect &amp; conſider how theſe Ends are anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered by their Poſterity at preſent.

Their Poſterity poſſeſs the Fruit of their Labour, and ſhould think themſelves obliged to fulfil the pious Ends of our Plantation. GOD juſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects that we fear the Lord our God, and Love Him, and walk in his Ways, and ſerve him with all our Heart. It ſeems, that pure Religion, and true Godlineſs, is what we <hi>in a moſt peculiar

            <p>The Poſterity of a People, who were guided by the Providence of GOD, to this <hi>happy Iſland,</hi> as a ſafe Retreat from the ſtormy Winds; as a Place of freedom to practice every Branch of Religion in, muſt be inexcuſable, if they degenerate and forget the God of their Fathers. The <hi>very Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our original Incorporation,</hi> obliges us to "ſerve GOD &amp; JESUS CHRIST, &amp; obey all his holy Laws." Irreligion then, and Prophanneſs, and Immorality muſt be a peculiar Reproach to ſuch a People. Our Fathers will riſe up in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt, and condemn their degenerate Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, and the GOD of our Fathers will caſt us off for ever, if we do not practice that Sobriety, Righteouſneſs, and Godlineſs, which his Goſpel requires, and we are under ſo many peculiar Obligations to obſerve. Nay, it will be more tolerable for the <hi>Pequots,</hi> the <hi>Wampaneags,</hi> the <hi>Narraganſets</hi> in the Day of Judgment, than for ſuch of us as obey not the Goſpel of our LORD JESUS CHRIST. It is true, the <hi>Indian Nations</hi> did obſtinately refuſe the Goſpel, but they knew not what they did; they did it ignorantly, and in Unbelief; while we have known our Maſter's Will; and to whom much is given, of them much
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:004347_0116_10044BA72E4E04E8"/>will be required. As we have been as it were lifted up to Heaven with Privileges, our Fall will be ſo much the greater, in the bottomleſs Pit, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we lay hold on eternal Life.</p>
            <p>If our Neighbours obſerve the Manners of the Inhabitants are reformed in any Inſtances, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly grievous to them; let us endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form whatever is ſtill really amiſs among us, and put away the Evil of our Doings, that the Lord GOD may dwell among us. May we be noted only, and ever, for the general Diſcharge of all publick and private Vertues; for the impartial Adminiſtration of Juſtice; and the ſteddy Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of good and wholeſome Laws; and for leading quiet and peaceable Lives, in all Godlineſs and Honeſty.</p>
            <p>It is an old and common Obſervation, that the Stature, and Complection<note n="*" place="bottom">In like manner ſome Diſeaſes are peculiar to every Country, perhaps we may <hi>this Way</hi> account for what has been, in vain, attempted to be accounted for ſo many other Ways; viz. the <hi>defective Teeth</hi> ſo common in <hi>New England.</hi> Mr. <hi>R.

               </note> of humane Creatures, as well as of Plants and Animals; yea, and the Genius and Diſpoſitions of a People, are very much influenced by the Soil, and Climate; by the
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:004347_0117_10044B8018595A48"/>Situation, the Nature, and Circumſtances of the Place they inhabit. Thus, the Inhabitants of the ſeveral Parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> of <hi>Germany</hi> &amp;c. are cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterized from their reſpective Countrys; and thus it was obſerved of the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi> The peculiar Genius, and Diſpoſitions of a People, muſt ariſe from hence; or the Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Laws they live under; or the Genius of the preſent chief Commanders.

               </note> only that in proportion to their greater populouſneſs, they exceeded in the Vices, common to all the <hi>Indian</hi> Nations. <hi>Idleneſs</hi> and <hi>Intemperance</hi> are every where branded, as <hi>Indian Vices;</hi> and they were complained of, as ſhamefully <hi>negligent</hi> in the <hi>Education</hi> of their Children, and that they had in a Manner, no <hi>Family Government</hi> at all. Tho' the Face of the Country is greatly changed by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Induſtry, and an almoſt Immenſe Labour and Expence, yet a plentiful Country will always afford its Inhabitants Inducements and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to abuſe the divine Goodneſs, and to turn the Grace of GOD into Wantonneſs. If inſtead of having been able, to teach the <hi>Indians, Chriſtian
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:004347_0118_10044369A0637548"/>Vertues,</hi> we ſhould learn, and imitate the <hi>Indian Vices,</hi> how unhappy, how reproachful, how la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable would it be? Surely, we muſt think GOD expects more from us, with all our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Knowlege, with the Goſpel, the Word of GOD; which is able to make us wiſe to Salvation, thro' Faith that is in Chriſt Jeſus. We have not only the Light of Reaſon, brightned and improved, but Revelation, to be as a Guide to us: Let us make the Scriptures then as a Light to our Feet, and a Lamp to our Path.</p>
            <p>And in fine, let every Sect, and Party of Chriſtians among us, be followers of GOD as dear Children: Let us be careful to build only Gold, Silver, precious Stones, on the Rock of Ages, the true Foundation of our Faith, and Hope: Let us walk worthy of GOD to all well pleaſing, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn the Chriſtian Religion in general, in the Sight of the Heathen; and recommend our diſtinguiſhing Opinions to one another, by a more exemplary Behaviour; and ſo induce others to glorify GOD our Heavenly Father.</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>Liberty of Conſcience was the Baſis of this Colony.</hi> Our Fathers tho't it juſt and neceſſary to allow each other mutually to worſhip GOD, as their Conſciences were reſpectively perſwaded: They tho't no Man had Power over the Spirit of GOD; and that the Duty of the Magiſtrate was
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:004347_0119_1004434BB58781A8"/>to leave every one to follow the Light of his Conſcience. They were willing to exhibit to the World, an Inſtance that Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was conſiſtent with the publick Peace, and the flouriſhing of a civil Common Wealth, as well as that Chriſtianity could ſubſiſt without Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, and that bearing each others Burdens, was the way to fulfil the Law of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I do not know there was ever before, ſince the World came into the Church, ſuch an Inſtance, as the Settlement of this <hi>Colony and Iſland.</hi> In other States the civil Magiſtrate had for ever, a <hi>publick Driving</hi> in the particular Schemes of Faith, and Modes of Worſhip; at leaſt, by nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Diſcouragements, by annexing the Rewards of Honour and Profit to his own Opinions; and generally, the Subject was bound by penal Laws, to believe that Set of Doctrines, and to worſhip GOD in that Manner, the Magiſtrate pleaſed to preſcribe. <hi>Chriſtian Magiſtrates</hi> would unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably aſſume to themſelves, the ſame Authority in religious Affairs, which any of the <hi>Kings of Judah, or Iſrael,</hi> exerciſed, either by Uſurpation, or by the immediate Will, and Inſpiration of GOD; and a great deal more too. As if the becoming <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> gave the Magiſtrate any new Right, or Authority over his Subjects, or over the Church of Chriſt; and as if that becauſe they ſubmitted perſonally to the Authority, and
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:004347_0120_10044BA8D97C0088"/>Government of Chriſt in his Word, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they might cloath themſelves with his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; or rather, take his Scepter out of his Hand, and lord it over GOD's Heritage. It is lamentable that <hi>Pagans and Infidels</hi> allow more Liberty to <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> than they were won't to allow to one another. 'Tis evident, the civil Magiſtrate as ſuch, can have no Authority to decree Articles of Faith, and to determine Modes of Worſhip, and to interpret the Laws of <hi>Chriſt</hi> for his Subjects, but what muſt belong to all Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates; but no Magiſtrates can have more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over Conſcience, than what is neceſſary to preſerve the publick Peace; and that can be only to prevent one Sect, from oppreſſing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to keep the Peace between them. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more evidently proved, than "the Right of private Judgment for every Man, in the Affairs of his own Salvation," and that both from the plaineſt Principles of Reaſon, and the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Declarations of the Scripture. This is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Reformation, of the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, of all Religion, which neceſſarily implies Choice and Judgment. But I need not labour a Point, that has been ſo often demonſtrated, ſo many Ways. Indeed as every Man believes his own Opinions the beſt, becauſe the trueſt, and ought charitably to wiſh all others of the ſame Opinion, it muſt ſeem reaſonable, the Magiſtrate ſhould have a <hi>publick Leading,</hi> in religious Affairs,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:004347_0121_10044B82D4BE5550"/>but as he almoſt for ever exceeds the due Bounds, and as Error prevails ten Times more than Truth in the World, the Intereſt of Truth, and the Right of private Judgment ſeem better ſecured, by a univerſal Toleration, that ſhall ſuppreſs all Prophaneſs, and Immorality, and preſerve every Party, in the free and undiſturbed Liberty of their Conſciences, while they continue quiet &amp; dutiful Subjects to the State.</p>
            <p>Our Fathers eſtabliſhed a mutual Liberty of Conſcience, when they <hi>firſt Incorporated themſelves:</hi> this they confirmed under their <hi>firſt Patent,</hi> and and at the <hi>Reſtoration,</hi> they <hi>petitioned King</hi> Charles <hi>2d. (Charter)</hi> 
               <q>That they might be permitted, to hold forth a lively Experiment, that a moſt flouriſhing civil State, may ſtand, and beſt be maintained, and that among <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Subjects, with a <hi>full Liberty in religious Concernments,</hi> and that true Piety rightly grounded on Goſpel Principles, will give the beſt and the greateſt Security to Sovereignty; and will lay in the Hearts of Men, the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Obligations to true Loyalty.</q> And the King was pleaſed to make them a Grant, <hi>by which</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>every Perſon may ever freely and fully have &amp; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his own Judgment or Conſcience in Matters of religious Concernment, behaving himſelf peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and quietly, and not uſing this Liberty, for Licentiouſneſs, and Prophaneſs, nor to the civil
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:004347_0122_10044BACDF0617C8"/>Injury, or outward Diſturbance of others.</hi>
               </q> This happy Priviledge we enjoy to this Day, thro' the divine Goodneſs; and the Experiment has fully anſwered, and even beyond what might have been expected, from the <hi>firſt Attempt.</hi> The civil State has flouriſhed, as well as if ſecured by ever ſo many penal Laws, and an Inquiſition to put them in Execution. Our civil Officers have been choſen, out of every religious Society,<note n="‡" place="bottom">It has been no uncommon Sight, to ſee Gentlemen of almoſt every religious Perſwaſion among us, ſitting on the ſame Bench of <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> together. And we may always expect to ſee it, while that Principle prevails, that the ſureſt Way to preſerve and enjoy our Charter Priviledges, is ſo to divide the Poſts of Honour, Truſt, and Profit among all Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions indifferently; and in general, to prefer thoſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, of whatever religious Opinions they are, that are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe beſt qualified, to ſerve the Publick, and adorn their Stations; and to ſuffer no one religious Sect, to monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize the Places of Power, and Authority.</note> and the publick Peace has been as well preſerved, and the publick Councils as well conducted, as we could have expected, had we been aſſiſted by ever ſo many religious Teſts.</p>
            <p>All Prophaneſs, and Immorality, are puniſhed by the Laws made to ſuppreſs them; and while theſe Laws are well executed, ſpeculative Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, or Modes of Worſhip, can never diſturb or injure the Peace of a State, that allows all its Subjects an equal Liberty of Conſcience. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is <hi>not variety of Opinions,</hi> or <hi>ſeperation in
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:004347_0123_10044B85F6FB7468"/>Worſhip,</hi> that makes <hi>Diſorders,</hi> and <hi>Confuſions in Government:</hi> It is the unjuſt, unnatural, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd Attempt to force all to be of one Opinion, or to feign and diſſemble that they are; or the cruel and impious puniſhing thoſe, who can't change their Opinions without Light, or Reaſon; and will not diſſemble againſt all Reaſon, and Conſcience. It is the wicked Attempt to force Men to worſhip GOD in a Way, they believe He hath neither commanded, nor will accept; and the reſtraining them from worſhipping Him in a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, they think He has inſtituted, and made neceſſary for them; and in which alone, they can be ſincere Worſhippers, and accepted of GOD; in which alone, they can find Comfort, &amp; Peace of Conſcience, and approve themſelves before GOD; in which alone, they can be honeſt Men, and good Chriſtians. Perſecution will ever oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion Confuſion &amp; Diſorder, or if every Tongue is forced to confeſs, and every Knee to bow to the Power of the Sword: this it ſelf is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all Diſorders, and the worſt of Confuſions in the Kingdom of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Liberty of Conſcience was never more fully enjoyed in any Place, than here; and this <hi>Colony,</hi> with ſome ſince formed on the ſame Model, have prov'd that the terrible Fears, that Barbarity would break in, where no particular Forms of Worſhip or Diſcipline are eſtabliſhed by the civil
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:004347_0124_1004436D423A4060"/>Power, are really vain and groundleſs;<note n="*" place="bottom">I am aware, ſome ſuch Charges of Ignorance and Barbarity, have been formerly inſinuated, and that the People lived in a State of <hi>Anarchy;</hi> but I hope, I have ſaid enough, to ſhew the groun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It ſubſiſted ſo for the firſt <hi>three hundred</hi> Years; yea, in Oppoſition and Defiance to all the Powers of Hell and Earth. And 'tis amazing to hear thoſe who plead for penal Laws, and the Magiſtrates Right, &amp; Duty to govern the Church of CHRIST, to hear ſuch Perſons, call the early Times, the golden Age of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>However, as the beſt Things, the wiſeſt Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions are ſubject to ſome Inconveniencies, while ſome Good may accidentally follow the very worſt Things in the World, it may be worth our while to conſider, whether ſome Inconveniencies do not naturally, or have not in Fact, followed or attended our Conſtitution. The popiſh Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition it ſelf, which is ſuch an open Tyranny o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Conſcience, and ſuch an abſolute Deſtruction of the Eſſentials of Chriſtianity, and all true Religion, yet keeps up the Face and Shew of the greateſt Decorum, Order, and Harmony imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable. It ought not to be wondred at, if an unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:004347_0125_10044B8901201DD0"/>Toleration of every Doctrine, or Form of Chriſtian Worſhip, tho' never ſo juſt in it ſelf, and ſo uſeful and beneficial in many Reſpects, yet in ſome other Reſpects, may be attended with, or productive of ſome Inconveniencies. We know ſome followed on the Goſpel itſelf. It can't be wondred at, if ſome ſhould make an ill Uſe of this Liberty; yea, if this Liberty it ſelf, ſhould be unhappily a Snare to ſome Men. Have, never any in no Parts of the Colony, appeared loſt, and bewildred in a variety of Opinions round them? At leaſt, is it not likely, there ſhould be ſome Perſons ſo weak and unſtable? Have never any pretended, to think it needleſs, or endleſs, to ſearch after Truth, among ſo many Pretenders to it? And have not ſome, in the Heat and Hurry of Diſpute about the Circumſtantials of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, the Circumſtances of Order, Time, &amp; Place, grown cold or negligent, about the Vitals &amp; Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of the Goſpel Covenant? Hath not too much Zeal about outward Things, too often occaſioned Cenſoriouſneſs, and Uncharitableneſs, and ſtarved the Life of Religion? Is there no Foundation for that Character that has been given of too many among us, that <q>they have a thorough Indifference for all that is ſacred, being equally careleſs of outward Worſhip, and of inward Principles, whether of Faith or Practice." And "that they have worn off a ſerious Senſe of all Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</q> It would be no wonder if ſome or all
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:004347_0126_10044BAE63782F58"/>theſe evil Conſequences, ſhould have followed, in ſome Degree; they have often done ſo in other Places, even where there was not the like fair Occaſion. The Tempter always ſuits his Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to the Circumſtances of thoſe he aſſaults. But theſe Things will be no good Objection againſt Liberty of Conſcience, becauſe infinitely greater Evils, neceſſarily follow on Perſecution for Conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience ſake.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs our own Experience, on the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, and Reproaches of others, will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us to be peculiarly careful, againſt all theſe Evils, and ſome others, that our Conſtitution may be peculiarly liable and expoſed to. Here in a particular Manner, let us be exhorted,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To prevent our <hi>religious Differences, from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever carried into our civil Affairs</hi>—Let them never make Factions in Government.—</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us ſtudy <hi>for Peace,</hi> and to <hi>promote mutual Love among Chriſtians of every Denomination.</hi> We ſhould love all of CHRIST, we ſee in them, and as far as poſſible ſpeak the ſame Things. On the one Hand, we ſhould take heed that Charity and mutual Forbearance don't ſink into Lukewarmneſs and Indifference to the Truth of the divine Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions; and on the other Hand, we ſhould main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain our own Opinions, and manage the Defence of them, when Need requires it, with a Chriſtian
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:004347_0127_1004434EAB311930"/>Spirit of Candour, and Moderation. Eſpecially, let us be warned by our own Hiſtory, to take heed of imputing to others, the Conſequences we think follow from their Opinions; if on the Account of the Conſequences, we can't embrace their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions, yet let us remember, every Man's Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion muſt be taken from his own Underſtanding, and Judgment, and not from the Underſtanding, and Judgment of other Men.</p>
            <p>It is no Pleaſure to any real Chriſtian, to ſee his Brethren, the Diſciples of JESUS CHRIST, ſo divided as they are thro' the World, in their Opinions of various Articles, of his Religion; and much leſs, to ſee them ſo divided in their Affections. Indeed, conſidering the finite Capacity, and the Corruption of humane Nature, we ought to expect a variety of Opinions in Religion, as well as in every Thing elſe. But as the Enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt, make this, tho' unjuſtly, a Reproach to Chriſtianity; and as many weak Perſons, are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away with the Errors of the Wicked, every ſincere Chriſtian can't help wiſhing, that every ſtumbling Block, and Rock of Offence, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved out of the Way, and that all Chriſtians walked in the Truth, with one Conſent of Heart and Voice. It is a Grief to a Chriſtian, as 'tis a Scandal to the whole World, to ſee Chriſtians, (ſo called) full of Envy, and Malice, hating, and reviling one another, and ſmiting with the Fiſt of

This, when all is ſaid and done, is a more full and juſt Argument, that ſuch have no Part in Chriſt, than any ſuppoſed orthodoxy of Opinion, can be of their Intereſt in Him. <hi>For by this</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſhall all Men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye have Love one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> It is a glorious Sight, to ſee the Diſciples of JESUS, live in Love &amp; Peace, and "ſweetly bear with one another in their leſſer Differences:" To ſee every one, keeping the Ordinances, as he thinks CHRIST has commanded him, and at the ſame Time, carefully abſtaining from all Evil, and the Appearances of Evil; and practiſing whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Things are true, honeſt, juſt, and pure; whatſoever Things are lovely, and of good Report.</p>
            <p>When we have Freedom to ſearch the Scripture, and Liberty to believe, and profeſs what we find there revealed, how unhappy would it be, if any ſhould neglect their Priviledge, and be Fools and ſlow of Heart to improve the Opportunity they enjoy? How unhappy would it be, if any ſhould neglect the Worſhip of GOD, and the Inſtitutions of CHRIST JESUS, becauſe they are not enforced by humane penal Laws? Let us be all able ever to give an Anſwer to every one, that asks us a Reaſon of the Hope that is in us, with Meekneſs, and Fear; and let us lay aſide all Wrath, Anger, Malice, Bigotry, and Cenſoriouſneſs; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to pay a univerſal and conſtant Regard
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:004347_0129_10044B8CB5AA0598"/>to the Will of GOD, revealed in his Word. Let us be united to Chriſt Jeſus by a true &amp; living Faith; and let every Man take heed how he build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: <hi>Other F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now if any Man build on this Foundation, Gold, Silver, precious Stones, Wood, Hay, Stubble; every Man's Work ſhall be made manifeſt. For the Day ſhall declare it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſhall be revealed by Fire; and the Fire ſhall try every Man's Work, of what ſort it is. If any Man's Work ſhall be burnt, he ſhall ſuffer Loſs; but he himſelf ſhall be ſaved; yet ſo, as by Fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Above all Things, <hi>let us unite in the practice of Piety and Holineſs.</hi> Let us do juſtly, and love Mercy, and walk humbly with GOD; let us deny all Ungodlineſs, and every worldly Luſt, &amp; live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly, and perfect Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs in the fear of GOD. Theſe Things we may do without any Offence to any Party of Chriſtians. If we be followers of that which is Good, who are they that will harm us, or be offended at us on that Account. Each Party requires all Men, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed from a vain Converſation; every Party owns the Neceſſity, if they differ in the Nature of the Obligation of theſe Duties: Let us then unite in the Practice of them, and have our Converſation, as becometh the Goſpel, which we in common pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs. How unhappy, how inexcuſable, would it
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:004347_0130_10044BB2C62B0678"/>be, if Liberty of Conſcience ſhould degenerate into Licenciouſneſs, and open a Door for a Flood of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities? If while we plead a Right to think, and judge for our ſelves, and reject all meer hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Authority, in Matters of Faith &amp; Worſhip; we ſhould neglect the ſacred Laws of GOD, and the una<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>erable, and eternal Duties of Morality? It is certainly a Reproach to Chriſtians, that they can be ſo zealouſly affected, about the Things, which are peculiar &amp; diſtinguiſhing to each Sect reſpectively, and yet be ſo cold, and negligent of thoſe, wherein they all agree. It is reaſonable to ſuppoſe thoſe Doctrines &amp; Duties, which all agree in, are the moſt important, and eſſential. Let us then be truly concerned to glorify, &amp; ſerve GOD, by a true &amp; ſpiritual Worſhip, and the Vertu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nevertheleſs, the burning Buſh has not been conſumed; the Church has ſtill ſubſiſted, and been reſettled again in Peace and Comfort. Various are the Storms in which this Church has been toſſed; but thro' them all, GOD has preſerved us. May we, and our Succeſſors, be as a Name, and a Praiſe to Him, throughout all Generations! Let us pray the Father of Lights, and the Lord of the Harveſt, to revive and proſper his Work in the midſt of theſe Years. May He unite our Hearts to Love Him more, and Serve Him better; and to Love one another, and ſtrive together to promote his Glory, and our mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Edification, and Growth in Grace.

            <p>Let us conſider, whether we make good the Ground of thoſe pious &amp; excellent Chriſtians, who firſt formed this Church; &amp; whether the Succeſſors of Men, ſo holy, and ſo zealous, are not obliged in a ſingular Manner, to imitate them, wherein they followed CHRIST.

I mean not to revive the old Diſpute; I am well ſatisfied, the Difference may be compromiſed, with great Eaſe &amp; Juſtice; but to perſwade each of us to think of this Article, with ſeriouſneſs, &amp; ſuitable Concern. What will it ſignify, which of thoſe Ways is the moſt ſatisfactory, if we our ſelves have no Grounds for Satisfaction, in either of them? And what can excuſe us neglecting to work out our Salvation, and make our Calling &amp; Election ſure, when GOD is working in us to will, and to do, of his good Pleaſure? Alas! how very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon is it for Perſons, who live under the Goſpel, to be very careleſs &amp; unconcerned in this Matter? for many who call themſelves Chriſtians, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume they are ſomething, when indeed they are nothing? and cry Peace, Peace to themſelves, when they are in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and the Bonds of Iniquity; and have no Lot or Part in the Chriſtian Salvation?</p>

The Generations of Men are paſſing away continually. <hi>Not one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> that we know of, is now alive, <hi>of all thoſe who began this Settlement;</hi> and but few remain of the ſecond Generation. Death is daily preying upon us. Should we not then be the more quickned in the ſecuring our eternal Welfare? Should we not do with our Might, what our Hands find to do, before the Night of Death overtakes us?</p>
            <p>Let us remember <hi>we are Strangers and Pilgrims here, as were all our Fathers;</hi> and let us ſeek after a City which is to come, which hath Foundations, whoſe Builder &amp; Maker is GOD. And let us be followers of thoſe, who through Faith &amp; Patience, inherit the Promiſes.</p>
