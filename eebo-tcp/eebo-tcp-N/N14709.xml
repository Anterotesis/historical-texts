            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE HONORABLE ROBERT MORRIS, <abbr>Esq</abbr> FINANCIER GENERAL, OF THE UNITED STATES OF NORTH AMERICA.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <hi>MEN of Letters who flatter the Muses, or think the Muses flatter them, and Men of pretended as well as approved Genius have always claimed the Privilege of inscribing their Flights of Fancy and their amusive Productions to the Great—not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all their pretended Modesty, the Cause of which is soon guessed or sagaciously mistaken by every Reader.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>With this precedent and a different Presumption; I the very Junior of all the Muses Children, have ventured to add Consequence to this Trifle, by introducing it to the World under your Name.—Those who may bestow so much Time as to peruse it will naturally wonder why I did so! I Will candidly confess that was any one to ask me the Question, I could not give them a satisfactory Answer; Perhaps it is of that delicate combination of Ideas that will not bear definition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>There is a Turn in the Ingenious and Studious different from the conceptions of the vulgar, that inspire them with a laudable Ambition of acquiring Fame; while the latter, the bulk of Society, are rather Prone to despise and ridicule, than to palliate or forgive, the Attempts of those who aim to instruct or to please; if not sanctioned by something conspicuous.—This, perhaps, is one Reason why your Name appears here.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Those who write for their own Amusement or Emolument are convinced from Experience, that their Advancement (at first) arises more from some happy Turn or Circumstance than real Merit; and tho' Merit will carry them through at the long Run, the Assistance brought by it alone seldom or never comes Time enough for the Object
<pb facs="unknown:018671_0003_0FA8062275595170"/>
that deserves it.—There is some living Examples, and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of dead ones—Some will suggest to themselves after reading this Paragraph that I am afraid of dying unnoticed—Indeed I own I am; but it is not every Reader that will have Candour enough to believe from what Reason.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>For the Work I will say nothing: I am but too conscious of its Defects and Deficiencies and too well acquainted with your Merits to speak in favour of such a Bagatelle, to so judicious a Patron: It was the Employment of some leisure Hours, and the fattering Encomiums of a few Intimates, who seldom see the Faults of those they respect, made me a little vain to see it published; but while I ingenuously own this, I tremble, for I am well aware that Vanity often ends in Humility.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Words of a Dedication are generally the Language of Panegyrick, either so servily low, or disgustingly Flattering, that they mostly offend Modesty; but I hope I have not merited this Imputation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Little acquainted with the Great, I have not much to Hope from their Influence, and being above the Censures of the malignant, I have little to fear from their Malevolence. But by this Address to you, I have more than one Consolation, — your admiring the Attempt, and forgiving the Execution.</hi>

               <l>GOOD gentle reader, when you choose</l>
               <l>To hear of love, these lines peruse;</l>
               <l>But if you ne'er have felt its force</l>
               <l>Your pleasures here will have no source;</l>
               <l>Then shut the book, and take another,</l>
               <l>The tedious lines will only bother;</l>
               <l>But should some serious hour obtrude,</l>
               <l>With pleasing melancholy mood,</l>
               <l>When every sense devoid of pride,</l>
               <l>Thro' fancy's airy regions ride,</l>
               <l>To mark each feeling of the heart,</l>
               <l>Their changes know, their cares impart,</l>
               <l>And, gathering home the various views,</l>
               <l>Their merits note and worth peruse,</l>
               <l>Then kindly read a line or two,</l>
               <l>The author meant it but for you.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And ah! forgive a young beginner,</l>
               <l>A harmless, youthful, scribling sinner:</l>
               <l>I seldom speak with muse or graces,</l>
               <l>And seldomer have seen their faces;</l>
               <l>The gods I never do invoke,</l>
               <l>The writers say 'tis all a joke,</l>
               <l>For men are grown so wond'rous wife</l>
               <l>They'll scarcely credit their own eyes;</l>

And was a god to come one earth,</l>
               <l>He'd only be a tool for mirth;</l>
               <l>He'd find such treatment from the rabble,</l>
               <l>Such undeserving worthless gabble,</l>
               <l>For so descending from his station,</l>
               <l>That he'd condemn this nether nation.</l>

               <l>When men to gods would shew such spite?</l>
               <l>—Besides, I never deal in rhyme,</l>
               <l>I only write to cheat the time,</l>
               <l>Or please the fair, or look for fame,</l>
               <l>In simple paths unknown to blame;</l>

            <lg>
               <l>The usual pleasures pass'd away</l>
               <l>Like snow before the summer ray;</l>
               <l>Celestial transport fill'd each heart,</l>
               <l>While wanton dalliance play'd its part,</l>
               <l>And each invok'd the gods above</l>
               <l>To witness their superior love.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>'Tis even ſo with every joy,</l>
               <l>'Till sad ſatiety does cloy;</l>
               <l>Our pleasures how to estimate</l>
               <l>We know not till it is too late</l>
               <l>Then foll'd by the reverse we know,</l>
               <l>But know alas! to be our woe.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>But ah! the joys which they had pass'd</l>
               <l>Were too immoderate to last,</l>
               <l>And passion fail'd on Damon's side, —</l>
               <l>'Twas then his angel grew a bride. —</l>
               <l>A perfect wife—a thing for use,</l>
               <l>To make his tea, or slaves abuse.</l>

'Twas now, "you must, or faith you shan't;"</l>
               <l>Before 'twas "ah my dear I cant,"</l>
               <l>"My love, your pleasure is my will,"</l>

               <l>Yet still the semblance is our own,</l>
               <l>Altho' the features be not known:</l>
               <l>And still as nature works her part,</l>
               <l>Or sinks or elevates the heart,</l>
               <l>As age or youth their stations fill,</l>
               <l>As hope or fear possess the will;</l>
               <l>Our erring wishes leads the man</l>
               <l>To combat reasons steady plan;</l>
               <l>Then wond'ring that a change is seen,</l>
               <l>We fall a victim to the spleen;</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Poor Fanny foster'd up in pleasure,</l>
               <l>And ever in the lap of treasure,</l>
               <l>An only child, and petted much,</l>
               <l>As only babys still are such,</l>
               <l>Would wonder how her swain could fit</l>
               <l>Beside her in a surly fit,</l>
               <l>And only answer no or yes,</l>
               <l>But never flatter for a kiss.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>"Ah! Damon tell me are you sick?</l>
               <l>Or is it but a foolish trick.</l>
               <l>To vex your Fanny?—" No! he said,</l>
               <l>And hastily withdrew to bed.</l>
               <l>There Fanny thought to mend the matter,</l>
               <l>But things grew worse instead of better,</l>
               <l>For Damon had not wherewithall</l>
               <l>To answer to her every call;</l>
               <l>Besides for sleep he went to bed,</l>
               <l>And sleep was most in Damon's head;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:018671_0022_0FA806328DAEA3C8"/>
But ah! poor Fanny thought it hard</l>
               <l>To be from something sweet debar'd.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now Damon in the morning's rise</l>
               <l>As Phoebus first illumes the skies.</l>
               <l>For health, he said, was never got</l>
               <l>By any drowsy slothful sot.</l>
               <l>In vain would Fanny bid him stay</l>
               <l>To hug or kiss, or talk or play;</l>
               <l>For pleasures now was grown a trouble,</l>
               <l>Fruitiou proves it but a bubble.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>To mend the case, and to improve</l>
               <l>The pleasures of domestic love,</l>
               <l>A few companions Fanny chose;</l>
               <l>Her school acquaintance most of those;</l>
               <l>Then she could joke and prate and smile,</l>
               <l>And each anxiety beguile:</l>
               <l>Sometimes a party too made up</l>
               <l>To cards and Tea, to dine or sup;</l>
               <l>While Damon like a cypher sat,</l>
               <l>And wondered at their ceaseless chat.</l>
               <l>But mark the end—Now Fanny grows</l>
               <l>Imprudent, and gallants with beaus,</l>
               <l>And leaves her aunt for Damon's arm</l>
               <l>To link along, not thinking harm.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The 'Squire at length perceiving this,</l>
               <l>From Fanny snatch'd a hasty kiss;</l>
               <l>This Damon saw — ran to the 'Squire,</l>
               <l>And satisfaction did desire —</l>
               <l>Then at his wife he gave a look</l>
               <l>Of sad contemptible rebuke.</l>
               <l>The 'Squire his passion did not smoke,</l>
               <l>Concluded Damon was in joke,</l>
               <l>And laugh'd to see him look so odd;</l>
               <l>"This moment, Sir, you shall, by G—d,</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:018671_0023_0FA8063440A17FC0"/>
Give satisfaction," Damon cries,</l>
               <l>With sury flashing from his eyes.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Against the 'Squire his passion rose</l>
               <l>So high at length they come to blows;</l>
               <l>But Damon, worsted in the fray,</l>
               <l>For quarter eagerly did pray.</l>
               <l>Then home he went in woeful plight,</l>
               <l>And scolded Fanny all the night,</l>
               <l>Talk'd incoherent and in sits,</l>
               <l>And seem'd to be beyond his wits —</l>
               <l>That horrid word <hi>divorce</hi> he said;</l>
               <l>And separation fill'd his head.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>His tender partner vex'd to death,</l>
               <l>Unconscious of his angers birth,</l>
               <l>At least of any mal-transgression,</l>
               <l>Requested he might curb his passion,</l>
               <l>O sad hypocrisy! said he,</l>
               <l>To use me thus! — To cuckold me!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus each disquietude we know</l>
               <l>We make ourselves, or deem it so,</l>
               <l>For all the ills which heaven ordain,</l>
               <l>Are little to our artful pain.</l>
               <l>Ingenious still the mind must roam,</l>
               <l>And ransack'd miseries bring home;</l>
               <l>To load a weary groaning life,</l>
               <l>With pain, anxiety, and strife.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Young Fanny, simple as a saint,</l>
               <l>Was ignorant of what he meant,</l>
               <l>And flatter'd, gently chided, sooth'd,</l>
               <l>In hopes his anger would be smooth'd —</l>
               <l>But all in vain — The jealous fiend,</l>
               <l>Had quite engross'd his fickle mind;</l>

                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:018671_0024_0FA80634E4B41288"/>
And ev'n the assurance of his grief,</l>
               <l>To what he feels, would be relief;</l>
               <l>For fear awakens in the brain</l>
               <l>A horrid still disturbing train,</l>
               <l>Which in the place of common evil,</l>
               <l>Puts inmate in the mind a devil.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Three months of petty strife they led,</l>
               <l>And often wish'd each other dead,</l>
               <l>For Damon still was on the watch,</l>
               <l>His wife's unlawful loves to catch;</l>
               <l>But she, poor creature, never had</l>
               <l>So base a notion in her head.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>At last convinc'd beyond a fear,</l>
               <l>Of her fidelity sincere,</l>
               <l>He dropt suspicion, and began</l>
               <l>To act upon a gen'rous plan:</l>
               <l>And like a man of lib'ral mind,</l>
               <l>He own'd his error and grew kind,</l>
               <l>Forgetting discord fear and strife,</l>
               <l>The jarring acids of this life;</l>
               <l>He candidly this truth confest,</l>
               <l>That love's a stranger in the breast,</l>
               <l>Where base suspicions have a part;</l>
               <l>Love claims an undivided heart;</l>
               <l>And very seldom too is found</l>
               <l>Where other virtues don't abound.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Now scorning all his follies past,</l>
               <l>He lov'd his Fanny to the last;</l>
               <l>A little offspring smiling round,</l>
               <l>In which the parents looks were found,</l>
               <l>Endear'd their moments with fresh joy,</l>
               <l>Domestic raptures that ne'er cloy;</l>
               <l>Conjugal sympathy of soul,</l>
               <l>In happy concord held the whole,</l>

Still kinder sweeter to the last,</l>
               <l>They priz'd the present by the past.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Now here the case is very plain,</l>

               <l>And always over rage prevails,</l>

               <l>But Elen still increas'd his smart,</l>
               <l>Nor let him know who had her heart.</l>

               <l>That he himself in love was dead.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The news to Elen soon was told—</l>

               <l>Twas then she blam'd the foolish art</l>

               <l>Distracted calling Edward's name —</l>
               <l>She saw him—stream'd—and thought his ghost</l>
               <l>Was come from the Elysium coast.</l>
               <l>But soon recov'ring, quick she flew</l>
               <l>And round her Edward's neck she threw</l>
               <l>Her arm—"From hence we'll never part!</l>
               <l>" My life, my love, my soul, my heart!</l>
               <l>" And can you, Edward, now forgive,</l>
               <l>" And only for your Elen live!"</l>
               <l>She said: Thus Edward did reply,</l>
               <l>With gladness sparkling in his eye—</l>
               <l>" Long, Elen, had I strove to gain</l>

               <l>" But hope at length drove on by doubt,</l>
               <l>" This last expedient found out,</l>
               <l>" The success equals what I thought,</l>
               <l>" And wins the prize for which I fought —</l>
               <l>" No, never shall we part, my dear,</l>

               <l>Charg'd with the hursting ministers of fate,</l>
               <l>With gloomy visage o'er the western sky,</l>
               <l>Onward they move to tell the danger nigh;</l>
               <l>While in his carr the sun's meridian beam</l>
               <l>With touch aetherial 'wakes the pointed flame,</l>
               <l>In dire commotion through the pugnant cloud,</l>

               <l>The cattle gaze, the birds desert the air,</l>
               <l>And to the shade the hen and chicks repair;</l>

               <l>While all his mind, to phrenzy wrought by fear,</l>
               <l>Aims to repent as danger seems more near;</l>
