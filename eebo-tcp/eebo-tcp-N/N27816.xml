            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>Gentlemen of the Aſſociation,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>TOday you commemorate the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your Society. This anniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary diſcovers the importance of your inſtitution. On the preſent occaſion, we behold, not only the Members of your Aſſociation, every department of the community ſeems to croud about you, and lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably emulate your zeal for improving the arts of our country. The ancients, our forefathers, and we ourſelves, have, by national feſtivals, ever delighted to ſolemnize the events of war; becauſe thoſe events terminated hoſtilities, eſtabliſhed the ſovereignty of empires, and in a manner ſecured the enjoyment of all the tranquility of peace. With ſingular propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, then, do your fellow-citizens unite with you, in the ceremonial of inſtitutions, which cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, unleſs under the auſpices of peace, the offspring of thoſe mighty events. If, at ſuch times, our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual rejoicings have been great, becauſe thoſe events were glorious, our celebration of theſe eſtabliſhments will be had with ſtill greater joy, becauſe they are more uſeful; for even deeds of glory ceaſe to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting, when they no longer have utility; and the effulgence of victory herſelf loſes the power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite admiration, when once ſhe becomes deſtructive. The arts of peace, therefore, to which all other things
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037067_0004_100C43192EC7EBF0"/>
are but ſubſervient, will forever remain moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, becauſe they will forever remain moſt uſeful.</p>
            <p>THIS conſideration greatly heightens the embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment of one who could never without trembling publicly ſpeak on the moſt trivial occaſion. On the ſubject before us, what can he ſay? Every thing has been anticipated by the philoſophizing ſagacity of a Burrill, the dazzling imagination of a Maxcy, and the all-exhauſting copiouſneſs of a Wilſon. I feel the preſumption of my attempt; and nothing could have induced the undertaking, but a moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent wiſh to comply with the requeſt of that order of the community, to which the firſt habits of my life united me. Altho' for this taſk very little quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by nature, and ſtill leſs by the diſcipline of ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtruction; altho' the duration of his reſidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you ſcarcely entitles him to the indulgence of an acquaintance, while the pecuniary circumſtances of his life have hitherto excluded him from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of citizenſhip; yet, Gentlemen, his appearing in this place, before you, and at your appointment, communicates to the Orator of the preſent occaſion, a moſt undoubting aſſurance of your patronizing candour, together with the liberal and polite atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all that numerous, and brilliant concourſe of citizens, which ſeems to croud every part of this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt temple.</p>
            <p>GENTLEMEN, you aſſociated for ſpecifick purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Theſe muſt have been the advancement of the mechanic intereſt, together with the general benefit of the commonwealth. Skill in your Arts and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ufactures, economy in the diſtribution of your be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, and a viligant attention to the intereſts of your order, as they ſtand related to the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, doubtleſs conſtituted the moſt conſiderable objects of your inſtitution. The means of forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe intentions, and the importance of thoſe
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037067_0005_100C431BB5ACA960"/>
objects which your union was formed to ſecure lay before us materials for long diſcourſe. Among theſe, you will ſay, with me, that your anniverſary Orator ought ever to find his theme. If I may be permitted to tell how your deſigns might be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, I would firſt ſolicit your attention to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of your arts; and then ſay a few things concerning their importance. On theſe arts, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I would not be thought to offer a word by way of inſtruction; for altho' the hand of my youth was hardened by the toil of a moſt laborious trade, yet whatever I can advance on theſe ſubjects, muſt be perfectly known to men, who have wiped from their brow the ſweat of mechanic labor through the heat of fifty ſummers.</p>
            <p>NOTHING ſeems to me to comprehend more of the means of your improvement, than your aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and individual independence. Dependence, it is true, is the principle of union throughout mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and moral nature; but, it is alſo true, that inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence is the principle of individuality. It is this which makes each being what it is, and preſerves it in the exerciſe of its conſtituted nature. There is, through all the univerſe, a principle by which each particular being appropriates whatever it acquires to the perpetuation of its own individual exiſtence.— This is but the principle of independence. Under various names we every where behold it. In the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate world, it is called attraction; in plants, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation; inſtinct, in mere animals; reaſon in man; and independence in political aſſociations. Deſtroy this appropriating principle of independence, and nations would diſſolve into unconnected wanderers; men would ceaſe to regard each other, becauſe they would not feel intereſted in themſelves; brutes might wallow in the brook or trample on the green herbage, but they would never make an effort to quench their thirſt, or ſatisfy their hunger; the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037067_0006_100C43205DAC15A8"/>
of ſpring never more could cloth the valley; the rock on which we ſtep would pulverize beneath our foot, and the earth itſelf crumble into atoms too ſmall for diviſibility.</p>
            <p>THOSE beings are moſt perfect in their kind, moſt completely ſubſerve the deſign of their creation, in which this principle is found moſt uninterrupted in its operations. In the inanimate world, it is not often diſturbed, and we, therefore, ſee, that part of the univerſe, unvaryingly ſubſerve the purpoſes of animated, reaſonable and ſocial exiſtence, the great and only deſign of its creation. In plants, this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple is almoſt as ſteady. They vegetate, with near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſame certainty, that rain deſcends from the clouds, or rivers roll away from their ſources. Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals follow their honeſt inſtincts, and travel round the circle of their exiſtence juſt as certainly as ſpring renews the green foliage of the oak. In man, this principle is violated. We ſee him, often raſh, or weak, and undecided. It is becauſe he ſuffers his reaſon, the director of his actions, the principle of his independence, the guardian of his individuality, to remain uninſtructed by knowledge, not ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by frequent diſcipline, and often biaſed by paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Such a reaſon will, one moment, make a thouſand reſolves, and ſupercede them, by a thouſand contrary reſolutions the next; and finally, when it determines to action, that determination is as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the will of another, as that of its poſſeſſor.— Actions, originating from ſuch a will, and ſuch a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, are puny and feeble, like their parents; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prave human nature, and diminiſh individuality by increaſing dependence. It is an informed, ſtrong, and unbiaſed reaſon, which gives energy to his will, and moves a man forward in the orbit of his nature, like the Sun travelling thro' the fields of heaven.— Such men are ſufficient for whatever God deſigned them. They are fraught with exhauſtleſs reſources,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037067_0007_100C4322AF05EB08"/>
and ſeem almoſt ſelf-ſubſiſtent. Men of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite character are ſwallowed up in the common maſs of animated things; and if deprived of ſhapes and names they would not retain one characteriſteric of individuality.</p>
            <p>IN political bodies, this principle is ſtill more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently violated. That ſpirit of independence, which ſupports their exiſtence, and ought to direct all their actions, like the reaſon of an individual, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten becomes weak, unenlightened, and liable to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in a thouſand ways. Every ſociety, like every man, too ignorant, too weak, too puſilanimous, or, in one word, too dependent, to direct its own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will forever find the intriguing, or the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, ready to aſſume the direction of them. As this dependence increaſes, their individuality fades away, until nothing of it remains but the name of their incorporation. It is this huge Leviathan of dependence, ſtretched on the political ocean, which ſwallows up even ſtates and empires.</p>
            <p>When once a corporation has loſt its indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, when once its exiſtence has become merely nominal, the deſigns of its inſtitution, whatever they may have been, muſt be entirely loſt. Let the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of home manufactures be the deſign of an aſſociation, would this improvement be made if this aſſociation were totally dependant on a collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, united to encreaſe the importation of foreign manufactures? If it were formed to encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage benevolence, would it not be deſtroyed by a dependance on an inſtitution to promote parſimony? —If it were inſtituted to advance religion, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, or arts, or ſcience, when once its reſolves, and its actions, were governed by a ſociety on which it was entirely dependant, and the object of whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution was entirely different from its own, would
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037067_0008_100C4326461F0058"/>
not the deſign of its union be loſt in that dependance which thus almoſt annihilates its exiſtence? Let it, therefore, Gentlemen, be remembered that nothing can ſecure, nothing can forward, the deſign of your Aſſociation, when once its independence has depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it.</p>
            <p>THIS independence of corporation, implies the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence of all thoſe individuals who compoſe it. It will not be poſſible to form an independent Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation from individuals who have any other depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies than mutual ones. If each citizen of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States lived, and had no other means of living, but by a penſion from the King of Great Britain, where ſhould we find the independence of the Fed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Government? If therefore, Gentlemen, your Aſſociation be independent, every member of it will be independent.</p>
            <p>THIS independence is a condition below the diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of wealth, and above the ſolicitude of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; it is as far removed from the hurry of want, as from the lazineſs of opulence; it is the parent of leiſure, of that leiſure which ever aſſociates itſelf with conſtant purſuit, and regular employment.— Let us, Gentlemen, enquire how this independence can forward any of the deſigns of your Aſſociation.</p>
            <p>MEN in this condition, with too much of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ever to be idle, and too far removed from want, ever to be hurried in the performance of their labor, will not only finiſh their work with accuracy and ſkill, they will alſo lay the perfecting hand of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement on that art which employs their attention. But the man, who is dependant, who is driven on in the performance of his taſk by the commands of penurious neceſſity, will never have time to give his work a perfect finiſhing. His productions will be the half formed reſult of hurried application; ſcarred
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037067_0009_100C4327CBA47030"/>
by the rapidity of a haſty hand; and among a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of them you will ſearch in vain to find a piece completed by the finiſhing touches of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt. For tho' want has been the ever teeming pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of inventions; yet, like the indigent and wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed mother of a numerouſly multiplied progeny of orphans, this prolifick parent of inventions has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been compelled to leave them, unnurtured, without culture, and rude as when they firſt received their exiſtence. One mechanic of independence will give more perfection to an art, than a hoſt of "lean unwaſhed artificers," who, driven on by penurious dependence "to their daily labours add the night."</p>
            <p>IN all arts there is a ſcience, a ſyſtem of elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rules, or firſt principles, which may properly be denominated their philoſophy. It is the theory of the art; that part of it which ſtands oppoſed to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe; that which exiſts in the mind, not that which employs the hand. Theory teaches the artiſt what to do; practice guides him in the performance. The complete artiſt has, not only accuſtomed his hand to all the curiouſly difficult operations of his trade; but he has alſo made himſelf perfectly maſter of all its whole ſyſtem of ſcientifick principles, and is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely a philoſopher in his own profeſſion. He goes ſtill further, and examines all that world of things which lies immediately ſurrounding his daily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. Nor is this applicable to the leſs toil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome trades only. Even the rough ſon of Mulcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber has ſeen the ſteel redden in the fire, and expand beneath the hammer; but this is not all. He has learned their philoſophy. He knows the power of the ſubtle, active, all ſoftening, all-diſſipating ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and, in a thouſand ways, can call "this fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming miniſter" to aid his hand, and with a philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophick ſkill inſtruct is whither to direct its blazing energies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:037067_0010_100C432A24B6BA38"/>THE man who operates on principle, who u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites theory and practice, who has perfected phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy by experiment, and become more ſkilful in experiment, by the aid of philoſophy, this man in his own trade is more ſage than Newton, more powerful than Franklin, and will produce, whatever of perfection, his art can produce. But before he can do this, he muſt have rendered himſelf indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Little indeed can he philoſophize, who muſt ſtand at the whiſtle of a thouſand dependencies; who ſuffers his mind to feel the whirl of an eternal rota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wants. Independence alone gives time for thought, and beſtows that leiſure in which we can indulge curioſity, and purſue inveſtigation. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, Gentlemen, you would perfect yourſelves as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, you muſt ſecure to yourſelves independence.</p>
            <p>SKILL in art, is the effect of a habit, which, like all other habits, grows from a repetition of preciſely the ſame performance. The foot becomes habitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a frequent trodden path, and we paſs over it with ſuch facility that the diſtance ſeems ſhortened. A man writes his name better than any other word, becauſe he is moſt habituated to writing it. One conſtant, unvaried, and frequent operation, grows into a habit; and that habit gives the hand of the artificer the eaſy, rapid, and dexterous movement, which is denominated ſkill. To perfect ſkill, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the operations of the hand ſhould be as little varied as poſſible. For when we forſake one ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for another, we inevitably loſe ſkill in that from which we departed; becauſe, time obliterates every thing, and thoſe habits which cuſtom has im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on our ſyſtem are worn away by time.— What we acquire in youth, unleſs retained by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant practice, will eſcape from us in age. The mind muſt loſe its ideas, the "right hand its cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning." He then who would perfect his ſkill, muſt conſtantly apply to one trade.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:037067_0011_100C432C787F5D18"/>IT is an obſervation, not leſs true, than ancient, that he, who applies to a multiplicity of trades, will be ſkillful at none of them. If he be, at one time, a ſhipwright, at another, a carpenter, then a ſmith, a taylor, or a ſhoemaker, we ſhould wonder indeed if he were not a bungler at all his trades. I have ſeen men who were ſometimes, farmers, and, ſometimes, artificers; the conſequence was, their lands were wretchedly cultivated, and all their work but half finiſhed. They might have been ſkilful huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, or ſkilful artificers, had they applied to one of theſe occupations only, but, perpetually exchanging, they could not excel in either. Let, therefore, the ſmith remain a ſmith, the carpenter, a carpenter; and each particular artificer uninterruptedly purſue the trade to which from infancy he has accuſtomed his hand; for in this way only can he cheriſh the young habits of his nature, and complete all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions with dexterity, and ſkill.</p>
            <p>THIS can ſeldom be performed, in our country, by the ſons of dependence. Nothing, like unfeeling neceſſity, drives a man round the toilſome circuit of all the trades. A want of employment, at one, hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries him into another; and, the ſame day, you may ſee him ſweating over the ax, driving the ſaw, or ſmoking at the anvil. Independence only will ſave him from theſe viciſſitudes. The independent man will not be hurried in any one employment, nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to purſue many at the ſame time. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore can fix all his attention to one kind of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and give every piece of his workmanſhip a perfect finiſhing.</p>
            <p>I KNOW it may be ſaid, that ſuch a diviſion of labour, as will confine each man to one employment, is the effect of the populouſneſs and luxury of a country, not of the independence of its artificers.— It is true, the wealthy cities of Europe and Aſia, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037067_0012_100C432F8B4F9D58"/>
a market for every production of art. It is true, artificers in thoſe cities ſeldom know the ſweets of independence. They are the poor, pitiful, hirelings of the wealthy, and the powerful; or the abject ſlaves of their own wants and extravagancies. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity alone urges them to ply the hand; and a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude to pleaſe their proud patrons, and ornament their pageantry, drives them to finiſh their work with anxious attention. With them the completion of the artificer is the perfect degradation of the man. They are not only ſervile, but ignorant. In London, where the meagre forms of men are for life confined to pointing needles, or heading pins, we ſhall find them indeed ſkilful in theſe occupations, but ſtupid beyond all conception, and ignorant of every thing except the mere mechanic taſk which daily employs their hands. Their minds are contracted to the narrow dimenſions of their labour; the little trade engroſſes all the little man; and he has quite as much claim to rationality, as the little tools with which he performs his work.</p>
            <p>SURELY our Country would not improve arts and manufactures at ſuch expence. If, for every finiſhed artificer, a citizen muſt be ſacrificed, the gain will be far ſhort of the loſs; and it were better to remain ſatisfied with the rude productions of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practiſed hands, than to degrade a large and intelligent part of the community into pieces of mere mechaniſm. Conſider, Gentlemen, the amazing difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our country, and thoſe which have been pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulated almoſt ever ſince the birth of creation. We have not, and long may we be deſtitute of, the cauſes to perfect arts and manufactures, which have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them perfection in the luxurious regions of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope and Aſia. Here they muſt owe their improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the independence of their votaries; to that independence which, while it gives power to confine their hands to the exerciſe of one art only, leaves their
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037067_0013_100C4331D614B9A8"/>
minds poſſeſſed of leiſure amply ſufficient to ſtudy the principles, the philoſophy of their own profeſſion.</p>
            <p>IF independence be of ſo much importance in the improvements of arts, does it not become a part of our ſubject? Will it not be proper for a moment to turn our attention to the means of acquiring it? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very man may be independent; every man who can ſo controul his own wants, that he will have need of nothing which he has not already obtained, or which it is in the power of any one to withhold from him. Dependence does not inevitably grow out of a multiplicity of wants; nor independence flouriſh amidſt the immenſity of poſſeſſions. We often ſee the independent man clad in plain gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, while the ſons of ſervility are robed in gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous apparel. The whole art of independence conſiſts in keeping our deſires within our power of gratifying them. While we do this, whether the inventory of our goods and chattels be long, or ſhort; whether our power be narrow, or uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, we ſhall lean on no man, we ſhall be influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by no man, but, lords, and ſovereigns of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, we ſhall be maſters of our own reſolves. On the contrary, the moment we ſuffer our wants to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance beyond the line of our ability, neither the wealth of both Indies, nor the power of an ancient Caliph, can elevate us above the proſtrate ſervility of dependence.</p>
            <p>THERE has been introduced into our country a mode of living very unfriendly to this noble ſpirit of which we are diſcourſing. We ſhall be convinced of this, and perhaps diſcover a remedy for this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic diſeaſe, by examining its origin and progreſs. At the cloſe of the revolutionary war, much of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic debt was in the hands of men in needy circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. To relieve their own wants, and ſupport their families, they ſold the price of their toil at a ſmall
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037067_0014_100C433462D484E8"/>
part of the nominal value. This began the firſt act in the great farce of American ſpeculation. The ſale of lands followed; and theſe negociations were carried to an amazing extent. Fortunes on paper were created in a day. Men roſe at once from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nurious obſcurity, and blazed, and dazzled in all the ſplendor of opulence. They revelled in the luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of wealth; became oſtentatious of their riches; built houſes, ſet up equipages, and furniſhed tables merely to ſhew the world how much money they could throw away.</p>
            <p>THIS ſpirit of ſpeculation ſpread, rapidly as the fogs of a vernal atmoſphere, until it had poſſeſſed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very claſs of the community. All were making haſte, not only to be rich, but alſo to be luxurious. The bubble of imaginary wealth raiſed millions to baſk in the blaze of proſperity; millions who evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently beheld in its broad tranſparent boſom all the glories of a new heaven and a new earth. As it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded they were elevated, until its fatal exploſion, and they found themſelves ſtruggling in the dirt from which they firſt emerged.</p>
            <p>BUT when the phantom fled from our deluded country it left behind a foul progeny; it left us all our habits of profuſion and extravagance. The ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple manners and rigid economy of our anceſtors, had been expelled from the nation; the productions of our own ſoil could not regale our faſtidious appetites; the manufactures of our own country were too plain for her proud ſons and daughters; and our wants, originating from this ſource, have reduced us to a ſervile dependence on foreign nations for our food and raiment.</p>
            <p>IT is for you, Gentlemen, if you would be inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, to reſtore primitive plainneſs. In the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican war, when our country ſtruggled with unutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037067_0015_100C4335E9CBFF38"/>
difficulties, how did the ſpirit of our anceſtors walk abroad in the majeſty of independence? Beauty was then clad in garments which her own hand had wrought; and bluſhing in unadorned lovelineſs, felt ſecure of conqueſt without the aid of Aſiatic or Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean auxiliaries. Thoſe who then fought, waited not until they could be robed in purple, and fine li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nen; but, dreſſed from the loom where our mothers toiled to cloath their ſons for the long campaign, they ruſhed from their native hills, terrible in the battles of their country, and victorious over her foes. The temperance, the economy, the ſimplicity, the induſtry of thoſe times, would render our country independent of every nation on earth; and each individual of us entirely independent of all the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of his neighbours, and perfectly maſter of his own reſolves.</p>
            <p>LOOK out, and behold the independence of all creation. The oak grows from the earth, drinks the dewy ſhowers, warms by the rays of ſummer noon, and expands its verdant foliage to the ſweep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breeze of evening; yet, tho' fed, and ſupported, by all the elements of nature, it leans to none of them, but lifts its branches towards heaven, and rears its head aloft in all the majeſty of independence.— The ox on the plain lows without permiſſion from a neighbour grazer. The wolfe aſks not his kindred prowler of the foreſt when he may leave his rocky den, ſtalk down from the mountain, or howl to the diſmal reſponſes of midnight echo. Even the dog, that fawns on man ſo much, begs not a brother dog for leave to bark. Every thing but man pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves its native independence.</p>
            <p>IF, therefore, Gentlemen, independence be the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving principle of the Univerſe; if the brutes by their inſtincts, and the very trees by ſilent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample ſeem to teach it to man; if the influence of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037067_0016_100C433B3ACCB048"/>
it preſerves the exiſtence of nations; if the deſigns of your Aſſociation muſt expire when they ſhall no longer be nurtered by this principle; if in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try your arts cannot flouriſh unleſs they flouriſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its foſtering hand, then let independence be the great myſtery of all your trades, the firſt and laſt maxim of your lives.</p>
            <p>SHOULD any imagine this path to mechanical im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, ſteep of aſcent, and difficult to be trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, let them with me, a little while, contemplate the importance of thoſe arts; and they cannot then want motives to animate, and to urge their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. To ſpeak on this part of the ſubject is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult indeed; for it is ſcarcely poſſible to look out a point of beginning, or to fix any ultimate boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary to diſcourſe. I can ſee nothing; I can think of nothing, which does not hold up to me the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of your arts. Convenience is indebted to them no leſs than ſuperfluity; and it would be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to ſay whether they moſt advance the utilities or the ornaments of life. Is there any thing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, uſeful, or ornamental; is their any thing beautiful, grand, ſublime, or magnificent, among the works of men, which did not originate from them, as naturely, and as neceſſarily as ſtreams originate from their fountains.</p>
            <p>LOOK at your white enſign which to day has waved in the winds of heaven. The world of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanic philoſophy is epitomiſed on that wonderful production of nature's admired copieſt, and arts moſt ingenious pupil.</p>
            <p>WHAT built the numerous cities, what raiſed the vaſt palaces which glitter along the ſhores of our country? What ſpread this town on the banks of a river once rolling its black waves thro' the ſhaggy boſom of a foreſt? Whence thoſe edifices, catching
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037067_0017_100C433CC71AEC88"/>
the gazing attention of the traveller? Whence this temple, reared on ground, where erſt the unhallowed foot of barbarity beat the ſhaded ſod? This lofty temple, whoſe broad front blazes ſo far in the ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beams of evening, whoſe conſecrated dome ſo often re echos with the ſound of morning hallelujahs.— All theſe grew up under the foſtering hand of mechan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic arts; and all theſe are but a ſmall part of their many productions. It would be endleſs to trace them through all their connexions with the moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant tranſactions of man; to tell how by them war is armed with all his terrors; by them peace is robed in all her allurements; by them agriculture "hews the hard rock, and harrows up the plain;" by them commerce freights the wealth of every clime, aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates the nations of diſtant worlds, and encircles e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very region of the earth in one broad horizon.</p>
            <p>THE improvement of mechanic arts in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try will expand into vaſt importance, when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider our immenſe importation of foreign manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. We know that from thence our ſhips are rigged for the ſea; from thence our houſes receive their ornaments; and the very beds on which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ourſelves are fitted up, and ſent to us by fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners. We are, every one of us, dreſſed by other nations. Columbian beauty wraps her white limbs in the lawn of a foreign loom; and the valour of America does not yet diſdain to wear a Britiſh liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery. The materials of which theſe were wrought, perhaps, were worth one hundredth part the price at which we purchaſe them. Nine hundred of every thouſand dollars, paid by us for imported manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, rewards the ſuperior ſkill of the foreign artiſt. Theſe muſt be obtained in exchange for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought productions of our own ſoil. How vaſtly againſt us the balance in this exchange. What a trifle, growing on the plains of Flanders, or the hills of China, will, before it arrives at the hands of one of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037067_0018_100C433E56B4ED60"/>
our huſbandmen, purchaſe the labours of his whole year. I have ſeen the company, at a birth-night ball, glittering in the ſpoils of a hundred ſeaſons. I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine, therefore, if you can, Gentlemen, imagine, a ſubject more important, more intereſting, to our country than the improvement of American arts and manufactures; for until we can excel foreigners, this importation cannot be prevented. Will not, then, the improvement of your arts be a rich re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for all the labour it can coſt you?</p>
            <p>THE importance of your arts will be ſtill more conſpicuous, if we conſider the political influence of that noble ſpirit of independence by which they are cheriſhed and improved. In all countries wealth is power; and therefore the moſt wealthy are the moſt powerful. He, who can ſupport one man, will be more powerful, than he, who cannot ſupport one. If one thouſand pounds a year will feed ten depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, ten thouſand pounds a year will feed one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. Every acceſſion of wealth will produce a new acceſſion of power. Thus it was over all Europe in the days of feudal dominion. The tyrant, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a prince, or a lord, who could, by parceling out his lands, pay the greateſt number of ſoldiers, was ever moſt powerful. Thus it is in the Ottoman realms at this day. The Grand Seignor is ſole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor of all the lands; and theſe conſtitute the whole wealth of the empire. He is, therefore, the unreſiſted, and undiſputed lord, not only of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, but of the lives, of his trembling vaſſals.</p>
            <p>THE genius of our government is not like thoſe; but tho' vaſtly different, it is quite as liable to be wielded by that kind of power. Altho' every thing with us is done by ſuffrage; yet he, who can bring to the place of election, one thouſand, who eat bread from his table, will be as powerful, as a thouſand whoſe wealth can ſupport none of theſe dependents.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037067_0019_100C43416EBD06E0"/>
Here we behold the birth of ariſtocracies; and they grow up, and gather ſtrength, from all thoſe cauſes which collect the wealth of a nation into the hands of a few. Great individual wealth has an influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, hoſtile to the firſt principles of our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. This influence ought to be oppoſed, or, like a troubled ocean, it will break in upon us, and deluge the liberties of our nation. In this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition nothing can be ſo efficient as individual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence; as that ſpirit by which your arts muſt be foſtered, and improved; that ſpirit which will animate every artificer, whoſe habits of life ſet him beyond reliance on the rich, whoſe profeſſional ſkill renders him neceſſary to the luxurious, and whoſe erect and independent ſoul will never lean from its own baſis to ſupport the powerful.</p>
            <p>ALTHO' this country has not felt the effects of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant individual wealth, altho' no proud ariſtoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy hitherto has laid its maſſy hand on this govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; yet if ever accident, or any permanent cauſe, ſhould throw too much wealth into the hands of a few, this ſpirit of power, "this goblin damned," would riſe ſecretly, like "the peſtilence that walketh in darkneſs;" or gathering audacity from an accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the cauſes which firſt gave it exiſtence, it would finally ſtalk abroad at noon-day, in all the haughty forms of uſurped authority, and inſolent oppreſſion. If ever this ſhould happen in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, then would an independence like yours, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence of numerous, intelligent, and reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble citizens, be too mighty for this genius of miſchief, and hie him back to the foul region from which he aroſe.</p>
            <p>THINK not, Gentlemen, that I would degrade your Aſſociation into a democratic club. Theſe clubs are the birth places of party ſpirit. Here young faction is cradled, and nurſed, until with gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantic limbs ſtalking forth he can trample on law,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037067_0020_100C321EE9DECFA0"/>
religion, and humanity. That independence, which I would recommend, is not the independence of a party, but of the individual. It is the independence of a man, and not of a faction. Its votary is of no party, he is of the community. You, therefore, Gentlemen, in guarding againſt the influence of wealth, will never enquire from what department of the community that influence originated. In theſe political efforts, you will never ſtand forth as a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanic aſſociation, but as ſo many unconnected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, taught by long habits of independence, to oppoſe every influence which may riſe up to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow the principles of our government.</p>
            <p>THE importance of your arts will ſhine with the moſt engaging luſtre, when we behold their improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment collecting you together as a benevolent aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation. Altho' our country feeds moſt of her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren with a liberal profuſion, yet many, and many, are the ſons and daughters of want. Truly was it ſaid to mortals; "The poor you always have with you." That hoſt of contingencies which perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally war againſt human hopes, can, and often do, in a day, lay waſte all our expectations. Have you not ſeen thoſe whoſe bounty fed thouſands reduced to the neceſſity of begging? How often death transfixes with one dart two kindred boſoms; and leaves their young orphans, the tender bloſſoms of their love, to be blighted by the cold unkindneſs of a world! Few are the joys of many. They ſeldom taſte the wholeſome meal, or feel the warm garment, or ſee the bright fire. Often do they ſtand the bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed companions of unhouſed nakedneſs, ſhivering in the howling winds of December midnight.</p>
            <p>SHALL they be doomed to ceaſeleſs wretchedneſs? Will not charity nouriſh them in her own boſom? For their relief, and for our joy in relieving them, has not the hand of nature woven the fine filaments of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037067_0021_100C43460EC6F968"/>
compaſſion into the texture of our hearts? That be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, Gentlemen, which your Aſſociation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcates, will never paſs by them on the other ſide of the way. You will cheer their gloomy abodes with the voice of conſolation. You will cauſe the widow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heart to ſing for joy. You will reſcue young in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence from the temptations of cruel neceſſity; and lead thoſe by the hand who have none to direct their ſteps. How then do your arts riſe in importance when benevolence becomes the inſeparable compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of their improvement!</p>
            <p>I FEEL ſtill an additional proof of the importance of your Aſſociation, when I behold aſſembled on the preſent occaſion, ſo large a collection of ſuch Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices. Young Gentlemen, we all rejoice to ſee you here; to me it is doubly grateful. It brings back to memory the days of my own apprenticeſhip. What my Maſter, my Father, then taught me, I will now ſay to you. Be not ſatisfied, before you perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly know, whatever you undertake to learn. If there be any excellence in your trade, if there be any praiſe which can be merited by you, ceaſe not to labor, and to meditate, until you have obtained that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, until you have deſerved that praiſe. Youth is the ſtuff of which your whole characters muſt be wrought. If you waſte this, or work it up into vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious habits your characters will be contemptible, and your lives wretched. The idle boy will be an idle man; the ignorant boy will be an ignorant man; the vicious boy will be a vicious man You never ſaw a man, idle, and ignorant, and vicious, who was not poor, and diſpiſed, and miſerable. If, therefore, you would be happy and reſpectable men, you muſt now be induſtrious, ſober, and thoughtful; you muſt turn your eyes from every temptation, nor even ſet a foot in the path of vice.</p>
            <p>YOU have parents whoſe hearts throb with anxiety
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:037067_0022_100C4347AE424518"/>
for your ſucceſs in life. Your proſperity will cheer them to the very evening of their days; your ruin would carry them ſorrowing to the grave. Your Maſters have this day preſented you to the public; and in this hallowed temple, with the eyes of all this aſſembly upon you, they now conſecrate you to your country. Remember you muſt one day become cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izens, you muſt one day ſolemnize the rites of this ſociety; and when your maſters ſhall be taken from your head, may a double portion of the ſpirit of this inſtitution, like the mantle of the departing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, forever reſt upon you.</p>
            <p>SINCE theſe things are ſo, Gentlemen, what ſhall we ſay? Can you purchaſe the objects of your Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation at a price too dear? Will you reluct at any toil, any perſeverance, any ſacrifice of ſuperfluity? Will you not cultivate thoſe arts which furniſh man with all his accommodations, all his ornaments? What tho' art can never equal nature; tho' ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give that endleſs variety which bloſſoms round the globe; tho' ſhe cannot arrange like the ſyſtem of the Univerſe, nor ſpread over her works the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louring of the rainbow, nor touch them with that poliſh which ſhines on the front of heaven; yet can ſhe continue to invent, and to improve the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe inventions, until the world of art ſhall bluſh with a beauty, almoſt as perfected, as the creation of nature. Shall a country like ours, ſo rich in ſoil, ſo multifarious in productions, ſtoop to depend on other nations for the neceſſaries of life? When will Columbia, like another China, diſtribute her rich wrought manufactures to every nation of the globe? Will you not lure improvement from the embattled ſhores of Europe? Already ſhe ſtands on the margin of the deep, trembling at the thunder of war. How long ſhall ſhe look wiſhfully over the wide Atlantic, and hope in vain to behold the ſail whitening on the horizon; the ſail which ſhall waft her to the boſom of her ſiſter liberty, in the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,

and happy regions of our country? Shall not arts be cultivated? Does not the genius of independence give them to flouriſh into perfection? Yes, that mighty genius of independence, who, ſtrong as the angel wielding the four winds of heaven, holds over our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment the broad aegis of protection, while law, and freedom, and morality, and religion, ſit ſmiling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath its ample ſhade. Is there not in benevolence, in goodneſs, a charm of almighty allurement? Is it not all we love in mortals, all we adore in God? Is it not circled in the embrace of your inſtitution? Does not the tearful eye of diſtreſs every hour call it into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe. Perſevere then, Gentlemen, we know you will perſevere; we know you will purſue the path of improvement; we know you will perfect the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſigns of your inſtitution; and we know while you imitate the handy work of the Great Maſter Builder of the Univerſe, you will feel the full blaze of his divine munificence kindling in your ſouls the ardent glow of benevolence.</p>

               <l>GENIUS of Art when we ſurvey,</l>
               <l>Thy works, our minds with rapture glow,</l>
               <l>The riſing and the ſetting day</l>
               <l>Diſplay thy wonders here below.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Our boſoms own thy magic power,</l>
               <l>Our native dignity we ſcan,</l>
               <l>And feel at every paſſing hour,</l>
               <l>The inborn majeſty of man.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The maſſy pyramids that riſe,</l>
               <l>And o'er the humble cottage frown,</l>
               <l>The lofty towers that prop the ſkies,</l>
               <l>Are monuments of thy renown.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Behold the ſavage quits his bow,</l>
               <l>Forſakes his wild ferocious clan,</l>
               <l>He feels the genial current flow,</l>
               <l>And mellows into ſocial man.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Yon field of flax which ſummer gales,</l>
               <l>Wave as they ſweep along the plain,</l>
               <l>Transformed by art to ſwelling ſails,</l>
               <l>Shall waft our glory o'er the main.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Where mines of min'ral dark and drear,</l>

            <lg>
               <l>COLD was the earth and dark the ſkies,</l>
               <l>No vernal beauty bloom'd,</l>
               <l>The wild flower ſpread its crimſon dyes,</l>

               <l>And ſcarce the cottages of men,</l>

               <l>CONTENT, thou dear object of all our deſires,</l>
               <l>To thee the fond boſom with rapture aſpires;</l>
               <l>Poor mortals deluded thy phantom purſue;</l>
               <l>We never poſſeſs, tho' we keep thee in view.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Had Adam, our father, thy beauty but known,</l>
               <l>Serene as the morning his days would have flown,</l>
               <l>All nations and ages had bow'd to thy reign,</l>

               <l>Dame Nature foreſaw what her ſons would endure,</l>
               <l>And like a fond parent provided a cure;</l>
               <l>She call'd fair Invention her aid to impart,</l>
               <l>That handmaid of Science and glory of Art.</l>

               <l>Fair Science that lately in caverns unknown,</l>
               <l>Repin'd like a veſtal, forlorn and alone;</l>
               <l>On wings of Invention exulting ſhall riſe,</l>
               <l>And meaſure her flight with the bounds of the ſkies.</l>

            <lg>
               <l>Thoſe men whom the love of their country has fir'd</l>
               <l>Who ſmil'd in the arms of applauſe, and expir'd;</l>
               <l>From tombs more reſplendently riſe to the views,</l>
               <l>Applauded by Senates, and ſung by the Muſe.</l>

               <l>All hail then, Invention, thy bleſſings beſtow,</l>
               <l>To brighten the proſpects of mortals below;</l>
               <l>The Arts and the Sciences both ſhall combine,</l>
               <l>With chaplets of glory to cover thy ſhrine.</l>
