            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER I. General deſcription of the country of Algiers. Climate. Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coaſt. Principal cities.</head>
               <p>ALGIERS is a country which derives its name from its metropolis; and extends four hundred and eighty miles in length from eaſt to weſt along the northern coaſt of Africa. Its utmoſt breadth is three hundred and twenty miles, but at the diſtance of an hundred miles from the the ſea-coaſt, that part of Africa becomes a barren deſert, almoſt utterly unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitable either by man or beaſt. Algiers is ſituated between thirty-two and thirty-ſeven degrees of north latitude, which correſponds to that of the United States, from Virginia to Carolina, incluſive. It is bounded on the north, by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean ſea; on the ſouth, by mount Atlas; on the eaſt, by the country of Tunis; and on the weſt, by the river Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via, which ſeparates it from the empire of Morocco.</p>
               <p>The principal rivers, which water the territory of Algiers, riſe in Mount Atlas, and run by a northerly direction into the Mediterranean ſea. They are ſeven in number. None of them has a long courſe, or even is navigable; at leaſt none of them is made uſe of in navigation. It is however likely that they might be made uſe of for this purpoſe, were the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of a more intelligent and induſtrious character; for ſome of them are of a tolerable depth. Such is the groſs ignorance of the natives in whatever concerns domeſtic improvement, that there is not a ſingle bridge over any of theſe rivers. When they are to be croſſed, the traveller hath ſometimes to wander for ſeveral miles in ſearch of a ford, as ferry boats are unknown. If a heavy rain happens to fall, he is forced to wait, till the river returns to its uſual ſize.</p>
               <p>This country conſiſts of eighteen provinces. The climate is remarkably delightful. The air is pure and ſerene. The ſoil is covered with almoſt a perpetual verdure. Extreme heat is not common. This deſcription applies to the lands on the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:026733_0005_0FD1ACDFABEDED08"/>
ſea-coaſt; for as we advance into the country, the ſoil becomes more parched and barren. Indeed a conſiderable part of the back country is a ſavage deſert, abounding with lions, tigers, leopards, buffaloes, wild boars, and porcupines. And it muſt be acknowledged, that theſe animals are not the leaſt amiable inhabitants of this country.</p>
               <p>There are few towns of any conſequence, though when ſucceſſively under the dominion of Carthage and Rome, it abounded with populous cities. Bona is ſuppoſed to be the ſame place with the ancient Hippo, a ſea-port built by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients. It was formerly the capital of the province of Bona. It lies on the Mediterranean ſea, and there is a coral fiſhery near it. It is a town of no importance, and of ſlender popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. In this part of the world, elegant architecture has, for many centuries, been utterly forgotten or deſpiſed. The buildings of Bona, as every where elſe, are therefore mean. It is expoſed to the incurſions of the Arabs. The name of this people is uſed by travellers in a very indefinite manner. Algiers is at the diſtance of ſome hundreds of leagues from Arabia: but as this part of Africa was formerly conquered by that nation, under the banners of Mahomet, the name is ſtill applied to a race of tawny and independent barbarians, who wander in gangs about the country, and unite the double profeſſions of a ſhepherd and a robber. Bona was formerly a magnificent city. Its grandeur is now only to be traced in the ruins of a mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. It has a fortreſs, and a garriſon of three hundred Turks, as the banditti chuſe to call themſelves; a Turk being the moſt reputable title in that country. This circumſtance is alone ſufficient to aſcertain the depth of its wretchedneſs. Theſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers however are not Turks, but the ſweepings of all nations blended together. They are commanded by an aga, who is likewiſe governor of the town. Bona was taken by Charles V. in his expedition to Tunis, but was not long after recovered by its former maſters.</p>
               <p>Conſtantina is ſituated on the river Sef Gomar, forty-eight miles from the ſea-coaſt. It received its preſent name from that of a princeſs, the daughter of the emperor Conſtantine, to whom it was indebted for magnificence. The ſituation is on a peninſula, difficult of acceſs, except towards the ſouth-weſt. It is one mile in circumference, well fortified, and contains many fragments of ancient architecture. In particular there is part of a noble bridge; and near it is a large ſubterraneous aqueduct, which terminates in a caſcade. State criminals are ſometimes precipitated down this place, and daſhed to pieces againſt the rocks at its bottom. A bey reſides here, and has under his command three hundred Turkiſh horſe, and one
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:026733_0006_0FD1ACE5AB163660"/>
thouſand five hundred Mooriſh ſoldiers. This is the account giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by travellers, though it is not likely that the number of the garriſon is always the ſame. In details of this kind, we muſt be contented with the beſt materials that can be had, though ſometimes not entirely above exception. The inhabitants of Conſtantina are ſaid to be opulent and haughty. This city was formerly the reſidence of a race of kings who governed the province of Conſtantina, of which it is the metropolis; but in the year 1520, the whole territory was conquered by Barbaroſſa, that diſtinguiſhed ſcourge of mankind, who annexed it to the government of Algiers. Some ſplendid ruins exiſt in the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of Conſtantina. Upon the ſea-coaſt, at a ſmall diſtance from it, are the traces of a Roman colony, anciently called Colo. It is ſituated on a high rock, and has a garriſon. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining to it is a French factory, to which the Moors bring hides, wax, and wool, for ſale. At no great diſtance are the remains of the ancient city of Stora. It is ſaid that the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous part of this territory is inhabited by a hardy people, who can raiſe forty thouſand fighting men. It is not probable, that thoſe writers who made this affection had ever an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of counting their number. Hiſtory abounds with ſuch random calculations. The vagabond who founded Rome has been ſupplied by the generoſity of ſucceeding hiſtorians, with an army about equally numerous, though it is, at the ſame time, acknowledged, that his <hi>kingdom</hi> was only ſeven or eight miles in length.</p>
               <p>Gigeri is ſituated about fifteen miles from Bona. It contains about fifteen hundred houſes, and the inhabitants are very poor. It is defended by a fort and a ſmall garriſon. The natives of this part of the country are independent and barbarous. They retire, when circumſtances require it, to inacceſſible faſtneſſes, and ſet the dey of Algiers at defiance. Ships, when wrecked on this coaſt, are plundered, and the crews are treated with the utmoſt ſavageneſs. In this reſpect, however, the natives of the territory of Gigeri cannot differ much for the worſe from the reſt of their countrymen; nor is the practice peculiar to Barbary. Scenes of the ſame kind are frequently acted, and if any thing can be ſtill more infamous, are almoſt always acted with impunity, on the coaſt of Cornwall, and other maritime counties of England.<note n="*" place="bottom">There is a ſtory of an Engliſh parſon, whoſe congregation, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time of divine ſervice, heard of a ſhipwreck.

Algerines, with the loſs of their cannon, and moſt of their effects.</p>
               <p>Bugia was formerly the capital of a kingdom of the ſame name. It ſtands at the mouth of the river Major, or Zinganor, about twenty leagues to the eaſtward of Algiers. It is little better than a heap of ruins; a deſcription which applies to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every town in that part of the world. It has three caſtles, two at the port, and one upon a rock, at a ſmall diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them. In the year 1671, a Britiſh admiral took or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, in this harbour, nine Algerine ſhips of war. It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſeldom, that an admiral has been charged with ſuch a laudable commiſſion.</p>
               <p>Steſſa or Steffa is ſituated in a fertile valley, ſixty miles to the ſouth of Bugia, and fifteen miles from the ſea. It exhibits only the melancholy ruins of its former magnificence, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about three hundred miſerable families.</p>
               <p>Tebef was formerly a flouriſhing city, but is at preſent extremely reduced. Zamoura is in the ſame condition. It is defended by a fort. Couco was once the metropolis of a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the ſame name. Its ſovereigns were in the habit of forming alliances with the court of Spain. For this reaſon, the Algerines, in the beginning of the ſeventeenth century, ravag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the whole country, and deſtroyed every town in it. The inhabitants have ſtill ſupported their independence, by taking refuge in the mountainous parts of the country, which are ſaid to be very fertile; but the Algerines prevent them from holding any intercourſe with foreign nations. Biſcara has a fort and garriſon. One of the chief employments of the people here, is to catch and tame lions, tigers, and other beaſts of prey, which they carry for ſale to Algiers. Necanz is one of the pleaſanteſt towns in Barbary. It is watered by an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able river, whoſe banks are adorned with a variety of beautiful trees. The town contains a magnificent moſque and a college for the education of Mahometan ſtudents.</p>
               <p>Oran is ſituated about two hundred and fifty miles weſt of Algiers. It lies partly on a plain, and partly on the aſcent of a hill. It is a mile and an half in circumference and tolerably fortified. But it is unfortunately commanded by ſome of the neighbouring eminences; ſo that a garriſon of ten or twelve thouſand men is neceſſary to defend it with ſucceſs againſt a ſkilful enemy. As the Spaniſh coaſts and merchant ſhips had ſuffered much from the corſairs of this port, Ferdinand, king of Spain, determined to attempt its reduction. For this purpoſe, he tranſported into Africa an army, under the command of his prime miniſter cardinal Ximenes, one of thoſe ſew ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who have not deſerved the deteſtation of mankind.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:026733_0008_0FD1ACEA48D16E58"/>
The wonted good fortune of Ximenes did not, at this junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, deſert him. He had maintained a correſpondence with ſome of the people of Oran; and when the Moors ſallied out to attack the Spaniſh army, their perfidious countrymen ſhut the gates againſt them. Ximenes killed four thouſand of the barbarians, and ſet at liberty twenty thouſand Chriſtian ſlaves. The Algerines, during almoſt two hundred years, made frequent and unſucceſsful attempts to recover the town. At laſt, in 1708, they retook it. In June, 1732, a Spaniſh army was diſembarked not far from Oran. The Turkiſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, his troops, and the inhabitants were ſeized with a panic, and abandoned their fortifications without much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. The victors found in the place an hundred and forty-ſix pieces of cannon, beſides mortars, and at leaſt fifty ſhip loads of proviſions. This latter ſupply contributed much to the preſervation of their new conqueſt. Without it they muſt have run the greateſt hazard of periſhing in the midſt of ſucceſs; as a tempeſt, which laſted for ſeveral days, cut off all intercourſe between the army upon ſhore, and the fleet at ſea. The Moors not long after attacked the Spaniards with great fury, but were finally repulſed with much ſlaughter on both ſides. Oran is ſtill poſſeſſed by Spain.</p>
               <p>Tremeſen was formerly the capital town of a kingdom of that name. It is ſituated ninety miles ſouth-weſt of Oran, ſurrounded by a ſtrong wall and well fortified. It has five gates with draw-bridges before them, and a caſtle containing handſome barracks for the Janiſaries who are in garriſon. Tremeſen while a metropolis was a ſplendid city. It contained one hundred and fifty moſques, and one hundred and ſixty public baths. Since it ceaſed to be the ſeat of an independent government, it hath ſhrunk into ruins and deſolation. The moſques are reduced to eight, and its public baths to four. The inhabitants are extremely indigent.</p>
               <p>Moſtagan ſtands fifty miles eaſt of Oran. This town is built in the form of a theatre opening to the ſea, and ſurrounded on every other ſide with rocks that hang over it. The ruins of an old Mooriſh caſtle ſtand in a ſpace between the rocks, and there is a ſtrong ſtone wall towards the port, with a modern built caſtle, garriſoned by a number of Turks. The citadel is erected upon the ſummit of one of the rocks, and commands both city and territory. The haven is commodious, and the town is well ſupplied with water. The neighbouring moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains are inhabited by a people called Magarabas, who live in tents, poſſeſs a great number of flocks, and pay to the dey of Algiers twelve thouſand crowns annually. There is a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome moſque in this town.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:026733_0009_0FD1ACEC68D8F090"/>
Tenez is ſituated about one hundred miles to the eaſtward of Oran, twenty miles eaſt of Moſtagan, and at a league diſtant from the ſea, where it has a convenient port. There is a caſtle that was once a royal palace, and in which the governor reſides. The fortifications are ſtrong, the garriſon numerous, and the neighbouring territory fertile. This was ſuppoſed to have been the Julia Caeſarea of the ancients.</p>
               <p>Sercelli lies between Tenez and Algiers, about twenty-four miles to the weſtward of the latter. It is defended by a Turkiſh garriſon, and has a port, which will only admit of ſmall veſſels. This was anciently a large and populous city, but is at preſent a poor and deſolate place.</p>
               <p>The ſouthern part of the Algerine territories is inhabited by a wandering race of people, who, like the Tartars, roam from place to place, and live in tents. The country itſelf is hilly, a branch of mount Atlas running through it. The only riches of the people are their numerous flocks and herds. The government exacts a tribute from them, but a bey is obliged to come annually at the head of an army to collect it; and many of them retire to inacceſſible places till the troops are withdrawn, in order to evade the payment.</p>
               <p>Algiers itſelf ſtands on a bay of the Mediterranean ſea. It is built on the ſide of a mountain. The houſes riſe gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually from the ſea-ſhore up the aſcent, in the form of an amphitheatre. The town appears beautiful at a diſtance, when approaching from the water. The moſques, caſtles, and other public buildings have a ſtriking effect; but the ſtreets are narrow, and the houſes mean. The roofs are flat, ſo that the people can viſit each other, at a conſiderable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance in the town without going into the ſtreets. The walls are about a league in circumference, and defended by ſome ſquare towers and baſtions. The port has a pier about five hundred paces in length, which extends from the continent to a ſmall rocky iſland called the Lantern. On this iſland, there is a caſtle with three lines of braſs cannon. The town has five gates, ten great moſques, and fifty leſſer ones, and is computed to contain an hundred thouſand inhabitants. The fortifications are extenſive and ſtrong. The Chriſtian ſlaves are often employed in removing ſtones from a quarry, at ſome diſtance in the country, which they lay on the ſand, to defend the mole from the impetuoſity of the waves. This laborious work is never at an end, becauſe the ſea conſtantly waſhes away the ſtones, and makes a perpetual ſupply neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. One ſtreet, which is broad and handſome, paſſes through the town from eaſt to weſt; but all the other ſtreets are narrow, incommodious, and dirty. There are ſaid to be
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:026733_0010_0FD1ACEEC0433ED8"/>
fifteen thouſand houſes, which are commonly built round a ſmall ſquare with a paved court in the centre. Around this court is a double range of galleries, one above the other, and both ſupported by columns. The palace of the dey ſtands in the centre of the city. This building is very extenſive, and ſurrounded by two ſuperb galleries, ſupported by marble pillars. There is a law here, by which any woman con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of amorous correſpondence with a Chriſtian, is thrown into the ſea, with her head tied up in a ſack, unleſs her lover chuſes to turn Mahometan. Examples of this kind are not unfrequent, as the fair ſex, in that part of the world, are ſaid to be remarkably frail. Six of the baths have been converted into priſons for the Chriſtian ſlaves. In each of theſe, there is a chapel for the free exerciſe of their religion. Every ſlave is let out at a certain hour in the morning, and muſt return at a ſtated hour at night, in order to be locked up. Each of them is allowed a matraſs and a rug for a bed. There are ſeveral tolerable edifices without the walls of the town, which add to the beauty of the environs. Among theſe are a variety of Turkiſh ſepulchres and monuments. One of theſe monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments contains ſix magnificent tombs of a circular figure. They were erected to the memory of ſix deys, who were, in the courſe of a few days, ſucceſſively elected and murdered. There is perhaps no nation in the world from which we may not learn ſome uſeful leſſon. With reſpect to the burial of their dead, travellers inform us, that the Mahometans diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a degree of delicacy, of which Chriſtians have no concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In our church yards, nothing is more common, and ſurely nothing can be more completely ſhocking, than to ſee graves broke up, a ſecond time, before the perſon has returned to his original duſt; and the remains of the dead are toſſed about with as little ceremony as poſſible. This wretched violation of decency ariſes from the orthodox deſire of being buried in holy ground; a practice which has no doubt been encouraged by the parties concerned, for the purpoſe of exacting a high price. Exorbitant demands of this kind have not long ſince been paid within leſs than an hundred miles of Philadelphia. The Algerines, and the other profeſſors of the Mahometan religion, would regard it as an act of the moſt barbarous ſacrilege to diſturb the remains of the dead, by open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their graves, at any diſtance of time, or upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatever. Hence their burial grounds in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of a large city are ſometimes ten miles in extent.</p>
               <p>Algiers had formerly nothing but rain water. A Moor, who had been driven from Spain, conſtructed two aqueducts, by which it is now ſupplied with abundance of excellent water
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026733_0011_0FD1ACF25FA10008"/>
from the adjacent mountains. The country around this city is very fertile. Country-ſeats, gardens, and groves of trees are ſaid to be numerous. The Algerines are unacquainted with the art of pruning and grafting trees. Their gardens are not walled, but fenced round with a peculiar ſpecies of fig-trees, which from their prickles, and the compactneſs with which their branches interweave, are well adapted for that purpoſe. Among other rich tracts in the province of Algiers Proper, the great plain of Mettijah is admired for its aſtoniſhing fertility. It is fifty miles in length, twenty in breadth, and includes many villas, fragrant groves, and delightful gardens. The ſoil produces ſuch a profuſion of the moſt delicious fruits, rice, roots, and grain of every ſpecies, that the inhabitants enjoy annually two, and frequently three crops. The hot baths of M<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap>cga, in the neighbourhood of this city, are natural curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſities. The principal one is twelve feet ſquare and four deep. The water is very hot, and when it has filled the larger baſon, runs through into another of a ſmaller ſize, where the Jews bathe, as they are not permitted to uſe the ſame bath, with the Mahometans. Theſe hot fountains are conjectured to proceed from the great quantities of ſulphur, nitre, and other inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable ſubſtances in the bowels of the earth. To this cauſe likewiſe have been aſcribed thoſe earthquakes, to which the whole country, and Algiers in particular, are frequently ſubjected.</p>

               <p>THE preſent inhabitants of the territory of Algiers are compoſed of a multitude of different nations. Among thoſe are the Moors or Moreſcos who were driven out of Spain about the end of the ſixteenth century, and the Arabians who trace their deſcent from thoſe diſciples of Mahomet who former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubdued this country. Levantines, Turks, Jews, and Chriſtian ſlaves, with a croud formed of the poſterity of all theſe different people, make up the reſt of the population. The Moors and Arabs are the moſt numerous. The former compoſe the great body of the inhabitants of the towns. But it may be readily ſuppoſed, that amidſt ſuch a variety of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent races, immenſe numbers cannot be ſaid to belong to any particular tribe or nation whatever. In this country there are many wondering bands of ſhepherds who live together in camps, and remove from one place to another as they want paſture for their herds and flocks, or as any other accidental circumſtance hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026733_0012_0FD1ACF494025468"/>
to make it neceſſary. They ſometimes pay rent to land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords, in corn, fruit, honey, wax, and other productions of the ſame kind. The dey likewiſe demands a tribute. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of the climate renders this ſimple way of living tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though the tents of theſe people are mean, their utenſils of little value, and their lodging filthy. The family and their domeſtic animals lie promiſcuouſly in the tents together, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the dogs, which are left on the outſide as guards. They raiſe conſiderable numbers of bees and of ſilk-worms. They ſubſiſt chiefly on bread, rice and fruit. Wine and ſpirituous liquors are almoſt entirely unknown.</p>
               <p>The dreſs of the men is only a long piece of coarſe cloth wrapped round the ſhoulders, and falling down to their ankles, with a cap of the ſame ſtuff. The women pay ſome more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the ornamental part of dreſs. The children are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to go ſtark naked till ſeven or eight years of age. The Sheik or chief of a tribe wears a cap of fine cloth. Theſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are uſually called Arabs; their cuſtoms, language and religion bear a ſtrict affinity with thoſe of Arabia. They are robuſt and of a ſwarthy complexion. The men are active, the women prolific, and the children healthy. They have neither to encounter the hardſhips incident to the life of a North-American ſavage, nor are their conſtitutions enfeebled, as is ſometimes the caſe in manufacturing towns, by ſedentary and unhealthy employments. When a young man would marry, he drives a number of cattle to the hut where the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of his miſtreſs reſide. The bride is ſet on horſeback and led home, amidſt the ſhouts of a croud of young people, who have been invited to the nuptial feaſt. When ſhe arrives at the hut of her lover, a mixture of milk and honey is given her to drink, and a ſong ſuitable to the occaſion is ſung. She then alights, and is preſented with a ſtick, which ſhe thruſts into the ground, and repeats ſome lines to the following effect: <q>As this ſtick is faſtened in the earth, ſo I am in duty bound to my huſband; as nothing but violence can remove it, ſo death alone ſhall force me from his love.</q> She then drives his flock to water and back again, to ſhew her willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to perform any duty that he may aſſign her. Theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious ceremonies being ſettled, all the company enter the hut, and the evening concludes with the greateſt feſtivity that theſe people are capable of enjoying. Subſequent to the marriage, the wife is obliged to wear a vail. She never ſtirs from the hut for the ſpace of a month, after that time. Theſe are the ceremonies reported to be cuſtomary in celebrating a marriage among the paſtoral tribes of Barbary. But narratives of this kind muſt be received, as biſhop Burnet admoniſhes the reader,

                  <hi>with ſome grains of allowance.</hi> Such uniform regularity is hardly to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among a race of wandering ſhepherds. Perhaps an African critic would turn from our deſcription of his country with as much diſdain, as a citizen of the United States feels in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to peruſe a frothy volume reſpecting North-America, fabricated by ſome of the profeſſional book-builders of Paris or of London.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The following curious circumſtances may ſerve to ſhew what kind of opinion ought to be entertained of the authors of oriental tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels. In the year 1783, an adventurer, who called himſelf a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Greek, publiſhed a ſmall volume entitled <hi>the life of Ali Bey.</hi> It contained ſome romantic ſtories, which the author atteſted as an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witneſs. About this time the court of France had diſpatched into Egypt Monſieur Savary, a gentleman of ſome note in the republic of letters. His buſineſs was to obtain authentic information concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ancient and modern ſituation of that country. He returned, and in due time publiſhed two large volumes, pregnant with learning and ſublimity. Monſieur Volney ſoon after entered the liſts as a third champion. He made a very ſevere attack on the veracity of his French predeceſſor. In particular, he upbraided him with having ſtolen a great number of pages, from a very contemptible impoſture which pretended to be a <hi>life of Ali Bey.</hi> This biographer, as an evidence, perhaps, of his claſſical pedigree, had aſſumed the name of <hi>Coſmopolitos.</hi> Volney added that a copy of the book having by chance come to Egypt, while he was there, the European merchants in that province could not help expreſſing their ſurprize, that their country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were ſtupid enough to digeſt ſuch ridiculous reveries. Monſieur Savary did not long ſurvive this humiliating diſcovery. But the "Modern Greek" replied in a volume of letters, which he inſcribed by permiſſion to Sir William Fordyce, an eminent Engliſh phyſician. In this work he affirms that Volney himſelf wrote HIS travels <hi>in a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret at London.</hi> BELLA! HORRIDA BELLA!</p>
                     <p>It is certainly, though not generally known, that the letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montague are the offſpring of a mercantile pen. Even Baron Tott, and Mr. Bruce, though writers of <hi>comparative</hi> authenticity, require in the reader, ſtrong and frequent doſes of faith.</p>

               <p>The Moors or Arabs, for the two names appear to be ſynonymous, are good horſemen, but great thieves. Their principal arms are a ſhort lance and a ſcymitar, though they are likewiſe acquainted with the bow and the muſket. It is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to travel in the country, for fear of being robbed; but perſons are ſaid to be in ſafety, if attended by one of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan Marabouts or hermits. The inhabitants of the ſea-coaſt are perfectly verſant in the uſe of fire-arms.</p>

It is however a military republic, though it certainly can reflect no luſtre on that ſpecies of government. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ordinances run in theſe words: <q>We, the great, and ſmall members of the mighty and invincible militia of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers,</q> &amp;c. The dey is elected by a divan compoſed from the army. He ſeldom ſecures his office, without tumult and bloodſhed; and he often falls by the dagger of an aſſaſſin. This ſovereign may with peculiar propriety adopt the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of one of the heroes of Oſſian: <q>I was born in the midſt of battles, and my ſteps muſt move in blood to the tomb.</q> The way in which his authority is exerciſed, correſponds with that by which it has been obtained. When Mr. Bruce, as Britiſh reſident at Algiers, had occaſion to viſit the dey, he ſometimes found him in his hall of audience, with his clothes all beſpattered with blood, like thoſe of a carcaſe butcher. It is a very frequent amuſement with him, to cauſe the heads of his ſubjects to be ſtruck off in his preſence. Mr. Bruce ſaid, that he knew of one man, who was executed, for no greater offence than becauſe a gun-flint was found upon him. His indictment and trial were very conciſe. <q>You raſcal, what buſineſs have you with a flint, unleſs you were going to conſpire againſt the ſtate?</q>
               </p>
               <p>The aga of the Janiſaries is the officer next to the dey in dignity and power. He enjoys his poſt but two months, and then retires upon a penſion. The other officers of importance are a ſecretary of ſtate, twenty-four Chiah baſſas or colonels ſubordinate to the aga, eight hundred ſenior captains, and four hundred lieutenants. Among theſe officers, the right of ſeniority is ſtrictly obſerved. A breach of this point would be expected to produce a revolt among the ſoldiers, and might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps coſt the dey his life. Beſides theſe officers, there are others belonging to the Turkiſh forces, who form a ſeparate body. The dey has a corps of guards; a very neceſſary, though ſometimes a fruitleſs precaution; as any private ſoldier who has the courage to murder him, ſtands an equal chance of becoming his ſucceſſor. Experiments of this deſcription are ſometimes made. Since the beginning of the preſent cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, ſix private ſoldiers entered into a conſpiracy to kill a dey of one of the ſtates of Barbary. They gave him a mortal wound in his palace, and in the midſt of a croud of people. He expired, exclaiming, "Has nobody the courage to kill a villain?" One of the conſpirators, the intended ſucceſſor, inſtantly aſcended the vacant throne, and brandiſhing his naked ſcymitar, declared <hi>that he would do juſtice to ali!</hi> His five aſſociates went about the hall to inforce the title of their new maſter; and none preſent ſeemed to give themſelves any

diſturbance about what had happened. He kept his ſituation unmoleſted, for about ten minutes, till an old veteran unob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved took aim with a muſket or blunderbuſs, and ſhot him dead. Upon this, the five others were immediately diſpatched by the perſons preſent. But what ſhewed the nature of the government in its proper light was the obſervation of the new dey. He ſaid, that if the uſurper could have held his place for twenty minutes longer, he would have obtained the throne.</p>
               <p>The people of Algiers in general ſpeak a compound of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bic, Moreſco, and the remains of the ancient Phoenician lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages. The natives of all denominations, for the moſt part, underſtand the <hi>Lingua Franca.</hi> This is a kind of dialect, which, without being the proper language of any country on the coaſt of the Mediterranean ſea, has a kind of univerſal currency all over that quarter of the world, as the channel of information for people, who cannot underſtand each other through any medium but itſelf. The public buſineſs of the nation is tranſacted in the Turkiſh tongue, in which alſo the records are kept. It is curious, that in converſation, a Turk tranſpoſes his nouns and verbs, in the ſame way that the Greek and Latin writers have done. Some of our modern critics have been woefully perplexed in attempting to explain this practice, which they ſeem to conſider as peculiar to thoſe two ancient languages. Had they been acquainted with the circumſtance juſt now mentioned, they might readily have ſolved ſome of their doubts by a voyage to Conſtantinople.</p>
               <p>In Algiers, both men and women ſpend a great part of their time in indolence; the men, in drinking coffee and ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the women, in dreſſing, bathing, viſiting the tombs of their relations, and ſauntering in their gardens. The Algerines by their law may have four wives, but they uſually content themſelves with two or three at the moſt. The huſband ſeldom ſees his wife before marriage, but accepts her upon deſcription of a female confident. When the match is agreed upon, the bridegroom ſends a preſent of fruits and ſweetmeats to the bride, and entertains her relations with a feaſt and a muſical entertainment.</p>
               <p>The militia who elect the dey are either Turks or renegado Chriſtians. Their number has been variouſly ſtated by differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent authors from ſix thouſand five hundred to twelve thouſand. The dey pays no other revenue to the grand ſeignior, than that of a certain number of handſome youths, and ſome other annual preſents. His income is more or leſs in proportion to his opportunities of plundering his neighbours or his ſubjects. Dr. Shaw ſays, that the taxes of the whole kingdom produce
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:026733_0016_0FD1AD0954056590"/>
yearly to the dey but about three hundred thouſand dollars. He conjectures that the eighth ſhare of the prizes, the property of perſons who die without children, and to whom the dey falls heir, with the preſents from foreign nations, and his private acts of robbery at home, extend to an equal ſum. It is eaſy to ſee that this calculation muſt be extremely queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable. The tyrant himſelf can hardly be ſuppoſed capable to give a diſtinct eſtimate.</p>

The firſt is the high prieſt of their religion; the ſecond, the ſupreme judge in eccleſiaſtical cauſes, and in ſuch civil matters as the civil power does not interpoſe in. The third is the chief of an order of ſaints or hermits. Theſe three perſons are diſtinguiſhed by the largeneſs of their turbans. They ſit in the divan a little below the dey, on his right hand. The divan itſelf conſiſts of about two thouſand Turkiſh officers and ſoldiers.</p>
               <p>The common puniſhment at Algiers, for offences not capital, is the baſtinado; for thoſe, which are ſo, the bow-ſtring, which two people pull different ways with all their ſtrength, ſo that the criminal is inſtantly diſpatched. The Chriſtian ſlaves are liable to a variety of puniſhments. They are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times burned, or rather roaſted alive. At other times, they are impaled. This is done, by placing the offender on the end of a ſharp ſtake, which is thruſt up his poſteriors cloſe by the back-bone, till it appears above his ſhoulders. Slaves are ſometimes caſt over the walls of a town upon iron hooks. Theſe catch by the jaws, by the ribs, or ſome other part of the body; and the ſufferers have been known to hang thus for ſeveral days, alive, and in the moſt exquiſite torture. Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifixion, by nailing the hands and feet to walls, is likewiſe practiſed.</p>
               <p>A Moor convicted of houſe-breaking, hath his right hand cut off and faſtened about his neck. He is then led through the city on an aſs, with his face towards its tail. Perſons of diſtinction, for crimes againſt the ſtate, are placed between two boards, and ſawed aſunder. Women, detected in adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, are fixed by their necks to a pole, and held under water till they are ſuffocated.</p>
               <p>When an Algerine pirate takes a prize, he examines into the quality and circumſtances of the priſoners If he diſbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves the account that they give of themſelves, they are baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinadoed, till he has met with an agreeable anſwer. Having obtained what information he is able, he brings them on ſhore, after having ſtripped them almoſt naked. He carries them directly to the palace of the dey, where the European
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:026733_0017_0FD1AD0A6009CC28"/>
conſuls aſſemble, to ſee if any of the priſoners belong to their reſpective nations, who are at peace with Algiers. In that caſe, they reclaim them, provided that they were only paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers; but if they have ſerved on board of the ſhips of any people at war with "the mighty and invincible militia," they cannot be diſcharged without payment of the full ranſom.</p>
               <p>Matters are thus ſettled between the dey and the conſuls, what part of the priſoners are to be ſet at liberty, and what part are to be conſidered as ſlaves. The dey has next his choice of every eighth ſlave. He generally chuſes the maſters, ſurgeons, carpenters, and moſt uſeful hands belonging to the ſeveral prizes. Beſides his eighth, he lays claim to all pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of quality, for whom a ſuperior ranſom is to be expected. The reſt are left to the corſair and his owners. They are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the ſlave market; the crier proclaims their rank, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and circumſtances, and the price ſet upon each of them. They are then led to the court before the palace of the dey, and there ſold to the beſt bidder. If any ſum is offered beyond the price firſt ſet upon them, it belongs to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The captors and owners have only that which was originally ſet upon the ſlaves. For this practice of buying and ſelling ſlaves, we are not entitled to charge the Algerines with any excluſive degree of barbarity. The Chriſtians of Europe and America carry on this commerce an hundred times more extenſively than the Algerines. It has received a recent ſanction from the immaculate <hi>Divan</hi> of Britain. Nobody ſeems even to be ſurpriſed by a diabolical kind of advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which, for ſome months paſt, have frequently adorned the newſpapers of Philadelphia. The French fugitives from the Weſt-Indies have brought with them a croud of ſlaves. Theſe moſt injured people ſometimes run off, and their maſter advertiſes a reward for apprehending them. At the ſame time, we are commonly informed, that his ſacred name is marked in capitals, on their breaſts; or in plainer terms, it is ſtamped on that part of the body with a red hot iron. Before therefore we reprobate the ferocity of the Algerines, we ſhould enquire whether it is not poſſible to find, in ſome other regions of the globe, a ſyſtematic brutality ſtill more diſgraceful?</p>

               <head>CHAPTER III. Origin of the preſent government of Algiers. Expedition of Charles V.</head>
               <p>ALGIERS had undergone a variety of revolutions in its form of government, previous to the beginning of the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:026733_0018_0FD1AD0EA8FD4170"/>
ſixteenth century, which it is not within the plan of this ſketch to deſcribe. But about that time a ſudden revolution happened, which, by rendering the ſtates of Barbary formidable to the Europeans, hath made their hiſtory worthy of more attention. Horuc and Hayradin, the ſons of a potter in the iſle of Leſbos, prompted by a reſtleſs and enterpriſing ſpirit, forſook their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's profeſſion, ran to ſea, and joined a crew of pirates. They ſoon diſtinguiſhed themſelves by their valour and activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and becoming maſters of a ſmall brigantine, ſupported their infamous trade with ſuch conduct and ſucceſs, that they aſſembled a fleet of twelve galleys, beſides many veſſels of ſmaller force. Of this fleet, Horuc, the elder brother, called Barbaroſſa from the red colour of his beard, was admiral, and Hayradin ſecond in command. Their names ſoon became terrible from the Straits of the Dardanelles to thoſe of Gibraltar. Together with their power their ambitious views extended, and while acting as corſairs, they aſſumed the ideas, and acquired the talents of conquerors. They often carried the prizes, which they took on the coaſt of Spain and Italy, into the ports of Barbary. The convenient ſituation of theſe harbours, lying ſo near the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt commerical ſtates at that time in Chriſtendom, made the brothers wiſh for an eſtabliſhment in that country. An opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of accompliſhing this project, preſented itſelf, and they did not ſuffer it to paſs unimproved. Eutemi, king of Algiers, having attempted ſeveral times, without ſucceſs, to take a fort which the Spaniſh governors of Oran had built not far from his capital, applied to Barbaroſſa. The corſair, leaving his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Hayradin with the fleet, marched at the head of five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men to Algiers. Such a force gave him the command of the town. He ſecretly murdered the monarch whom he had come to aſſiſt, and proclaimed himſelf king in his ſtead. The authority which he had uſurped, he eſtabliſhed by arts ſuited to the genius of the people whom he had to govern; by liberality without bounds to thoſe who favoured his promotion, and by cruelty no leſs unbounded to all whom he had any reaſon to miſtruſt. He continued to infeſt the coaſt of Spain and Italy with fleets which reſembled the armaments of a great monarch, rather than the ſquadrons of a pirate. Their frequent and cruel devaſtations obliged Charles V. about the beginning of his reign, to furniſh the Marquis de Comares, governor of Oran, with troops ſufficient to attack him. That officer executed the commiſſion with ſuch ſpirit, that Barbaroſſa's forces being van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed in ſeveral encounters, he himſelf was ſhut up in Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſen, and in attempting to make his eſcape was fortunately ſlain.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:026733_0019_0FD1AD0F9EA72330"/>
His brother Hayradin, known likewiſe by the name of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baroſſa, aſſumed the ſceptre of Algiers. He carried on his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val robberies with great vigour, and extended his conqueſts on the continent of Africa. But perceiving that the Moors and Arabs ſubmitted to his government with the utmoſt reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and being afraid that his continual depredations would, one day, draw upon him the arms of the Chriſtians, he put his dominions under the protection of the grand ſeignior, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from him a body of Turkiſh ſoldiers ſufficient for his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity againſt his domeſtic as well as foreign enemies. At laſt, the infamy, or, as Dr. Robertſon calls it, the <hi>fame</hi> of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits daily increaſing, Solyman offered him the command of the Turkiſh fleet; and Hayradin on the other hand, juſtly dreading the conſequences of the tyranny of his officers over the Algerines, ſought the protection of the grand ſeignior. This was readily granted, and himſelf appointed baſhaw or viceroy of Algiers; by which means he received ſuch conſiderable rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcements, that the unhappy Algerines durſt not make the leaſt complaint; and ſuch numbers of Turks reſorted to him, that he was not only capable of keeping the Moors and Arabs in ſubjection at home, but of annoying the Chriſtians at ſea.</p>
               <p>Hayradin ſet about building a ſtrong mole for the ſafety of his ſhips. In this he employed thirty thouſand Chriſtian ſlaves, whom he obliged to work, without intermiſſion, for three years, in which time the work was completed. Hayradin ſoon became dreaded not only by the Arabs and Moors, but alſo by the maritime Chriſtian powers, eſpecially the Spaniards. The viceroy failed not to acquaint the grand ſeignior with his ſucceſs, and obtained from him a freſh ſupply of money, by which he was enabled to build ſtrong forts, and to erect batteries on all places that might favour the landing of an enemy. All theſe have ſince received greater improvements from time to time, as often as there was occaſion for them.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the ſultan, either out of a ſenſe of the great ſervices of Hayradin, or perhaps out of jealouſy leſt he ſhould make himſelf independent, raiſed him to the dignity of baſhaw of the empire, and appointed Haſſan-Aga, a Sardinian rene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gado, to ſucceed him as baſhaw of Algiers. Haſſan had no ſooner taken poſſeſſion of his new government, than he began to purſue his ravages on the Spaniſh coaſt with greater fury than ever; extending them to the eccleſiaſtical ſtate, and other parts of Italy. Pope Paul III. alarmed at this proceeding, exhorted the emperor Charles V<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to ſend a powerful fleet to ſuppreſs thoſe frequent piracies: and, that nothing might be wanting to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the enterprize ſucceſsful, a bull was publiſhed by his holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wherein a plenary abſolution of ſins, and the crown of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:026733_0020_0FD1AD11D95B9B90"/>
martyrdom, were promiſed to all thoſe who either fell in battle or were made ſlaves. The emperor, on his part, needed no incitement, and therefore ſet ſail at the head of a powerful fleet, conſiſting of an hundred and twenty ſhips and twenty gallies, having on board thirty thouſand troops, with an immenſe quantity of arms and ammunition. In this expedition, many young nobility and gentlemen attended as volunteers, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe many knights of Malta, ſo remarkable for their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour againſt the enemies of Chriſtianity. Even ladies of birth and character attended Charles, and the wives and daughters of the officers and ſoldiers followed him with a deſign to ſettle in Barbary, after the conqueſt was finiſhed.</p>
               <p>By this prodigious armament, the Algerines were thrown into the utmoſt conſternation. The city was ſurrounded only by a wall with ſcarce any out-works. The garriſon conſiſted of eight hundred Turks and ſix thouſand Moors, without fire-arms, and poorly diſciplined and accoutred; the reſt of their forces being diſperſed in the other provinces of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, to levy the uſual tribute on the Arabs and Moors. The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards landed without oppoſition, and immediately built a fort, under the cannon of which they encamped, and diverted the courſe of a ſpring which ſupplied the city with water. Being now reduced to the utmoſt diſtreſs, Haſſan received a ſummons to ſurrender at diſcretion, on pain of being put to the ſword with all his garriſon. The herald was ordered to extol the vaſt power of the emperor both by ſea and land, and to exhort him to return to the Chriſtian religion. But to this Haſſan only replied, that he muſt be a madman, who would pretend to adviſe an enemy, and that the perſon adviſed would act ſtill more madly who would take counſel of ſuch an adviſer. He was, however, on the point of ſurrendering the city, when intelligence was brought him that the forces belonging to the weſtern government were in full march towards the place; upon which it was reſolved to defend it to the utmoſt. Charles, in the mean time, reſolving upon a general aſſault, kept a conſtant firing on the town; which, from the weak defence made by the garriſon, he looked upon as already in his hands. But while the divan were deliberating on the moſt proper means of obtaining an honourable capitulation, a mad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, attended by a multitude of people, entered the aſſembly, and foretold the deſtruction of the Spaniards before the end of the moon, exhorting the inhabitants to hold out till that time. This prediction was ſoon accompliſhed in a very ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing and unexpected manner; for, on the 28th of October 1541, a dreadful ſtorm of wind, rain, and hail, aroſe from the north, accompanied with violent ſhocks of earthquakes,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:026733_0021_0FD1AD14921A4700"/>
and a diſmal and univerſal darkneſs both by ſea and land; ſo that the ſun, moon, and elements, ſeemed to combine to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the deſtruction of the Spaniards. In that one night, ſome ſay in leſs than half an hour, eighty-ſix ſhips and fifteen gallies were deſtroyed, with all their crews and military ſtores; by which the army on ſhore was deprived of all means of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence. Their camp alſo, which ſpread itſelf along the plain under their fort, was laid quite under water by the torrents which deſcended from the neighbouring hills. Many of the troops, by trying to remove into ſome better ſituation, were cut to pieces by the Moors and Arabs; while ſeveral gallies, and other veſſels, endeavouring to gain ſome neighbouring creeks along the coaſt, were immediately plundered, and their crews maſſacred by the inhabitants.</p>
               <p>Next morning, Charles beheld the ſea covered with the fragments of ſhips, and the bodies of men, horſes, and other creatures, ſwimming on the waves; at which he was ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heartened, that abandoning his tents, artillery, and all his heavy baggage, to the enemy, he marched at the head of his army, in no ſmall diſorder, towards Cape Mallabux, in order to reimbark in thoſe veſſels, which had out-weathered the ſtorm. But Haſſan, who had watched his motions, allowed him juſt time to get to the ſhore, when he ſallied out, and attacked the Spaniards in the midſt of their hurry to get into their ſhips. He killed great numbers, and brought away a ſtill greater number of captives; after which he returned in triumph to Algiers.</p>
               <p>Soon after this, the prophet Yuſef, who had foretold the deſtruction of the Spaniards, was declared the deliverer of his country, and had a conſiderable gratuity decreed him, with the liberty of exerciſing his prophetic function unmoleſted. It was not long, however, before the Marabouts, and ſome interpreters of the law, made a ſtrong oppoſition againſt him, remonſtrating to the baſhaw, how ridiculous and ſcandalous it was to their nation, to aſcribe its deliverance to a poor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune-teller, which had been obtained by the fervent prayers of an eminent ſaint of their own profeſſion. But though the baſhaw and his divan ſeemed out of policy, to give into this laſt notion, yet the impreſſion, which the prediction of Yuſef and its accompliſhment had made upon the minds of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, proved too ſtrong to be eradicated; and the ſpirit of divination and conjuring has ſince got into ſuch credit among them, that not only their great ſtateſmen, but their prieſts, marabouts, and ſantoons, have applied themſelves to that ſtudy, and dignified it with the name of Mahomet's Revelations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:026733_0022_0FD1AD1EE04EBC98"/>
The Spaniards had ſcarce reached their ſhips, when they were attacked by a freſh ſtorm, in which ſeveral more of them periſhed. A veſſel in particular, containing ſeven hundred ſoldiers, beſides ſailors, ſunk in the ſight of Charles, without a poſſibility of ſaving a ſingle man. At length with much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, they reached the port of Bujeyah. They ſtayed no longer here than till the ſixteenth of November, when they ſet ſail for Carthagena, and reached it on the twenty-fifth of the ſame month. In this unfortunate expedition upwards of one hundred and twenty ſhips and gallies were loſt, with above three hundred colonels and other officers, and eight thouſand ſoldiers and marines, beſides thoſe deſtroyed by the enemy on their reimbarkation, or drowned in the laſt ſtorm. The num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of priſoners was ſo great, that the Algerines ſold ſome of them, by way of contempt, for an onion per head.</p>
               <p>From this time, the Spaniards were never able to annoy the Algerines, in any conſiderable degree. In 1555, they loſt the city of Bujeyah, which was taken by Salab <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, ſucceſſor to Haſſan. This commander, in 1556, ſet out upon a new expedition, ſuſpected to be againſt Oran; but he was ſcarcely got four leagues from Algiers, when the plague, which at that time reged violently in the city, broke out in his grom, and luckily carried him off in twenty-four hours.</p>
               <p>Immediately after his death, the Algerine ſoldiery choſe a Corſican renegado, Haſſan Corſo, in his room, till they ſhould receive further orders from the porte. He did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the baſhawſhip without a good deal of difficulty, but immediately proſecuted the intended expedition againſt Oran, diſpatching a meſſenger to acquaint the porte with what had happened. The army had hardly begun their hoſtilities againſt the place, when orders came from the porte, expreſsly forbidding Haſſan Corſo to begin the ſiege, or, if he had begun it, enjoining him to raiſe it immediately, which he accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly did.</p>
               <p>Corſo had enjoyed his dignity for four months, when Tekelli, a new baſhaw, arrived, as his ſucceſſor from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople. The Algerines reſolved not to admit him; but by the treachery of the Levantine ſoldiers, he at laſt entered. Corſo was thown over a wall, in which a number of iron hooks were fixed. One of theſe catching the ribs of his ſide, he hung three days in horrid agony before he expired. <q>We meet with events in the annals of mankind, that make us doubt the truth of the moſt authentic hiſtory. We cannot believe that ſuch actions have ever been committed by the inhabitants of this globe, and by creatures of the ſame ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies

               <p>Tekelli was aſſaſſinated under the dome of a ſaint, by Yuſef Calabres, the favourite renegado of Haſſan Corſo. The mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer was choſen baſhaw, but died of the plague, ſix days after his election.</p>
               <p>Yuſef was ſucceeded by Haſſan the ſon of Hayradin Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſſa. Not long after, the Spaniards undertook an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt Moſtagan under the command of the count d'Alcandela, but were utterly defeated, the commander him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf killed, and twelve thouſand men taken priſoners. Haſſan having diſobliged his ſubjects, they ſent him in irons to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, while two Turkiſh officers ſupplied his place. Haſſan cleared himſelf; but Achmet, a new baſhaw, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. Upon his arrival at Algiers, he ſent the two deputy baſhaws to Conſtantinople, where their heads were ſtruck off. Achmet, in four months, died; and Haſſan was ſent a third time viceroy to Algiers.</p>
               <p>He ſoon engaged in the ſiege of Marſalquiver, poſſeſſed by the Spaniards, and ſituated near the city of Oran. The Turkiſh ſtandards were ſeveral times planted on the walls, and as often diſlodged; but in the end Haſſan was obliged to raiſe the ſiege.</p>
               <p>In 1567, Haſſan was again recalled to Conſtantinople. His ſucceſſor, Mahomet, incorporated the Janiſaries and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantine Turks together. He thus put an end to their diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and laid the foundation of the Algerine independency on the porte. He likewiſe added ſome conſiderable fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the city and caſtle, which he deſigned to render im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable. At this time, one John Gaſcon, a bold Spaniſh adventurer, formed a deſign of ſurpriſing the whole piratic navy in the bay, and ſetting them on fire in the night time. He had the permiſſion of Philip II. and was furniſhed by him with veſſels, mariners, and fire-works, for the execution of his plan. He ſet ſail for Algiers in the beginning of October, when moſt, if not all the ſhips lay at anchor there; and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced near enough, unſuſpected, to view them. He came accordingly, unperceived by any, to the very mole gate, and diſpatched his men with their fire-works; but theſe were ſo ill mixed, that they could not be kindled. Gaſcon finding himſelf diſcovered, and in the utmoſt danger, ſailed away with all poſſible haſte; but he was purſued, overtaken, and brought back a priſoner. Mahomet immediately cauſed a gibbet to be erected on the ſpot where Gaſcon had landed, and hung
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:026733_0024_0FD1AD241C086440"/>
him by the feet upon a hook, with his royal commiſſion tied to his toes. He had not been long ſuſpended, when the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain who made him priſoner, and a number of other corſairs, interceded ſo ſtrongly in his behalf, that he was taken down, and put under the care of ſome Chriſtian ſurgeons; but two days after, ſome Moors having reported as the common talk and belief in Spain, that the Algerines durſt not hurt a hair of Gaſcon's head, he was hoiſted up by a pulley to the top of the execution wall, and thrown down again. In his fall, a hook catched him by the belly, and gave him a wound, of which he inſtantly expired.</p>
               <p>Mahomet was ſucceeded by <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>hali, a renegado, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the kingdom of Tunis. It remained ſubject to the vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy of Algiers only till the year 1586, when a baſhaw of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis was appointed by the Sultan.</p>
               <p>Algiers continued to be governed, till the beginning of the ſeventeenth century, by Turkiſh viceroys or baſhaws. At laſt, the Turkiſh Janiſaries and militia becoming powerful enough to ſuppreſs the tyrannic ſway of thoſe baſhaws, they ſent a deputation of ſome of their chief members to Conſtantinople to complain of their rapacity. They repreſented to the miniſtry, how much more honourable it would be for the grand ſeignior to permit them to chuſe their own dey, or governor, from among themſelves, whoſe intereſt it would be to ſee that the revenue of the country was rightly applied in keeping up its forces complete, and in ſupplying all other exigencies of the ſtate, without any farther charge or trouble to the porte, than that of allowing them its protection. Algiers was to be wholly left under the direction of the dey and his divan. The power of the Turkiſh baſhaw was to be reduced to a ſhadow.</p>
               <p>Theſe propoſals were accepted by the porte. The divan elected a dey from among themſelves. They compiled a new ſet of laws, and made ſeveral regulations for the better ſupport and maintenance of this new form of government. The ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent altercations that frequently happened between the baſhaws and deys, the one endeavouring to recover their former power, and the other to curtail it, cauſed ſuch frequent complaints and diſcontents at the Ottoman court, as made them ſometimes repent of their compliance.</p>
               <p>In the year 1601, the Spaniards made another attempt upon Algiers. Their fleet was driven back by contrary winds, ſo that they came off without loſs. In 1609, the Moors being expelled from Spain, flocked in great numbers to Algiers; and as many of them were very able ſailors, they undoubtedly contributed to make the Algerine fleet ſo formidable as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſoon after. In 1616, their fleet conſiſted of forty ſhips between two hundred and four hundred tons burthen, and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:026733_0025_0FD1AD256A708080"/>
their admiral was five hundred tons. It was divided into two ſquadrons, one of eighteen ſail, ſtationed before the port of Malaga; and the other at the Cape of Santa Maria, between Liſbon and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>; both of which attacked Chriſtian ſhips, both Engliſh and French, with whom they pretended to be in friendſhip, as well as Spaniards, and Portugueſe, with whom they were at war</p>
               <p>The Algerines were now become formidable to the European powers. The Spaniards, who were moſt in danger, ſolicited the aſſiſtance of England, the Pope, and other ſtates. The French, however, were the firſt who dared to ſhew their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment at the perfidious behaviour of theſe miſcreants; and in 1617, M. Beaulieu was ſent againſt them with a fleet of fifty men of war. He defeated their fleet, and took two of their veſſels. Their admiral ſunk his own ſhip and crew, rather than fall into the hands of the enemy.</p>
               <p>In 1620, a ſquadron of Engliſh men of war was ſent againſt Algiers, but did nothing. The Algerines, becoming more inſolent, openly defied all the European powers, the Dutch only excepted, to whom, in 1625, they ſent a propoſal, that in caſe they would fit out twenty ſail of ſhips in the following year, upon any ſervice againſt the Spaniards, the corſairs would join them with ſixty ſail.</p>
               <p>Next year, the Cologlies, or children of ſuch Turks as had been permitted to marry at Algiers, who were inrolled in the militia, ſeized on the citadel, and had well nigh made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves maſters of the city. They were attacked by the Turks and renegadoes, who defeated them with terrible ſlaughter. Numbers were executed, and their heads thrown in heaps on the city walls.</p>
               <p>In 1623, the Algerines and other ſtates of Barbary, threw off their dependence on the porte. Sultan Amurath IV. had been obliged to make a truce for twenty-five years, with the emperor Ferdinand II. As this put a ſtop to the piratical trade of the Algerines, they proceeded as above mentioned; and reſolved, that whoever deſired to be at peace with them, muſt, ſeparately, apply to their own government. They began to make prizes of ſeveral merchant ſhips belonging to the powers at peace with the porte. They ſeized a Dutch ſhip and poleacre at Scanderoon; they even ventured on ſhore, and finding the town abandoned by the Turkiſh aga and inhabitants, they plundered all the magazines and ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes, and ſet them on fire. About this time, Louis XIII. undertook to build a fort on their coaſts, inſtead of one for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly built by the Marſilians, and which had been demoliſhed. This, after ſome difficulty, he accompliſhed; and it was
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:026733_0026_0FD1AD29DC67F518"/>
called the Baſtion of France; but the ſituation being found in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient, the French purchaſed the port of La Calle, and obtained liberty to trade with the Arabians and Moors. The Ottoman court, in the mean time, was ſo much embarraſſed with a Perſian war, that there was no leiſure to check the Algerines piracies. This gave an opportunity to the vizir and other courtiers to compound matters with the Algerines, and to get a ſhare of the prizes, which were very conſiderable. For the ſake of form a ſevere reprimand, accompanied with threats, was ſent them. They replied, that <q>they deſerved to be indulged in theſe depredations, as they were the only bulwark againſt the Chriſtian powers, and in particular, againſt the Spaniards, the ſworn enemies of the Moſlem name.</q> They added, that <q>if they ſhould pay a punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilious regard to all who could purchaſe liberty to trade with the Ottoman empire, they would have nothing to do but ſet fire to their ſhipping, and turn camel-drivers.</q>

This was no leſs than to retort the piracies of the Algerines, upon themſelves; and as they indiſcriminately took the ſhips of all nations, ſo were theſe heroes indiſcriminately to take the ſhips belonging to Algiers; and this with a ſmall frigate of ten guns! An hundred volunteers embarked; a Malteſe commiſſion was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, with an able maſter, and thirty mariners. On their firſt ſetting out, they took, on the Spaniſh coaſt, a ſhip laden with wine. Three days after, they engaged two large Algerine corſairs, one of twenty and the other of twenty-four guns. The French made ſo deſperate a reſiſtance, that the pirates were not able to take them, till five other corſairs came up. The French veſſel, being almoſt torn to pieces, was then boarded and taken. In 1642, the brothers redeemed themſelves, at the price of ſix thouſand dollars.</p>
               <p>In 1637, the Algerines infeſted the Britiſh channel; and, accordingly to Mrs. Macauley,<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſtory of England, vol.

               <p>The Algerines proſecuted their piracies with impunity, to the terror and diſgrace of Chriſtendom, till the year 1652; when a French fleet being accidentally driven to Algiers, the admiral took it into his head to demand a releaſe of all the captives of his nation without exception. This being refuſed, the Frenchman without ceremony carried off the Turkiſh vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy,

Upon this, the admiral ſent them word, that he would pay them another viſit, next year, with his whole fleet.</p>
               <p>The Algerines fitted out a fleet of ſixteen galleys and gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liots, under the command of Hali Pinchinin. The chief deſign of this armament was againſt the treaſure of Loretto; which they were prevented by contrary winds from obtaining. Hereupon they made a deſcent on Puglia in the kingdom of Naples; where they ravaged the whole territory of Necotra. They carried off a vaſt number of captives. Thence ſteering towards <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>The Venetians, alarmed at ſuch ſavages, equipped a fleet of twenty-eight ſail, under the command of admiral Capello, with expreſs orders to burn, ſink, or take, all the Barbary corſairs which he met with, either on the open ſeas, or even in the Ottoman harbours, agreeable to a late treaty of peace with the porte. On the other hand, the captain baſhaw, who had been ſent out with a Turkiſh fleet to chaſe the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine and Malteſe cruiſers from the Archipelago, learning that the Algerine ſquadron was ſo near, ſent expreſs orders to the admiral to come to his aſſiſtance. Pinchinin readily agreed; but he was overtaken by Capello, from whom he retired to Valona, a ſea port belonging to the grand ſeignior, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Venetian admiral purſued him; but the Turkiſh governor refuſing to turn out the pirates, according to the articles of the peace between the Ottoman court and Venice, Capello was obliged to content himſelf with watching them for ſome time. Pinchinin ſoon ventured out, an engagement immediately enſued, and the Algerines were defeated. Five of their veſſels were diſabled; one thouſand five hundred men, Turks, and Chriſtian <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

Pinchinin, after this defeat, returned to Valona, where he was again watched by Capello, but the latter had not lain long at his old anchorage, before he received a letter from the ſenate, deſiring him to make no farther attempt on the pirates at that time, for fear of a rupture with the porte. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pello was forced to ſubmit; but reſolving to take ſuch a leave of the Algerines as he thought they deſerved, obſerved how they had reared their tents, and drawn their booty and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page along the ſhore. He then kept firing among their tents,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:026733_0028_0FD1AD2EC7289C70"/>
while ſome well manned galliots and brigantines were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to attack their ſhipping. Sixteen gallies, with all their cannon, and ſtores, were towed out. In this laſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement, a ball from one of the Venetian gallies, ſtruck a Turkiſh moſque, and hence, the whole action was conſidered as an inſult to the grand ſeignior. To conceal this, Capello was ordered to ſink all the Algerine ſhips that he had taken, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the admiral; which was to be conducted to Venice, and laid up as a trophy. Capello received a ſevere reprimand, and the Venetians were obliged to buy, with five hundred thouſand ducats, a peace from the porte.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, the news of this defeat and loſs filled Algiers with rage and confuſion. The city was on the point of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, when the baſhaw publiſhed a proclamation, forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, not only complaints and outcries, under the ſevereſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, but all perſons whatever to take their thumbs from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their girdles, while they were deliberating on this ſubject. They applied to the porte for an order, that the Venetians ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in the Levant, ſhould make up their loſs. But with this the grand ſeignior refuſed to comply, and left them to repair their loſſes, and to build new ſhips in the beſt manner that they could. It was not long, however, before they had the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of ſeeing one of their captains land, with a freſh ſupply of ſix hundred ſlaves, whom he had brought from the coaſt of Iceland, whither he had been directed by a miſcreant native taken on board a Daniſh ſhip.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER IV. Pinchinin. His engagement with a Dutch ſhip. Bombardment and deſtruction of Algiers, by the French. Defeat of the Spaniards.</head>
               <p>THE pirates did not long continue in their weak and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs ſtate; being able, at the end of two years, to appear at ſea with a fleet of ſixty-five ſail. The Admiral Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinin equipped four galliots at his own expence; with which, in conjunction with the Chiayah or ſecretary of the baſhaw of Tripoli, he made a ſecond excurſion. This ſmall ſquadron, conſiſting of five galleys and two brigantines, fell in with an Engliſh ſhip of forty guns; which, however, Pinchinin's cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains refuſed to engage, but being afterwards reproached by him for their cowardice, they ſwore to attack the next Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ſhip that came in their way. This happened to be a Dutch merchantman, of twenty-eight guns and forty men, deeply laden, and diſabled by a calm from uſing her ſails.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:026733_0029_0FD1AD3571379FE8"/>
Pinchinin immediately ſummoned her to ſurrender; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving an ironical anſwer, drew up his ſquadron in form of an half moon, that they might pour their ſhot all at once into their adverſary. This, however, the Dutchman avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by means of a breeze of wind which fortunately ſprung up and enabled him to turn his ſhip; by which the galleys ran foul of each other. Upon this Pinchinin ran his own galley along ſide the merchantman, the upper deck of which ſeventy Algerines immediately took poſſeſſion of, ſome of them cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the rigging, others plying the hatches with hand-gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadoes; but the Dutch having ſecured themſelves in their cloſe quarters, began to fire at the Algerines on board, from two pieces of cannon loaded with ſmall ſhot; by which they were all ſoon killed or forced to ſubmit. Pinchinin in the mean time made ſeveral unſucceſsful attempts to relieve his men, as well as to ſurround the Dutch with his other gallies; but their ſhip lay ſo deep in the water, that every ſhot did terrible execution among the pirates; ſo that they were obliged to remove farther off. At laſt the Dutch captain, having ordered his guns to be loaded with cartouches, gave them a parting volley, which killed, as it is ſaid, two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of them, and ſent the reſt back to Algiers in a diſmal condition.</p>
               <p>But though Pinchinin thus returned in diſgrace, the reſt of the fleet quickly came back with vaſt numbers of ſlaves, and an immenſe quantity of rich ſpoils; in ſo much that the Engliſh, French, and Dutch, were obliged to cringe to the Algerines, who ſometimes condeſcended to be at peace with them, but ſwore eternal war againſt Spain, Portugal, and Italy, whom they conſidered as the greateſt enemies to the Mahometan name. At laſt Lewis the fourteenth, provoked by the grievous outrages committed by the Algerines on the coaſts of Provence and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc, ordered, in 1681, a conſiderable fleet to be fitted out againſt them, under the Marquis du Queſne, vice admiral of France. His firſt expedition was againſt a number of Tripolitan corſairs; who had the good fortune to outrow him, and ſhelter themſelves in the iſland of Scio belonging to the Turks. This did not prevent him from purſuing them thither, and making ſuch a terrible fire upon them, as deſtroyed fourteen of their veſſels, beſides battering the walls of the caſtle.</p>
               <p>This ſeverity ſeemed only to be deſigned as a check to the piracies of the Algerines; but, finding that they ſtill continued their outrages on the French coaſt, Du Queſne ſailed in Auguſt, 1682, to Algiers, cannonading and bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barding it ſo furiouſly, that, in a very ſhort time, the whole town was in flames. The great moſque was battered down,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:026733_0030_0FD1AD3771233170"/>
and moſt of the houſes laid in ruins, ſo that the inhabitants were on the point of abandoning the place; when, on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den the wind turned about, and obliged Du Queſne to return to Toulon. The Algerines immediately made repriſals, by ſending a number of galleys and galliots to the coaſts of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence, where they committed the moſt dreadful ravages, and brought away a vaſt number of captives; upon which a new armament was ordered to be got ready at Toulon and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles, againſt them the next year; and the Algerines, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received early notice, put themſelves into as good a ſtate of defence as the time would allow.</p>
               <p>In May, 1683, Du Queſne with his ſquadron caſt anchor before Algiers; where, being joined by the marquis d'Affran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville, at the head of five ſtrong veſſels, it was reſolved to bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard the town next day, when accordingly, one hundred bombs were thrown into it which did terrible execution, while the beſieged made ſome hundred diſcharges of their can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non againſt the aſſailants, without doing any conſiderable damage. The following night, bombs were again thrown into the city in ſuch numbers, that the dey's palace and other great edifices were almoſt deſtroyed; ſome of the batteries were diſmounted, and ſeveral veſſels ſunk in the port. The dey, and Turkiſh baſhaw, as well as the whole ſoldiery, alarmed at this dreadful havock, immediately ſued for peace. As a preliminary, the French inſiſted on the ſurrender of all Chriſtian captives who had been taken fighting under their flag, which being granted, one hundred and forty-two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were directly delivered up, with a promiſe of ſending on board the remainder, as ſoon as they could be got from the different parts of the country. Accordingly Du Queſne ſent his commiſſary general and one of his engineers into the town; but with expreſs orders to inſiſt upon the delivery of all the French captives without exception, together with the effects that had been taken from the French; and that Mezomorto their then admiral, and Hali<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Rais one of their captains, ſhould be given as hoſtages.</p>
               <p>This laſt demand having embarraſſed the dey, he aſſembled the divan, and acquainted them with it. Upon this Mezomorto fell into a violent paſſion, and told the aſſembly, that the cowardice of thoſe who ſat at the helm had occaſioned the ruin of Algiers; but, that for his part, he would never conſent to deliver up any thing that was taken from the French. He immediately acquainted the ſoldiery with what had paſſed; which ſo exaſperated them, that they murdered the dey that very night, and on the morrow choſe Mezomorto in his place. This was no ſooner done, than he cancelled all the articles of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:026733_0031_0FD1AD38DD685DB8"/>
peace which had been made, and hoſtilities were renewed with greater fury than ever.</p>
               <p>The French admiral now kept pouring in ſuch volleys of bombs, that in leſs than three days, the greateſt part of the city was reduced to aſhes; and the fire burnt with ſuch fury, that the ſea was enlightened for more than two leagues round. Mezomorto, unmoved by all theſe diſaſters, and the vaſt numbers of the ſlain, whoſe blood ran in rivulets along the ſtreets; or rather, grown furious and deſperate, ſought only how to wreak his revenge on the enemy; and, not content with cauſing all the French in the city to be cruelly murdered, he ordered their conſul to be tied hand and foot, and faſtened alive to the mouth of a mortar, from which he was ſhot away againſt their navy. By this piece of inhumanity, Du Queſne was ſo exaſperated, that he did not leave Algiers till he had utterly deſtroyed all their fortifications, ſhipping, almoſt all the lower part, and above two thirds of the upper part of the city, which became little more than an heap of ruins.</p>
               <p>The Algerines were now thoroughly convinced that they were not invincible; and, therefore, immediately ſent an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy into France, begging in the moſt abject terms for peace; which Lewis very ſoon granted, to their inexpreſſible joy. They now began to pay ſome regard to other nations, and to be ſomewhat cautious how they wantonly provoked their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. The firſt bombardment by the French had ſo far humbled the Algerines, that they condeſcended to enter into a treaty with England; which was in 1686 renewed upon terms very advantageous to the latter. It is not to be ſuppoſed, however, that the natural perfidy of the Algerines would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear on a ſudden. Notwithſtanding this treaty, therefore, they loſt no opportunity of making prizes of Engliſh ſhips, when they could conveniently ſeize them. Upon ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement of this kind, captain Beach, in 1695, drove aſhore and burned ſeven of their frigates which produced a renewal of the treaty five years after; but it was not until the taking of Gibraltar and Port Mahon, that Britain could have a ſufficient check upon them to enforce the obſervation of treaties; and theſe have ſince proved ſuch reſtraints upon Algiers, that they ſtill continue to pay a greater deference to the Engliſh than to any other European power.</p>
               <p>In 1708, Oran, as has been already related, was taken by the Algerines from the Spaniards, and recovered by the latter in 1732. The Turkiſh baſhaw was in 1710, finally expelled.</p>
               <p>Since the laſt ſiege of Oran the moſt remarkable event in the annals of Barbary is the attack of Algiers, by the Spaniards in the year 1775. With a conciſe account of that expedition, we ſhall cloſe this chapter of blood.</p>

On the 23d of June 1775, a fleet of ſix ſhips of the line, twelve frigates and thirty-three other armed veſſels ſet ſail from Carthagena, in Spain, to attack Algiers. There was on board a body of troops amounting to twenty-four thouſand four hundred and forty-ſeven men, including infantry, caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, marines, and ſix hundred deſerters deſtined to ſerve as workmen. They were commanded by the count O'Reilly, a perſonal favourite of the late king of Spain. They had likewiſe for the land ſervice, an hundred and ſeventy-ſix pieces of artillery, mortars, and howitzers, with a ſuitable quantity of military ſtores. On the 30th of June, and 1ſt of July, they anchored in the bay of Algiers. They obſerved a large encampment, placed behind a battery, eaſt of the river Xarach, which runs on the eaſtward of the city. On the 2d of July, a council was held; and orders were given that the troops ſhould hold themſelves in readineſs to diſembark next morning, by day-break. But as the ſucceeding night was windy, and a ſwell had ſet in from the ſhore, theſe orders were counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. From this day, to the 6th, there were frequent councils, violent debates, and nothing done. A quarrel broke out between O'Reilly and the Marquis de Romana, a Spaniſh major-general, who was killed in the ſubſequent action. On the 6th, the principal officers were again aſſembled, to receive their ultimate inſtructions. The commander in chief warned the army, that it was the cuſtom of the Moors, to pretend a moſt violent attack, and on the ſmalleſt reſiſtance, to fly with precipitation, that they might draw the enemy into an ambuſcade. He cautioned the troops not to break their ranks, as nothing but the force of diſcipline could ſecure them againſt ſo active an enemy. He pointed out the very error which they ſoon after committed, and the ſnare into which they were betrayed. On landing, the army was directed to gain ſome heights, which were ſuppoſed requiſite to enſure ſucceſs againſt Algiers. In the afternoon of the 6th, ſome ſhips of war were ordered to fire againſt three batteries to the eaſtward of that city. This com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was executed with ſo much laudable attention to the perſonal ſafety of the aſſailants, if ſuch we may term them, that their ſhot <hi>did not reach the ſhore,</hi> thoſe of one ſeventy-four gun ſhip excepted. At ſun ſet this formidable attack ceaſed.</p>
               <p>On the 7th at day-break, between eight and nine thouſand men were put on board the boats for landing. They advanced, under the protection of ſome larger veſſels very near the coaſt. Not a Moor appeared to oppoſe them; and at ſeven o'clock in the morning, they <hi>returned on board the tranſports.</hi> Not a ſhot was fired on either ſide, during the whole day.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:026733_0033_0FD1AD3D1F94C338"/>
On the 8th, at day-break, the ſhips being ſtationed to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the different forts to the right and left of the place of diſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkation, the troops, to the number of about eight thouſand, were put on board the boats; which formed in ſix columns. The place of landing was a league and an half to the eaſtward of the city of Algiers. Eighty thouſand Moors, of whom two thirds were cavalry, came in ſight, but did not attempt to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the landing of the Spaniſh forces. It is ſaid, that the whole number of Africans collected on this occaſion, was not leſs than one hundred and fifty thouſand. The troops advanced into a cloſe country, which the Algerines had occupied in ſmall parties. The grenadiers and light infantry of the Spaniards were repulled, and the whole body fell into confuſion. In a very ſhort time they fled, leaving behind them a great number of killed and wounded. The latter, a few excepted, were, in ſpite of their intreaties, left to the <hi>mercy</hi> of the conquerors. Part of a ſecond embarkation of troops added to the general confuſion. A third body had caſt up an entrenchment on the ſhore, for the protection of the army. The Africans attacked it, but were driven back with great ſlaughter on both ſides. The Spaniards, in their gazette, acknowledged the loſs of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty-one men killed, and two thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſeventy-nine wounded. It is ſaid, that the Algerines had between five and ſix thouſand men ſlain on the ſpot. The wounded Spaniards, who were left on the field of battle, were every one murdered by the enemy. The government of Algiers had offered ten zequins for the head of each Spaniard. Fifteen pieces of cannon, and three howitzers were left behind by theſe unfortunate invaders. The real amount of their loſs can hardly have been leſs than three thouſand lives, and was perhaps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably greater. In the gazette of a court, we ſeldom expect an honeſt reckoning of this kind. If the writer of that of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drid intended us to believe that two thouſand two hundred and ſeventy-nine of the wounded were brought off, the officer from whoſe journal this account is extracted, ſays that a much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er number were left behind, than were ſaved, which makes the ſtory worſe and worſe. On details of this kind, we cannot dwell with pleaſure. One circumſtance is evident, that the Spaniſh commanders did not underſtand their buſineſs.</p>

               <head>CHAPTER V. State of America as to Algiers. Conduct of Britain. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding Remarks.</head>
               <p>IN the two laſt Chapters, we have ſeen the Algerines ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively ſet at defiance, ſeveral of the moſt formidable nations of Europe. When the United States of America had obtained their infant independence, it was naturally to be expected, that they alſo ſhould, in ſome degree, ſuffer, by the ravages of the corſairs. Various circumſtances pointed them out, as eligible objects of piratical rapine. They poſſeſſed an extenſive trade with Europe, which in the firſt place, preſented a ſplendid temptation to plunder. There was, on the part of the Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, a ſecond and irreſiſtible motive to hoſtilities. America did not ſupport, at her national expence, any maritime force whatever; and thirdly, had ſhe even eſtabliſhed an armed navy, this country lies at the diſtance of more than three thouſand miles, from the common range of the privateers of Barbary. Hence, to reduce them to ſubmiſſion, muſt always require a proportion of trouble and expence greatly ſuperior to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial magnitude of the object of attack; and this remoteneſs of our ſituation might be conſidered as an additional induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the regency of Algiers for interrupting our navigation. Of the number and ſtrength of the corſairs, it is impoſſible to give an accurate ſtatement. Their actual force, however, compared with that which the United States could eaſily fit out, is but trifling. To bring their whole ſhips of war, at once, to a regular engagement, never can be practicable, but ſhould it happen, it may without preſumption be ſuppoſed, that fifteen or twenty American forty gun frigates would ſend their navy to the bottom. When we reflect on the numerous and peculiar incitements which theſe Africans had, to commence depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the commerce of the United States, inſtead of being ſurpriſed at our having ſuffered ſo much, it rather becomes an object of wonder that we have ſuffered ſo little. The late alarming intelligence from Liſbon has excited univerſal atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the public to that ſubject, which may be divided into two queſtions. Firſt, why, excepting two veſſels,<note n="*" place="bottom">On the 25th of July, 1785, the ſchooner Maria, captain Stephens, belonging to Mr. Forſter, of Boſton, was taken off Cape St. Vincents, by an Algerine cruiſer; and five days afterwards, the ſhip Dolphin, captain O'Brien, belonging to Meſſrs. Irvines, of Philadelphia, was taken by another, fifty leagues weſtward of Liſbon. Theſe veſſels, with their cargoes, and crews, twenty-one in number, were carried into Algiers. Of this number two have been ranſomed by their friends. The remainder now reduced by death to thirteen, are yet ſlaves. In the newſpapers about that time, two or three other ſhips are reported as captured, but upon enquiry, theſe two veſſels only appear to have been ſo.</note> have not

the ſhips of this country met with any interruption ſince the end of the war with Britain? Second, why has our trade now ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſo unexpected and ſevere a check?</p>
               <p>In anſwer to the firſt query, it has happened, that ſince the independence of North-America, the Algerines have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly at war, with the Dutch, or the Portugueſe, or both at once; and as either of theſe nations is greatly ſuperior, in regular ſtrength at ſea, to the corſairs, they have, hitherto, for the ſecurity of their own commerce, watched the entrance of the Mediterranean ſo carefully, that the corſairs have been ſeldom able to get out of it. That they ſometimes did ſo, is unfortunately certain, from the fate of the two American veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels above-mentioned; but, in general, they were ſhot up in the Mediterranean as in a priſon, without a poſſibility of extending their depredations on the Atlantic ocean. Into the former, American veſſels but ſometimes ventured, and when they did ſo, they derived ſecurity from forged or purchaſed Mediterranean paſſes. A Britiſh ſhip has for her protection a paſs, which is written on a large ſheet of parchment, and has, by way of ornament, ſome figures or daſhes drawn with a pen, or engraved on the margin. The Algerines cannot read Engliſh, and it would moſt likely coſt the captain of a corſair his head, were he to carry a Britiſh veſſel, by miſtake, as a prize into the harbour of Algiers. They have adopted a <hi>ſagacious</hi> contrivance to diſcover whether ſuch paſſes are genuine. They keep a ſtick marked with notches correſponding to the ſhape of thoſe figures, that are uniformly delineated on the margin of the parchment. When the paſs is produced, their meaſure is applied. In this was, it cannot be difficult for the moſt bungling artiſt, who has an original paſs before him, to deceive them, and, by this means, it is ſaid, upon repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table authority, that many veſſels have been preſerved. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, even in the Mediterranean itſelf, the progreſs of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerines has been conſiderably cramped by the Portugueſe and Dutch ſhips of war, and both theſe nations, as well as the Spaniards, from a regard to their own intereſt, as well as from the common principles of juſtice and humanity, have been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to extend their protection to the American flag.</p>
               <p>In anſwer to the ſecond query, this protection has, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent been ſuſpended, becauſe a ceſſation of hoſtilities has taken
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:026733_0036_0FD1AD44584BA678"/>
place between Holland and Portugal on the one ſide, and the regency of Algiers on the other. Spain, at the ſame time, has been engaged in the general conſpiracy of the Domitians and Caligulas of Europe, againſt the republic of France; and as this country has contracted the guilt of becoming a free nation, we likewiſe are involved, though, <hi>as yet,</hi> but at ſecond hand, in the vengeance of the imperial and royal Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals. The corſairs of Barbary are now at liberty to attack the veſſels of the United States, not only in the Mediterranean, but alſo in the Atlantic ocean. From the final eſtabliſhment of American independence, ſome attempts are reported to have been made by the American government, to conclude a pacifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with the ſtate of Algiers, but for ſome reaſon or other, theſe attempts have hitherto proved unſucceſsful. The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which have always diſappointed the pacific deſigns of our adminiſtration, deſerve to be inveſtigated.</p>
               <p>Several of our late letters from Liſbon agree in aſſerting, that the preſent peace or truce between Algiers and Portugal has been formed by the officious intervention of England, without the knowledge of the latter. The ſame advices add, and their information is univerſally believed, that this has been done by England, that the corſairs of Barbary might have liberty to interrupt the commerce of this country with Europe. Since the commencement of the unfortunate war, that now ſpreads deſolation and bankruptcy over ſo many countries in that quarter of the world, American bottoms, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were neutral, obtained the preference to thoſe of England in the carrying trade. <hi>They were not liable to be ſeized by French privateers,</hi> and could, therefore, unmoleſted, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the commodities of any one country to any other. This advantage gave our veſſels a decided ſuperiority; and the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an American ſhip frequently received twenty per cent. more for the ſame freight, than would be given to the maſter of an Engliſh veſſel. This humiliating diſtinction alarmed the pride of the Engliſh nation. Diveſted of the carrying trade, the naval deſpotiſm of England would at once ſhrink into nothing. The powers of Europe may reduce her to the natural level of her importance, without the expenſe of firing a ſingle gun. Let them declare, that no veſſel of that country ſhall bring into their harbours, any commodities but thoſe of Britiſh growth or manufacture. Her navy, which has perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated ſuch inceſſant miſchief, would then, if I may borrow the trite quotation from Shakeſpeare, vaniſh, <hi>like the baſeleſs fabric of a viſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Americans, for ſome time time paſt, have been making rapid ſtrides towards her expulſion from the carrying trade.
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:026733_0037_0FD1AD4654C30488"/>
England could hardly venture, at this criſis, to add a ſecond republic to the catalogue of her enemies. She has, therefore, adopted the miſerable expedient of turning looſe the Algerines, that theſe execrable ruffians might plunder our property, and plunge our fellow-citizens into ſlavery.</p>
               <p>Lord Sheffield, in a pamphlet which has obtained more notice than it deſerved, informs the Engliſh nation, <q>That it will not be the intereſt of any of the great maritime pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to protect the American veſſels from the Barbary ſtates.</q> This benevolent remark has received a proper anſwer from the author of "Obſervations" on his lordſhip's pamphlet. The moderation of ſtile, the candour of reaſoning, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtioned authenticity of the facts advanced by Mr. Coxe, deſerve, in an uncommon degree, the attention, and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his countrymen.</p>
               <p>In conſequence of the peace ſo maliciouſly patched up through the interference of the Britiſh, conſiderable havoc has been made on the American commerce, a number of our veſſels having been taken, and the crews, to the number of above 130, carried into the moſt cruel ſlavery. The whole of theſe depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations were committed in the month of October and November 1793. Shortly afterwards, the court of Portugal ordered its veſſels on their old ſtation, and ſince that time, they have kept the corſairs within the ſtraits, and preſerved our veſſels from their rapine.</p>
               <p>When the news of the misfortune of ſo many of our citizens arrived in America, the ſympathy of the public was excited to the higheſt poſſible degree. Committees were appointed in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral places to collect money, for their relief, if not for their ranſom. The committee appointed in Philadelphia for this purpoſe, received conſiderable ſums; from the managers of the new theatre alone nearly one thouſand dollars. But humanity has to deplore, that a moſt unaccountable torpor has taken place of benevolence and charity on this trying occaſion. Curioſity has in vain exerted itſelf to diſcover, why a buſineſs ſo extremely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting, and undertaken with ſo much ardour, has utterly died away, and even ſeemed to have been obliterated from public recollection!</p>
               <p>During the laſt ſeſſion of Congreſs, an act was paſſed em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering the Preſident to purchaſe, or cauſe to be built, a number of veſſels for the defence of the commerce of the United States againſt the Algerines. Theſe veſſels are now building—and it is hoped, from the excellence of their conſtruction, and the acknowledged abilities of the gentlemen appointed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them, that ſhould they ever meet any of thoſe deteſtable pirates, they will fully avenge the injured honour of America.</p>

We are ſorry to inform you, that on the 5th of November, to the date of Captain M'Shane's letter, there were 120 to 130 poor Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans in ſlavery; and this is not the worſt, the piratical beings came out again into the Atlantic the 29th ult. in ſearch of more plunder, and we fear they will do further miſchief. Their cruizing now is contrary to their old ſyſtem of retiring from the ocean in November, and coming out in April; but they never did much harm to the Portugueſe, for ſince our reſidence in this city, half a century, they captured but three brigs, one ſhip, and three or four ſchooners, and carried them into Algiers.

               <p>ON the 18th October, about five leagues from Gibraltar, we were boarded by a zebecque of 20 guns, belonging to this place, who after coming within muſket-ſhot, kept up a conſtant firing with ſmall arms, until they manned our yards from theirs, then the firing ceaſed, and they came down ſword in hand, ſpared our lives, but nothing elſe, having ſtripped us of the clothes we had on, and put us on board the zebecque, which brought us to this place on the 30th ult. when we were taken before the dey, from thence to the canyon, where the ſlaves are kept locked up at night: next day we were all ſent to the marine, and kept at hard labor from day light till dark, with an iron chain which reaches from our legs to our hips; about 50lb. weight, and treated with great ſeverity by our maſters, who allow us nothing but bread and water for our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. The wheel-barrow men in your city lived a genteel life to what we do.</p>
               <p>Our ſituation is truly ſhocking—and how long we can exiſt, God only knows. The carpenter, John M'Farlane, a Scotchman, was taken out of the marine, by the Britiſh conſul—the ſail-maker, John Fogereaux, and two Spaniards, G. Romeo and B. Gazona, were ſold at public auction. On the evening of the ſame day, I arrived here, the following maſters with their crews were brought in—Captains Wallace, Virginia; Newman, Boſton; Taylor, Rhode-Iſland; Furnace, New-Hampſhire: Calder, Glouceſter; Burnham, New-York; Bailey, New bury; Moſs, ditto; Penroſe, Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>The whole number of Americans is between 120 and 130. They treat the Dutch in the ſame manner they do us.—Captain O'Brian and Stephens, with their crews are here, ten of them are living, the reſt dead.—If their ſmall number could not be redeemed, we

have no hopes of relief; therefore endeavour to make ourſelves as happy as poſſible: they aſk for my ranſom 4000 dollars, firſt and ſecond mate, 3000 dollars each, and for each man, 1500 dollars. If a peace is not made, or our ſhips protected, we may expect to encreaſe daily as we are all employed in the marine department, fitting out cruizers. I have not yet learned their force; but as there is no check on them, no American veſſel will be able to go to Europe in ſafety. A courier is arrived from Alicant, informing the dey that colonel Humphreys is there with full power from Congreſs, to make a peace, and waits his permiſſion to come; but the dey, I am informed, had refuſed him.</p>

The dey anſwered, that he would not receive him, either to make peace or redeem the American ſlaves—that he had been ſoliciting the Americans to come and make a peace with this regency for three years paſt, and they had treated his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions with neglect and indifference; and that ſince he had made a truce with the Dutch and Portugueſe, and captured ten ſail of Americans, and likely to take many more, he could not and would not make peace with them: that he made the truce with Portugal for the purpoſe of capturing American veſſels, and could not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be at peace with all nations. The courier returned to Mr. Humphreys at Alicant with the dey's reply—but we have heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ſince.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="unknown:026733_0042_0FD1AD5C37C28940"/>
The terms preſcribed by the dey for the relief of the Portugueſe, is as follows: 1,200,000 Mexican dollars for the treaſury; 600,000 dollars for the dey's voice and the great officers, of the regency, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadorial and conſular preſents—equal to what Spain gave; and the redemption of 75 Portugueſe captains, at 2000 dollars each. On the 7th inſt. the Portugueſe frigate ſailed from Algiers for Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon, with the dey's propoſitions.</p>
               <p>The day following the dey called captain Logie, and deſired he would immediately write to Portugal, that he demanded for his family and friends 600,000 dollars in addition to the terms above expreſſed.</p>
               <p>The Algerine politicians are of opinion, that Portugal will not agree to the dey's demands; but, ſir, I think they will, as they wiſh to extend their commerce, and well know the difficulty of blocking up the Streights, and the vaſt ſums they expend in keeping up the fleets againſt the Barbary States.</p>
               <p>The Dutch truce will expire in twelve days from this date; and if Van Trump is not here in the limited time, away go the rovers in queſt of Dutchmen.</p>
               <p>The Danes, in my opinion, are on the verge of loſing their peace with Algiers. Should theſe three nations be baffled, relative to Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine affairs, then the United States might probably have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of eſtabliſhing a peace; but never on ſo favourable terms as they might have had three years paſt; which neglect will coſt them four millions, together with loſs of trade, inſurance, armaments, and peace redemptions. At all events, the United States have no alternative but to fit out twelve of the beſt ſailing veſſels that can poſſibly be built; theſe cruizers to be properly appointed and complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manned, for all depends on this meaſure. At the ſame time, the door for obtaining a peace ſhould be kept open, and care taken that the United States do not become the dupe and buffoon of all Europe.</p>

               <head>No. VI. Letter from ſundry captive American captains, to colonel David Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phreys, dated Algiers, December 29th, 1793.</head>
               <p>WE the ſubſcribers, in behalf of ourſelves, and brother-ſufferers, at preſent captives in this city of human miſery, return you our ſincere thanks, for your communications of the 29th ult. and for the proviſion you have been pleaſed to allow us, in order to alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate ſomewhat our ſufferings in our preſent ſituation.</p>
               <p>We have drawn up and ſigned two petitions, one to the Senate, the other to the Houſe of Repreſentatives, and we ſhall eſteem it, among the many favors you have rendered us, that you will pleaſe to forward theſe petitions to their reſpective addreſs, ſo that no time may be loſt, but that they be laid before the Repreſentatives of our country, hoping that the United States, will fully provide funds for extricating from captivity, and reſtore us to our country, fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, friend and connections.</p>
               <p>We have peruſed with ſentiments of ſatiſfaction and approbation,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:026733_0043_0FD18CAAB85E9E48"/>
your memorial to the regency of Algiers, and have to obſerve, that its contents fully coincide with our ſentiments on this buſineſs, which we truſt, in the Almighty, will terminate to the honour and intereſt of our common country, notwithſtanding the inſinuations, (of others in this quarter) to the prejudice of the United States.</p>
               <p>We truſt, and hope, that the United States will adopt ſuch ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual plans, in order to prevent any more of our brethren, ſharing our unhappy fate, which unavoidably muſt happen, if ſome ſpeedy and deciſive means is not immediately put in execution, as we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Portugueſe truce, with this regency, was agreed on for one year.</p>
               <p>What damps our ſprits in ſome degree, is, that we are informed, that the plague, that fatal and tremendous diſorder, has given its awful alarm in the country adjacent. And as your unfortunate countrymen are confined during the night time, in the ſlave-priſons, with ſix hundred captives of other nations, from our crowded ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we muſt be expoſed to this contagious diſorder; which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitates the ſubſcribers, to intreat you, ſir, that in this caſe, thoſe our friends, and of influence in this regency, will be authoriſed by you, and our honoured countrymen, Mr. Charmichael, and Mr. Short, to have a houſe taken for the reſidence of the American maſters and mates, and, if poſſible, the mariners, to ſhield them from the threatening ſtorm of mortality and danger.</p>
               <p>We make no doubt, but in caſe of the Almighty's wrath, viſiting this city of iniquity, but the dey and regency would acquieſce to the propoſed plan of humanity, which would be eſtabliſhing an example for the general welfare of mankind—and would to poſterity be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded to the immortal honor of the United States.</p>
               <p>The ſame time, honoured ſir, and friend, be you aſſured, for your conſolation, that we the American captives, in this city of bondage, will bear our ſufferings with fortitude and reſignation, as becoming a race of men endowed with ſuperior ſouls in adverſity.</p>
               <p>We are much indebted to Monſ. Skjoldebrand, and brother, his Swediſh majeſty's agents, in this city, for their humanity, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the American captives; and feel ourſelves particularly obliged to you for recommending us to the good offices of conſuls Skjoldebrand, and Mr. Mace, whom you mention to us as friends.</p>
               <p>With ſentiments of gratitude and the moſt profound reſpect, we remain,</p>

               <p>I HAVE been favoured by the receipt of your joint letter, dated 29th December, and, as I am about to ſet out immediately for Liſbon, I ſhall be able to do little more than aſſure you that your memorials to the Senate and Houſe of Repreſentatives of the United States ſhall be forwarded to them in the earlieſt and ſafeſt manner poſſible.</p>
               <p>Having communicated to Mr. Carmichael, and Mr. Short, your apprehenſion that the plague may again be introduced to Algiers, from the adjacent countries, where it is already ſaid to prevail; we have not heſitated to concur with you in ſentiment, that in caſe of that dreadful event, it might be uſeful for you to have a houſe hired in the country; in order to endeavour, by all human precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to prevent your falling victims to that terrible diſorder. Whereupon Mr. Robert Montgomery, conſul of the United States, at Alicant, has been empowered, in caſe that dreadful event ſhould happen, to furniſh ſufficient money to pay for the hire of a houſe, in the manner, and for the purpoſe you propoſe. This proviſional ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement to continue in force, until Mr. Montgomery ſhall receive ulterior inſtructions from the government of the United States, for continuing or ſuſpending the ſame.</p>
               <p>I entreat you will be perſuaded, my dear and unfortunate coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, that I receive with great ſatiſfaction the marks of your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, of the honeſt, but ineffectual efforts I have made in your favor. Would to Heaven, they had been as ſucceſsful, as they were diſintereſted and ſincere.</p>

Though I have repeatedly remarked, that it may perhaps, (for particular reaſons) be inexpedient for me to keep up a regular correſpondence with you; yet it is proper I ſhould add, that I ſhall always be glad to hear from you; and that it may be particularly intereſting to the government of our country, to receive at the earlieſt poſſible period, all intelligence of importance. I ſhall therefore always be ready to communicate ſuch intelligence, until ſome nearer, and better channel of communication can be eſtabliſhed.</p>

               <head>No. VIII. Treatment of the American Priſoners at Algiers.</head>
               <p>WHILE the people of the United States, anxious to preſerve their liberty at home, they cannot be unconcerned at knowing the hard fate of thoſe of their countrymen, who, by being expoſed to the ſevere and perilous duties of the ſea, are rendered at the ſame time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to, and many of them actually enduring the hard condition of ſlaves, to the moſt ferocious enemies to humanity.</p>
               <p>Captain Laurence, of the Hull Packet, was deſirous of obtaining the beſt and moſt authentic information, reſpecting the condition of his unfortunate countrymen in Algiers, obtained it at Cadiz, and now reſpectfully lays it before the American people.— The Americans taken by the Algerines, have their heads cloſe ſhaved; nor are they allowed to wear any kind of covering on the head: they are entirely ſtript of their apparel, and a coarſe dreſs given inſtead of it. At night they are confined in a dungeon, and at day-light led in chains to their uſual work, which is generally rigging and fitting ſhips; ſome are ſent as navigators and pilots on board the cruizers, and are obliged, on pain of puniſhment, to exert themſelves to the utmoſt of their abilities.</p>
               <p>Their food is generally bread and water, nor is the leaſt difference made between ſick and well, officers and men, but all treated equally ill. It was reported at Cadiz, that there were ſeveral European na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigators lately gone among them; particularly one Kelly, who was tried in Dublin for piracy; and that they were determined to ſcour the weſtern ocean next ſpring. The Hull Packet left Cadiz with an Engliſh fleet, under convoy of a frigate and ſloop of war. A few days after leaving that place, two ſail paſſed the fleet, ſteering in for the Streights, the ſloop of war gave chace and ſpoke them; and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Laurence was informed they were an Algerine cruizer, and an American ſhip, her prize.</p>

            <p>AMERICAN MUSEUM. From its commencement in January, 1787, to its termination in December, 1792. Twelve volumes, 8vo. Price nineteen dollars and one fifth.</p>
            <p>"The American Muſeum is not only eminently calculated to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeminate political, agricultural, philoſophical, and other valuable information—but it has been uniformly conducted with taſte, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and propriety. If to theſe important objects be ſuperadded the more immediate deſign, of reſcuing public documents from oblivion, I will venture to pronounce, as my ſentiment, that a more uſeful literary plan has never been undertaken in America, nor one more deſerving of public encouragement."

            <p>YOUNG MISSES' MAGAZINE. Containing—Dialogues between a governeſs and ſeveral young ladies of quality, her ſcholars;—in which each lady is made to ſpeak according to her particular genius, temper, and inclination.—Their ſeveral faults are pointed out, and the eaſy way to amend them, as well as to think, and ſpeak, and act properly; no leſs care being taken to form their hearts to goodneſs, than to enlighten their underſtanding with uſeful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. A ſhort and clear abridgment is alſo given of ſacred and profane hiſtory, and ſome leſſons in geography. The uſeful is blended throughout with the agreeable; the whole being inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed with proper reflections and moral tales. Price one dollar, thirty-three cents.</p>
            <p>CHARLOTTE—A TALE OF TRUTH. A novel—by Mrs. Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the New-Theatre, Philadelphia—author of Victoria, the Inquiſitor, Fille de Chambre, &amp;c. Price 62½cents.</p>
            <p>"IT may be a Tale of Truth, for it is not unnatural, and it is a tale of real diſtreſs—Charlotte, by the artifice of a teacher, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to a ſchool, from humanity rather than a conviction of her integrity, or the regularity of her former conduct, is enticed from her governeſs, and accompanies a young officer to America.—The marriage ceremony, if not forgotten, is poſtponed, and Charlotte dies a martyr to the inconſtancy of her lover, and treachery of his friend. The ſituations are artleſs and affecting—the deſcription natural and pathetic; we ſhould feel for Charlotte if ſuch a perſon ever exiſted, who for one error, ſcarcely, perhaps, deſerved ſo ſevere a puniſhment. If it is a fiction; poetic juſtice is not, we think, properly diſtributed." Critical Review, vol. i. p. 468.</p>
