         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Believe it can't be unknown to you, That ſome time the laſt Summer, I preſented a <hi>Memorial</hi> to His Excellency the <hi>Governour</hi> and <hi>Council,</hi> referring to the <hi>Bank of Credit,</hi> Projected by a Number of Gentlemen, Merchants, and others among us; and you muſt needs have ſeen in the Publick <hi>News-Paper,</hi> an Order of <hi>Council</hi> that was paſſed upon that Occaſion; whereby the Projectors were directed to <hi>Proceed no further in that Affair, until the next Seſſion of the General Aſſembly,</hi> That ſo the whole Government might be of Advice in a Matter of that Weight and Conſequence. Notwithſtanding all which, (I am loth to ſay in Contempt of it) the Perſons Concerned, are openly carrying on their <hi>Bank</hi> with utmoſt Vigour and Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as Suppoſing, and indeed Affirming, That the Government have nothing to do with them in that Affair: So that 'tis very much to be queſtioned, whether the Projectors
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001675_0003_0fb4e0f61a27f410"/>
will make any Application to the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> or not; looking upon themſelves very Well and Sufficient without it. But does it follow, <hi>SIR,</hi> That the Government muſt ſit ſtill, and neither <hi>Say</hi> nor <hi>Do</hi> any thing, when they ſee and hear of a Projection that is juſt ripe for Execution, which ſo very much Imports the Prerogative of the <hi>Crown,</hi> the Conſtitution and Laws of this Province, the Eſtates and Liberties of the People, and that not only for the preſent, but ſucceeding Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations? No, it can't be!</p>
            <p>I doubt not, but that before I have finiſhed this Letter, to prove beyond all Queſtion, and that by very good Reaſon, That as it Principally, and in the firſt Place behoves the <hi>Government,</hi> and <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, ſo it really Concerns every Man that has any Intereſt in this Country, with great Application to Enquire into, and ſeriouſly Conſider the Nature and Conſequences of this <hi>Bank</hi> of <hi>Partnerſhip,</hi> and that before it take Effect, and there be no Remedy: For do but ſuppoſe, <hi>SIR,</hi> This <hi>Pandora's Box</hi> once opened, and Two Hundred Thouſand Pounds of theſe <hi>Bank-Bills</hi> Iſſued and Circulating upon <hi>Loan,</hi> or otherwiſe, and the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at home ſhould afterwards, in their Great Wiſdom Diſapprove and Suppreſs 'em, or it ſhould otherwiſe Miſcarry and come to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001675_0004_0fb4e0f8a9403228"/>
nothing, by any unforeſeen Accident; into what irreparable Miſchiefs, Confuſion and Miſery would every body be Involved, that had to do with 'em? and the Blame and Reproach of it finally (with too much Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) be thrown and Center on the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi>: For it will be Natural for every one then to ſay, <hi>Ay' Why did not the Government Interpoſe and Prevent this?</hi> And it was this very Conſideration that principally Determined me at this time, freely to Communicate my Thoughts upon this Matter: And I could not, I am ſure, think of a more ſuitable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to Offer 'em to, than One, who has deſervedly ſo good a Character and great an Influence in his Country.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed any further, I muſt pray you not to miſtake my Deſign; for my Intention is not ſo much to ſit in Judgment upon this <hi>Bank Projection,</hi> as to Awaken the Government, (Pardon the Expreſſion) and to Convince the Projectors, that not one Step in an Affair of this Conſequence, ought to be taken without the Knowledge and Leave of His Majeſty's Government of this Province, and that for theſe two Reaſons: Principally,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> Becauſe we are a Dependent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and muſt in all things Conform our ſelves to the Laws of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the Inſtructions of the <hi>Crown</hi>; and therefore
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001675_0005_0fb4e0fce29f1538"/>
muſt expect to give an Account of all our Matters. And then,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> Becauſe the People of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try have their next and immediate Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> who are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to ſee to it, (as they will anſwer the Truſt repoſed in them) that the <hi>Common-Wealth</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive no Damage by their Means. But to proceed in what I have further to ſay, I ſhall take this Method. Firſt I ſhall give you a ſhort Abſtract of the Projection it ſelf, and then ſome of my Sentiments or Reflections upon it.</p>
            <p>The Projection in ſhort, as I underſtand it is thus: <hi>A, B, C, D, &amp;c,</hi> to the Number we'll ſay of one Hundred, by a certain Policy of their own Framing, Aggregate or Join themſelves together into a <hi>Company</hi> or <hi>Partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> in Order to make a <hi>Bank of Credit,</hi> as they call it, by Subſcriptions, amounting to Two Hundred Thouſand Pounds; which Sum they propoſe to make into <hi>Bills,</hi> of <hi>Pounds,</hi> and <hi>Shillings,</hi> and to let 'em out at Four Pounds <hi>per Cent.</hi> Intereſt; the Subſcribers themſelves being obliged to take out one quarter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of their reſpective Subſcriptions, and give good Security accordingly; the other three Quarters to be let out upon good Land Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to ſuch as will borrow 'em; the Profits ariſing from time to time, upon the Loan of

the <hi>Bills,</hi> to be to the Community or <hi>Partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> excepting ſome Proportions thereof, which they propoſe for the Uſe of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the Town of <hi>Boſton,</hi> and ſome other Publick Uſes, after the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Certainly, Men that Talk at this Rate, muſt be abſolute Strangers to the Conſtitution and Laws of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> the Honour of Government, the very Notion and Nature of Corporations: For any one that has but lookt into the Hiſtory of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> will find that the ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, Fraternities, and Corporations there, have been all of them Created, either by <hi>Charter</hi> from the <hi>Crown,</hi> or by Act of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and ſome of 'em by both; and neither have, nor pretend to any other Powers, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes or Liberties, than ſuch as are Given and Limited to 'em in and by their ſeveral

               <hi>Charters.</hi> And indeed it is altogether as Abſurd in the Law, for a <hi>Body Politick</hi> to Create it ſelf, as in Philoſophy for the <hi>Body Natural.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Law-Books</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> do all <hi>Una Voce</hi> Proclaim it as an undoubted Truth, That all <hi>Powers Politick,</hi> all <hi>Franchiſes, Liberties, Charters Corporations,</hi> and the like, are Derived from the King, as their Original Fountain. And I believe this is the firſt time that ever any thing to the Contrary entred into the Reaſon of any Man out of <hi>Eutopia.</hi> I am ſure the Great and Famous <hi>Bank of England</hi> was firſt Found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and is ſtill Supported on the ſtrength of an Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and a <hi>Charter</hi> of the late King <hi>William</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> of Glorious Memory; as may be ſeen at Large by the ſaid Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> made in the Fifth and Sixth Years of that Reign: Whereby Their Majeſties were Impower'd to Incorporate a Number of Gentlemen, Merchants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by the Name of the <hi>Governour and Company of the Bank of England</hi>; who were to Govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by certain Rules and Limitations, made partly by the ſaid Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> and to be made by Their Majeſties in the <hi>Charter,</hi> and which was finally Subject to the Condition of a Redemption by <hi>Parliament.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:001675_0009_0fb4e10684087880"/>But our Gentlemen, it ſeems, have found out a nearer way to a <hi>Bank</hi> and <hi>Corporation,</hi> than the Tedious and Troubleſome one of a <hi>Charter</hi> from Home, or Acts of <hi>Aſſembly</hi> here; and not only preſume to Incorporate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and make their own Rules and Orders, but alſo very Dutifully forecloſe and ſhut out the Government from any Power of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or indeed any other Concern with 'em.</p>
            <p>Poſſibly theſe Gentlemen may ſay, They don't pretend to Incorporate or make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a <hi>Body Politick, &amp;c.</hi> but to Obviate that Objection, I ſhall give you the Notion, and Nature of a Corporation, as I find it in my Lord <hi>Cook's</hi> Inſtitutes, and then leave you to Judge how Inconſiſtent this Objection is with their Policy or Projection.</p>
            <p>My Lord <hi>Cook</hi> ſays, <q>A Corporation is a Body to take in Succeſſion, Framed as to that Capacity by the Policy of Man, and called a Corporation, becauſe the Perſons are made into a Body, and ſo are of Capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to Take or Grant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with Powers to Sue or be Sued, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:001675_0010_0fb4e1089b1d4ca8"/>As to their <hi>Bank-Bills,</hi> I readily grant they are not Money; for indeed nothing can be Money properly, and in the Law of <hi>England,</hi> but <hi>Silver</hi> or <hi>Gold</hi> (both which are of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinſick and Univerſal Value) that has the Impreſs of the Prince, and made Current at a Rate, or Value ſet by Act of <hi>Parliament,</hi> or Proclamation of the <hi>Crown.</hi> However, theſe <hi>Bills</hi> will have as much the Face and Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Money, as even the <hi>Bills</hi> of the <hi>Bank of England,</hi> or the <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. For they are to be <hi>Printed,</hi> to be <hi>Stamped</hi> with an <hi>Eſcutcheon,</hi> to be <hi>Mark'd</hi> with <hi>Pounds</hi> and <hi>Shillings</hi>: They are to be Let out at Intereſt, and finally, the Projectors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves tell us, They are to ſerve as a <hi>Medium</hi> of Exchange, which was the Firſt Riſe, and ſtill continues the End and Uſe of Money. But that which I Inſiſt on under this Head as before, is, That no Perſon, or Number of Perſons whatſoever,, can Aſſume, or may Dare to take this Power to themſelves, but muſt Derive it from the <hi>Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But beſides what I have ſaid of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, the Nature of <hi>Corporations</hi> in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, with <hi>Political Powers, Liberties, &amp;c.</hi> and in Particular of the <hi>Bank of England,</hi> I muſt needs obſerve to you, an Act of <hi>Parliament</hi> made in the Sixth Year of the Reign of our
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001675_0011_0fb4e109858a1358"/>
late Sovereign Lady Queen <hi>Anne</hi> of Bleſſed Memory, wherein it is Enacted, <hi>That during the Continuance of the</hi> Bank of England, <hi>it ſhall not be Lawful for any Body Politick or Corporate, other than the ſaid Company of the</hi> Bank, <hi>or for other Partners exceeding Six in</hi> England, <hi>to Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or Owe any Sum on Bill or Note Payable on Demand, or at any time leſs than Six Months from Borrowing thereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I ſhan't trouble you or my ſelf, to Argue how far this Projection would be a Breach upon the Conſtitution of the <hi>Bank of England</hi>; yet I think it is very fair and eaſy to obſerve, that ſo great a Number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as our Projectors conſiſt of, may by no Means, without a ſufficient Power firſt had, preſume to Make or Iſſue theſe their Joynt <hi>Bills</hi> or <hi>Notes.</hi> For certainly, if the ſame Fact committed in <hi>England,</hi> by a Number exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Six, would be a breach of Law, much more may we ſuppoſe it forbidden and made Unlawful for an Hundred to do it here.</p>
            <p>We frequently meet in our <hi>Law-Books,</hi> with Informations in the Nature of <hi>Quo Warrantos</hi> againſt Corporations, and Bodies Politick, for Uſurping Powers, Franchiſes and Liberties not belonging to them; or for abuſing and acting contrary to thoſe that do. And the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001675_0012_0fb4e10ba5c2c368"/>
Defence generally made in thoſe Caſes, has been Founded on their ſeveral <hi>Charters.</hi> But now ſuppoſe ſuch an Information were Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be brought againſt theſe Projectors, what Defence in the Law could poſſibly be made by them, or for them?</p>
            <p>I now proceed to the next General Head which I propoſed, and that is, How far the Government, and the very Conſtitution of this Province may be affected by, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought thoroly to Inform themſelves about this Projection: And I think nothing can be plainer, than that the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> of the Province, are under a neceſſity of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into the Legality, the Juſtice, the Safety, and Publick Advantage of this <hi>Bank,</hi> and if judged otherwiſe; by ſome proper Act, or Publick Order to Declare againſt, and forbid it, until His Majeſties Pleaſure may be known upon it. And as no wiſe Man, or good Subject can queſtion the Power or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Government in ſo doing, ſo 'tis much to be feared on the other Hand, in Caſe they ſhould be wholly Silent, they might be called in Queſtion at Home, for any ill Conſequences of their Neglect therein: For I can't agree by any means with thoſe Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen that Argue, Becauſe the <hi>Bank</hi> is Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, and the Government as ſuch not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001675_0013_0fb4e10c8c27f040"/>
Intereſted in it, that the whole Blame and Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage will fall on the Projectors. Can it be Imagined, that when this Affair has been ſo Publick, the Government Notified of it ſo Effectually, and the Projection it ſelf of ſo high and extraordinary a Nature, That upon the whole, no Account will be demanded by His Majeſty of the Government, what Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods they took upon this Occaſion, to ſecure the Honour of the Crown, and the Safety of the Subject. But be that as it will, I think it very Unreaſonable, and abſolutely Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the Honour, the Power, and Wiſdom of this Government, to ſuffer any Projection whatſoever, tho' otherwiſe never ſo well Framed, to be ſet up and carried on, and they have no Advice about it, no Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over it, nor ſo much as a Power to Redeem it, in caſe they ſee good. This will be in effect, to ſuffer a Number of their own People to ſet up an abſolute Independent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which like a Fire in the Bowels, will Burn up and Conſume the whole Body. If ſuch things as theſe may be Tolerated, 'twill be a vain thing any longer to talk of Government, a Power of making Laws, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulating Trade, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For they that can make at one Daſh, the Sum beforementioned, and as much more when they pleaſe, will quickly Govern the Trading part, and by degrees
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001675_0014_0fb4e1137925e5e8"/>
get the Land, of the Country Mortgaged to them, and ſo at length bear down the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment it ſelf, <hi>and nothing be reſtrained from them.</hi> For which Reaſon I hope, and doubt not, but that the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, will upon this great Occaſion, exert their proper Powers, as they have once and again heretofore, when they have been under any apprehenſions of Danger, either to the Government, or the Publick Good. Two notable Inſtances whereof you'll find in the <hi>Memorial,</hi> one with reſpect to the making of Money, and the other of a Partnerſhip or Company, both which are Publiſhed among the Printed Acts.</p>
            <p>As to the Act of Parliament of the Sixth of the late Queen beforementioned, the Act of Parliament of late alſo made referring to Money in the Plantations, the ſeveral Laws of our own Province, with reſpect to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and the Intereſt of it; as alſo thoſe that concern the <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> Eſtabliſhed on the Province; all of which will more or leſs be Affected, Invalidated, and broke in upon by this Projection. I have taken ſo much No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them in the <hi>Memorial,</hi> that I ſhall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear ſaying any thing more on that Head here, ſave only to Remark, That as the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Court</hi> or <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of the Province, ſo
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001675_0015_0fb4e114e533c208"/>
certainly no particular Number of Perſons in a Company or Partnerſhip, can Pretend, or muſt Preſume to Inſtitute or Eſtabliſh any thing Repugnant to the Laws of <hi>England.</hi> And ſo I paſs on, in the laſt Place to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Frame and Nature of this <hi>Laudable Projection,</hi> as ſome are pleaſed to call it; and my Objections to it are ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> Its abſolute Independency on the Government, either as to its Regulation, or the power of Redemption; which, as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before, is a thing Intolerable, and without Precedent, and never ſo much as entred into the Minds of the Projectors of the Great <hi>Bank of England</hi> to Ask, much leſs of the Government to Grant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> I cannot ſee the Reaſonableneſs and Juſtice of it, betwixt the Subſcribers and Borrowers: For, as I have Remarked already, the Subſcribers are obliged to take out but a Quarter part of their Subſcriptions, the other three Quarters is to be Let out at four <hi>per Cent.</hi> Intereſt, upon good Security. Now, according to the common courſe of Intereſt, in leſs than Twenty Years, and if the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſhall pleaſe, by iſſuing out a greater Quantity of <hi>Bills,</hi> in a third part of that Time, the Subſcribers will have cleared their
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001675_0016_0fb4e1164c1f0ed0"/>
own Mortgages, draw out their own Stakes, and ſo have the Intereſt of the whole to ſhare among themſelves, and the <hi>Bubbled Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers</hi> pay Intereſt for their own Eſtates. Pray where's the Juſtice of this? Why ſhould not the Borrowers when it comes to that, have ſome of the Profits of the <hi>Bank,</hi> when their Eſtates are the only remaining Fund? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, it may ſeem a very eaſy and ſhort Way of getting an Eſtate; but ſure no Projection can expect to Succeed, that is not Founded in Commutative Juſtice and Common Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty.</p>
            <p>I ſhould be glad to know of theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that pretend to be ſo Publick Spirited in this Buſineſs, whether they could be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and have the fame Opinion of this <hi>Bank,</hi> if their Names were taken out of the Policy, and an equal Number of others put in, and I ſuppoſe, without any Reflection, as Good may be found, and ſo inſtead of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lenders, they would become Borrowers of theſe <hi>Bank-Bills?</hi> I am afraid not! For the Buſineſs is, and very good Buſineſs it would be, in one Day to be Maſters of 150000 <hi>l.</hi> and without any Riſque at all, or any other Charge or Trouble, except the Printing and Signing a few pieces of Paper, to accept of Six Thouſand Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> Intereſt: By
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001675_0017_0fb4e11b86c6f088"/>
which Method, in effect, the Projectors would immediately have the Profits of other Mens Eſtates; and finally, as the Matter may be managed, the Eſtates themſelves, without a valuable Conſideration; their <hi>Bank-Bills</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but pieces of Paper that have no other Value, but what the Borrowers give them. And yet we are made to believe, that the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers are well dealt with, if tho' they pay Intereſt, yet they may at laſt have their own Eſtates or Pawns back again, upon bringing in the Bills. If this be not the <hi>Philoſopher's Stone,</hi> there is no ſuch thing in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> It muſt, I think, unavoidably prove a great Snare and Miſchief to People that want Money to pay their Debts or otherwiſe, for whoſe Eaſe and Advantage nevertheleſs the <hi>Bank</hi> is Projected: As for Example; A Man owes me one Hundred Pounds upon Bond, in the <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> of the Province, and very readily pays me Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> Intereſt; to Diſcharge which, he repairs to the <hi>Bank,</hi> and Borrows 100 <hi>l.</hi> in their <hi>Bills,</hi> and comes to take up his Bond: Can any Man in Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or Juſtice think, that I ſhall take one Hundred Pounds in <hi>Bank-Bills,</hi> that will fetch but Four <hi>per Cent.</hi> for one Hundred Pounds in <hi>Province-Bills,</hi> that People ſo willingly give Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> for? No ſure. I muſt at leaſt
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001675_0018_0fb4e11dfad81a28"/>
have as many of the <hi>Bank-Bills,</hi> as will fetch Six <hi>per Cent.</hi> And if the <hi>Bankers</hi> ſhould out of their great Generoſity, and in Compaſſion as they pretend to ſuch as want Money, Let their Intereſt at three, or two <hi>per Cent.</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, the Caſe would be ſo much the worſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> What Security will the laſt Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor of theſe <hi>Bills</hi> have to depend upon, in caſe this <hi>Bank</hi> ſhould be broke up, either by the Government, or its ſelf? As for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: A Man has one Thouſand Pounds of 'em by him; what ſhall he do with 'em, when the Credit of 'em is come to nothing? For, by the Tenour of the <hi>Bills,</hi> as you ſee, they are only obliged to accept of 'em for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Pawns or Mortgages; and this Poſſeſſor has neither to take up. Poſſibly you'll ſay the <hi>Bankers</hi> will Aſſign him over a Mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage: To that I anſwer, That the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being gone, every thing elſe will fall with it. I doubt our Courts would never Adjudge thoſe Mortgages to be good in the Law, being for no Valuable Conſideration, ſo that the Lands ſo Mortgaged, would Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to the Original Owners, like the Year of <hi>Jubilee</hi> among the <hi>Jews.</hi> And then as to the Poſſeſſors Suing of the Company to make good their <hi>Bills,</hi> firſt there will be no ſuch thing in caſe they be Diſſolved by Order of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001675_0019_0fb4e1229d6c5558"/>
Government; ſecondly, If in the other Caſe, it ſhould ſink of it felf, they may prove Inſolvent, and ſo the Poſſeſſor be finely <hi>Lurched</hi>: For which Reaſon, all Wiſe Men will be afraid to meddle with them, or be ſure to get rid of them as faſt as they can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly.</hi> The Name and Stile of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, is a <hi>Bank of Credit</hi>: Now I take it for a certain Rule, That no <hi>Money-Bank,</hi> as we may call it, can or will poſſibly have any <hi>Credit</hi> that is not Equal, either Really, or in Reputation, to the True or common Current Money of the Country, or Place where ſuch <hi>Bank</hi> is Erected: And You may depend upon it, <hi>SIR,</hi> That if the <hi>Bills</hi> of the <hi>Bank of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> it ſelf were not looked upon as good as <hi>Specie,</hi> and in effect a <hi>Money-Bank,</hi> the Credit of 'em would quickly come to nothing. For which Purpoſe there are always kept in the Office of the ſaid <hi>Bank</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> vaſt Sums of <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Gold,</hi> to Exchange for their <hi>Bills</hi> to any one that demands it. Beſides which, the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> as you may ſee fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently by the <hi>London-Gazett,</hi> is always ready for that End to Aſſiſt 'em with whatever Sums they may have Occaſion for. But now our Projectors don't ſo much as pretend to have the leaſt Doight of <hi>Silver</hi> or <hi>Gold,</hi> or even a Stock of <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> of this Province
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001675_0020_0fb4e1264ecc9ad0"/>
to Anſwer, in Caſe of Neceſſity, or to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Credit of their <hi>Bills</hi> withal. And I am ſure they have no reaſon to expect the Aſſiſtance of the Government upon any Emergency, ſince as yet, they have not ſo much as Conſulted them in the whole Affair.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly.</hi> I cannot but think, the Making and Iſſuing ſo great a Quantity of theſe <hi>Bank-Bills,</hi> will be attended with a great deal of Miſchief and Confuſion as to Money in General: Now Money is of the greateſt Importance, and laſt Conſequence to a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth</hi>; for as 'tis the Sinews of <hi>War,</hi> ſo 'tis the Strength of <hi>Peace</hi>: For which Reaſon, we can't have too much of that which really is Money, but we may very eaſily have too much of that which is not ſo.</p>
            <p>The pooreſt Country-Man in the Province, is not convinced to this Day, but that <hi>Silver,</hi> tho' never ſo Rough and Unpoliſhed, is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to the fineſt <hi>Paper-Money</hi> that ever was ſeen. We have had too much Confuſion already in the Province, by the Difference that has been made between <hi>Silver-Money</hi> and our Publick <hi>Bills of Credit,</hi> (when yet they were Supported by the Government) and are hardly got over it to this Day. But into what
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001675_0021_0fb4e127817faac0"/>
a Gulph of Miſery by <hi>Stock-jobbing</hi> Difference of Money, and innumerable other Miſchiefs ſhall we be plunged think you, when ſuch a Flood of Private <hi>Paper-Money</hi> comes to be poured out among us? 'Tis now more than Twelve Years ſince the Government firſt began to Make and Iſſue the <hi>Bills of Credit</hi>; and tho' the Occaſions and Neceſſities of the Province have been very Preſſing and Urgent, yet in all that time, they have made but about Two Hundred and Forty Thouſand Pounds: But as if that were a ſmall Thing, our Gentlemen propoſe at once to Make and Iſſue out 200000 <hi>l.</hi> And by the ſame Reaſon that a <hi>Bank</hi> is ſet up in <hi>Boſton,</hi> ſeveral others may go on in the ſeveral parts of the Province; and what can the Conſequence of this be, but to Confound the People, and make Money Vile and Contemptible; and as much as in them lies, to Alter and Deſtroy the very Nature of Money? So that inſtead of Anſwering all things, as it has always done, and ought to do, it will now Anſwer nothing, and be worſe than every thing elſe; For that which really makes the Value of Money, among other things, is its Rarity: So that upon the whole, the Remedy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by theſe Projectors, will be much worſe than the Diſeaſe. As to the Buſineſs of Trade, for the Eaſe, Benefit, and Advantage whereof
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001675_0022_0fb4e1290d20d318"/>
this Wonderful <hi>Bank</hi> is Projected, it would be well Conſidered, Firſt, Whether we have not generally run upon too much Trade for our Profit, already? For if I am not miſtaken, tho' I am no Merchant, the greatneſs of the Credit given in Trade, has in a great Meaſure, brought this want of Money upon us.</p>
            <p>I confeſs, as to the Encouraging the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of our own Country, and our own Manufactures, the Exporting of our own Commodities we cannot well exceed; but if we Import from Abroad, more than we can Pay for, by what we Produce our ſelves, or Purchaſe from others with our own Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, we ſhall unavoidably grow Poor, and a Million of <hi>Paper-Money</hi> won't help the matter at all: So that the leſs we Import from Abroad, the leſs Money or Medium of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, the Trading part will want. And here indeed has been our great Improvidence and Unhappineſs in this Country, (of late Years eſpecially) that the greateſt part of our Conſumption in <hi>Boſton,</hi> and other Sea-port Towns, almoſt to Food and Raiment, has been of Foreign Commodities, when the ſame things might be raiſed among our ſelves, were the Produce of our own Country Encouraged, at leaſt, ſo much as to make a Ballance of Trade in our Favour. Beſides all which, I
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001675_0023_0fb4e13002c6ad98"/>
cannot but think it the Duty and Intereſt of our Merchants and Traders, who have been the great Occaſion of the Loſs of our <hi>Silver,</hi> to Project ſome way of Recovering it again, and manage the Trade, ſo as that a good Proportion of <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> might once more find the way into <hi>New-England,</hi> and there remain for the Honour and Service of the Government and Country, who have Suffered and been Expoſed too much already for want of it; and had not the abſolute Neceſſity of the Government and People Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired it, it had been better (in the Opinion of many Wiſe Men) for the Province, they had never made any <hi>Bills,</hi> or <hi>Paper-Money</hi> at all.</p>
            <p>I might alſo mention the great Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance that People, and eſpecially the Ordinary ſort, are fallen into, far beyond their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, in their Purchaſes, Buildings, Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, Expences, Apparel, and generally in their whole way of Living: And above all, the exceſſive Conſumption of <hi>Rhum</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> as one of the greateſt Sources and Cauſes of the preſent Diſtreſs: Hereupon it muſt be granted by every one of common Senſe and Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, That if the Importation of Foreign Commodities were leſs, and eſpecially thoſe
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001675_0024_0fb4e131467b7c20"/>
two Branches beforementioned, <hi>viz. Rhum</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> Reduced to what only might be Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Were but a tolerable Proportion of <hi>Silver</hi> brought in to us, which might be effected with Eaſe and Profit, were Frugality and good Husbandry Univerſally in Faſhion among us, there would not be ſuch a Clamour for want of a <hi>Medium</hi> of Exchange. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, as things are at preſent Managed and Circumſtanced among us, both <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Paper-Money</hi> is become very ſcarce; tho' really more in <hi>Boſton,</hi> and among the Trading part, than in Proportion, in the other parts of the Province. And the laſt Seſſion of the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> when I had the Honour to be one of an Extraordinary <hi>Committee</hi> raiſed for that Purpoſe; I gave it as my Opinion, <hi>That con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Demand of the Government as to the Taxes, and the great Occaſions of the People as to their Trade, it might be convenient to Make and Iſſue out a further Quanty of the Publick</hi> Bills of Credit, <hi>&amp;c. in ſuch a Method as was then agreed on</hi>: And of the ſame Opinion were all of that <hi>Committee,</hi> ſave Two, as I Remember, and they conſiſted of Thirteen: And accordingly a Report was made by the <hi>Chair-Man,</hi> in the Name of the reſt. But how that Matter dropt when it came into the <hi>Lower Houſe,</hi> I ſhall not take upon me here to ſay, tho' it may eaſily be gueſſed at. However, I perſwade my
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:001675_0025_0fb4e133304f7e20"/>
ſelf, that when the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> comes to Review that <hi>Report,</hi> the Scheme then Agreed, will be found the beſt, if not the only Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to Relieve the preſent Diſtreſs; and the Gentlemen that Oppoſe it, will I'm Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, have no Thanks from thoſe they Repreſent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>SIR,</hi> I do not pretend in all, or any thing that I have ſaid, to be againſt a <hi>Bank of Credit</hi> in General, were it well Founded, well Limited, and Regulated by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and Equal to our own <hi>Current-Money,</hi> as ſuch a <hi>Bank</hi> ought to be: But I am utterly againſt this preſent Projection, for the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons I have given, and many others that might be Mentioned: And ſince, as I ſaid before, and I really am of that Opinion, That there is a Neceſſity of Supplying the People with a further convenient Quantity of <hi>Bills of Credit,</hi> for the better Payment of their <hi>Taxes,</hi> and the eaſe of Trade. I am abſolutely for its being done by the Publick, and for ſuch Reaſons as theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> We have, had Twelve Years Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence already of the <hi>Publick Bills,</hi> with great Honour, Safety, and Succeſs; Whereas the Private Projection, is a Path that has never yet been Trod, and what the Conſequences may be, we don't know.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:001675_0026_0fb4e1350ba67ba0"/>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> The <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, are Equal even to Seventeen Penny half-penny Weight, as to the Publick Tax, and by a late Act of the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> they are made a good Tender in the Law, as to all Debts Contracted in the Common Courſe of Trade, and by that means upon the Matter, made of an Intrinſick Value, and ſo the Credit of 'em Firm and Neceſſary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> The Profits in Caſe the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Iſſue the <hi>Bills,</hi> will always Redound to the Publick, and ſo every one will have a Benefit thereby. And again, we may reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſuppoſe, that the Government would be more Sparing and Cautious, and not ſo Laviſh in Launching out their <hi>Bills,</hi> as a Private <hi>Bank</hi> would be, not being under the like Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: By which means the Credit of the <hi>Bills</hi> would be the better preſerved. Beſides which, the Province has once and again made good Counterfeits, and further provided againſt 'em, as you may ſee by a Private Act made in the Third Year of the late Reign, and a Publick Act made the very laſt Seſſion of the <hi>Aſſembly</hi>: Whereas there is no Proviſion at all againſt Counterfeits in this Private Projection. And to mention no more upon this Head, the Fund of the Publick <hi>Bills of Credit,</hi> being the Province in General, according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Courſe of Things, can never be doubted, or in Danger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:001675_0027_0fb4e1390baf41b8"/>I know very well what the <hi>Bankers</hi> Object to all this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> That as by the Conſtitution, it is in the Power of the <hi>Governour</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> to draw out the Publick Money, ſo it would be much more in His Power to lay His Hand on the Money ſo made and Let out, it being not raiſed for His Majeſties Uſe, and Appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and thereby Endanger the Liberties of the People. To this I Anſwer, Firſt, That according to the Scheme agreed on, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the <hi>Committee,</hi> The Principal and Profits of that Money were ſo Settled and Secured, that nothing leſs than the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> could Diſpoſe of either. Secondly. As the Projectors have Ordered their <hi>Bank,</hi> 2000 <hi>l.</hi> of their Yearly Profits they deſign to preſent to the Government: Now what they mean by that, is uncertain. Firſt, If they mean a Governour that they ſhall pleaſe to like, I'm ſure it would be a very effectual way to Enſlave this Country, by an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding between ſuch Governour and the <hi>Bank.</hi> Secondly. If they intend the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> then I ſay as in the <hi>Memorial,</hi> That this Government neither can nor ought to be Maintained in any other Method, than by the <hi>Charter,</hi> and Inſtructions from the <hi>Crown.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> That the Government have no Power to do any ſuch thing, as to Make and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:001675_0028_0fb4e13add217d30"/>
Lend out any <hi>Publick Bills</hi>; but with what Deſign they make, and how well they En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force this Objection, I leave the World to Judge, and with their Favour, I ſhould think the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> as Capable of knowing and underſtanding their own Powers, as the Projectors for 'em. I am ſure it was the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the <hi>Committee</hi> beforementioned, That the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> of the Province, were ſufficiently Impowered by the <hi>Charter,</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the neceſſary Support of the Government required it, to Make and Iſſue theſe <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> in the Method then propoſed. And their Opinion was Founded upon that Clauſe in the <hi>Charter,</hi> referring to impoſing reaſonable <hi>Aſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Taxes, &amp;c. In the neceſſary Defence and Support of the Government, and the Protection, and Preſervation of the Inhabitants there,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now Firſt, There's nothing in the <hi>Charter</hi> Repugnant to the Governments Iſſuing a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sum of <hi>Bills.</hi> Secondly, It has been done, once and again, upon great Occaſions, and the Government not blamed for it, that I know of. Thirdly, If the neceſſary Support of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of this Province, and the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the People, (for thoſe are the Words of the <hi>Charter</hi>) require the Making and Iſſuing a further Quantity, then 'tis directly within, and well Warranted by the <hi>Charter.</hi> Now I think we are all agreed in this, That neither
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001675_0029_0fb4e13d99d649d0"/>
the Government nor People (as to their Trade and Buſineſs) can well be Supported and carry on their neceſſary Affairs much longer, without a further Supply of Money, or <hi>Bills of Credit.</hi> Beſides which, the Projectors would do well to tell us, how it comes to paſs, that they ſhould have ſo great a Power of Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the People with Money, and the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly</hi> have none at all. But certainly, if the <hi>Bankers</hi> are ſo wiſe and Cautious as to the Powers of the Government, for fear they ſhould be exceeded, and the Conſtitution thereby Endangered; it much more behoves the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> of the Province, to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe this Caution, with reſpect to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and effectually ſecure the Honour and Safety of the Government, the Eſtates and Liberties of the People, which is the very thing I Contend for, And that which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts me in what I have ſaid and done upon this Occaſion, whatever the Event prove, is, That I have had no Private View, or Sepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Intereſt, much leſs any Prejudice to the Gentlemen concerned; among whom I have many particular Friends; but have Sincerely aim'd at the Publick Good. <hi>SIR,</hi> It was the Excellent Character of the Heads of the Tribe of <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> in <hi>David's</hi> Time, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded for their Honour, and our Imitation, That they were Men of Underſtanding in the

Times, to know what <hi>Iſrael</hi> ought to do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I earneſtly Deſire, and Believe, That the Heads of our Tribes like them, upon this great Occaſion, may and will Diſcern both Time and Judgment; know and ſeek the true Intereſt of their Country: And I ſhall be glad, if I may in any wiſe contribute to ſo good an End, by what I have here Offered. You'll pleaſe to Excuſe the Trouble of this long Letter, and Communicate it as you think Proper.</p>

               <p>SINCE the Date and Delivery of this Letter, I underſtand the <hi>Bankers</hi> have new Modelled their Projection, and Reformed it, as they reckon, in two Articles; But how long this new Scheme will hold, is uncertain, Firſt. Inſtead of Four,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001675_0031_0fb4e141017955a8"/>
they now propoſe to have Five <hi>per Cent.</hi> Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt; but they would do well to tell us by what Law, or with what Juſtice they can pretend to ask or receive one <hi>per Cent.</hi> or indeed any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt at all, for their own <hi>Bills,</hi> which (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is obſerved) are nothing in themſelves, have not the Foundation, the Advantage and Value of the Publick <hi>Bills of Credit</hi> on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, nor ever can without the Government, and muſt be wholly obliged to the Borrowers for their preſent worth or Currency. And I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this is the firſt time that ever Intereſt was asked for any ſort of Money or Bills that had not the Stamp or Authority of a Government.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly.</hi> They have Reformed the Fund alſo, in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging the Subſcribers to give in Real Security, to the Value of 200000 <hi>l.</hi> the full Sum of the Bills propoſed to be made, and ſo not to be obliged to the Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers for any part of the Fund. I confeſs, there ſeems to be ſome Juſtice in this, and ſerves to prove, that there was Reaſon and Weight in my firſt Objection to the Nature and Frame of the <hi>Bank</hi>; And when they have Anſwered the reſt, and made a thorow Reform of their Projection, ſo as it may be Conſiſtent with the Honour and Safety of the Government, the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties and Properties of the People, and agreeable to the Rules of Reaſon, Juſtice and Equity, I believe every one will Encourage and give in to it.</p>
