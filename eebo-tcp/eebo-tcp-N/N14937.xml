            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THE national events that have taken place ſince I ſaw you, lead me to imagine, that you have not wholly forgotten what were my political ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, at the time when I left England. I never was enthuſiaſtic enough to imagine myſelf poſſeſſed of a prophetic ſpirit. However, with reſpect to the iſſue of the American war, if my arrow was caſt at random, you are yet my witneſs, that it has not hit wide of the mark. The idea of my country's ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in had long impreſſed my mind. And this, when I embarked for America, made the farewell peculiarly affectionate. In whatever company or employ I was engaged, the idea of American glory was in view,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018944_0004_0FA90BA33A15E368"/>
until it was painted on my mind, even to a charm. And the moment I ſet my foot on the ſhore, I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced it for my own. And as ſuch, the public in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt has ever ſince had my paſſions at perfect com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; my joy, has ebbed and flowed, with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of the times. Had I been a native of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, I could not have felt a ſtronger attachment to her welfare. Sick of the manners of my country, and European faſhions at large, I thought of nothing in America, but ſimplicity of life, induſtry, oeconomy, and the nobleſt patriotiſm. This I frankly confeſs was the fruit of an overheated imagination: for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience has ſince ſupplied the defect of reaſon, and taught me the miſtake.</p>
               <p>I at firſt landed at Philadelphia, where I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced to ſuch elegance, grandeur, and opulence, as I had no idea of on this ſide the atlantic. But as I have had for many years a growing averſion to the city, and have long ſince been anticipating the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of a rural life; I made no long tarry, but ſoon retired to the interior parts of the country. As I had determined by travelling to acquaint myſelf with the people, of whom I had formed ſuch an idea: I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it a natural dictate of prudence, to accompliſh this in the firſt ſtage of my American exiſtence: that being free from local prejudices, and having gained a more univerſal acquaintance, I might be better able to make a judicious choice with reſpect to a ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In proſecuting this plan my opportunity in the ſtudy of human nature has been conſiderable, and I truſt not wholly unimproved. Be the improvement however what it may, I will riſk this theſis, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of a careful inquiry: that human nature is the ſame, in England and America. At this obſervation
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018944_0005_0FA90BA593AD9518"/>
I doubt not you will ſmile, and ſay the man is recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his inſanity. I readily confeſs my prejudice in favour of America run high, too high, for me to draw an impartial character. I have waited long to feel myſelf cool on the ſubject: but whether long enough, you will better judge from the ſequel of my letters. The people of America are hoſpitable— they are ſociable—they are brave as what I conceived —they are ſenſible and diſcerning to admiration: which has fully convinced me, that popular gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are the moſt friendly to mental improvements. Freedom will raiſe, and bondage will ſink, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the humam mind. And the ſame perſon, in this difference of ſituation, will make a very different figure in the world. Witneſs the black and the white people in this country. The colour has not made the odds; ſhift their ſituations, let the black man be maſter and the white ſervant, and a few gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations would turn the ſcale of ſenſibility.</p>
               <p>The country, as to fertility, and variety of produce, fully anſwers my expectation. And as to extent and ſettlement; it exceeds my imagination warm as it was.</p>
               <p>The laws are generally good; but ſomewhat fail in punctuality of execution. The debt contracted by the war, is not as you imagined any way formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: the reſources of the country, I find abundantly ſufficient to diſcharge it. Nor does the union of the ſtates, or diſpoſition of the people at large, threaten a failure. If there is any deficiency in this reſpect, it is for want of a ſuitable power in Congreſs, to call forth theſe reſources. The people are young and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous —their lands are liberal in the ſupports of life and traffic—in particular they are exceedingly well
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018944_0006_0FA90BA71930BEE8"/>
furniſhed with the materials of ſhip-building, at which the people are ſkilful. This branch of buſineſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords a commodity ſo vendible in Europe, ſo import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant the world over, that if vigorouſly puſhed, would of itſelf in no lengthy period of time, diſcharge the greater part of the debt.</p>
               <p>I was bred like yourſelf in the midſt of great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions, where with but a glance of the eye, might be ſeen the moſt ſtriking contraſt of wealth and pov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty.—In America it is not ſo; there is an equality here, which to an European would be matter of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.—In the country it is uſual for every man to be ſettled on his own plantation, and he is lord of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his deed covers; he knows nothing of the exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant demands either of tyrant, biſhop, or landlord. Notwithſtanding the riſe of taxes, occaſioned by the war, they are yet light compared with yours. They crowd not (as in England) upon the neceſſaries and comforts of life; but leave the induſtrious labourer in full poſſeſſion of both. Back from the ſea coaſt, they are generally farmers; they retire from the field at night, with an appetite created by moderate exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe; this gives a peculiar reliſh to their food and drink, which is plain and wholeſome, but not rich. Being ſtrangers to intemperance, idleneſs and luxury, and with their ſenſes unimpaired by the fare of high life, they appear to take all the ſatisfaction the world affords.</p>
               <p>As I travel, I often from choice take lodging with this claſs of men, and from their table of plain diet, am more pleaſed and refreſhed, than I ſhould be at an entertainment of a lord in England. For here, tho' it be hard to give a reaſon, I participate with them in
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018944_0007_0FA90BA9B3260650"/>
appetite and reliſh.—Here I behold ſimplicity of manners, without mixture of formality, and an honeſt hearted generoſity, without the diſagreeable ſhow of court parade.—Here liberty appears to be more than a ſpeculative ideal thing,—it is a reality. It diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers itſelf in the behaviour and countenance of theſe men; their whole deportment is different from one that has been bred to fawn at a monarch's feet, or one whoſe intereſt wholly depends on keeping his land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord in humour.—I truſt you will not think me fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick in this obſervation: for in your own ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on human nature, you muſt have obſerved the command which the mind has over the features and deportment of the man. Does not the melancholy ſoul wear a wrinkled brow? Does not the thief with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking confeſs his guilt? And why are not the ſlaves of lord and monarch in like manner viſible? From the intimacy and unreſerved freedom I have had in your company, you are ſenſible that I am no enemy to matrimonial connections. The ſituation, circumſtances and manners of my country, are what have ſo long confined me to a celibic life. I never could feel it duty, to be inſtrumental of introducing my own ſpecies to that which was ſo diſagreeable to myſelf. My ſoul has often recoiled at the idea of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing father to one who ſhould be a tenant to a lord, or a vaſſal to a tyrant.—But methinks theſe objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are removed, and I begin to feel the force of duty and inclination without oppoſition. You will therefore not be ſurpriſed, ſhould you ſoon hear of my forming a very ſerious acquaintance with one of theſe farmers daughters. For on all accounts I muſt prefer their education and manner of life, which is for the moſt part neat, frugal and induſtrious.—They
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018944_0008_0FA90BAA0BB6BFB0"/>
are perſons of good humour; nor has their taſte ever been corrupted by the follies and fopperies of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; though at the ſame time they are no ſtrangers to good breeding. I have many motives to this choice in particular. I conſider the diſpoſition in a great meaſure formed by early example; and the different callings that employ mankind, are not without their influence in this reſpect. The trader undergoes that ſhift of fortune and ſhift of paſſion to which the farmer is not expoſed: hence theſe employments are not alike friendly to that calmneſs of diſpoſition, which is a main pillar in the ſupport of conjugal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Let a perſon be brought up in a family, where the domeſtic affairs are conducted in a chole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick manner, and where peviſhneſs in the heads, is frequently ſeen triumphant over reaſon: and it is a wonder if the diſpoſition does not hence receive a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable tincture. And the ſame obſervation may be made with regard to other defects in human life: it is in this way that family vices are propagated, and handed down from parent to child and from child to grandchild, not only to their own reproach, but to the great detriment of civil ſociety. I am therefore governed in this matter, not ſo much with a view to my own happineſs, as the good of a riſing family: where the mother as ſhe more conſtantly preſides, muſt have a principal hand in forming the children either to virtue or vice. The mother of a family I conſider as the open book, from which the child takes the leſſon of life. And of what intereſting concern is it then to theſe tender minds, that the leſſon be good, founded on morality and ſuited to attemper the diſpoſition, both to private happineſs and public uſefulneſs?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:018944_0009_0FA90BAAD69ED520"/>It would not be ſtrange if by this time you begin to wonder at my freedom,—indeed I am ſurpriſed at myſelf, eſpecially on a ſubject of this delicate nature. At firſt I thought only to have ſtarted the idea, but have been led inſenſibly to the above obſervations. However you would readily pardon me, had you been witneſs to that which of late has ſo captivated my mind. I have often with reſpect to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of life, built caſtles in the air: I have often al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed my imagination to rove uncontroled on the ſubject: and as often has my judgment and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence daſhed the airy bubble, and convinced me that the whole was but an ideal thing, not capable in its nature of being reduced to practice.—Here among the farmers of America, I behold the happineſs of life exemplified beyond whatever reaſon or obſervation taught me before.</p>
               <p>For ſome days paſt, I have taken my rout farther back in the country than heretofore, which has led me into a territory as yet but thinly inhabited. Here while I am paſſing plains, intervals and mountains, I meet with nothing to diſturb my reflections. The ſoil I obſerve is exceedingly good, and in every point of view inviting to the huſbandman.—Never did I feel ſuch tenderneſs for the vaſſals of lord and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch as now,—can it be that ſo many millions of the human race ſhould drag out the miſerable remains of life, ignorant that there is any part of the world that will better ſupport them?—can there be ſuch inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity in the great, as to build their grandeur and ſupport their luxury upon the toil of their fellow-mortals, when the wilds of America invite them to liberty, and where a few years induſtry would raiſe them to a ſtate of opulence and independence?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:018944_0010_0FA90BAB82334F08"/>In theſe woods I now and then paſs a log-houſe, around which there are conſiderable improvements, proportioned no doubt to the proprietor's induſtry, and time of ſettlement. I often call and inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their welfare, and queſtion them in the proficiency they make on their new plantations. I came laſt evening to one of theſe habitations, it was earlier in the day than I would have wiſhed to put up; but fearing leſt night might overtake me in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or leſt I might not find an houſe that promiſed ſo good accommodation, I aſked for entertainment, which was readily granted. The family ſeemed pleaſed to have an opportunity of waiting on a ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. My landlord, when he came from the field at night, diſcovered the ſame good humour in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, —he bid me welcome to his houſe, and to his table of plain diet, which was ſoon made ready.— He informed me that it was not more than ſix years ſince the firſt ſtroke was ſtruck on his farm; and he had then between fifty and ſixty acres cleared—kept an handſome ſtock—raiſed his own wool and flax— had always after the firſt year a ſurpluſage of grain— made his own meat, his own dairy and his own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel. —Indeed, the oeconomy in the houſe appeared to reſemble that without. While the father with a little child on his knee was giving me this account, the mother with the daughters were about their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick employment. Each one in the family filled his own place, and contentment and ſatisfaction reigned through the whole. After family prayer, which was religiouſly attended, I retired to my lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with a diſpoſition better ſuited to reflection than ſleep. I fancied myſelf to have fallen upon a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, after which the ſages of antiquity had ſought in vain. And that here in the wilderneſs, I had found
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018944_0011_0FA90BAC43FFAA98"/>
in what the greateſt happineſs of life conſiſted. For here was religion without colour of ſuperſtition—here was civil and religious liberty in perfection—here was independence, as far as the nature of human life would admit—here fulneſs was enjoyed in retirement —and the whole ſhut out from the diſagreeable noiſe and buſtle of the world. After we aroſe in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, my landlord invited me to a walk in the field, where I ſaw the fruits and effects of induſtry united with the beſt oeconomy. And finding him to be a very affable ſenſible man, I aſked him a number of queſtions, among the reſt, whether he could give any account how far thoſe wilds were habitable, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſoil in general was in any meaſure to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the ſpot on which he was ſettled. This queſtion introduced the following narration, which he gave me.—A friend of his with two others a few years before, ſet out with a determination to pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the weſtern wilderneſs, as far as prudence ſhould direct. They travelled fifteen days for the moſt part on a weſterly line, without diſcovering the leaſt trace of any human creature. The wild beaſts would often ſtart before them, of theſe there was a great plenty and a great variety, among which their fire-arms contributed much to their amuſement as well as ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. On the afternoon of the fifteenth day, when they had travelled not leſs than three hundred miles, from any inhabitants, they unexpectedly diſcovered a large plantation under the beſt improvement. In the midſt of this appeared a ſtately elegant building, in Engliſh faſhion. With joy they haſtened to the gate of the high yard, which ſurrounded this ſeat. The porter that ſtood centinel underſtood from ſigns their deſire of admittance—carried their requeſt, and ſoon returned with liberty of admiſſion. They were
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018944_0012_0FA90BADC273CAD8"/>
received into the family, where they had all the marks of hoſpitality ſhewn them; but were not admitted that night to ſpeak with the maſter of the houſe. In the morning they were invited to his apartment, in an upper loft, where, in addition to their joy, they found him to be a man of their own colour, and one who ſpoke their own language. He ſufficiently apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logized for not waiting on them the evening before. The reaſon was, his being employed in preparing a packet for Quebec with reſpect to the fur trade, over which he preſided in that quarter of the world. —The hiſtory of the man in a few words, is this.— When a child he was bound an apprentice to a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in Albany, with whom he lived till he was nineteen years of age; when his maſter's ſeverity growing intolerable, he privately left him, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination to ſeek a retreat in the wilderneſs, beyond the ſearch or information of his maſter. On his route he fell on this ſmall village of the natives, with whom he aſſociated, and with whom after a few years he was connected in marriage. This with other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, procured him the confidence, ſervice and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire obedience of that people, by whoſe labours he brought under improvement, a tract of land which almoſt bounded the eye. He was a man of no educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, could neither read nor write, which proved a very material diſadvantage to his trade. To remedy this defect, he ſent his eldeſt ſon to Quebec, who was there furniſhed with an education ſufficient to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act his father's buſineſs, both among French and Engliſh. His plantation furniſhed his numerous family, with all the neceſſaries of life in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance: nor did his trade contribute leſs to its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences. —That here in this remote part of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, was enjoyed almoſt every thing the world
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018944_0013_0FA90BAE8747AD90"/>
affords, and nothing (as he obſerved) was wanting to compleat the happineſs of his ſituation; but a ſmall circle of friends with whom he might uſe his native language, and ſpend the vacant hours of life.—Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe men had travelled upwards of an hundred miles further, nearly in the ſame direction, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with obſerving, that the whole of this new ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored region, was an exceeding rich ſoil, and by far the moſt level and beautiful of any part of America, that had come within their knowledge.</p>
               <p>At the cloſe of this converſation, I found myſelf poſſeſſed of a ſtrange mixture of feelings.—My pity, gratitude, and joy ran high, ſo as not a little to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb that ſteadineſs of mind, which if poſſible I would diſcover under all occurrences of life. I could not do leſs than croſs the atlantic in imagination, and drop a tear of pity on thoſe I had left behind. Many of which were ignorant that there was any ſuch open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as this on the globe; or if known have yet been ſo long confined in ſlavery as to feel no inclination or reſolution to ſhake off the chain and make the noble adventure.—I could not but have a grateful ſenſe of the divine goodneſs, in preparing ſuch a ſpacious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat for the poor and oppreſſed of mankind, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of it in an age of the world, when it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver more needed. I could not likewiſe but feel a joy at the riſing glory of America. What a foundation is here for a great, laſting and happy empire. In no part of the world was there ever a greater number of natural circumſtances, which united to promiſe the event; and perhaps in no part ſo many of a moral kind. Here is no want of territory—nor is there want of matter on which to ground the beſt civil poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. The hiſtory of the world is before them—the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018944_0014_0FA90BAF52B68700"/>
public virtues and vices of every nation are laid open to their view—their riſe and fall, with the operating cauſes are carefully noticed, eſpecially thoſe of their mother country now on the decline, muſt be freſh in mind, and I truſt will ever prove a leſſon of the moſt ſalutary inſtruction. Theſe among many, are ſome of the natural reaſons that excite my joy. And with modeſty may I not attempt the moraliſt, ſo far as to obſerve, that as this is the greateſt quarter of the world and the laſt in diſcovery, we may here ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally expect the laſt and greateſt works of Deity. I mean thoſe which are to be accompliſhed in the gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en age. From ſome cauſe or other, I am irreſiſtibly inclined to believe, that this is the hemiſphere on which the morning of that day will firſt dawn, and ſhine back from weſt to eaſt till the light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Saviour ſhall illuminate the world. Will not this, at leaſt in part, be a fulfilment of his own words? that the laſt ſhall be firſt and the firſt laſt. And to ſtrengthen the idea, may I not bring to view the prophetic deſcription of that approaching day: for is not this the wilderneſs and ſolitary place that ſhall be made glad, and the deſert that ſhall bloſſom as the roſe? But whether this be the effect of fancy or not, I leave you to judge, and ſubſcribe myſelf your</p>

               </opener>
               <p>THERE are many things in theory which are not capable of practical proof; theſe as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute little to the benefit of mankind, I rank in the lower claſs of literature. You doubtleſs remember when we were ſchoolmates, how philoſophically our profeſſor would harangue upon the original particles of matter, and the ſimples of nature. For my part I find no ſuch ſimples; what is there that is uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded. Univerſal nature is a mixture of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ingredients, and to every earthly enjoyment there is a <hi>contra</hi> part annexed; one thing is ſet over againſt the other that man ſhould find nothing after him. Theſe in degree are uſually proportionate to each other, and it is often the caſe that the greateſt contraſt of pleaſure and pain ariſes from thoſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which lie neareſt the heart. How does the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther joy and grieve, yea, as it were live and die, with the child of her boſom.</p>
               <p>When I firſt perceived the connection I was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with America, and how inſeperably my affection was united to her intereſt, I was not inſenſible from the nature of things, to what a viciſſitude of paſſions I was fated. The idea at firſt ſtartled me; but I at length freely ſubmitted, to what my love had made irreſiſtible.</p>
               <p>In my former letter I took my leave of you, as if
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018944_0016_0FA90BB0CE6B0E28"/>
with Moſes upon the mount, borne away with the riſing glory of America. I now ſit down in a more humble ſtyle; to lay before you thoſe threatning ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of a political and moral nature, which pain my heart. In the civil conſtitution of America, each ſtate with reſpect to its own internal police, holds a ſovereignty of its own; but for mutual defence, they are organized into one great body, over which then Congreſs preſide, compoſed of a proportionable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of delegates from each ſtate. In this body was deſigned to be lodged the ſupreme authority of the nation; but being inveſted with their power, at a time when tyranny had rendered the very name of power unpopular, the ſtates fell ſhort of the mark, and by their reſtrictions incapacitated their ruling body, for the diſcharge of the duty to which the very nature of their office led them. I am ſenſible that the ruler has no power but what is derived to him from the people; yet the nature of all government requires that he ſhould have ſo much as to rule for their good, to encourage the virtuous and puniſh the vicious. Congreſs in ſome things of the greateſt importance, have only a right to recommend to their conſtituent aſſemblies, what they judge intereſting to the public weal; and however urgent the exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the nation may be with regard to theſe, yet they muſt paſs the litigation of each aſſembly before Congreſs are empowered to act; and even then we find it may be the caſe, that one of the thirteen will negative the whole. When I was firſt made acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the powers of Congreſs, I was ſenſible of the defect, and equally ſenſible that ſuch was the jealouſy of the people, in delegating power to their rulers, that nothing but experience could convince them of the miſtake. And experience has already begun
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018944_0017_0FA90BB1817CC490"/>
to do its office, and by the irreparable loſs of an immenſt intereſt, has adminiſtered more conviction to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace, than volumes on the ſubject would have done. I mean in the continental impoſt recommended by Congreſs to the ſeveral ſtates. This was an expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for canceling the public debt, that diſcovered great wiſdom and ſound policy. It would have done honour to the oldeſt ſenate on the globe: for it eaſes the induſtrious farmer and draws the revenue from the opulent; or at leaſt being laid upon the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities of life, no one pays any part of it but of choice.</p>
               <p>The ſtates ſoon diſcovered their intereſt in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation, and adopted the plan, all except the ſtate of Rhode-Iſland which has negatived the whole. And there being no authority to remedy the evil; or chaſtiſe their ſtubbornneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the nation has already loſt a revenue; I preſume of greater value than the ſtate itſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A few more leſſons of ſuch a ſerious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as this; will likely convince the people that it is not for their intereſt in this manner to reſtrict the ſupreme legiſlature of the nation. Congreſs muſt have more than a name or power of recommendation, in order to act for the good of the whole. However, we may perhaps attribute this defect not ſo much to a want of wiſdom as to thoſe inevitable prejudices to which human nature is incident. At the time when America left her parent country and forever diſſolved that tender relation which had ſo long ſubſiſted, it was done under the higheſt provocation; there was the greateſt affront offered to human reaſon and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: the Britiſh miniſtry given up to a ſpirit of infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, aſſerted a right of making laws binding them in all caſes whatever; from this awful ſpectre they
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018944_0018_0FA90BB260EF2318"/>
fled; and in this perturbation of mind, they were driven by the laws of ſelf preſervation to form a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of their own. It is not therefore ſtrange under theſe circumſtances, that a jealouſy of power ſhould be ſo great as to operate to their diſadvantage. When with the greateſt caution we are endeavouring to ſhun one extreme, we are almoſt certain to ſtrike the other, <hi>humanum eſt errare.</hi> Add to this the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of civil government has in all ages of the world been found one of the moſt delicate ſubjects on which human wiſdom has ever been employed, and the prodigal delegation of power has often been attended with the moſt pernicious conſequences. That from theſe conſiderations I rather think it ſtrange, that the ſtates have not made greater miſtakes in their conſtitution than what at preſent appear. This apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogy for the people you will readily ſee reſults from the nature of things, rather than from too great a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice in their favour. You will not impute it to a want of candour on the ſubject, though I paſs over many ſmaller matters that are not altogether agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, for this would introduce a prolixity not ſuitable in a letter. Was I to give my opinion with reſpect to the ſeveral legiſlatures individually, I ſhould judge the members which compoſe the greater part of their aſſemblies, much too numerous; if they were leſſened half or more, it would expedite their buſineſs with leſs expence: nor if done by the voice of the people, could it in the leaſt endanger their liberties. But not to enlarge here; I ſhall take the liberty to obſerve further upon the public oeconomy of the ſtates. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps never was a people under better advantage to become great and rich than the Americans, or more circumſtances be found any where ariſing from ſoil, climate, and ſituation, to render a people indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018944_0019_0FA90BB2FB0F2018"/>
of the reſt of the world. However from prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of benevolence I am no enemy to commerce, when regulated by wiſdom and ſound policy. At preſent the ſtates appear exceedingly wanting in this oeconomy; and much like the young trader, whoſe object is to fill his ſtore without thinking that a day of payment will ever come. The advantage, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of trade, depends on two things, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of a people, and the manner in which it is conducted. There may be natural and perhaps remedileſs cauſes that render a foreign trade diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to a people. If they are not poſſeſſed of commodities to exchange for what they receive from other nations, and of more than what is neceſſary for their own conſumption; trade in this caſe will not only rob them of the ſupports of life, but plunge them into debt. Poland is a living example in proof of this obſervation; they are poſſeſſed of ſcarce any trading commodity, except corn, which is one of their capital ſupports. The lands are chiefly owned by lords, who oppreſs their tenants, and take from them this ſtaff of life, that by it they may feed their own luxury in trade with other nations. Under theſe circumſtances it would be happy for the Polanders if they had no trade opened with any part of the globe. It is not ſo with the Americans, they are poſſeſſed of a variety of commodities, a conſiderable proportion of which may be ſpared in foreign trade, and by exchanging them for the manufactures and produce of other nations, would be greatly to their advantage. But in national trade the exports ſhould be made to anſwer the imports, otherwiſe it will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever drain a people of their caſh; this will diſturb their internal police, and render almoſt every member of the community in ſome degree uncomfortable.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018944_0020_0FA90BB3C1111628"/>
There muſt be public as well as domeſtic oeconomy: nor is it poſſible for a people any more than a family, to flouriſh without it. At preſent the balance of trade lies exceeding heavy againſt the ſtates, and it is daily increaſing; the evil already operates; the people complain of the great ſcarcity of caſh, but are gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally blind to the cauſe. In almoſt every ſhip bound for Europe their caſh is exported in large quantities, and there exchanged, at leaſt in part, for thoſe toys and ſuperfluities of which nature has no demand, and which tend to empoveriſh the buyer as much as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich the ſeller. It would be happy for the ſtates, was their Congreſs conſtitutionally authoriſed to levy a duty upon all European ſuperfluities, that would either wholly diſcourage the trade, or if continued ſerve to lighten their public burden. It is indeed ſtrange that the ſenſibility of the ſtates has diſcovered no more jealouſy of this bait when laid by an enemy: for the Britiſh nation are no more friends to America now, than when their ſword was unſheathed. All their pacific pretentions are but the product of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; their ſword failed of conqueſt, and they are now trying the art of trade; and will you call it a groundleſs fear? ſhould I ſay, that there may be more danger from this quarter, than from their arms. I mean not to inſinuate by this, that I am under fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful apprehenſions leſt they may again obtain the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of the ſtates; but by plunging them deep in debt, bankruptcy will become frequent in the mercantile part of the community, and in every ſuch inſtance the public is more or leſs injured, not only as it robs them of their caſh, but as it will give Great Britain a foothold in their landed property. For when the commodities and caſh of the ſtates fail, this muſt ſecure the creditor; on this is grounded the above
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018944_0021_0FA90BB5C9068FE8"/>
obſervation, that there may be more danger from Britiſh trade than Britiſh arms: for by the latter they conquered no part of America, but by the former they may acquire much. It is eaſier for us to injure another under the diſguiſe of friendſhip, than when there is no ſuch artifice made uſe of to hide the intent. Hence the wiſe precaution of the Trojan prieſt againſt receiving the Grecian horſe within their walls, <hi>Timeo Danaos dona ferentes.</hi> Trade naturally carries with it the pretext of friendſhip, though like the above mentioned horſe it may be charged with death. Great-Britain is crowding in her goods of every kind upon the ſtates, and the people blind to the fraud ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear equally zealous in purchaſing. It would be greatly for their intereſt, would they look forward to the approaching evil that muſt hence reſult, depend more on their own manufactures, and purchaſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what neceſſity demands.</p>
               <p>The intereſt of a people has a greater concern in their taſte for living than we are apt to imagine; when this is conformed to, and governed by their circumſtances, it is happy, and no leſs pernicious when ſuffered to run at large without any ſuch rule. When a private perſon or family, live beyond their circumſtances, trouble will inevitably follow, and the obſervation is equally true with reſpect to the public. America lives too faſt for a people ſo young, who have ſo lately paſſed their minority, and whoſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for acquiring wealth as yet, has been ſo ſmall. It diſcovers a bad taſte and great vanity, to think at preſent of imitating older nations in their ſuperfluities and grandeur. Every thing of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould be deſpiſed till their public debt the price of their redemption is fully diſcharged. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monality
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018944_0022_0FA90BB7502E41F8"/>
take the higher rank of people for the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of faſhion, and governed by a falſe taſte, they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the imitation to the great detriment of their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate as well as the public intereſt. Hence the plough boy is ruffled, and the kitchen maid in her head-dreſs, rivals the lady of fortune; and hence it is, that Great Britain finds ſuch a market in America for thoſe gaudes and nenſenſical ſuperfluities, which are a moth to the world. Did this rank of people conceive the influence which their example has on the public welfare, I am ſure if friends to their country, they would ſtudy the greateſt ſimplicity and frugali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of life. I readily confeſs the idea I had formed of America in this reſpect was imaginary. When I left my native country, I indulged the pleaſurable thought of leaving all the follies and fopperies of faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion behind me; I fancied the American taſte too noble and philoſophic to be endangered by any thing in its nature ſo perfectly empty; but to my great grief I find that theſe have followed, or rather gone before me into the country, where I expect to ſpend the reſidue of my life. I am now travelling through the ſtate of Connecticut on my way eaſtward; a few evenings paſt I took lodging at a plantation about twenty miles from one of their market towns, I was told the town had lately been incorporated with city privileges. My landlord I found in ill humour, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing not a little diſcontent, with regard to the difficulty of the times; it is natural for me when troubles of any kind appear, to examine into the cauſe; in this inſtance an indirect method of coming at the matter appeared the moſt feaſible. I therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to him, that the country had obtained the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their conflict, their army was now diſbanded, in conſequence of which their public taxes were much
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018944_0023_0FA90BB7F6D0DE10"/>
lightened: and beſide his farm appeared exceeding good and well managed; and that under theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances we might rationally ſuſpect whether his complaints were not groundleſs. The good man replied, that in the moſt diſtreſſing ſeaſon of the war, when he had a ſoldier to hire and equip for ſervice, and when public taxes were the heavieſt, he could with much more eaſe and punctuality diſcharge his obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations than now. The pork, beef and grain raiſed on his farm and carried to market, had annually diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged his public taxes;—he obſerved that few Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean manufactures were then in the country, and ſcarce any of the ſuperfluous kind: they were hence neceſſitated to induſtry within doors, and to follow the ſtricteſt rules of family oeconomy. They manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factured their own apparel, both for male and female with very little exception, and it was then decent and reputable in any company; but would now ſcarcely anſwer for a common dreſs. My landlord was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in relating to me the time and circumſtances that firſt introduced his troubles; he had a large fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of ſons and daughters, two of which not long after the declaration of peace made a viſit to the city, —they diſcovered pleaſure and ſatisfaction when they went from home, but returned with a very different countenance. The affectionate father immediately inquiring into the cauſe found it to be this;—the ſon had met with an acquaintance of his in the city, who was dreſſed in a very genteel ſuit of broadcloth and ſilk;—the daughter ſaw a lady walking the ſtreet with a new faſhioned hat, ornamented with ſome remarkable torſels, and one of the moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful feathers ſhe ever ſaw. They found the ſtore where they were to be ſold, inquired the price, which they ſaid was exceeding low. The good man repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:018944_0024_0FA90BB9821B5268"/>
to his ſon that his dreſs was ſuch as they could af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, it was neat, plain and manly; and that his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter either as a man of ſenſe, or wholeſome mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſociety, would never ſuffer from this quarter. And turning to his daughter he obſerved, that they had a great variety of poultry on the farm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> among which there was a rich diverſity of colours, and ſhe might pluck a feather from which ſhe pleaſed, would ſhe only be content. But arguments availed little<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the diſcontent diſturbed the tranquility of the houſe till the articles were purchaſed; theſe brought into the family; had the like effect upon the other children. The diſſatisfaction which the partial hand of a parent creates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> began to diſcover itſelf in a very ſerious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. The old gentleman now ſeemed driven by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to go the round in the trade he had begun, and he obſerved it had ever ſince been little ſhort of a continued round of faſhions, introduced by the new city on which they bordered. The ſupport of faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion he found to be the heavieſt tax that he ever paid; the produce of his farm had always cleared him of the others, but in this it failed. The incomes and charges of his family he found to leſs and leſs compare, and the balance againſt him daily increaſing. He told me that if this loſs of intereſt had been ſupplied with an increaſe of family happineſs, the exchange would give him no trouble; but the reverſe of this was in truth the caſe; domeſtick happineſs had forſaken him; contentment the near companion of ſimplicity and frugality was no more. His family was like the veſſel in a troubled ſea, toſſed from faſhion to faſhion, ever reaching after new and ſatisfied with none. He lamented this great and ſudden corruption of taſte; the difficulty of ſtemming the torrent; and that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt he had acquired by hard induſtry, ſhould in this manner be waſted by prodigality.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:018944_0025_0FA90BB9B96CD610"/>I conceive it natural for us to pity moſt, when leaſt able to lend aſſiſtance; I am ſure it was ſo with me; I more ſenſibly felt for the man, becauſe I knew it was out of my power to give relief. And in this painful exerciſe of mind I parted with my unfortunate friend. However the inſtruction I received, was a liberal reward for the ſympathetic pain I endured in the conference. In this family I had a ſtriking pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the community at large: for there is ſuch a likeneſs between the nature of a family and the body politic, that the ſame oeconomy that is requiſite for the proſperity of the one, is equally neceſſary for the other. And the ſame corruption of taſte when it is generally diffuſed through a community, will oper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate as much to their diſadvantage, as it will to the diſadvantage of a family or individual.</p>
               <p>I am ſenſible that the popular remark on ſubjects of this nature is diſcouraging;—<hi>you may as well ſtop the courſe of nature as of faſhion, it muſt and will have its career.</hi>—I feel the difficulty,—however view it not in ſuch a deſperate point of light. Public evil I acknowledge is not a promiſing motive, to urge for private reformation; but convince a perſon where his own intereſt lies and he will generally attend; or under perſonal troubles point him to a remedy, and he will uſually purſue it.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="unknown:018944_0026_0FA90BBC2372EBB0"/>
affords a very natural and powerful motive to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation: for here the ſame thing that is the cauſe of private and domeſtic happineſs, is a remedy to the public evil.—I am ſure every perſon of ſenſibility, may eaſily trace the troubles which at preſent threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the ſtates to this origin, <hi>the want of domeſtic oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy.</hi> —The Americans too much like the reſt of the world live at random; their private and family af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs are conducted without method. And this ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it a matter of entire chance, whether they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or ſink their intereſt; and ſhould an intereſt be gotten in this way, it merits no honour, and if loſt, it deſerves as little pity. Every member of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity ſhould reduce his affairs as near as poſſible to a ſyſtem, like the well bred merchant methodiſe all his domeſtic buſineſs, compute the neceſſary expence of his family, bring into the charge the whole of his public taxes, and annually plan and execute his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs accordingly; and if in the cloſe of the year the balance is in his favour, it is his own; he may pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe with it what he pleaſes, without injuring the public or diſturbing the tranquility of his family. All this may be done without metaphiſical or mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical ſkill; the moſt illiterate who have no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in figures may adjuſt the matter with a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient degree of accuracy.

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018944_0027_0FA90BBE04C82EA0"/>
the diſorder which is now preying upon the politic life of the ſtates.—I have long viewed it a matter of wonder, that the oeconomy of human life, a ſcience in which public and private happineſs is ſo nearly concerned, is no more ſtudied. Without this, men do but blunder through the world; their paſſage is neither direct or regular; by this defect they ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice much of their worldly comfort—often violate the ſacred laws of juſtice, and never become ſuch wholeſome members of ſociety as they might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe do.

               <p>YOUR intimate acquaintance with ſacred and profane hiſtory, has doubtleſs led you to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that nations have their character as well as individuals: the criterion of diſtinction is perhaps no leſs viſible in the one than in the other. In na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we find that now and then one, will ſtep forward of their fellow-mortals, and in the regiſter of ſame rank high above the reſt. It is ſo likewiſe in the great family of Empires: one will ſometimes take the lead of the reſt in power, riches and honour, yea, in every point of view that will ſerve to characteriſe a nation as great. This diſtinction is not accidental, but ariſes from their moral and political virtue; or better to expreſs my idea, their religion in this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect is their policy; it is the operating cauſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in thoſe inſtances where God raiſes up a people for a temporary ſcourge, that they may fall in their turn, when this work is accompliſhed. The Jewiſh nation exemplifies the aſſertion: nor is the Aſſyrian monarchy leſs in favour of the exception. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent religions that have been embraced by differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent nations, is not only an evidence of human depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, but it likewiſe diſcovers the neceſſity of ſome religion in every body politic. It was from this principle that the king of the ten tribes, on their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt from the houſe of David, deified his golden calves. He was ſenſible that if the religion of Judah was adopted for theirs, in the new conſtitution they
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:018944_0029_0FA90BBF10AFFCE8"/>
were forming, it would endanger his throne; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equally ſenſible that ſome religion was neceſſary for the ſupport of civil government, he eſtabliſhed that of idolatry, though againſt the light of conſcience and revelation. Civil laws without the laws of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, have little influence on the mind: it is the latter which principally gives energy to the former. The more enlightned heathen convinced of this, had their prieſts who inculcated on the people the doctrine of the ſoul's immortality, and a future ſtate of retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution; they found this to be the beſt engine in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of civil policy; and being either ignorant of or unfriendly to revelation, their invention from age to age was employed on the ſubject, as a matter in which national intereſt is nearly concerned. Nor did they fall in their deſign—their religion, bad as it was, rendered their laws more energetic and influenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the people: hope and fear the ruling paſſions of the mind, were kept alive in this way; and being directed by their religion to a future world had that power over the community, that no civil laws could have had without it.—The hiſtory of the Roman and Grecian republics, is a living example of this truth. But we who are favoured with the goſpel, and live in this enlightened age of the world, have no need to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our invention on the ſubject—the work is done to our hand, and it is done by unerring wiſdom: And notwithſtanding the object of this religion is far more ſublime than the ſupport of civil government, yet from no quarter does civil government receive ſuch aſſiſtance as from this.—Indeed ſhould we like the deiſtical civilian view it only in this point of light, as an engine to civil policy, all the wiſdom of the heathen ſages that has ever been employed on the ſubject, appears but folly. For there is no moral
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:018944_0030_0FA90BC08D73B5D8"/>
ſyſtem whatever that gives ſuch a ſpring to action as this,—none that ſo excites, directs, and governs the paſſions of the human mind;—in this an approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing retribution ceaſes to be conjecture, nor does the truth of it depend on the well connected reaſon of the philoſopher; but on the word of him who is truth itſelf.—The principles which it inculcates are of the pureſt kind, enforced by the ſtrongeſt motives; nor does it enjoin or forbid any thing, but what tends to form both the ruler and ſubject to their reſpective duties; to theſe they are mutually urged by the hope of future happineſs and the dread of future miſery. This is connecting private happineſs with the public good; and this my friend is the religion of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; —there never was any artifice made uſe of by the wiſeſt politician, that was ſo naturally calculated for the good of civil ſociety:—it is ſo on the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of reaſon, were we to leave a ſuperintending pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence out of the queſtion.—If then ſome religion is neceſſary for every body politic, and if the chriſtian religion (I mean as held by the proteſtants) is found to be the moſt conſiſtent and ſalutary in its tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; it is of the moſt intereſting concern to a people, that this be laid as a foundation ſtone, on which to build their conſtitution. I am far from entertaining the idea that the great end of religion is to give en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergy to civil law: for this would be to ſubordinate the greater to the leſs. The deſign of civil government is to ſecure the lives, liberties and properties of the ſubjects, and to aid and protect them while paſſing through this world to a better. Certainly then the legiſlator that makes civil government the ultimate object of religion, muſt invert the order; nor, upon his own principles, does he leſs miſtake his policy when he does not frame the conſtitution in favour and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:018944_0031_0FA90BC15099E0C0"/>
ſupport of religion, ſince from this it derives its life and ſpirit. The American ſtates like the new mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried pair are ſetting out for themſelves in the world; their conſtitutions are formed and forming by their ſeveral legiſlatures; and as it is of importance to the one, ſo is it to the other, that they ſet out right, and are agreed in the principles of religion: for ſameneſs of religion has a natural tendency to ſtrengthen the bond of union.</p>
               <p>I am pleaſed to find that ſome of the ſtates in their conſtitutions diſcover a ſacred regard to religion; nor am I leſs diſpleaſed to find it neglected by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, even where I ſhould have leaſt imagined ſuch a defect.—The ſtates of Maſſachuſetts and New-Hampſhire have in effect ſevered it from their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution; their new code of laws neither ſupport a public worſhip, nor that religious profeſſion who are ordained by heaven to wait at the altar; at leaſt after the preſent claſs are gone off the ſtage.—Surely they have forgotten the God to whom they ſo lately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed in their diſtreſs; otherwiſe they could not in this public manner have given up his worſhip, and withdrawn the civil ſupport from that order of men appointed to ſacred office. Such policy as this will prove deſtructive in whatever ſtate it is admitted; it will gradually root out a learned and able clergy; bring public worſhip not only into neglect, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; hence immoralities of every kind will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, which like a mortal conſumption will prey up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſeat of politic life. I am no bigot to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſuaſion, while I believe in my own, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low myſelf neither to diſpiſe or ridicule that of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I am therefore fond of the general toleration that is given in the ſtates to every denomination of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:018944_0032_0FA90BC203AC71E8"/>
chriſtians, both upon the principle of ſound policy and the real ſpirit of chriſtianity; for a man's mind is his kingdom, and if liberty is ever deſirable, it is in the choice of that religion on which we build the ſalvation of the ſoul. But this is altogether differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from parting with religion by wholeſale: let the chriſtian worſhip be eſtabliſhed by the conſtitution, and then let every man worſhip according to the dictates of his own conſcience: for the civil commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity cannot flouriſh without it, where this is wanting, the laws like the parts of a diſtempered body will ceaſe to do their office, when diſſolution in a courſe of nature muſt follow. Could we therefore diſcard the idea of a future world from the ſubject, it would be of great advantage to the community to ſupport the chriſtian worſhip: for it preſerves order—begets mutual love—and tends to breathe into every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject thoſe principles of duty and morality which are of the laſt importance to the public weal. <hi>There is,</hi> ſays Solomon, <hi>that ſcattereth and yet increaſeth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to poverty.</hi> And never perhaps is this obſervation more ſtrikingly exemplified than in the caſe before us, experience will ſoon convince the abovementioned ſtates, that they have miſtaken their policy and hit wide of the mark at which they aimed. However I am leſs diſpoſed to wonder at New-Hampſhire than Maſſachuſetts in this matter, it is natural to ſuppoſe that the latter as it is older, larger and more opulent, ſhould influence the former in their politics, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when we conſider them bordering on each other. But this politic evil I think eaſily accounted for, from that general corruption of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  <pb n="33" facs="unknown:018944_0033_0FA90BC2C24DC860"/>When their civil and religious order has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to me—their ſtrict attention to the ſabbath, and the ſolemn ſilence that reigned in their ſtreets on holy time; I have admired their character, and often wiſhed myſelf the happineſs of being a member of their community. But from perſonal acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, I find this happy period gone—their civil and religious order, as is always the caſe, have fled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—their ſabbaths are deſpiſed—and that God whoſe name I mention with reverence, is profaned in their ſtreets. I lament the apoſtacy, and ſincerely pity the people rendered unhappy by their own folly. My former affection often urges me to believe, that their wiſdom cannot overlook the cauſe of this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs; and I ſhould hence be induced to expect a reformation, was I not ſenſible how hard it is in this reſpect to recover loſt ground. When vice is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured and bound by law, it is difficult to conceive that the rulers of a people can be too watchful and ſtrict in keeping of it confined; a little relaxation of the cord may appear trifling, and is often plead for as neceſſary, but viewed in its tendency it is a kind of high treaſon,—it is at leaſt an indirect attempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the commonwealth;—in this way vice by ſlow degrees gets at helm, and the community after many painful and perilous ſtruggles is often ſhipwrecked. I have obſerved while paſſing through the ſtates, that the legiſlative authority appear much better to fill their place than the executive. The laws are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wholeſome, and pointed with a manly ſpirit againſt whatever may threaten the good of the community: but the informing officers, and thoſe entruſted with the execution of the laws, have for ſuch a courſe of time been lax in their duty, that the zeal which the commonwealth demands of them, has in ſome reſpects
<pb n="34"
                      facs="unknown:018944_0034_0FA90BC37B334DD0"

become unpopular.—This in a community is a dan<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gerous ſymptom,—if men cannot diſcharge their <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> without incurring the diſpleaſure of their fellow ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, they will be apt either to turn their backs on the office, or indifferently do their duty when it is urged upon them. It is much eaſier to compile than to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute the law;—men therefore of the greateſt ſtabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and who are leaſt tempted by the bait of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar applauſe, ſhould be entruſted with the execution of the law. It is a common defect in civil policy, that too little attention is paid to the appointment of informing and executive officers; by theſe means wholeſome laws often fail of being executed; and this tends to bring both the law and legiſlature into contempt,—yea it enervates the whole politic ſyſtem. I have often thought it better for the community to have a law, however ſalutary in its nature, wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed, than to ſtand in force without execution. It will be plead I am ſenſible that it is a reſtraint on ſome; but when we conſider the miſchief that it does to other laws, and the wound it gives to civil authority, I believe the diſadvantage here ariſing to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, will be found to preponderate. I am likewiſe led to conceive, that informing and executive officers are no leſs criminal for their deficiency in truſt, than the open violators of law, who through their neglect paſs with impunity. Men who in this manner are ſet as centinels to guard the commonwealth, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with a charge of the moſt weighty kind, their fidelity can ſcarcely be too much applauded, or their neglect too ſeverely reprobated. Is not an aſſault up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſingle life, a crime that juſtly kindles our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt the inhuman perpetrator? How then can we feel cool towards the criminals, who in this indirect way threaten the politic ſalvation of thouſands? No brand of infamy deſerves a deeper
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:018944_0035_0FA90BC45D55CBD0"/>
impreſſion, than that in which the public intereſt is concerned;—perſonal injuries we may forgive: but thoſe which reſpect the public, we have neither a right to forgive nor conceal—much leſs have thoſe ſuch a right, whoſe duty it is to diſcover and avenge the wrong. The commonwealth is like a ſhip at ſea, whoſe ſafety and ſucceſs depends on the ſkill and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity of the managers, they may conduct her to the deſired port, or run her upon ſome unfriendly ſhore: as wiſdom and truſt is requiſite in the one caſe, ſo is it in the other.</p>
               <p>America is now entered on the voyage in which many nations have ſhipwrecked; and as her courſe is to be ſhaped and directed by her own ſkill, ſhe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too cautious to whoſe hands the management is committed. Nor can the managers have too great a ſenſe of their truſt; I ſenſibly feel for the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and faithful on whoſe ſhoulders the burden lies: nor do I leſs deſpiſe the ſtupid wretch that neglects his duty, and can trifle with concerns ſo intereſting as thoſe of the public weal.</p>
               <p>In one ſenſe I have little to riſk in this voyage, and in another perhaps no man ventures more than myſelf; for my happineſs with the common intereſt is freighted on board; my love to the riſing nation I have joined forbids the enjoyment in this life, unleſs ſucceſs attends it. O America if I forget thee, let my right hand forget her cunning, if I do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I prefer not America above my chief joy.</p>
               <p>I have now compleated my tour through the ſtates; for the moſt part I have paſſed <hi>incognito,</hi> which has given me the beſt advantage for ſpeculation; and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:018944_0036_0FA90BC4FAC760E8"/>
theſe ſpeculations I have ſpread before you, with that unreſerved freedom peculiar to friendſhip: yea I have expreſſed to you the exerciſes of my heart, with all the impartiality of which I am maſter. In the leave I am now taking of my friend, you will doubtleſs wiſh to know in what part of America a letter may hereafter find me. This choice of ſituation, you likely remember, I reſerved for an after period, when I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected aſſiſtance from an acquaintance with the whole. My purpoſe I confeſs is different from what it then was: I find it impoſſible to take up my reſidence in any town through which I have paſſed, without too great a connection with thoſe things which to me fall among the diſagreeables of the world. The buſtle and confuſion which attends a city life, is to me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding irkſome; or to become a ſlave to the faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of the town, and undertake their taſk of ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious flattery in which my tongue was never ſkilled, would be no leſs diſagreeable. I am therefore reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a rural life of the moſt retired kind; in the weſtern wilds of America there is extent ſufficient for my retreat: here beyond the reach of faſhion or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of taſte, I mean to bring up my family, which at preſent have but an ideal exiſtence. As thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>located lands ſettle faſt, I expect to travel far in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to execute my deſign. I ſhall take with me a ſelect number of friends, in the collection of which I uſe the greateſt precaution: though a ſmall, yet we propoſe to go in ſome reſpects an organized body; for we have an able preacher of the goſpel, and no leſs able inſtructer for our children, who are engaged in the adventure. Here by the leave of providence I purpoſe to try how far induſtry connected with the greateſt ſimplicity of habit and manners, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the happineſs of life. Since I have been
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:018944_0037_0FA90BC5C4D7A3A8"/>
in the country, I have paid no ſmall attention to the art of farming; I have learned how to fell the timber, and have acquired the uſe of almoſt every inſtrument of huſbandry: I have conſulted the beſt ſeaſons for ſowing the ſeed, and the ſoil moſt ſuitable for each particular kind; and as I expect to devote myſelf to this agreeable employ, I hope by experience, with what little philoſophy I am maſter of, to become a tolerable proficient. Should you object to my plan as diſcovering a want of benevolence, and think me fleeing from thoſe neceſſary burdens, in which I ought to ſhare in common with my fellow citizens; I have only to obſerve that I am no politician, and therefore conceive of little good I could do the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, however much I might intereſt myſelf in its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. In the execution of this deſign, my proſpect of doing good is conſiderable, that in my view of the matter, benevolence is much in my favour. The force of bad example by theoriſing on the ſubject, I have conceived to be very great: but this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I expect will give the <hi>quantum,</hi> or ſhow how great it is. I have been told that a child, meerly for the ſake of experiment, has been brought up wholly ſecluded from means of knowledge, and as much as poſſible from human ſociety: but this would be to brutalize and not to humanize the mind. Our view is wide from any thing of this nature; for we carry with us the beſt means both of human and divine knowledge: our object is to evade that corruption of taſte and faſhion, which diſtempers the politic ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem and preys upon the happineſs of domeſtic life. And although we expect that human depravity will accompany the adventure, yet we hope to eſcape thoſe outward immoralities, which to the ſhame of rational <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, prevail in town and city. A very

laudible attention to the education of youth, appears to be general through the ſtates: but after all the good which it promiſes, there is this evil which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it, the child is ſo converſant with the popular taſte, his eyes ſo frequently turned on bad exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that theſe neceſſarily become a part of his edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. The latter we expect wholly to eſcape, while the former is carried to its higheſt perfection. From a family or community bred up in this manner I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs I have the moſt raiſed expectation; indeed the proſpect in almoſt every point of view looks promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. I am ſenſible that there are conveniences and I may add neceſſaries of life, which our lands will not produce, to obtain which we deſign to open a trade with the neareſt market town: but in the uſe of theſe we ſhall be exceeding frugal, as the diſtance of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation will render them expenſive. The trade is to be conducted only by thoſe who are the moſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached friends to our ſimplicity, that the idea of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign ſuperfluities may forever be withheld from our children; or at leaſt to the time when age and the force of education ſhall fortify them againſt the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. As my diſpoſition has undergone no materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al change ſince I left London, you will not ſuſpect this enterpriſe to ariſe from any ſour unſociable turn, which I have newly taken; for friendſhip and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom I more and more admire, at the ſame time am more and more convinced that this lies within the circle of a few: and that an attempt to enlarge the limits, or indulge intimacy with thoſe unacquainted with the delicacy of friendſhip, would be rather an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let to pain than pleaſure. My views I am ſure are not ambitious; I am not ſeeking the honour of one that is the founder of an empire; nor to have the little community which I have the honour to collect,
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:018944_0039_0FA90BC78FEDAEB8"/>
hereafter in hiſtoric page called by my name; but the good of poſterity, in connection with my own happineſs in life, are the objects at which I am driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Thus far I confeſs my deſigns ſelfiſh in the matter, that my own comfort in the world is one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the enterpriſe; however I truſt it is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the laws of chriſtianity, as not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of one that might better claim the honour of your friendſhip than myſelf.</p>
               <p>You will ſurely gratify me ſo far as to ſuffer your imagnation for a moment to accompany my retreat into theſe weſtern wilds. How happy thus to retire from the confuſion of the world, and as it were by one leap to eſcape its greateſt diſagreeables. Here nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ambition to fill the ſeats of the great, nor fear of being diſplaced from offices of honour and profit can diſturb the mind; induſtry the companion of virtue and happineſs will be our dependence. Methinks I can already ſee thoſe ſtately pines falling before us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the green herbage ſmiling around us, and that wilderneſs by the art of agriculture bloſſoming as the roſe. Methinks I hear the lowing of the ox and the bleating of the ſheep, where beaſts untamed from the beginning have held poſſeſſion, and from this rural retired ſcene I anticipate great ſatisfaction.
