         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Compiler of the following ſheets, ſenſible that nothing new can be ſaid upon the following intricate doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of Predeſtination, Election and Reprobation, has no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to impoſe upon the Public—but in a plain, humble and conciſe manner, republiſh thoſe doctrines unveiled from that ſophiſtry, art and prolixity, ſo frequently experienced in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern publications of this kind, from which the community at large can derive no benefit, for the want of time, education and ſkill to trace the metaphyſical ſubtilties of Calvinian wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

               <hi>elect according to the foreknowledge of</hi> God <hi>the Father, through ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of the ſpirit, unto obedience.</hi> And St. Paul ſaith unto them,<note n="‖" place="bottom">2 Theſſ. ii. 13, 24.</note> God <hi>hath from the beginning choſen you to ſalvation, through ſanctification of the ſpirit, and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing of the glory of our</hi> Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. From all theſe places of ſcripture it is plain that God had choſen ſome to life and glory before, or from the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world. And the wiſdom of all Chriſtians is, to labour that their judgments may be informed herein, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſcripture. And to that end let us conſider the manner of God's ſpeaking to the ſons of men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. God ſaith to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Rom. iv. 17. <hi>As it is written, I have made thee a father of many nations, before him who believed, even</hi> God <hi>who quickeneth the dead and calleth things that are not as though they were.</hi> Obſerve, God ſpeaks then, at that preſent time, to <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaying, <hi>I have made thee a father of many nations,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding Abraham was not at that time the father of one child, but <hi>Iſhmael.</hi> How then muſt we underſtand <hi>I have made thee a father of many nations?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The apoſtle tells us plainly, it was ſo, <hi>Before</hi> God <hi>who calleth things that are not as though they were.</hi> And ſo he calleth <hi>Abraham, the father of many nations,</hi> though he was not as yet the father even of <hi>Iſaac, in whom his ſeed was to be called.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. God uſeth the ſame manner of ſpeaking, when he calleth Chriſt,<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xiii. 8.</note> 
               <hi>The lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world;</hi> although indeed he was not ſlain for ſome thouſand years after. Hence therefore we may eaſily underſtand what he ſpeaketh of <hi>elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us from the foundation of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. God calleth <hi>Abraham a father of many nations,</hi> though not ſo at that time. He calleth <hi>Chriſt, The Lamb ſlain from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the world,</hi> though not ſlain till he was a man in the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:029479_0009_0FE13B4A71077F98"/>fleſh. Even ſo he calleth men <hi>Elected from the foundation of the world,</hi> though not elected till they were men in the fleſh.— Yet it is all ſo before God, who knowing all things from eternity, <hi>calleth things that are not as though they were.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. By all which it is clear, that as Chriſt was called <hi>The Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world,</hi> and yet not ſlain till ſome thouſand years after, till the day of his death; ſo alſo men are called <hi>elect from the foundation of the world,</hi> and yet are not elected perhaps till ſome thouſand years after, till the day of their converſion to God.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And indeed this is plain, without going farther, from thoſe very words of St. Peter, <hi>elect, according to the fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of</hi> God, <hi>through ſanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience.</hi>— For,</p>
            <p>If the elect are choſen through ſanctification of the Spirit, then they were not choſen before they were ſanctified by the Spirit. But they were not ſanctified by the Spirit, before they had a being. It is plain then neither were they choſen from the foundation of the world. But God <hi>calleth things that are not, as though they were.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. This is alſo plain from thoſe words of St. Paul, God <hi>hath from the beginning choſen you to ſalvation, through ſanctification of the ſpirit, and belief of the truth.</hi> Now,</p>
            <p>If the ſaints are choſen to ſalvation, through believing of the truth, and were called to believe that truth by the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the goſpel, then they were not choſen before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the truth, and before they heard the goſpel, whereby they were called to believe. For they were choſen through belief of the truth, and called to believe it by the goſpel.— Therefore they were not choſen before they believed; much leſs before they had a being, any more than Chriſt was ſlain before he had a being. So plain is it, that they were not elected, till they believed; although God <hi>calleth things that are not, as though they were.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. Again, how plain is it, where St. Paul ſaith, that they whom<note n="†" place="bottom">Epheſ. i. 11, 12.</note> God <hi>did predeſtinate, according to the council of his own will, to be the praiſe of his glory,</hi> were ſuch as did <hi>firſt truſt in</hi> Chriſt? And in the very next verſe, he ſaith that they <hi>truſted in</hi> Chriſt <hi>after they heard the word of truth,</hi> (not before.)— But they did not hear the word before they were born.— Therefore it is plain, the act of election is <hi>in time,</hi> though known of God before; who, according to his knowledge, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſpeaketh of the things <hi>which are not, as though they were.</hi>— And thus is the great-ſtumbling block about election taken away, that men may <hi>make their calling and election ſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="11">11. The ſcripture tells us as plainly what predeſtination
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:029479_0010_0FE13B530F637FB8"/>is; it is God's fore-appointing obedient believers to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not without, but <hi>according to his fore-knowledge</hi> of all their works, <hi>from the foundation of the world.</hi> And ſo likewiſe he predeſtinates or fore-appoints all diſobedient unbelievers to damnation, not without, but <hi>according to his fore-knowledge</hi> of all their works, <hi>from the foundation of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. We may conſider this a little farther. God from the foundation of the world, fore-knew all men's believing or not believing. And according to this his fore-knowledge, he choſe or elected all obedient believers, as ſuch, to ſalvation, and refuſed or <hi>reprobated</hi> all diſobedient unbelievers, as ſuch, to damnation. Thus the ſcriptures teach us to conſider <hi>elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>reprobation, according to the fore-knowledge of</hi> God <hi>from the foundation of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="13">13. But here ſome may object, that I hold our faith and obedience to be the cauſe of God's electing us to glory.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, I do hold, that faith in Chriſt producing obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him is <hi>a cauſe without which</hi> God elected none to glory; for we never read of God's electing to glory, any who lived and died diſobedient unbelievers. But I do not hold, that it is the <hi>cauſe for which</hi> he elects any: the contrary of this is eaſily ſhewn thus:</p>
            <p>Suppoſe my obedience is a cauſe of my election to ſalvation, What is the cauſe of my obedience? <hi>Anſ.</hi> My love to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But what is the cauſe of my love to Chriſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> My faith in Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But what is the cauſe of my faith in Chriſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The preaching of the goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But what is the cauſe of the preaching of the goſpel to us?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Chriſt's dying for us.</p>
            <p>But what is the cauſe of Chriſt's dying for us?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> God's great love of pity wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Thus all men may ſee that I do not hold God <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p n="1">1. God's great love of pity, where with he loved <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ons of men, even while they were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, was the cauſe of his ſending his Son to die for them; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the following ſcriptures:<note n="†" place="bottom">John iii. 16.</note> God <hi>ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, to the end that all who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>when we were yet without ſtrength, in due time</hi> Chriſt <hi>died for the ungodly.</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſt's dying for our ſins is the cauſe of the goſpel's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preached to us, as appears from thoſe ſcriptures,<note n="¶" place="bottom">Matt. xxviii. 18.</note> Jeſus <hi>came and ſpake unto them, ſaying, All power is given unto me in heaven and earth.

               <hi>How ſhall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? And how ſhall they hear without a preacher? So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of</hi> God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Men's believing is the cauſe of their juſtification, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from thoſe ſcriptures,<note n="‖" place="bottom">Acts xiii. 39.</note>

For elſe it could not have been glad tidings of great joy to all people; but rather ſad tidings to all thoſe for whom he died not.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We come now to the words of Chriſt himſelf, who knew his own buſineſs better than any man elſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if his teſtimony agree with theſe, we muſt needs be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that they are true.

               <hi>As Moſes lifted up the ſerpent in the Wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the Son of Man be lifted up, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life. For</hi> God <hi>ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> And now we will hear what the apoſtles ſay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this thing.<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>The love of Chriſt,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle Paul, <hi>conſtraineth us, before we thus judge, that if one died for all, then were all dead; and that he died for all that they which live ſhould not henceforth live unto themſelves, but unto him that died for them, and roſe again.</hi> And to Timothy he ſaith,<note n="**" place="bottom">1 Tim. ii. 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>There is one</hi> God, <hi>and one</hi> Mediator <hi>between</hi> God <hi>and man, the man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a ranſom for all, to be teſtified in due time.</hi> Again
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:029479_0014_0FE13B77E7FDF210"/>he ſaith to Titus,<note n="†" place="bottom">Tit. ii. 11.</note> 
               <hi>The grace of God, which bringeth ſalvation is all men, hath appeared.</hi> And yet again to the Hebrews,<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. ii. 9.</note> 
               <hi>That he, by the grace of</hi> God, <hi>taſted death for every man.</hi> And to this agreeth St. John, witneſſing,<note n="¶" place="bottom">1 John ii. 2.</note> 
               <hi>He is the propitiation for our ſins; and not for ours only, but alſo for the ſins of the whole world.</hi>— And again, ſpeaking of himſelf and the reſt of the apoſtles, he ſaith,<note n="‖" place="bottom">1 John iv. 14.</note> 
               <hi>We have ſeen and do teſtify that the Father ſent the Son, to be the Saviour of the world.</hi> Thus we have the teſtimony of all the prophets, of the angel of God, of Chriſt himſelf, and of his holy apoſtles, all agreeing together in one to prove, that Chriſt died for all mankind.</p>
            <p n="18">18. What then can they, who deny this, ſay? Why, they commonly ſay, <hi>All men,</hi> in theſe ſcriptures, does not mean <hi>all men,</hi> but only <hi>the elect;</hi> that <hi>every man</hi> here does not mean <hi>every man,</hi> but only every one of the elect; that <hi>the world</hi> does not mean the <hi>whole world,</hi> but only the world of believers: and that the <hi>whole world,</hi> in St. John's words, does not mean <hi>the whole world,</hi> but only the whole world of the elect.</p>
            <p n="19">19. To this ſhameleſs, ſenſeleſs evaſion, I anſwer thus:</p>
            <p>If the ſcripture no where ſpeaks of a world of believers or elect, then we have no ground, reaſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, pretence, or excuſe for ſaying, Chriſt d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed only for a world of believers or elect. But the ſcripture no where ſpeaks of ſuch a world. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we have no ground or pretence for ſpeaking thus.</p>
            <p>Nay, the ſcripture is ſo far from calling believers or elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons, <hi>the world,</hi> that they are every where in ſcripture plainly and expreſsly diſtinguiſhed from <hi>the world.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">John xv.</note> 
               <hi>If ye were of the world,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>the world would love its own; but becauſe I have choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="20">20. But let the ſcripture itſelf ſpeak, what world Chriſt died for.<note n="§" place="bottom">Rom. v. 6—10.</note> 
               <hi>When we were yet without ſtrength, Chriſt died for the ungodly. While we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us. When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son.</hi> From all which we may clearly ſee, that Chriſt died for the world of the ungodly, for the world of ſinners, for the world of his enemies; the juſt one for the world of the unjuſt. But the elect, as elect, are not unjuſt. Therefore he died not for the elect, as elect; but even for that world St. John ſpeaks of, when he ſays, "The whole world lieth in wickedneſs."</p>
            <p n="21">21. If it be ſaid, "The elect were ſinners once as well oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:" I anſwer, true; but not as they are elect in Chriſt, but as they were out of Chriſt, without hope and without God
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:029479_0015_0FE13B7D1B016038"/>in the world. Therefore, to ſay that Chriſt died for the elect, as elect, is abſolute nonſenſe and confuſion.</p>
            <p n="22">22. To put this matter out of doubt, I would commend theſe following conſiderations to all ſober-minded men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ſcripture ſaith, "Chriſt came to ſeek and to ſave that which wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>oſt."</p>
            <p>But the elect, as elect, were not loſt.</p>
            <p>Therefore Chriſt died not for the elect, as or becauſe they were elect; for that had been to ſeek and ſave what was found and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>d before.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſcripture ſaith, Chriſt died for the unjuſt.</p>
            <p>But the elect, as ſuch, are not unjuſt.</p>
            <p>Therefore, Chriſt died not for the elect, as elect; for that had been to juſtify them who were juſt before.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſcripture ſaith, "He came to preach deliverance to the captives."</p>
            <p>But the elect, as elect, are not captives; for Chriſt ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> ſet them free.</p>
            <p>Therefore he died not for the elect, as elect; for that had been to ſet them at liberty who were at liberty before.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The ſcripture ſaith, "He quickeneth them who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, ſuch as were without Chriſt, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lieus from the common wealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers to the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of promiſe, without hope and without God in the world.</p>
            <p>But the elect, as ſuch, are not dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, but alive unto God. Neither are they without Chriſt; for they are choſen in him; nor are they aliens from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of Iſrael, and ſtrangers to the covenant of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. But they are fellow-citizens with the faints, and the houſhold of God.</p>
            <p>Therefore Chriſt died not for the elect, as or becauſe they were elect. For that had been to quicken them that were alive before, and to bring them into covenant, who were in covenant before. And thus, by theſe means account our Lord loſt his labour of love, and accompliſhed A SOLEMN NOTHING.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Thus having ſhewn the grievous folly of thoſe who ſay, that Chriſt died for none but the elect. I ſhall now prove by undeniable reaſons, that he died for all mankind.</p>

            <list>
               <item>1. If Chriſt died not for all, then unbelief is no ſin in them that finally periſh? ſeeing there is not any thing for thoſe men to believe unto ſalvation, for whom Chriſt died not.</item>
               <item>2. If Chriſt died not for all, then it would be a ſin in the greateſt part of mankind to believe he died for them; ſeeing it would be to believe a lie.</item>
               <item>3. If Chriſt died not for thoſe that are damned, then they are not damned for unbelief. Otherwiſe, you ſay, that they are damned for not believing a lie.</item>
               <item>4. If Chriſt died not for all, then thoſe who obey Chriſt by going and preaching the goſpel to every creature, as glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of grace and peace, of great joy to all people, do ſin thereby, in that they go to moſt people with a lie in their mouth.</item>
               <item>5. If Chriſt died not for all men, then God is not in earneſt in calling all men every where to repent; for what good could repentance do thoſe, for whom Chriſt died not?</item>
               <item>6. If Chriſt died not for all, then why does he ſay he is not willing any ſhould periſh? Surely he is willing, yea, reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that moſt men ſhould periſh; elſe he would have died for them alſo.</item>
               <item>7. How ſhall God judge the world by the man Chriſt Jeſus, if Chriſt did not die for the world? Or how ſhall he judge them according to the goſpel, when there was never any goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel or mercy for them?</item>
            </list>
            <p n="25">25. But, ſay ſome, "If Chriſt died for all, why are not all ſaved!"</p>
            <p>I anſwer, Becauſe they believe not in the name of the only begotten Son of God. Becauſe God called, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:029479_0017_0FE13B88BAB5D8A0"/>to anſwer; he ſtretched out his hand, and they regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not; he counſelled them, but they would none of his counſels; he reproved them, but they ſet at nought all his reproofs; they followed after lying vanities, and forſook their own mercies; they denied the Lord that bought them, and ſo brought upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved, therefore (if you would know wherefore) God gave them up to believe a lie, and to be damned. How often (ſaith our Lord) would I have gathered you together, and ye would not. Ye would not. Here is the plain reaſon, why all men are not ſaved. For God promiſeth no man ſalvation, whether he will or no; but, leaveth them to everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, who will not believe and obey the goſpel.</p>
            <p n="26">26. "O, then you are an Arminian! You are a free-willer, You hold free-will in man!"</p>
            <p>I hold nothing but what the ſcripture ſaith; and that you ſhall give me leave to hold. I do not hold, that any man has any will or power of himſelf to do any thing that is good; but by the grace of God we may do all things. I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhewn, he hath given Chriſt for all men. And he who ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him freely give us all things? And what man knoweth not that if he make uſe of all the will and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er God hath given him, God will double his talent and give him more? If any therefore deſire to have more, let him faithfully improve what he has. Likewiſe what man is he, who doth not know that he is not condemned for not doing what he could not do, but for leaving undone what he could have done if he would. Let any man deny it if he can.</p>
            <p n="27">27. "What, then, may all men be ſaved if they will?</p>
            <p>Before I anſwer this queſtion directly, I ſhall ſhew that thoſe who aſk it, are themſelves compelled to grant as much freedom of will, as we deſire to plead for.</p>
            <p>For 1. The Aſſembly of Divines, in their confeſſion of Faith, c. 9. do expreſsly ſay, God "hath endowed the will of man with that natural liberty that it is neither forced, nor by any abſolute neceſſity determined to do good or evil."— 2. Mr. Baxter, in the preface of his call to the unconverted, ſays, "That Calvin as well as Arminius, held free-will, and that no man of brains denieth, that man hath a will that is naturally free; it is free from violence, it is a ſelf-determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principle." Sure here is as much ſaid for free-will, as any man need to ſay, and perhaps more. For,</p>
            <p>The difference between us, is this. They ſay, "Man hath a will which is naturally free." We ſay, "Man hath this freedom of will, not naturally, but by grace."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:029479_0018_0FE13BB56C8C57B8"/>
We believe, that in the moment Adam fell, he had no freedom of will left; but that God, when of his own free grace he gave the promiſe of a Saviour to him and his poſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, graciouſly reſtored to mankind a liberty and power to accept of proffered ſalvation. And in all this, man's boaſting is excluded; the whole of that which is good in him, even from the firſt moment of his will, being of grace and not of nature. And now we come directly to the queſtion, whether all men may be ſaved if they will?</p>
            <p n="28">28. To thoſe who have conſidered what has been premiſed; I anſwer, 1. What ſhould hinder them, if they be willing? For, 2. God is not willing that any ſhould periſh; yea, 3. He is willing that all men ſhould be ſaved. And Chriſt is willing; for he "came not to judge the world, but to ſave the world." And how did he weep over Jeruſalem! How often would he have gathered them together, even as an hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but they would not? And now that hinders men's ſalvation, but that ſame, <hi>they would not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="29">29. They would not; they will not come at Chriſt's call, and hearken to his reproof, and wait for his counſels, and receive power from on high to live to him who died for them, walking in all his commandments and ordinances blameleſs, and following him whitherſoever he goeth. This way is ſo narrow that few care to walk therein, and therefore they are not ſaved even becauſe <hi>they reject the counſel of God againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</hi> They choſe death; therefore they periſh everlaſtingly.</p>

               <p>Quite the Contrary. St. <hi>Chryſoſtome's</hi> expreſs Words are, Judas, <hi>my Beloved, was at firſt a Child of the Kingdom, and heard it ſaid to him with the Diſciples, "ye ſhall ſit on Twelve Thrones." But afterwards he became a Child of Hell.</hi>
