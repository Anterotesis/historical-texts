            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>An ORATION, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE rise and fall of empires are events, with which the happiness or misery of millions are connected: They constitute the most important objects which can employ the exertions of man, and furnish a dignified subject for his contemplation. To trace the steps, by which the celebrated nations of antiquity, from their first rude beginnings, rose to dignity and empire,—and mark the causes which occasioned their gradual declension and subversion, is a pleasing, instructive, and melancholy employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But it is in a still nearer, and more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teresting point of view, that we are now invited to contemplate the subject. Our own country has lately assumed the rank of Empire; and this day, the most important, perhaps, in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of mankind, is consecrated to commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the event.—No circumstance, which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended this important transaction, is uninterest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or trifling. When the Resolution, for the Declaration of Independence, was first moved in Congress, the magnitude of the object filled every mind, in that august assembly, with ideas too big for utterance. The fate of an extensive empire, and of unborn ages, was now to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided. In fixed contemplation, each appeared to forget his own existence, and stood a living statue: In which expressive attitude, as drawn by the masterly hand of a TRUMBULL, they still seem to remain. After this solemn pause, the motion was ably, and deliberately supported,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:032775_0004_0FF50FAB00447370"/>
against every objection which could be raised, and at length received their unanimous signature.</p>
            <p>Hail, illustrious Patriots! who dared, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of a host of foes, with all their vengeance pointed at your devoted heads,—appealing to the SUPREME JUDGE of the world for the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of your intentions, to declare, <hi>"That these</hi> COLONIES <hi>were, and of right ought to be,</hi> FREE <hi>and</hi> INDEPENDENT STATES;" and, for the support of this declaration, did pledge to each other, <hi>"your Lives, your Fortunes, and your sacred Honour."</hi>—May your names be transmitted to future ages, as examples of forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and heroism, when the <hi>Alexanders</hi> and <hi>Caesars</hi> of mankind shall be buried in oblivion.—Forever sacred be this Anniversary: Let this day be devoted, through all succeeding ages, to commemorate the important events, with which it is connected. Tell the interesting tale to your children, and leave it in charge, that they tell it again to theirs.</p>
            <p>When the bravery of our countrymen had conquered their foes, and our Independence was established, a more important victory was still to be gained,—a victory over ourselves.—When we consider the discordant materials which composed our Empire, and the disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganizing principles, which are the constant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants of all revolutions,—the establishment of our National Government is a matter of the highest astonishment.—This was the greatest triumph of Reason, over the passions of selfish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and ambition, that was ever exhibited by the human race.—To behold an extensive em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032775_0005_0FF50FAC8A09F240"/>
like this, in a time of peace, collected by their Representatives, and uninfluenced by the ambition of individuals among themselves, or the intrigues of foreign nations, calmly delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating upon, and at length exhibiting to view, a form of government, so well adapted to the genius and circumstances of our country,—so well combining energy with liberty,—and after this, to see it adopted by the great body of the people, with scarce a single instance of riot or confusion, must have been a pleasing spectacle to superior Intelligencies.</p>
            <p>Every circumstance, attending the revolution, and the establishment of our government, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives a new importance, when contrasted with the tumult and horrid carnage which has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and still attends, the French revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—O Liberty! how has thy sacred name been perverted!—The mind is disgusted at the sound, and the grating terms of Tyranny and Despotism, are music to the ear, when compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with French Liberty and Equality. In vain has the present age boasted of its refinement, and of the progress of reason;—in vain have we looked forward, with pleasing expectation, for a speedy termination of war, among the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth: The delusive prospects are vanished, and human nature sinks, degraded, into its lowest state of depravity.</p>
            <p>It affords a pleasing source of reflection, that this country has, in so great a degree, escaped the convulsive storm, which has shaken Europe to its centre; and that, in spite of all the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of foes from without, and traitors within,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032775_0006_0FF50FAE17B67710"/>
our Independence, and Government, have been hitherto supported; and we have enjoyed a high degree of national prosperity.</p>
            <p>A further consolation will be afforded to the mind, in contemplating the wretched state of European nations, from the consideration of a superintending Providence; which often, in the most unexpected ways, brings about events, of the highest importance, to the happiness of mankind. But no circumstance of past success, or of present prosperity,—no tokens of Divine interposition in our favour, or ideas of a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intending Providence, can excuse us from a vigilant attention to our duty, as citizens and as men; nor can any of these considerations, prevent a deep anxiety at the storm which threatens us.</p>
            <p>Think not, my countrymen, that you are now at liberty to sit down in indolence, or that the blessings of Liberty, and good Government, are to be preserved without your attention.—Your Independence, your Rights and Liberties, your Government, so highly valued, are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered: An ambitious, unprincipled nation, fired with the rage of universal dominion,—in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated with their victories, and governed by men puffed up with insufferable vanity, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising the highest insult towards our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,—are committing the most wanton spolia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on our commerce, and threatening us with the vengeance of their arms.—An attempt to prove to this audience, the injustice of their complaints, would be an insult to their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing. To add to our danger, a powerful
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032775_0007_0FF50FAFA3D1BD20"/>
Faction, of our own Citizens, are, by misrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation, and all the arts of intrigue, aiding the wicked designs of these domineering Despots. Their disorganizing principles have poisoned the minds of many of our citizens, and corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our councils. Instead of those venerable Fathers, who conducted the Revolution, and whose wisdom and integrity commanded the admiration of the world,—too large a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of inexperienced youth,—of factious dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues, and dupes to foreign influence, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose our present councils.—Hitherto a virtuous majority have saved us from ruin; but, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated instances, the contest has been long and dubious,—and the final success the seeming ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of mere accident.—While our most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant rights are thus threatened, and subjected to the quibbles of faction, it behoves us to prepare the means of defence.—The millenial state, when swords shall be beat to plough-shares, and spears to pruning-hooks, is not yet arrived. A long period of war and bloodshed,—of nation rising against nation, and kingdom against king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, is probably to intervene, before any set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled order of things, or regular system, will be established, that will lay the foundation of a permanent peace among the nations of Europe;—and, whatever may be the success of our present earnest endeavours to preserve the peace of our country, yet, until that event shall take place, we are exposed to the danger of war,—and exposed, in proportion as we neglect the means of defence.—Let our youth be trained to arms, to order and discipline.—War, when considered merely as a field for military achiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, without regard to the justice of the cause
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032775_0008_0FF50FBC62EEAC38"/>
for which it is undertaken, is a disgraceful em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment;—but when it is considered as the means of defending our rights from an unjust invasion, and of transmitting them to posterity, it becomes a noble art; and the soldier who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends these rights, is intitled to the highest pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible gratitude of his country.</p>
            <p>Ye Young Men, the eyes of your country are fixed on you for its means of protection. While you were engaged in your youthful sports, your fathers and friends have bled and conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to secure the rights which you now enjoy, and to establish the Independence, which you this day celebrate. Should this country again be called to defend its Liberties and Independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, a worthy band of experienced veterans, will once more unsheath the sword, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct you in your turn to the field. Prove your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the worthy sons of the conquerors of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Fear not to engage any nation which can be employed against you. Confirm the solemn Resolution of this country, expressed by our Representatives in Congress, at the most gloomy period of our former contest,—that <q>We will never be hewers of wood, or drawers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to any nation under heaven; and are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, with one mind, to die freemen, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than live slaves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The imputation of cowardice is more to be dreaded than death: Should you hesitate to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the Liberties and Independence of your country, when unjustly invaded,—the ghosts of a hundred thousand Americans,—your fathers, your brothers and friends,—whose mangled
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032775_0009_0FF50FBDEB601C58"/>
corses have strewed the ground, from the plains of Abraham to the Eutaw springs,—will rise to haunt you:—Posterity will execrate your mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ories, and the stings of your own consciences will be your perpetual tormentors—Should you, on the other hand (which I have no reason to doubt) prove yourselves, on all occasions, the able defenders of the rights and the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of your country, your names, and your deeds, will be recorded, for the praise and imitation of succeeding ages,—and your own reflections will be a perpetual source of refined satisfaction.</p>
            <p>While our country stands firmly prepared, for any event which may take place, let us not neglect the arts of peace.—Diffuse useful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge among all classes of citizens. Here, tho' young in empire, the United States stand fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most among the nations of the world. This is the firm pillar which supports our Republican Government, and if neglected, it will soon tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in ruins.</p>
            <p>The French nation, furnishes a melancholy example of the dangerous consequences of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing a Republican Government, where the great mass of the people are in a state of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and unacquainted with the rights and duties of citizens. What will be the final event of the experiment in France, I will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to predict; but this may with safety be asserted, that under whatever name a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is administered, so long as the great body of the people continue in ignorance, they are in a state of oppression. They have no will of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032775_0010_0FF50FBF795C24A0"/>
mong us." And, therefore, with propriety, he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so called the SON OF MAN.</p>
            <p>THIS is the glorious, the illustrious character, whom the FATHER hath anointed and set as "KING, upon his holy hill of Zion;" and, as a mediator, has made him also <hi>"head over</hi> ALL THINGS;" all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures being subjected to him.</p>
            <p>This is the KING whom we are to proclaim in our preaching. One clothed with divine authority, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all power in heaven and earth in his hands. And, at the same time, one who is "meek, having salvation." "A just GOD, and yet a Savior."</p>
            <p>But it is necessary farther to observe here, that the character and work of CHRIST, which is the great subject of gospel preaching, comprehends more than merely his <hi>regal</hi> office. In accomplishing the work, for which he came into our world, we are taught, that he sustained a <hi>prophetic</hi> and a <hi>priestly</hi> office, as well as that of a KING. That he was the great <hi>teacher</hi> sent from GOD, to "shew us the Father," and to reveal the only way of acceptance with GOD unto eternal life. That he also "gave his life a <hi>ransom"</hi> for sinners—became "obedient unto death," in the room of guilty men; that he thereby made an atonement, and brought in an everlasting righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, which is the only foundation of a sinner's jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification before GOD. And that, in consequence of this, "whosoever believeth on him, shall receive for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of sins and obtain everlasting life." Which leads us, in the next place,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) To speak of the SUBJECTS of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:032775_0011_0FF50FC1079E8020"/>
It is of peculiar importance, in preaching the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of GOD, that the <hi>marks</hi> and characters of these subjects be clearly defined, according to the only unerring standard, the WORD OF GOD. Here we find, they were once, like the rest of mankind, in a state of awful rebellion against their rightful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign—opposed to his laws, character and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—"children of wrath, by nature"—and would have continued in this state, forever, had not the sovereign, free and boundless grace of their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended KING, interposed, to prevent their ruin, by turning their hearts to himself, and, "in the day of his power, making them his willing people." By this, their <hi>hearts</hi> are won over to an everlasting at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to their KING, and to his cause and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est; so that it has become dearer to them than their own; yea, than all other interests in the universe.</p>
            <p>Indeed, there are many who <hi>profess</hi> to be friends to him, who are <hi>nominally</hi> his subjects, and who cry "LORD, LORD," and yet are real enemies to him, in heart and practice. So there are, often, traitors to be found in every kingdom and commonwealth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, who make pretensions to loyalty and patriotism; while they are opposed, in their hearts, to the government they are under. These traitors are, sometimes, though not always, detected, and meet the just vengeance of the state. So it will be, finally, with all the pretended friends, but real ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, of CHRIST'S KINGDOM.</p>
            <p>His true subjects are essentially distinguished from these, by <hi>this</hi> mark, that they are, in <hi>heart</hi> and

               <hi>life,</hi> as well as in profession, friends to their KING. They have deliberately and cordially chosen him for their SAVIOR and their LORD; and make it the great business of their lives to serve and obey him. And this brings me to observe,</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) That <hi>to preach the kingdom of GOD,</hi> it is of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial importance to proclaim the LAWS and regulations of this kingdom. No community or state can sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist long, with any tolerable degree of order and happiness, without <hi>laws</hi> and <hi>rules,</hi> by which they must be governed. Indeed, there are errors and imperfections to be found in all human governments and laws. But, not so, with respect to those of <hi>this kingdom.</hi> These are all absolutely perfect; calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to promote the greatest happiness of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and of all its subjects; for they are all "holy, just and good."</p>
            <p>It is true, that, according to these laws, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of this kingdom are to be punished with great and awful severity. The threatenings denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst rebellion, are very pointed, and exceedingly terrible. Their language is, "He that believeth not, shall be damned." "Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish." And, "The wrath of GOD is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from heaven, against all ungodliness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness of men." But, terrible as these threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enings are, they are no more than proportioned to the crime against which they are pointed; and will, therefore, be cordially approved of, by all the real friends and subjects of the kingdom, as just and righteous. Indeed, they all flow from infinite wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032775_0013_0FF50FCF2BB94878"/>
and goodness; and are necessary to preserve order in the kingdom, to secure the honor and dignity of the divine government, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the highest interest and happiness of its subjects.</p>
            <p>Thus does it appear, that, in <hi>preaching the kingdom of GOD,</hi> it is of great importance to inculcate the <hi>laws</hi> and <hi>regulations</hi> by which its subjects are to be governed, and to which they all owe a willing obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and subjection. Once more,</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) The peculiar PRIVILEGES, belonging to this kingdom, are, by no means, to be passed over in silence. These are such as become the character of the great Head of the kingdom to confer; and such as might naturally be expected from a being so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, so infinitely wise and benevolent. Free PARDON of all their former rebellion—reception into <hi>his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor</hi> and family—<hi>protection</hi> from their enemies—con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <hi>provision</hi> for their support and comfort—pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar <hi>tokens of his love and care</hi>—divine aids under all their trials here—special <hi>consolation</hi> and support, in the <hi>hour of death</hi>—a final deliverance from all <hi>sin,</hi> and <hi>suffering</hi>—admittance into his <hi>immediate presence,</hi> and to the full enjoyment of <hi>perfect felicity</hi> in his everlasting kingdom hereafter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>These</hi> are the honors and PRIVILEGES, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to, and will be conferred upon, all the loyal and happy subjects of the kingdom of GOD, and which, they who preach it, are bound to proclaim.</p>
            <p>Having thus considered what is implied in the command in the text, we proceed, briefly, to show, as was proposed,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:032775_0014_0FF50FD0B6353A50"/>
II. TO WHOM this command is given, <hi>"Go thou and preach the kingdom of GOD."</hi> To this important question, the inspired oracles afford a full, clear and ready answer. The wisdom of GOD has not left this point involved in such uncertainty, as to make it impossible, or even difficult, to ascertain it. It is an object of too great importance, to be left to the wisdom or to the will and humor of men. The KING of Zion has clearly pointed out the character and qualifications of those, whom he sends upon this important business. And they are described by the following marks.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> MEN OF KNOWLEDGE. For ignorance, especially of the great system of doctrines in divine Revelation, and those other branches of science, which are necessary to enable the preacher to explain, rightly divide and defend those doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, totally disqualifies a person for this work. A <hi>Novice, i. e.</hi> one rude, ignorant and unlearned, is expressly forbidden to enter upon the work of preaching the gospel. It is an arduous employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and requires a great deal of labor and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the head, heart and hands, to discharge it with fidelity. Close and diligent application to reading, meditation and prayer; above all, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant and prayerful attention to, and study of the holy Scriptures; for it is from this source that "the man of God is to be thoroughly furnished for his work."</p>
            <p>Nor is it sufficient that he be possessed of a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinal, or merely speculative knowledge of divine
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032775_0015_0FF50FD244724288"/>
truths; he must have an EXPERIMENTAL acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with them; having felt the power and efficacy of them upon his own soul, as well as experienced the consolations of the gospel. There certainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be something more than an absurdity in a person's being employed to promote the honor and interest of a kingdom or society, who is, at heart, <hi>an enemy,</hi> and utterly opposed to that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. What must naturally be expected as the consequence, in this case; but that he will, when opportunity presents, act agreeably to his real char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter, and betray its dearest interests into the hands of its enemies? No proposition, surely, can be more rational, no truth more important, than this, that they who <hi>preach the kingdom of GOD,</hi> ought to be firm and cordial friends to this kingdom, and to prefer its interest "above their chief joy."</p>
            <p>ANOTHER mark by which the gospel preacher is described, is, a READINESS AND FACILITY OF COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MUNICATION. It is expressly required, that they be <hi>"apt to teach."</hi> A man may be possessed of a good understanding, of many acquired accomplishments, and of undoubted piety and goodness; and yet be wholly deficient in this point; not having a facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of communicating what he does know, with that perspicuity and ease, which are necessary to render him a useful preacher, and "a workman that need not be ashamed."</p>
            <p>TO THESE, must be added, an EVIDENT CALL OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE, by such concurring circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, as clearly show it to be the will of CHRIST,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032775_0016_0FF50FDDDD18BB00"/>
that the person qualified, should enter upon this work. Such as <hi>harmony,</hi> and a good degree if not an entire unanimity, among the people with whom he is called to labor; a prospect of a <hi>reasonable</hi> and <hi>comfortable support</hi> among them; and such appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, in other respects, as render it hopeful, that he may prove a useful Minister in his day, and not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor in vain, or spend his strength for nought.—But we pass to the IMPROVEMENT of the subject; which would naturally suggest a great variety of remarks. A few of them, only, will be just hinted at; and we shall close with those re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, which are more immediately pertinent to the present occasion.</p>
            <p>The subject leads us to reflect, what cause of thankfulness have we, that the <hi>kingdom of GOD,</hi> which is a kingdom of <hi>grace,</hi> has been erected in this fallen world! No such blessing was ever indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the apostate angels. Upon their rebellion, they were doomed to endless woe, without hope of relief. But to fallen <hi>man,</hi> GOD has proclaimed a free pardon to all those, who shall repent, submit, and return to their allegiance.</p>
            <p>How sad, then, is the reflection, that there should be so many among mankind, who turn a deaf ear to these gracious offers from their offended Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign; and obstinately refuse a cordial subjection to him, and how righteously might such be left of GOD to receive the punishment so justly due to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:032775_0017_0FF50FDF687ECA70"/>
But, amidst all the ingratitude, infidelity and wickedness, that prevail at this day, in the gospel world, our subject still affords a joyful prospect, to all the benevolent friends of Zion, of the future great increase and advancement of <hi>this kingdom,</hi> in the latter day glory; and the present aspect of prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence, compared with the word of GOD, gives no small ground to believe, that period is fast ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching; when universal peace and love shall reign on earth; when wars shall cease, and "all shall know the LORD, from the greatest to the least."</p>
            <p>How earnest should christians be in prayer, and what great encouragement have they, to "continue instant" in it, for this happy event.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the preceding subject affords a just and scriptural criterion, by which to determine who is the faithful <hi>Preacher of the kingdom of GOD.</hi> He is one, who has a cordial friendship, a supreme love to JESUS CHRIST, the great Head of this kingdom.</p>
            <p>He will, therefore, endeavor clearly to explain and hold up to view, his true character, as set forth in the word of GOD; as the brightness of the FATHER'S glory and the express image of his person. "As Imman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel, GOD with us:" To whom are ascribed divine hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors; and who, of right, claims divine prerogatives; which consideration alone could give such dignity to his character and work, as to render him capable of making a sufficient atonement for sin, and bringing in everlasting righteousness.</p>
            <p>He will, also, with great earnestness, preach and inculcate upon his hearers, the LAWS of Christ's
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:032775_0018_0FF50FE0F70AAAF0"/>
kingdom; and that a uniform, conscientious obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to them, is the only evidence of real love to CHRIST and his kingdom. On which ground, he will "affirm constantly, that they who <hi>believe,</hi> be careful to maintain <hi>good works."</hi> And that, "by their <hi>fruits</hi> we are to know" who are, and who are not, the friends of <hi>GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is seasonable, further, to remark, that our sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject presents the most powerful motives to ministeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al faithfulness, that can be conceived of. The hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of the great GOD—the precious cause and interest of our divine REDEEMER—our own peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort—and the everlasting salvation of our fellow sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, are all, most intimately, concerned in our fidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity in this work. How frequently, then, my <hi>breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren,</hi> should we examine our views and conduct, and call ourselves to an account, how we have discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our duty; whether we have preached the pure, unadulterated gospel of JESUS CHRIST; not tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing, to please the corrupt humors of men; but boldly and faithfully declaring the whole counsel of GOD, that we may be "pure from the blood of all men!"</p>
            <p>But, on this solemn occasion, how must the mind of our <hi>younger brother</hi> be impressed with the most serious concern, who is, this day, to be separated to the great and important work of <hi>preaching the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of GOD!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the view, SIR, of the vast importance of this work, as it stands connected with everlasting conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, to yourself and your hearers; and under a
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032775_0019_0FF50FE293E31468"/>
sense of your own weakness and inability, is not your heart ready to tremble at the prospect before you; and to exclaim, in the language of the apostle, <hi>"Who is sufficient for these things?"</hi> The work indeed is great and arduous; and the responsibility, which is attached to it, is, in a peculiar manner, a consideration, which adds amazing weight to the employment; as you are to "watch for souls, as one who must give an account." You will naturally reflect upon that solemn passage in the word of GOD, which declares, that if any souls should finally perish, through the watchman's neglect or unfaithfulness, <hi>their blood will be required at the watchman's hand.</hi> But be not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, <hi>brother.</hi> Your work is with the LORD. If you are faithful in his service, and make it the great aim of your ministerial labors to win souls to CHRIST, and to advance his kingdom in the world; though you should not have the happiness to be so successful as you may desire; yet, you will be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, even "though Israel should not be gathered;" and will be "a sweet favor to GOD, both in them that perish, and in them that are saved."</p>
            <p>Hear, then, the voice of your Master, saying to you, this day, <hi>"Go thou and preach the kingdom of GOD;"</hi> and, for your encouragement, hear him also saying, if you are obedient to his command, "LO, I AM WITH YOU ALWAY, EVEN TO THE END." If you have <hi>his</hi> presence, you have enough. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, also, that, "without HIM, you can do noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:032775_0020_0FF50FEF9A6DBF40"/>
We wish you a divine blessing in this great un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; and that you may be a wise, and success<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful laborer in the vineyard of our LORD; be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in turning many to righteousness, and, atlast, shine as a distinguished star forever, in the kingdom of GOD.</p>
            <p>THE FLOCK OF CHRIST, in this place, we cordial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly congratulate, upon this occasion. We rejoice with them, that after the late frown of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in the sorrowful removal of their late beloved pastor by death, whose labors they enjoyed for so very short a season; that the great Head of the Church has disposed their hearts to unite in the choice of another, who, we sincerely hope, will be made a rich and lasting blessing to them and their children. Receive him, <hi>brethren,</hi> in the LORD; and esteem him highly in love, for his work's sake. Encourage his heart, and strengthen his hands, by a diligent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on his administrations; and by all those acts of kindness and love, which are justly required and expected from your mutual relation to each other. Above all, "brethren, pray for him," that he may be taught of GOD, that so he may be able to teach you. That he may win many souls among you to JESUS CHRIST; and may he who sows, and they who reap, at last meet together, and rejoice for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in the kingdom of GOD.</p>
            <p>To conclude. The foregoing subject, and the thoughts which have been suggested by it, may, with great propriety, be applied to this numerous and solemn assembly; and ought to excite very serious,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032775_0021_0FF50FF1242098A0"/>
but different sensations, according to the differing characters in it.</p>
            <p>We have, all of us, been educated in a land of gospel privileges, and ordinances; we have had the <hi>kingdom of GOD preached</hi> to us; and have been earnestly invited to become subjects of it. What the effect has been, GOD knoweth; and will shortly call us to a strict and solemn account. By nature, we have all been in a state of rebellion against the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious King of the universe, and refused to have him to reign over us. Has the rebellion and opposition of our hearts ever been subdued? We have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited, yea, entreated, to be reconciled to GOD; to come into, and partake of the rich and everlasting blessings of his kingdom; and we are still the subjects of these gracious calls. If we have obeyed them, and have complied with the offers of mercy, happy are we indeed; happy in the favor and protection of our KING and SAVIOR, while in this world; and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after we shall see his face in peace, and shall live and reign with him forever in glory.</p>
            <p>But if, notwithstanding all the means of grace and the peculiar advantages we have enjoyed, any of us continue rebels to GOD, and refuse subjection to JESUS CHRIST as our SAVIOR and LORD; awful, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and unspeakably hazardous, is our situation, It will be more tolerable for the heathen, in the day of judgment, than for us. It becomes all such, therefore, to realize their true and sorrowful condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; immediately to renounce their rebellion, and fly to the mercy seat, while it is <hi>"an accepted time,</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:032775_0022_0FF50FF2B1216098"/>
and a <hi>day of salvation."</hi> Otherwise, the KINGDOM OF GOD, will, in a very short time, be preached no more to them; and their justly offended KING, will rise up in anger, and shut the door of mercy forever against them. Wherefore, "let us hear his gracious voice, today, and not harden our hearts."</p>

            <head>THE CHARGE, GIVEN BY THE REV. MR. WHITNEY, OF NORTHBOROUGH.</head>
            <p>WE, the Presbytery, hereunto called in the providence of GOD, and in virtue of authority de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Founder of Christianity, having sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emnly separated and ordained you, Mr. WARD COTTON, (by prayer and the laying on of our hands) to the work of the Gospel Ministry, in general, with authority to preach the word, and administer the ordinances of GOD, <hi>whenever</hi> and <hi>wherever</hi> you shall be regularly invited thereto; do, now, declare you to be the special Bishop and Overseer of the first Christian Church and Society in Boylston.</p>
            <p>As you are set apart to this sacred employment, let me stir up your pure mind, by way of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the duties of your high and holy calling.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, I, who am an elder, (as thou also now art,) exhort you, before GOD, and the LORD JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JUS CHRIST, (who shall judge the quick and the dead
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032775_0024_0FF50FFF5B716FB8"/>
at his second appearing in the glory of the Father,) that you take heed to the ministry you have received in the LORD, to fulfil it.</p>
            <p>Take heed, therefore, unto yourself, and unto all the flock, of which the HOLY GHOST hath made you an overseer, to feed the Church of CHRIST, which he has purchased with his own blood. You will consider this flock as your peculiar charge; to their service you will, then, devote your time, and every talent the GOD of nature or grace has bestowed upon you. While this people support you, "necessity is laid upon you, and wo be unto you, if you preach not the gospel."</p>
            <p>Preach the word; GOD'S word; not as many, who corrupt it with human inventions, mixtures, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
            <p>"Take heed unto your doctrine," what you teach and preach, Feed this flock with the sincere milk of the word, that they may grow thereby, up to the measure of the stature of the fulness of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>The holy scriptures are committed to you as a <hi>sac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red depositum:</hi> These you are to open and explain; and teach or preach nothing but what is clearly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein, or may be fairly and evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced therefrom. As an ambassador from the Prince of Peace, your instructions are all laid before you in the Bible. "All scripture is given by inspiration of GOD, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness; that the <hi>man of GOD,</hi> the Christian Minister, may be perfect, throughly furnished unto all good works."
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032775_0025_0FF51000E51A7960"/>
The Bible, then, you will make your chief study, that you may rightly understand that, and preach it faithfully to your hearers; not following cunningly devised fables, which, as an <hi>ignisfatuus,</hi> only mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead. You are set for the defence of the gospel, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all who would oppose or corrupt it. In this age of infidelity, when some, professing themselves wise, become fools, and employ their wit, not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, to decry the wisdom of GOD, it is particularly important, <hi>that,</hi> from a thorough examination of all the evidences of Christianity, you endeavor to be well grounded, rooted, and settled in the faith; whereby you will be the better able to confirm and establish the faith of others; and by clear reasoning to convince gainsayers, and to put to silence the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of foolish men.</p>
            <p>I shall not take upon me to tell you <hi>what</hi> to preach in particular. I claim not <hi>infallibility,</hi> nor any dominion over your faith. I know not any right I have, authoritatively to enjoin on you to teach and preach according to my <hi>Creed,</hi> or agreeable to my system of divinity. It is your right, nay more, as you will answer it to GOD, it is your duty, to examine and think for yourself, and to preach what, after painful and prayerful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, appears to you to be the truth as it is in JESUS, "calling no man Master upon earth. One is your Master, even CHRIST. And to your own Master you must stand or fall." In the sermons of our LORD, and of his Apostles, you have eminent patterns of gospel preaching.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:032775_0026_0FF510026F81F8D8"/>
You will frequently advert to that solemn appeal, which St. Paul made to men, respecting the <hi>matter</hi> and the <hi>manner</hi> of his preaching, and his fidelity in the discharge of the duties of his sacred embassy; and, in imitation of so bright an example, "keep back nothing which may be profitable to your hearers, nor shun to declare the whole counsel of God; testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying, to all, repentance towards GOD, and faith to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our LORD JESUS CHRIST. And suffer none of the trials you meet with to move you, neither count your life dear unto yourself, so that you may finish your course with joy, and the ministry you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the LORD JESUS, to testify the gospel of the grace of GOD." Study to shew yourself approved unto GOD, a workman who needeth not to be asham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, rightly dividing the word of truth; and, as a faithful and wise steward in the house of GOD, give to every one his portion of meat in due season; feeding the lambs, as well as the sheep of the flock; not assuming dominion over their faith, but striv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be a helper of their joy. Be instant in season, and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all authority, and with all long suffering and doctrine; teaching every man, and warning every man, that, if possible, you may present every man perfect in CHRIST JESUS.</p>
            <p>You will urge mankind to a seasonable and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent use of the means of grace; but, cautious of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing the salvation of man to outward means, sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and knowing that, in bringing sinners to final happiness, you are a laborer together with GOD, you
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:032775_0027_0FF51003F8F2FEA8"/>
will never cease to pray for this people, that the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ergy of GOD'S HOLY SPIRIT may ever accompany all your sacred ministrations; and render them effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al means of convincing and converting sinners; and of building them up in holiness and comfort, through faith, unto salvation; pressing it upon them to be working out their own salvation, with fear and <hi>trembling,</hi> while GOD, by the efficacious influences of his SPIRIT, is working in them, to will and to do of his own good pleasure.</p>
            <p>"Take heed," also, unto the <hi>manner</hi> of your preaching. Having your mind deeply impressed with the sense and weight of eternal concerns; and feeling a joint personal interest in the great truths you preach to others, you will speak as becomes the oracles of GOD; not with those theatrical airs and gestures, which, however they may befit a school<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy, or a youth just completing his academical stud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies, by no means become the sacred desk, nor him who is speaking, in the name of GOD, to sinful men: But with that gravity and solemnity, that earnestness and pathos, which the reference of these things to men's final state will generate and inspire. And never attempt to supply the want of matter, by the mere graces of composition, or to court the tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry applause of the ignorant, instead of the lasting approbation of the deserving.</p>
            <p>"Take heed unto yourself," as well as to your doctrine and manner of preaching. Endeavor to make yourself master of your business. Stir up the gifts you are possessed of. Give attendance to read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032775_0028_0FF5100EB6A551A0"/>
meditation and prayer, that your advances in ministerial furniture may appear to all. "Take heed unto yourself," to the state and welfare of your own soul, lest, after having preached to others, you should be a castaway.</p>
            <p>"Take heed unto yourself," how you live and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have in the world. Give no offence in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed. Be wise as a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and harmless as a dove. Let no man despise you; but, by dignity and propriety of conduct, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify your office; and be thou an example to all, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity; in all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works.</p>
            <p>As you are brought near to GOD, to do the service of the temple of the LORD, and to stand before the Congregation to minister unto them, see that you give no occasion to the enemies of the LORD to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme; but let "holiness to the LORD," be written on all your services, and on all your enjoyments.</p>
            <p>Take heed how you behave, with respect to your Fathers and Brethren in the Ministry.</p>
            <p>You will avoid that lust of Diotrephical preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, which some hanker after; and while you wish to be seen and known, among your brethren, according to your age and rank, and according to your station in the church of GOD, you will, as a modest, (a sure sign of a sensible) man, shun those forward, assuming, dictatorial airs, which by no means become the face of youth in the presence of age. Be not found smiting your fellow servants;
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:032775_0029_0FF51010464BE870"/>
neither play the bishop in other men's parishes; nor listen to the disaffected therein, from a sordid thirst for popularity, or that you may rise upon the ruins of others, lest you should have occasion to say, "As I have done, so GOD hath requited me."</p>
            <p>Administer the ordinances of CHRIST'S appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the proper subjects thereof; making a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the clean and the unclean. Yet never impose unscriptural terms, for christian communion, upon any. Make not the door of admission into CHRIST'S church narrower than he has made it. He, who well knew what was in man, admitted a Judas into his first little church. You will strive to keep up the discipline appointed by CHRIST in his house. Prefer not one before another. Do nothing by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality.</p>
            <p>The powers of ordination belong to you. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, therefore, you are called to separate persons to this work, make a proper use of your power, for the glory of GOD, the interest of religion, the credit and reputation of the Clergy, and the peace, order and unity of the Churches. Lay hands, suddenly, on no man; neither be partaker of other men's sins.</p>
            <p>Introduce not a novice into the ministry, lest, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elated with pride, he fall into the comdemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the devil. It is not every fellow who thrusts himself into the pulpit, who is fit for the ministry. You are bound to judge of <hi>their</hi> qualifications, who are called by a people, and offer themselves to this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. The things, therefore, which you have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of us, before all these witnesses, the same com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032775_0030_0FF50F938CBEA648"/>
you to <hi>faithful</hi> men, who shall be <hi>able</hi> to teach others also; men of good abilities, fair moral char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters, and blameless lives.</p>
            <p>In a word; endure afflictions as a good soldier of JESUS CHRIST; for these, if your life is spared, you must expect to meet with. "The servant is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove his master; neither he who is sent, above him who sent him."</p>
            <p>Finally; remember you watch for souls, as one who must give an account. You are this day enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on your labors. How soon you may be called to give account of your stewardship, is known only to him who sends you forth to labor. You will bear in mind the short course allotted to that worthy young man, your immediate predecessor; and let it be a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento to you, to "work the works of him, who sends you into his vineyard, while it is day; the night cometh when no man can work." And, now, we say to you, dear Sir, if you keep this commandment, unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukable, and are found faithfully discharging the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of your office, whether your term be long or short, and though this Israel be not all gathered, as you could wish; yet you shall be glorious in the eyes of the LORD; and when the Chief Shepherd shall appear, you shall receive, from his hands, a crown of life, which shall never fade away. So help you, GOD.</p>

            <head>THE RIGHT HAND OF FELLOWSHIP, BY THE REV. AARON BANCROFT, OF WORCESTER.</head>
            <p>CHRISTIANITY is the consummation of divine goodness. The spirit of the gospel is love and candor: Its general tendency is to rectify every dissocial affection in its disciples; to refine the human character, and to promote the happiness of man through all his relations. Peace on earth and good will to men were proclaimed by the celestial Harbingers of the birth of its Divine Author. But the nature of the gospel has often been misunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, and its benevolent intentions have been pervert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The professed disciples of JESUS CHRIST have often exercised tyranny over the consciences of their fellow beings, and supported their usurpations by every act of cruelty. Where the power of persecution has been denied—blind attachment to system—zeal for points of doubtful speculation, have often stifled the amiable principles of our religion, and excited passionate disputes and inveterate parties among Christians. The intemperate cry for Paul, Cephas
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:032775_0032_0FF5101DE116C788"/>
and Apollos, has taken the place of love, candor and meekness. From these errors, we may all take lessons of moderation.</p>
            <p>Our civil government makes no distinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween different denominations of Christians. It is for us, individually, to carry into full effect the charitable spirit of our religion. We cannot suppose, that GOD has suspended the rewards of immortality upon those conditions, on which the genius of superstition makes them to depend; ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract speculations and ceremonial rites. Piety and virtue may, doubtless, subsist, amidst a variety of opinions and a diversity of forms. We ought not to require that, at a <hi>term of communion,</hi> which GOD does not require as a <hi>condition of salvation.</hi> The scriptures are an infallible rule to all christians; but the wisest and the best of men may err in its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication: Our charity therefore may be extended to all, who consistently support the christian charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. In this way, we shall promote unity of spirit in the bond of peace.</p>
            <p>Under these impressions, Dear Sir, in the name and by the appointment of the Council present, I give you the Right Hand of Fellowship. We acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge you our equal; possessed of all the privileges of a Christian Bishop. We presume not to exercise dominion over your faith; but we wish to be the helpers of your joy. By this sacred pledge, we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low your right of private judgment, and promise a corresponding practice. We proffer you our friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in the walks of private life, and our advice and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:032775_0033_0FF5101F71D58D98"/>
assistance in the business of your probation. In every suitable way, we engage to cooperate with you, in the promotion of a kingdom of righteousness, peace and joy. From you, we expect the like of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of friendship, advice and assistance.</p>
            <p>GOD ALMIGHTY bless thee, my Brother. May he grant clearness to thine understanding and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to thy studies; may he add length to thy life and lustre to thine example; success to thy ministe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial labors, and to thy fidelity the crown of glory.</p>
            <p>The Christian Church and Society in this place will accept our congratulation on the events of this day. With you we have noticed the dispensations of Providence, in the repeated and quick removal of your ministers: With you we mourned the early death of your late Pastor. We applaud your spirited exertions in support of the public institutions of the gospel: We rejoice at the unanimity and order which have attended the choice and induction of your present Minister. He relies on your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, your candor and support. We are persuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you will, by a serious attendance on his minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, encourage his heart, and strengthen his hands. Your own salvation, and the happiness of your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, urge this duty upon you. The state of society with us, renders the attention to the public worship and instruction of the Sabbath highly important. The increasing wealth of our country opens daily new channels of luxury and dissipation. Arguments of general scepticism are placed before the public in their most engaging forms. Every seducing specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:032775_0034_0FF510210670D1A8"/>
finds an emission from the press. The friends of mankind must wish to counteract this excess of liberty, by useful information and religious impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions; by habits of sober reflection and good prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. No methods can be conceived better calculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to impress the unexperienced mind with a sense of moral obligation, to enforce the laws of religion on conscience, and to furnish armor of defence against the seductions of a wicked world, than the public institutions of Christianity. By the regular attendance of yourselves and your families at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of DEITY may you expect, that energy will be given to your private instruction and example. Your Minister will rise up and make a good report of you; your children, and call you blessed.</p>
            <p>May the GOD of peace and love delight to dwell with and to bless you.</p>
            <p>When JESUS shall a second time appear, may you, your Pastor, and all to whom he shall minister, with HIM, enter into the joys of Heaven.</p>
