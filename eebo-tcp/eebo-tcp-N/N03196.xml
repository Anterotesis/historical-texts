            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S there is no Salvation but in Jeſus Chriſt, nor any other Name under Heaven given among Men, whereby they muſt be Saved, ſo it muſt needs be the greateſt Mercy to Mankind to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy that Goſpel which reveals this Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, &amp; the Way to Eternal Life by him. And as thoſe who are thus highly favoured, ſhould with all thankfulneſs acknowledge this Sovereign Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of divine Grace, in revealing theſe things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, ſo they ought, and if they have the true Spirit of Chriſt and his Goſpel, will pity thoſe of their Fellow Creatures who are deſtitute of the Means of Light, and are periſhing for lack of Viſion.</p>
            <p>And it is juſt matter of Lamentation to think that when we are ſo remarkably Bleſſed with the Light and Grace of the Goſpel, there ſhould be ſo many Tribes and Nations of the <hi>Aborigines</hi> of this Land, within or juſt upon our Borders, who do ſtill walk in Heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eniſh Darkneſs, and dwell in the Region of the Shadow of Death, with little or no Light ſpringing up unto them, unleſs what ſome of them have by the <hi>Romiſh Miſſionaries,</hi> which Light is but Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>And it is doubtleſs to our Reproach, as betraying a want of that Gratitude to Chriſt, and Love and Charity to Mankind, which his Grace teaches, that there has been no more done by US for the Propagation of the Goſpel among them. Eſpecially when we conſider how much we have been outdone by the <hi>French,</hi> and thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in this Matter. For how ſhall we anſwer it, that when they have been at ſo much Coſt
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:003867_0004_100206FA1AC86A30"/>
and Pains for Propagating their Superſtition, we have been at ſo little for the promoting that Religion of Jeſus, which before God and the Father is pure &amp; undefiled.</p>
            <p>But <hi>how ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how ſhall they hear without a Preacher? and how ſhall they Preach except they be ſent?</hi> To which I may add, How ſhall they be ſent unleſs God ſends them? For Men qualified for this Service are as it were with one Conſent making their Excuſe. And it is God alone that can incline the Hearts of any to engage in ſuch a difficult and Self-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying Service. And whenever any Perſons are inſpired with ſo much Zeal for the Honour and Intereſt of Chriſt, tender Pity and fervent Charity to thoſe uncivilized as well as ungoſpelized People, as to live among them and Preach the Goſpel to them, God muſt have the Glory of it.</p>
            <p>And ſuch an One we truſt Mr. <hi>Sargent</hi> is, who notwithſtanding the agreeable Buſineſs he was in as a Tutor of <hi>Yale-College,</hi> and his having as fair a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect as any Candidate for the Miniſtry whatſoever, to have an agreeable Settlement in any of the Churches that ſhould need a Paſtor; yet voluntarily devoted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Service of Chriſt and of the poor <hi>Indians;</hi> and more eſpecially thoſe that are at or near <hi>Houſſatonnoc.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now with reſpect to <hi>this Tribe</hi> of Indians, their Number, Scituation, and other Circumſtances relating to them; and particularly the Manner how they came firſt to be diſpoſed to receive the Goſpel, and how Mr. <hi>Sargent</hi> as a Miniſter, and Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> as a School Maſter, were introduced among them, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by them, and the hopeful Proſpects there are of the Goſpel's ſpreading and prevailing in thoſe dark and ignorant Parts of the Land, will beſt appear in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Narrative hereof given by the Rev. Mr. <hi>Stephen Williams</hi> of <hi>Springfield,</hi> in a Letter of <hi>June 24 1735.</hi> to a Gentleman then in <hi>Boſton,</hi> which for the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the Reader, is here inſerted, and is as follows. viz.</p>

                     <salute>Worthy Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>THE Concern you ſeemed to have on your Mind, for the Welfare of the <hi>Aboriginal</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of this Country (when I laſt ſaw you at <hi>Boſton</hi>) is the Occaſion, of my troubling of you with ſome Account of the good Diſpoſition there is in the River Indians (as they are called) to receive the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And here before I proceed, it is needful to inform you, that this Clan of Indians (whoſe Prince or Chief Sagamore was the late <hi>Etouocoam,</hi> one of the Indian Kings that went to <hi>England</hi> in <hi>Queen Ann's</hi> Reign) live upon <hi>Hudſon's River,</hi> below <hi>Albany</hi>; and their Bounds extends Eaſt, ſo as to reach to <hi>Houſſatonnoc</hi> (which is the South-Weſt part of our Government) and to a Place called <hi>Weteoge</hi> (that is the North-Weſt of <hi>Connecticut</hi> Government) ſo that thay live in the three Governments. They are the moſt nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Tribe of Indians that I am acquainted with. They can raiſe (I am told) three or four hundred Men. But having thus informed you, I proceed to tell you, that there live ſeveral Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of theſe Indians at <hi>Houſſatonnoc</hi>; amongſt whom there are two Indians of note, the one is named <hi>Cuncaupot,</hi> the other <hi>Umpecheny. Cuncaupot</hi> has been honoured by Governor BELCHER with a Captain's Commiſſion, and <hi>Umpecheny</hi> with a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant's. When they received their Commiſſions (which was at <hi>Springfield,</hi> in <hi>May</hi> 1734) I made them a Viſit, and found them grave, deſirable, prudent Men; the Captain then 42 Years of Age, the Lieutenant 38. In Converſation with them, I found that Capt <hi>Cuncaupot</hi> was apprehenſive that the Religion of his Fore-fathers was not right. But yet he did not know how to think well of the Chriſtian Religion, becauſe the Chriſtians (many of them) lead immoral Lives I improved the ſhort time I had with them, in diſcourſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:003867_0006_10020700A0EECD28"/>
Religion, and removing their Objections, and asked them when I left them, whether they ſhould be willing to ſee me at their own Country? They ſaid they ſhould, and would go home and tell their People what had been ſaid by me, and the Rev. Mr. <hi>Hopkins,</hi> who was with me part of the time of converſing with them. I informed his Excellency Governor BELCHER, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable and Reverend Commiſſioners of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Affairs, of this matter, who encouraged and directed my going up to ſee them. And in <hi>July</hi> 1734, I went up to their Country, accompanied with the Reverend Mr. <hi>Bull</hi> of <hi>Weſtfield.</hi> Capt. <hi>Cuncaupot,</hi> and his Kinſman Lieut <hi>Umpecheny,</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted great Joy at ſeeing us. They gathered their People together the next Day, after we got to <hi>Houſſatonnoc,</hi> with whom we diſcourſed about Religious Matters. They told us they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what had been ſaid, and give us an Anſwer in four Days; the moſt of which time was ſpent in conſulting together, conſidering and weighing what had been ſaid to them. When we met them again, I preached a ſhort Sermon to them, which was interpreted Sentence by Sentence. They gave good Attention to what was ſaid. After the Exerciſe was over, all that were preſent (which was the <hi>Houſſatonnoc</hi> Families) gave in their Names to us, with their deſire that ſome Body might be ſent to inſtruct and teach them the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: Upon which I gave them a Belt of Wam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pum, which they received as a Pledge, that I would do their Meſſage to the Governour, &amp;c. It would be too tedious, to give you an Account how they managed themſelves in their Debates on what was offered to them; and what Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (we underſtood) were urged for or againſt receiving the Chriſtian Religion. But I can't omit informing you, we were told, that an Indian (whoſe Name is <hi>Ebenezer,</hi> and who has ſince made
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:003867_0007_1002663182508B68"/>
a Profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion, and received Baptiſm) offered thus to his Countrymen, viz. <hi>The Indians</hi> (ſays he) <hi>continue ſtill in their Heatheniſm, notwithſtanding the Goſpel has been bro't ſo near them, and they are greatly diminiſhed; ſo that</hi> (ſays he) <hi>ſince my remembrance, there were Ten Indians, where there is now One: But the Chriſtians greatly increaſe and multiply, and ſpread over the Land; let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leave our former Courſes and become Chriſtians,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Soon after my return home I went to <hi>Boſton,</hi> and waited upon His Excellency and the Honourable Commiſſioners; who were ſo ſatisfied with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given them, that they deſired the Rev. Mr. <hi>Bull</hi> and me, to look out ſome ſuitable Perſon, to be employ'd as a Miſſionary, among that People. We undertook the Affair; and Divine Providence led us to the learned, pious &amp; ingenious Mr. <hi>John Sargent,</hi> one of the Tutors of <hi>Yale College,</hi> whom God had inclined to ſuch a ſelf-denying, difficult Service. He went up to <hi>Houſſatonnoc</hi> in <hi>Octob.</hi> 1734, accompanied by the Rev. Mr. <hi>Bull,</hi> to introduce him. When Mr. <hi>Sargent</hi> arrived at <hi>Houſſatonnoc,</hi> the Indians immediately ſet up a School-houſe, and a conſiderable number of them began to learn their Primers. Mr. <hi>Sargent</hi> (who is one of the moſt ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Perſons for ſuch buſineſs, that I know of) was very agreable to the Indians, got a great intereſt in their Affections, ſo that the Captain &amp; Lieutenant each of them, ſent a Son with him to <hi>New-Haven,</hi> tho' at an Hundred Miles diſtance, to live with him the Winter Seaſon (for Mr <hi>Sargent</hi> returned to Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege to take care of the Senior Claſs). When Mr. <hi>Sargent</hi> came away, Mr. <hi>Timothy Woodbridge</hi> went up to keep the School, who ſpent the Winter with them, who has done very good Service in bringing them on in their Reading, and in inſtructing them Principles of the Chriſtian Religion. He taught them the Catechiſm of Dr. <hi>Watts.</hi>

                     <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:003867_0008_10026634057314A0"/>In the Winter paſt, the whole Nation of the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Indians met by their Delegates at <hi>Houſſatonnoc</hi> to examine what the <hi>Houſſatonnoc</hi> Indians were do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Capt. <hi>Cuncaupot,</hi> and Lieut. <hi>Umpecheny</hi> were fearful they ſhould be frowned upon, and have Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections caſt in their way, which they ſhould not be able to remove, and therefore ſent to ſome of the Miniſters deſiring they would come up. The Rev. Mr. <hi>Hopkins</hi> and I went up in the middle of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſee them. There were aſſembled together One hundred and fifty or Two hundred Perſons, Young &amp; Old; and among them <hi>Corlair,</hi> the chief Sachem of the whole Nation. I preached two Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to them on the Sabbath. It was one of the graveſt, and moſt attentive Auditories that ever I preached to. We had divers Conferences with the Indians, and read to them a Letter from the Hon. <hi>John Stoddard,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and endeavoured to anſwer their Objections, &amp;c. And ſo far ſatisfied thoſe that came from other Places, that they thanked us for the pains we had taken; and deſired Mr. <hi>Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> might continue among them, and that Mr. <hi>Sargent</hi> would return to them, and ſaid they would give an account to their ſeveral Towns, of what we had offered to them, yea gave us Encouragement that they would as a Nation ſubmit to Inſtruction. Soon after we left them, a pleuretick Fever ſeized ſeveral of them, and two of them died with it: When they were Sick, they deſired Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> the School-maſter to pray with &amp; for them. And thoſe that died (before their Death) deſired they might be buried in the Chriſtian Burying-place, and after the Engliſh manner: And according to their deſire, they were; and without the Indian How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and Lamentations and Ceremonies.</p>
                  <p>Sometime in <hi>February</hi> laſt, they ſent a Letter to the Miniſters that had viſited them, which was dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by them, tho' written by an Engliſhman: in it they have theſe Expreſſions, <hi>We do humbly thank
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:003867_0009_1002663798DBA5C0"/>
you for your care and kindneſs towards us in inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us in the Chriſtian Religion; which we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be the beſt Religion in the World; and the Religion which we intend to ſtand by &amp; follow as long as we live: Altho' there are a great many difficulties in the way, yet we have no thought of giving out,</hi> &amp;c. This was ſigned by <hi>Cuncaupot, Umpecheny,</hi> and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others. In the Spring Mr. <hi>Sargent</hi> returned to them again, and was received by them with a great deal of Joy. And he writes to me thus, viz. <hi>I find</hi> (I think) <hi>a better Diſpoſition in the Indians here, towards Chriſtianity, than I left them in. The Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, many of them, have made conſiderable Progreſs in their Learning: And the Number of them is increaſed to near Forty. There is Buſineſs enough for two Men,</hi> &amp;c. Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> in a Letter tells me, that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Indians from other Plantations have come, and joined to them.</p>
                  <p>Thus I have given you a ſhort and imperfect Account of an Affair, that I have been ſomething concerned in; and which has coſt me, with the other Miniſters, ſome hundreds of Miles travel. I have been ſolicitous for the Welfare of the poor Heathen, ever ſince I was a Priſoner with them, and have with Concern obſerved the little proſpect there has been of bringing any of them to receive the Proteſtant Religion, by our Miſſionaries at the Forts, where the Indians make but ſhort ſtays, and are either drunk or buſy about their Trade, all the while they tarry. And the Indians that frequent our Truck-Houſes, are generally ſuch as are poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the Jeſuits, who have a great aſcendant over them; as the Rev. Mr. <hi>Seccombe</hi> obſerves, in a Letter I have ſeen of his. But I can't but think, there is a hopeful proſpect of much Good being done to theſe River Indians, if prudent Meaſures are purſued: For they are well diſpoſed to receive the Chriſtian Religion; have never been poiſoned by the Jeſuits (for their Scituation is ſuch, that the
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:003867_0010_1002070328B92FA8"/>
Jeſuits can't come among them, without paſſing by <hi>Albany</hi>) There are among them ſeveral Perſons of good Morals, remarkable for their Truth, Juſtice, yea and Temperance (tho' Intemperance is the Indians National Vice). They have an Affection for the Engliſh, eſpecially for thoſe who take pains to Inſtruct them. Their Children are deſirous to learn to Read, &amp;c—Are very mannerly ſince they have been at School. I don't know what a Fund the Commiſſioners have to ſupport their Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but Mr. <hi>Sargent</hi> and Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> ſeem very willing to ſpend and be ſpent in this good Work, if they can be ſubſiſted ſo as to be enabled to go on with it. Mr. <hi>Sargent</hi> in his laſt Letter to me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes himſelf thus, <hi>I hope the Commiſſioners will ſupport Mr.</hi> Woodbridge <hi>and me here, ſo as that we can attend upon the Buſineſs without Diſtraction; for I hope we ſhall find a Door continually open to ſerve God and Mankind to ſome good Effect.</hi> And I am ſatisfied that the honourable the Commiſſioners will be willing, if they have a Fund ſufficient to do it, and to anſwer their other neceſſary Charges at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,</hi> &amp;c. But I can't but hope (if the Fund is not ſufficient) that God will raiſe up Friends, &amp; increaſe the Stock, ſince ſuch a wide, and (I hope) <hi>effectual Door is opened,</hi> and God has led to ſo ſuitable a Perſon as the worthy Mr. <hi>Sargent,</hi> who has told me, he ſhould chooſe to ſerve his Redeemer in ſuch Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, if there was a proſpect of Succeſs, rather than any other Way. The difficulty of the Service, the hardſhip he muſt undergo, dwelling in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and out of the Way of his learned Acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, don't diſhearten and diſcourage him. He is a Gentleman of ſuch Parts and Learning, and ſo remarkable for his Piety, that any of our deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Churches would be fond of him, but he will not allow any of them, to think of diverting him from the good Work he is engaged in.</p>

                  <p>Though I am not ſo happy as to have much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Acquaintance with you, yet your known Character in general, and eſpecially your Relation to the Affair I have been ingaged in, has made me hope, I ſhall have your Pardon for the Trouble I now give you.</p>
                  <p>'Tis but lately that I have returned from <hi>Houſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnoc</hi>; and I doubt not but you will rejoyce to be informed of the happy Succeſs, God has been pleaſed to bleſs the Endeavours with, that have been uſed to convert the Heathen there to the Chriſtian Faith. The Deſign has hitherto ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond Expectation. They are I think now reſolved to be Chriſtians, and have an earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to be taught. The fondneſs they ſhew for me is ſurpriſing; and conſidering how much a Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:003867_0012_10020708A64B0A20"/>
I am to them, their own barbarous Education, and how little I have done to win them, there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſomething more than humane in it.</p>
                  <p>I am very willing (if the Gentlemen Commiſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners pleaſe) to devote my Life to the Service of their Souls. If God give ſucceſs in it, it will be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſatisfaction to me.— There is now, and I hope will be Work enough for two: I wiſh therefore Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> may be maintained there with me.</p>
                  <p>I am ſenſible that <hi>One Hundred Pounds</hi> will but juſt pay the neceſſary Charges of living: for the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of Life, are and muſt be dear in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote part of the Country. But I make my ſelf eaſy in that matter, aſſuring my ſelf, that (if there be Money) the Gentlemen betruſted with that affair, will do what is reaſonable. Money alone is no temptation to me at all, to devote my ſelf to ſuch a Life, yet 'tis but reaſonable, I think, to expect to be ſupported, ſo as to have no other care, than to attend the buſineſs I ſhall go about.</p>
                  <p>Some of the <hi>Indians</hi> (I perceive) have a mind to be baptized: <hi>Cuncaupot</hi> eſpecially, who appears to me, to be well qualified for it. I have therefore tho't it would be convenient I ſhould be Ordained ſpeedily; at leſt as ſoon as I am diſmiſſed from the concerns of College. I would gladly be informed, whether it wilt be expected I ſhould come to <hi>Boſton</hi> for that purpoſe. To be Ordained here will be more convenient for me, and leſs expenſive.</p>
                  <p>The Lads I brought down with me, lived here laſt Winter upon my Credit. The Charges have amounted to ſomething conſiderable; too much for me, under my preſent Circumſtances, to bear alone; tho' were I able, I ſhould gladly beſtow my Money that way.—</p>
                  <p>If you will be pleaſed to return a Line in anſwer to theſe, I ſhall eſteem it a great honour, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour done to</p>

                  <p>MR. <hi>Woodbridge,</hi> Indian School-maſter at <hi>Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatonnoc,</hi> upon ſome neceſſary buſineſs, left his School, a few days, and has been with us. And the account he gave is ſo encouraging, that I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it will be grateful to you, and therefore ſend it.</p>
                  <p>He informs me that ſeveral of the <hi>Houſſatonnoc</hi> Indians have lately been to the Weſtward as far as <hi>Siſcohannah,</hi> which they ſay is ſix Hundred Miles, and upon their return they ſay, that the Indians, thro' that large ſpace, are generally diſſatisfied with their own ways of Religion; and are diſpoſed to inquire after ſome other way of Salvation, than ever they have been acquainted with.</p>
                  <p>He informs me further, that the River Indians (of which thoſe at <hi>Houſſatonnoc</hi> are a part) fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently viſit their Brethren at <hi>Houſſatonnoc,</hi> take great notice of what is doing there; none of them oppoſe it, they generally approve of it: and many of them expreſs their deſigns of coming to ſettle there; and ſome have put ſuch a deſign in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion already, and are upon the ſpot: So that the number of Scholars, now actually under Inſtruction is upwards of Forty. And he adds, that he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, if the Indians could be accommodated with a proper quantity of Land, there would, in a little time, be a Congregation of ſeveral Hundreds of them worſhiping GOD there.</p>
                  <p>That the Indians at <hi>Houſſatonnoc</hi> continue in a fixed reſolution to ſeek after knowledge in the Chriſtian Religion, and to live in the practice of it; and have made great proficiency for the time.</p>
                  <p>That Capt. <hi>Cuncaupot</hi> ſeems to be overjoy'd to ſee the good diſpoſition there is in his Brethren, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Chriſtian Religion. Religion ſeems evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to be next his Heart: And he, with ſome others of them, deſire to be baptized. —</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="xii" facs="unknown:003867_0014_1002663E47E74CD8"/>That Lieut. <hi>Umpecheny</hi>'s Wife and others, have wept more than once, upon heating divine Truths: And ſhe eſpecially has her Heart very much upon this Affair. She is alſo greatly engaged in learning to read: She will not fail of reading as often as any Scholar; and urges that ſhe may read a little further, and a little further; ſo that Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> tells me, it grieves him to the very Heart, that he is obliged almoſt to force her from him, that he may have time to hear the reſt of the Scholars. Other Women there are alſo, who diſcover much of the ſame good diſpoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> the Captain's Wiſe, the Lieutenant's Wife's Siſter, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>He further informs me, that there came an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, a little while ago, from <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s River, named <hi>Nompeh,</hi> about Thirty Years old, a Man of very ſingular Gravity, and began to learn to Read; he knew his Letters when he came, and that was all: He applied himſelf to the buſineſs with the utmoſt attention, and has made great progreſs &amp;c.—</p>
                  <p>Theſe things give us reaſon to hope that the Hand of GOD is in, and his bleſſing upon that Affair. That it may ſucceed to the ſaving benefit of thoſe poor Indians, is the ardent deſire of</p>

            <p>Such a general inclination &amp; deſire as appears in theſe Indians to be Inſtructed in the things of God, and to be taught to Read, in order to their coming at a fuller know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe things, is ſo uncommon &amp; extraordinary, that there ſeems plainly to be the finger of God in it. And the Honourable Commiſſioners who have the diſpoſal of the Monies, annually ſent over, for the propagating the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel among the Indians, have been ſo far pleaſed with theſe Accounts, that they have readily done what they thought proper, for the encouraging and ſupporting both Mr. <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent</hi> and Mr. <hi>Woodbridge</hi> in their reſpective Services.</p>

               <pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:003867_0015_1002070A99BD2068"/>And as it was tho't highly proper, according to Mr. <hi>Sargent's</hi> propoſal, that he ſhould be Ordained; ſo His Excellency the <hi>GOVERNOUR,</hi> who is at the Head of the Commiſſioners, was pleaſed ſo to order the matter, as to have a very favourable Opportunity for it. For His <hi>Excellency</hi> having propoſed a Treaty at <hi>Deerfield</hi> with ſome of the Indian Tribes, he gave orders to the Indians at <hi>Houſſatonnoc</hi> to meet him there; accordingly the <hi>Governour,</hi> attended with a large Committee of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable His Majeſty's Council, and Houſe of Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives, and many other Gentlemen, was at <hi>Deerfield</hi> on <hi>Auguſt 25;</hi> And that Week being taken up in the Treaty with the Indians, in ratifying the Peace &amp; Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip between us and them; and in giving and receiving the uſual Pledges of it; and Mr. <hi>Sargent</hi> not coming to Town till the Friday Evening, it was judged proper to have the Ordination on the Lord's Day, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly carried on in the forenoon of the ſaid Day, by the Reverend Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Hatfield,</hi> and the other Miniſters then preſent, at the deſire, and in the preſence of His <hi>Excellency,</hi> and the honourable Gentlemen of the General Court, and others that attended him thither, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Aſſembly of Chriſtians uſually meeting in that Place, and many of the Indians who were grave Spectators of the Solemnity, and the <hi>Houſſatonnoc In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> who ſat by themſelves, and attended throughout the whole Service with great Seriouſneſs; and were much pleaſed to ſee One whom they had ſuch a love for, ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ſeparated to the Service of their Souls.</p>
            <p>The Service was carried on in the following order, <hi>viz.</hi> the Reverend Mr. <hi>Aſhley</hi> of <hi>Deerfield</hi> began with Prayer: and as by the Governour's Invitation, I waited on him in his Journey, ſo by His Excellency's Order I preached the Sermon, which by His authority and Influence is here made publick: The <hi>Charge</hi> was given by the Reverend Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Hatfield</hi>: and the <hi>Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Elders</hi> by the Reverend Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Springfield:</hi> and the Exerciſe concluded with a Song of
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:003867_0016_1002663FCA762190"/>
Praiſe: and the ſolemn Benediction of the People in the Name of the Lord, by the Reverend Mr. <hi>Sargent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now; May this Servant of the Lord prove a choſen Veſſel to bear Chriſt's Name among the Heathen, for many Years to come! May his Life and Health be precious in the ſight of God! May he be filled with Wiſdom and Grace from Him in whom it has pleaſed the Father that all fulneſs ſhould dwell; and come laden to them with the Treaſures of a Glorious Goſpel! And may he, with his beloved <hi>Companion in the Service and Patience of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> be inſtrumental of ſpreading the ſaving knowledge of God and Chriſt, both far and near, among thoſe that have for ſo many Ages been in ignorance! And as the Harveſt ſhall increaſe, may the Lord of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt thruſt forth more and more Labourers into it! May the Funds for the ſupport and encouragement of ſuch be enlarged; and may all ſuch as generouſly contribute to ſuch a noble deſign, receive an hundred fold in this World, and in the World to come life everlaſting!</p>
            <p>Finally; May the <hi>SON OF GOD</hi> more fully than ever, take the Heathen for his Inheritance, and the utmoſt Ends of the Earth for his Poſſeſſion! And may there be of every Kindred and Tongue and People &amp; Nation, ſhout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth the Praiſes of the Redeemer!

            <p>And now ſuch erroneous doctrines, and ſuch falſe teachers, the apoſtle exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> to ſhun &amp; avoid, if he would be a good miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt. But upon it obſerves, That it was no great wonder, if there were ſome ſuch hereticks and falſe teachers in the church; for it was no more than we ſhould meet with in any great houſe, veſſels, or utenſils of different kinds, ſome to honour and ſome to diſhonour; as in the verſe preceeding my text: <hi>In a great houſe</hi> (ſays he) <hi>there are not only veſſels of gold, and of ſilver, but alſo of wood, and of earth; and ſome to honour, and ſome to diſhonour.</hi> And then comes in the words of my text, <hi>If a man therefore purge himſelf from theſe</hi>; (that is from theſe hereticks &amp; falſe teachers; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially from their errors and corruptions that he ſpake of in the 16<hi>th</hi> &amp; 17<hi>th</hi> verſes; or any other falſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and corrupt practices that would ſubvert the fundamental doctrines of chriſtianity,) <hi>he ſhall be a veſſel unto honour, ſanctified and meet for the maſter's uſe, and prepared unto every good work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the apoſtle carries on the metaphor he had begun in the foregoing verſes; repreſenting the church of God under the ſimilitude of a great houſe, and Chriſt as the maſter of it; and the members, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the miniſters of the goſpel, as veſſels in it; which if they would be veſſels unto honour, ſanctified and fitted for the maſter's uſe, and prepared to every good work, muſt be throughly purged and cleanſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:003867_0019_100266444AD46A48"/>It muſt needs be a deſireable thing to be veſſels unto honour, to be imployed in the high and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſervices of that great houſe, which is the church of the living God. And they are veſſels unto honour indeed, who are not only ſanctified, ſet apart and conſecrated to that holy ſervice, but are alſo fitted for the maſter's uſe, even prepared, qualified and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to every good work that he ſhall ſet them about. But now in order to this, a man muſt be purged and cleanſed: <hi>if a man purge himſelf from theſe he ſhall be a veſſel unto honour, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This may ſuffice to introduce the ſcheme of my preſent diſcourſe: And as for a fuller explication of the words, it ſhall be under the ſeveral obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which I ſhall be obliged to ſpeak very briefly to.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Obſ. The church of God is as it were a great houſe, of which Chriſt is the head and maſter.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Obſ. Miniſters are as veſſels and inſtruments for the uſe and ſervice of this houſe.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Obſ. Some of theſe are unto honour, and ſome unto diſhonour.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Obſ. The veſſels unto honour, are ſuch as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſanctified and ſet apart, are fitted for the maſter's uſe, even prepared unto every good work.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Obſ. In order to their being ſuch veſſels unto honour, they muſt be purged &amp; freed from many things.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Obſ. <hi>The church of God is as it were a great houſe, of which Chriſt is the head and maſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The apoſtle makes a compariſon between the church and a houſe, in the foregoing verſe, and carries on the metaphor in my text, ſpeaking of the veſſels and the maſter of the horſe. And it is not unuſual for the Holy Ghoſt to repreſent the church of Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſimilitude. Sometimes the church is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a building it ſelf. Thus (ſays the apoſtle to the church of Corinth) <hi>Ye are God's building,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.9. And particular ſaints are called lively ſtones, that make up the building, 1 Pet. 2 5. <hi>Ye alſo as lively ſtones, are built up a ſpiritual houſe.</hi> And ſo the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003867_0020_1002071833F1E9A0"/>
happy union of chriſtians in the principles and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of faith and holineſs, love and charity, is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as the ſeveral parts of a building that are fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great exactneſs, ſo as to come together every piece to its proper place. Eph. 2.21. <hi>In whom all the building fitly framed together, groweth into an holy temple in the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then at other times the church, when it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented under the metaphor of an houſe, intends not the building it ſelf, but thoſe that live in, and belong to the houſe; even the family or houſhold. Thus we read of the houſe of <hi>Cloe,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.11. of the houſe of <hi>Oneſiphorus,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.16. which intend thoſe that belong to the houſe, even the <hi>houſhold.</hi> And thus the church is called the <hi>houſhold</hi> of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19. and the <hi>houſhold</hi> of faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. So that we may indifferently conſider the church of Chriſt either as the houſe it ſelf, or as the houſhold, even thoſe that make up the family of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And conſidering the church as an houſe in one ſenſe or other, Chriſt is the owner, head and maſter of it. Heb. 3.6. <hi>But Chriſt as a ſon over his own houſe, whoſe houſe are we,</hi> that is we chriſtians, <hi>if we hold faſt the confidence and the rejoycing of the hope firm unto the end.</hi> So that the church of Chriſt is his houſe: He is the maſter, the owner and the governour of it. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to him by all imaginable right whatſoever.</p>
            <p>This ſpiritual houſe, the church of God, is Chriſt's by gift; for it is made up of thoſe whom the father hath given unto him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.2.</p>
            <p>They are alſo his by purchaſe; for the church of God is what he has purchaſed with his own blood, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28.</p>
            <p>They are his alſo by conqueſt; for it is by his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power and grace that they are reſcued out of the hands of their ſpiritual enemies, bro't out of the kingdom of ſatan into the kingdom of the Son of God.</p>
            <p>And then laſtly; He is the owner &amp; maſter hereof by free compact and agreement; for every one that
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003867_0021_100207324DFF38B0"/>
comes in to make a part of this ſpiritual houſe, or to be one of the houſhold of faith, freely ſurrenders up himſelf to him, as to his prince and ruler, as well as ſaviour. They publickly own and profeſs him for their lord and maſter, and promiſe obedience to his commands.</p>
            <p>So accordingly Chriſt acts as the head &amp; maſter of this great houſhold. He looks upon them as his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar care and charge, and gives his orders, directions and commands to them, even all the laws, ſtatutes and ordinances of the Goſpel. He ſets them their ſervice, and gives every one his work to do. And then as a good houſholder he makes proviſion for his church; not only for their bodily, but for their ſpiritual ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and comfort. He takes care that they be fed with the bread of life. They eat and drink at his table, and are cloathed with his righteouſneſs, as well as fed by his grace, and he takes care that every one has his portion in due ſeaſon.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Obſ. <hi>The Miniſters of the Goſpel may be and are conſidered as veſſels or inſtruments in this houſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay veſſels or inſtruments, becauſe the word uſed in my text for veſſels, ſignifies alſo any inſtrument, as Criticks obſerve; eſpecially any inſtruments or uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſils of a family, as well as thoſe excavated ones that do more ſtrictly go under the name of veſſels.</p>
            <p>The miniſters of Chriſt are ſet forth under various characters, and their office repreſented by very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent metaphors; ſome importing the honour, others the labour, and others the uſefulneſs of their office. They are repreſented ſometimes as <hi>angels,</hi> Rev. 1.20. ſometimes as <hi>ſtars, Rev.</hi> 2.1. ſometimes as <hi>embaſſadors</hi> for Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. ſometimes as <hi>meſſengers</hi> of the Lord of hoſts. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.7. ſometimes <hi>ſtewards</hi> of the myſteries of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. ſometimes <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers</hi> of the flock or family of Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.28. ſometimes as <hi>labourers</hi> in the harveſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.38. ſometimes as <hi>watchmen,</hi> and at other times as <hi>ſervants:</hi> And in our text they are repreſented only as <hi>veſſels</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:003867_0022_10026647AE34C7F8"/>
or <hi>utenſils</hi> in the houſe, for the convenience and ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vice of the houſhold.</p>
            <p>And this is not the only place where miniſters are repreſented under this humbling metaphor: For thus ſays the apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. We have this treaſure in <hi>earthen veſſels,</hi> (that is the treaſure of the goſpel,) that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us. And the apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> might well make uſe of this metaphor, becauſe the Lord himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares of him in particular, that he was a <hi>choſen veſſel</hi> unto him to bear his name before the gentiles, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.15. So that miniſters may be looked upon, and ought, in order to keep themſelves humble, to look upon themſelves but as veſſels in the houſe: And they may well be looked upon as ſuch; for they are but as veſſels or inſtruments that the great maſter of the houſhold makes uſe of, for the benefit of his church.</p>
            <p>They are veſſels as they are of God's forming and not of their own; and all formed and faſhioned as he pleaſes; ſome of larger and ſome of ſmaller ſize and capacity, juſt as ſeems good in his ſight, and will beſt anſwer the ſeveral uſes they are to be put to in his church.</p>
            <p>Moreover, they are veſſels, as whatever is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in them is not their own, but what they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive: If they are filled with knowledge and wiſdom, with gifts and graces, it is not from themſelves any more than any empty veſſel can fill itſelf. A veſſel is capable of receiving, and that is all that can be ſaid of us; for what have we that we did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive? 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 4.7. All miniſterial accompliſhments are given to miniſters: <hi>Every good gift, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the father of lights,</hi> Jam 1 17.</p>
            <p>Again, they are veſſels as they not only are made to receive and contain, but alſo to pour out again, to convey and diſpenſe to others. This is the uſe of veſſels, not only to receive and contain, but to pour out again as there is occaſion. Thus mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003867_0023_100266492FE5B030"/>
have the treaſures of the goſpel committed to them, and are filled with gifts and graces, that they might convey &amp; diſpenſe the ſame to others. Their buſineſs is to deliver as well as receive. <hi>I delivered unto you that which I received of the Lord,</hi> ſays the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, 1 Cor 11.23. <hi>Paul</hi> was a choſen veſſel to bear Chriſt's name, and to convey his goſpel, and the way to ſalvation by him to the Gentiles. And this is the buſineſs of every choſen veſſel, to convey the knowledge of Chriſt, to diſpenſe his goſpel, and his ordinances unto the people, according as they have received them; every one according to his capacity, and the meaſure he has received.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, miniſters are veſſels as they are of no uſe, nor are they imployed any farther than Chriſt, the great houſholder, ſees cauſe to make uſe of them. The veſſels or inſtruments of a houſe can make no uſe of themſelves, nor are they of uſe any further than the maſter of the family ſees cauſe to occupy and improve them: ſo miniſters are ſerviceable in the church no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than Chriſt ſees cauſe to improve them in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and ſome he makes more uſe of, than others; and the more ſervice he puts them to, the more honour he confers upon them.</p>
            <p>Again, they are veſſels as they are only the means and inſtruments of any real ſaving benefit flowing to the church by them. They are not the efficient cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but only the inſtruments of the converſion of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. They can't beget faith in any, nor beſtow ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace upon them, but are only inſtruments in God's hands, by which God works ſuch a gracious change in them. <hi>Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters by whom ye believed?</hi> 1 Cor. 3.5</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Miniſters are veſſels as they like other veſſels are liable to be broken, or in time to decay &amp; wear away. No veſſel, let it be made of gold or ſilver, of braſs or iron, and much more of wood or ſtone, but what <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> cuſualty or other is broken to piece, or by <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:003867_0024_1002071DB466B410"/>
ſervice. And this is the caſe with the choiceſt veſſels that God has among his miniſters: if they are ſuffered to continue, yet according to the common courſe of nature, in a few years they wear out, diſſolve to duſt, and are laid aſide in the place of ſilence and inactivity. But how much more common is it for them by ſome violent diſtemper, or ſome ſudden ſtroke of the divine hand, to be daſhed in pieces like a potter's veſſel before that time?</p>
            <p n="3">III. Obſ. <hi>Among the miniſters of the Goſpel ſome are veſſels unto honour, and ſome unto diſhonour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As in a great houſe there are not only veſſels of gold and of ſilver, but alſo of wood and of earth, and ſome to honour and ſome to diſhonour, ſo it is in the church of Chriſt, with reſpect unto the miniſters of it.</p>
            <p>Here let me ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Some are veſſels unto honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some there are that for the exquiſite frame &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of their natures, the brightneſs of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parts, their improvements by education, and above all for their refinements by divine grace, may well be compared to veſſels of gold and of ſilver, exceeding precious and valuable, as well as uſeful &amp; ſerviceable.</p>
            <p>And theſe veſſels, theſe miniſters are unto honour,—</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Unto the honour of Chriſt the maſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Veſſels of gold and ſilver in a houſe are to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the maſter of the houſe, as they ſet forth his rich eſtate: ſo theſe veſſels of gold and ſilver in the church of Chriſt are unto His honour, as they ſerve to ſet forth the riches and the glory of Chriſt. Such miniſters by their doctrines and by their lives do much to diſplay the honour of Chriſt: They ſet forth the glory of his perſon, the glory of his offices as our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, the glory of his wiſdom, of his power, and eſpecially of his grace in the redemption of ſinners. Hence the apoſtle ſays of ſuch golden veſſels, 2 Cor. 8.23. They are the <hi>glory of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 <hi>They are unto the honour of the holy religion they receive, and diſpenſe to others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:003867_0025_1002664AC3C87D98"/>A ſilver or a golden veſſel ſerves to recommend the liquor or whatever is contained therein, eſpecially if otherwiſe it be good in its nature and kind. And nothing tends more to do a proper bottom to religion, and recommend it to the eſteem, the choice, the love and practice of a People, than its being brought to them in ſuch golden veſſels, that is, able miniſters of the new teſtament, who are not only able by acceptable words to ſet forth the excellency of it, but alſo recommend it by their own example. Such miniſters by their ſhining gifts and graces reflect a very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing luſtre upon religion, and adorn the doctrine of God their Saviour in all things.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>They are veſſels unto honour, as they are ſuch on whom God will confer ſpecial marks of honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Veſſels of gold and ſilver are unto honour, as the maſter and owner of them puts honour upon them, by taking particular care of them that they be not loſt or abuſed, and by providing more honourable ſhelves and cloſets for them in the houſe. Thus God ſets a great value upon thoſe miniſters that are as veſſels of gold and ſilver; he has a higher eſteem of them, and ſets his love more upon them, and delights to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour them. <hi>Them that honour me I will honour,</hi> ſays God, 1 Sam. 2.30. He will put marks of honour upon them whilſt they live, and afterwards he will crown them with glory and honour. Now he will cauſe them to ſhine like bright veſſels of gold and ſilver, but then he will cauſe them to ſhine as the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the firmament, and as the ſtars for ever &amp; ever.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Among the miniſters of the goſpel, ſome are veſſels unto diſhonour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this great houſe of the church there are veſſels of wood and of earth; men of a courſe and a heavy mold, of inferior powers and ſmall abilities, dull life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſouls, without any vigour or activity, uncultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and unrefined, groſs &amp; ignorant in their thoughts and apprehenſion of things, fit only for the mean and ordinary buſineſs of life, and no way ſuitable for the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003867_0026_1002664E32BF5540"/>
high and honourable ſervices of the ſanctuary.</p>
            <p>But by veſſels of earth and of wood we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand men of earthly ſouls, men whoſe ſouls cleave unto the duſt, and that mind earthly things, that are carnal, earthly and ſenſual, having their affections ingroſſed by the world, and the things of ſenſe, filled with ſome filthy luſt or other, which hinders them from receiving, much more from conveying any thing that is of a ſublime &amp; ſpiritual nature, and ſo utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for, and indiſpoſed to the holy and ſpiritual ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the sanctuary.</p>
            <p>And now theſe are veſſels unto diſhonour; theſe are a diſhonour to Chriſt, a diſhonour to the faithful miniſters of Chriſt, a diſcredit to the church and to themſelves: or if they ſhould paſs without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable diſgrace here, yet depend upon it, they will be covered with ſhame &amp; everlaſting contempt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Obſ. <hi>Veſſels unto honour are ſuch as being sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and ſet apart, are fited for the maſter's uſe, even pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared unto every good work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is the character or account that the apoſtle gives of a good faithful miniſter, a veſſel unto honour; that he is ſanctified, ſeparated and ſet apart to that ſervice; and not only ſo, but fit for the maſter's uſe, and that is to be prepared unto every good work. So that a miniſter who is a veſſel unto honour is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. One that is ſanctified, conſecrated and ſet apart to that office.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He is alſo one that is fit for the maſter's uſe.</p>
            <p>And this</p>
            <p n="3">3. Is to be prepared unto every good work.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>A miniſter that is a veſſel unto honour is one that is ſanctified, conſecrated or ſet apart for that holy office.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A veſſel unto honour <hi>ſanctified.</hi>— A veſſel that is unto honour muſt be ſanctified. This doubtleſs has reference to the veſſels of the altar and tabernacle, that were all to be ſanctified before they were made uſe of for the ſervice of the ſanctuary, <hi>Exod.</hi> 30.29, 44.
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003867_0027_10026650AAF72928"/>
were ſanctified as they were ſet apart purely for that uſe, ſeparate from all common &amp; ordinary uſes.</p>
            <p>So the Prieſts and Levites of old were ſet apart and ſanctified to the holy ſervices of the altar and taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle. And a great deal of ceremony and ſolemnity was uſed in the conſecrating the prieſts, and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to their holy office. And altho' theſe bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome ceremonies of conſecration under the law are aboliſhed; yet even now miniſters of the goſpel are to be ſanctified, and ſet apart to their holy office, and in ſolemn manner introduced into that ſacred function. They are to be <hi>ſeparated</hi> unto the Goſpel of God, as the apoſtle ſays he was, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.1. which was agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the direction of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.2. <hi>Separate</hi> me Barnabas and Saul for the work where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto I have called them.</p>
            <p>And now the manner they took for the ſeparation of them was faſting, &amp; prayer, and laying their hands on them, as in the following verſe. Accordingly this became an apoſtolical practice to ſanctify or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate to the miniſterial office, by faſting &amp; prayer, and laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a ſolemn charge in the name of the Lord Jeſus, that they take heed to their miniſtry, that they fulfil it. So that the ſolemn ordination of miniſters is their ſanctification or conſecration or ſeparation to the ſacred office of the miniſtry: It is the regular intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and ſolemn inveſtiture of them in their office. So that every one that is thus ſolemnly ordained may be ſaid to be a veſſel ſanctified or conſecrated.</p>
            <p>But then this external ſanctification ſuppoſes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is internal and real. It ſignifies that God approves of them; that he ſets them apart, and owns them for his miniſters. And then that they ſeparate themſelves to that office, and devote and give up themſelves to that ſervice; that they ſeparate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the other buſineſs of life, and give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves wholly to theſe things.</p>
            <p>And now one whom the Lord approves, and does

thus ſincerely give himſelf up to the ſervice of Chriſt in the goſpel miniſtry, and is ſolemnly ſeparated by faſting and prayer, and the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery, he is a veſſel ſanctified to all intents and purpoſes under the goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2">2 But if he would be a veſſel unto honour, he muſt not only be ſanctified; <hi>but fit or meet for the maſter's uſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not ſufficient to be ſanctified and ſeparated, unleſs we are fit for the uſe and ſervice we are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated unto. What will it ſignify to be ordained and inducted into that holy office of the miniſtry, and yet not fit for the uſe; not capable of anſwering the ends and deſigns of it? Therefore if ſuch would be veſſels to honour, they muſt be meet for the maſter's uſe. The veſſels of the ſanctuary that were conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated, were made fit for their ſeveral uſes deſigned for them; ſo muſt miniſters be fit for the uſe which Chriſt the maſter has for us, if we would be veſſels unto honour. The word tranſlated <hi>fit</hi> is in <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Tim. 4.11. Phil. 11.</note> other places profitable; it ſignifies very profitable; it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies that they muſt be very profitable for the maſter's uſe, that would be veſſels of honour. They muſt be in all reſpects fit for the ſervice of Chriſt. They muſt have that knowledge, that wiſdom, and that grace that is neceſſary to make them fit for Chriſt to imploy, and to render them capable of performing the ſervice he calls them unto. The maſter's uſe of miniſters, or the buſineſs that he has occaſion to uſe or imploy them in, is to bear his name, to make him known to the people, and the way to ſalvation by him, as it is laid down in the goſpel. Their buſineſs is to ſhew men the way to Salvation; to turn men from darkneſs to light, and from the power of ſatan unto God. And now miniſters muſt be fit for this uſe and buſineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:003867_0029_100266522DD11488"/>They muſt have that knowledge of God &amp; Chriſt, and ſuch an acquaintance with the holy Scriptures, and with the doctrines and duties contained therein, as will make them able miniſters of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And muſt have that principle of love and obedience reigning in their ſouls, as will prompt and put them upon the faithful diſcharge of the truſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in them, and of anſwering all the good ends and purpoſes of their office. Without this it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible we ſhould be fit for the maſter's uſe. For how can a man anſwer the end of enlightening and inſtructing others that is ignorant and in the dark himſelf? And what is there that will put a man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the faithful diſcharge of the miniſterial office, but a principle of love and obedience to Chriſt? But with ſuch a principle, the man will be fit for the maſter's uſe; for ſuch a principle reigning in the ſoul, will carry the man forth to every kind of ſervice that the maſter ſhall call him to. And this leads me to ſay</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That they are even prepared unto every good work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This explains the former head; for to be fit for the maſter's uſe, is to be prepared to every good work. For what is the uſe the maſter has for his miniſters? Why, it is for every good work; ſometimes one good work, and ſometimes another: And he that is not prepared unto every good work, is not entirely fitted for the maſter's uſe.</p>
            <p>Sometimes the maſter has occaſion to uſe us, in ſuch a work, and ſometimes another; and therefore the miniſter muſt be prepared for every good work. But now what a vaſt variety of work is there in the miniſterial office, that the maſter does conſtantly, or may occaſionally call us unto? There is the daily work and buſineſs of the ſtudy; giving our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance to reading, meditation and prayer, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing diſcourſes for the publick inſtruction of the flock. And then there are the miniſtrations of God's houſe, ſuch as being the mouth of the people in offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their prayers and praiſes to God, and bringing the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003867_0030_10026654AA942580"/>
oracles of God opened and applyed to them: The adminiſtration of the ſacraments, and the conſures of the church; viſiting the ſick; hearing the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and diſtreſſes that one and another may be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under; clearing up their doubts, removing their ignorance, leading them out of their errors, ſcattering their fears, taking away their ſcruples, and leading them in the paths of righteouſneſs and peace.</p>
            <p>And beſides theſe ordinary and common ſervices of the miniſter, there are other ſervices of a more difficult nature, that he may be called unto. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times there are dreadful diviſions and contentions to be healed. Sometimes there are groſs and danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous errors to be refuted, and the truths of the goſpel to be ſupported and defended. Sometimes groſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders to be reformed, &amp; growing wickedneſs couragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and ſtedfaſtly to be oppoſed. And to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no more, ſometimes they may be called, not only to bear teſtimony to the truth; but to ſeal it with their blood. Theſe are ſome of the uſes, that the maſter may have occaſion to put theſe veſſels of the ſanctuary unto: And if they would be veſſels unto honour, and fit for the maſter's uſe, they muſt be prepared for theſe, and every other good work.</p>
            <p>Queſt. But now, <hi>What is it to be prepared unto every good work?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Their being qualified and capacitated for it.</p>
            <p>And then</p>
            <p n="2">2. Their being conſtantly inclined and diſpoſed to any and every good work, the maſter ſhall at any time ſet them about.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>To be prepared for every good work, ſuppoſes our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing qualified and accompliſhed for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It ſuppoſes that we have thoſe natural capacities, and thoſe acquired accompliſhments, as are in ſome proportion to the uſe and ſervice the maſter calls us unto The word in the original is obſerved by Dr. <hi>Preſton,</hi> to have a reference to the faſhioning of a veſſel: And therefore a man's being prepared for every good
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003867_0031_100266572A19D500"/>
work, intends his being faſhioned as a veſſel, that may ſerve every uſe. It ſuppoſes ſuch an one, in his very make, to have good natural powers and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities, and that theſe be inlarged, and improved and refined by education and ſtudy. To be <hi>prepared for every good work,</hi> ſuppoſes a man of ſuperior accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, a quick apprehenſion, ſolid judgment, and an inlarged thought, able to comprehend a great deal of knowledge, to ſee far &amp; wide, and reach deep into things. It ſuppoſes him alſo ſtored with a great deal of knowledge of various kinds, but eſpecially that he be mighty in the ſcriptures: that he underſtands the doctrines of the goſpel, and the arguments to ſupport them: that he be aware of the errors crept into the church, and able to detect the falſe foundations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they are built: that he be well acquainted with the duties of the chriſtian life, with the reaſons and motives to inforce them: that he be apt to teach, able to convey his tho'ts and ideas of things to others, in a way that ſhall both enlighten their minds and affect their hearts: in a word, he muſt be a ready ſcribe, well inſtructed in affairs relating to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven, and furniſhed for every kind of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, that the miniſterial office is concerned with.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>But then this being prepared for every good work, intends that there be a conſtant readineſs &amp; willingneſs to every ſervice the maſter may call us unto.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He that is prepared to every good work is not idle and ſlothful, he is not backward to any ſervice that his maſter calls him unto. He will be diligent in his maſter's buſineſs, and will go on with chearfulneſs. He won't engage in the buſineſs he is called to by conſtraint, but willingly, and of a ready mind. He won't excuſe himſelf from labour &amp; ſervice thro' ſloth and indolence, or becauſe of the difficulty of the ſervice; neither will he ſuffer himſelf to be ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred with other buſineſs, as not to be able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the work that Chriſt has for him to do. He will look upon himſelf devoted to the ſervice of Chriſt,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:003867_0032_100207298EB5EA38"/>
and will lay aſide every thing that ſhall clog &amp; hinder him in any part of the miniſterial calling.—In a word here, for I may not enlarge; He loves his maſter, and loves his work, and eſteems his wages infinitely beyond the utmoſt ſervice he can poſſibly do, nay and that the very ſervice carries a reward with it; and therefore from a principle of love and gratitude, as well as that of obedience, he readily engages in every ſervice he is ſet about; and rejoyces that he is counted worthy to be imployed in any ſervice for the honour of Chriſt: And therefore he ſticks at no work that Chriſt calls him to, let it be never ſo difficult; but if his maſter enquires, <hi>Whom ſhall I ſend, and who will go for us?</hi> he will (like the prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> when his lips were touched with a coal from the altar) anſwer, <hi>Here am I, ſend me,</hi> Iſai. 6.8.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Obſ. <hi>There are certain things that miniſters muſt be purged and cleanſed from, in order to their being veſſels unto honour, fitted for the maſter's uſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>If a man therefore purge himſelf from theſe, he ſhall be a veſſel unto honour,</hi> &amp;c. implying that there are ſome things cleaving naturally to them, or which they are incident unto, that muſt be taken away in order to their being veſſels unto honour. An unclean filthy veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel can't be a veſſel unto honour, till it be purify'd and cleanſed; and we are all ſuch in our natural ſtate: <hi>for who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.</hi> In our ſtate of nature we are defiled with ſin, and are altogether an unclean thing; and therefore muſt be cleanſed in order to become veſſels of honour. The veſſels of the ſanctuary were to be clean, ſo were they that were to bear them, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 52.11. And or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was expreſly given concerning the Levites, that were to attend the ſervice of the tabernacle, that they ſhould be taken from among the children of Iſrael and cleanſed, <hi>Numb.</hi> 8.6. And there is the ſame reaſon that all who miniſter in holy things, and before a holy God, ſhould be purged &amp; cleanſed from all their filthineſs.</p>
            <p>The prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was ſo ſenſible of this, and of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003867_0033_10026658ADE8E248"/>
the danger of entering upon holy ſervices, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing purged and cleanſed, that he cries out, <hi>Wo is me for I am undone, becauſe I am a man of unclean lips</hi>; and immediately there flies a Seraph with a live coal from off the altar to touch his lips, and ſo his iniquity was taken away, and his ſin purged. And ſurely every one that would be meet for the maſter's uſe, muſt have a live coal to touch him; he muſt have the influences of the Holy Ghoſt to purge &amp; cleanſe him. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6 5, 6.</p>
            <p>Queſt. <hi>But what are the things that ſuch muſt be purged from, that they might be veſſels unto honour</hi> &amp;c?</p>
            <p>Anſ. In general, <hi>from errors in doctrines, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in heart and life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>They muſt be purged from errors, and falſe notions in religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are particularly referred to in my text; <hi>if a man therefore purge himſelf from theſe,</hi> that is from the perſons, or rather the errors of thoſe falſe teachers, <hi>Hymeneus &amp; Philetus,</hi> who had imbibed, and were ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth a moſt dangerous doctrine, that began to ſpread like a gangrene, and had overthrown the faith of ſome. And now as miniſters were to be purged from that groſs error, ſo the reaſon will hold the ſame for their being purged from all other dangerous and deſtructive errors, as well as that particular one, in order to their being fitted for the maſter's uſe. Chriſt was full of truth, as well as grace, yea he was truth it ſelf, and he came to teach and preach and <hi>bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the truth:</hi> And it is highly neceſſary, that every veſſel fit for his uſe, muſt receive the truth as it is in Jeſus. How can that veſſel be fit for Chriſt's uſe (which is to convey the truth) that is already full of error, in matters of religion, both as to the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines and duties of it? How can that man be fit to teach the truth to others, that is himſelf given up to ſtrong deluſions, and made to believe lies? How can that man be fit to teach others the way to ſalvation, that is miſtaken in the way himſelf? I would not be underſtood here as if a man's having ſome miſtaken
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003867_0034_1002665B345435B0"/>
notions in ſome particular points of religion utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits for the ſervice of Chriſt; if ſo, I know not who would be fit for his uſe. For, I may venture to ſay, that there is not a man upon earth, but what labours under ſome miſtakes or other; and many who have by education or prejudice imbib'd falſe notions in ſome leſſer points, have been veſſels unto honour. But what I refer to more eſpecially, are fundamental er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors: errors in the eſſential parts of religion, and that are inconſiſtent with a principle of ſaving grace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. And as to theſe, I ſhall not pretend to enumerate them; not that I think them ſo many, as the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of people imagine.</p>
            <p>But theſe, men muſt be purged from, that would engage in the ſervice of Chriſt; for they diſqualify perſons for that ſacred office. So that it highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns every man, deſigning for, and engaging in this ſervice, to take all poſſible care that he be found in the faith, and that his principles be well eſtabliſhed and confirmed by the oracles of God. And he muſt earneſtly pray that the Spirit of truth would lead him into all truth, and keep him from all errors. And if we ſet our ſelves to a diligent and impartial ſearch after truth in the holy ſcriptures, we may hope to be ſaved from any miſtake that will be hurtful unto our ſelves, or that will unfit us for the maſter's uſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>We muſt be purged from our luſts and corruptions, if we would be veſſels unto honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing does ſo univerſally and effectually diſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify for the ſervice of Chriſt, as the prevailing of our luſts and corruptions. Accordingly this is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to <hi>Timothy</hi> immediately after my text, that <hi>he free all youthful luſts</hi>; intimating hereby that it was abſolutely neceſſary to his being a veſſel unto honour, fit for the maſter's uſe. And ſo it is, for every one that would be a good miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt; he muſt flee all manner of luſts, and get them all ſubdued and mortified. One luſt reigning in the ſoul, and breaking forth in the life, pollutes &amp; diſhonours the veſſel, and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003867_0035_10020730B26CDFE0"/>
makes us unmeet for the holy ſervice of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Here therefore let me ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Such muſt be purged from all fleſhy luſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For as theſe war againſt the ſoul, ſo they war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt; and how unmeet then, muſt they ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the man for his uſe? The man that is under the government of fleſhly luſts, is in a ſtate of enmity and rebellion againſt Chriſt, and all that is holy. And how is ſuch an one prepared unto every good work, when he is inclined to evil, and only evil? How can any be veſſels unto honour, unleſs they know how (as the apoſtle ſays, 1 Theſ. 4.8.) <hi>to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs their veſſels in ſanctification and honour?</hi> Surely if any would be veſſels unto honour, they muſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify the fleſh with the affections and luſts, and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their members upon the earth; fornication and all uncleanneſs, let it not be named among them.</p>
            <p>In a word, miniſters muſt be ſober and temperate in all things, ſuppreſſing their irregular appetites, and keeping their bodies under. The apoſtle was ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the neceſſity of this, that he looked upon himſelf in hazard not only of loſing the ſucceſs of his miniſtry, but of loſing himſelf for ever; and his words ought ſeriouſly to be conſidered, 1 Cor. 9.27. <hi>I keep under my body and bring it into ſubjection, leſt that by any means when I have preached to others, I my ſelf ſhould be a caſt-away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Such muſt be purged from worldly luſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is, they muſt get rid of an inordinate love to the world, and the things that are in the world. For where there is ſuch a love prevailing, there can't be that love to Chriſt, that is neceſſary for his uſe and ſervice. For as our Saviour plainly tells us, Matt. 6.24. <hi>No man can ſerve two maſters; for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or elſe he will hold to the one, and deſpiſe the other. Ye cannot ſerve God and mammon.</hi> Whilſt men's hearts are full of the world, how can they be full of Chriſt? Our love to Chriſt is neceſſary to our feeding his flock, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003867_0036_1002665DD59E1A78"/>
does he demand ſo often of <hi>Peter, Loveſt thou me? Loveſt thou me more than theſe?</hi> For as he ſays Mat. 10 37. <hi>He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me: He that loveth ſon or daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more than me, is not worthy of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Spiritual luſts muſt be purged away, in order to men's being veſſels unto honour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such as unbelief, pride, envy, malice, and the like, which are ſo contrary to Chriſt, and to the deſign of his goſpel kingdom, that it is impoſſible for ſuch, who have theſe luſts reigning in them, to be any way veſſels of honour, meet for the maſter's uſe.</p>
            <p>What can be more improper, than for one that has an evil heart of unbelief (whereby he departs from the living God continually) to be imployed in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying the doctrines of the goſpel to others, and be an inſtrument to perſwade them to believe, what he does not believe himſelf?</p>
            <p>What is more abſurd than for one that has the luſt of pride reigning in him, to be imployed in bringing a meek and lowly Jeſus to the world, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the imitation of him? What more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruous, than for one that is full of hatred, malice and envy, to be imployed in repreſenting Chriſt, and ſetting forth his infinite love &amp; good will to the world?</p>
            <p>I don't ſay but that God may ſuffer ſuch inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be imployed, and knows how to get glory to himſelf by them, and ſo to anſwer his own purpoſes: But according to the natural tendency of things, ſuch men are the moſt likely inſtruments the devil can have to oppoſe the intereſt of Chriſt, and cauſe a revolt over to his own kingdom. And it is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that ſuch miniſters as have been under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of their luſts, have done the moſt of any men in the world to diſhonour Chriſt, and hurt his intereſt in the world, and to overthrow the faith of chriſtians. Which ſhows that miniſters muſt be purged from theſe, if they would in any meaſure be fit for the maſter's uſe and ſervice.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Inf. <hi>Is Chriſt the head and maſter of that houſe, which is the church of the living God, hence his dominion and authority is to be duly acknowledged &amp; ſubmitted to.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is not only head of that great family the church, but head over all things unto the church; ſo that he has the ſole abſolute government of all things in, or any way relating to his church &amp; kingdom. He has the ordering &amp; diſpoſing of every thing in his houſe; he makes what proviſion for it he ſees cauſe, he makes uſe of what veſſels and inſtruments in the houſe he pleaſes, and as long as he pleaſes, and then lays them aſide as ſeemeth good in his ſight, and his ſovereign hand is to be acknowledged herein. He preſcribes rules &amp; orders for his houſe, which are carefully to be regarded by all the houſhold; and theſe he has given us in his word, which we muſt carefully obſerve, and not preſume to ſet up any of our own that are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable herewith. This maſter as <hi>Moſes</hi> was faithful in his houſe, &amp; has given rules ſufficient for his church. We muſt therefore carefully adhere to his inſtitutions, without preſuming to impoſe any inventions of our own.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Inf. Are miniſters but as veſſels in the houſe, <hi>this ſhould give them an humble ſenſe of themſelves, and keep them low in their own minds.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whatever high and honourable uſes they are put to, they muſt remember they are only as veſſels and inſtruments, not as efficient cauſes.</p>
               <p>If they are made uſe of in the converſion of ſinners, it is only as inſtruments in the hand of the Spirit; and they muſt take no other glory to themſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. <hi>Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but miniſters by whom ye believed? So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth, but God that giveth the increaſe.</hi> Miniſters are only the veſſels that bring Chriſt and his goſpel, with all the gracious offers thereof to the ſoul; they can't compel or perſwade men to accept there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; nor can they apply it to their ſouls and conſciences.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003867_0038_10020736315B6BF8"/>
We only bring it to them: It is the almighty Spirit that applies whenever it becomes effectual.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Inf. <hi>How ſhould every miniſter be filled with fear &amp; holy jealouſy, leſt he ne found among the veſſels unto diſhonour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this great houſe there are veſſels of wood &amp; of earth, as well as of gold &amp; of ſilver; ſome unto diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as well as ſome unto honour. And now every miniſter is one or other of theſe; miniſters therefore ſhould be jealous of themſelves, whether they don't by their ſloth and negligence, by their carnal &amp; earthly affections, give reaſon to fear that they are but veſſels of wood and of earth. And are there not ſo many luſts and corruptions working in them, as may make them fear whether they are not veſſels unto diſhonour, and unfit for the maſter's uſe? And when we ſee how unprepared, how unqualified, how backward, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed to many a good work, we are, we may well be ſuſpicious of our ſelves. But oh, with what fear and trembling ſhould this fill our ſouls! For ſuch as are veſſels unto diſhonour, what are they but veſſels of wrath? And ſuch as are unmeet for the maſter's uſe, are fitted for deſtruction.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Inf. <hi>Here is a rule to judge whether we are veſſels unto honour or no,</hi> viz. <hi>our being fit for the maſter's uſe, and prepared unto every good work</hi>

               <p>Theſe are the means that God makes uſe of to fit them for his ſervice.

               <p n="6">6. Inf. <hi>We learn what is to be looked at, in chooſing and ſeparating any to the work of the miniſtry, viz. their being fitted for the maſter's uſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:003867_0039_100207522A5EAE00"/>This is what a people are to look at in the choice of a miniſter; and what miniſters are to look at in ſeparating or ſetting apart any to that ſacred office. It is the maſter that is to uſe and improve them. And unleſs they are fit for his uſe, to what purpoſe are they choſen and ordained to that ſervice. The rule given to <hi>Timothy</hi> was, that <hi>he ſhould commit this work to faithful men, who ſhould be able to teach others alſo,</hi> 2 v. of the context. And therefore it would be an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible betraying of our truſt, to commit this work to unskilful and unfaithful men. Accordingly that muſt needs be a very good rule of prudence, which the ſame apoſtle gives, 1 Tim. 5.22. <hi>Lay hands ſuddenly on no man</hi>; that is, not till we have ſome good grounds to think that they are free from groſs errors and corruptions; that they are like to anſwer the good ends of their miniſtry, &amp; prove veſſels unto honour.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Inf. <hi>We learn what ſuch as are entring on the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, muſt find ſomething of in themſelves, and make it their higheſt ambition to be obtaining more and more of continually, namely, a fitneſs for the maſter's uſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For men to deſire to be <hi>put in the prieſt's office for a piece of bread,</hi> meerly to get a living, without taking any care to be fit for the maſter's uſe, would be da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring preſumption. And it is very doubtful whether ſuch would ever come to be veſſels unto honour. A man entering upon ſuch a ſacred ſervice as this, muſt examine himſelf as to his qualifications and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments for it. I don't mean that a man muſt find himſelf equal to the ſervice he is engaging in; for alas! who is ſufficient for theſe things? But every man muſt ſee ſome degree of fitneſs, before he undertakes: So much knowledge, ſo much grace, ſo much readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Chriſt's ſervice, as may give him good grounds to hope, he may anſwer the end of his office.</p>
               <p>And now, all that remains is to apply what has been ſaid, to the ſolemn occaſions of this day.</p>
               <p>And in the firſt place, I will addreſs my ſelf to you, dear Sir, who I truſt have been applying the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003867_0040_1002073D97176080"/>
ſeveral things that have been offer'd, as they relate to your preſent caſe.</p>
               <p>And here you ſee, that God is calling you, by his providence, and we truſt by his Spirit, to be a veſſel in his houſe; and you are now to be introduced, ſanctified &amp; conſecrated to that holy ſervice. And we truſt (or elſe we dare not lay our hands upon you) that you will be a veſſel unto honour, and that you are in a good meaſure fitted for the maſter's uſe. We truſt that you are free from every error that would be dangerous or hurtful to your maſter's inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and from thoſe luſts and corruptions that would pollute the veſſel, and render it unfit for the ſervice of Chriſt. We hope that you who are by nature un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, have been ſo powerfully touched by the holy Ghoſt, as with a live coal from off the altar, that has taken away your iniquity, and purged your ſin, and ſanctified you throughout in ſpirit, ſoul and body. And if you find any comfortable tokens hereof, you may make an acceptable ſurrender of your ſelf unto the ſervice of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And here I would take notice with thankfulneſs, that we have ſo much reaſon to hope that you are a choſen veſſel, well formed and fitted by Chriſt to bear his name among the Gentiles, even the ignorant heathen, to whom he is now ſending you; and that there is ſuch a hopeful proſpect of ſucceſs among them, by the readineſs there appears in ſo many or them to receive the glad tydings of ſalvation.</p>
               <p>The goſpel miniſtry has it's dangers and it's difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in every place, but the place aſſigned you in the houſe of God has it's peculiar difficulties: and it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a veſſel peculiarly formed, to be fitted for this part of the maſter's uſe. And ſuch an one we truſt you are; and rejoyce that God is inclining and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riting you to that difficult ſervice, even to go to <hi>a people of a ſtrange ſpeech, and of an hard language, whoſe words thou canſt not,</hi> at preſent, <hi>underſtand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You are now to be a conſecrated veſſel in the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:003867_0041_10026662DD784BD8"/>
houſe of the Lord (altho' in a dark part of it). And this imports that your office will be to convey all the treaſures of a glorious goſpel to the people, and to bring back the ſeveral conditions, neceſſities &amp; deſires of the people to God. And what does this imply but that you your ſelf muſt be filled with theſe treaſures in order to your diſpenſing the ſame unto them. Oh labour then to be filled with all that ſpeculative, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and experimental knowledge of God &amp; Chriſt that you can; and that you may be filled even with all the fulneſs of God. Go to the fountain head, to Chriſt, in whom it has pleaſed the father that all ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould dwell: go to him by faith and prayer, and by diligent attendance on reading, meditation and ſtudy; and he will fill you after ſuch a manner, as that you will come to them, in the fulneſs of the bleſſing of the goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And as you will be frequently pouring forth, and diſpenſing to the people, ſo frequently repair to the fountain for a ſupply. Remember that you are but a <hi>veſſel,</hi> and ſo may ſoon be exhauſted without recruits. And as you return to God to be repleniſhed, don't forget to come laden with the wants and deſires of your poor people. Remember to pour out your prayers to God for them, as you pour out or diſpenſe the grace of God to them. And thus endeavour to be full going and coming. And by being thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually imployed in carrying what Chriſt the maſter has to ſend to the people, and bringing back requeſts with thankſgivings upon their account, you will be found a veſſel unto praiſe and honour and glory.</p>
               <p>For altho' the uſe that the maſter puts you to in his houſe, may appear mean and contemptible to the men of the world, who have their hearts ſet upon the gaiety and granduer of it, and can think of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but eaſe and pleaſure; and altho' but few of thoſe who are conſecrated veſſels in the houſe of the Lord, will ſubmit unto it; yet it is a moſt glorious ſervice in the eyes of Chriſt the maſter, &amp; of all the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003867_0042_100266655B34FB28"/>
angels in heaven, that are beholding your ſolemn conſecration: for thoſe miniſtring ſpirits think it their honour to be ſent, and do with pleaſure go forth to miniſter unto them who ſhall be the heirs of ſalvation. And oh what an honour, what a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure muſt it needs be to every one that has a love to Chriſt and a compaſſion for ſouls, to turn men from darkneſs to light, and from the power of ſatan unto God; to convert them from the error of their ways, and to ſave their ſouls from death!</p>
               <p>Wherefore, to carry on the metaphor, don't be aſhamed of the outward meanneſs of the apartment the maſter has aſſigned you in his houſe; and don't be diſcouraged at the difficulties you may have the proſpect of; but let thoſe gracious words of Chriſt, LO I AM WITH YOU ALWAYS, be a comfort to you: and the tokens you have had already of Chriſt's preſence with you, in the ſucceſs of your labours hitherto, may well encourage your further dependance upon him. Go forth therefore in the name &amp; ſtrength of the Lord Jeſus, &amp; we truſt that he will never leave nor forſake you, and that his grace ſhall be ſufficient for you. And let me aſſure you, that if you be wiſe and faithful in this work, you ſhall ſhine as the ſun in the kingdom of your father; and when the chief Shepherd ſhall appear, you ſhall receive an unfading crown of glory.</p>
               <p>And now I would turn my ſelf to the <hi>Houſſatonnoc</hi> Indians, who are at this time to have a miniſter ſent unto them.</p>
               <p>Behold the man, the meſſenger of the Lord of hoſts, that is coming unto you. This is a veſſel God has made choice of, to bring Chriſt, and in him the glad tydings of ſalvation to you. This is the man that is to ſhew you the way to ſalvation; to direct you how you may eſcape the damnation of hell; and how you may obtain the mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto eternal life. See then that you love him, and that you ſteem him very highly in love for his works ſake;
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003867_0043_10020745EC528308"/>
and that you come to him to be inſtructed by him: that you hearken to his counſels, and obſerve his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, and follow his example wherein he follows Chriſt. And this is the way for you to be happy here, and for ever hereafter; for godlineſs hath the promiſe of the life that now is, &amp; of that which is to come.</p>
               <p>To conclude, How earneſtly ſhould we all pray, that there might be numbers of choſen veſſels, perſons fitted and diſpoſed to carry the everlaſting goſpel to the heathen nations that are about us: to convey to them the knowledge of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt, whom to know is life eternal. How ſhould we pity them when we ſee them periſhing for lack of viſion? And how ſhould we be doing our utmoſt to encourage per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to go forth and carry the goſpel to them? And how highly proper would it be for the Government to take effectual care to ſupport and encourage ſuch as God may raiſe up from time to time, to go forth into ſuch difficult ſervice? And ſince many of our nation at home have expreſſed ſuch a tender concern for the propagating the goſpel among the Indian natives of this Land, at ſo great a diſtance from them, by their charitable and pious donations for that purpoſe, it muſt needs be highly reaſonable that we who live among them, and poſſeſs their country, ſhould readily expend of our eſtates, for that which will be of the greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to them. This is a way of honouring the Lord with our ſubſtance, which doubtleſs God expects from us.</p>
               <p>But to have done, Let us be careful to recommend chriſtianity to them, by our own ſincere practice of it. Let us make it manifeſt to them, in all our trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and in all our commerce, and converſation with them, that we are under the influences of the Spirit of Chriſt. In a word, let us adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things, &amp; cauſe our lights ſo to ſhine before them, that they ſeeing our good works, may be moved alſo to glorify our father which is in heaven.</p>

raiſing him from the dead, and giving him Glory, even that Glory which he had with him before the World was, and hath put this peculiar honour upon him as Mediator, in giving all power in Heaven and Earth to Him. We read that the greateſt Perſon that had been born of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man thought himſelf not worthy to hear his Shoes after him: And the holy Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> thus expreſſes himſelf, <hi>To me is this Grace given that I ſhould preach among the Gentiles the unſearchable riches of Chriſt.</hi> To preach CHRIST, &amp; the great Salvation he has wro't out for a ſinful World, tho' at preſent far leſs profitable, yet is not leſs honourable than any Service that Men are imployed in in this World; and they who obtain mercy of the Lord to be faithful in it, and are inſtrumental to turn many to Righteouſneſs, <hi>ſhall ſhine as the Stars for ever &amp; ever.</hi>
