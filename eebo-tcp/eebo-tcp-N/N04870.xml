            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>FOR the Vineyard of the Lord of Hoſts, is the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Men of <hi>Judah</hi> his pleaſant Plant: And he looked for Judgment, but behold Oppreſſion; for Righteouſneſs, but behold a Cry.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Verſe is the Reſolution, or Explica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the foregoing Parable, which GOD ſends by his Prophet to his People <hi>Iſrael</hi> concerning his Vineyard. <hi>Now will I ſing to my well-beloved a Song of my Beloved touching his Vineyard: My well-heloved hath a Vineyard in a very fruitful Hill: And he fenced it, and gathered out the Stones thereof,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="unknown:006090_0004_102782FB57298CD8"/>
            <p>And now we are told the Meaning of this Parable, and what God deſigned hereby to ſignify to his People, namely his diſtinguiſhing Favours to them, and the juſt Expectations he had from them, and what wretched Returns they made him, and how they provoked him to come out againſt them, to withdraw his Protections from them, to bring many heavy Judgments upon them, and finally to reject them. For here he expreſly declares that <hi>the Vineyard of the Lord of Hoſts is the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the Men of</hi> Judah <hi>his pleaſant Plant.</hi> They were God's peculiar People; God had ſeparated them, and diſtinguiſhed them by his ſpecial Favours, from all the Nations of the Earth. He <hi>fenced</hi> them about as a Man does his Vineyard, with the ſpecial Protections of his Providence: And took out from among them thoſe Things, that would obſtruct their Flouriſhing, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Fruitfulneſs, as a Man would gather up the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>es,</hi> and caſt them out of his Vineyard. And as the wiſe and prudent Man plants his Vineyard with the choiceſt and <hi>best Vines;</hi> ſo God planted the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Nation with the beſt Religion, and ſettled them upon the beſt Principles of any Nation in the World. <hi>He gave them right Judgments, and true Laws, good Statutes, and Commandments.</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">Neh. ix. 13.</note>. In theſe Reſpects he <hi>planted them a noble Vine, wholly a right Seed</hi>
               <note n="b" place="bottom">Jer. ii. 21.</note>.</p>
            <p>And as the Owner of a Vineyard builds a <hi>Tower</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; that is, a Place proper for him to come to, and lodge in, for the Defence and Inſpection of his Vineyard, that he might be preſent to obſerve, direct and encourage his Labourers; and to defend his Vineyard: So God ſet up his <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> and then <hi>his Temple,</hi> the Tokens of his Preſence with them, to guide and defend and bleſs them. <hi>A Vineyard of red Wine, I the Lord do keep it, I will
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006090_0005_102782FCD95A8638"/>water it every Moment leaſt any hurt it: I will keep it Night and Day</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.3.</note>.</p>
            <p>So again, As the Owner of a Vineyard builds a <hi>Wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs</hi> for his Grapes, ſo God ſet up his Altar, and his Ordinances among them. But now when the Owner of the Vineyard had been at ſuch Coſt and Pains with his Vineyard, he very juſtly expected that it ſhould bring forth <hi>Grapes,</hi> the beſt of Grapes: But behold it brought forth <hi>wild Grapes!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus it was with God's People <hi>Iſrael:</hi> When he had ſeparated them for his own peculiar People, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed them above all the Nations of the Earth, by giving them his Laws, Statutes &amp; Judgments, &amp; affording ſpecial Protections and Bleſſings to them, he expected that they ſhould bring forth the Fruits of Righteouſneſs; but behold the contrary. <hi>He looked for Judgment, but behold Oppreſſion, for Righteouſneſs, but behold a Cry,</hi> as in the Text. By which we ſee, that by <hi>Grapes</hi> in the Parable is more eſpecially intended Righteouſneſs, Truth and Goodneſs among Men: For tho' that be not all the Fruit that is expected from ſuch a People; yet it is an eſſential Part, and without which there is no good Fruit among them. We alſo find that Injuſtice and Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is intended by the <hi>wild Grapes.</hi> For Acts of Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and Injuſtice, are like wild, ſowre Grapes, yea, they are like <hi>the Grapes of Gall whoſe Cluſters are bitter.</hi>
               <note n="d" place="bottom">Deut. xxvii. 32.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, It is to be obſerved that the Vineyard brought forth <hi>Grapes,</hi> but they were not genuine; they were Grapes in Appearance, but when they were exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined they were found to be but wild Grapes, ſowre and bitter: So it may ſignify, that tho' inſtead of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there was Oppreſſion; yet there was ſome Shew of, and Pretences to Righteouſneſs among them. What
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006090_0006_102782FE5B65A430"/>appeared to be Juſtice was but Oppreſſion and Injuſtice. <hi>They ſought God as a Nation that did Righteouſneſs, they ask of him the Ordinances of Juſtice</hi>
               <note n="e" place="bottom">Iſai. lviii. 2.</note>. But their <hi>Judgment was turned into Gall</hi>
               <note n="f" place="bottom">Amos vi. 12.</note>.</p>
            <p>And thus God, ſpeaking after the Manner of Men, was as much diſappointed about his People <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as the Owner of the Vineyard was about the Fruit of it.</p>
            <p>And what does the Owner of the Vineyard do upon this Diſappointment? Why firſt of all he appeals to the Inhabitants of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and Men of <hi>Judah,</hi> to judge between him and his Vineyard, and ſay whether he had not done all that was proper for the Vineyard; and <hi>whether he could have done any more than he had done?</hi> So God appealed to the Conſciences of his People <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to judge whether he had not done all that was proper for him to do; and thereby ſets forth their utter Inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſableneſs, that when he had taken ſuch ſpecial Care of them, and uſed ſuch Means with them, that they inſtead of bringing forth Righteouſneſs, Truth and Goodneſs, ſhould bring forth nothing better than Iniquity and Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
            <p>In the next Place he draws up a Reſolution what he would do to his Vineyard; namely, that he would <hi>take away the Hedge thereof, that it ſhould be eaten up: And break down the Wall thereof, that it ſhould be trodden down, and lay it waſte,</hi> &amp;c. By which God ſignified, that as his People had thus wretchedly failed of anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his juſt Expectations and Demands; he would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his ſpecial Protections, and withold his Bleſſings from them; and would give them up, and caſt them off from being his People. All which was afterward punctually fulfilled.</p>
            <pb n="9" facs="unknown:006090_0007_102783015B25F768"/>
            <p>Accordingly the Text as it ſtands connected with the foregoing Parable, affords theſe ſeveral Obſervations, worthy our moſt ſerious Conſideration at ſuch a Day as this, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>And among all the Nations of the Earth, God choſe the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſeparated them to himſelf from all other People upon Earth. <hi>He choſe Jacob unto himſelf, and Iſrael for his peculiar Treaſure</hi>
               <note n="h" place="bottom">Pſal. cxxxv. 4.</note>. Now he did not ſet his Love on them, and chooſe them becauſe they were more in Number than any People; for they were <hi>the fewest of all People</hi>
               <note n="i" place="bottom">Deut. vii. 7</note> Nor was it <hi>for their Righteouſneſs</hi> that he diſtinguiſhed them with his Favours for <hi>they were a ſtiff-necked People</hi>
               <note n="k" place="bottom">Deut. ix. 6.</note>.

            <p>And did accordingly diſtinguiſh them from all other People; as a Man does his Vineyard, his Field, his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, or his Garden from all other Lands. He encloſed them with a Covenant of Peculiarity, giving them the Sign of Circumciſion as the Seal thereof. And he fenced them with his Power and ſpecial Providence as with an impregnable <hi>Wall. He was a Wall of Fire round about them.</hi> Moreover, He planted them with the Principles of true Religion, with the Word of God, that incorruptible Seed that liveth and abideth forever. He alſo ſet up his Tabernacle, and his Temple as a <hi>Tower</hi> in the midſt of them; and gave them his Prieſts, his Altars, and all his Ordinances, even all the Means of Grace that they could reaſonably deſire. Thus during the Time of the <hi>Moſaic</hi> Diſpenſation, which was full 1500 Years, <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> were the Vineyard of the Lord of Hoſts, the only viſible Church God had upon Earth.</p>

            <p>But now ſince they are for their obſtinate Infidelity broken down and laid waſte, and Chriſtianity eſtabliſhed in the World, the <hi>Chriſtian viſible Church</hi> is now to be conſidered as the Vineyard of the Lord of Hoſts. Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians are hedged in with the Goſpel-Covenant; they are ſecured and defended as with a Wall by the Power and the Grace of CHRIST, the great King and Head of his Church, ſo that the Gates of Hell have never as yet ſo prevailed againſt it, as to lay it utterly waſte. Indeed the Church of God has been very much waſted and over-run with the <hi>Mahometan</hi> Impoſture, and with the Errors and Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of the <hi>Man of Sin:</hi> But bleſſed be God ſome Parts of it have been reſcued out of the Hands of its Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and brought again under the Divine Cultivations, and bleſſed with ſpiritual Bleſſings in heavenly Things in Chriſt Jeſus; favoured with the clear Light of the Goſpel, with faithful Miniſters and pure Ordinances, and with all Means proper to enlighten, convince and awaken: Yea, and with the concurring Influences of the bleſſed Spirit to convert and turn them to God, and make very fruitful Chriſtians of them. He cauſes his Doctrine to drop as the Rain, and his Speech to diſtill as the Dew, and as the ſmall Rain upon the tender Herb. He gives them Line upon Line, Precept upon Precept, here a little, and there a little as it is needed. So that with Reſpect to ſome Parts of God's viſible Church it may truly be ſaid, that no Maſter of a Vineyard takes more Care for the Defence and Cultivation of it, than God does of them.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Obſ. <hi>God looks for</hi> JUDGMENT <hi>and</hi> RIGHTEOUSNESS <hi>from a People whom he thus diſtinguiſhes by his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Favours.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>And he looked that it ſhould bring forth Grapes.</hi> The Owner of the Vineyard after he had taken ſuch Pains with it, as to fence, and clear, and plant, and cultivate
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006090_0010_1027830BD6737F60"/>it, expected it ſhould bring forth Grapes, that is good Grapes; and it was juſt and reaſonable for him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it. So reaſonable it is for God to look for <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> from a People that he has been uſing ſpecial Means with for that End.</p>
            <p>When it is ſaid that God <hi>looks</hi> for Righteouſneſs &amp; Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from ſuch a People, it is to be conſidered as ſpoken after the Manner of Men: That Men in ſuch a Caſe would and might very reaſonably look for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Judgment from them. But ſtrictly ſpeaking God can be ſaid to look for nothing, but what really will be; <hi>for known unto God are all his Works from the Beginning to the End,</hi> and ſo he cannot be diſappointed, or have any Thing come to paſs without his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or contrary to his Expectation. But in Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation to our Capacities God may be ſaid to look for Righteouſneſs and Judgment; the Meaning of which is, that it is highly reaſonable that a People ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed ſhould manage their Affairs with Righteouſneſs and Judgment, and God requires and demands it of them. Accordingly in ſuch a Senſe as this God looks for Righteouſneſs and Judgment from his Church and People, whom he hath ſet apart for himſelf, and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed with peculiar Advantages.</p>
            <p>Here then let me ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God looks for Righteouſneſs and Judgment from the</hi> RULERS <hi>of ſuch a People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſpake by me, and his Word was in my Tongue; the God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſaid, the Rock of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſpoke by me, He that ruleth over Men muſt be</hi> JUST, <hi>ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Fear of God</hi>
               <note n="m" place="bottom">2 Sam. xxiii. 2, 3.</note>. And as Rulers are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed into thoſe who <hi>make,</hi> and thoſe who <hi>execute</hi> the Laws; ſo from each of theſe Bodies God looks for Righteouſneſs and Judgment.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="unknown:006090_0011_1027830ED6635E78"/>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God expects and demands it from the</hi> LAW-MAKERS <hi>among a People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He looks that they exerciſe all their Wiſdom, and Care, and Conſcience in making Laws and Orders for the People; that they exerciſe the utmoſt Care and Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion leaſt they ſhould <hi>eſtabliſh Iniquity by a Law,</hi> or <hi>decree any unrighteous Decree;</hi> leaſt they ſhould make any Laws repugnant to the Laws of God, or that have a Tendency to pervert, or obſtruct the free Courſe of Juſtice. He looks that they make no Laws from pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and ſelfiſh Views, which are apparently injurious to others. And he looks that they never refuſe to Enact any Laws and Orders, which are plainly juſt and equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, becauſe they will thwart any private Intereſt of their own. He looks that they take all poſſible Care in framing the Laws, to have them full, and clear, and without Ambiguity, that they may be a Remedy for every Diſorder, and that no Perſon in the Government ſhould have reaſon to complain that they are oppreſſed and injured, and there is no Law to help them. Yea, God looks that ſuch Laws and Ordinances be eſtabliſhed, that Juſtice may have its free Courſe, and <hi>Judgment run down as Waters, and Righteouſneſs as a mighty Stream,</hi> conſtantly and irreſiſtibly.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God looks for it from the</hi> JUDGES <hi>of the Land, even from all who have the executive Power in their Hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Demand he has upon them is, that they faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and impartially execute the good and wholeſome Laws of a Land; that they judge uprightly, and without Reſpect of Perſons; that they hear the Poor as well as the Rich, and don't lean to one Side out of Fear or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, nor to the other out of Pity: But that they take all poſſible Care that the Law be not ſlacked; but that right Judgment may proceed from them, juſtifying the Righteous and condemning the Wicked. He looks alſo
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006090_0012_102783109DFCECF8"/>for the faithful Execution of every righteous Sentence; and that inſtead of bearing the Sword in vain, they be a Terror to Evil-Doers, and a Praiſe to them that do well; and that all the <hi>Officers be Peace,</hi> and the <hi>Exactors, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> exacting what is juſt and right, but without Oppreſſion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God looks for Righteouſneſs from his</hi> MINISTERS.</p>
            <p>He requires that they be eminently holy, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently very juſt and upright in all their Concerns with Men; that they be as remote as poſſible from every Thing that is defrauding, over-reaching or unfair, or that has ſo much as the Appearance of Diſhoneſty: And that inſtead thereof, they be bright Examples of Juſtice and Truth, as well as Goodneſs. Moreover, He looks that they ſhould be not only Patterns, but <hi>Preachers of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs:</hi> That they not only preach up the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt as the meritorious Cauſe of our Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication before God: but that they preach up the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt, and without which there is no true Chriſtianity. He expects that Miniſters preach up moral Honeſty, as abſolutely neceſſary to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and plainly declare that the <hi>Unrighteous ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God</hi>
               <note n="n" place="bottom">1 Cor, vi, 9.</note>. And that when Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs or any other Sin prevails, that <hi>they cry aloud and do not ſpare</hi>
               <note n="o" place="bottom">Iſai. lviii. 8.</note>.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>God looks for Righteouſneſs from all the</hi> PEOPLE.</p>
            <p>That they renounce all the hidden Things of Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty; that they neither defraud, over-reach, or oppreſs one another; but that they deal juſtly with all Men, and ſpeak the Truth to their Neighbour: That <hi>they render unto all their Dues, Tribute to whom Tribute is due, Cuſtom to whom Cuſtom, Fear to whom Fear, Honour to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006090_0013_102783169A0FB120"/>whom Honour; that they owe no Man any Thing, but to love one another</hi>
               <note n="p" place="bottom">Rom. xiii. 7, 8.</note>. And, in ſhort, he expects the golden Rule of Juſtice to be obſerved by every Man, even to do to others as he would they ſhould do to him under the like Circumſtances; <hi>for this is the Law and the Prophets</hi>
               <note n="p" place="bottom">Matth. vii. 12.</note>. And now God may well look for Righteouſneſs and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from a People, and from every Order of Men among them, who are thus diſtinguiſhed by his ſpecial Favours. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>He reveals himſelf to ſuch a People as a righteous Lord who loveth Righteouſneſs,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He exhibits himſelf to ſuch a People as an infinitely righteous and holy God; that <hi>Righteouſneſs and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are the Habitation of his Throne</hi>
               <note n="q" place="bottom">Pſal. xcvii. 2.</note>; that he <hi>is a God of Truth, and without Iniquity; just and right is he</hi>
               <note n="r" place="bottom">Deut. xxxii. 4.</note>. And that <hi>with him is no Reſpect of Perſons, nor taking of Gifts</hi>
               <note n="s" place="bottom">2 Chron. xix. 7.</note>.</p>
            <p>Now when god thus reveals himſelf to a People what can be reaſonably expected or demanded from them, but that they ſhould copy after this glorious Pattern, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to recommend themſelves to ſuch a righteous God, by conforming to him in this moral Excellency of his Nature?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>He gives them the Ordinances of Juſtice, whereby he teaches them what is Righteouſneſs and Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus God gives to ſuch a People the Precepts of the moral Law, which are ſo many Rule of Righteouſneſs: And the Precepts of the ſecond Table are a Summary of the Rules of Truth and Juſtice with reſpect to one another. And thro' the whole Bible (which is put into the Hands of ſuch a People) God is giving them particular Directions is this Matter, leading ſuch (as will diligently ſearch the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006090_0014_102783199A4F88E0"/>ſame,) plainly to ſee what is right, and what is wrong; what is true, and what is falſe; what is juſt, and what is unjuſt: And then conſidering God has written to his People the great Things of his Law, and has made the Rules of Truth and Juſtice ſo plain, that he that runs may read; it is highly reaſonable that he ſhould look for, and demand Truth and Righteouſneſs from ſuch a People. For they cannot truly plead Ignorance in the Matter; becauſe if they are ignorant of what is juſt and true, it is a willful or careleſs Ignorance; neither of which will excuſe them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>God may well look for Righteouſneſs and Judgment from ſuch a People, becauſe he has ſo frequently, and ſo fully declared how much he requires and inſiſts upon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He hath ſhewed thee O Man what is good, and what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but to do</hi> JUSTLY, <hi>to love Mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> And how poſitive and expreſs are his Commands with Reſpect to Rulers, that they ſhould be JUST <hi>ruling in the Fear of God</hi>
               <note n="t" place="bottom">2. Sam. xxiii. 3.</note>? And how does he charge them to <hi>judge</hi> with <hi>just Judgment,</hi> and <hi>not wrest Judgment, nor reſpect Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, neither take a Gift,</hi> becauſe a <hi>Gift blindeth the Eyes?</hi> Yea that <hi>which was altogether just,</hi> ſhould they follow<note n="u" place="bottom">Deut. xvi. 18, 19, 20.</note>. And how ſtrictly did he charge the People ſaying, Thou <hi>ſhalt not deal falſly, nor lye one to another: Thou ſhalt not defraud thy Neighbour, neither rob him; ye ſhall do no Unrighteouſneſs in Judgment, in mete Yard, in Weight or in Meaſure; just Ballances, just Weights, a just Ephah, and a just Hin ſhall ye have: I am the Lord</hi>
               <note n="w" place="bottom">Lev. xix. 11, 13.</note>.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, God plainly declares that <hi>to do Juſtice and Judgment was more acceptable to him than Sacrifice</hi>
               <note n="x" place="bottom">Prov. xxi. 3.</note>: And that he will not accept of any Sacrifices, or any

            <p>On the other Hand, how does God extol and ſet forth the Excellency of Truth and Juſtice? He tells us that <hi>Righteouſneſs exalteth a Nation.</hi> That <hi>the Throne is eſtabliſhed by Righteouſneſs</hi>

And who can think any other but that a People who have theſe Things ſo plainly taught, and ſtrongly inculcated upon them, would bring forth Righteouſneſs and Judgment.

Notwithſtanding God had made ſuch clear Diſcoveries of his own Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Truth unto his People, and had given them the moſt full and expreſs Commands about Truth, &amp; Juſtice and Charity; and was ſo frequently calling upon them moſt carefully to obſerve thoſe Things, as Matters of much greater Weight and Importance, than all their Burnt-offerings and Sacrifices: And notwithſtanding all their Profeſſions and Pretenſions as a <hi>holy People,</hi> and as <hi>a Nation that did Righteouſneſs;</hi> yet alas inſtead of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering God's juſt Expectations and Demands, as to theſe Things, it was the quite contrary.

They kept up their Sacrifices, their holy Days, and their ſolemn Meetings, and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied them even beyond the divine Inſtitution: But they failed moſt dreadfully in Truth, Juſtice and common Honeſty.

<pb n="30" facs="unknown:006090_0028_10278345481E2BB8"/>among us. He planted Churches and ſettled them with able and faithful Paſtors; many of them burning and ſhining Lights. And ſo there was the free Enjoyment of the Goſpel and the bleſſed Ordinances thereof.</p>
            <p>Moreover, He erected not only Schools of Learning, but Colleges, and ſuch publick Societies for the Education of Youth, whereby Knowledge and Piety might be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Poſterity. Which Seminaries have been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to this Day, and many Plants of Renown have been tranſplanted out of them into the ſeveral Parts of the Vineyard. And we may ſay, that the Vine which God brought over into this Wilderneſs, has taken Root and exceedingly flouriſhed, ſo that we may ſing and ſay to the Glory of God, correſponding with the Pſalmiſt<note n="b" place="bottom">Pſal. lxxx. 8, 9, 10, 11.</note>. <hi>Thou broughteſt a Vine out of Egypt,</hi> ſo haſt thou out of <hi>England: Thou hast caſt out the Heathen, and planted it. Thou prepareſt Room before it, and didſt cauſe it to take deep Root, and it filled the Land. The Hills were covered with the Shadow of it, and the Boughs thereof were like the goodly Cedars. She ſent out her Boughs unto the Sea, and her Branches unto the River.</hi> Thus the People of <hi>New-England</hi> may truly be ſaid to be the Vineyard of the Lord of Hoſts.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Most certainly the great and holy God has looked for Righteouſneſs and Judgment from us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He looked that it ſhould bring forth Grapes.</hi> The Owner and Dreſſer of the Vineyard does no more look for Grapes from a well-dreſs'd Vineyard, than God has looked for, or demanded Righteouſneſs and Judgment from this People. The Advantages we have had, and the Obligations we are under to bring ſorth Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:006090_0029_10278346CAB253B8"/>make it infinitely juſt and reaſonable for God to expect and demand it of us.</p>
            <p>For let us conſider, Are we not under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great King and Head of the Church; the Sceptre of whoſe Kingdom is a <hi>Sceptre of Righteouſneſs,</hi> and who <hi>reigns in Righteouſneſs,</hi> and the Principles of whoſe Kingdom are <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> as well as Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt? What more reaſonable then, than that this People who profeſs Subjection to this King ſhould conform to the Rules of Righteouſneſs in all their Ways?</p>
            <p>Moreover, the Goſpel that we have the free Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of, is the <hi>Word of Righteouſneſs.</hi> This Grace of God which has appeared unto us bringing Salvation, teaches us to deny all Ungodlineſs and worldly Luſts, and to live ſoberly, <hi>righteouſly</hi> and godly in this preſent World<note n="c" place="bottom">Titus ii. 12.</note>. And it plainly ſets the Rules of Truth, Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and Honeſty before us. And loudly calls upon us, ſaying, Whatſoever Things are <hi>juſt,</hi> whatſoever Things are <hi>true,</hi> whatſoever Things are <hi>honeſt,</hi> to think on theſe Things<note n="d" place="bottom">Phil. iv. 8.</note>. For Chriſt expreſly declares to us, that <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Mercy</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> are the weightier Matters of the Law<note n="e" place="bottom">Matth. xxiii. 23,</note>. And this Word cautions us all againſt being deceived, plainly declaring to us, that neither <hi>Unrighteous,</hi> nor <hi>Thieves,</hi> nor <hi>Covetous,</hi> nor <hi>Extortioners</hi> ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God<note n="f" place="bottom">1 Cor vi. 9, 10.</note>.</p>
            <p>And now, What can be more reaſonably expected from the People of this Land, who profeſs the Belief of the holy Scriptures, and take them for the Rule of their Faith and Practice, but that they ſhould bring forth the Fruits of Righteouſneſs.</p>

            <p>Again, Has not God been raiſing up and ſending forth his Miniſters, who have been reproving the People for Sins of Injuſtice and Oppreſſion; calling upon them to deal juſtly with all Men, and ſpeak the Truth one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſetting theſe Things forth as eſſential Parts of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity? And have not theſe faithful Prophets of the Land cried aloud in this Matter on publick Occaſions, as particularly on <hi>Faſt-Days,</hi> when the People have been told, that to do <hi>Juſtice and Judgment was more accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God than Burnt-offerings and Sacrifices.</hi> And then upon Days of <hi>General Election,</hi> how often has this whole Government been addreſs'd, in the moſt ſolemn moving Manner, to ſee to the making juſt and good Laws, to prevent all Injuſtice and Oppreſſion, and to the faithful Execution of them; and when the Government have ſent their Thanks to ſuch Miniſters for their faithful Diſcourſes, and have made them publick: I ſay, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering theſe Things, What more reaſonably to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from ſuch Rules and People, than that they ſhould, in all their Proceedings, pay the higheſt Regard to Truth and Juſtice?</p>
            <p>Again, Has not God brought many Judgments upon this People<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And what could God reaſonably expect, but that we ſhould hear the Rod, and turn to him that ſmiteth; and break off all our Sins by Righteouſneſs, and our Iniquities by ſhewing Mercy to the Poor? Surely God expects that <hi>when his Judgments are abroad in the Earth, the Inhabitants of the World ſhould learn Righteouſneſs</hi>

            <p>Again, Have we not made high Profeſſions of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and great Pretences to it; and conſequently to Truth and Juſtice, which are eſſential Parts of our holy Religion? Have we not ſet ourſelves up as ſome of the moſt religious People in the world? And are we not abundant in religious Duties? Is not that our Character which God gave of his People <hi>Iſrael? They ſeek me daily, and delight to know my Ways, as a Nation that did Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and forſook not the Ordinances of their God, They aſk of me the Ordinances of Juſtice: They take De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in approaching to God</hi>
               <note n="h" place="bottom">Iſai. lviii. 2.</note>. And now what might more reaſonably be expected from ſuch a profeſſing Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, than Juſtice, Truth and Honeſty?</p>
            <p>Finally here, Has not God ſent his holy Spirit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince this People of <hi>Sin, Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Judgment?</hi> Has not the bleſſed Spirit been very much ſtriving with the People of this Land, of late Years? And now what might God reaſonably expect, but that Juſtice, Truth and Goodneſs, that are the Fruits of the Spirit, ſhould be brought forth? We are told by the Prophet, that when the <hi>Spirit is poured forth upon us from o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <note n="i" place="bottom">Iſai. xxxii. 17, 10.</note>. Well then, if the Spirit has been poured out, and eſpecially if it has been poured out in ſuch a plentiful Meaſure as ſome have thought, ſurely there might well be expected Plenty of Juſtice, Plenty of Truth and Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>And thus, by conſidering a Multitude of Things, it plainly appears, that God may look for Righteouſneſs and Judgment from us, full as much as from his People <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old. For God may as well appeal to us as he did to them, and ſay, <hi>What could have been done more to my Vineyard, that I have not done unto it?</hi>

            <p>But now nothing is more natural, than to enquire, whence there is ſuch Oppreſſion and a Cry, by Reaſon of it; and how it comes to paſs?</p>
            <p>And this we may depend upon, that one and all will be for clearing themſelves. One will ſay, It is not in me; and another will ſay, It is not in me. But if the Matter be thoroughly and impartially examined, I believe many more will be to be blamed than are aware of it. For my Part, I am at a Loſs to ſay who is altogether clear, And would to God that every Man in the Land, from the higheſt to the loweſt, would put the Queſtion cloſely to his own Conſcience, ſaying, <hi>What have I done?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A covetous ſelfiſh Spirit,</hi> which reigns among all Sorts of People, is doubtleſs the grand Cauſe of all the Cry by Reaſon of Oppreſſion. The ſad Caſe of this People is the Reverſe of what the Apoſtle recommends, <hi>for all ſeek their own, and not anothers Wealth</hi>
               <note n="l" place="bottom">1 Cor. x. 24.</note>: And <hi>every Man looks at his own Things, and not at the Things of others.</hi> And then no wonder if they who have it in their Power, oppreſs their Neighbours. Where a worldly, ſelfiſh Spirit prevails, there will be <hi>Oppreſſion</hi> inſtead of <hi>Judgment,</hi> and a <hi>Cry</hi> inſtead of <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then the Cry is at the <hi>Bills of Credit,</hi> the <hi>Paper Medium of Exchange</hi> of this and the neighbouring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, as what is the grand Occaſion of the Injuſtice and Oppreſſion that is in the Land. For one and all agree, that the Sinking of the Value of theſe Bills below what
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:006090_0035_102783579882BFF0"/>is expreſſed in the Face of them, is the Cauſe of the preſent Complaints and Cries that are heard in the Land.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>But now how comes it to paſs that theſe Bills of Credit ſhould be the Occaſion or Means of ſo much Oppreſſion? How come they to ſink ſo as to cauſe ſuch a univerſal Cry?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some ſay it is from the <hi>little Regards that have been paid to the ſeveral Acts of Government for ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Credit and Value of their Bills.</hi> That notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what is declared in the Face of the Bills, as the Value of them, and notwithſtanding the Laws that have been made to keep up their Value; that <hi>Merchants</hi> and other <hi>Traders</hi> have by their Practice in Trade run them down: Giving more of them for Silver and Gold, than the ſeveral Governments have ſet them at; and then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing upon their Goods accordingly. And that their Practice has put the <hi>Huſbandman</hi> and the <hi>Tradeſman</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on doing the like with their Commodities; by which Means the Bills have loſt their original Value.</p>
            <p>And ſo it is alledged, that the crying Injuſtice and Oppreſſion of the Land, is owing to People's not pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a due Regard to the Acts of Government, and not doing proper Honour to the publick Bills: And that if thoſe who firſt tranſgreſſed the Laws (in thoſe Caſes made and provided) had been detected, and duly puniſhed, and ſo made Examples of publick Juſtice, for a Warning to others; the Value of the Bills would have been upheld: And that if Merchants and Traders had acted the generous Part, for the Good of the Provinces, had held their Laws to be ſacred, and united their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours agreable to the ſaid Laws, they might have kept the Bills from ſinking in ſuch a Manner as they have done.</p>
            <p>And doubtleſs there is Blame lying upon theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: For if they had all been governed by a publick
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:006090_0036_1027835A9E3F4170"/>Spirit, they would have united their Endeavours to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the publick Credit. But for want of this Spirit, and from a greedy Deſire of Gain, and from a craving Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per indulged in all Sorts of People, ſtriving to advance the Prices of all their Goods, theſe Calamities have come upon us.</p>
            <p>But then,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Theſe excuſe themſelves, and ſay, the real Cauſe of the preſent Calamity, <hi>is the Nature of the Bills them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the depreciating Tendency of them; and that by a Neceſſity of Nature they ſink and loſe their Value.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the Bottom upon which they are eſtabliſhed, and the Conduct of the ſeveral Governments with Reſpect to them, ever ſince they have had a Currency in the Land, has been ſuch, that it is impoſſible for them, in the very Nature and Courſe of Things, to keep up their Credit, and hold the Value that is expreſſed in them: And ſo the Fault is thrown upon the Bills themſelves; that they in their very Nature and Conſtitution cannot ſupport the Value expreſſed in them; but that they muſt and will ſink of Courſe.</p>

            <p>And inaſmuch as the loud Cry of Oppreſſion is by Reaſon of a <hi>ſinking Medium;</hi> I do in my Heart wiſh that all the Governments in <hi>New-England</hi> would take that Matter into their moſt ſerious Conſideration, and enquire how far there are Grounds for ſuch a Cry: And to examine into the Nature and Foundation of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sorts of Bills that are now paſſing among them; and ſee whether they be upon ſuch a Bottom as can be vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated by the Rules of Wiſdom, and by the Laws of Truth and Juſtice. And I think God in his Providence is loudly calling not only this, but all the other Provinces to it.</p>
            <p>And would to God that our General Aſſembly would review the ſeveral Sorts of Bills that are paſſing among us; <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe of the <hi>Old Tenor,</hi> of the <hi>Threefold</hi> or <hi>Middle Tenor,</hi> (ſo called) of the <hi>New Tenor,</hi> and of the <hi>Laſt Emiſſion:</hi> And ſee whether according to the Faces of thoſe Bills they are reconcileable one with another, and all of them with Truth and Juſtice.</p>
            <p>And were I now preaching to the General Court, I would propoſe, and ſubmit to their Wiſdom and Juſtice, whether the following Inquiries might not be proper for them to make; as what might lead them to ſee whether there have been any Miſtakes in former Aſſemblies rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the <hi>Medium:</hi> And lead them more clearly to ſee how to correct them, if there has been any ſuch.</p>
            <p>Whether the <hi>Old Tenor</hi> Bills declared a Truth when they ſay, that the Value ſpecified in them, <hi>is due from the Province to the Poſſeſſor, is in Value equal to Money, and ſhall be accordingly accepted by the Treaſurer,</hi> &amp;c? And if ſo much Money as the Bill expreſſed was due to the Poſſeſſor; whether it ought not in Juſtice to have been paid by the Province, from whom it is declared to be due? And whether ever that Promiſe of the Province has been perform'd?</p>
            <pb n="41" facs="unknown:006090_0039_10278365691BED00"/>
            <p>Whether the Promiſe of <hi>Silver</hi> at ſuch a Rate in the <hi>Threefold</hi> or <hi>Middle Tenor Bills</hi> (ſo called) has been ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled?</p>
            <p>Whether the <hi>New Tenor Bills,</hi> which expreſs no greater Value in the Face of them than thoſe of the <hi>Old Tenor,</hi> can truly and juſtly be deemed <hi>four Times</hi> ſo valuable? And whether when Perſons have been obliged to receive them as equivalent to <hi>four Times</hi> ſo much of the Old Tenor Bills, it could be called a full Payment of what was due to the Poſſeſſor of the Old Bills? And whether many Perſons have not been really injured, who have taken them in ſuch a Proport<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>on; eſpecially for Bonds, and other Debts, contracted ſo long ago as when the Old Tenor Bills were of equal Value with thoſe of the New? And whether the Eſtates of Colleges, and other Societies, which lay in Bonds for Bills of the Old Tenor; and of ſo long ſtanding as when they were (as they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>How are the Words on the Face of the preſent Bills to be conſtrued ſo as to correſpond with Truth, either in the declaratory or promiſſory Part of them?</p>
            <p>In what Senſe can they be ſaid to be equal in Value to Silver at ſo much an Ounce, as is expreſſed in the Bills if they go out of the Treaſury, and are treated in all common Trade and Buſineſs, at no more than half that Value? And for Bills that <hi>now</hi> go out of the Treaſury, how can they be ſaid to be due to the <hi>Poſſeſſor</hi> according to the <hi>Sum</hi> expreſſed in the <hi>Bill,</hi> if really there is in Value received but one Half of what is expreſſed?</p>
            <p>And as to the promiſſory Part of the Bills, let it be enquired and conſidered, whether Perſons in publick Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are not obliged to maintain as ſtrict a Regard to Truth, as to what they declare and promiſe in their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Capacity, as Perſons in private Life; and whether a

And whether the publick Faith relating to the promiſſory Part of the Bills, has been kept ſacred and inviolable, as it ought to be? And if there has been any Failure as to the expreſs Promiſes of the Publick upon their Bills, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>that</hi> has not been one of the grand Cauſes of the Bills ſinking in their Value, and ſo of all the ſad Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences thereof?</p>
            <p>Furthermore, I think the Governments would do well to enquire, whence it is that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Laſtly, I wiſh the Governments would conſider and enquire, whether there are not ſome Laws wanting to be made, which might in ſome Meaſure relieve the Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and ſtill a great Part of the preſent Cry?

            <p>And now if out honoured Rulers, upon a ſtrict, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, cloſe, and impartial Conſideration of theſe Things, ſhould find that in Years paſt there have been any Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes or Defects in managing the publick Credit, inſtead of caſting ſevere Reflections <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

            <p>What I have further to add here, is, that if upon In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry any Thing be found in the Nature of the Bills paſſing among us, that is the <hi>real,</hi> the <hi>natural,</hi> and the <hi>neceſſary</hi> Cauſe of any of the Oppreſſions that are in the Land, the Governments would do their utmoſt to rectify the ſame: And conſider with themſelves, whether it can poſſibly be conſiſtent with the Rules of Wiſdom, Truth and Juſtice ever to <hi>emit</hi> any more of them. For ought not a Province to make any Shift, rather than ſend forth any more Bills of ſuch a Tenor, as will plainly and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily injure and oppreſs great Part of the Community; that will plunge the whole deeper and deeper into Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, and cauſe the Cry to riſe louder and louder?<note n="*" place="bottom">Since the Preaching theſe Sermons, I find the Governour, in his late excellent Speech to both Houſes of the General Aſſembly, ſets forth the general Diſtreſs of the Province, ariſing from the extraordinary Emiſſions of Paper Money; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Value thereof, for all Occaſions of Life, is ſunk ſo low, and is ſtill ſinking, and thereby the Eſtates of Orphans and Widows, and many others, who have no Remedy in their Power againſt this growing Evil, daily diminiſhing; which muſt, in a very little Time, bring many good Families to Poverty. And upon theſe and other Conſiderations, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e earneſtly recommends to them, to find ſome other Way for the Supply of the Treaſury, than by making new Emiſſions of Paper Money; as the Way to give Relief to the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, who juſtly expect it from them.</note>

            <p>But then it muſt be ſaid,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Cry of Oppreſſion thro' the Land, ariſes very much from the People in general?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>People are very apt to ſhift the Blame off themſelves, and lay it upon others, when perhaps they themſelves are as much or more to blame. The popular Cry is againſt Merchants and Traders, as if they had ruined the Country; or againſt thoſe who are or have been in the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:006090_0042_1027836E77F9F4C0"/>Government: But it ought to be duly conſidered, how much the common People have had a Hand in our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Calamities. And this muſt be acknowledged, that <hi>that very Thing</hi> which has cauſed the Oppreſſion and the Cry, the People in general have been too fond of. The common People have been pleaſed with large Emiſſions of Bills: And as for a Plenty of this Paper Currency, <hi>they loved to have it ſo, not conſidering what they ſhould do in the End thereof.</hi> The People have choſen rather to lay up Debts for their Children in theſe promiſſory Bills, than to pay their Debts themſelves. Nay, Is it not to be feared that many have been wiſhing for Plenty of theſe Bills with this View, that they might <hi>depreciate,</hi> that ſo they might the more eaſily pay their Debts; yea, and to get diſcharged of them by paying for leſs than the honeſt Debt. And in ſome Years paſt, how did the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of the People even drive the Governments into large Emiſſions? And ſince that Time, have not Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of the People been ſo ſet for encreaſing a Paper Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency, that they were ſetting up private Banks in all Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Land; ſome of which could not be eaſily reſtrained, but by the <hi>higher Powers from Home?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And may not the Cry of Oppreſſion be ſo far charged upon the People, as they neglect to fulfil their original Contracts, according to the honeſt Meaning of them, merely becauſe there are no human Laws compelling them to it?</p>
            <p>Moreover, The <hi>Pride,</hi> the <hi>Prodigality,</hi> the <hi>Luxury</hi> and <hi>Extravagance</hi> of this People have had a great Hand in cauſing the Oppreſſion and Cry in the Land.</p>
            <p>And there are a Multitude of other Sins among us; ſuch as horrible Impiety, Profaneneſs and Infidelity. There is an horrible Neglect of God's Day, his Houſe, and his holy Ordinances. <hi>Fear is caſt off, and Prayer is reſtrained before God.</hi> The Land alſo is defiled by <hi>Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:006090_0043_102783718FCBAF98"/>Lying</hi> and <hi>Stealing,</hi> by <hi>Rioting</hi> and <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> by <hi>Chambering</hi> and <hi>Wantonneſs.</hi> Truly we have provoked an holy God very much to depart from us, and to bring us into ſuch ſore Calamities.</p>
            <p>Our Ways have very much diſpleaſed God, and he has ſtirred up our Enemies to be at War againſt us; and this has neceſſarily drawn forth <hi>larger Emiſſions,</hi> and run us into greater Difficulties, and plunged us the deeper into Debt; and the People's riſing upon it in their Demands one upon another, increaſes the Cry of Oppreſſion every Day.</p>
            <p>And ſurely it is Matter of deep Humiliation to think that by one Means and another this is come to be in ſo a conſiderable a Meaſure our wretched Caſe, that is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by the Prophet; <hi>Judgment is turned away back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, Juſtice ſtandeth afar off: Truth is fallen in the Street, and Equity cannot enter: Yea, Truth faileth, and he that departeth from Evil, maketh himſelf a Prey: And the Lord ſaw it, and it diſpleaſed him that there was no Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
               <note n="o" place="bottom">Iſai. lix. 14, 15.</note>. Are we not come, in ſome Meaſure, to ſuch a ſad Paſs as this, that if a Man will depart from Evil, and will honeſtly pay his old Debt to the full Value of the Debt when it was contracted, he maketh himſelf <hi>a Prey,</hi> as he is not able to recover the ſame of others that are indebted to him? <hi>And God ſaw it, and it diſpleaſed him that there was no Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now altho' I have gone into an unuſual Strain, and touch'd upon a Subject uncommon for the Pulpit; yet I hope I ſhall not be thought to have gone out of my Line; for the Occaſion is ſpecial: And the Authority calls <hi>upon Miniſters and People</hi> this Day <hi>to make penitent Confeſſion of their own Sins, and the Sins of this People.</hi> And what more crying Sins in the Land than thoſe of <hi>Injuſtice</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion?</hi> And how can theſe be clearly

            <p n="4">IV. <hi>And now what can this People expect, if we go on in ſuch a Way as this, but that God will deal with us as with his Vineyard of old?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For God is as righteous a Lord as ever: And he loves Righteouſneſs, and hates Iniquity as much as ever: And the Cry of Defrauding and Oppreſſion is as grating in the Ears of the Lord of <hi>Sabaoth</hi> as ever. And if theſe were the Sins that provoked God to give up his Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of old; what can we expect, unleſs we repent, but that he will break down the Wall, and pluck up the Hedge that is round about us? What can we expect, if we go on in this Way, but that he ſhould withdraw the ſpecial Protections of his Providence from our <hi>Charter Privileges,</hi> from our <hi>eccleſiaſtical Liberties</hi> and our <hi>ſecular Intereſts?</hi> So as to lay us open to be devoured by our Enemies of one Sort or another on every Side? <hi>And I will lay it waſte, that it ſhall not be pruned nor digged; but there ſhall come up Briars and Thorns.

            </p>
            <p>God has begun to take us in Hand for our Sins, and the remarkable Judgments of Heaven are upon us. <hi>And if we will not be reformed by theſe Things, but will ſtill walk contrary to God, he will walk contrary to us, and will puniſh us ſeven Times more our Sins<note n="p" place="bottom">Lev. xxvi. 23, 24.</note>.

And if after all we will go on in Ways of Unrighteouſneſs and Impiety, our Ruin will be of ourſelves, and God will have it to charge upon us, as upon his People of old, <hi>O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf.</hi> We ſhall have nothing to ſay, but to upbraid ourſelves for our own Folly and Madneſs, ſaying, How have I hated Inſtruction, and mine Heart depiſed Reproof?

            <p>Now then ſuffer the Word of <hi>Exhortation.</hi> Oh let us all be exhorted to humble ourſelves <hi>this Days,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and turn from all our Tranſgreſſions, that ſo Iniquity may not be our Ruin.</p>
            <p>And let me ſay to the People of this Land, as <hi>Daniel</hi> to the King of <hi>Babylon, Wherefore, O King, let my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel be acceptable to thee, and break off thy Sins by Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and thine Iniquities by ſhewing Mercy to the Poor, if it may be a lengthning out of thy Tranquility</hi>

            <p>Nothing but Repentance and Reformation will turn away God's Anger, that is kindling againſt us. Faſtings and Prayers will by no Means anſwer the End of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Theſe are cheap and eaſy Things compared with
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:006090_0046_1027837B2BB70658"/>Repentance and Reformation. <hi>They ſeek me daily, and delight to know my Ways, as a Nation that did Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> But <hi>to what Purpoſe is the Multitude of your Sacrifices unto me, ſaith the Lord?</hi> O then let us as the Pſalmiſt adviſes, <hi>offer the Sacrifices of</hi> RIGHTEOUSNESS, <hi>and put our Trust in the Lord</hi>

            <p>But then, conſidering our abſolute Dependance upon God for Grace to help in Time of Need, we ought to be much in Prayer, both private and publick.

            <p>And ſince we are expreſly directed, let us pray for a <hi>publick Spirit</hi> to <hi>all Perſons</hi> whatſoever, and eſpecially to thoſe in <hi>civil Government:</hi> I was much pleaſed with that Article in the Proclamation; for it is a good Sign when Rulers are ſo ſenſible of the Neceſſity of <hi>this</hi> as to call upon all to pray that it may be poured out upon <hi>them,</hi> and upon <hi>others.</hi> And it is to be feared, that the Want of this Spirit has been the Cauſe of moſt of our Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
            <p>Perſon of a publick Spirit are the only Perſons fit for publick Stations.

            <p>Oh then let us cry mightily to God this Day, and every Day, for our Rulers, that a publick Spirit may be given to them, and reſt upon them; and that they may, in all their publick Concerns, act under the Influence of ſuch a Spirit.

            <p>Moreover, Let us pray that all the People may put on a publick Spirit, that they may have an Eye to the publick Good, and be willing to ſuffer in their private Intereſts to promote the publick Weal.</p>
