            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <argument>
               <head>Introduction, or the Preface.</head>
               <p>GIVE audience all ye people, hear my words, O ye wiſe men, give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge; for the ear tryeth words, as the mouth taſteth meat: Hear me therefore, O ye mothers in Iſrael, and children, and depart not from the words of my mouth.</p>
               <p>Suffer me a little and I will ſhew you that I have yet to ſpeak in behalf of God and my country.</p>
               <p>But firſt I have an apology to make to the reverend doctors of divinity and others who may diſpute my authority to undertake a matter of ſuch im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe importance; being one of <hi>Zebulun,</hi> or of the ſea-fareing tribe, whoſe calling is upon the mighty waters, quite remote from the royal prieſthood.</p>
               <p>To ſuch I anſwer with the language of Elibu the ſon of Barachel the Buzite, when he waited for an anſwer from riper age, to reprove Job; I thought days ſhould ſpeak, and multitude of years teach wiſdom; but when I had waited, they ſpake not, but ſtood ſtill, and anſwered no more: Then I tho't I would anſwer my part by ſhewing my opinion; for I am full of matter, and the ſpirit within me conſtraineth me to ſhew my opinion, morally, as I am no Dr. of divinity; yet am I a dear lover of morality, in its cleareſt ſhining light, being deſtitute of which, no man can make any pretenſions to that which is divine.— And without intruding upon gentlemen of that holy order, I ſhall proceed to ſpeak to the words ſelected out of ſacred hiſtory for our preſent entertainment; —Which you may find written,
<q>
                     <bibl>EXODUS, xxxii chap. 7th &amp; 8th verſes,</bibl>
                     <p>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, get thee down, for thy people which thou broughteſt out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themſelves; they have turned aſide quickly out of the way which I commanded them, they have made a molten calf, and have worſhipped it, and ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thereunto, and ſaid, theſe be thy gods O Iſrael, which have bro't thee up out of the land of Egypt.</p>
                  </q>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>IN ſpeaking unto which words, I ſhall enquire into and explain the words of the text in regard to primitive times, and compare the time
<pb facs="unknown:009929_0004_0F7B3BF8B4B86A08"/>
preſent with them, to ſee how nearly they agree in regard to moral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and draw a few inferences from both, and apply them to your ſerious conſideration; and conclude with a word or two of advice to all concerned in affairs of immenſe importance. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. My brethren it would be tautology in me to rehearſe the hiſtory of the patriarch Moſes to you, knowing you, or moſt of you to be the children of pious parents, well educated, and bro't up in the fear of the Lord, as I look upon none of you to be ignorant of the birth, child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and education of him; you have read, and your parents have told you the many wonders wrought by Moſes, in bringing his brethren out of the land of Egypt, and out of the houſe of bondage, (he being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with a ſtrong and ſincere regard for the Iſraelites, and pity for all under that heavy yoke) how that in honour, truth and fidelity, he led his countrymen until he came to Mount Sinai, where he was called of God up into the Mount, and commenced lawgiver from the King of kings; and as this is the higheſt pitch of honor that can be conferred upon man, I ſhall omit ſaying any more of the patriarch Moſes, but enquire into what happened in his abſence from the people.</p>
            <p>Moſes, in his abſence, left the care of the people to Aaron, for their guide: The poor people miſſing their firſt leader, little tho't he was gone their prime miniſter to the King of kings, and was conſulting for their everlaſting welfare: Being ignorant of this, they aſked Aaron to make them gods to go before them, for they didn't know what became of the man that bro't them out of the land of Egypt.</p>
            <p>Aaron being fond of government, and not having the fear of God before his eyes, he yielded to the people's requeſt, made a calf, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped and ſacrificed thereunto; which is the corruption ſpoken of in my text, which kindled the anger of the Lord to ſpeak unto Moſes in the manner he did, when in the mount, ſaying, Get thee down, &amp;c. as in the text.</p>
            <p>My brethren, having found the author and finiſher of the calf, let us enquire into the manner of their worſhipping and ſacrificing thereunto, in regard to which, I don't conceive that they had any ſet modes of worſhip, as at this day, for being left of God's teacher, they fell into all manner of error and confuſion, ſinging and dancing round their molten clalf, or calves (Indian like) proclaiming, <hi>Theſe be thy Gods, O Iſrael.</hi> This was the noiſe which Joſhua heard, coming with Moſes out of the mount, he ſaid, <hi>It is not the voice of them which ſhout for maſtery, neither is it the voice of them that cry for being over-come, but the noiſe of them that ſing, do I hear.</hi> This was their way of worſhip, and their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was much worſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:009929_0005_0F7B3BF94EB88248"/>
               <hi>Every man brake off the golden ear-rings, which were in their own or their wives and childrens ears, and bro't them unto Aaron, and Aaron received them at their hands, and faſhioned it with a graving tool; and after he had finiſhed the calf, he built an alter, and proclaimed a feaſt to the Lord, and the people brought burnt offerings and peace offerings, ſat down to eat and drink, and aroſe up to play.</hi> Thus they went on until Aaron had ſtripped them of every thing valuable, and made them naked to their ſhame among their enemies.—But Moſes drew near unto the camp, ſaw their unwarrantable proceeding; he ſaw the calf and the dance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and his anger waxed hot; and he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire (perhaps a ſacred bon-fire which they were danceing round) ready made, as I don't read that Moſes kindled a fire for the purpoſe; and when he had burnt the calf, he ground it to powder, and ſtrowed it upon the water. Our text informs us that this corruption happen'd ſuddenly, and contrary to God's command, which cauſed many plagues to fall upon the people, (which I ſhall not take notice of at preſent, as time would fail me): Therefore I muſt haſten to compare the times preſent with the former. And</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. Can we find a Moſes in this evil day which we live in? I anſwer, an equal to Moſes upon, all accounts, is not to be found on earth, but yet we may find a man of a true patriarch ſpirit, who may reſemble him in many things. And I think we may dare to nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſecretary PITT to be our Moſes, every way qualified, morally, as Moſes was, to lead a people; being endow'd with honor, love, truth and fidelity; and in knowledge of things appertaining to this day, Pitt muſt exceed Moſes, (as Moſes is not, neither doth any man know of his ſepulchre to this day.)</p>
            <p>However, Pitt was our prime miniſter, under whoſe miniſtry we flouriſhed; he was the planner of every operation in time of war, which proved ſucceſsful to us in theſe American wilds: When he was at the helm our country-ſhip was well ſteared; the hearts of the people were made glad, and rejoiced in ſongs of victory and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over their barbarous and ſavage enemies, the Indians, and their aſſociates, the French natives of Canada, and the borders adjacent: By the bleſſing of God, and Pitt's ſuperior knowledge and prudent management of affairs in America, the howling wilderneſs was ſtopped in immenſe ſilence; and a period was put to the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humane maſſacres, which was ſo frequently heard of amongſt us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:009929_0006_0F7B3BF9D1926DA8"/>Thus the dark, gloomy, melancholly ſcenes were over, and every thing ſeemed to appear with a ſmiling aſpect in all quarters of the world, as well as in North-America. Thus ſecretary PITT, taking Moſes of old for his example, conducted gloriouſly, which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down to his honour in ages to come.—But O poor Americans, thy friend being fatigued with the noiſe of a corrupt ſet of people, left the helm to the ſteerage of E—l B—e, who is an emblem of the primitive Aaron, leading the people into all manner of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; as I ſhall indeavour to demonſtrate by what happened ſoon afterwards: For as Aaron led the people into corruption ſoon after Moſes went into the Mount, ſo B—e is ſaid to lead the people into miſchief, (ſoon after Pitt leaves the helm) by his bad ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>No ſooner B—e takes hold of the helm but there is a wide dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in government, every action which ſhould tend to promote the freedom of Britons, is moſt notoriouſly made uſe of to enſlave and plague them.</p>
            <p>What happens to us in this day, may be ſaid to be worſe than Egyptian bondage, for the Hebrews had nothing to ſubſiſt upon, of their own, while in bondage, and therefore could expect nothing but to labour hard for a livelihood: But with us my brethren, it is not ſo; for we had won by conqueſt, and had great things in poſſeſſion. But alas! what we ſeemed to have is taken away from us, and gave to the enemies of Britain—all the conqueſt and victories gained in the Weſt-Indies, which were of an immenſe value, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the free cod fiſhery; (which was of as much or more conſequence to them than their Romiſh creed; for without fiſh they could not perform the articles of their belief); all this and more, given up to the nations which waged war againſt us, in a time when we were under no obligations to make peace with, (on any terms) much leſs inſignificant ones.</p>
            <p>I ſay given up without any valuable conſideration, for mere no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that I can ſuggeſt, but only to have it ſaid by our enemies that ſlavery becomes Britons more than the enemies to Britain: (who it was that ſo craftily befriended the Romiſh eſtabliſhment it's hard for any one to ſay; but I am well aſſured that ſecretary Pitt had but little or no hand in it; ſuffer me to tell you, that the whole
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009929_0007_0F7B3BFA8D672700"/>
weſtern world feels the effects of the maugre terms of peace); I call them maugre, becauſe we are like to be ſtarved and cut ſhort of allowance by the means—See impoſition upon impoſition is crowded upon us; and to crown all corruption, the ST—PM—N is coming among us, who is an emblem of the molten calf, made by Aaron of old in the wilderneſs; ſee the manner of his coming, and the errand come upon, and you will join with me in ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that he is the beaſt ſpoken of in my text, and whoſoever worſhips or ſacrifices unto him will be brought to nakedneſs and ſhame, as the Hebrews was of old.</p>
            <p>The criticks will perhaps quere, How a man can be an emblem of a beaſt? To ſuch I anſwer, That I don't mean in bodily ſhape, but he may be ſaid to be like unto a beaſt by having a beaſtly diſpoſition; as indecency, ingratitude, &amp;c. is ſaid to be brutiſh (in man): and we read
<q>That man in honour abiding not, is like the beaſt that periſh.</q>
If this be true, this very identical St—pm-n was choſen repr—ive to this colony, he was honour'd and prefer'd before any of his function, he was ſent on an important errand to England; his grand deſign and buſineſs was to preſent the colony's humble thanks to the king and parliament, &amp;c. of Great-Britain, for their paternal care over us in the late war, and thankfully to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge every inſtance of favour received from them by the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony; alſo to repreſent the true ſtate of the conſtitution of the government; and to make known the extreme poverty which we were reduced to by the calamities of a long war, and our inability of making a meet reſtitution for their goodneſs at preſent (any more than as dutiful ſubjects ought, ſo do we, poſſeſs hearts full of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.)</p>
            <p>He alſo was to pray for the continuation of our rights and liberties, as at the firſt, and for the ſecurity of our properties as at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, without the leaſt encroachment on our charter: But my bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, upon his arrival in Europe, he inhumanly forgot the place of his nativity, and (as it is laid) moſt ungratefully betrayed the liberty of his country; and for the ſake of a poſt in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of no great value, he commenced executioner to the death warrant of it. As Eliphaz ſaid to Job,
<q>Should a wiſe man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the eaſt wind.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:009929_0008_0F7B3BFB4F165DA0"/>Surely my brethren, the ear of that eaſtern world had a great effect upon him, his belly being filled with the eaſt wind, puffed him up with pride and arrogancy, that he thought himſelf and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen rich as Caeſar, forgetting the important errand of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment's humble addreſs; uttering ſwelling words of vain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, when in company with the B—efy'd gentry, ſaying, that the colony was able to bare taxation, &amp;c. joined with them in kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his country, and commenced executioner himſelf, to ſerve his countrymen, as he ſays. (But as executioner you muſt mind) O coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try kill country, O calf, beaſt, and antidote againſt liberty. For it is not poſſible that he can be the man which was choſen to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent our cauſe, and plead for our freedom; but thou art the beaſt that is returned with a yoke of bondage to put upon our necks, ſaying we are able to bear all this and more, uttering ſwelling words of vain knowledge, by miſrepreſentations and wrong calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, filling our papers full of the confuſion and noiſe of the brute.</p>
            <p>Inſtead of coming home with anſwers of peace, lenity and good will towards us, he comes inhumanly with a variety of ſt—p duties, and very deeply laden'd with impoſitions upon us, proclaiming ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, ſacrifice unto me, according to the decree paſt, bring your ſilver and your gold, (for I know not the paper money of your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony); if you are deſtitute of hard money, you muſt bring the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancy of your colony. O daughters of Connecticut, you muſt ſacrifice your gold beads, jewels, ear-rings, &amp;c. until you are made bare and naked to your ſhame (for the beaſt's ſake) for the calf or ſt—pm-n will make ſterling of all.</p>
            <p>O <hi>Connecticut, Connecticut,</hi> where is your charter boaſted of for ages paſt (if the beaſt is worſhipped your charter is void) and the government put upon the beaſt's ſhoulder (who is an ill bred beaſt nurſed and brought up to devour you) which muſt be acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by every friend to liberty and property.</p>
            <p>By comparing, I find the times preſent to be in ſome meaſure parallel with the former, if there is any difference it is againſt us, we being more impoſed upon than our fathers.</p>
            <p>I muſt proceed to draw a few inferences from what has been ſaid.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb facs="unknown:009929_0009_0F7B3BFC84138888"/>Iſt. From what we have heard we may learn the humane frailty of man, and when I am exclaiming againſt others, I do not excuſe my ſelf, for I am ſubject to many; we not only learn the humane frailty of man, but alſo the folly of laying too much ſtreſs or dependance on his conduct: Applied to this colony, hath it not been the caſe in regard to the St—pm-n? I hope not entirely ſo: if it hath been the caſe, I don't wonder that he proves a curſe to us rather than a bleſſing;
<q>For it is written, curſed is man that truſteth in man, and that maketh fleſh his arm.</q>
But leaſt I ſhould go beyond my ſphere I muſt ſtick to morality.</p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p n="2">IIdly, We may learn from the train of impoſitions received from the mother country, the folly in glorying in the roaſt beef of Old England, ſince we are ſo notoriouſly flog'd with the ſpit: A little ſupe-maugre with contentment, is preferable to roaſt beef and plumb pudding, ſince we are like to pay ſo dear for the roaſt.</p>
            <p>For being called Engliſhmen without having the privileges of Engliſhmen, is like unto a man in a gibbet, with dainties ſet before him, which would refreſh him and ſatisfy his craving appetite<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if he could come at them, but being debarr'd of that privilege, they only ſerve for an aggravation to his hunger.</p>
            <p>O my poor brethren in the gibbet of America, that cannot come at the dainties of Europe, I pity you with all my heart and ſoul.</p>
            <p n="3">IIIdly, Have we learn'd that corruption is at the helm, and that our country ſhip is badly ſteered? This alſo teaches us that the watch muſt be called and the helm relieved by a better man.</p>
            <p>O PITT, is it your watch upon deck? (turn out) take the helm from B—e, for he hath nigh over ſet us at times: he hath carried ſuch taught ſail in the ſquals of impoſitions that our ſails are wore thread-bare: See the hurricane of ſtamp duties coming on, ſhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſail timely, down with top-gallant-maſt, yards and ſails of pride and vain glory, in with all ſmall kites, and ſee every thing ſnug to ſtand the ſtorm, like a bold ſeaman, (bend new courſes to the yards) and for God's ſake don't lay us a-troy, for we have been tried ſufficiently. If the gale comes on very hard put before the wind, for the ſafety of the ſhip and our lives. Scud her manfully
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:009929_0010_0F7B3BFCEEA521B0"/>
until the pernicious gale is over and the mountainous ſea of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption is ran down, or is broken to pieces by a gentle breeze of liberty, ariſing to refreſh our wearied ſouls, which have been ſo long fatigued with the thoughts of approaching ſlavery.</p>
            <p n="4">IVthly, Have we found a calf to be ſacrificed to, in this our day? Let us all, every living ſoul here preſent, or that lives with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the precinct, or of hearing the noiſe of the beaſt, take example by that worthy patriarch Moſes of old, and make a ſacrifice of the calf, rather than to ſacrifice thereunto—Burn it in the fire, grind it to powder, and ſtrow it upon the ocean, that the fi<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>y nautiouſneſs of the beaſt may be cleanſed from the earth, and that our plagues and impoſitions may not be made wonderful.</p>
            <p>Time would fail to tell you of Shadrech, Meſhach and Abed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nego in the fiery furnace, Daniel in the lion's den, and many other worthies, who have been faithful in bearing teſtimony againſt unjuſt decrees, &amp;c. and have been protected by heaven in it their cauſe being juſt in the ſight of God. For wo unto them that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree unrighteous decrees. My brethren, fear not the face of man, in regard to juſtice and equity: Keep truth of your ſide, let the world do what they will: I ſpeak freely unto you all, for I am not afraid, if I looſe my head, I cannot looſe my gown or caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſock.</p>
            <p>A word or two of advice to all concerned in this affair of grand importance, and I have done.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, my brethren, my advice to you is, to fear God above all things, honour and love the King and his friends, deteſt and loath his enemies, eſpecially his private ones: If you ſee or hear of any corruption in his miniſtry, bear teſtimony againſt it; for it is treaſon in ſubjects for to keep ſilent when they ſee their prince diſhonour'd; and if by wrong repreſentations of any corrupt perſon or perſons his ſubjects become grieved, impoveriſhed or cut ſhort of their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty or privileges, let ſuch ſubjects make known their grievance that they may be relieved, for whatſoever tends to the poverty of ſubjects, by means of the enemies to freedom, is a diſgrace to a monarch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For poor ſubjects cannot make a rich king.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:009929_0011_0F7B3BFD8FA19258"/>O freemen of the colony of Connecticut! ſtand faſt in the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties granted you by your royal charter.</p>
            <p>Plead the injuſtice of any that means to infringe upon you, by curtailing the rights and privileges once given you freely, without any deſign to take them from you again (without your conduct could be deem'd rebellious): and my opinion is, that it cannot be counted rebelling, for the freemen of this colony to ſtand for their abſolute rights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and defend them (as a man would his own houſe when inſulted): For I ſee no difference in regard to the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of either, whether it be by deed of gift or deed of ſale.— Therefore, if any man in this colony, hath, for the ſake of filthy lucre, miſrepreſented matters, ſo that ye are grieved, or are like to be cut ſhort of the privileges enjoyed for many years paſt.</p>
            <p>Go, one and all, go to ſuch a man, and make him ſenſible of his error, if he will be convinced of his folly (forgive him) but if he wilfully perſiſts in his wickedneſs, uſe him in ſuch a manner that he will be glad to conform to the truth; and if he is in any poſt that unjuſtly grinds the face of the poor, or that contributes to your ſlavery, aſk him peaceably to reſign it, and if he refuſes to, uſe him in ſuch a manner that he will be glad to do any thing for a quiet life, For Britons never muſt be ſlaves. And as we read, that
<q>he which being often reproved, hardeneth his neck ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy,</q>
Therefore take care of Mr. St—pm-n, alias the molten calf. AMEN.</p>
