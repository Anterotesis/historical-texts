            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>GOD is known, in a meaſure, to all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, by the judgments which he exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuteth in all the earth; and hath direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to remember that we magnify his work which men behold.</p>
            <p>And though we the off-ſpring of God, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his fatherly direction, cannot by ſearching find out the ALMIGHTY unto perfection; yet by a careful attention to the works of creation and providence, God's hand in both, is clearly ſeen.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:015279_0004_0F9882C83B77C0"/>
But our own observation is limited by the short term of human life, and admits only of small im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements: it is, therefore, by comparing our own imperfect experience, with the information we receive from those who have passed the stage of action before us, that we gain a more compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive view of Divine conduct towards mankind. And succeeding ages may receive additional light in the ways of God, by a faithful testimony of the LORD's doings in our times.</p>
            <p>We will not, therefore, hide them from our children, but shew the generations to come, the praises of the Lord—his strength and the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works that he hath done.</p>
            <p>This is the special end of our religious assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly this day.</p>
            <p>And notwithstanding dark intervening clouds, we have yet just cause, cordially to join in that divine Anthem of praise:—THE LORD REIGNETH, LET THE EARTH REJOICE.</p>
            <p>But though the voice of nature and reason is sufficient to render all men inexcusable, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ignorant of Divine superintendence; yet it is by the sacred scriptures, given by inspiration from the Father of lights, that the paths of Divine Providence are more clearly laid open before us, and we are assured, both of the unlimited extent, and rectitude of God's government.</p>
            <p>And I think we may safely presume, that the Divine conduct towards the people of Israel, in their various connections, so minutely recorded, is designed to represent the general course of God's
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015279_0005_0F9882C90147F8F0"/>
Providence, in all ages of the world. For God is the ſame, and changeth not.</p>
            <p>Unleſs we admit this ſuppoſition, the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical part of the old teſtament muſt appear leſs profitable to us for correction and inſtruction in righteouſneſs. But if conſidered as written prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally with this view, that part of God's holy word may indeed, be a light to our feet and a lamp to our path.</p>
            <p>We are here taught in particular, the interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Divine Providence, in wars and fightings among men, which proceed immediately from their brutal luſts; and are aſſured that he to whom vengeance belongeth, has not failed, to repay the loſſes—and innocent blood wantonly ſhed by ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors, in theſe accurſed conflicts. Thus in the inſtance before us;</p>
            <p>The righteous Judge among the nations, having determined, in his juſt diſpleaſure, to obliterate the name of the deſtroyer of his people, enjoined his ſervant Moſes, to enter his righteous purpoſe upon their records, that it might be tranſmitted to all ſucceeding generations—as a terror to evil doers, and ſupport to the oppreſſed: As in our text, which I ſhall repeat.</p>
            <p>"And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearſe it in the ears of Joſhua, for I will put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.</p>
            <p>And Moſes built an altar, and called the name of it JEHOVAH-NISSI.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:015279_0006_0F9882C9BAC4EC00"/>
For he ſaid, becauſe the Lord hath ſworn, that the Lord will have war with Amalek, from gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to generation."</p>
            <p>Several things are obſervable in theſe words, taken in their connection, which are applicable to the preſent occaſion: As,</p>
            <p>1ſt. The unjuſt and cruel attack, made by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malekites, upon the camp of Iſrael.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid v. 8, Then came Amalek, and ſought with Iſrael.</p>
            <p>That this war was unjuſt on the part of Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lek, is implied in the puniſhment threatned by the Supreme Judge, and is alſo evident from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which attended it.</p>
            <p>The Iſraelites, miraculouſly delivered from Egyptian bondage, were now beginning their march towards the promiſed land—incumbred with their families—the infant—the aged, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm—their numerous flocks and herds, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of every kind; and ſo muſt be in a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion very unfit for defence, and utterly unprepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for an offenſive war.</p>
            <p>This incumbred camp, was expoſed as an eaſy prey to an armed force: and it muſt be ſuppoſed that the Amalekites, made this cruel attack with the ſordid view of plunder.</p>
            <p>From this inſatiable luſt of unrighteous gain, wars and fightings—deſtruction and bloodſhed, from the beginning, have ariſen, in all ages and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:015279_0007_0F9882CA8127F1B8"/>
countries, ſo that from a paradiſe, this earth, and particularly our land, is become a field of blood!</p>
            <p>Amalek was not of the number of the nations, whoſe land Iſrael, by a divine grant, was now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to poſſeſs, which probably they might know, from the public declarations made by God to his people, from the days of Abraham; therefore they could not plead their own future ſecurity in juſtification of this horrid act of violence.</p>
            <p>If we ſhould ſuppoſe, this rapacious band was invited—urged, and even conducted, by ſome abandoned Iſraelites, who expected to be ſharers in the plunder of their brethren: Alaſs! the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition may be juſtified, by too many flagrant inſtances in our times, and even at <hi>this day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tell it not in Gath!</hi>—</p>
            <p>But however this was, we are aſſured, the war on the part of the aggreſſors, was unjuſt and a dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affront offered to the God of the armies of Iſrael, under whoſe immediate banner, they were peaceably marching to their promiſed reſt.</p>
            <p>And it appears that this daring violence was attended with daſtardly cruelty and ſavage bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity: Their attack was not with martial brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in face of day; but made by a ſkulking am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcade, and upon that part of the camp leaſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of defence.</p>
            <p>Thus it is ſaid, Deut. xxv, 17, "Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way when ye were come forth out of Egypt, how he met thee by the way, and ſmote the hindermoſt of thee, even all
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015279_0008_0F9882CB3A996F30"/>
that were feeble behind thee, when thou waſt faint and weary, and feared not God."</p>
            <p>It is not of importance, that we know the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of this accurſed people, whoſe latter end, has long ſince periſhed, from the earth.</p>
            <p>The ſacred hiſtory leads us to ſuppoſe them to be a branch of the family of Eſau, which was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the ſtock of the Edomites, and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a diſtinct ſtate, or rather band of robbers, under duke Amalek mentioned Gen. xxxvi. 16. Amalek is there ſaid v. 12, to be the ſon of the concubine of Eliphaz, who was Eſan's ſon; and from him probably, this devoted people derived their name.<note n="*" place="bottom">See alſo I Chron. i. 36.</note> But however this may be, their name only remains, as a monument of God's juſt indignation againſt the people who delight in war.</p>
            <p>Which leads us to obſerve from the words,</p>
            <p>IIdly. The manifeſt tokens of God's righteous diſpleaſure, againſt the Amalekites, for their vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence offered to Iſrael.</p>
            <p>"The righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs," and his ſoul "abhorreth the bloody and deceitful man." "Vengeance is mine, I will repay ſaith the Lord."</p>
            <p>This was, in part, immediately executed, by the hand of Joſhua, and the choſen bands of Iſrael, who it is ſaid, "diſcomfited Amalek with the edge of the ſword." Yet a day of full recompence is here threatned, when God will pour out his wrath upon them to the uttermoſt, and blot out the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Amalek from under Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:015279_0009_0F9882CCAE0FABF8"/>
And we may here join with the Angel of the waters, Rev. xvi. 5, and ſay, "Thou art righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous O Lord—becauſe Thou haſt judged thus. For they have ſhed the blood of thy ſervants and thou haſt given them blood to drink, for they are worthy."</p>
            <p>For though God, who at one view comprehends all events, over-rules the ſinful actions of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent beings, ſo as to accompliſh the wiſe purpoſes of his providence and grace; yet this doth not, in any degree, extenuate their guilt, nor free the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner from threatned puniſhment.</p>
            <p>God, the ſupreme ruler, ſtrictly requires obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to his laws, which are all like their Divine Author, holy, juſt, wiſe and good.</p>
            <p>Sin is a tranſgreſſion of the law of God; and as, contrary to his nature and will, He muſt behold all ſin and ſinners, in that character, with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt abhorrence. And God in no other ſenſe can be ſaid to permit ſin, but this only; that he doth not by his power, interpoſe, to reſtrain the ſinner from the commiſſion of it.</p>
            <p>Can it then, from this, be juſtly inferred? or will any weak arrogant mortal preſume to aſſert, that a being of infinite purity, is the author or efficient cauſe of the ſins, and even murders, men commit?—GOD FORBID!—</p>
            <p>God, the common Father of mankind, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, from the beginning, guarded the lives of men, by an expreſs law, enforced with this awful ſanction—"Whoſo ſheddeth man's blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed."—And to ſtrike the greater
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015279_0010_0F9882CCC02C9610"/>
awe; it is added, "for in the image of God made he him."</p>
            <p>God thus, in the plaineſt manner, expreſſes his utter abhorrence of the unnatural crime of murder in every inſtance. War, on the part of aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, is a bold attempt to murder with peculiar aggravations. "Every battle of the warrior is with confuſed noiſe and garments rolled in blood."—Here men are often murdered by thouſands, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtinction of character—age—or ſex.</p>
            <p>Shall not a righteous God, and tender Father viſit for theſe things, ſhall not his ſoul be avenged on ſuch a nation at this?</p>
            <p>And God to whom vengeance belongeth, hath in this caſe, entruſted man, in part, with the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it.</p>
            <p>Thoſe words:—"Whoſo ſheddeth man's blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed", are not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a bare permiſſion, but a poſitive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, obliging all to endeavour to cut off thoſe inhuman monſters from the earth.</p>
            <p>This renders it evident, that a defenſive war is not only lawful, but ſpecially enjoined by the Lord of Hoſts, when other means fail to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſecurity.</p>
            <p>It is then according to the prayer of Solomon, 2 Chron. vi. 34. That a people go out to war againſt their enemies, by the way that God will ſend them: with a view to execute the divine law, in cutting off men of blood. And where the laws of civil ſociety do not extend, the ſword of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015279_0011_0F9882CD8026F0C0"/>
juſtice, in the hands of men, in every other way, is borne in vain.</p>
            <p>And thus Moſes, in the inſtance before us, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected Joſhua, to "chooſe out men, and go fight with Amalek." And in like inſtances, a curſe is denounced againſt the man that withholdeth his hand from ſhedding blood—and even on him that doth this work of the Lord negligently. This indeed, is not to be done, in any inſtance, merely from a ſpirit of revenge, but as acting under a divine warrant, to take away the life forfeited into the hands of God.</p>
            <p>Shocking thought!—That ſo many of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man race, who are all of one blood, and amply provided for by their common parent, ſhould thus, from paſſion—pride—luſt of gain—and lawleſs dominion—render themſelves a curſe to the world, and be accurſed of God and man.</p>
            <p>And though few comparatively, in any age, among the moſt uncultivated of mankind, have ſo far loſt all feelings of humanity, as openly to juſtify private murders; yet frequent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are not wanting, among collective bodies, or nations profeſſing civility, and even chriſtianity, who glory in public ſlaughters; and arrogantly boaſt of their power, to trample under feet the lives and liberties of their fellow mortals, and wantonly ſport in their deſtruction.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Burgoyne's letter to Tom:—on the deſtruction of Charleſtown.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But though hand join in hand, yet ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſeleſs workers of iniquity ſhall not always go unpuniſhed. He that is higher than the higheſt
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015279_0012_0F9882CE3B830BE0"/>
of men regardeth. The Lord is a man of war, the Lord is his name. He breaketh the bows of the mighty men; and they who are girded with ſtrength ſtumble and fall. As he did Amalek, the God of armies will ſcatter the people that delight in war.</p>
            <p>IIIdly, We may here obſerve; that Moſes aſcribes to God the glory of their preſent deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and confides in the divine promiſe of fully avenging their wrongs, perpetrated by cruel op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſors.</p>
            <p>It is here ſaid, "Moſes built an altar and called the name of it JEHOVAH-NISSI, (i. e. the Lord my banner.) For he ſaid, becauſe the Lord hath ſworn, that the Lord will have war with Amalek from generation to generation."</p>
            <p>Salvation is of the Lord, and whoever are the inſtruments of our ſafety, we muſt religiouſly aſcribe the glory and victory to the Lord of Hoſts, the ſhield of our defence, and great deliverer.</p>
            <p>Moſes had now nothing more to fear from this inſidious foe, ſince the God of armies, had eſpouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their cauſe: and though the great ſhepherd of Iſrael deferred the final execution of his wrath againſt their enemies, for many generations; yet through faith in the promiſe, this man of God, could devoutly ſacrifice on his altar of praiſe, as ſeeing him who is inviſible.—If God be for us, who can be againſt us?</p>
            <p>In his diſpenſations toward public ſocieties, eſpecially, as in the preſent inſtance—God is ſaid to viſit the iniquity of the fathers upon the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015279_0013_0F9882CEFA894A60"/>
in ſucceeding generations: but this infers no impeachment of divine juſtice, or veracity: as this extends to thoſe children only, who tread in the wicked ſteps of their forefathers, and ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their evil deeds, and become partners in their guilt. Of this character was the generation of the Jews in our Saviours day, of whom he ſays, by their own cruel murders, they juſtly brought upon themſelves the guilt and puniſhment of all the innocent blood, ſhed by their forefathers.</p>
            <p>And thus frequent mention is made, in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred hiſtory, of Amalek, in following ages, as confederate with other nations, in their wars againſt Iſrael, which is an evidence, that at the time of the utter deſtruction of that people, they periſhed, in their own perſonal guilt, and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly for their fathers crimes.</p>
            <p>IVthly and Laſtly, We may obſerve in the words, the direction given by God to Moſes, to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate the remembrance of theſe things.</p>
            <p>"And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearſe it in the ears of Joſhua."</p>
            <p>Joſhua in particular as Captain of the hoſt, and even the whole congregation were fully acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this tragical event, it was even impreſſed on their hearts, in characters of blood!</p>
            <p>But God requires his wonderful works, both of mercy and judgment, to be ſought out, kept in mind, and faithfully tranſmitted to ſucceeding generations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:015279_0014_0F9882CFBB544B20"/>
Impreſſions made by the moſt ſtriking events are impaired by time, unleſs renewed by repeated reflection: And faithful records, are the only ſure conveyance of paſt events to poſterity: hereby the dealings of God with the fathers, are made known to their deſcendants, after they have been for ages ſilent in the duſt.</p>
            <p>Moſes therefore, by divine command publiſhed the events of that important day for a memorial, both to the preſent and after generations—Not merely as hiſtorical facts, or for amuſement, but to promote practical godlineſs; in the following inſtances.</p>
            <p>Firſt, This memorial would forever tend to excite the praiſe of that people to God for his mercy to them, in that day of diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>God ſuffered a cruel enemy, unawares to invade the camp of Iſrael, thus unprepared for defence; but yet with an eye of tenderneſs, beheld their helpleſs ſtate—and animated, and ſucceeded his people, in repelling the violence of their foes; and though ſome fell victims to their rage, he cauſed the remainder of their wrath to praiſe his great NAME.</p>
            <p>And this deliverance is included in that ſong of praiſe, uttered many ages following. See Pſal. cxxiv. "if it had not been the Lord who was on our ſide may Iſrael now ſay—When men roſe up againſt us, then had they ſwallowed us up quick—when their wrath was kindled againſt us—then the proud waves had gone over our ſoul—Bleſſed be the Lord, who hath not given us a prey to their teeth."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:015279_0015_0F9882D07B5C78E0"/>
Secondly, Again, the memory of the diſtreſſes of that day would tend, in all ages, to the humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation of this God's covenant people.</p>
            <p>Public calamities, though brought upon a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by the hands of wicked and unreaſonable men, may always be conſidered, as divine correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for prevailing ſins.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid, v. 3, "the people murmured":—Then came Amalek and fought with Iſrael."</p>
            <p>Iſrael was now called by God, to take up arms againſt violent men; and, at the ſame time, by this awakening providence, manifeſtly called to deep humiliation for their vile ingratitude, in murmuring againſt Moſes, and in effect againſt God.</p>
            <p>And the ſame ſucceſſive civil ſociety, when they read their fathers public diſtreſſes, might be aſſured, that their ways were diſpleaſing to God; and thereby receive inſtruction, to walk more circumy ſpectly and humbly before the Lord.</p>
            <p>And in this ſenſe we may conſiſtently under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the confeſſions of this people, frequently made before God, not only of their own ſins, but alſo of the ſins of their fathers. See Pſal. cvi.—"We have ſinned with our fathers, we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted iniquity—Our fathers underſtood not thy wonders in Egypt, they remembered not the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of thy mercies"—"They ſang his praiſe, they ſoon forgat his works, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This written memorial, was deſigned for an evidence, when the deſtruction of the Amale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites ſhould be fully executed, that it was from
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015279_0016_0F9882D13ABE96E8"/>
God, and a juſt puniſhment, for the part they had acted in this cruel war.</p>
            <p>God, for wiſe reaſons, was pleaſed to defer the final execution of this terrible threatning for near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the ſpace of four hundred years; and then to employ his injured people in the ezecution of it. And they might otherwiſe have been induced to aſcribe the victory to themſelves.</p>
            <p>But Got, by this record, gave full information, to all ſueceeding ages, that the war was his—That in the deſtruction of Amalek, he was making in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition for blood, and that his right hand and Holy arm gave the victory.</p>
            <p>Though the long-ſuffering of God, is often ſhewn towards men of blood: yet he never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets their cruelty to his people. For "thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts," 1 Sam. xv, 2. "I remember that which Amalek did to Iſrael, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt."</p>
            <p>Fourthly, The memorial of this event, would teach individuals the vanity of all earthly proſpects.—</p>
            <p>As a people, the children of Iſrael had a never failing promiſe of the land of Canaan, and each one had raiſed expectations of being, in a ſhort time, fixed in the full and quiet poſſeſſion of their portion of it.</p>
            <p>But alaſs! a number were here, by the hand of violence, ſuddenly cut off in their paſſage, and their expectation periſhed from the earth.</p>
            <p>And thus have we, with the moſt tender ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, in the courſe of this baleful war, ſeen the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:015279_0017_0F9882D2013E67B8"/>
riſing hopes of particular perſons and families, in this place, and through the land, in a moment deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Fifthly. Once more, This memorial, would na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally lead this people, in all future conflicts, to repoſe their truſt in the God of the armies of Iſrael. Paſt experience of divine aid, gives energy to faith and prayer and fortitude in the day of battle: For God is the ſame, and his mercy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth forever.</p>
            <p>And this ſevere threatning, confirmed "by an oath, that the Lord, will have war with Amalek from gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to generation" manifeſts God's utter abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all offenſive wars; and alſo implies, a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral promiſe to Iſrael, and every like injured people, throughout all ages, of ſuccour and defence.</p>
            <p>So that we in this land, with Iſrael of old, have a divine warrant to ſay,—"Rejoice O ye nations with his people, for the Lord will avenge the blood of his people, and will render recompence to his adverſaries, and will be merciful to his land; and to his people." Dent. xxxii, 43.</p>
            <p>Here let us make a ſhort pauſe:—And may all the people ſay AMEN!</p>
            <p>And now brethren of the ſtock of New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; what has been ſuggeſted from the divine oracles, directs our attention to the occaſion of this anniverſary: which is for a memorial of the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical commencement of the preſent unjuſt and unnatural war: and particularly the innocent blood cruelly ſhed at the doors of this houſe—And the conſequent murders, and ravages perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015279_0018_0F9882D2BAA7EE20"/>
by Britiſh troops, on that black and ever memorable day April nineteenth, one thouſand ſeven hundred, ſeventy-five!</p>
            <p>With reluctance, we renew the grief of bereav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed friends, ſtill in tears, for their deceaſed, whoſe garments, were here rolled in blood!—and which from this ſource, has awfully, ſtreamed through the land.—The guilt of which we truſt, the earth will not long cover.</p>
            <p>The preſent generation, in this town and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, need no information, of what their weeping eyes then ſaw—their cars heard—and their pierced heart endured, on that never to be forgotten day—The horrid ſcene, is inſtamped upon all our breaſts, in <hi>characters of blood!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ſummary of thoſe firſt effects of Britiſh wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and unbridled rage, you have faithfully pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Rev. Mr. Clark's printed ſermon, and narrative.—Alſo, the Rev. Mr. Gordon's letter to a gentleman in England, publiſhed in this ſtate.</note> for a memorial to the generations, yet to be born; and we may be ſure, a juſt and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate God remembers, what unfeeling Britons then did.</p>
            <p>Happy for this land! and may we not ſay, happy, for abandoned, and now <hi>deteſted</hi> Britain, if their deſtructions had been limited to that awful day—That we had ſeen no more of our dwellings and flouriſhing towns in flames; and the ſlain of the Lord greatly multiplied.</p>
            <p>But though God in his holy providence, has not, to this time, ſeen fit to ſtill the enemy and the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015279_0019_0F9882D37AA3CB88"/>
avenger; yet bleſſed be his name, he hath not delivered us up to the will of thoſe, whoſe tender mercies are cruelty.</p>
            <p>We gratefully on this day of remembrance, with Moſes of old, bow before the altar of our God, and offer the ſacrifice of praiſe to <hi>Jehovah-Niſſi,</hi> the Lord our banner, who was a preſent help in that day of trouble.</p>
            <p>To accompliſh their unjuſt and cruel purpoſes, the treacherous foe, like evening wolves greedy of prey, and hungry ions from their dens, crept out of Boſton<note n="*" place="bottom">While the town, on the land ſide, was open, and the troops ſupplied with freſh proviſions from the country.</note> through a by-way, in the dark and ſilent night, that unſeen and unawares, they might lay waſte and deſtroy.</p>
            <p>But the Almighty Keeper of Iſrael, who never ſlumbereth, to their ſurprize, brought their hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den counſels ſo far to light, that a few of our brave militia, from adjoining towns, had time to collect, and by God's aſſiſtance, turned the enemy's boaſted victory, into a ſhameful flight.</p>
            <p>Not unto us O Lord—not unto us, but to thy glorious name be all the praiſe.</p>
            <p>And a review of this calamitous war, from that woful day to the preſent, through two ſucceſſive revolving years, affords us much occaſion to ſing of mercy, as well as judgment before the Lord.</p>
            <p>And ſhall any of us now, from the continued and vaunting threats of a determined enemy, deſpond? and ſay God hath caſt away this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.—<hi>God forbid!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:015279_0020_0F9882D43B868298"/>
The Lord hath been our dwelling place, in all paſt generations: and his hand is not ſhortned that it cannot ſave.</p>
            <p>We cannot, on this occaſion, in ſilence paſs over the wonders God has wrought for this people of old, which we have heard with our ears, and our fathers have told us.</p>
            <p>Driven from their native, and otherwiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful abode, by the iron rod of oppreſſion, thoſe worthies eſcaped into this land, the face of which was then, overſpread with thick darkneſs: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting to find here, in a pilgrimage ſtate, a ſecure retreat from perſecution, priſon, and death.</p>
            <p>But while, beginning a new ſettlement, they were neceſſarily involved in peculiar diſtreſs, from fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, nakedneſs, and ſavage alarms: TYRANNY, the great red dragon, ſo called, Rev. xii. 3. caſt out of his mouth water, as a flood to deſtroy them, by endeavouring to ſubvert their<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The kings patent to the emigrants, in ſtrictneſs, was no more then a general quit-claim of his pretended right to theſe lands, from a partial diſcovery of the coaſts; and an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they would receive no moleſtation from him, his ſucceſſors, &amp;c. in the free poſſeſſion of them.</p>
                  <p>Our fathers fairly purchaſed the lands of the aboriginal natives, the only rightful owners, and under them, we now hold, and not the Pope's grant to chriſtian princes.</p>
               </note> ſtipulated claim to their then unſettled inheritance. But in the ſame figurative ſtyle, "the earth helped the woman.</p>
            <p>The civil wars in England, though diſtreſſing to the nation, and the deſerved fate of the king, gave our fathers a temporary relief, till they had taken root in the land.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:015279_0021_0F9882D4FB5A2EF0"/>
But the reſtoration of monarchy, 1660, opened the flood gates to every vice ſupported by royal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample and arbitrary power: our charter ſoon fell a ſacrifice to deſpotic will; and our fathers, then ſaw their rights trampled upon by an <hi>Andros,</hi> as we have ſeen ours of late by a <hi>Gage</hi> and an <hi>Howe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There was indeed, at that day, in the Britiſh nation, virtue ſufficient, to dethrone the tyrant: glorious indeed, might the revolution have been, if the root of tyranny had periſhed with that corrupt branch.</p>
            <p>Monarchy, though under ſtipulated limitations, is pregnant with wo.—A crown with its preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives and pomp, will ſoon darken the wiſeſt head, and corrupt the ſoundeſt heart, and by it's influence, riſe ſuperior to controul.</p>
            <p>The revolution gave preſent redreſs, but the principles of it were never carried into full effect, in Britain; and our liberties, from that period, by patents, greatly abridged.</p>
            <p>The charter, we received from King William, brought, in the face of it, ſome appearance of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ſafety—But in its conſtitution, were the ſeeds of deſtruction.</p>
            <p>The chief magiſtrate, was not of our own choice, but his appointment and continuance in office depended upon the royal pleaſure, and his adminiſtrations, in effect, upon ſecret and arbitrary Inſtructions.</p>
            <p>His negative upon our choice of counſellors; and all acts of aſſembly: his power aſſumed, to

remove, adjourn, prorogue and diſſolve the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Court at his will—his undue influence, in all civil appointments—and his ſole direction and command of the military; muſt, in effect, leave us only the bare name of liberty.</p>
            <p>A governor, thus detached from the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, over which he is commiſſioned to preſide, and dependent upon the crown, or rather a venal officer of ſtate, for his political exiſtence; inſtead of being a father to the people, is laid under ſtrange temptations, for ſelf-ſecurity, to act the part of a vile informer. And experience of late has wofully taught us, that our own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, in this commiſſion, have been the moſt active by every baſe inſinuation, to effect our deſtruction.</p>
            <p>In addition to this oppreſſive power, given to his ſubſtitute, the Britiſh King challenged a right, within a limited time, at his pleaſure, to vacate all laws paſſed by our Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>And the parliament aſſumed a lawleſs power, <hi>ſolely</hi> to confine and regulate our trade and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures at their will.</p>
            <p>To theſe growing oppreſſions, our fathers and we have, for near a century paſt, ſubmitted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſiſtance, though not without complaints in a great meaſure ineffectual: ſtill hoping, that though equity failed, common intereſt might operate for our relief.</p>
            <p>But alaſs! in the preſent reign, our troubles have rapidly ariſen to a criſis.—A diſtreſſing mode<note n="*" place="bottom">The cruel Port-Bill appears to have been plan'd upon Nero's wiſh—That Rome had but one <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>This is a right, which no created being can juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly challenge, it belongs only to God omnipotent: and it would be the higheſt treaſon, and rebellion againſt him who is King of kings, for us tamely to ſubmit to this unjuſt and impious claim of Britons, worms of the duſt, like ourſelves.</p>
            <p>Surely our voluntary conceſſion, to this unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable demand, would be a practical declaration of our readineſs, to go and ſerve other gods. Falſe deities, which our fathers groaned under; but refuſed to ſerve, on the other ſide of the flood.</p>
            <p>To avert the impending ſtorm, we reaſoned—remonſtrated—and entreated: but were rejected, with ſupercilious diſdain. Conqueſt evidently appeared to be their bloody deſign, and full expectation.</p>
            <p>To accompliſh this, an armed force was ſent here, to trample us, our rights, laws, and religion, under their feet. But that the promoters of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable war, (a war, which might excite the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a ſavage) might have a colourable pretence
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015279_0024_0F9882D73AA4DCF8"/>
for engaging in it: their licentious troops were quartered in our capital: that by continual inſults they might provoke the multitude to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
            <p>But our vain hopes of an accommodation, upon equitable terms, and abhorrence of human ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, reſtrained us, under manifold provocations, from taking up arms, until the innocent blood of our friends ſhed in this place—their dying ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies—the groans of the wounded—the heart pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſtreſ of the bereaved—and a full ſenſe of our common danger, awakened theſe ſtates unitedly to ſtand up for their lives, againſt a declared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate enemy.</p>
            <p>And now, I think, it muſt evidently appear, to every perſon, who is not blinded by ſordid inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, or under ſome fatal prejudice, that the war, on our part, is juſt; and that we have been called of God, to take up arms, in our neceſſary defence, and to ſeperate from Britain FOREVER.</p>
            <p>And here, brethren, we may ſafely reſt our cauſe—the cauſe of our much injured and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed country: for the righteous Lord loveth righteouſneſs, and will, in his time, bring forth judgment unto victory.</p>
            <p>Theſe conſiderations, will be our ample ſupport under the heavy burdens of this diſtreſſing war—relieve us under private loſſes—and be an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant conſolation to parents and friends, mourning for their children and relatives, who have fallen in battle—or periſhed in<note n="*" place="bottom">Cruelty, never practiced by the Savages of America!</note> cruel captivity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:015279_0025_0F9882D7FA8E0938"/>
And as God will guard where he ſhall lead—This conſideration muſt animate our vigorous youth, cheerfully to engage in this juſt and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary cauſe—the cauſe of God and their country, and to march intrepid againſt the oppreſſing foe: and undaunted face death, armed with all its terrors, where duty calls. Truſting in the great Captain of our ſalvation, who once died, to deſtroy the laſt enemy which is death, and to procure peace on earth, and good will towards men.</p>
            <p>We bleſs them in the name of God, who thus willingly offer themſelves, to the help of the Lord and his people againſt the mighty: and will not ceaſe to follow them, wherever they are called, with our prayers for the divine preſence and bleſſing.</p>
            <p>The Lord preſerve them all, in their going forth and coming in, from this time forth, forevermore!</p>
            <p>And now as a cloſe—While we trace the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous effects of this unjuſt and deſtructive war; let us reflect, that our real danger doth not origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate from the unceaſing rage of Britain, or their rapacious mercenary allies; nor from the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued traiterous deſigns of falſe brethren among ourſelves: but from the juſt diſpleaſure of our God and Father againſt us, for our manifold of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, againſt his law and goſpel.</p>
            <p>For though we dare not conſider an infinitely juſt and holy God, as agent, in this unjuſt war; yet he ſuffers it as the rod of his correction. for our ſins. But is waiting that he may be gracious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:015279_0026_0F9882D8BA9E2E08"/>
Let us all be humbled under his mighty hand, that he may exalt us in due time.</p>
            <p>We are all forward to complain of need of a general reformation; but this will have no good effect; till from ſelf conviction, we are brought, each one, to ſmite upon his breaſt, and ſay, what have I done? and put away the violence, which is in our own hands.</p>
            <p>God has never caſt off a people utterly, till their apoſtacy hath been nearly univerſal, and they; unreclaimable, by the ordinary methods of divine providence and grace.—God for the ſake of ten righteous perſons, would have ſpared the conſederate cities of Sodom.</p>
            <p>We truſt there are ten thouſands of this God-like character, in theſe united ſtates. But the wiſe virgins ſlumbered and ſlept. Let us awake to righteouſneſs, and ſin not; and reſolve, for ourſelves, and houſes, that we will ſerve the Lord. In their families, eſpecially, the influence of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons, may be very great.</p>
            <p>War, naturally tends to corrupt unguarded youth, both at home, and in the camp. Let us all with the pious patriarch of old, command our children and houſhold to keep the ways of the Lord, that he may bring upon us the promiſed bleſſing.</p>
            <p>Our civil rulers, now dependent only on God and the people; we truſt, will improve their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive authority and example, as a terror to evil doers, and a praiſe to them that do well.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:015279_0027_0F9882D980B3A448"/>
And it is required of the Lord's miniſters, who publiſh glad tidings of peace, to teach tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors their ways; that ſinners may be converted to God; then will glory dwell in our land, and upon all the glory, God will create a defence.</p>
            <p>The call of Providence, brethren, is particular to us of this town and neighbourhood, where the furious flames of war firſt brake forth, and raged with unrelenting deſtruction.</p>
            <p>We have the wormwood and gall deep in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance: let our ſoul be humbled within us. And while the deſolations of that day of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance are preſent to our view; let none of us think, that our houſes ſhall continue for ever, and our dwelling places to all generations; nor vainly boaſt ourſelves of tomorrow, for we know not what a day may bring forth.</p>
            <p>And may the loſſes we have ſuſtained, excite our compaſſion and continual prayers for diſtant towns and ſtates, who have ſince largely drank of this bitter cup of trembling.</p>
            <p>We have this conſolation, while we recall to mind our griefs: that our friends, murdered by the enemy, here ſleep quietly in the duſt with their fathers, while many others lament the loſs of thoſe, equally dear to them—whoſe bones are ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, at the graves mouth, or have been inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly buried, with the burial of an aſs, drawn and caſt forth.</p>
            <p>Our open enemies are now at ſome diſtance from us, and though not free from the alarms of war—we hear not, as for years paſt, the dread
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:015279_0028_0F9882DA3A818A00"/>
thunder from the mouth of their cannon. Let us all wiſely hearken to the ſtill ſmall voice of God, in his word: then ſhall all thoſe who have conſpired for the deſtruction of this land, ſoon, with ſhame, as chaff before the wind, be driven far away, no more to return. But let us not return to ſin, and fooliſhneſs.</p>
            <p>Finally, brethren, whatever may be the event of this our glorious ſtruggle for liberty and life—Death, the king of terrors, is invincibly armed, and with a quick ſtep, advancing towards all of us.—In this war there is no diſcharge—The grave is our houſe—here high and low—rich and poor—bond and free, muſt ſhortly, for a ſeaſon, lie down alike in the duſt.</p>
            <p>Many of our dear friends and acquaintance, who eſcaped the edge of the ſword, are ſince that fatal day, by a natural death, removed into dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.—We ſhall go to them.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed be God, there is a life immortal, beyond the grave—Let us all, without any further delay, make our peace with God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo ſecure a title to the heavenly inheritance, which cannot be taken away.</p>
            <p>The Son of God, the everlaſting King, is now ſending commiſſioners to us, with no <hi>deluſive</hi> terms of peace. Let us all by faith repair to his banner, and put ourſelves under the ſhadow of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty wings then ſhall we be free indeed. Then will he who is mighty to ſave be our ſhield, while in this our militant ſtate:—ſupport us in our conflict with death, the laſt enemy;—and at the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:015279_0029_0F9882DAFA978300"/>
laſt day, when all that ſleep in the duſt, at his powerfull call, ſhall come forth—while tyrant kings, great captains, and mighty oppreſſors, ſhall in vain ſtrive to hide their guilty heads, under rocks and mountains—He will raiſe us to his throne—To everlaſting peace and glory, in his Heavenly Kingdom.</p>
