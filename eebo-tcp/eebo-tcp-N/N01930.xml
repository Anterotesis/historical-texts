            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Some Remedies propoſed for the Reſtoring the ſunk Credit of this Province of <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvannia;</hi> with ſome needful Remarks on its Trade.</head>
            <p>IT is a neceſſary and primary Maxim in every Trading Country, <hi>That the Credit of the Country muſt be preſerved:</hi> In do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which two Things are needful;</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>The Produce and Manufactory muſt be good in their Kinds, and not wanting is Weight or Meaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>The Pay of the Country ought to be ready and punctual.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So neceſſary are theſe Maxims to be obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all Trading Countries, that no Country can be found either rich or happy ſo long as they are neglected. We need go no farther for an Example, than by comparing the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> with the <hi>preſent</hi> State of this Province. When formerly, the Produce of this Province was preferred before that of <hi>New-York</hi> for its Goodneſs, and our Payments at Home ready and punctual, Did any People on this Continent encreaſe more in Riches? And who was there then in Trade that did not get Eſtates? And, where a Country of better Credit? But ſince our Produce has deſervedly
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002287_0003_0FDB1A7329AE6900"/>
got an ill Character in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> by our unreſtricted Manner of Bolting; and our run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Stock of Money being ſunk has intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the moſt ſcandalous Cuſtom at Home, of endleſs Truſt and a beggarly Diſcount; Where is there a Country more ſcandalous A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and more beggarly at Home?</p>
            <p>Almoſt every one knows, how ſhort we fall in ballancing our Trade with <hi>England,</hi> and that if ſome Produce or Manufactory could be found to ballance that Trade, the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage we have in the <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Trade would in ſome time procure us a Stock of Running Caſh; but when good Fortune will be pleaſed to favour us in this laſt Particular, is not poſſible for any one at this time to tell, tho' ſeveral Things may be very reaſonably of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to our Tryal, which we need not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect: But in the mean time the D<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing Credit of a Country muſt not lie unregarded. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, whoſe Remedies are unknown, are cured rather by Chance than Skill; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may prudently be left to the Reſult of Time: But Diſeaſes, whoſe Cures are known, are not to be neglected. <hi>For,</hi> as one of the Faculty wiſely ſaith, <hi>every Diſeaſe is not mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, yet every Diſeaſe is hurtful; therefore it is highly imprudent not to cure a Diſeaſe as ſoon as poſſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The only Remedies that at preſent can be propoſed, to reſtore the ſunk Credit of this Province are, what the recited Maxims of all Trading Countries directs us to; which are evidently two, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>We are informed by late Advices from <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica,</hi> That <hi>New-York</hi> Flour is ſold for 40 <hi>s. per Barrel, Philadelphia</hi> Flour at 30 <hi>s.</hi> The Reaſon for this Difference in the Sales is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly the Badneſs of our Flour. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>The ill Character our Flour juſtly meets with in the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> occaſions Loſſes to this Country of many Kinds: As, 1<hi>ſt,</hi> The <hi>New-York</hi> Flour being juſtly preferred before ours, is certain to be ſold firſt; our Veſſels do frequently wait till <hi>New-York</hi> Flour is ſold, or go to another Port. Our Voyages by this Means are rendered long, and conſequently more expenſive by ſeveral Pounds <hi>per Cent.</hi> than they need to be. We alſo export leſs Flour probably by <hi>One Third</hi> than we ſhould do, were our Flower eſteemed equal with theirs of <hi>New-York.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Innumerable are the Loſſes that flow from hence: Could we ſell but a <hi>Fifth</hi> more Flour

Therefore never ſo ſmall an Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this Trade, would be ſo much Help towards ballancing our Trade with <hi>England.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It is melancholly to tell the miſerable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this Province, occaſioned by a Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in this laſt Particular. How deplorable
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002287_0006_0FDB1A78EEAA4DE8"/>
are the Lives of the common People! Their Trades and Callings diſcouraged and valued at nought: What real Eſtates they have had are mortgaged, eat out and conſumed; and the whole Province look'd upon by all Foreigners, as a Country beggarly and ſcandalous, not worth Trading with. But the melancholly Decay of Credit in this Province requires not much Time to demonſtrate, for every <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

            <p>Now to recover a running Stock of Money ſunk in any Country, theſe three Things are propoſed to us.</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt, To recover the Ballance of a Trade, which may be ſaid to be loſt; or, by forcing ſome New Trade, where the Ballance may be hoped will fall in Favour of the Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>To raiſe the Price of Silver or Gold; for theſe, like other Commodities, will be carried to the beſt Markets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To make Money by Publick Authority, which ſhall paſs by Virtue of a Stamp impreſs'd on ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing there to be had, whether it be Pewter, Silver, Spelter, Braſs or Paper, it matters not
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002287_0007_0FDB1A79EE305740"/>
which, the ready Currency of the Thing is all that is to be look'd to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe three are the only Ways made Uſe of, to procure a running Stock ſunk in any Country.</p>
            <p>The firſt Thing propoſed cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured in this Province by any Means yet tried. The Second will undoubtedly do ſomething, though probably too ſlow: But the Third promiſes, not only a ſpeedy Recovery of our ſunk Stock, but likewiſe Matters profitable, and highly needful for the Country in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; which, we hope, will appear by what follows.</p>
            <p>But, before we propoſe any thing in this Matter, it will be neceſſary to anſwer ſome Objections, that are ſequently offered againſt raiſing a Running Stock after this third Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner propoſed; wherein alſo, by the by, we ſhall obſerve the Method and Succeſs of other Countries in this Particular.</p>
            <p>It is a common Notion of Men unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Trade, That <hi>Nothing can be made the Running Stock of any Country, but Silver or Gold, without ſome Loſs to that Country.</hi> And this is a Miſtake ſenſibly ariſing from a defective Knowledge of what Silver and Gold really is on the one Hand, and the Nature of a Running Stock on the other.</p>
            <p>For Silver and Gold has no more Title to be a Running Stock of any Country, than. <hi>John of Nokes</hi> has to be Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi>; they are allowed to be ſo by the general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and Choice of a Country, and becauſe of

the comparative Value they have above moſt other Commodities: Beſides, their convenient Carriage and eaſy Conveyance make moſt Countries chooſe them as running Purchaſers of all other Commodities; yet any other Commodity may be made a running Stock as well as theſe.</p>
            <p>And again: The narrow Notions Men generally have of the Nature of a running Stock, make them ſuppoſe, That nothing can be made the running Stock of any Country without ſome Loſs.</p>
            <p>Was the running Stock of any Country deſigned for no other Uſe than to be exported? Then nothing could be preferred before Silver or Gold, becauſe they are in Demand in moſt Countries; and skilful Merchants could ſca<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> ever loſe by them, as they too frequently do by other Commodities.</p>
            <p>But as it is moſt evident, That the run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Stock is a thing which every Country wiſely covets to preſerve; therefore whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is the Running Stock of any Country, muſt be by <hi>ſo much</hi> the more valuable, by <hi>how much</hi> it is capable of being confined to the Buſineſs it was deſigned for: And herein <hi>Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> or <hi>Gold</hi> cannot be ſo certainly confined, as ſome other Things in Uſe may.</p>
            <p>But what is the moſt proper thing to raiſe a Running Stock of Money in this Province, the Legiſlators ought to be the beſt Judges: However, we hope to be pardoned, if we take a View of other Countries, what Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods they have taken, and what Succeſs they
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002287_0009_0FDB1A80A887A410"/>
have met with in their farther Proceedings in this Affair.</p>
            <p>We find it was ever the Opinion and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Cuſtom of moſt Countries, where Gold and Silver was not ſufficient to carry on the Domeſtick Trade, nothing was equal to <hi>STAMP'D PAPER,</hi> whoſe indebted Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue was ſecured to the Receiver by ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Fund.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Dutch</hi> indeed, by Virtue of a Stamp, impreſs'd on a <hi>baſe Metal,</hi> have raiſed a Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Stock of Money, which is frequently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into other Countries; but the intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick Value of this Money is near <hi>One Fifth</hi> ſhort of the Value it commonly paſſeth for. Such a Kind of Money, and ſometimes much worſe, have we frequently met with, which, by the Authority of ſome Prince or State, has been made current, to ſupply ſome preſſing Occaſions. But this Kind of Money being ſupported only by an abſolute Power, and not by any viſible Fund, cannot be made but where ſuch a Power doth preſide and giveth Aſſent to the Currency of ſuch Money: But in little Colonies, at a great Diſtance from their Prince, ſuch Money cannot be expected will be allowed by him to be made.</p>
            <p>In this Caſe, a Piece of <hi>Paper,</hi> ſtamp'd and figured, not eaſily to be counterfeited, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the <hi>Value</hi> it ſhall paſs for, (in the Manner and Form hereafter mentioned) and this <hi>Value</hi> ſecured to the Poſſeſſor by ſome viſible Fund, is really a Money not inferior to the beſt <hi>Silver</hi> and <hi>Gold</hi> for a Domeſtick
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002287_0010_0FDB1A826CC95CD0"/>
Trade, and is evidently ſuperior to the Money made of <hi>baſe Metals,</hi> ſupported only by the Authority of one or more Perſons Will and Pleaſure, and not by any intrinſick Value or viſible Fund. But it is as poſſible to beat the plaineſt Truths into ſome Mens Heads as it is to make a Dromedary ſpeak: They readily tell us, That <hi>Paper-Money is nought; It is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive</hi> (ſay they); <hi>To all Places, where it comes, it carries away all the Silver</hi>: And thereupon call to evidence (as they weakly ſuppoſe) the ill Fate of <hi>South-Carolina</hi> and <hi>Boſton</hi>:</p>
            <p>But ſhould we ſuppoſe <hi>Paper-Money</hi> in any Caſe injurious to <hi>South-Carolina</hi> or <hi>Boſton,</hi> it would be a groſs Miſtake; though it is to be confeſſed, that in <hi>South-Carolina</hi> they were <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

And in <hi>Boſton,</hi> this is the Fault of their <hi>Paper-Money</hi> (if any) they have <hi>too much</hi>; yet can neither the Trade, nor the Silver or Gold of <hi>South-Carolina</hi> or <hi>Boſton</hi> be ſaid to be leſſened one Jot by this.</p>
            <p>It is only the Want of a Produce or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactury in a Port, to ballance the Trade of ſome other Port it deals with, or the low Value is ſet on Silver or Gold, do carry it out of any Port. As to Trade, a due proportion'd Quantity of <hi>Paper-Money</hi>; whoſe Value is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, is as far from hurting it, as a Piece of Bread an empty Traveller.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:002287_0011_0FDB1A83A9B03208"/>Since they made <hi>Paper-Money</hi> in <hi>Boſton</hi> are leſs Fiſh exported? Or, fewer Veſſels built? Do any one refuſe to receive their Bills? By what Trade can they poſſibly get a ſufficient Stock of Silver or Gold, to ſupply the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try with Running Caſh? And if they can no where command it, as moſt certainly their Trade at preſent cannot do it What <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

Inſtead of a Bag, or Pocket, they muſt hire a Cart to carry Home <hi>Fifty Shillings</hi>; and after all, the intrinſick Value of their Running Stock would be daily in Danger of rotting or waſting ſome way or other.</p>
            <p>The very ſame may be ſaid of <hi>South Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina</hi>; Doth Paper-Money frighten Silver or Gold from coming among them? Or, are they not uncapable of ballancing the Trade of moſt Money'd Parts? Do fewer Veſſels go from thence to <hi>England</hi>? Do not Foreigners receive their <hi>Paper-Money</hi>? O, do any refuſe to take it again at the ſame Rates it was received? Do any Traders loſe a Farthing by it? And, to conclude, If there was not <hi>Paper-Money</hi> in <hi>South-Carolina,</hi> how could the Trade of that Country be ſo readily diſpatched as it is?</p>
            <p>It is to be confeſſed, That one of our Neighbouring Provinces hath met with ill Succeſs in their making <hi>Paper-Money</hi>; it ſunk in its Value: And the Publick Authority ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther encouraging this Misfortune, than put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002287_0012_0FDB1A88584DD128"/>
any Stop to it, its <hi>Value</hi> entirely vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the whole Country was greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by this Misfortune, particularly <hi>Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does.</hi> But this proceeded not from any Evil entailed on <hi>Paper-Money,</hi> but the bad Managing of it: For, in the firſt Place, they allowed it not to be (as it ought) a lawful Tender in all Payments; which thing will ever render Paper, or any other Money, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to that which is unlimited in its Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Beſides, Governor <hi>Granvill</hi> imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after being called Home, and having a large Quantity of Paper-Money by him, offered it at ſome Diſcount for Silver-Money. Had none been over-look'd in this wrong Proceeding, none but His Excellency would have been a Loſer, thoſe that bought of him would have got by it: But, like Men as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of their own Intereſt, as of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Money they had made, every one ſtrove who could moſt undervalue it, till at laſt, almoſt every one had a worthleſs Paper left in his Pocket, with the Title of Pounds, though not worth one Farthing.</p>
            <p>And this is no other than will happen in Matters of higher Nature, if Laws are made not to be obeyed. Had the Magiſtracy timely puniſhed ſuch Perſons as offered to buy or ſell at a <hi>lower Value</hi> than what the Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators had authorized the Bills to paſs for, all the ill Conſequences would have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and they might have done as much Good to the Country in general, as any Money
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002287_0013_0FDB1A89A55816D0"/>
not a ſufficient Tender in all Payments could have done.</p>
            <p>But to propoſe the beſt and moſt certain Manner of making <hi>Paper</hi>-Money, not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to Silver or Gold, for the Running Stock of any Country, three Things are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be regarded, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>The Funds from whence it riſeth; or, more properly, the lands that give it Credit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>The Manner of preſerving its Value.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>The Manner of Sinking it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. One Kind of Fund made Uſe of to give Credit to a certain Quantity of Paper Money, is, A real Security given for a certain Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Bills, at an Office appointed by Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Authority for that Purpoſe; which is no other than like the Manner of mortgaging the Eſtate of one Neighbour to another; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that here the Money belonging to the Government, the Intereſt becomes the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick's Advantage. And this publick Way of lending Money has been looked upon of ſuch Advantage to the Borrower, as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly it is to the Lender, that private Offices of this Kind have been encouraged; particularly, one at <hi>Weſtminster,</hi> authorized by Patent, to lend upon Security of Houſe, Lands, Goods, Wares, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A Thing of Advantage to the poorer Sort, as well Houſekeepers as Tradeſmen, who, by ſome Misfortune, had
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002287_0014_0FDB1A8B49189D00"/>
fallen behind-hand in their Stocks, by which Means they were happily furniſhed with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to carry forward their ſinking Trades, or buy Food to feed their ſtarving Families, till ſuch time as by Induſtry they could mend their ſunk Fortunes; which bad Fate often happens, both to the Good and Wiſe, by Ways unforeſeen by any Mortal, as Fire, Sickneſs, becoming Surely, Perſecution, Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Fund in Uſe to give Credit to a certain Quantity of Paper-Money, is a Tax hid by Publick Authority; which, after a limited Quantity of Paper Money has been diſperſed through a Country, for paying ſome publick Debts, whether Arrears, or Yearly-Salaries of publick Officers, or Buildings for the publick Uſe of the Country. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſaid Tax laid upon ſuch unperiſhable Produce or Manufacture of the Country, as will ſink yearly a certain Quantity of the ſaid Bills, ſometimes <hi>One Twealfth, One Eighth,</hi> or <hi>One Fourth,</hi> as the Legiſlators think moſt eaſy and advantageous to the Publick.</p>
            <p>But to make this more plain, we ſhall ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, That in this Province there is a very great Neceſſity for ſome publick Buildings, and to pay publick Debts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed beyond Suppoſition; and what is alſo as true, That we have not Money to go to the Market with, much leſs to pay large Taxes; and that <hi>Three</hi> or <hi>Four Thouſand Pounds</hi> muſt be raiſed very quickly, to pay theſe our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Demands: And ſhould we ſuppoſe our
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002287_0015_0FDB1A90166B8080"/>
Legiſlators world appoint Bills to be made to the Value of the above Sum, and the ſaid Bills to be paid to anſwer the ſaid Demands, then ſuch a Tax muſt be laid upon ſome of our Produce, or Manufactury, as will raiſe <hi>per Annum</hi> the <hi>One Eighth,</hi> &amp;c. of the ſaid 4000 <hi>l.</hi> which Tax being yearly paid in Bills into the Treaſury of this Province, and thoſe Bills deſtroyed as ſoon as they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, will evidently in <hi>Eight</hi> Years ſink the whole Sum of <hi>Four Thouſand Pounds.</hi> Which Way of raiſing of large Sums at once, and paying by Degrees, is certainly the eaſieſt and beſt Way for the Raiſing of publick Buildings, or paying publick Debts, that ever was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook by any Country: Beſides that, to omit the great Advantage a Country drained of its Caſh muſt enjoy, by the Running Stock of Money that muſt naturally circulate from ſuch an Undertaking.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Thing neceſſary, in order to preſerve the Value of Paper-Money (after once it is diſtributed through a Country, That it fall not lower than the ſtated Value of Silver, brings to our Conſideration the moſt material Art of Managing of Paper-Money: From the ill managing of this Part have all the Misfortunes happened that ever befel Paper-Money: To avoid which three Things are neceſſary to be regarded.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That it exceed not in Quantity the Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Stock of Money a Country demands in its Trade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:002287_0016_0FDB1A912D46BA90"/>For Paper Money being no exportable Commodity, whatſoever Quantity there is above what the Trade demands, will lie dead, and conſequently ſink the Value of the whole Sum of Bills in Proportion to the dead Quantity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Paper-Money muſt be made a lawful Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in all Payments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For what Money ſoever is not ſuch, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be called the Current Money of any Country but a lame Stock; like a founder'd Horſe, will diſappoint the Owner at ſome time or other, and teach him, that to run well, it is neceſſary he ſhould be ſound in every Part. If any Kind of Money will not buy me Bread as well as Drink, my Wants are ſcarce Half ſupplied, and I may ſtarve for want of this one Thing neceſſary, as well as if I had neither.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>That Intereſt of Paper-Money muſt not be inferior to Silver, or any other Currency of a Country.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For what is it makes Money valued in a Country, but the general Uſe of it in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Debts, and procuring us all our bodily Wants; and withal, be every way as valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Poſſeſſor, as the Money of a Country can be made to be?? And how can any Money do otherwiſe than deceive the Poſſeſſor, if he cannot lend it upon the ſame Intereſt, as any other at the ſame Time in Uſe? Which thing, if not regarded, will ſink the Value of Paper-Money, as well as any other thing whatever.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:002287_0017_0FDB1A92A45383C8"/>3<hi>dly,</hi> The laſt Particular, we propoſed to render Paper-Money no way inferior to Silver or Gold; that no Poſſeſſor of the ſaid Money ſhall, upon the Calling in of the ſame, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Loſs or Damage: But this being very eaſy to be collected from what has been ſaid, it would be needleſs to add any thing further in this Peace.</p>
            <p>Whilſt we have been thus expatiating on the low State of this Province, propoſing a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Way for her Recovery, and had brought theſe Remarks to a Concluſion, there are two Things of ill Conſequence, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to us from Abroad, which juſt now oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur to our View, the Remedying of which cannot but be of Advantage.</p>
            <p>The firſt is, <hi>Rum imported from the</hi> Weſt-Indies <hi>in high-bilged Cask</hi>; which doth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently wrong this Country, in its Returns from thence, no ſmall Value yearly; beſides the great Loſs Retailers of Rum (who are generally of the poorer Sort) muſt needs ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Thing, is, <hi>Our Over-looking the Veſſels of a Neighbouring Colony, who very much hinder the Freight of our own; and at the ſame time do leſſen the Ballance of our Trade in the</hi> Weſt-Indies: They bring us nothing of a Produce or Manufacture of their own worth mentioning, and at their Return rob our Veſſels of their Freight to the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi>; and what is worſe frequently import us <hi>Salt:</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:002287_0018_0FDB1A93B3A1A2D8"/>
For if we conſult our own Intereſt, we ought to import it in our own Bottoms only.</p>
            <p>The Nation of <hi>England</hi> eſteems it no ſmall Loſs, to ſuffer <hi>Hollanders, F<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
