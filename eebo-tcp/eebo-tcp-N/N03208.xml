            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ANY excellent <hi>Pens,</hi> in our <hi>Nation,</hi> have of late Years appeared in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of <hi>Divine Revelation;</hi> which has been boldly attack'd, openly inſulted, and ſometimes profanely ridicul'd, by the <hi>Deiſts</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> of the preſent Day; with a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to <hi>ſuperior</hi> Underſtanding and Judgment, and <hi>Freedom</hi> of Thinking; as if all beſide <hi>Themſelves</hi> were hoodwink'd and ſhackled by <hi>Prejudices of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation,</hi> or corrupted and reſtrained by <hi>Worldly

            </p>
            <p>Great has been the <hi>Provocation</hi> to anſwer ſome of the more <hi>licentious</hi> and ſcurrilous <hi>Advocates</hi> for Infidelity according to their <hi>Folly,</hi> leſt they be wiſe in their own Conceit: But great has been the <hi>Guard</hi> and Caution on the part of the noble and ſerious <hi>Defenders</hi> of the Divine Authority of the <hi>Bible,</hi> to write with Decency and Juſtice, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and Gravity, Reaſon and Argument, on a Subject of ſo great Importance to the Honour of God and the Salvation of Souls. They have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs <hi>contended earneſtly for the Faith,</hi> while they have given the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of it <hi>with Meekneſs of Wiſdom;</hi> and Eno' has been ſaid to <hi>convince Gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers,</hi> to <hi>ſtop the Mouths of unruly and vain Talkers,</hi> and to <hi>confirm the Souls of the Diſciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am <hi>my Self</hi> in a particular manner obliged to mention, with great Acknowledgment, the Pleaſure and Benefit I found in reading Dr. <hi>Thomas Burnet</hi>'s Demonſtration of true Religion in a Chain of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Conſequences; and a later <hi>Author</hi> of <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion examin'd with Candour;</hi> to which the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Diſſertation</hi> owes its Riſe. It pretends not to any like <hi>Elaborateneſs,</hi> but is written for People of a lower Rank, who cannot riſe to the <hi>Price</hi> of the fore-named Books. We write for the <hi>Places</hi> where we live, and for the <hi>People</hi> to whom we belong; and at the Requeſt of <hi>Thoſe</hi> to whom the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Pages</hi> were acceptable and profitable from the <hi>Pulpit</hi> under another <hi>Form,</hi> I now publiſh them in <hi>this</hi> of a <hi>Diſſertation</hi> on the <hi>firſt Chapters of the</hi> BIBLE.</p>
            <p>If <hi>theſe firſt Pages in the Book of God</hi> do not appear worthy of his <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> we may even give up the Reſt of the <hi>Bible.</hi> If God has not
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003887_0006_10020C46098C84E0"/>ſpoken to us by <hi>Moſes,</hi> neither has He by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Prophets;</hi> no, nor by JESUS and his <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.</hi> But if it be Evident that <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote by Inſpiration of God, it is a ſure and ſtrong <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> for, and <hi>Argument</hi> of the Credibility of the whole Sacred <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> which we find bearing a ſtrict <hi>Reference</hi> unto, <hi>Agreement</hi> with, and to be the <hi>Fulfilment</hi> of what <hi>Moſes</hi> has written.</p>
            <p>The whole of <hi>Revealed Religion,</hi> the whole Doctrine of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> ſtands on this Foot. The <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles</hi> all bear Witneſs to the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Moſes.</hi> The <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> ends with this, <hi>"Remember the Law of Moſes my Servant!</hi> and the <hi>New</hi> begins and ends with the like Teſtimony to <hi>Him</hi> as Inſpired of God, and ſent by Him. It begins with leading us back to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Joh. v. 39, 45, &amp;c. <hi>Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have Eternal Life, and Theſe are they that teſtify of Me: Do not think that I will accuſe you unto the Father; there is one that accuſeth you, even Moſes, in whom ye truſt: For had ye believed Moſes ye would have believed Me, for he wrote of Me; But if ye believe not his Writings, how ſhall ye believe my Words?</hi> — And if we look to the <hi>Cloſe</hi> of our <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> we find it ending with <hi>"the Song of Moſes and the Lamb.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will not go into the <hi>Honours of Moſes,</hi> as they are deliver'd to us in the Sacred Pages, leſt it ſhould ſeem a <hi>begging the Queſtion</hi> before us; but let us only open our <hi>Bibles</hi> and read the ſhort <hi>Narrative</hi> given of the <hi>Creation</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> and of <hi>Man</hi> upon it, his <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> and ſee whether it be not moſt worthy of the <hi>Majeſty, Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> of the MOST HIGH; the moſt fit and proper <hi>Beginning</hi> of a <hi>Revelation</hi> of God to Man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:003887_0007_10020C9EE9B52B78"/>
The firſt Book of <hi>Moſes</hi> is <hi>Hiſtorical.</hi> And it is the grand Honour of <hi>Hiſtory</hi> that the <hi>Revelations</hi> of God begin thus. And if we weigh the Thing well we muſt needs judge that the Inſpired <hi>Oracles</hi> muſt ſo begin. Lapſed and ignorant <hi>Mankind</hi> by <hi>Moſes</hi> Time needed a <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of their <hi>own</hi> Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, their <hi>firſt</hi> State and the <hi>Origine</hi> of Evil. And this muſt be a <hi>Doctrinal Hiſtory,</hi> concerning GOD and <hi>Themſelves; how</hi> God made <hi>Them</hi> and all Things <hi>very good; what</hi> He made 'em <hi>for,</hi> and what He required of them; <hi>how</hi> they came into their preſent State of Sin and Miſery, and what <hi>Way</hi> there is for their <hi>Recovery</hi> out of it. This is the <hi>Argument</hi> and Subſtance of the Book of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and more eſpecially of the <hi>firſt three Chapters</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>GOD there informs us firſt concerning HIMSELF, his Own ETERNAL BEING AND GODHEAD, and then concerning his <hi>Works,</hi> the Origine of the <hi>World,</hi> and the Manner and End of <hi>our own</hi> Formation. In what other, or better Manner, can we think that a Revelation from God ſhould begin? The <hi>firſt Verſe</hi> of the <hi>Bible</hi> ſhows it to be the <hi>Book of God: "In the Beginning God created the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens and the Earth.</hi> What, but <hi>this,</hi> ſhould be the <hi>firſt Line of Scripture?</hi> The DIVINE MAJESTY here ſpeaks of <hi>Himſelf</hi> as the <hi>Firſt Cauſe</hi> of all Things; That <hi>of Him and to Him are all Things,</hi> and <hi>for His Pleaſure they are and were created.</hi> The <hi>one</hi> only true Foundation of all <hi>Science</hi> and of all <hi>Religion.</hi> It was not poſſible for <hi>Man</hi> to know any thing aright concerning Himſelf, or the Viſible Works of God, till he knew this. <hi>This</hi> is the <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage</hi> and <hi>Superſcription</hi> of God upon the <hi>Bible</hi> in the firſt Line of it. God being to write <hi>His Book,</hi> for the Uſe of the Sons of Men, thro' all Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, put his <hi>Name</hi> before it in theſe Words, <hi>In the Beginning GOD created the Heavens and the Earth.</hi>

GOD is here repreſented as <hi>Self-Exiſient,</hi> and in <hi>his own Times,</hi> as the <hi>bleſſed and only Potentate,</hi> giving unto all Things their Exiſtence and <hi>Being,</hi> viſible and inviſible; by an Act of his <hi>Will,</hi> and a <hi>Word</hi> of his Power. How well does this firſt Line of <hi>Moſes</hi> agree to the <hi>Pſalm</hi> which bears his Name? Pſal. xc. 2, 4. <hi>Before the Mountains were bro't forth, or ever Thou hadſt formed the Earth and the World, from Everlaſting to Everlaſting Thou art God: For a thouſand Years in thy Sight are but as Yeſterday when it is paſt, and as a Watch in the Night.</hi> The <hi>Eternal</hi> God ſpeaks by <hi>Moſes</hi> of His own Eternity, how He was before all Things; and the <hi>Infinite</hi> God ſpeaks of his own Infinity, his infinite Power which <hi>by a Word</hi> bro't the viſible Heavens and Earth into their Being and Order; firſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Matter</hi> into Being, ſufficient for the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Univerſe,</hi> and then ſpake it into that <hi>Beauty</hi> and comely Proportion which our Eyes behold.— What, <hi>but This,</hi> ought the firſt Line of ſacred Scripture to contain? He that does not ſee or read <hi>God</hi> in it is blind; and he that does not hear God ſpeaking in it of Himſelf, has no Underſtanding of what he hears. The God of infinite Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs ſpeaks of theſe his immenſe Perfections, in theſe <hi>few</hi> Words, as plainly and copiouſly as if <hi>Volumes</hi> were writ of them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the Beginning,</hi> ſoil, of the <hi>Univerſe;</hi> when the <hi>Worlds</hi> came into Being, the upper and the lower; it was meerly by the Sovereign <hi>Will</hi> and <hi>Word</hi> of the LORD GOD; at what <hi>Time</hi> and in what <hi>Order. Theſe Worlds</hi> had their Beginning, but GOD had none. God gave Them their Exiſtence, <hi>when, where</hi> and <hi>how</hi> it pleaſed Him; and made all moſt <hi>good</hi> and <hi>perfect,</hi> for His <hi>Own</hi> Praiſe and Glory. There was <hi>no other</hi> Will, Wiſdom, Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Power to do this, but His who is THE ETER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAL;

The <hi>Fulneſs</hi> of the Eternal GODHEAD is in it, and <hi>all Things</hi> that God has made are in it too.—One might dwell and expatiate on this <hi>firſt Word of Moſes</hi> for Ever, and never be able to think or ſay any thing on it adequate to the Fulneſs of Senſe and Spirit in it.— In what <hi>other</hi> Words could the <hi>Book of God</hi> begin? O the Height and Depth, the Length and Breadth of this <hi>one</hi> Line! <hi>It is Light, without any Darkneſs at all!</hi> GOD dwells and ſhines in it! It is <hi>Light unapprochable and full of Glory!</hi> Here is the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and Finiſhing of the <hi>Creation</hi> of God in a Single Line! And then the DIVINE SPIRIT deſcends to that Part and <hi>Point</hi> of the Creation that belongs to <hi>Man,</hi> our <hi>Earth,</hi> and proceeds to ſpeak of it.</p>
            <p>Ver. 2. <hi>And the Earth was without Form and void, and Darkneſs was upon the Face of the Deep.</hi> This we muſt ſuppoſe, unleſs we ſhould rather think it becoming the Glory of God to give every <hi>Globe</hi> in the Univerſe its <hi>perfect</hi> Form at once. He could indeed as eaſily have done this, but I think the Glory of Divine Wiſdom and Goodneſs more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in the <hi>gradual Proceſs</hi> related by <hi>Moſes.</hi> God had firſt created the <hi>Heavens</hi> and Hoſts of glorious <hi>Angels,</hi> a World of bright <hi>Intelligences</hi> to behold the lower Worlds, take their Place, Form and Motion. And as theſe were finiſhing from Day to Day, one Part after another, and every Part more and more perfective of the Whole, thoſe <hi>bleſſed Spectators ſang together</hi> and ſhouted forth the Praiſes of that infinite Perfection, which they ſaw with Wonder in every ſtep: As we read <hi>Job</hi> xxxviii. 7.</p>
            <p>The moſt perfect <hi>Idea</hi> that the Mind of Man can now frame concerning the Formation of our <hi>Earth,</hi> and ſo of the other <hi>Planets</hi> within our
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:003887_0010_10020CA2468E63F8"/>
               <hi>Circle,</hi> is <hi>this,</hi> "That they were firſt <hi>a Chaos,</hi> or confus'd Particles of watry, oily, earthly, aery, and fiery Matter, blended together, without any diſtinct Order, Form or Beauty, a darkſome <hi>Maſs</hi> and Deep, which we ſhould have been ready to think could never be bro't into any Order, Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Uſe. We read that THE SPIRIT OF GOD <hi>moved</hi> on this Face of Diſorder and vaſt Confuſion: And who elſe ſhould reveal to us what a <hi>void</hi> and formleſs thing the firſt <hi>Materials,</hi> or Collection of Matter, for ſuch a World as this, muſt needs be?</p>
            <p>And now, what would a conſidering <hi>Angel</hi> think ſhould be the <hi>firſt Thing produced,</hi> or call'd forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome Appearance, out of this Darkneſs and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order? What ſhould it be but LIGHT? And <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us <hi>this</hi> was it, Ver. 3. <hi>And GOD ſaid, Let there be Light, and there was Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Did <hi>Moſes</hi> conceive this? wiſe as he was and penetrating, even as an <hi>Angel</hi> of God, and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all the Phyloſophy of <hi>Egypt?</hi> No, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Ken of any humane Mind or Wiſdom. How is it ſpoken <hi>like a GOD!</hi> and how <hi>God-like</hi> is the Account of the Production of one Thing and another? <hi>"GOD ſaid, Let</hi> there be this and that! and <hi>let</hi> it be thus and thus! The Perfection of <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> ſaw at once <hi>how</hi> it ſhould be, and the Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Will</hi> ſaid, <hi>Let it be ſo.</hi> He <hi>ſpake</hi> and it was done, He <hi>commanded</hi> and it immediately exiſted, and was eſtabliſhed. Here is perfect <hi>Eaſe</hi> in the Production of every Thing; and in the <hi>Projection</hi> of it, if that Word be lawful. <hi>Moſes</hi> could not have ſpoken thus of God and of His <hi>Work,</hi> if <hi>God</hi> had not ſpoken of Himſelf to him. And yet we cannot now poſſibly conceive of any other <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> of Working worthy of the great GOD! and therefore we know that God ſpake by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of all viſible, <hi>material</hi> Things, which ſhould be <hi>firſt</hi> in Order of <hi>Time,</hi> and which is firſt in Order
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003887_0011_10020CA54DE55B98"/>of <hi>Nature,</hi> Uſe, Influence and Dignity, but LIGHT? By <hi>this</hi> all Things are ſeen, pervaded and enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For <hi>Heat</hi> accompanies Light, and it is (under the Will and Power of GOD) <hi>vital</hi> to all Things that live, grow and move, or act upon Earth.</p>
            <p>That <hi>firſt Light</hi> was pleaſant to the ſurrounding Hoſts of <hi>Angels,</hi> how far ſoever it was below <hi>That</hi> of <hi>their</hi> Celeſtial Regions. From their high World of Light and Glory they came to ſee a new World of Material Beauties and Splendors riſing from a <hi>Chaos.</hi> They heard the Voice from the Heavenly Glory ſay, Let <hi>Light</hi> be here below! and they ſaw it to be <hi>very good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>GOD is Light.</hi> So He repreſents Himſelf unto us, becauſe Light is the <hi>firſt-born</hi> of the Viſible Creation. How does it <hi>excel</hi> Darkneſs! how did it ſpring forth <hi>out</hi> of Darkneſs, and ſhine in the Eyes of admiring Angels! <hi>Hail, Holy Light!</hi> they cried: Our <hi>Milton</hi> learn'd it of Them in his <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And ſo our late <hi>Angel</hi> of a Man, Mr. <hi>Henry</hi> in his Expoſition: <q>
                  <hi>Light</hi> ſays he, which of all Things ſeen does moſt reſemble it's great <hi>Parent</hi> in Beauty and Bleſſings, in Purity Brightneſs and Beneficence, in Spirituality Immenſity and Immutability.</q>
            </p>
            <p>GOD is the <hi>Father of Light, from Whom every good and perfect Gift comes down; and with Him there is no Variableneſs, nor Shadow of Change.</hi> So in the <hi>New Creation</hi> Light is the <hi>firſt</hi> Thing formed. GOD <hi>gives the Light of the Knowledge</hi> of his more Spiritual <hi>Glory, in the Face of</hi> JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Order</hi> of the Creation is <hi>admirable</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect</hi> as it is related by <hi>Moſes;</hi> yet it could not have enter'd into the Heart of <hi>Man</hi> to have conceived of it, if God had not revealed it to Him. As ſoon as the Light ſhone out of Darkneſs, God ſtretched out a <hi>Firmament,</hi> He made an <hi>Atmoſphere</hi> about
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:003887_0012_10020C4E3711CF10"/>the Earth, an Expanſion of <hi>Air,</hi> the higher and lower Region of it, of various Uſe and vaſt Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and of the laſt Neceſſity for the Growth of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Vegetable,</hi> and for the Life and Motion of every <hi>Animal.</hi> The Maſs of Water and Earth was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by left a diſtinct Body by it ſelf. In this <hi>Firmament</hi> of Heaven the <hi>Vapours</hi> aſcend from the Ends of the Earth, the <hi>Winds</hi> blow, the <hi>Clouds</hi> roll, and God rides on them, &amp; plays his dreadful Artillery, the <hi>Lightning and Thunder,</hi> which purifies the Air for us, while it makes us tremble.

               </gap>ndly <hi>deceives</hi> our Sight, and makes Things ſeem <hi>near</hi> to us at inconceivable Diſtances, and our Eyes receive Objects thro' an immeaſurable Space, the <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> with Eaſe and Pleaſure. Hereby the Light and Heat and Rains <hi>deſcend</hi> on us, in fit Proportions to make the Earth fruitful; the Graſs grows for the <hi>Cattle,</hi> Herbs and Corn and Fruits for the Service of <hi>Man;</hi> the glorious Works of God are <hi>ſeen</hi> and contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated by us, and vital <hi>Heat</hi> is convey'd to our Hearts, and preſerv'd in our Blood. — Such is the <hi>Firmament</hi> which God has ſpread over us, <hi>the Pavement of his Feet,</hi> but <hi>the Breath of our Noſtrils. Moſes</hi> has told of <hi>it,</hi> as the wondrous Work of God, accompanying the <hi>Light,</hi> which how ſhould it <hi>glare,</hi> or be at all viſible, but thro' a Vehicle of <hi>Air?</hi> In <hi>this,</hi> under God, whoſe Viſitation pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves our Spirits, <hi>we live and move and have our Being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now God gather'd the Maſs of <hi>lower Waters</hi> into one Place, into one vaſt Body, or Collection of it, and the <hi>dry Land</hi> appeared. <q>
                  <hi>The Sea is His for he made it; &amp; his Hands formed the dry Ground: In his Hands are the deep Places of the Earth, &amp; the Strength of the Hills is his alſo.</hi>
               </q> GOD formed it a <hi>Terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queous Globe,</hi> Land and Water; both alike neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and beauteous in their Kind and Place. He
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003887_0013_10020CA99B08F1B8"/>bad the <hi>Earth</hi> to bring forth the Graſs and Herb and Trees, even before there was a <hi>Sun</hi> in the Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament of Heaven, ſay <hi>ſome;</hi> but <hi>others</hi> chuſe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſay, before its Heat and Light <hi>broke thro'</hi> the exhaled Vapours, drank up the <hi>dark Waters</hi> and ſcatter'd the <hi>thick Clouds of the Sky.</hi> The Moon and Stars then appeared in their Courſes, and Day and Night commenced, Months and Years. The ſame <hi>Circle</hi> and <hi>Syſtem of Planets</hi> and <hi>fix'd Stars,</hi> which are beheld by us at this Day, but can never be eno' admir'd by the Sons of Men, <hi>ſhone out</hi> at once on this Terraqueous Globe of ours.</p>
            <p>But as yet no <hi>Eye</hi> was formed to behold and view them; no not ſo much as the Eye of a <hi>Fiſh</hi> in the Waters of an <hi>Animal</hi> on the Land, or of an <hi>Inſect</hi> in the Air. Now therefore it pleaſed God to command the Waters to bring forth the <hi>moving Creatures</hi> in them, great and ſmall; and the <hi>Fowl</hi> to fly in the open Firmament. He fill'd the <hi>Sea</hi> with Fiſh, and things creeping innumerable; and the <hi>Air</hi> with feather'd Fowl, of every Wing and Size. Angels beheld with vaſt Delight the <hi>Life,</hi> the Beauties and Motion of them all. — Who could have led <hi>Moſes</hi> down into and thro' theſe <hi>Depths</hi> of the Sea, and up into all theſe <hi>Heights</hi> of the Air, to trace out the Original of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of both; but only GOD the Former of them all, and the Fountain of <hi>Life</hi> unto all? For there is not the moſt inferior Life in Air or Water, but what loudly tells us of the <hi>living</hi> JEHOVAH, the GOD of <hi>Moſes, Who only hath Life in Himſelf, and giveth unto all Life and Breath and all things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God made 'em to <hi>propagate</hi> their Life; to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, multiply in, and repleniſh the Sea, the Air and Earth. He added his <hi>Bleſſing</hi> on Them for this End, which is effectual to this Day, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which every living Thing had been <hi>barren</hi> and
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003887_0014_10020C55AF0D6518"/>fruitleſs for Ever.—O the <hi>Riches,</hi> and Profuſion of <hi>Bounty,</hi> in the Living Creatures that <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate</hi> the Life-which they receive, thro' all <hi>Ages</hi> of the World, as long as <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Sun</hi> and <hi>Moon</hi> ſhall endure.</p>
            <p>This Power and Goodneſs <hi>inexhauſtible</hi> flowed on, and roſe higher and higher, till the <hi>dry Land</hi> was alſo ſtor'd with <hi>Beaſts,</hi> and <hi>Cattle</hi> and <hi>every creeping Thing</hi> after their Kind; and then MAN was laſt of all formed, with a <hi>Solemnity</hi> and <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> peculiar to the <hi>Superior Creature</hi> on Earth; deſigned to be the <hi>Lord</hi> of all the Creatures in Air, on Earth and in the Seas, and to bear the <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Likeneſs</hi> of the CREATOR of all. Gen. i. 26, 27. —ii. 7. <hi>And God ſaid, Let us make Man in our I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, after our Likeneſs: and let Them have Dominion over the Fiſh of the Sea, and over the Fowl of the Air, and over the Cattle, and over all the Earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth. So God created Man in His own Image, in the Image of God created He him; Male and Female created He them: And God bleſſed them, and ſaid unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and repleniſh the Earth, and ſubdue it; and have Dominion &amp;c:— The Lord God formed Man of the Duſt of the Ground and breathed into his Noſtrils the Breath of Life, and Man became a Living Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What ſhould be the <hi>Image</hi> of the LIVING GOD, in Heaven or on Earth, but <hi>living Spirits?</hi> intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and immortal Creatures, made after the Power of an <hi>endleſs Life.</hi> Who but <hi>Theſe</hi> ſhould be made for <hi>Dominion</hi> in one World or the other? God is the <hi>Father of Spirits</hi> and the <hi>Fountain of Life.</hi> The Life of <hi>Angels</hi> and of <hi>Souls</hi> is of Him and to Him. The <hi>living Beings</hi> in every World muſt worſhip <hi>Him that liveth for ever and ever,</hi> and caſt their <hi>Crowns</hi> before His Throne; for they are all <hi>crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> with Glory and Honour, in <hi>His Image</hi> on them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:003887_0015_10020CAB3388C3A8"/>
GOD is the BEING <hi>of Beings:</hi> I AM THAT I AM is his Name. JEHOVAH is but the ſame Name. <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Immenſity and Immutability</hi> go into the full Meaning of it. And all theſe alſo go into every <hi>moral Perfection</hi> of the Divine Nature. God is therefore a <q>SPIRIT infinite, eternal, unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his Being, Wiſdom, Power, Holineſs, Juſtice, Goodneſs and Truth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Man in his <hi>Immortality</hi> may be ſaid to bear <hi>ſome</hi> Image of the <hi>Everlaſting Life</hi> of God. But the <hi>Moral Perfections</hi> of God muſt <hi>neceſſarily</hi> be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to Reaſonable Creatures, in a Degree and Meaſure ſuitable to their Place in the Creation of God, in order to their Acting wiſely, holily, juſtly; with Goodneſs and Truth. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us that <hi>this</hi> was the Image and Likeneſs of God, wherein Man was created, and to which He is in part reſtored in his Sanctification. Eph. iv. 24. <hi>Renewed in the Spirit of your Mind, and after God created in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs.</hi> Col. iii. 10. Renewed in Knowledge, after the Image of Him that created him.</p>
            <p>MAN is a <hi>living Soul,</hi> not only in reſpect of Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, but as he is an <hi>Intelligent, Self-conſcious</hi> Creature, made a <hi>Law</hi> to Himſelf, and for <hi>Self-Government;</hi> an Agent by Counſel, accountable to <hi>God,</hi> to his own <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and to the <hi>Societies</hi> to which he belongs. He feels and ſhows <hi>the Work of the Law written in his Heart, his Conſcience bearing him Witneſs, and his Thoughts excuſing or accuſing,</hi> and binding him over to the Eternal <hi>Judgment</hi> of God, Rom. ii. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Senſe, Reaſon and Experience do all teſtify to us that the other <hi>Animals</hi> on Earth are not ſuch <hi>Living Souls,</hi> as theſe which we feel within our Selves. As they have no Conſcience of Right and Wrong, ſo no Knowledge or Fear of a holy Maker and Judge. They are not capable of contemplat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003887_0016_10020CAD4E978CC8"/>God in his Works, nor of giving Glory to him in Acts of Worſhip and Obedience. But <hi>the Soul of Man</hi> is as evidently made for thoſe Exerciſes of Religion, to <hi>glorify God with his Body and Spirit;</hi> having the <hi>Preſages</hi> of a future and everlaſting State in preſent Hopes and Fears.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>Moſes</hi> is the <hi>firſt</hi> who told the Sons and Daughters of Men in <hi>Writing</hi> of their being cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated theſe <hi>living Souls,</hi> for theſe ſuperior and holy Ends. And this is the <hi>firſt Thing</hi> he tells them concerning Themſelves, which highly becomes a <hi>Revelation</hi> from God, to let us know our Selves to be the <hi>Offspring of God;</hi> that He has <hi>taught us more than the Beaſts of the Earth, and made us Wiſer than the Fowls of Heaven,</hi> and expects more from us. This ſtands excellently well in the Account given us of our <hi>Creation.</hi> God knows the <hi>Soul</hi> which he has made, and tells it <hi>what</hi> it is, &amp; leads it to <hi>Himſelf,</hi> by ſhowing it his own <hi>Image</hi> in it ſelf.</p>
            <p>No Writer before <hi>Moſes</hi> has told Mankind how they came into Being, in what a <hi>Glory</hi> they were created, in what Rectitude and Perfection. And ſurely a Revelation from God to Man ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with ſuch an Account of his <hi>Original</hi> and firſt State; "<hi>Who</hi> made him, <hi>how</hi> he was made, <hi>what</hi> he was made for; that God made him <hi>very good,</hi> and <hi>for Himſelf;</hi> for Glory <hi>to</hi> Himſelf from Man, and for Bleſſedneſs <hi>in</hi> Himſelf unto him.</p>
            <p>Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> writes of GOD who was before the World, and of His making it in ſuch a Manner as becomes the Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Holineſs and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Power of God. <hi>Moſes</hi> could never have undertaken and perform'd <hi>This,</hi> but under the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of God. <hi>Known to</hi> HIM, and to Him alone, <hi>are all his Works from the Beginning to the End.</hi> Had <hi>Moſes,</hi> or any <hi>One</hi> elſe, preſum'd to have told the Manner and Order of the Creation
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003887_0017_10020CB08EA9CCA8"/>of their own Head, they had juſtly incurr'd the fearful Words of the ALMIGHTY <hi>out of the Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind,</hi> Job xxxviii. 2,—6. <hi>Who is this that darkneth Counſel by Words without Knowledge? Gird up now thy Loyns like a Man; for I will demand of thee and anſwer thou Me. Where waſt thou when I laid the Foundation of the Earth? declare if thou haſt Underſtanding. Who laid the Meaſures thereof; if thou knoweſt? or who hath ſtretched the Line up in it? Whereupon are the Foundations thereof faſtned? or who laid the Corner-ſtone thereof? Or who ſhut up the Sea with Doors,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> was the <hi>boldeſt</hi> Man that ever wrote, the moſt <hi>daring</hi> and inſolent, if <hi>not inſpired</hi> from on High. Yet what can be more <hi>Reverend</hi> and <hi>Aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> before God, than all his Words concerning Him and his Works! — What a Preſumption had it been to have pretended to tell, Who the <hi>firſt Parents</hi> of Mankind were, how they came into Being, what God ſaid to them, where he put 'em, and how they behav'd; if it were not from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Tradition</hi> from the Mouth of <hi>Adam,</hi> or by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate <hi>Inſpiration</hi> from Heaven? This Man <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> the wiſeſt and <hi>meekeſt</hi> upon Earth, had ſhown himſelf the <hi>vaineſt</hi> and proudeſt, to write as he did at the End of <hi>two Thouſand Years,</hi> without a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Record</hi> left him to copy after, or the certain <hi>Impulſe</hi> and Dictate of the SPIRIT OF GOD. But if God ſpake to him, and by him of his own Work, then the <hi>meeker</hi> he was the more ſutable for God to ſpeak by; for <hi>He reſiſteth the proud and giveth Grace unto the lowly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It looks indeed as if God ſpake to <hi>Moſes</hi> in that he tells us that <hi>Man</hi> was created <hi>laſt</hi> of all the Works of God upon Earth. The Earth and the Creatures on it were made <hi>for Man,</hi> by <hi>Moſes</hi> his Account; no doubt therefore but they were made <hi>before</hi> him. Man being the Top, the Crown, and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003887_0018_10020C7F86299B30"/>
               <hi>Lord</hi> of the lower Creation, it was finiſhed and perfected in his Formation. It agrees to the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Goodneſs and Bounty of the Great CREATOR, that it was ſo. Thro' the whole Creation the <hi>leſs perfect</hi> was created <hi>firſt.</hi> The Advance is <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual,</hi> by <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Account; from Earth to Graſs, from Graſs and Trees to Cattle &amp; creeping Things, and then to <hi>Man</hi> in the Image of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Man</hi> had no more any Hand in his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into Being, than any of the Inferiour Creatures. <q>It was an <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> to Him to be made <hi>laſt.</hi> God built and furniſh'd him a <hi>Palace</hi> for his Reception, being deſign'd to be the <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Vicercy</hi> here below.</q> He did not come into an empty <hi>naked</hi> World, but found it richly <hi>ſtor'd</hi> with every Beauty and Bounty for Soul and Body. He had the <hi>Glories</hi> of the whole finiſhed Creation for his <hi>Mind</hi> to contemplate, and all the <hi>Stores</hi> of Nature to regale his <hi>Appetite.</hi> Here was every Thing for Delight as well as Need; all that his Soul could wiſh for: Eno' to entertain his <hi>Wonder</hi> and raiſe his <hi>Gratitude,</hi> and fill him with <hi>Adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> This was as became the Work of God.</p>
            <p>Again that <hi>Man</hi> ſhould be created with <hi>more So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, Pauſe</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> than the other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as <hi>Moſes</hi> relates, is a Circumſtance as credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as it is agreable.

               </q> but when the Formation of Man comes on the <hi>Style</hi> alters; and Reaſon good, on the Account of GOD, in whoſe Image Man was to be made. The words of God therefore were, <q>

He ſpake of Him, as he made him, as having a ſpecial <hi>Delight in the Sons of Men; "Let Us make Man, Our own Image</hi> upon Earth, a <hi>living Spirit,</hi> a rational &amp; immortal Soul. This is ſaid for <hi>Man's</hi> ſake, as if he call'd <hi>a Council</hi> about forming him; that Man might reverence <hi>Himſelf,</hi> and love and praiſe his <hi>Maker.</hi> q. d. Let Us form this Creature for <hi>Our Self,</hi> in Knowledge and Sanctity, and for Immortality; to worſhip and obey Us, and be bleſſed in the High Enjoyment of our Favour for Evermore.</p>
            <p>Man is <hi>ſacred</hi> and dedicated to that Glorious TRINITY or GODHEAD, Who thus ſpake of him in the Day of his Creation.

The</hi> SPIRIT <hi>of God hath made me, and the Inſpiration of the</hi> ALMIGHTY <hi>giveth me Underſtanding: For the Spirit of Man is the Candle of the</hi> LORD. <hi>Moſes</hi> his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Man's Formation highly becomes a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo Endowed from on High. The whole Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is worthy of GOD and of his Work. <hi>Leſs</hi> ſhould not be ſaid of it, and <hi>more</hi> ought not.</p>
            <p>To go on: That Man ſhould be created <hi>Male and Female,</hi> and but <hi>one Man and Woman,</hi> highly agrees to the Wiſdom and Purity of God. That it <hi>was ſo,</hi> none but God could tell; unleſs the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition might be had from <hi>Adam</hi> and his immediate
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003887_0020_10020CB45F986100"/>Sons. That it <hi>ſhould</hi> be ſo is in all reſpects deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Even that all Mankind, thro'out all Ages, might be <hi>of one Blood,</hi> one Family, the Children of one Father and Mother, and love accordingly: And that according to the Original Pattern, only one Man and one Woman ſhould joyn themſelves in <hi>Marriage</hi> thro' all Generations; to preſerve a chaſte, a godly, a robuſt and healthy, and ſo a happy <hi>Seed.</hi> This is the <hi>Reaſoning</hi> of the HOLY GHOST upon this Subject, toward the End of the <hi>Old Teſtament:</hi> Mal. ii. 15. <hi>Did He not make One? yet had He the Reſidue of the Spirit: And wherefore One? that He might ſeek a godly Seed. Wherefore take Heed to your Spirit, that none deal treacherouſly with the Wife of his Youth.</hi> The plain Meaning of the <hi>Prophet</hi> is this, God made but <hi>one Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> at firſt, as <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us. He could have made <hi>ten</hi> or <hi>twenty Females</hi> for the ſpeedy Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Mankind, and to repleniſh the Earth, faſt with Inhabitants. And if ever there could be Reaſon to think that God would allow more than <hi>one</hi> Woman to a Man, it had been to <hi>Adam,</hi> when the whole Earth was without another Inhabitant, and it could be peopled but very ſlowly from one Pair. Yet even in this Caſe God made but one <hi>Eve,</hi> and inſtituted the Purity of the Marriage Bed therein; that no one in any Caſe, or on any Pretence, ſhould ever take more Wives than one at a Time, or break the Marriage Covenant by luſting after any other Woman. — And now, how worthy this Account of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> alone in the World, is of God their Maker, let the Experience of all the World ſpeak, from the manifeſt and manifold Confuſions to Perſons and Families, to Body Soul and Eſtate, from having more Wives than one, or from the impure Mixtures of Fornication and Adultery. How neceſſary and honourable is Chaſtity and <hi>holy Matrimony</hi> to Mankind, whether we conſider our
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:003887_0021_10020C5A50D68C00"/>ſelves as reaſonable, or as religious ſocial Creatures? The bodily Health is conſulted by the Law of <hi>Marriage,</hi> and the Health of the Soul more: It was meet therefore for the Father and Preſerver of Men to make This one of his <hi>firſt</hi> Laws and Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, as <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us He did.</p>
            <p>As One ſays, <q>Since <hi>Adam</hi> was confined to one Wife, it is a ſufficient Intimation that his <hi>Sons</hi> ſhould be ſo; and that the Bond of Marriage is not to be diſſolved at Pleaſure.</q> So our <hi>Lord</hi> JESUS has taught us to reaſon; Mat. xix. 3,—8. <hi>The Phariſees came unto Him, tempting him and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, "Is it lawful for a Man to put away his Wife for every Cauſe? And he anſwered and ſaid unto them, "Have ye not read, that He which made them at the Beginning, made them Male and Female? and ſaid, For this Cauſe ſhall a Man leave Father and Mother, and ſhall cleave unto his Wife; and they twain ſhall be one Fleſh. Wherefore they are no more twain, but one Fleſh. What therefore God hath joyned together, let not Man put aſunder. They ſoy unto Him, Why did Moſes then command to give a Writing of Divorcement, and put her away? He ſaith unto them, Moſes becauſe of the Hardneſs of your Hearts ſuffered you to put away your Wives; but from the Beginning it was not ſo.</hi> No Permiſſion or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence to any in Times paſt, no not to <hi>Abraham</hi> or <hi>Jacob</hi> themſelves, or to any of their Poſterity, may be pleaded for an Exemption from this <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> Intention and <hi>Conſtitution</hi> in Man's <hi>Creation;</hi> but this muſt determine Us, — <hi>Adam</hi> had but one Wife, <hi>"Eve</hi> had but one Husband.</p>
            <p>In the next place, <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us that as ſoon as God had form'd this <hi>lovely happy Pair,</hi> and brought them together, <hi>He bleſſed them.</hi> A Particular truly becoming the <hi>Father of their Spirits;</hi> the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> of their Bodies, and the Lover of his <hi>Own Image</hi> in them. He had made 'em holy, wiſe, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:003887_0022_10020CB608A52A50"/>for Happineſs in one another, and for Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs in Himſelf and in a better Life; and no wonder that He <hi>bleſſed</hi> 'em, rejoycing in his own Work. He bleſſed the <hi>Fiſh</hi> and the <hi>Fowl</hi> as they came into <hi>Being,</hi> and ſo the other Living Creatures that were made to propagate and multiply; for his Work was all <hi>Honourable and Glorious;</hi> but the Bleſſing of <hi>Man</hi> far excecded that on the inferior Creatures; as He was made greater and better than they. — Let the Sons and Daughters of Men know, that God moſt High is as ready to <hi>bleſs</hi> 'em all as to make 'em; and to bleſs 'em particularly in their <hi>Marriage</hi> and <hi>Family</hi> Relation: And that as he has fill'd this World with Variety of <hi>Bleſſings</hi> for them, ſo he gives them with a Bleſſing, and has <hi>greater</hi> Bleſſings than theſe in Store for them, if they will know and love and fear their MAKER; even all <hi>Spiritual Bleſſings in Heavenly Places in</hi> CHRIST JESUS.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> certainly wrote as <hi>an Hiſtorian from GOD,</hi> in telling us with what <hi>Pleaſure</hi> God looked on <hi>Man,</hi> and on the inferior Creatures alſo, in the Day he made 'em; and how he beſtow'd <hi>his Bleſſing</hi> on them. It belongs to a <hi>Father</hi> to bleſs his <hi>Offſpring,</hi> from the Love he bears to 'em. And could it be poſſible that God ſhould make <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in his own <hi>Likeneſs,</hi> and put them together, without a ſolemn <hi>Benediction?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this <hi>Bleſſing</hi> God join'd them together in <hi>Holy Marriage,</hi> — And O what a <hi>Wedding</hi> was it! God gave the <hi>Bride,</hi> and bleſs'd the <hi>Match</hi> of his own making.— This Inſtitution of Marriage, upon the Formation of Man <hi>male and female,</hi> is a pure and evident Token <hi>that God ſpake by Moſes.</hi> It agrees to the whole after Current of <hi>Scripture,</hi> thro' both <hi>Teſtaments;</hi> to the <hi>Seventh Commandment</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and that <hi>every One poſſeſs himſelf in Sanctification and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

To go on. By <hi>Moſes</hi> Account of the firſt State of Man, it appears that <hi>Adam and Eve</hi> were cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated with <hi>Underſtanding</hi> and <hi>Speech,</hi> and with the <hi>Powers of Reaſon in Perfection:</hi> Alſo with a Knowledge of the <hi>Brute Creatures</hi> neceſſary for <hi>their Dominion</hi> over them: And moreover, that in Things <hi>neceſſary</hi> for them to know, but <hi>above the Reach</hi> of Humane Underſtanding, they were favoured with <hi>Supernatural Revelations,</hi> or <hi>Inſpiration</hi> from on High. And certainly <hi>this</hi> is as became <hi>Him</hi> whoſe Work is <hi>perfect,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held it and lo it was all <hi>very good.</hi> It was neceſſary for <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> to be endowed with Knowledge and Speech, and not to have Theſe to acquire; for then had the lower Creation been without a Head or Ruler, and the Work of God had herein been greatly defective. — <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us therefore that as ſoon as our firſt Parents were created, <hi>God</hi> ſpake to them, and <hi>They</hi> to one another. God made Man a <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Mouth,</hi> and inſpired him with a Knowledge of <hi>Himſelf</hi> and of his MAKER. The Man and his Wife upon the firſt Sight of each other had a perfect Apprehenſion of their <hi>Relation</hi> and mutual Obligations; and knew Themſelves to be deſigned <hi>Parents</hi> of a numerous Poſterity, to people the Earth. — They knew alſo, by <hi>Moſes</hi> Account, all the <hi>Beaſts</hi> of the Earth; had an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding given them of the Nature of the <hi>brute Creatures;</hi> who were therefore bro't to <hi>Adam</hi> to receive their <hi>Names</hi> from him; which was his firſt act of <hi>Dominion</hi> over 'em, and a wondrous Proof of their Subjection to him, and a much more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Evidence of that <hi>natural Wiſdom and Saga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> with which he was endued: That at the firſt Sight of any of the Creatures he could <hi>look into them,</hi> ſee their different Natures, and <hi>name</hi> them agreably.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:003887_0024_10020CB864E1FC70"/>
It was a myſterious Dominion that <hi>Adam</hi> enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, incircled by the various inferior Creatures, the Lion and the Bear together with the Sheep and Doves, to know what he wou'd call 'em. Gen. ii. 19, 20. <hi>Out of the Ground the Lord God formed every Beaſt of the Field, and every Fowl of the Air, and bro't them to Adam to ſee what he would call them; and whatſoever Adam called every living Creature, that was the Name thereof.</hi> Methinks the <hi>Angels</hi> miniſtred with Pleaſure on this Occaſion, &amp; heard the Man give every Creature its proper Name. Or rather as One ſays, <q>
                  <hi>God</hi> by a ſpecial Inſtinct di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected 'em to come to Man as their Maſter and Owner. God gave him Livery and Seiſin of them all, as the fair and great Eſtate he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed him with, and put him in Poſſeſſion of it all. The Creatures, as it were, did Homage to Him as their <hi>Sovereign.</hi>
               </q> And they would have remain'd <hi>obedient</hi> to him, if he had been ſo unto his God. But when he loſt the <hi>Image</hi> of his God, the Creatures loſt alſo their Awe and Fear of him. All this now is worthy of <hi>God,</hi> and honorary to <hi>Man</hi> in his firſt State.</p>
            <p>See again what a mighty Knowledge <hi>Adam</hi> was inſpired with on <hi>his firſt Sight of Eve.</hi> Read how he received Her from the Hand of God, into his own Arms. Words worthy to be written with <hi>a Pen of Gold,</hi> and graven with <hi>a Diamond</hi> on the Heart of all his Offspring. Gen. ii. 22, — 25. <hi>And the Rib which the</hi> LORD GOD <hi>had taken from Man made He a Woman, and bro't her to the Man. And Adam ſaid, "This is now Bone of my Bone, and Fleſh of my Fleſh! She ſhall be called Woman, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſhe was taken out of Man. Therefore ſhall a Man leave his Father and his Mother, and ſhall cleave unto his Wife; and They ſhall be one Fleſh. And they were both naked, the Man and his Wife, and were not aſhamed.</hi>

               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:003887_0025_10020CBB29A21C90"/>
He knew her to be a <hi>Rib</hi> of Himſelf, his own Fleſh and Blood, taken from his very <hi>Heart,</hi> as ſoon as he ſaw her. So <hi>Chriſt</hi> loves his <hi>Church,</hi> for out of his own <hi>Side</hi> it was formed. Who, but GOD only, could inſpire <hi>Adam,</hi> in a Moment, at firſt Sight of <hi>Eve,</hi> to cry out,—<hi>Bone of my Bone!</hi> a Piece of my ſelf! taken out of me, to be again Joyned with me, and be <hi>One</hi> with me for Ever! <hi>Therefore ſhall a Man leave his Father and Mother and cleave to his Wife!</hi> What a <hi>Prophecy</hi> was this! fulfilled thro' the Earth, however degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate it is become, unto this Day! How ſhould <hi>Adam</hi> in an Inſtant know any thing of being a <hi>Father &amp; Mother</hi> and of having <hi>Children!</hi> and what the <hi>Temper</hi> and <hi>Manner</hi> of theſe Children ſhould be, in this <hi>grand Article</hi> of Life, thro' all Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions! What a Flight and <hi>Compaſs</hi> of Thoughts was this! beyond the Ken of <hi>Angels,</hi> who look'd on and ſaw this Interview, and heard the Saluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and underſtood not one half of it. — This was the <hi>firſt</hi> Time, that by the Mouth of <hi>Man</hi> was made known to the <hi>Angels, the manifold Waſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"That <hi>Adam</hi> (ſays a late moſt Ingenious <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor</hi>

No Penetration of the Humane Mind, nothing but expreſs Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation from God to <hi>Adam,</hi> can account for this <hi>Prediction.</hi> — What <hi>Idea</hi>'s were here in <hi>Adam</hi>'s
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003887_0026_10020C63B9065BB0"/>Mind before there were any <hi>Objects</hi> for them! the Idea of Parent and Child, of the paternal &amp; filial Affection, and of a Love ſucceeding theſe and ſurmounting them, that ſhould be <hi>Univerſal</hi> thro' all the Generations of Men upon the Earth! Theſe are Perceptions, moſt agreable for <hi>Adam</hi> to have on the Sight of <hi>Eve,</hi> and yet utterly impoſſible for him to have in any natural Way."</p>
            <p>Nor is it conceivable that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhould <hi>imagine,</hi> and feign theſe Tho'ts for the Head and Mouth of <hi>Adam:</hi> But if <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote them from God, then all is plain and eaſie. The <hi>Revealer</hi> was the ſame both to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and what was <hi>Prophecy</hi> in One, was <hi>Hiſtory</hi> in the Other.</p>
            <p>And thus we ſee how worthy an Account we have from <hi>Moſes</hi> of the <hi>firſt State</hi> of Man, with reſpect unto that <hi>Perfection</hi> of Knowledge and Wiſdom in which he was created. Nothing could be more to the Glory of the CREATOR, nor be more honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>Creature,</hi> than this Account. Certainly the Wiſdom of <hi>Moſes</hi> could never have gone into all the Particulars before cited, but it is GOD has ſpoken to Him and by him. GOD who <hi>inſpired Adam</hi> to ſpeak and act, <hi>revealed it to Moſes;</hi> or it had never enter'd into his Heart.</p>
            <p>I paſs on to <hi>another</hi> Point, which <hi>Moſes</hi> could never have tho't of, and that is the Inſtitution of a SABBATH to Man, from the Day in which he was created; together with <hi>the Reaſon</hi> for God's Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the <hi>ſeventh</hi> Part of Time. Gen. ii. 1, 2, 3. <hi>Thus the Heavens and the Earth were finiſhed, and all the Hoſt of them; and on the ſeventh Day God ended his Work which he had made; and he reſted on the ſeventh Day from all his Work which he had made: And God bleſſed the Seventh Day and ſanctified it;
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003887_0027_10020CBCCFB3E9A8"/>becauſe that in it He had reſted from all his Work, which God had created and made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is highly agreable to <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and ſeems to me a plain <hi>Dictate</hi> of the Religion of <hi>Nature,</hi> that <hi>ſome Portion of Time be ſtatedly Holy to God,</hi> and for the Reverend <hi>Worſhip</hi> of Mankind, as Social Creatures<note n="‖" place="bottom">If God muſt be worſhipped, there muſt be a <hi>Time</hi> for it. The <hi>Author</hi> of all our Time deſerves a Share in it. The Affairs of <hi>this World</hi> can't claim it all; the Expectation of a <hi>better</hi> challenges a part. A Mind full of earthly Cares is unfit for Attendance on God. We may not take his Name <hi>lightly</hi> and in vain. The Time for Worſhip ſhould be ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it may be remembred and prepar'd for. One Day in <hi>Seven</hi> can't be tho't too much for God and our Souls. His Diguity and their Value forbid us to think ſo—See <hi>the Religion of</hi> JESUS <hi>delineated.</hi>
               </note>. What that <hi>Part</hi> of Time is, ſeems to me <hi>beyond</hi> the Power of Man's Reaſon to determine, whether a <hi>third,</hi> a <hi>fifth,</hi> a <hi>ſeventh,</hi> or a <hi>tenth.</hi> God muſt therefore <hi>reveal</hi> his Mind to Man in this Point. And He muſt do it <hi>early,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us he did, even <hi>as ſoon</hi> as the Creation was finiſhed. God let <hi>our Parents</hi> know immediately, that the <hi>Seventh</hi> Part of Time ſhould be for ever <hi>holy to Himſelf,</hi> and for Exerciſes of Worſhip unto <hi>Mankind,</hi> Solitary and Social, to all Generations.</p>
            <p>How well did this become the <hi>Proprietor</hi> and Lord of Man, <hi>Lord of his Life and Time,</hi> and of all his <hi>Powers,</hi> of Soul and Body! How did it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his own Glory, and his Creatures Duty and Happineſs! that Man ſhould render to Him a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual publick <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> as his <hi>Creator,</hi> and herein enjoy a ſtated bleſſed <hi>Communion</hi> with Him! growing in his Likeneſs and Love all his Days upon the Earth. God's Regards to Himſelf and us are manifeſt in a <hi>Sabbath.</hi> And it is meet to be his <hi>firſt</hi> Ordination to his Creature Man, his <hi>firſt</hi> Injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Commandment and Law to him; that Man's

            <p>Surely <hi>reveal'd</hi> Religion muſt <hi>begin</hi> with the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of a <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and it can <hi>ſubſiſt</hi> by nothing leſs than the Obſervation of it. The Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>this</hi> is a ſhining Ray on the Face of <hi>Moſes.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> Thing God provided for, was to be <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped</hi> by his Creature for ever, in the moſt open and ſolemn Manner: the Salvation of his Creature depended on it, and His own Glory from him. And none but <hi>Moſes</hi> ever gave the <hi>Reaſon</hi> why the <hi>Seventh</hi> Part of Time is ſacred to the Worſhip of God, namely, becauſe God had finiſhed his Work in the Space of <hi>ſix</hi> Days.</p>
            <p>Here is a ſufficient Reaſon why <hi>this</hi> is the Part of Time declared to be <hi>morally Holy,</hi> and therefore to be put into the <hi>Moral Law,</hi> when given from Heaven; as <hi>Exod.</hi> xx. 11. It is a <hi>Reaſon</hi> becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the MAKER of Man, his Lawgiver and Judge! meet to be given to <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe, and meet to be given from <hi>Sinai</hi> to the Church.</p>
            <p>The Sabbath was made <hi>for Man;</hi> as <hi>Chriſt</hi> has told us: Therefore as ſoon as <hi>Man</hi> was made the <hi>Sabbath</hi> was given to him. It is a <hi>good</hi> Day for Man, for <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> both; for our <hi>Families</hi> eſpecially, our <hi>Sons and Daughters,</hi> our <hi>Men and Maid Servants.</hi> Theſe therefore are <hi>named</hi> in the Commandment, and even the labouring <hi>Cattle</hi> at our Doors. <hi>Reſt is good,</hi> under the Curſe of Toil and Sweat which Sin has bro't upon us. But <hi>holy Work is better,</hi> the Exerciſe and even Labour of the Mind Heart and Affections, in Contemplation Prayer and Praiſe, in holy Communications, in reading preaching and hearing the Word of God. This is the <hi>true Reſt</hi> of a Soul devoted to God,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:003887_0029_10020CC0A74B72C0"/>and under the Attractions of Heaven, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Seaſons of God's own ſanctifying. See <hi>Pſalms</hi> xcii. 1,—5.cxi. 1,—4.</p>
            <p>Juſtly have the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> been always <hi>read</hi> in the worſhiping Aſſemblies, both of <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians, every Sabbath Day;</hi> He being the firſt Man that has written of a <hi>weekly Sabbath</hi> for Man, from the Beginning of the World unto the End of it.

No wonder then that <hi>this</hi> Number is honour'd thro' the <hi>Book of God. Noah</hi> waited <hi>Seven</hi> days, and ſent out the Dove again. <hi>Balaam</hi> ſeems to have a ſuperſtitious Regard to this Number; <hi>"Build me</hi> ſeven <hi>Altars, and prepare me</hi> ſeven <hi>Oxen.</hi> At <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> Years End was the <hi>Sabbatical Year,</hi> and the <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilee</hi> to the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> at the End of ſeven times ſeven.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventy Weeks</hi> (of Years) <hi>were determined upon the Holy City,</hi> in the Prophecies of <hi>Daniel,</hi> for the Coming of the <hi>Meſſiah, the Anointing of the moſt Holy.</hi> And if we look into the <hi>Revelations of John,</hi> the laſt Book of Scripture, the <hi>Sevens</hi> multiply upon us; the ſeven <hi>golden Candleſticks,</hi> ſeven <hi>Stars,</hi> ſeven <hi>Horns,</hi> ſeven <hi>Eyes,</hi> ſeven <hi>Angels,</hi> ſeven <hi>Spirits of God,</hi> ſeven <hi>Thunders,</hi> ſeven <hi>Vials,</hi> the ſeven <hi>laſt Plagues.</hi> There ſeems ſomething very particular in the HOLY GHOST's fixing ſo much upon <hi>this</hi> Number: And what ſhould be the <hi>Key</hi> to it? but the Beginning of the Writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the firſt <hi>Pages</hi> in the Book of God? his finiſhing his glorious Work in <hi>Six</hi> Days, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003887_0030_10020C688DCA26C0"/>the <hi>Seventh</hi> to be a Holy Sabbath to Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.— The Number <hi>Seven</hi> is made Honourable to us, both in the <hi>Works</hi> of God and alſo in his <hi>Word.</hi> His Word agrees with his Works herein, and it is a Teſtimony for <hi>Moſes</hi> that God ſpake by him.</p>
            <p>It ſhould endear and make Venerable the Name of <hi>Moſes</hi> to us, that we are thus let into the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a Sabbath</hi> to the Church and People of God thro' all Times. It was meet that the wiſe and good God ſhould <hi>fix</hi> it thus, and <hi>reveal</hi> it thus, from the Beginning. Mankind have <hi>never</hi> been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Sabbath, nor <hi>ever</hi> will be.— We thus <hi>triumph</hi> in the Sabbath day, and in <hi>Moſes</hi> by whom God made it known to us. We ſing <hi>the Song of Moſes</hi> and celebrate our Sabbaths. We remember that <hi>the firſt Thing</hi> he ſpeaks of to us from God is <hi>the Sabbath.</hi> We remember how <hi>awfully</hi> he charges us to obſerve and keep it. <hi>Exod.</hi> xxxi. 12, 13, 14. The Name of <hi>Moſes</hi> was venerable to <hi>Nehemiah</hi> on this Account. <hi>Nehem.</hi> ix. 13, 14.</p>
            <p>Let us keep the <hi>Holy Day</hi> with Joy, in Memory of the World's <hi>Nativity,</hi> in Remembrance of God our MAKER. Let us wiſh to keep our Sabbaths al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, as our <hi>firſt Parents</hi> did their <hi>firſt Day</hi> unto God. God ſanctify us on the Sabbath Day, as He has ſanctified that to us. Let us every <hi>Lord's day</hi> remember the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> God's Servant. Let <hi>Moſes</hi> the Servant, lead us to CHRIST, the SON, in his own Houſe. JESUS honoured the Sabbath, and did it greater Glory than <hi>Moſes. Moſes</hi> wrote of it, and JESUS wrought his Miracles of Grace on it. JESUS preach'd on it, ſo as never Man ſpake. The <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath was <hi>buried</hi> in the Grave of JESUS; the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Sabbath <hi>roſe</hi> with Him on the <hi>firſt</hi> Day of the Week. Then he <hi>reſted</hi> from his more glorious Work of our Redemption, made his <hi>Viſits</hi> and ſent down the HOLY SPIRIT thereon. We yet ſanctify the <hi>Seventh</hi> Part of Time, to the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003887_0031_10020CC39177DCE0"/>Honour of GOD our <hi>Maker, Redeemer &amp; Sanctifier,</hi> To the ONE GOD, <hi>Father, Son,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> be Glory in the Churches of his Saints, while Sun and Moon, Day and Night endure! <q>Glory be to the FATHER, to the SON, &amp; to the HOLY GHOST; as it was in the Beginning, is and ever ſhall be; World without End. Amen.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I have inſiſted the more upon this <hi>great</hi> Point, (the very <hi>firſt</hi> by <hi>Moſes</hi> Account after the Creation of <hi>Man,</hi> and of the laſt Importance to <hi>his</hi> Felicity and the CREATOR's Glory) becauſe I find it wholly omitted by a <hi>moſt Ingenious Writer,</hi> while he ſelects <hi>three</hi> other Things from <hi>Moſes</hi> Writings, which he well obſerves did require a <hi>Revelation</hi> in the State of <hi>Purity;</hi> namely, <hi>Food, Marriage</hi> and <hi>Language.</hi> But certainly the <hi>Sabbath</hi> ſtands as <hi>plain</hi> in <hi>Moſes</hi> Account, and equally call'd for a <hi>Revelation</hi> from God; even <hi>that Part of Time</hi> which ſhould be for ever ſacred from Man, to the ſolemn public Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God. For as Man was made for <hi>Worſhip,</hi> and alſo for <hi>worldly Works,</hi> ſo there muſt be a <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath,</hi> or holy Reſt, made for Man: That is to ſay, a <hi>Portion</hi> of Man's Time ſacred to God. Of <hi>this</hi> Man's Reaſon and Conſcience would eaſily tell him in his perfect State, but could not (I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) diſcover what that <hi>juſt Proportion</hi> was, <hi>Moſes</hi> lets us know that this call'd for a Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from God to <hi>Adam,</hi> and accordingly the LORD GOD ſeparated and bleſſed the <hi>ſeventh Day.</hi> That it <hi>muſt</hi> be a <hi>Seventh,</hi> and the Reaſon <hi>why</hi> a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, could be known only by <hi>Revelation.</hi> And this I take to be a <hi>grand</hi> Inſtance and Argument of the Credibility of <hi>Moſes</hi> Hiſtory; that whereas <hi>ſome</hi> Time <hi>muſt</hi> be Holy to God from Man, the <hi>Proportion</hi> is given by <hi>Him,</hi> and by <hi>none</hi> before him, with the moſt <hi>ſecret</hi> and <hi>illuſtrious</hi> Reaſon of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:003887_0032_10020CC5B7AD6EE8"/>
This <hi>Proportion</hi> of Man's <hi>Time</hi> is found by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience ſo convenient and ſufficient, that none can be fix'd on by the Wit of Man alike ſutable and fitting. And <hi>This</hi> is ſo <hi>great</hi> a Thing in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the Religion of <hi>Man,</hi> and in the Worſhip of <hi>God,</hi> and is ſo <hi>plain</hi> a Thing in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>Story,</hi> that I could by no Means <hi>omit</hi> it, nay could not but <hi>inlarge</hi> on it as a chief Strength and Beauty in the Argument before me. I wiſh that all Chriſtians were duly ſenſible how great a Thing the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is in true Religion, according to the <hi>Scriptures</hi> of God, from the Beginning to the End of the World.</p>
            <p>The <hi>only Exception</hi> to what I have advanced from this <hi>early</hi> Mention of the Inſtitution of a <hi>Sabbath</hi> in the Writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that I have met with, is this: <q>That we don't find the leaſt Hint of the <hi>Obſervation</hi> of a Sabbath in all the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal State</hi> from the Days of <hi>Adam</hi> to that of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and therefore it is probable that <hi>Moſes</hi> mention'd it in his Account of the Work of Creation <hi>only by Way of Anticipation,</hi> after he had received the <hi>Decalogue</hi> at <hi>Sinai;</hi> where finding it given as a <hi>Reaſon</hi> for the <hi>fourth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi> That in <hi>ſix Days</hi> the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Seas and all that in them is, and reſted the <hi>ſeventh Day,</hi> wherefore the Lord <hi>bleſſed</hi> the Sabbath Day and hallowed it; he from thence took <hi>Occaſion</hi> in the Beginning of his <hi>Hiſtory</hi> to mention God's <hi>reſting</hi> from all his Work, and bleſſing the <hi>Seventh Day.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>If this manner of <hi>Arguing</hi> had come from the Mouth of an <hi>Infidel,</hi> I ſhould have overlook'd the <hi>Weakneſs</hi> of it from his <hi>Prejudice</hi> againſt <hi>Revelation</hi> from God; but from the Pen of a <hi>Believer</hi> and a Chriſtian <hi>Doctor,</hi> I can impute it to nothing but his <hi>low Eſteem of the Sabbath,</hi> from an unhappy <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> in that too common <hi>Prejudice</hi> prevailing in
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003887_0033_10020CC76394CF78"/>ſome <hi>Chriſtian Schools,</hi> to the unknown Injury of true Religion and vital Piety. The <hi>Verity of Moſes</hi> is indeed impeached, as well as one eminent Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature of his <hi>Inſpiration</hi> from Heaven thrown up, by this lame Conceſſion, from the <hi>Silence</hi> of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> concerning the Obſervation of a Sabbath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Flood. Whereas the whole <hi>Current of Scripture</hi> from the Days of <hi>Moſes,</hi> thro' the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the <hi>Prophets, Evangeliſts</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> is ſtrong for a <hi>Weekly Sabbath,</hi> as a moſt neceſſary and important <hi>Means</hi> of Religion in the Church of God.— <q>Is it not then by far moſt probable, that the moſt <hi>Ancient Patriarchs</hi> did according to this early Appointment, recorded by <hi>Moſes,</hi> obſerve it as a Day of Reſt from Labour, and for the Worſhip of God their Creator? And that <hi>one Day in Seven,</hi> as divinely appointed, has run thro' <hi>all Diſpenſations,</hi> both before and after <hi>Moſes,</hi> and muſt remain to the End of the World<note n="‡" place="bottom">See a late Treatiſe, <hi>Faith and Practice,</hi> in 54. Sermons, on the Principal Heads of <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> Sermon 31,</note>?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Thing next related by <hi>Moſes</hi> is that a <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe</hi> was prepared for our <hi>firſt Parents,</hi> in their State of <hi>Innocence</hi> and Rectitude. The Earth was it ſelf indeed a Paradiſe, but ſome One of the fineſt and richeſt Spots in it was ſingled out for <hi>Man's</hi> firſt Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence &amp; Dwelling. Gen. ii. 8, 15. <hi>And the Lord God planted a Garden Eaſtward in Eden, and there He put the Man whom he had formed; to dreſs it and keep it; where He had made to grow every Tree that is pleaſant to the Sight and good for Food.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As the <hi>Sabbath</hi> had been given for the <hi>Soul,</hi> the better Part of Man, ſo was this <hi>Garden</hi> prepared for him as an <hi>imbodied</hi> Spirit; to gratify his <hi>Sight,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:003887_0034_10020C6E356C3178"/>Smell, Taſte</hi> and <hi>Hearing;</hi> by every <hi>Senſe,</hi> and Bounty of God, to draw forth his Heart to Him, his magnificent and munificent CREATOR.</p>
            <p>Here <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> walk'd together, contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated and diſcourſed, eat and worſhip'd. The <hi>Birds</hi> ſang in the Branches, the <hi>Trees</hi> were laden with painted <hi>Fruit,</hi> the <hi>Plants</hi> were covered with <hi>Flowers</hi> of the ſweeteſt Odour, and <hi>Streams</hi> of pure Water ran by the green ſhady Walks. A <hi>Scene</hi> meet to typify and repreſent the <hi>Heavenly Felicity,</hi> which is therefore call'd by the Name of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and figur'd out to us by the <hi>Garden of God</hi> with <hi>the Tree of Life</hi> in it. Rev. xxii. Man's firſt State continued in, had been as like to <hi>Heaven</hi> for Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, as could be on Earth.</p>
            <p>We read of <hi>the Trees of Eden in the Garden of God:</hi> Ezek. xxxi. 9. <hi>Eden</hi> ſignifies <hi>Pleaſure.</hi> That muſt needs be a Place of <hi>Delights,</hi> which is meet to be called <hi>the Garden of God.</hi> — What a <hi>Garden</hi> was this? of God's own forming and laying out? of his own ſettling and planting? of his own prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Creature of his peculiar Delight, made in his Image and Likeneſs? There was doubtleſs a <hi>Collection</hi> of every Thing <hi>pleaſant and fair for Delight,</hi> and all ranged in the moſt beauteous <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.—Souls</hi> know no higher <hi>Compariſon</hi> whereby to expreſs their <hi>Delights</hi> in GOD their Maker, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and Sanctifier; nor <hi>His</hi> in Them; in and with whom He ſtill <hi>walks</hi> as He did with <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> in <hi>Eden:</hi> Cant. iv12,—16.</p>
            <p>The Scituation of the <hi>Earthly Paradiſe</hi> ſeems to me a vain Enquiry. After <hi>Sin</hi> had blaſted it, it might become one of the moſt barren and waſte Places, even before the <hi>Flood;</hi> as the Garden of <hi>Iſrael</hi> became after their Iniquity and Puniſhment was full. The <hi>Flood</hi> tore the Surface of the Earth in pieces, and the Spot where Paradiſe was may be now a Lake of Water, or a craggy Rock. <hi>Moſes,</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:003887_0035_10020CC923D10588"/>I think, only pointed to the Place where about it was, by the new and preſent Rivers that are ſince the Diſruption of the Earth. We muſt no more think of any <hi>Paradiſe</hi> here below, there is no ſuch thing to be found. If there had ever been ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it had been in the Gardens of <hi>Solomon,</hi> but <hi>Vanity and Folly and Death</hi> ſoon convinc'd the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi> that no Labour or Expence of Man can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover any <hi>Earthly Paradiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And indeed the <hi>firſt</hi> Paradiſe had been nothing, without <hi>Purity,</hi> Rectitude and <hi>Immortality</hi> in it. As ſoon as <hi>Sin</hi> entered, and <hi>Death</hi> by Sin, Man found no more any Paradiſe in <hi>Eden,</hi> but fled, hid and was driven out of it. And ſo 'tis as to all our Imaginary Paradiſes <hi>regain</hi>'d here, in a State of Sin and Death. After all the Fatigue in the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Attempt for them, we muſt write on 'em the Words of <hi>Solomon,</hi> which in Effect call 'em <hi>a Fools Paradiſe,</hi> Eccl. ii. 4,—11.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Air</hi> without, and <hi>Wiſdom</hi> within, was ſuch in the <hi>Paradiſaic</hi> State, that our Parents needed no <hi>Covering. The Man and his Wife were naked, and were not aſhamed.</hi> This is admirably well ſaid of a State of Innocence and moral Perfection. The Purity and Wiſdom of God dwelt in them, and they could have nothing to bluſh at. This was the <hi>better,</hi> the Superior Part of Paradiſe; far more than all its delicious Fruits to the Eye or Palate, or than the perfum'd ſerene Air to their Noſtrils. Their Paradiſe was <hi>within Themſelves,</hi> and ſo is every wiſe and good Man's in the Grace of God within him. The obedient <hi>Animals</hi> about them were nothing to their own <hi>Obedience</hi> to God; His <hi>Spirit</hi> in 'em and <hi>Image</hi> on them. This made their Heart glad, their Face to ſhine, the Air calm, and the Fruits delicious. "By the Fall we have loſt, as <hi>One</hi> well obſerves, the true Notion of Honour and Shame". There is nothing ſhameful but <hi>Sin,</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:003887_0036_10020CCCD99FCC98"/>but every thing is good and great that belongs to Virtue and Sanctity. It is more than Chains to the Neck, Bracelets to the Arms, or a Crown for the Head. There is no Paradiſe <hi>regain'd,</hi> but in that <hi>Regeneration</hi> which CHRIST preach'd to <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi> and which his Goſpel produces in his Elect and Sanctified. We muſt be <hi>created</hi> anew <hi>after God,</hi> in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs, and be made <hi>New Creatures.</hi> This is the <hi>Shadow</hi> of the Paradiſe paſt, and the <hi>Earneſt</hi> of that to come.</p>
            <p>Let our Meditation of the <hi>One</hi> end in nothing ſhort of the <hi>Other.</hi> The <hi>Bible</hi> begins there and ends here. <hi>Rev.</hi> xxii. Surely it is as the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of God ſhould begin and end. God meant Man <hi>two Paradiſes,</hi> the one in the Way to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. By <hi>Adam</hi>'s loſing the firſt, the other alſo is loſt to moſt of his miſerable Children. If the <hi>firſt</hi> Paradiſe had been kept, dreſs'd and improved, we had not fail'd of the <hi>ſecond.</hi> But O the <hi>Shame</hi> and Miſery to Mankind, when we reflect — how <hi>ſoon</hi> the Enjoyments of a <hi>Paradiſe</hi> were all forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and loſt! all vilely thrown away as a Thing of nought!</p>
            <p>How ungrateful to God, and unnatural to Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, was <hi>this Sin</hi> of our firſt Parents! We are driven from the Joys of Paradiſe, into the ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Conſideration of the Crime and Guilt of <hi>Man's Apoſtacy.</hi> From a <hi>Garden</hi> of higheſt Peace and Pleaſure, we paſs into an <hi>Hoſpital</hi> of Diſeaſes, Sores, Pains, Anguiſhes both of Soul and Body! into the Agonies of <hi>Death,</hi> the Putrefaction of the <hi>Grave,</hi> and the Torments of <hi>Hell</hi> for Evermore.</p>
            <p>O diſmal <hi>Change</hi> of State and Place! from the Paradiſe of GOD, to the Pit of <hi>Devils.</hi> Legions of <hi>Angels</hi> had fell from the Heights of Heavenly Glory before this; had <hi>left their firſt State,</hi> and were <hi>caſt down into Hell.</hi> They are <hi>in Chains of Darkneſs reſerved unto Judgment,</hi> a Pet. ii. 4. Jude
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:003887_0037_10020CCE739988A0"/>v. 6. <hi>Lucifer,</hi> (the <hi>Prince</hi> of theſe fallen Angels, <hi>the Devil and Satan,</hi> that Son of <hi>Pride</hi> and Malice) could not bear to ſee <hi>a Spirit in Fleſh</hi> in the Image and Favour of God, in a <hi>Paradiſe</hi> on Earth, while <hi>he</hi> was ſunk down to Hell, accurſed. He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Spite to <hi>God</hi> and to his happy Creature <hi>Man,</hi> in his accurſed Hatred of the <hi>Image</hi> of God in <hi>One</hi> ſo much his Inferior in the Order of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, meditated (and alas accompliſh'd) Man's <hi>Loſs</hi> of his Original Holineſs, his <hi>Ejection</hi> from his earthly Paradiſe, his <hi>Forfeiture</hi> of the Heavenly, and <hi>Condemnation</hi> after him to a Hell of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Burnings. And now let us ſee <hi>by what Means</hi> he effected this his deviliſh Deſign.</p>
            <p>Only the Writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> let us into the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of Evil.</hi> That GOD is good, and that He muſt needs make all things <hi>good,</hi> and Man ſo in a ſingular manner, is agreed on all Hands. But <hi>whence</hi> then ſhould <hi>Evil</hi> come? This is a <hi>Difficulty</hi> that has puzzled all Men, who have not ſeen or us'd the Key of <hi>Scripture.</hi> That only opens to us <hi>the Gates of the Shadow of Death,</hi> and ſhows us the Goodneſs and Holineſs of God, without the leaſt Imputation from all the Miſery and Ruin, that Man by the Inſtigation of the Devil has bro't upon himſelf.</p>
            <p>The greateſt Wonder is, how <hi>Sin</hi> could enter into any of the <hi>Angels</hi> of God, in their Superior State of Knowledge and Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Holineſs. And the <hi>Gueſſes</hi> of learned &amp; pious Men are very vain, I fear, in this Point, if they venture further than the SPIRIT OF GOD has led 'em, in the few <hi>Hints</hi> given of this tremendous Matter in the <hi>written Word.</hi> There we read of <hi>the Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Devil,</hi> that it was for <hi>Pride:</hi> 1 Tim. iii. 6. The moſt probable Account that can be of the <hi>Sin of Angels:</hi> that there was ſome <hi>Diſcontent, Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:003887_0038_10020C734019E8D0"/>or <hi>Envying</hi> among them, or ſome <hi>Aſpiring</hi> to be as the MOST HIGH; to which Sin he prompted our Parents alſo, and prevailed.</p>
            <p>This was the <hi>Original</hi> of Sin and Miſery; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably long before our Earth was created and Man upon it. And when <hi>Angels</hi> ſaw the Delights of God <hi>in the Sons of Men</hi> and ſhouted for Joy, the <hi>Devils</hi> were filled with Madneſs and Vexation at it, and ſet themſelves to deſtroy this pleaſing Workmanſhip of God.</p>
            <p>We are greatly obliged to <hi>Moſes,</hi> in the Hand of GOD, for this Diſcovery to us of the <hi>Cauſe</hi> the Way and Means of our Ruin. We are deliver'd from the vain and <hi>abſurd</hi> Imagination which others have gone into of an <hi>Evil God,</hi> as well as a <hi>Good</hi> One. A moſt <hi>impious</hi> Principle, and pleaſing eno' to the <hi>Devil;</hi> to make a <hi>God</hi> of him, and give him a Throne like the <hi>Moſt High.</hi> A very grateful Return to Him for all the Miſchief he has done us!</p>
            <p>The <hi>Perſians</hi> went into this ridiculous Notion, which was the Reaſon of the Prophet's Words to <hi>Cyrus,</hi> the Anointed while yet unborn, in the Name of the LORD: Iſai. xlv. 5, 6, 7. <hi>I am the</hi> LORD, <hi>and there is none elſe, there is none beſide Me; I girded thee, tho' thou haſt not known Me: That they may know from the Riſing of the Sun and from the Weſt, that there is none beſide Me: I am the</hi> LORD <hi>and there is none elſe: I form the Light and create Darkneſs, I make Peace &amp; create Evil; I the</hi> LORD <hi>do all theſe things.</hi> You may be ready to think, this would miſlead the People of <hi>Cyrus</hi> into an ill Tho't of the <hi>Good God,</hi> as if he were the <hi>Author of Evil.</hi> But the plain Meaning is, that there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be <hi>two Gods,</hi> the one good and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evil; Oppoſites and Rivals to each Other; and that ſuch an Imagination ought never to have enter'd into their fooliſh blinded Hearts. For GOD is neceſſarily <hi>One only,</hi> and <hi>moſt Good;</hi> and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:003887_0039_10020CD07585D010"/>at firſt made all Things good, and forbad Evil to the uttermoſt. But intelligent Creatures ſinn'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their own Light, abus'd their Freedom, and bro't the Evil upon Themſelves. And now <hi>this Evil</hi> is under the wiſe and righteous Government of the <hi>Good God,</hi> is the Puniſhment of a wicked World, and over ruled by God to the moſt wiſe, good and holy Ends. Therefore there is but <hi>One Providence</hi> and Dominion over all, which is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether good and perfect, and in the Hand of the <hi>GOD of Iſrael,</hi> the one living and true God.</p>
            <p>Into all this Train of Truth and Religion to the <hi>One Eternal ſupream</hi> GOD, <hi>Moſes</hi> leads us by his Account of the <hi>Origine</hi> of Evil; telling us how God made Man very good and happy, and how ſoon he made himſelf ſinful and miſerable.</p>
            <p>But the Wonder then muſt be about the <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Means</hi> of Man's bringing himſelf under Sin and Miſery. And <hi>this</hi> is the <hi>Particular</hi> which <hi>Moſes</hi> (under the Inſpiration of God) has revealed to us. A Matter of the <hi>laſt</hi> Importance to the Honour of God, and for our Recovery to Him. And when we have conſidered <hi>Moſes</hi> his Account, we cannot conceive of any other, or like Way, for the <hi>Original</hi> of all the Evils, of Body and Soul, that we find our Selves under, from our Birth into the World, to our going out of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> therefore lets us know, in the <hi>firſt</hi> place; That God having made Man's <hi>Body</hi> to ſubſiſt and live <hi>by Food,</hi> growing out of the Earth; He im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately gave <hi>Direction</hi> to Man about his proper <hi>Food.</hi> Gen. i. 29. <hi>And God ſaid, Behold, I have given you every Herb bearing Seed, which is upon the Face of all the Earth; and every Tree yielding Fruit; to you it ſhall be for Meat. Moſes</hi> goes on in the next <hi>Chapter</hi> and tells us, <q>That the LORD GOD having planted the Garden in <hi>Eden</hi> for his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:003887_0040_10020CD24438B040"/>
                  <hi>Man,</hi> He fill'd it <hi>with every Tree pleaſant to the Eye and good for Food;</hi> and <hi>in the Midſt of the Garden he plac'd the Tree of Life,</hi> and alſo <hi>a Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil:</hi> And that <hi>the</hi> LORD GOD <hi>commanded the Man, ſaying, Of every Tree of the Garden thou mayeſt freely eat, out of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil thou ſhalt not eat of it; for in the Day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now what could be more <hi>good</hi> than all this? con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting the Honour of God and Man's Happineſs, in God's Government and Man's Obedience! and other Way for <hi>Either</hi> there could be none. What could <hi>the wiſe and holy</hi> ONE do more, or what leſs, to <hi>prevent</hi> the very Being and Knowledge of Evil? He forbid it on Pain of Death, he told our Parents the certain Conſequent of their Diſobedience to Him, in <hi>this</hi> or any other Particular; that it would be ALL EVIL to them, Death and Damnation to Body and Soul.</p>
            <p>It was in the Power and Will of Man now to have obey'd and continued happy; but to be ſure you would have tho't that he could never dare to offend in this particular Point, by <hi>Eating of the forbidden Tree,</hi> which carried <hi>the Knowledge of Evil</hi> in its Name. But God ſaw Man's Danger was here, in his <hi>Appetite,</hi> which it was fit to reſtrain and direct as to every thing that would be <hi>hurtful</hi> to the Life of the Body, and therein alſo to the Powers of the Soul; and whatſoever was not ſo, Man might be ſure his bountiful <hi>Maker</hi> would not prohibit to him.</p>
            <p>It ſeems very reaſonable to think, That Man in the Perfection of his Underſtanding needed the <hi>Direction</hi> of God, as <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us he had it, in reſpect of his proper <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>d.</hi> He was not created with a natural <hi>Inſtinct</hi> like the brute Creatures, which is to them a more <hi>infallible</hi> Direction than
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:003887_0041_10020C76B6CA90C8"/>
               <hi>Reaſon</hi> could be in the matter of Food. The Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were made to be govern'd only by <hi>Senſe,</hi> and a Senſe they have very <hi>perfect</hi> what to eat &amp; drink, and what not; even as if they knew and could ſay to themſelves, <q>This is good for me, and that would do me hurt; I chuſe this therefore as I ſhun that.</q>—<hi>Reaſon</hi> in Man was not prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily intended for theſe inferior Things, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was never meant to ſerve as <hi>Inſtinct</hi> does in the brute Kind the Purpoſes of <hi>Univerſal Senſe and Antipathy,</hi> which is neceſſary to their Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. <hi>Reaſon</hi> being given us for <hi>higher</hi> Uſes, Man ſeems to need a <hi>Revelation</hi> from God about his <hi>inferior</hi> Good, his <hi>Food.</hi> It is by Obſervation and <hi>Experience</hi> that Mankind get the Knowledge of Things noxious to Them, among the Herbs or Fruits of the Earth. And there being, let us ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>one</hi> Tree in the Midſt of the Garden of a <hi>poiſonous</hi> Nature to the Humane Body, God <hi>forbad</hi> it to Man, and made it the <hi>Trial</hi> of his Obedience; aſſuring him it would be <hi>deadly</hi> to him if he eat of it.</p>
            <p>I own, that it is not neceſſary for us to ſuppoſe this <hi>Poiſon</hi> in the forbidden Tree. It is eno' that God forbad it, were it never ſo good in it ſelf. <q>It was certainly intended <hi>to prove our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> whether they would continue good, or lapſe into known Evil.</q> They knew it would be <hi>good</hi> in them to abſtain and obey, and would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be very <hi>evil</hi> in them, and bring Evil on 'em to diſobey and eat. They could not think that God would have denied 'em this Tree, if it were not Evil for them in it ſelf, for any other End but the <hi>Trial</hi> of their Obedience, whether they would continue good.— Yet on the other Hand, there might be (for ought we know) a <hi>natural Evil</hi> to the Body of Man in this forbidden Tree. As we are told by <hi>Biſhop Patrick</hi> that many of the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:003887_0042_10020CD502C5E660"/>ſuppos'd there <q>was a Virtue in the <hi>Tree of Life</hi> to preſerve and maintain the Animal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and the bodily Organs, in that equal Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and State in which they were created.—</q> But as to <hi>This</hi> we may think differently, and yet not differ upon it. It comes to the ſame Thing, if with other <hi>Divines</hi> we judge the Tree of Life to have been only <q>a <hi>Sign and Seal</hi> of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of Life and Happineſs to <hi>Adam,</hi> even unto Immortality and everlaſting Bleſſedneſs, thro' the Grace and Favour of his Maker, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Condition of his Perſeverance in his State of Innocence and Obedience.</q> In like manner the <hi>Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil</hi> was at leaſt this, "A Sign and warning to <hi>Adam</hi> of the <hi>Loſs</hi> of Life and Happineſs, and of the ſad <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment</hi> of Evil in Soul and Body; and as ſuch it was forbidden him. — So that here were <hi>Life and Death,</hi> Bleſſing and Curſing, ſet before our firſt Parents, as in <hi>two Sacramental Signs &amp; Seals</hi> annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Covenant of Works.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, <hi>Moſes</hi> lets us know that Man's <hi>Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> both in Soul and Body was from his <hi>Sinning</hi> againſt God, and that the Sin of Man was his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging an <q>
                  <hi>irregular Appetite,</hi> in an Inſtance poſitively forbidden him, with a moſt plain Threatning of the mortal Effects of it<note n="|" place="bottom">See <hi>Revelation Examined,</hi> Diſſert. I.</note>
               </q> He tells us alſo the <hi>Temptation</hi> Man was under to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Sin, namely, to attain <hi>a higher Degree of Knowledge</hi> than he was made in. God had made him very <hi>knowing</hi> and happy in all Reſpects, and he ought to have been not only <hi>contented</hi> with, but very <hi>thankful</hi> for his Endowments and Enjoyments both intellectual and ſenſitive. God had made him to uſe his Knowledge, and to govern his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:003887_0043_10020CD765857FD0"/>in a reverential Obedience to Him his LORD. To diſobey was neceſſarily to defile him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf both as to Soul and Body, and that <hi>preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tnouſly</hi> in Defiance to the Warning given him of the fatal Effect on both, Death bodily and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual. Here was a Complication of Infidelity, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, Diſcontent, Prophaneſs, Senſuality, Pride and Arrogance, with unnatural Cruelty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his own Life, and that of his Offspring.</p>
            <p>This Account of the <hi>Original</hi> of Sin and Miſery wonderfully agrees with the Progreſs and <hi>Propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it from Age to Age. As one excellently obſerves and argues, <q>We ſee it ſtill in our Selves to be the Eſtabliſhment of God, in the Nature and Conſtitution of Things, that all irregular Indulgence of bodily Appetite, of one Kind or other, is atttended with Evil: And ſo alſo every inordinate Affection and Paſſion of Soul, and in particular all vain Purſuits of ſuperiour Wiſdom, Affectation and Pride of Knowledge, naturally tend to impair the Powers of the Mind and make it vain. And as this is matter of Fact, ſo what can be more worthy of the Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Perfection of God's Government, than that the Abuſe of Reaſon ſhould impair the Powers of it, and Indulgence of Appetite make it more irregular.</q> And if every Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Mind and Fleſh in Man is ſtill attended with Evil, how agreable to Reaſon muſt this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>the Original of Evil</hi> be, which <hi>Moſes</hi> gives us; ſoil, That God acquainted <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> as ſoon as he had made 'em, with <hi>this</hi> certain and invariable Conſtitution of Humane Nature; and therefore vehemently prohibited every inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Deſire and Appetite, becauſe of the <hi>Evil</hi> that would onſue upon it, to Themſelves firſt and alſo to their Poſterity after them; which in the Courſe
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:003887_0044_10020C78E1C68F88"/>of Nature is unavoidable, <q>The Infections of Parents affecting their <hi>Children</hi> while yet in their <hi>Loins.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And this again was a very great <hi>Aggravation</hi> of the firſt Tranſgreſſion, that it muſt be in the Courſe of Nature the Inlet and <hi>Entail</hi> of Sin and Miſery upon the Offspring. If the firſt Parents corrupted themſelves, their Iſſue muſt come depraved into the World both in Soul and Body: <hi>For who can bring a clean Thing out of an unclean? That which is born of the Fleſh is Fleſh.</hi> People that are vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and luſtful corrupt their own Seed, more or leſs by their Indulgences, and often entail Diſeaſes, Dolours and evil Inclinations upon their Offspring; which is one Way of God's <hi>viſiting the Iniquity of Parents on their Children to the third and fourth Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</hi> — And that the firſt Corruption of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind ſhould be by their firſt Parents eating of a Fruit forbidden to them, becauſe Evil for them to eat of, by a good God, can't ſeem at all ſtrange to us who know that there are ſeveral ſorts of Fruits growing at this Day about us, the eating whereof would poiſon our Bodies and be deadly to us, ſome preſently, ſome more leiſurely. And thoſe that do in the moſt ſlow manner affect the bodily Life, do at the ſame Periods of Time and in the ſame Degrees affect the Soul and hurt the Powers of the Mind. The <hi>Experiment</hi> and Knowledge of Evil comes on Mankind after this Manner unto this Day. No wonder then if it firſt came in at this Door. Nay it may be we ſhould find, if we could but attain a <hi>perfect</hi> Knowledge of the Effects of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very forbidden Indulgence of bodily Appetite, and the Paſſions of our Souls, that there is not the <hi>leaſt</hi> of either Kind we can be guilty of, but it does in ſome Degree impair the Health and Life of the Body, as well as the Virtue and Purity of the Soul. Our Soul and Body in their preſent
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:003887_0045_10020CD945790040"/>Union ſuffer together, by every Intemperance and Luſting of Fleſh or Spirit, bring on their own Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and treaſure up Evil againſt the World to come; where God has told us we muſt ſuffer in both, if Sin is died in; if it is not repented of, ſubdued and forſaken here in the Body: Which is the only way to recover ſomething of a <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſaic</hi> State for Souls here, and of Life everlaſting for Soul and Body hereafter.</p>
            <p>Let the Wit of Man ſhow if it can a more <hi>eredible,</hi> a like <hi>natural</hi> Account of the <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Propagation</hi> of Sin and Miſery. And if the <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkers,</hi> the <hi>Deiſts</hi> and <hi>Unbelievers</hi> of the preſent Age cannot give us a more likely Account; more worthy of a wiſe and good God, and more agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Nature of Man; let them receive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and confeſs that GOD was in <hi>Moſes</hi> of a Truth, or at leaſt let them ceaſe their Cavilling and Snarling at the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> and from blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Writings of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my own part, If I know what <hi>free thinking</hi> is in this our degenerate State, wherein we find the Powers of Mind and Body infeebled and depraved to a great Degree; If I know what it is to reaſon clearly and impartially, it is on the Side of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and by Faith given to what he has written as a Revelation from God unto us. But it is no great wonder to ſee the <hi>Men of Licence</hi> and vicious Life at Defiance to the Writings of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which would convince them of Sin and lead 'em to the <hi>Original</hi> of it, and thereby condemn to Death all their lov'd criminal Indulgences both of Fleſh and Spirit. For if they own <hi>Moſes</hi> his Account to be true, <hi>Death</hi> muſt be for ever ſtaring 'em in the Face in all the Exceſſes of their bodily Appetites, in all their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Paſſions, and more eſpecially in their dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling imperious <hi>Aſſuming of Knowledge</hi> to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:003887_0046_10020C7DE65EE428"/>as if none had taſted of that <hi>Tree</hi> beſide 'em, but they were <hi>the Gods knowing Good &amp; Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it is too true that this is their Guilt and Aſpiration, in Similitude of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Tranſgreſſion, while they ridicule the Imputation of it and the Derivation of it. So has the <hi>Serpent beguiled 'em thro' his Subtlety,</hi> and like their firſt Parents they tranſgreſs daily, but do not <hi>ſee themſelves naked.</hi> While they laugh at the Account of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, and banter <hi>Moſes</hi> for it, they are but <hi>feeding on the Tree of Death without Fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay again, The <hi>Origine</hi> of Evil had remain'd <hi>unknown</hi> to us to this Day, if God had not <hi>reveal'd</hi> it to us in his Word. <hi>The World by Wiſdom</hi> could not know it. Neither the <hi>Grecian</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Schools could imagine which way Mankind had become ſo vicious, fooliſh and miſerable. The moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Solution of the Matter was the Opinion of a <hi>pre-exiſtent State</hi> wherein Souls had ſinned, and were ſent into theſe Bodies as into <hi>Priſons</hi> in Way of Puniſhment. Others went into the before na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med ridiculous Notion of <hi>two oppoſite and contrary Principles or Cauſes,</hi> the One of all the <hi>Good</hi> in the World, the other of all the <hi>Evil</hi> in it. What Confuſion was there in this Imagination of an <hi>Evil God?</hi> how <hi>were their fooliſh Hearts darkned?</hi> What a Mercy is it to be delivered out of this Maze and Labyrinth of Evil! Truth is eaſie, but Error is endleſs. How <hi>plain</hi> is the Matter now <hi>Moſes</hi> has told it to us? in the <hi>Queſt</hi> whereof we ſhould have wandered in vain without his <hi>Clue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Evil</hi> is from the Creature and not from God. Far be it from the ALMIGHTY <hi>who cannot be tempted with Evil, neither tempteth he any Man.</hi> Angels and Men were <hi>drawn away of their own Luſt and enticed.</hi> God inclined both the One and Other ſtrongly to Good, commanded it, and forbad the
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:003887_0047_10020CDB67857268"/>Knowledge of Evil. <hi>Angels</hi> were high in the Creation of God, but aſpiring to be higher they fell by <hi>Pride.</hi> Fallen they ſwell'd with Rage and Envy and Hatred of God, and of every happy Being, the Objects of his Love and Favour. <hi>Man</hi> being of this bleſſed Number, the Prince of Devils had him in his ſpiteful Eye, and preſently deviſed Means how to ſpoil <hi>God</hi> of his Glory from Man, and <hi>Man</hi> of his Bleſſedneſs in the Favour of God. He knew there was but <hi>one Way</hi> in which to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs this dire Event, and that was to entice Man into <hi>Sin, the abominable Thing which God hates.</hi> To compaſs this he conſidered the Nature of Man both as to Soul and Body, the Appetite of the one to <hi>Food,</hi> and the Thirſt of the other after <hi>Knowledge:</hi> And there being in the Garden one Tree of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fruit to look on forbidden to the Man, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed if he could by any Means to bring him to <hi>luſt</hi> after it and eat of it, and he fix'd on that by which he and his Angels had fallen; ſcil, <hi>Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> in his State, and by aſpiring after more <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;</hi> a Temptation to <hi>which</hi> he would draw from the very <hi>Name</hi> of the forbidden Tree, <hi>the Tree of Knowledge;</hi> a Tree (he would feign) to be deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for an <hi>Increaſe</hi> of Knowledge and Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Way,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us, Man was ſeduced, thro' the Subtlety of <hi>Satan,</hi> the <hi>Prince of Devils,</hi> to diſobey God, and bring Ruine on Himſelf and on his Poſterity, both as to Soul and Body. And what can be more probable than <hi>ſuch</hi> a Way and Inlet to all the <hi>Evil</hi> we find our Selves ſubject to here in this Life, and to <hi>Death</hi> the End of it? What but <hi>Diſobedience</hi> to God our Maker, and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion</hi> againſt his <hi>Will</hi> made known to us for our Good? even for our Preſervation in Holineſs and Happineſs. What can be more honorary and <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to God</hi> than this Account of the Original of Evil? and what more <hi>like our Selves,</hi> our own
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:003887_0048_10020CDDA0482130"/>Conſciences being Witneſſes? For to be ſure we find our Selves fallen into Sin, and moſt prone to it by Nature from our Birth; and what more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Account can there be of our coming into ſuch a State, than by the Inſtigation of ſome <hi>Devil</hi> or other, in ſuch an Inſtance as <hi>Moſes</hi> has related? Nor can we wonder at the <hi>Conſequence</hi> of ſo much Evil, bodily and ſpiritual; upon the Suppoſition of ſuch <hi>Sin</hi> and Tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore ſeriouſly peruſe and weigh the whole <hi>Proceſs</hi> of the Temptation and Seduction of our firſt Parents, as it is given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and ſee if it be not the moſt likely, and only probable Account of the <hi>Origine</hi> of Evil that has been offered.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Evil</hi> could not come from the <hi>Good</hi> GOD, as His Act, Will or Pleaſure, is moſt certain: The Nature of God muſt abhor from it, and ſo does <hi>Moſes</hi> his Account.— That <hi>Evil</hi> is of two Sorts is evident, <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>penal;</hi> the Evil of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment</hi> for Sin: <hi>Moſes</hi> reveals it, and we are conſcious to it within our Selves; we have <hi>Senſe</hi> of Sorrow and Pain, and we have the <hi>Conſcience</hi> of Sin.— That bodily and Soul <hi>Sorrows</hi> or Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and that Diſſolution of Soul and Body which they work, ſhould be the <hi>Fruit</hi> of our Sinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, is the moſt eaſy, natural and only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and worthy Account of the Matter, that the Wit of Man can give.— That <hi>Evils</hi> beſet us from the Womb, and purſue us thro' all our Life here in the Fleſh, wear out our Bodies and Spirits, and bring down our green or gray Heads to the Grave, is a thing not to be denied. — That <hi>theſe</hi> are under the Providence and <hi>Government</hi> of a moſt wiſe, good and holy GOD, is as certain as the very Being of One.—That they muſt come upon us for Correction and Judgment, and in a Way of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:003887_0049_10020C83CEDF5F80"/>is ſenſible to Fleſh and Blood, and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to Reaſon: We groan, weep, cry out and beg for Mercy, Compaſſion and Reſpite, under our bodily Maladies &amp; Preſſures. — What GOD ſhould puniſh us for, but for <hi>Sin</hi> againſt Him, ſome cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Diſorder of our Appetites and Affections, in Contradiction to the Law of our Nature, his Will made known to us for our Good and his Glory from us, is not to be imagined. — That this Sin is <hi>of our Selves,</hi> or by the Inſtigation of <hi>ſome evil Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> who had himſelf fallen from God, is as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to our Underſtandings as that God is good, and can be the Author only of what is good, pure and perfect.— That this good God ſhould do all that is fit and proper to <hi>prevent</hi> his happy Creature from falling into Evil, is every way agreable to our Reaſon, as <hi>Moſes</hi> has told us that he did. — That He ſhould hainouſly <hi>reſent</hi> his Creatures pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous Sinning, is moſt agreable to all our Ideas of his Wiſdom, Holineſs, Dominion and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.— That He is very <hi>juſt</hi> and righteous in the Infliction of Evil upon the Sinner, is as undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as his neceſſary Relation to us of a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver and a Judge. — The only Doubt or <hi>Queſtion</hi> then is, Whether <hi>Moſes his Account of Adam's Sin,</hi> by a criminal Indulgence of his Appetite, in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular forbidden Inſtance, at the Sollicitation of a fallen Angel, that was before become an Enemy to GOD and Goodneſs; be not a very rational Account of the Introduction of Evil, into this Part of the Creation of God which we inhabit? — If the <hi>Infidels,</hi> who are ready to ridicule <hi>Moſes</hi> his Account, can give a better, let them do it: But this they do not attempt.— Yet they ſay that the Account of <hi>Moſes</hi> is incredible, becauſe of the Agency of the <hi>Serpent,</hi> his Part in ſeducing <hi>Eve,</hi> and God's Curſe upon <hi>him</hi> for it.—But let us deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berately read over, and examine, what <hi>Moſes</hi> has
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:003887_0050_10020CB2C84A6BD8"/>written of this Matter, in the <hi>third Chapter of Geneſis;</hi> and if we cannot vindicate it as worthy of the bleſſed GOD, and the moſt likely Way of <hi>Man's</hi> firſt Sin and the Evil conſequent thereon, then let 'em mock on.— Or I would rather ſay, Altho' we cannot anſwer for every Difficulty in the Account given of Man's Fall, yet we may ſee Eno' in it of GOD, his Wiſdom, Goodneſs, Holineſs and Juſtice, <hi>to ſtill the Enemy and the Avenger,</hi> and to fill us with Admiration of and Thankfulneſs for the Writings of <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Matter then lies thus,

                  <item>2. The <hi>Nature</hi> of this Tree was ſuch, or the <hi>Conſtitution of God</hi> reſpecting it was ſuch, that if Man eat of it 'twould bring <hi>Evil</hi> on him.</item>
                  <item>3. God immediately <hi>inform'd</hi> our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents hereof, and poſitively <hi>forbad</hi> 'em to eat of it, becauſe of the <hi>Evil</hi> it would bring upon them if they dar'd to touch it.</item>
                  <item>4. He therefore call'd it in their Hearing by the <hi>Name</hi> of the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Good and Evil; which was to ſay, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they would <hi>experience</hi> within themſelves what <hi>Evil</hi> is, and how it differs from the <hi>Good</hi> which they were in the full Enjoyment of.</item>
                  <item>5. He let them know therefore, that this Tree was placed there for the <hi>Trial of their Obedience;</hi> whether in the midſt of all the other Fruits of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> of all which they might freely and ſafely eat, they would regard his Will and Pleaſure in this <hi>one</hi> Prohibition, which was alſo for their Preſervation.</item>
                  <item>6. He therefore alſo ſet <hi>a Tree of Life</hi> in the Midſt of the Garden, as a Sacramental Sign or natural Means of <hi>Immortality,</hi> for him to eat of; while the Tree forbidden to him would only bring certain <hi>Death</hi> on him. — Upon all we muſt remember the <hi>Perfection of Underſtanding</hi> wherein our firſt Parents
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:003887_0051_10020CDFD9582CA8"/>were created; that they perfectly underſtood the Mind and Will of God in all this Prohibition, with the Reaſon and Equity of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint in this Particular, which plainly appears from <hi>Eve's</hi> Anſwer to the Serpent, Gen. iii. 2, 3, <hi>And the Woman ſaid to the Serpent, We may cat of the Fruit of the Trees of the Garden; but of that Tree which is in the Midſt of the Garden God hath ſaid, "Ye ſhall not eat of it, neither ſhall ye touch it leſt ye die.</hi>

<list>
                  <item>1. Let us ſuppoſe with <hi>Moſes</hi> a World of accurſed <hi>fallen Spirits,</hi> with <hi>Satan</hi> at their Head, who in their Pride and Rebellion againſt God had left their firſt Seat, and were full of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> to God, <hi>full of all ſubtlety and Miſchief, Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of all Righteouſneſs,</hi> as contrary to God and all Goodneſs as <hi>Darkneſs</hi> is to Light.</item>
                  <item>2. We may reaſonably grant that theſe wicked diabolical Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, in their Spite againſt God, and Enmity to his Image in Man, and Envy of his Delight in him, would <hi>deſire to ſeduce Mankind</hi> into Sin and Miſery after themſelves.</item>
                  <item>3. There is nothing in Reaſon and Juſtice to forbid God's <hi>permitting the Tempter</hi> to <hi>try</hi> the Obedience of his happy Creature, endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Knowledge, Holineſs and Strength for yielding him a conſtant and reſolute Obedience.</item>
                  <item>4. It is not unlikely, that God having placed <hi>a Tree</hi> in the Garden which he had forbidden Man to touch, the Tempter would fix on that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Teſt,</hi> and try if he could not prevail over our Parents in this matter of <hi>bodily Appetite.</hi>
                  </item>

And

                  <item>1. Remembring well how he fell himſelf by <hi>Pride,</hi> aſpiring after a <hi>higher</hi> State in the Creation than that God had given him, he naturally tho't <hi>this</hi> as likely a Way whereby to prevail over Man, a

                  <item>2. If therefore he can prevail on <hi>Adam</hi> or <hi>Eve</hi> to luſt after <hi>greater Knowledge</hi> and Wiſdom, he knew that they would fall after him, into his own Condemnation.</item>
                  <item>3.

                  <item>4.

            <p>This ſeems evidently to be the <hi>Scheme</hi> which the <hi>Devil</hi> laid, according to <hi>Moſes</hi> Account; and a more <hi>ſubtle</hi> one could not be laid: It was <hi>a Depth of Satan.</hi> In Purſuance of it,
<list>
                  <item>1.

                  <item>2. He watch'd his Opportunity to find <hi>Eve alone,</hi> near to the forbidden Tree, to ſpeak to her as out of the Mouth of the Serpent.</item>

3. We may will ſuppoſe <hi>ſhe</hi> was exceedingly <hi>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed</hi> to hear a brute and dumb Creature ſpeak with humane Voice and Underſtanding, and that ſhe might be ready to <hi>expreſs</hi> her Surpriſe thereat. And</item>
                  <item>4. We may as reaſonably ſuppoſe that the <hi>Devil</hi> in the Serpent's Form, like <hi>himſelf,</hi> a falſe and <hi>lying Spirit,</hi> told her that he came by his <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and Underſtanding, and by the Power of <hi>Speech,</hi> by hapning to <hi>eat</hi> of the excellent Fruit of <hi>that Tree:</hi> That whereas till now he had been indeed a <hi>brute</hi> Creature and deſtitute of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, immediately his Eyes were open, and a <hi>Man's</hi> Heart was given him, and this Light and Underſtanding came into him, which ſhe now ſaw and heard.</item>
                  <item>5. We may well imagine that the pretended <hi>Serpent</hi> told her this with a great Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Joy and <hi>Tranſport,</hi> as one muſt needs have that was at once <hi>transform'd</hi> from the Spirit of a Beaſt to that of a humane Intelligence.</item>
                  <item>6. We may as well think that hereupon <hi>Eve</hi> ſpake her Admiration of this <hi>Event,</hi> and let the Serpent know how that God had <hi>forbidden</hi> them to taſte of this Tree; which ſhe could not but the more muſe upon and <hi>wonder</hi> at, upon what ſhe now ſaw and heard.</item>
                  <item>7. To which the <hi>Serpent</hi> alſo anſwers with a Shew of Wonder, and asks (as <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us) <hi>"Yea, hath God ſaid, ye ſhall not eat of every Tree in the Garden?</hi> q. d. <hi>Can</hi> it be ſo? and <hi>what</hi> can this mean? can the good God lay any ſuch <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint</hi> upon you? and forbid you <hi>this</hi> Tree in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular?</item>
                  <item>8. <hi>Eve</hi> naturally, and truly replied, Yes, <hi>We may eat of the Fruit of the Trees of the Garden, but of this Tree God hath ſaid, "Ye ſhall not eat of it; neither ſhall ye touch it, leſt ye die.</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>It is plain there had been ſome <hi>previous Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> between the <hi>Serpent</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> before the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent's Words, <hi>"Yea, hath God ſaid, ye ſhall not eat?</hi> It ſeems to be a Return to ſomewhat ſaid
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:003887_0054_10020CE41AD55E98"/>before. The Temptation had been elſe too <hi>abrupt,</hi> and the Devil had betray'd himſelf to be endued with <hi>more</hi> than humane Knowledge; even to know what God had ſaid to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> while he was yet a <hi>Brute</hi> and without Underſtanding.— Or if you would chuſe to think, that the Serpent would have <hi>Eve</hi> imagine, that he had indeed attain'd to the Intelligence of <hi>Angels</hi> by eating of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Fruit, it will but carry the Deception yet <hi>higher,</hi> and make the Temptation ſo much the ſtronger.—But it is more likely that he appear'd to take this Information from her own <hi>Lips,</hi> and leads her into Wonder and <hi>Inquiſitiveneſs</hi> after the <hi>Reaſon</hi> of ſuch a Prohibition to them; while ſhe ſaw (as was pretended) the happy wondrous <hi>Effect</hi> that the Fruit had on him, the <hi>Serpent,</hi> that was before an ignorant and <hi>dumb</hi> Beaſt.—And when the <hi>Devil</hi> had by this <hi>Wile</hi> ſhook her Mind, rais'd in her a <hi>Suſpenſe</hi> and doubtful Admiration, and too much a Regard to her Senſes, in a Contradiction to the Word of God; then the <hi>Tempter</hi> boldly ſhot his <hi>fiery Dart,</hi> and as a Creature of ſuperior Light ſaid to the <hi>Woman, "Ye ſhall not ſurely die: For God doth know that in the Day you eat your Eyes ſhall be opened, and ye ſhall be as God's, knowing Good and Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This bold <hi>Satanical</hi> Reaſoning had its curſed Effect upon the Mind and Heart of <hi>Eve!</hi> She took in the Poiſon of <hi>Pride,</hi> and the <hi>Luſt</hi> after more Knowledge conceived within her, and ſhe <hi>fell</hi> after the Example of <hi>Satan.</hi> She look'd upon the Fruit with Deſire, believing all that the <hi>Serpent</hi> had ſaid of it. It <hi>look'd</hi> good for food; nay the Serpent had <hi>found</hi> it ſo: It was pleaſant to her <hi>Eye,</hi> but more to her aſpiring <hi>Mind:</hi> She conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it as deſirable to make her <hi>wiſe,</hi> wiſe as the <hi>Angels</hi> of God who know <hi>good and evil:</hi> She gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily took therefore of the Fruit and eat, <hi>and gave
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:003887_0055_10020C88E6A5C0C8"/>alſo to her Husband with her, and he did eat.</hi> That is to ſay, She went away to <hi>Adam,</hi> with ſome of the Fruit in her Hand, and told him of all that ſhe had <hi>ſeen</hi> and <hi>heard</hi> of the Serpent's <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>ſpeaking,</hi> with Underſtanding equal if not ſuperior to their own; and that he had told her to what <hi>Angelical and Godlike Heights of Knowledge</hi> the Fruit will raiſe <hi>them</hi> upon their eating of it: To all which <hi>Adam</hi> hearkened, and from a <hi>like Luſt after for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Knowledge,</hi> he ſuddenly, raſhly and fatally took from his Wifes Hand and eat.</p>
            <p>It ſeems to me, that our Firſt Parents not tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Time to <hi>deliberate</hi> on the Matter, did not ſee into the real <hi>Deviliſm</hi> of the Serpent's Words; that it was a giving God the <hi>Lye,</hi> |and to <hi>tax</hi> him with want of Goodneſs and Bounty to his Creatures, or with grudging to 'em and denying them the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that was proper for 'em. Or if we may think that the ſagacious Minds of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> could not fail of theſe Reflections upon the Devil's Words, then was their <hi>Crime</hi> and Guilt ſo much the more like unto the very <hi>Devils</hi> who deceived them.</p>
            <p>And now I may appeal unto the Heart of every impartial <hi>Reader,</hi> if <hi>Moſes</hi> has not given us the moſt <hi>likely</hi> Account we can imagine, of the <hi>Seduction</hi> and Fall of our firſt Parents? <hi>How the Serpent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled Eve thro' his Subtlety! how by one Man Sin has enter'd into the World, and Death by Sin, and has paſſed upon all! how by one Man's Diſobedience all are made Sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I go on now to the <hi>Conſequents</hi> upon the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> as they are related by <hi>Moſes:</hi> And for my own part I cannot but think the <hi>Account</hi> given by him to be ſo <hi>rational</hi> and natural, that I cannot imagine how it <hi>could</hi> be otherwiſe. That is to ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:003887_0056_10020CE6FA446D78"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That as ſoon as our <hi>Firſt Parents</hi> had ſinned <hi>they ſaw themſelves naked:</hi> i. e. found themſelves under ſome ſhameful <hi>Diſorder</hi> both of Mind and Body: A Cloud came upon their Minds, Guilt ſtung 'em, Fear ſeiz'd 'em, and they ſaw each other's Face chang'd for the worſe: The Joys of Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence left their Eyes, the Poiſon of the Fruit work'd in their Veins, ſick Qualms and cold Sweats came upon them, and their Minds were full of Confuſion and Conſternation at their Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: They felt the forbidden <hi>Knowledge of Evil,</hi> and were ready to run and hide themſelves any where.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is moſt reaſonable to think that <hi>God would now appear, arraign and condemn them to die,</hi> according to his <hi>Threatning</hi> in Caſe they diſobey'd Him. Whereupon it is natural to think <hi>the Sinners would fly from his Preſence,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays they did, as ſoon as they <hi>heard his Voice.</hi>—It is alſo altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther worthy of GOD to <hi>call them forth</hi> with the Voice of an offended Father and Judge, <hi>Adam, where art thou?</hi> — The Anſwer of <hi>Adam</hi> muſt needs be juſt as <hi>Moſes</hi> relates it; ſcil, a plain <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> of his Crime; for there was no hiding it. <hi>"And he ſaid, I heard thy Voice in the Garden and was afraid, becauſe I was naked, and I hid my ſelf.</hi> Shame naturally hides it ſelf, and Fear flies.— This was Confeſſion eno' of the Fact to <hi>God,</hi> and therefore the <hi>Reply</hi> is juſt which <hi>Moſes</hi> gives us from the Mouth of God, "Who <hi>told thee that thou waſt naked? haſt thou eaten of the Tree whereof I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee, that thou ſhouldſt not eat?</hi> q. d. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Loſs of thy Innocence, and Guilt of Sin, could ſtrike thee with this Fear, and cover thee with this Shame: Where is the Love and Joy with which you were won't to welcome my Preſence? — And now what could <hi>Adam</hi> ſay for himſelf, but thoſe words which <hi>Moſes</hi> relates, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:003887_0057_10020C8C2E4A3070"/>the Blame on his <hi>Wife,</hi> who was <hi>firſt</hi> in the Tranſgreſſion? And what ſhould <hi>Eve</hi> anſwer, but as <hi>Moſes</hi> has it, <hi>"The Serpent beguiled me.</hi> — And upon this their Confeſſion what ſhould follow, but God's paſſing <hi>Sentence</hi> and <hi>Judgment?</hi> — And <hi>where</hi> ſhould the Judgment <hi>begin,</hi> but on the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent?</hi> i. e. <hi>Satan</hi> the Contriver and Author of all this Sin and Miſchief.— And firſt the <hi>Curſe</hi> falls upon the <hi>Inſtrument</hi> which the Devil us'd, <hi>the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;</hi> and our Parents ſaw the Creature <hi>chang'd</hi> from that beauteous Form wherein it was before, <hi>into a crawling hiſſing Snake,</hi> viler than every Beaſt about them, to ſlide upon his Belly in the Duſt, and feed upon it. No doubt, this Change upon the Serpent ſtruck <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> with new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe and Terror; as a Criminal that is to die for <hi>Beaſtiality</hi> ſees with Horror the poor <hi>Beaſt</hi> ſlain before his Eyes, as the dire <hi>Prologue</hi> to his own Execution. — Then under the Shadow of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity that ſhould for ever be between the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Eve</hi> and every Kind of <hi>Serpents,</hi> which we all know to be univerſal and invincible; (<hi>Theſe</hi> being ever ready at the <hi>Heels</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> to <hi>bite</hi> 'em, and <hi>They</hi> being ever as ready to <hi>bruiſe</hi> the <hi>Heads</hi> of Serpents and deſtroy them) I ſay, under the Image of <hi>this,</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> is told of and threatned with <hi>a glorious</hi> SEED <hi>of this poor miſerable Woman</hi> that ſhould <hi>break his Head,</hi> while he ſhould be only able <hi>to bruiſe his Heel.</hi> — This was a <hi>deadly</hi> Word to the <hi>Old Serpent, the Devil and Satan;</hi> and no doubt the <hi>Fiend</hi> was ſtruck with <hi>Torments</hi> by it, which no Humane Soul can think of. And fit it was the <hi>Judgment</hi> ſhould begin with <hi>him</hi> who was the guilty <hi>Cauſe</hi> and Beginning of all this <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy.</hi>— At the ſame Time, It was a moſt <hi>merciful Revelation of a</hi> SAVIOUR, and of a <hi>Suffering</hi> RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER, to be born of <hi>Eve, born of a Woman</hi> without the Concurrence of <hi>a Son of Adam;</hi> who
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:003887_0058_10020CE89774C2C0"/>ſhould conquer <hi>Satan</hi> and <hi>deſtroy his Work</hi> and <hi>aboliſh Death,</hi> by recovering Souls from Sin &amp; Hell. All which has been fulfilled, we know, in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Temptations, Miniſtry, Miracles, Obedience, Sufferings, Death, Reſurrection, Aſcention and Reign of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, the <hi>Second A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;</hi> Who will come again in Glory <hi>to judge An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and caſt Death and Hell into the Lake of Fire and Brimſtone.</hi>—The <hi>Devil</hi> heard this his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and <hi>trembled,</hi> tho' he underſtood it not at the Time. Our <hi>Parents</hi> alſo heard it, and were enlightned to conceive of <hi>ſome moſt glorious Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer, a Son of Eve,</hi> in God's Time; and it was <hi>Life from the Dead</hi> to them; while it was <hi>Death and Damnation</hi> in the worſt <hi>Form</hi> that could be to the <hi>proud Serpent,</hi> to be overcome, deſtroyed, judged and damned by a <hi>mortal Son</hi> of that <hi>weak Woman,</hi> whom he had juſt deceiv'd into Sin and Ruin.— Say now, if this was not worthy of the Infinite Wiſdom and <hi>Foreknowledge</hi> of God, his Sovereignty and Dominion, his Juſtice Mercy and Grace! <hi>This is the</hi> LORD'S <hi>Doing and wonderful in our Eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Then GOD, the <hi>Judge,</hi> proceeded and told the <hi>Woman,</hi> that he would <hi>multiply her Sorrows</hi> in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Children, for alluring her <hi>Husband</hi> into Sin; and that henceforth <hi>She</hi> and her <hi>Daughters</hi> ſhould be in ſuch a ſuffering ſort of <hi>Subjection</hi> to the <hi>Mens</hi> diſordered Paſſions, as they would never at all have known, if She had not been an <hi>Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in his Sin and Fall. — The <hi>Man</hi> alſo was told that <hi>the Ground was curſed for his ſake,</hi> that <hi>in Sorrow he ſhould eat of it all the Days of his Life, till he return'd into it:</hi> Which Words were a plain and expreſs <hi>Reprieve</hi> granted to <hi>Adam and Eve</hi> from deſerved <hi>inſtant</hi> Death; but as plain and poſitive a Declaration of <hi>Death working in them,</hi> from that Day forward, and bringing them down
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:003887_0059_10020C8F6D0FF320"/>
               <hi>ſlowly</hi> to the Grave. — All Mankind have been from that Day a <hi>Comment</hi> on this righteous and terrible Judgment of God; having the full <hi>Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment</hi> of it in Themſelves. All ſadly know the <hi>Truth</hi> of it. It has been, is and will be to the End of the World, as <hi>Moſes</hi> has written. <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Sin</hi> is the Original, Cauſe and Means, of all the dolorous <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> of Body and <hi>Griefs</hi> of Mind, which bring on that Death, to which every Son and Daughter of <hi>Adam</hi> are inevitably doom'd by the righteous <hi>Sentence</hi> of God.</p>
            <p>And now ſay, Have we not Reaſon to think that <hi>Moſes</hi> has writ from the Mouth of <hi>God,</hi> in all this Account of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall and Puniſhment, and of <hi>Satan</hi>'s Agency therein and Judgment therefor? It agrees to all the preſent known State of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, our dying Condition, the Sorrows of our Life, our Proneſs and Temptations to Sin, our Luſts and Corruptions, and our fearful Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Eternal Judgment of God, a <hi>Hell of Devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Things might be eaſily <hi>enlarg'd</hi> on, but the bare ſimple Mention of them carries, I think, a Light and Conviction to every ſober conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mind. A more reaſonable Account of the <hi>Origine of Sin on Earth,</hi> and of the <hi>Sorrows and Death</hi> the Demerit thereof, and of a <hi>final Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> therefrom <hi>by the Man</hi> CHRIST JESUS, cannot enter into the Heart of Man to conceive of. A better <hi>Foundation for Chriſtianity</hi> could not have been contrived by <hi>Moſes,</hi> had he liv'd and wrote after the Manifeſtation of CHRIST in the Fleſh, and after his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> from the Dead.</p>
            <p>But alas! the <hi>Sons of Eve</hi> are born with the Seed and Poiſon of <hi>Infidelity</hi> in their Veins! that
