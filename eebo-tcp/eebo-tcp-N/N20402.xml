            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>PREFACE.</head>
               <p>THE ſubſequent pages are the reſult of obſervations made, during the period of three months, on a diſeaſe hitherto but little known in this part of the continent; and, although they have not a number of years' experience to ſanction their accuracy, yet there are but few tropical practitioners, who have reſided the greateſt part of their lives in countries where the diſeaſe generally occurs, that have ſeen ſuch a number of caſes as ſome of the medical gentlemen of this city who have enjoyed but an indifferent ſhare of health during the melancholy ſpace of three months.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:026747_0004_0FD18D29D61676F8"/>To acquire information, to alleviate the diſtreſſes of my fellow-citizens, and to procure the matter of this eſſay, I have ſpared no pains; nor have I ſhrunk from ſcenes truly dreadful, to make myſelf acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the leading features of this diſeaſe, and the different morbid phenomena after death, ſo as to be enabled to narrate every circumſtance of importance and to diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the different ſtages of the diſeaſe with as much preciſion as the nature of it would admit; likewiſe, to point out the various appearances that tend to mark the favourable or unfavourable event, which are certainly of great importance to be aſcertained both to the phyſician and patient.</p>
               <p>It is, however, much to be regretted, that thoſe circumſtances are ſo little noticed by the different authors who have had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:026747_0005_0FD1BDBB58658F48"/>
opportunities of obſerving ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, ſo replete with danger in every ſtage; for, all I have had occaſion to conſult, ſince the diſappearance of it here, ſeem to differ much both with reſpect to the hiſtory and method of cure. In the former, moſt of them are very deficient. In the latter, few, I believe, can boaſt, with propriety, of their great ſucceſs, however different their methods of treating the diſeaſe may have been. For, ſome of thoſe practitioners, who wrote at an early period, recommend profuſe bleeding; others are more moderate in the uſe of that evacution; and ſome writers ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe the diſuſe of it altogether; whilſt Dr Moſely, a more modern author, recommends it, in an extreme degree, in particular caſes— his words are "Uſque ad deliquium animi." Such are the opinions of the various authors on the ſubject of veneſection in this diſeaſe;
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:026747_0006_0FD1BDBCD1EA1328"/>
but want of leiſure and free acceſs to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious medical publications, on this ſubject, during the prevalence of the malignant fever in this city, deprived me of an opportunity of conſulting many books on the occaſion. This circumſtance prevented the influence of partiality or prejudice on my mind reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neceſſary treatment. I was, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, obliged to ſeek, through my own ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on the ſymptoms, and the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance after death, what appeared to me the moſt rational method of cure.</p>
               <p>I have added to this eſſay an account of ſome diſſectious made at the hoſpital at Buſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, during the prevalence of the diſeaſe, on ſuch patients as were affected with it to an extreme degree.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:026747_0007_0FD1BDBE5C0ACD70"/>Being more deſirous of ſubmitting a plain narration of facts than ambitious to make a large book, I have omitted the inſertion of ſome propoſitions which it was my intention to have offered to the public on the utility and manner of conducting quarantines, where the commerce of countries renders a purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perſons and commercial objects ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. I, therefore, hope this intereſting medical ſubject may be handled by ſome one of the profeſſion who may have had longer experience than I have had in countries where ſuch diſeaſes generally occur, and whoſe abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities are more adequate to the taſk than my own.</p>
               <p>I ſhall now proceed to give the cleareſt and moſt intelligible idea of the diſeaſe that my limited experience enables me to form. I ſhall merely ſtate facts, as they occurred,
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:026747_0008_0FD1BDC10F120070"/>
without any attempt at embelliſhment of ſtyle; for, the ſimplicity of truth requires no colouring—ſhe is, like Milton's Eve,— "when unadorn'd, adorn'd the moſt."</p>

               <p>THE malignant and contagious fever, which has ſo lately committed ſuch devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon the inhabitants of this city, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, from all the information that could be obtained from the different publications on diſeaſes incident to mankind between the tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics, to be one nearly reſembling, in its moſt leading features, the yellow-fever of the Weſt India Iſlands, and of the coaſt of Africa <note n="*" place="bottom">Doctor Williams obſerved the diſeaſe on the coaſt of Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. See his eſſay on the ſubject, page 11.</note>; of which places I believe it to be a native. For
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:026747_0010_0FD1BDC58B54A668"/>
we have no authentic and accurate deſcription of it that I am acquainted with in the writings of authors on the diſeaſes of the Eaſt Indies, or province of Canton in China, where the ſeaſons of the latter are ſimilar to thoſe of the tropics. Various have been the appellations given to the late contagious fever, according to the different nations among whom it has occurred, and to the moſt uniform and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſymptoms they had obſerved in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. As a yellow ſuffuſion ſometimes takes place in the eyes and ſkin, it has by ſome au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors been termed a yellow or putrid bilious fever: the latter from it's ſometimes having a ſeptic tendency. As neither of theſe ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are conſtantly obſerved in the courſe of the diſeaſe, there may be ſome impropriety in the terms, however univerſally they may have been adopted. By the French it is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed "la maladie de Siam," from their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the ſame diſeaſe to have appeared in the kingdom of Siam in the Eaſt Indies. It is, likewiſe, called by the French
"la fievre
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:026747_0011_0FD1BDC74ECCE120"/>
matelotte" becauſe ſea-faring people were ſuppoſed to be moſt ſubject to it. The Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards call it "vomito preto" or the black vomiting, from one of it's dangerous ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. Such has been the diverſity of name for this diſeaſe. And with reſpect to it's origin in this city, it has been a little ſimilar. Some have ſuppoſed it to be indigenous and the offspring of vegetable putrefaction. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that it was imported from the Weſt Indies. Of the latter opinion I am clearly, for that is the moſt probable, and is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the greateſt number of facts. When it appeared before in this country, which has been at ſix different periods, excluſive of that of the laſt year, it could, with facility, be traced to have been imported from the Weſt Indies. It viſited Charleſton in South Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina four times according to Doctor Lining, viz. in 1732, 1739, 1745, and 1748. It like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe appears from Dr Lind <note place="bottom">Lind on Infection, page 293.</note> that it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:026747_0012_0FD1BDC89F048188"/>
here in 1740, by a trunk of wearing apparel; and, from the notes of Dr Redman, preſident of the college of phyſicians, on whoſe integrity I can depend, we are inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it was brought here from the Havan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah in 1762, by a mariner who arrived ſick. From that time it has never been obſerved in this city until laſt year, when it firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on the third of Auguſt, in Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet, between Mulberry and Saſſafras Streets, at a boarding-houſe much frequented by ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, many of whom belonged to the Xebec privateer, Sans Culottes, of Nantz, that had juſt come off from a cruiſe with the ſhip Flora her prize; the crew of which veſſel, from every circumſtance that could be collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, appears to have brought the diſeaſe indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly from the Weſt Indies into this city by exchanging part of her crew for that of a prize ſhe had taken from the Weſt India Iſlands, where the diſeaſe was well known to rage with great mortality.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="5" facs="unknown:026747_0013_0FD1BDCA049C1D60"/>The people moſt generally affected with this diſeaſe were the inhabitants of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, and natives of America from different parts of the Continent. No condition, or ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation in life was exempted from it's vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. The timid of both ſexes, the moſt healthy, and thoſe who ſeemed to have all the vigor of youth on their ſide, fell victims to it. No age ſcarcely eſcaped; from the child in the cradle up to confirmed manhood, and even from that to extreme old age. Women, during geſtation, appeared to me to be more ſuſceptible of it than thoſe who were not in that ſtate; and, in almoſt all, it produced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bortion or miſcarriage—few, I believe, reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from it; owing, probably, to their ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems being more diſpoſed to violent inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation than thoſe of others. It was, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, more fatal to the male than the female ſex. But the moſt chearful, fearleſs, and gay, of both ſexes, frequently eſcaped it, as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe did ideots, and thoſe people who, for a conſiderable length of time, had been a little deranged.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:026747_0014_0FD1BDD0840FE2F0"/>Strangers were very ſeldom attacked, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly thoſe from the Weſt India Iſlands where it generally affects foreigners. But here they were ſeldom ſuſceptible of it. Blacks of every deſcription, were leſs liable to it than the white inhabitants; and the negroes originally from the coaſt of Africa were ſcarcely ever affected <note n="*" place="bottom">Jackſon of Jamaica obſerves, that be never ſaw a Negro or a Creole with the diſeaſe who had lived conſtantly in their native country. See his book on fevers, page 250.</note>, although ſome of thoſe of our own country fell a ſacrifice to it's violence.</p>
               <p>During the firſt two weeks of it's appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in this city, it was almoſt entirely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to that part of Water-ſtreet where it commenced; and the inhabitants of that neighbourhood were ſeized in ſucceſſion. For the firſt ten days there were ſeldom two attacked with the diſeaſe in the ſame houſe, which induced ſome to think that it was not contagious; but they were ſoon ſorrowfully
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:026747_0015_0FD1BDD1880763B0"/>
miſtaken, for, it became general among the families of that neighbourhood, and not long after ſpread it's mortal influence to different parts of the city, carrying off a great part and even the whole of ſome families, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſuch deſtruction, that, in the ſpace of three months, upwards of four thouſand and forty eight perſons were conſigned to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. <note n="*" place="bottom">See Carey's account of the riſe and progreſs of the diſeaſe.</note>
               </p>
               <p>It was a ſingular fact, that when carried into the country, it never was, but in one inſtance, that I am acquainted with, propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated beyond the perſon who carried it; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſome of the family officiated as nurſes, and even ſlept in the ſame bed with the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient until the day of his death. This was the caſe, in ſome meaſure, during the ſeveral times it prevailed in Charleſton, South Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina; and, like many other contagious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, it does not appear ever to affect the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:026747_0016_0FD1BDD350B33CF0"/>

Although careful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry has been made by ſeveral of my medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal friends and myſelf, it only appears that ſome of the patients had a ſlight relapſe of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, but without any of the diſtinguiſhing ſymptoms of the diſeaſe, and very ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. This I have frequently obſerved in my own practice, and, likewiſe, in that of my friends—but I have never remarked a ſecond attack of the diſeaſe, however con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly the patient may have been afterwards expoſed to the contagion<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>Having thus far briefly traced the riſe and progreſs of this diſeaſe, which was beyond a doubt, highly contagious; I come now to conſider, under what circumſtances the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was communicated;—How long it was, after apparently receiving the infection, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it produced its effects;—And in what manner it acted on the ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>Theſe queſtions apply to contagion in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and are involved in much obſcurity and doubt; and it is probable that they never will be ſatisfactorily ſolved.</p>
               <p>With regard to the firſt propoſition, it may be obſerved, that like other contagious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:026747_0018_0FD1BDD6DBDBBE90"/>
this ſeemed to be communicated in three diſtinct ways—
<list>
                     <item>Firſt—by immediate contact with the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's body.</item>
                     <item>Secondly—through the medium of the air which ſurrounded him within a limited diſtance. And,</item>
                     <item>Thirdly—by bodies of different kinds being expoſed to, and as it were, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the matter of contagion, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a power of retaining it in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſtate, and communicating it to animated bodies.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>I believe the diſeaſe was communicated in theſe ſeveral ways. As to the firſt, viz. that of coming in contact with the patient's body, this was the moſt certain way of receiving it. I am not clear what particular ſtage was the moſt dangerous; but from ſuch information as could be collected, during the prevalence of the diſeaſe, it appeared to be the advanced ſtages;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026747_0019_0FD1BDDA04E8BAA8"/>
although I knew a nurſe, who I am almoſt certain received the infection from a patient, during the operation of an emetic; for the matter thrown up by vomiting emitted a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly foetid ſmell, which affected her ſoon after ſhe had carried it out of the room. Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the next day ſhe was attacked with all the ſymptoms of the diſeaſe. From this inſtance, and ſeveral more I could adduce if it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, of thoſe who received the infection at a later period, during the inflammatory ſtage; is it not probable that all patients, under ſimilar circumſtances are capable of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating the diſeaſe, during the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond days? But it is infinitely more conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious in the latter ſtages than in the early period.</p>
               <p>The ſecond mode of receiving the infection, was from the matter of contagion ariſing from the morbid body impregnating the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere of the chamber, and being applied to ſuſceptible conſtitutions. This, I believe,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:026747_0020_0FD1BDDBA46FB2A0"/>
can only take place within a certain ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the perſon affected, for in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as it became diffuſed in the atmoſphere, it muſt loſe it's activity, and be ſo far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted as not to be able to produce the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. Therefore people in walking the ſtreets, are ſecure from being contaminated by the atmoſphere which ſurrounds them; for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a number of articles, charged as it were, with the matter of contagion, be expoſed in the open air; yet the effluvia iſſuing from them, would be ſo much diffuſed, corrected and modified, through that immenſe ſpace, as ſcarcely to be able to have any effect, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept within the contagious atmoſphere, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending but a ſmall diſtance from the articles themſelves. The danger of going abroad in the city, during the prevalence of a conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious diſeaſe, is from coming in contact with the clothes of thoſe who had recently left the chambers of the ſick.</p>
               <p>The third mode of receiving the infection, was from ſubſtances which had imbibed the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:026747_0021_0FD1BDDE510EE9B0"/>
matter of contagion, having the power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining and communicating it in an active ſtate, ſuch as woollens, furs, &amp;c. under par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular circumſtances, as when excited by heat and applied to the healthy ſyſtem, have a power of inducing the diſeaſe. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner it is probably conveyed into different countries, in a quieſcent ſtate; after which, being excited by heat or any other agent, it exerts its baneful infl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ce on people within the ſphere of it's action; from which it is ſoon communicated and ſpread far and wide. In this way the contagion of the ſmall-pox may be communicated—it may in like manner be retained from ſeaſon to ſeaſon, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculation. By the laſt mode of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, many of the inhabitants of this city re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the contagion of the yellow fever— from lying on beds upon which people had died, and ſome from even handling the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes of the diſeaſed before they had been aired. I am acquainted with a gentleman of this city, who, in all probability, received the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:026747_0022_0FD1BDE3999DA9B8"/>
infection, from lying on the ſacking bottom and bedſtead on which his wife had died.</p>
               <p>Our next propoſition is—In what length of time the diſeaſe commences after a perſon has been expoſed to and received the infection. This was variable and difficult to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined; for many expoſed themſelves ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly that it was not poſſible to aſcertain the exact time at which they received the contagion: although in ſome, from the moſt accurate information that could be obtained, it was from nine until fourteen days after they were ſuppoſed to have received the infection. Thoſe, whoſe apprehenſions were much aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by the dread of dying, ſeemed to have the diſeaſe ſooner completely formed, after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the contagion, than thoſe who did not la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under that anxious ſtate of mind. But all that can be ſaid on this ſubject is involved in great uncertainty. There ſeems however to be ſome analogy between this and other conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious diſeaſes in reſpect to the time of it's
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:026747_0023_0FD1BDE7F36541D0"/>
commencement after the infection is taken. For as the ſmall-pox, gonorrhea, &amp;c. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a certain length of time after expoſure to and reception of the infection, before the diſeaſe is formed—ſo does this. Some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions ſeem hardly ſuſceptible of thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, however much they may have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to their influence. But the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſuch people are not often found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the variety of mankind; yet during the prevalence of the late fever there were numerous inſtances of perſons who had not been expoſed to its influence before, that were not affected by it. Theſe inſtances are, however, particularly confined to the black in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, with but few exceptions of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent colour. There was not one inſtance of a French Weſt-Indian's having the diſeaſe, owing probably to having had it before; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thoſe from Europe were as ſuſceptible of it as the inhabitants of America.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the operation of the matter of contagion on the ſyſtem, after being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:026747_0024_0FD1BDEA871D1B20"/>
into the circulating fluids, and the ſtate in which it continues from the time of recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion until the appearance of the diſeaſe—are very difficult matters to determine, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, will ever remain involved in myſterious darkneſs. But as contagious diſeaſes, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, exhibit ſtrong marks of increaſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement and general phenomena of inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, requiring, almoſt always, a debilitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plan of cure; one would be inclined to think, with a late celebrated author, that it's operation was a ſtimulant one, and that the length of time requiſite to produce its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete effect, would be in proportion to the ſuſceptibility of the conſtitution, to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of contagion. This, of courſe, will be variable. There is another circumſtance of importance to be aſcertained; and with regard to which, it ſeems difficult to obtain any ſatisfactory information:—indeed, to decide properly on it, requires much more experience in contagious diſeaſes, than I am poſſeſſed of, and this is, <hi>How long convaleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:026747_0025_0FD1BDEBD42253D0"/>

                     </gap> ſhould be excluded from company; or in other words, have the power of communicating the diſeaſe?</hi>—Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of experience in contagious diſeaſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend people, who have been expoſed to infection, to perform a quarantine of thirty days, after which their perſons and baggage ſhould be fumigated. This practice appears tolerably well calculated for convaleſcents. But the ſafeſt mode is not to admit them into company, whilſt they have the leaſt ſymptom of the diſeaſe about them.</p>
               <p>It does not appear, from accurate obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made by moſt of the tropical writers and others, on the ſtate of the weather, that the different ſeaſons, or any particular ſtate of the weather, produce this diſeaſe; for it may be frequently met with, at every ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the year in the Weſt Indies.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Hilary's Obſervations, page 146.</note> The progreſs of the diſeaſe in this city, was

               <head>DESCRIPTION OF THE DISEASE.</head>
               <p>THIS diſeaſe moſt frequently attack-people in the courſe of the night or early in the morning with ſome degree of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral laſſitude, loſs of appetite, diſagreeable taſte in the mouth, ſudden proſtration of ſtrength, accompanied with univerſal pain and ſoreneſs over the body particularly about the large joints; theſe were ſoon after ſucceeded with ſome degree of chillneſs, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternate chills and fluſhes of heat, but very
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:026747_0030_0FD1BDF347F41A30"/>
ſeldom a complete rigor; during the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of this ſtate the face appeared pallid, the features contracted, the whole counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance exhibiting a dejected aſpect, with a correſponding ſtate of mind; after which was perceived a ſlight pain in the fore or back part of the head, and frequently ſome degree of vertigo, with a ſenſe of fatigue about the loins not unfrequently extending towards the iliae and pubes; together with an uneaſy ſenſation between the ſhoulders and back of the neck. Theſe ſymptoms hourly increaſed in violence, attended frequently with diſagreeable eructations, nauſea, frequent retching to vomit, particularly after taking large draughts of warm or cool drinks, or upon motion of the body.</p>
               <p>The eyes were generally highly ſuffuſed, exhibiting the appearance of a painted eye or one minutely injected, accompanied with a ſenſation as if irritated by ſand, and generally an averſion to light. This I have frequently obſerved to take place during the rigor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:026747_0031_0FD1BDFA94AE3850"/>
generally at a more advanced period of the diſeaſe, or ſometimes not at all during the whole courſe of it.—</p>
               <p>After the rigor the pulſe generally became frequent, tenſe, and tolerably even, at other times ſoft and irregular, the heat moſtly a little higher than the healthy ſtandard. The ſtate of the ſkin variable, ſometimes moiſt, but generally dry; reſpiration a little more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent than ordinary, attended with ſighing and oppreſſion at the praecordia, indicating great diſtreſs. Theſe were obſervable even from the acceſſion of the rigor. At other times not until a more advanced period.</p>
               <p>The tongue was generally moiſt and white, particularly in the middle and red or of a purpliſh hue towards the edges and tip. Bowels generally coſtive, but ſometimes a diarrhoea, urine of a higher color, than na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and ſmall in quantity.</p>
               <p>As the evening approached every ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom became aggravated, the pulſe more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:026747_0032_0FD1BDFE0E287B30"/>
full and ſtrong, heat conſiderably aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, pain in the head and back excrucia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, in the former ſhooting from temple to temple, in the latter to the hips and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding down the thighs, ſkin dry and parched, ſometimes a partial moiſture, particularly when the bed clothes were increaſed, but without any abatement of the febrile ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms.</p>
               <p>The ſickneſs and retching increaſed, with an ejection of frothy or bilious matter or whatever fluid was laſt received into the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, accompanied with pain and ſoreneſs in the epigaſtric region upon the leaſt preſſure, with a ſenſation of inceſſant burning, attended with reſtleſſneſs, ſo that no poſture afforded any relief. During the exacerbation the reſpiration became more frequent, with an increaſe of ſighing and ſlight pain and throbbing in one or other of the hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driac regions, with ſtrong beating in the moſt conſpicuous arterial trunks the face was very much fluſhed, the features conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:026747_0033_0FD1BDFF47C2FFE0"/>
diſtorted, with a ſlight haemorrhage from one or both noſtrils, and an increaſed ſuffuſion of the tunica adnata.</p>
               <p>The intellectual faculties at times appeared confuſed, but ſeldom a complete delirium. In the intervals of reaſon the patient was very deſponding, and under dreadful apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for the event, complained much of thirſt which was almoſt inſatiable, for no ſooner did any fluid reach the ſtomach than it was inſtantly rejected with violence. Every morning the ſymptoms ſuffered ſome abatement <note n="*" place="bottom">It may not be improper to obſerve that for ſeveral weeks after the contagious fever made its appearance in this city intermitting and remitting fevers were met with at a ſhort diſtance off from the place where the malignant fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was exerting its deſtructive influence.</note>, and the patient generally during the firſt 24 or 48 hours complained of light ſhivering, which became varied throughout the day with viciſſitudes of heat and partial moiſture on the ſkin ſeeming much inclined to doze from which they were very often a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:026747_0034_0FD1BE00D2A335B0"/>
by frightful dreams, after which they generally became very watchful; as the diſeaſe proceeded the tongue was very little altered from a ſtate of health, except appearing in furrows or chopped and of a bluiſh colour, at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times yellow or brown in the middle and bluiſh at the edges and tip, but ſeldom dry. When ſtools were procured they were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally faetid and frothy, but ſeldom bilious. The urine was variable, generally of a higher colour than natural. Some of theſe ſymptoms which marked the firſt ſtage proceeded ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly to increaſe with a mitigation of others and the riſe of new ones, unleſs an intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſupervened on or before the fourth day and the patient recovered. But moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently inſtead of this intermiſſion, a mere compoſure of ſymptoms only took place which was too often fallacious, during which however the eyes and ſkin ſometimes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came yellow, and the ſick appeared ſo placid to the attendants that they often thought them out of danger. But this treacherous tranquillity ſoon vaniſhed, and the ſecond
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:026747_0035_0FD1BE029CBDC1F0"/>
ſtage commenced with a different train of ſymptoms, and with redoubled violence; for the vigor which before was exceſſive now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined apace, and the diſeaſe put on a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent complexion, the pain in the head and back which was before exceſſive and almoſt intolerable, frequently abated on a ſudden and the fever aſſumed more and more the ſymptoms of the typhus kind; the pulſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came leſs frequent, ſoft and feeble, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even ſlower than in a ſtate of health; the face much leſs fluſhed, the features more tranquil, with a cadaverous aſpect of the countenance, or ſometimes it was but little altered, the ſuffuſion of the eyes frequently increaſed, the heat became conſiderably dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and in ſome caſes leſs than in a ſtate of health, ſkin cool ſometimes with a clammy moiſture on the face neck and back of the hands; the ſickneſs at ſtomach increaſed with a burning ſenſation in the region of it and continual vomiting of frothy matter, at other times bilious ſtreaked with blood. In the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male ſex if the menſes did not flow at their
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:026747_0036_0FD1BE03C81C4F28"/>
uſual period there was generally a quantity of blood brought up by vomiting, accompanied with violent ſtricture about the praecordia, and a ſenſe of weight with great flatulency in the ſtomach and the inteſtines which was very diſtreſſing, for they were generally coſtive, and had not energy ſufficient to expel the wind either upwards or downwards. The tongue in this ſtage trembled much, and with reſpect to colour it was variable, as in the former, frequently nearly natural, at other times covered over with mucus verging to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards black, particularly in the middle, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times dry, but generally moiſt, and not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently it was of a florid colour appearing as if rubbed over with the red particles of the blood, with deep furrows in it or chopped; when the patient was deſired to put it out of the mouth he would continue it there until he was told to draw it in. The thirſt was much augmented with a continual dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the lips and ſauces. The confuſion of the intellects increaſed to a complete deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, the reſtleſſneſs became truly diſtreſſing,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:026747_0037_0FD1BE05E061FE48"/>
and the patient almoſt outrageous, and in ſome caſes maniacal.</p>
               <p>The ſkin and eyes became of a deep yellow color, with the ſame appearance in the urine, which was ſmall in quantity, and diſcharged with difficulty, when the ſkin was not ſuffuſed the urine was turbid, depoſiting a deep brown ſediment. The reſpiration was ſlower than natural except when the body was much agitated by the extreme reſtleſſneſs, accompanied with heavy ſighing, and much debility in all the moving powers of the body, the patient generally lay on his back with his feet drawn up towards his body, nevertheleſs he had ſufficient power when urged by the call of nature to riſe from his bed.</p>
               <p>In the decline of this ſtage the ſkin was ſometimes covered over with petechial erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, appearing like the ſtings of nettles of a dark red colour, principally about the neck and breaſt, accompanied ſometimes with
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:026747_0038_0FD1BE0743CE3A58"/>
haemorrhages from different parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, but theſe ſymptoms more particularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the third and laſt ſtage; the duration of the ſecond ſtage was various, generally according to the violence of the ſymptoms, or to the duration and ſeverity of the preceding ſtage, but it ſeldom laſted longer than 50 or 60 hours before death took place, ſometimes without the occurrence of many of the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the laſt ſtage.</p>
               <p>This ſtage generally commenced with the pulſe becoming very feeble, intermitting, and almoſt imperceptible at the wriſt, frequently not more than 30 or 35 ſtrokes in a minute, * great diminution of the heat of the whole body, except about the praecordia, which ſeemed, if the expreſſion may be uſed, to be <hi>more tenacious of its heat than any other</hi> part of the body, and is the laſt part that ſurrenders it up after death.</p>

The vomiting increaſed, and the matter eject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed was of a dark color, reſembling coffee grounds, ſometimes mixed with blood; great flatulency; haemorrhagies from the different parts of the body; tongue frequently covered over with blood and of a florid colour, at other times black and dry; urine very offenſive, ſometimes a total ſuppreſſion of it, and when

               <head>OF THE METHOD OF CURE.</head>
               <p>IN the cure of the malignant fever, three indications appeared neceſſary: firſt, to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate the inflammatory action; ſecondly, to remove or alleviate certain diſtreſſing ſymptoms which generally occurred, more or leſs, through the ſeveral ſtages of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; thirdly, to ſupport the tone and vigor of the ſyſtem. In effecting the firſt indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the various parts of the antiphlogiſtic regimen ſeemed admirably well adapted. In employing the debilitating powers, a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be formed by the degree of tone and inflammatory action prevalent in the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:026747_0051_0FD1BE2B35E827D8"/>
ſyſtem; and the danger of the diſeaſe paſſing into a ſtate of direct or indirect debility ſhould be ſteadily kept in view. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer from the uſe of too copious evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the latter from a deficiency of them; for it is an eaſy matter to diminiſh the vigor of the ſyſtem, but a very difficult one to rear it when reduced too low: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore every endeavour ſhould be exerted to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the two extremes, for they are both accompanied with imminent danger. By obſerving as near as poſſible the middle courſe, the moſt judicious plan may be purſued.</p>
               <p>The firſt indication was moſt effectually anſwered by the different claſſes of evacuants; among the moſt efficacious was brachial venaeſection.</p>
               <p>About the tenth of Auguſt, which was ſhortly after the diſeaſe made its appearance in this city, bleeding was not attended with
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:026747_0052_0FD1BE30A78BA840"/>
ſucceſs, at leaſt among the ſick under my care; therefore the practice was diſconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and I truſted, with moſt of my medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal brethren, to the milder claſs of evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants until the 12th of September. After having diſſected ſeveral patients, in conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with my friend Dr Phyſic, and on finding the ſtomach and inteſtines highly inflamed, as will appear from the ſubjoined diſſections, I then, reſumed the practice of bleeding upon good grounds and with evidently better effect.—The quantity of blood to be taken away was regulated by the violence of the ſymptoms, age, ſex and habit of body; for, thoſe who were very corpulent did not bear evacuations near ſo well as thoſe of a ſpare make. But no certain rule can abſolutely be laid down, with reſpect to the quantity of blood to be drawn, and whenever it is attempted it muſt be ſubject to conſiderable error, notwithſtanding the number of ounces to be abſtracted has been dictated by ſome authors, whoſe opinions on this ſubject are
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:026747_0053_0FD1BE33CFFEF0B0"/>
various; Dr Williams of Jamaica who wrote in 1750 adviſed plentiful bleeding. Dr Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lary of Barbadoes, uſed veneſection once or twice during the firſt days of the diſeaſe <note n="*" place="bottom">Hillary's Obſervations, page 157.</note>, and Dr Moſely, a more modern writer, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that bleeding ſhould be performed and repeated every ſix or eight hours, and if the ſymptoms be obſtinate and do not abate, it ſhould be executed uſque ad deliquium animi<note n="†" place="bottom">Moſely, page 429.</note>. Dr Blane, in his book on the diſeaſes of ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men obſerves, that if the patient had not a throbbing pulſe, with violent pain in the head and back, it ſhould not be performed; and that without the preſence of thoſe ſymptoms it was extremely dangerous, Dr Warren, a gentleman who had paſſed a conſiderable time in Barbadoes, ſeems much averſe to bleeding, in any ſtage of this diſeaſe." Such are the different opinions of the tropical writers on this ſubject. But during the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the malignant fever in this city,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:026747_0054_0FD1BE354FFD8568"/>
which nearly reſembled that deſcribed under the appellation of the putrid bilious fever of the Weſt India iſlands, I was influenced, in the abſtraction of blood, by the tenſion and fulneſs of the pulſe, the ſeaſon of the year and other circumſtances previouſly obſerved, together with the abatement the ſick experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced of the ſymptoms during the flowing of the blood. But it was very ſeldom that one bleeding, however profuſe it may have been, would put an end to this diſeaſe; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the pain in the head and back may be much mitigated. Yet they too often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with additional violence, at which time, if the pulſe continued full and tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly tenſe, the ſtrength not much impaired, a ſufficient quantity of blood may be taken away to procure an alleviation of the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, which ſhould be repeated as often as they recur in the inflammatory ſtage of the diſeaſe, but it ſeldom appeared neceſſary to be done later than the end of the third day, when it was employed at a more advanced
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:026747_0055_0FD1BE36C82E6FC8"/>
period particularly near the time the diſeaſe was paſſing into its ſecond ſtage, it invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly increaſed the train of terrible ſymptoms which mark this period, with a ſinking in the pulſe that no human effort was able to ſupport. The blood drawn in this ſtage of the diſeaſe very ſeldom perfectly ſeparated into ſerum and craſſamentum; when it did the former was nearly of a natural colour, though ſmall in quantity in proportion to the latter, the craſſamentum was generally of a florid arterial colour, tender in the courſe of the warm weather, as the cool weather ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced and the diſeaſe became more inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory it was ſizy in ſome caſes, with a proportionable degree of contraction of its ſuperior circumference, exhibiting a cup like appearance. This was generally in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the denſity of the craſſamentum and firmneſs of the buffy ſubſtance, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times during the warm weather there was a thick tender ſizy coat on its upper ſurface without the cup or as it is generally called ſalt box appearance. When blood was drawn during the yellow ſuffuſion of the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:026747_0056_0FD1BE3906D2E708"/>
ſkin, the ſerum was of a correſponding co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour but not in the leaſt bitter to the taſte that could be obſerved in a variety of inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and like healthy ſerum it was affected by heat and acids. But to return to the cure at the ſame time that great attention was paid to blood-letting, other remedies were not neglected, eſpecially whatever contribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to diminiſh the quantity of fluids in the ſyſtem and carried off the redundant matter in the firſt paſſages, was proportionably effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious in diminiſhing the inflammatory action, ſuch as cathartics and other evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, which were employed as being ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arily the moſt powerful remedies, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly when alternated with bleeding, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be the moſt judicious way of uſing them, thoſe that were preferred were ſuch on whoſe powerful action reliance could be had and when the ſtomach was ſick required but a ſmall quantity to anſwer the purpoſe at the ſame time being agreeable to the palate.
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:026747_0057_0FD1BE3A15AB4590"/>
Calomel poſſeſſes moſt of thoſe properties, and under certain circumſtances could be adminiſtered with the greateſt advantage. This medicine was firſt employed here in large doſes by Doctor Ruſh, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards generally adopted by the practitioners of this city. It ſhould be given in large doſes until it has the deſired effect and ſhould be expedited in it's operation by giving laxative glyſters; when the functions of the ſtomach were not much deranged which was ſometimes the caſe, the ſaline purgatives were made uſe of, ſuch as ſal Glauberi, which were powerful, leſs ſtimulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than the calomel, and of courſe better an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiphlogiſtics, anſwering the purpoſe equally well, as the object was merely to reduce the energy of the ſyſtem and carry off the bilious matter.</p>
               <p>During the time thoſe remedies are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed it is hardly neceſſary to obſerve that
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:026747_0058_0FD1BE3ED7904D88"/>
the patient ſhould abſtain from all prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of animal food, and when any thing is required it ſhould be gruel, panada, &amp;c. he ſhould uſe cool diluting drinks, ſuch as barley water, apple water, and thoſe that are mild and bland; he may be indulged with ſmall quantities of ripe fruits, which are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable and beneficial by tending to keep the bowels open. Emeties have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times employed in this ſtage of the diſeaſe with a view to evacuate the contents of the ſtomach, but they are ſeldom uſed with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, for their highly ſtimulating power almoſt always increaſed every ſymptom, which of courſe precluded their uſe.</p>
               <p>To relieve the violent pain in the head, bliſters were employed after general evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation had been made uſe of as far as appeared adviſable, but previous to their application to the neck there were ſeveral cupping-glaſſes ſet on the part to be bliſtered, this mode of practice generally afforded conſiderable relief.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="unknown:026747_0059_0FD1BE435AB01B88"/>It was the cuſtom of ſome of the French phyſicians in this city to wrap the patient's body in a blanket that had been wrung out of warm vinegar and water in order to induce ſweat and a ſolution of the diſeaſe. The former it did ſometimes partially effect, but generally with aggravation of almoſt every other ſymptom. In addition to this practice they frequently gave a few grains of nitre and camphor in every ſtage of the diſeaſe, but this appeared trifling with the patient at the expence of his life.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the chambers of the ſick, they ſhould be ſpacious and airy, kept cool, and frequently ſprinkled with vinegar; great attention ſhould be paid to theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as they are of infinite importance to thoſe who frequent the apartments of the ſick, and are highly conducive to the cure of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Having thus far taken notice of the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſuitable to anſwer the firſt indication, I
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:026747_0060_0FD1BE4786F6F968"/>
come now to a conſideration of the ſecond, viz. to alleviate or remove certain diſtreſſing ſymptoms, ſuch as violent vomiting, coſtive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, flatulency, great reſtleſſneſs and want of ſleep, together with the means uſed to divert the deep deſponding ſtate of mind of the patient.</p>
               <p>Firſt, to moderate the exceſſive vomiting too often baffled the art and ſagacity of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry practitioner, however, various means were employed to effect it, which may be divided into external and internal; among the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer was bliſtering the different parts of the body, particularly the region of the ſtomach. This remedy from its obvious good effect in cholera morbus would have induced moſt people to conjecture that it would have been beneficial in this diſeaſe; but from repeated trials it ſeemed to have but little influence on the ſtate of the ſtomach. Bliſters have been recommended to be applied to the legs by Dr Hume of Jamaica, from which he experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:026747_0061_0FD1BE49B6CE2E90"/>
very good effects, but however ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able this mode of practice may have been in the Weſt Indies, it appeared here only to torture the patient's feelings without the leaſt abatement of the vomiting; warm bathing was employed in this ſtage of the diſeaſe, ſometimes with a mitigation of the vomiting, but frequently it increaſed the ſickneſs at the ſtomach and produced ſyncope. In ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the application of flannels wrung out of a warm and ſtrong infuſion of aromatics and applied conſtantly to the region of the ſtomach, were ſometimes ſerviceable, but external ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications taken in the aggregate ſeemed ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to promiſe much advantage.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to internal remedies, almoſt every antiemetic was employed that the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of phyſicians had found uſeful, but frequently without having the deſired effect, ſuch as the ſaline mixture in the ſtate of ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferveſcence; the infuſion of rad.

<pb n="54" facs="unknown:026747_0062_0FD1BE4B08254FD8"/>
peppermint julep with tinct. Thebaic. and the different articles of drink both cool and tepid, ſuch as barley water, toaſt water, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple water, lemonade, chamomile tea, and a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of other drinks during the inflammatory period, after which ſmall doſes of tinct. cort. Peruv. with Spt. lavend. comp. was adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with a good effect, particularly when the ſymptoms of violent inflammation of the ſtomach did not contraindicate its uſe; and it was eſpecially ſerviceable in ſuch patients who had been accuſtomed to an irregular mode of life, and drank to exceſs of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liquors; for when every other article was immediately rejected it generally continued on the ſtomach, the mucilaginous vitriolic mixture<note n="*" place="bottom">Which is mucilage of gum arabic acidulated with elixir of vitriol.</note> was uſed to advantage, and ſmall quantities of wine, porter, cyder, or brandy and water was of ſervice by giving tone to the debilitated ſtomach.</p>

                  <pb n="55" facs="unknown:026747_0063_0FD1BE4C87BE5C60"/>Freſh buttermilk was frequently found grateful to the ſick and very beneficial as an antiemetic even when from the ſymptoms it might be concluded that the ſtomach was highly inflamed. Likewiſe a teaſpoonful of crem. tart. diſſolved in ſugar and water was known to ſtay on the ſtomach and paſs through the bowels, when every other medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine and drink was inſtantly rejected: this medicine was adminiſtered with a view to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move coſtiveneſs, which ſhould always be guarded againſt in this diſeaſe, but the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient finding it ſo effectual in ſtopping vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he frequently had recourſe to it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being coſtive with the ſame good effect; in ſeveral other caſes it was made uſe of but was too often inſtantly rejected; caſtor oil adminiſtered under ſimilar circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had the like effect; but this was not often the caſe, although I have frequently known it to continue on the ſtomachs of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple violently ſea-ſick and remove coſtiveneſs when drink of every kind was immediately
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:026747_0064_0FD1BE4EDF2BA128"/>
thrown up. During the exceſſive ſickneſs at the ſtomach in the progreſs of this diſeaſe, it may be obſerved that generally the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable medicine and drinks were leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently rejected than thoſe of an unpleaſant quality, for no ſooner did a draught of any liquid reach the ſtomach than it was inſtantly rejected with violence, it is not to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended from the quality but merely from the quantity, therefore the patient ſhould not take more than a table-ſpoonful at a time, his own feeling with reſpect to fulneſs and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at the ſtomach ſhould always determine the frequency and quantity of drinks to be taken, however inſatiably thirſty he may be, in conjunction with theſe precautions the body ſhould be kept as quiet as poſſible, for the leaſt accelerated motion of it frequently brought on a paroxyſm of vomiting. During this perturbed ſtate of the ſtomach Dr Moſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thinks a diaphoretic plan ſhould be adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with James's powders, in order to relieve the internal irritation by revulſion, and enable
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:026747_0065_0FD1BE54C7539470"/>
the ſtomach to bear purgatives, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, ſays he, carries off the offending hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour <note place="bottom">Page 448.</note> with due deference to the experience of Moſely I cannot help diſſenting from him in opinion, and ſeem to think that he has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt forgotten the irritable and even frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inflamed ſtate of the ſtomach, or ſurely he would not have recommended an irritat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing medicine to ſoothe an irritation which would come very near in contact with the villous coat of the ſtomach, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from its irritating quality would induce a contraction of that viſcus in order to expel it, accompanied with exquiſite torture, a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice which few phyſicians would not conſider as highly erroneous and extremely preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial.</p>
               <p>To remove coſtiveneſs and flatulency, which were extremely diſtreſſing through the courſe of this diſeaſe, was always a very difficult matter to accompliſh, particularly when there
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:026747_0066_0FD1BE5A282BD810"/>
was much ſickneſs at the ſtomach, with vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, for the inteſtines were frequently ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſluggiſh in their action, and the ſtomach generally rejected every claſs of purgative medicines. When this was the caſe, there was no alternative but that of keeping the bowels open by purgative or laxative glyſters, and thoſe were ſubject to conſiderable incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience when they could be adminiſtered, which was not often the caſe, for they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cleared but the lower part of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines, whilſt thoſe approximating the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach were generally diſtended with faeces, and was an inceſſant ſource of irritation to the ſympathizing ſtomach. Therefore when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there was a chance of ſucceſs in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of purgative medicines they were always attempted, for they generally cleared the whole tract of inteſtinal canal, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently procured a mitigation of the vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but if they were rejected, they were not frequently repeated, for fear of exhauſting the ſtrength of the patient without contribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:026747_0067_0FD1BE5B368B8810"/>
to his relief. By thus keeping the inteſtinal canal clear of faeces, you in ſome meaſure ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viated flatulency. But in an advanced period of the diſeaſe, the ſtomach and inteſtines were ſo much debilitated, that they frequently had not energy ſufficient, when apparently clear of faeces, to expel the wind either upwards or downwards, but it continued as it were ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary tormenting the patient. During this ſtate when the ſtomach was tolerably tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil, a ſtrong infuſion of ſemen faeneculi was adminiſtered mixed in a ſmall quantity of brandy with advantage, particularly when alternated with ſome agreeable tonic, ſuch as the mucilaginous vitriolic mixture already recommended, if nothing contraindicated its uſe, or a ſmall quantity of a ſtrong infuſion of ſpices, which ſometimes afforded relief, but thoſe ſymptoms too frequently baffled every attempt to remove them.</p>
               <p>The next circumſtance that commands at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is the extreme reſtleſſneſs and want of
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:026747_0068_0FD1BE5D706217D8"/>
ſleep. Generally by quieting the former the fatigue from the long wakefulneſs will fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently induce the latter. This indication was moſt effectually anſwered by opium, the propriety of employing of which has enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the attention of many of the tropical wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by one it is much approved of, <note n="*" place="bottom">Hillary's obſervations, page 160.</note> by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other it is abſolutely condemned very juſtly during the inflammatory period, as being highly ſtimulating and acrid, the uſe of which ſays he muſt be attended with immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger.<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr Moſely.</note> In the ſubſequent ſtages good effects have been experienced from the uſe of it, particularly in the ſecond and laſt ſtages of the diſeaſe, in the former by inducing ſleep, conſequently refreſhing the patient and ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling him in ſome meaſure to reſiſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme violence of the diſeaſe, in the latter it afforded conſolation by lulling the inquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and ſmoothing the avenue to death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="unknown:026747_0069_0FD18D1F38F8E660"/>With regard to the laſt head of the ſecond indication, viz. that of diverting the gloomy and deſponding thoughts of the patient, this was attended with almoſt inſurmountable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties however it ſhould be always attempted by the moſt encouraging language and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of a complete recovery, for on this the favourable termination of the diſeaſe much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends. The patient ſhould not be told that he has the yellow fever even if demanded, for I have known a patient faint in this diſeaſe from an unguarded expreſſion, and afterwards die apparently from a ſlight attack, for no art could perſuade him that his diſſolution was not approaching with haſty ſpeed. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore great circumſpection ſhould be obſerved and the patient encouraged with as much conſiſtency and boldneſs as poſſible, for moſt of the ſick that were ſlightly indiſpoſed, would ſeize hold of the leaſt dubious expreſſion, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly if dropped by the phyſician, reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their recovery. But after doing this you ſhould take an opportunity of ſtating the
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:026747_0070_0FD1BE60C76F4260"/>
circumſtances clearly to the connections with the proſpect of ſucceſs, or if you ſhould not ſucceed the ignorant and illiberal will cenſure your conduct.</p>
               <p>I come now to the third and laſt indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which was of all others the moſt difficult to accompliſh, viz. to ſupport the ſinking tone and periſhing vigor of the ſyſtem, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication is applicable to the ſecond, but more particularly to the laſt ſtage of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, for the latter being an augmentation of the ſymptoms of the former, ſometimes much diverſified, requiring more powerful remedies. Whenever a change was perceived in the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem indicating that debility was commencing, the nature of the diſeaſe muſt be conſidered as materially different, conſequently requiring a particular mode of treatment; the patient ſhould not be reſtricted to a vegetable diet or watery drinks, eſpecially if there are no vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſymptoms indicating inflammation of the

ſtomach <note n="*" place="bottom">May not all thoſe ſymptoms of increaſed action and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation in the veſſels of the ſtomach at this period of the diſeaſe, when the ſyſtem is ſo much debilitated, be ſupported by an atony ſubſiſting in the diſeaſed veſſels and requiring ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muli to remove it, ſimilar to thoſe recommended by authors to cure what is called paſſive inflammation.</note>, ſtimuli ſhould be employed both external and internal, according to the ſtate of debility prevalent in the ſyſtem, ſuch as bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the different parts of the body in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to excite the ſyſtem; for the application there when deferred to a more advanced pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod was rather of diſſervice, for the ſtrength of the patient was ſo far exhauſted, that the parts bliſtered ſoon became black and ſphace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, ſometimes attended with profuſe hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhagy. Therefore their application was diſcontinued in the laſt ſtage of the diſeaſe. Waſhing the whole body in brandy and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or when that could not be complied with, the face, breaſt and hands, which always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved refreſhing to the ſick; cold water thrown over the head and ſhoulders, morning and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:026747_0072_0FD1BE63E88D5CE8"/>
frequently had a good effect, by giving vigor and ſupporting the excitement already ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by ſtimuli; likewiſe it invariably indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſleep, with a gentle moiſture on the ſkin<note n="*" place="bottom">The following caſe, corroborates the practice of cold ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this ſtage of the diſeaſe. In September laſt a miller reſiding on Pennypeck, caught the malignant fever by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into Philadelphia; during his illneſs, the phyſician who attended him took the infection from him, and in the courſe of the diſorder became delirious, and about the third day from the attack <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

At the time of indiſpoſition, when the patient elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, it may be concluded that he was in the ſecond ſtage of the diſeaſe, which is the time cold bathing ſhould be employed.</note>. In addition to the external ſtimuli already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, ſmapiſms ſhould be applied to the feet and when there were no ſymptoms contrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating the uſe of internal remedies, ſuch as violent ſymptoms of inflammation in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, they ſhould be adminiſtered, and one would imagine, from the declining vigor of the
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:026747_0073_0FD1BE659044FA60"/>
ſyſtem, that bark as ſtanding foremoſt in the claſs of tonic medicines would be eminently ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <note n="*" place="bottom">The intermittent and remittent fevers, mentioned in a note in the hiſtory of this diſeaſe, were cured by emetics and the bark, the latter continued on the ſtomach as well as uſual.</note> in ſupporting the energy of the ſyſtem. Upon this ground it is to be apprehended that Doctor Kuhn recommended the cortex and wine in this diſeaſe, the former of which in ſome caſes was ſerviceable particularly when the functions of the ſtomach were not much deranged, but nauſea and vomiting were ſo invariably preſent, that in almoſt all caſes in whatever manner or form it was adminiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it always, at leaſt in my practice, proved detrimental <note n="†" place="bottom">Except to uſe it in ſmall doſes to quiet the perturbed ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach—given under the circumſtances formerly mentioned.</note>, particularly when given by the mouth; for it ſeldom if ever failed to derange the ſtate of the ſtomach in ſuch a manner that it was not ſuſceptible of retaining any other medicine or drink, when adminiſtered in the form of glyſters mixed with London porter
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:026747_0074_0FD1BE68D7425C68"/>
and laudanum it did not ſeem to have any good effect, for they generally produced a painful ſenſation over the whole abdomen. This was ſometimes the caſe even when a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon laxative glyſter was given, ſo that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient could ſcarcely retain it a moment. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time bark was employed, wine was given, beginning with claret or any other weak wine; but if there was great defect in the vigor of the ſyſtem, Madeira was ſoon found neceſſary, if wine could not be taken by the patient, brandy diluted with water, por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or cyder may be ſubſtituted; theſe ſhould be increaſed in quantity, according to the ſtate of the ſtomach and degree of feebleneſs in the pulſe, at the ſame time elix. vit. was employed as a tonic; for the bark the moſt powerful of all tonics, was found to diſagree with the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and was therefore always omitted, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept during the convaleſcent ſtate, and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire dependence was placed in the medicine recommended, together with the wine or its ſubſtitute which ſhould be admiſtered in large
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:026747_0075_0FD1BE6F698322E0"/>
quantities, and continued until the pulſe from being ſmall and ſinking, became full, round, and tolerably ſtrong, the heat more equally diffuſed, the delirium abating and the patient becoming more chearful; ſuch were frequently the effects of thoſe ſtimuli, and even when the ſtrength appeared almoſt exhauſted, they would revive and keep up the ſpark of life, and ſometimes in the moſt deplorable caſes, reſtore perfect health and vigor.</p>
               <p>However great caution ſhould be obſerved in the adminiſtration of wine that when the moſt urgent ſymptoms are mitigated, and ſome of them removed, that the quantity ſhould be diminiſhed gradatim; but ſhould the danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſymptoms return, it muſt be augmented with caution, for fear of hurrying the excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment beyond the powers of the ſyſtem indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing indirect debility with haemorrhagies from different parts of the body: this is not unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the caſe with thoſe ſtimuli, and cold bathing, particularly if the ſtomach is not in a fit
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:026747_0076_0FD1BE73B5E18C70"/>
ſituation to receive ſuch nutritious articles as would impart a ſufficient degree of energy to render the fluctuating excitement more perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and equable: if an adequate quantity of the abovementioned ſtimuli cannot be taken to raiſe the excitement, ſmall doſes of volatile alkali may be given with advantage, increaſing the doſe as the urgent ſymptoms may demand. This practice was more expedient if the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient could take ſome nouriſhment that was light and agreeable, ſuch as panada or gruel, or if there was a ſlight return of appetite, ſome preparation of animal food ſhould be given, ſuch as weak broth, and at times a few oyſters, if the ſtomach would bear them; however, great caution ſhould be obſerved in making uſe of ſolid food. If any is adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, oyſters certainly are the moſt proper, as they are the moſt eaſy of digeſtion, affording a ſufficient quantity of nouriſhment.</p>
               <p>Having thus far imperfectly ſketched the different remedies found moſt expedient and
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:026747_0077_0FD1BE762A04ED70"/>
beneficial in the cure of this diſeaſe, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains only to take notice of the conduct to be obſerved by the patient during the conva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcent ſtate, which was generally tedious, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly when the diſeaſe had been remedied by profuſe evacuations, the recovery was conſiderably protracted and precarious, the patient acquiring ſtrength but ſlowly, and ſometimes having a tendency to aſcites: du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the recovery the patients ſhould be very circumſpect in their conduct for fear of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe of fever; they ſhould chooſe food moſt eaſy of digeſtion; eat moderately; and take a doſe of bark two or three times a-day, to aſſiſt digeſtion and invigorate the debilitated ſyſtem. In addition to this medicine a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral quantity of wine ſhould be allowed, but never ſuffered to be carried beyond the chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful glaſs, or that moment it will become prejudicial. With theſe, moderate exerciſe ſhould be conjoined, for on it the recovery much depends; the bowels ſhould be kept open; the night air avoided; and every other
