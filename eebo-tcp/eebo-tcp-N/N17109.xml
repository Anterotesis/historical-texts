            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <p>Sometime ago an aged pious matron of this city, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated as follows, reſpecting a pious girl that lived with her and loved that which is good. But had heard an evil report of the Rev. Mr. George Whitefield, that he was a falſe teacher and impoſed on the people, and knew nothing about the goſpel, and never preached a good ſermon in his life.— So it fell out one day, that ſhe was requeſting her miſtreſs to read ſome good book to her, but objected ſtrongly againſt Mr. Whitefield's writings, and did not like them at all. However her miſtreſs conſented to read to her a ſermon, and the girl approved of it exceedingly; and ſaid that ſhe never heard a better ſermon in her life.—Then her miſtreſs informed her who the author was viz. Mr. Whitefield. The honeſt girl began to weep and wring her hands and ſaid, "that ſhe was the vileſt and moſt wicked wretch on earth to deſpiſe and reject ſuch a worthy and faithful ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt, by the influence of a falſe report, without any foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation."</p>
                     <p>The above gentlewoman informed me, that ſhe had heard an ill report of Baron Sweedenbourg's works, but not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to depend upon mere hearſay, was determined to ſend for the Baron's book: And having read a part of it, and found it be a jargon of enthuſiaſm; now ſays the lady, "I judge for myſelf, and am ſatisfied; the report which I heard is true.—Therefore I adviſe all carnal and ungodly people, who deſpiſe and ridicule the Rev. George Whitefield, or his writings, to prove his works by the ſacred ſcriptures, read and judge for themſelves—I alſo requeſt them ſeriouſly to conſider that our bleſſed Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, was deſpiſed and ridiculed alſo, by the hypocritical Scribes and Phariſees of his day, and the moſt notorious lies laid to his charge viz. They ſaid that "Jeſus Chriſt was a glutton and a drunkard a deceiver of the people, and poſſeſſed of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil," &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>I am alſo informed that a certain gentleman now living in this city: Who is one of the firſt rate writers, and a very excellent poet; this gentleman informed a friend of mine, that he peruſes the Baron's works out of curioſity to know what he had to ſay—And looks on the Baron's performance in no other light than a whimſical novel —And I have it from good authority, therefore can avouch it as an authentic truth, that every miniſter in this city, together with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of pious chriſtians, who in fact diſprove the Baron's works, and the reaſon is obvious, becauſe they are unſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and have a great tendency to diſhonour God and poiſon men's ſouls.—</p>

               <l>Mankind ſo wicked and profane,</l>
               <l>Their vices all I cannot name:</l>
               <l>The Sabbath like a market day,</l>
               <l>Thus fools do ſport their time away.</l>
               <l>In winter time, when weather's cold,</l>
               <l>How very dreadfull to behold,</l>
               <l>☞ Hundreds ſkaiting on the ice,</l>
               <l>They are ſo given up to vice.</l>

               <l>To ſell good things and ſee the ſport;</l>
               <l>Righteouſneſs doth a nation bleſs,</l>
               <l>But Sin doth bring a heavy curſe.</l>
               <l>My heart would break to hold my peace,</l>

               <l>Give a rough ſketch, then ſilent ſtand,</l>
               <l>And leave it to ſome abler hand.</l>
               <l>You know the common certain lot,</l>
               <l>Reprovers they muſt have a blot.</l>
               <l>Some thouſands they may take offence,</l>
               <l>And ſay, this ſcribbler hath no ſenſe:</l>
               <l>The learned, they will frown and ſay,</l>
               <l>His jingle I will caſt away,</l>
               <l>He might have wrote in pleaſing ſtile,</l>

               <l>"Pope and Fordyce, theſe are the men,</l>
