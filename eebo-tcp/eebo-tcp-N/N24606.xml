            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE nation of Israel, being the chosen people of GOD, this was the primary reason of that affection towards them, expressed by the Psalmist, in the words I have now read, and excited that disposition which he felt, to wish their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, and to rejoice with them on every prosperous occasion. He might be induced also to this, from his relation to that people, and from considering himself as one of them. So far as the interest he took in the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of Israel, arose from this last consideration, hereby a public spirit and a national affection is recommended to others, to whatever nation or country they appertain:
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032582_0004_0FF3887063147BE8"/>
Especially to such as are in a situation favourable to liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to virtue, and general happiness.</p>
            <p>THE necessity of a civil government, the local situation of mankind, and their different dispositions and interests, have induced them to form into many different nations. If that moral rectitude and innocency, with which our first parents were introduced into the garden of Eden, had remained with them and their posterity, there would perhaps have been no occasion for civil power; and though they should have multiplied over the face of the earth, they might all have been one people, living in a voluntary manner, according to the dictates of justice, truth, and mercy, and in all respects as they ought to do: But having become sinners, and by their apostasy lost the higher principles of virtue, which they originally possessed, hence from the first beginning of the propagation of our species, there has been occasion for the energy and control of parental authority, and civil power. Even in the family of Adam, one brother was wantonly and cruelly murdered by another; and in the course of about fifteen hundred years, the violence and wickedness in the earth, arose to such a height, that GOD saw fit to destroy the whole race of mankind, except Noah and his family, by a flood. After this, though there was a check upon the corruptions of man, his age being reduced, yet the evil propensities of human nature, made it necessary as man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind again multiplied, that they should be formed into political bodies, and placed under the power of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032582_0005_0FF3887255F49B00"/>
civil government; and GOD is represented as prescribing this mode of subsistence for them:—<hi>Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations: Ask thy father, and he will shew thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thy elders, and they will tell thee; when the most high divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">DEUT. XXXII.8.</note> These nations which were soon incorporated after the flood, have from time to time, been multiplying into other nations, and will thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to do, until the kingdoms of men shall universally become the kingdom of our LORD and SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>THE multiplied nations of men take place under different forms and circumstances, and like indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual persons, are distinguished from one another in their worldly prosperity, and the members of some of them have a much greater occasion than others, of attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their country and nation: And what I propose in this discourse, is to notice the particular cause that we have of affection, towards the nation of which we are a part, of rejoicing when it is prospered, and of being made glad when it falls under the smiles of divine providence.</p>
            <p>AS it is the will of GOD, that the children of men, who are more immediately connected, whether by a natural or civil relation, should be under peculiar at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032582_0006_0FF38876380FAB58"/>
for their mutual benefit and happiness: So in general their nature dictates them to a cordial affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, not only towards their families, but their country. Hadad, though he had been long in Egypt, did not loose this impulse towards Idumea. <hi>He said to Pharaoh, let me depart, that I may go to mine own country. Then Pharaoh said unto him, but what hast thou lacked with me, that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? and he answered nothing: Howbeit let me go in any wise.</hi>
               <note place="bottom">I. KINGS, XI.22.</note> Besides the dictates of nature, obligations do arise upon the members of a community, to be well affected citizens and subjects, from that protection which is afforded, by the authority they are under, to their lives and property. On these considerations, it appears incumbent on men in all parts of the world, to be friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the nations to which they respectively belong: But various things may be thought upon and mentioned, as what, in a special and peculiar manner, may serve to excite in us a love of the country and people to which we appertain: as</p>
            <p n="1">1st. OUR originating in general from the same stock, and standing towards one another in a natural kindred relation. Such affinity by blood is endearing. Abime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lech, thought it a good reason, why he should have the esteem of the people of Sheehem, that he was one of the same lineage—<hi>remember,</hi> said he, <hi>that I am your
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032582_0007_0FF38877FADDDEB8"/>
bone and your flesh: And their hearts were inclined to follow Abimelech; for they said, he is our brother.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">JUDGES, IX.2.</note> Paul was willing to do and suffer much for his brethren and kinsmen, according to the flesh.</p>
            <p>THE people of these United States merit our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and esteem, not only as <hi>kindred,</hi> but by reason of the superior descent, which attends us and them consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed collectively. We have not the same occasion with some others, to say, <hi>our mother was an Hittite, and our father an Amorite.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">EZEK. XVI.45.</note> We have proceeded from pious and illustrious ancestors, and though we ought not to be vain in considering ourselves the children of such progenitors, yet it is a circumstance that gives us respectability, and which ought to endear us to one another. The example of Paul will support us in this, who after he became an apostle, exulted in his relation to a certain tribe— <hi>If any other man thinketh that he hath whereof he might trust in the flesh, I more; of the stock of Isreal, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">PHIL. III.5.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2d. WE appertain to a nation inhabiting an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive and fertile country, happily situated for husbandry and commerce, and all the amusing and profitable em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of life. Our land, like that into which Joshua led the children of Israel, is a land of hills and of waters, of health and plenty, affording in various parts
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032582_0008_0FF387702A16B820"/>
of it, the finest of wheat, and in all the different climates, some kind of useful produce, in great abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. A nation of brethren, thus situated in a good and large land, where they have already made great improvements, and have room for increase still through many generations, until their empire shall equal, if not exceed, that of any in the known world; has reason for the exercise of a particular affection among the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of it, accompanied with a solicitude for its preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, through the present and future ages, entire and undivided.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. THE free civil constitution and good government which our nation possesses, renders it worthy of our particular attachment.</p>
            <p>THE situation of a people is materially affected by that form of government, under which they are placed; and that which has fallen to our lot, is wisely calculated to be a terror to evil doers, and a praise to them that do well. Our government in some respects, partakes of a different form from what has ever before been tried or experienced among men, and being the effect of our own choice, we ought chearfully to acquiesce in, and abide by it. We cannot indeed, pretend to say, that it is a form of government particularly pointed out and directed to in the scriptures, in perference to all others; for the word of inspiration does not intermeddle in matters of this kind, any further than to teach, that civil government is the ordinance of GOD, for good,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032582_0009_0FF3887AE8071200"/>
and that mankind in the use and administration of it, ought to be influenced by the fear of GOD, and a sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast regard to equity and righteousness. GOD hath not dealt so with any nation, as he did with the Jews. To them in the time of Moses, he gave a certain express form of government, which they were to observe until SHILOH should come, but after he came, who was CHRIST the LORD, the sceptre departed from Judah, and the lawgiver from between his feet. And as no nation or kingdom of men, was after this, chosen of GOD, and made a peculiar people unto himself, as the Jews were: So he gave no law to any nation or kingdom, as such, but left each one to enjoy the mode of civil government, which they had already adopted, or to assume any other form, which from their situation and circumstances they might judge to be best.</p>
            <p>UNDER the gospel dispensation, which came by CHRIST, the <hi>church</hi> of GOD was to be planted in a progressive man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, among the various nations of the earth. To <hi>this church,</hi> scattered in small societies over the world, a sacred constitution is given, and particular laws and ordinances, by which it ought to be governed in all religious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. But to civil and political bodies of men, GOD has given no civil and political laws, except what are to be taken from that sense which men have of right and wrong, or from the general instruction of the scriptures concerning the duty of one man towards another: the form of government, therefore, that our nation is under, is not to be conceived of as a form,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032582_0010_0FF3887FED932510"/>
that is particularly pointed out and prescribed in the word of GOD. Nor do we know that it is the best form which could possibly be adopted, for men of the greatest improvement and experience, have in all ages, been divided in their sentiments upon government, some choosing what is called a monarchy, others a democracy or aristocracy, and some a mixture of each of these. But we have reason to be highly satisfied with our government. It is congenial to our education, to our ideas and national dispositions. It is the fabric, the collective wisdom of the nation, and the fruit of much study and application, used by our most able citizens and distinguished patriots, who gave every evidence in the power of men, of a sincere and zealous concern to do their best in this important matter, for themselves and their country. Yet supposing that they might be mistaken, they have made provision for any amendment of the constitution, which experience may teach to be necessary. We have also to consider, that our civil officers are so universally elective, and <hi>frequently,</hi> that the people can change public characters as they find occasion, and consequently always have public measures as much under their control as can be best for them. Further, it is to be considered, that our government has merited our esteem from experience. It has been attended with great and happy effects for a number of years, especially from the time of its being compleated by the federal constitution and laws. A spirit of vigour has been given to all kinds of business. Our husbandry,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032582_0011_0FF38881B3F3F128"/>
navigation, commerce, revenue, and population, have increased beyond all previous calculation. These favours have been sweetened by the peace and tranquillity which the several States, and the individual subjects of them, have enjoyed. With such a Government our late chief executive, in the exercise of his preeminent wisdom and prudence, has given us reason to say as Turtulus did to Felix, <hi>By thee we enjoy great quietness, and very worthy deeds are done, by thy providence, unto this nation.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">ACTS XXIV.2.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4th. WE have peculiar reason for attachment to our nation, because herein is planted the church of GOD, under the full enjoyment of the blessings of the Gospel; with liberty of conscience, and equal rights given by our authority to all denominations of professing christians. Our situation in this respect affords to us the prospect of the merciful interpositions of divine Providence, <hi>for the</hi> LORD <hi>loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">PSAL. CXXXII, 13.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE house of Obed-Edom was greatly prospered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the ark of the LORD, which for a season was deposited there: So a nation where the people of GOD dwell may be blessed on their account. If there had been ten righteous persons in Sodom that city would have been spared.—For the elects sake the days of distress were shortened in Jerusalem. The religion of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel being embraced and upheld among a people, does
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032582_0012_0FF388845CA71540"/>
also afford a favourable prospect in respect to their morals and manners.
<q>The christian religion (as one justly observes<note n="*" place="bottom">DR. TAPPAN.</note>) properly stated and enforced, has a peculiar favourable influence upon the present social state of mankind.—It inculcates the most extended, the most active, the most self-denying benevolence: It links us to the great brotherhood of man; yea, it unites us to the universe, to eternity, and to GOD; the head and sum of both: It levels all the haughty feelings of superior ranks or abilities, and places true greatness in humble, condescending, elevated good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness. By this, as well as by constantly pointing us to those two great levellers, death and an endless retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution, it introduces a kind of generous republican equality among the different orders and conditions of society: It equally regards and secures the interest of all the members of the community, by that great rule of equity, <hi>Whatever ye would that men should do unto you, do ye even so to them.</hi> By presenting the same motives, and rewards of virtue, to the weak and the strong, and by urging both to the secret acts of goodness, from a regard to the approving eye and final recompense of the SUPREME JUDGE: It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides a steady support, a constant opportunity, a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal engagement to the practice of virtue. We may add, it regulates and refines those important social connexions and duties, the <hi>conjugal, parental</hi> and

                  <hi>filial,</hi> in a manner highly favourable to the order and happiness of human society. In a word, the spirit of our religion is uniting and peaceable: It is loyal, patriotic and free: It is the life and support of good government, and of rational liberty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THEY among us who believe in this religion, which is of such salutary consequence, do in some instances fall into different opinions, and modes of worship and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, but we are happy in the provision which the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution makes for the equal support of all who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offensive, as members of state. Thus religious liberty is enjoyed, a favour which those are destitute of, where civil establishments of religion take place, even though toleration should be exercised towards dissenting christians. Dr. Price, with a particular view to these states, makes the following observations:
<q>All men of all religions, ought to be considered by a state as equally entitled to its protection, as far as they demean themselves honestly and peaceably. <hi>Toleration</hi> can take place only where there is a civil establishment of a particular mode of religion; that is, when a predominant sect enjoys <hi>exclusive</hi> advantages, and makes the encouragement of its own mode of worship, a part of the constitution of the state; but at the same time, thinks fit to <hi>suffer</hi> the exercise of other modes of faith and worship.</q>
—He adds,
<q>Thanks be to GOD, the new American states are at present, strangers to such establishments. In this respect as well as many others, they have shewn in
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032582_0014_0FF3888715478E38"/>
framing their constitutions, a degree of wisdom and liberality, which is above all praise.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN we thus contemplate the agreeable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of our nation, and the cause we have of attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to it: Let us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. ACKNOWLEDGE the obligations we are under to ALMIGHTY GOD, and the gracious interpositions of his providence, for the public blessings which we enjoy. <hi>Promotion cometh neither from the East nor the West, nor the South, but</hi> GOD <hi>is judge; he setteth up one and putteth down another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF men are instrumental of good to a public com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, they are made so by GOD—who said of Cyrus, <hi>He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure; even saying to Jerusalem, thou shalt be built; and to the temple, thy foundation shall be laid.</hi> It becomes us therefore, to ascribe all our greatness and prosperity, ultimately unto him. <hi>Thine O</hi> LORD <hi>is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty; for all that is in the heaven and in the earth, is thine; thine is the kingdom, O</hi> LORD, <hi>and thou art exalted as head above all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. LET the subject, and the joyful occasion of the day, call into our grateful remembrance, those friends of our country, who have been more especially instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in procuring these privileges, which we enjoy as a free and independent nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:032582_0015_0FF3888A5F147F48"/>SOME of them are sleeping in the dust, and were allowed, like Moses, only a prospect of the good, into the possession of which they were leading and conducting the people. Thus it has been with two eminent servants of the public, introduced, for a time, to the chief seat of government in this Commonwealth.<note n="*" place="bottom">GOV. BOWDOIN, and GOV. HANCOCK.</note> Others have retired into the shade of private life, after having acted in a public sphere long enough, as Caesar said he had done, for nature or for glory. These characters, which have distinguished themselves in the cabinet and in the field, together with those who are still conducting the great affairs of this country, as our political fathers, we ought to arise and call blessed. Particularly should we thus honour the late President of the United States, whose vigilant, able, prudent, and benevolent exertions for the people, give us reason to say concerning him as a patriot, <hi>many sons have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. LET us consider the danger we are in, of having our public prosperity interrupted, and the measures, which we ought to pursue, as friends to our country and nation.—All human affairs are fluctuating. We, who were born a nation, as it were, in a day, may suddenly meet with ruin. The kingdom of heaven, is the only kingdom that is immoveable. The great Babylon itself is fallen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is fallen. The glory of Sparta, the liberty of Athens and of Rome, were soon lost.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:032582_0016_0FF3888EA94838D8"/>
The city of Tyre, where wealth abounded, and festivity and joy reigned, was brought into desolation and sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row—<hi>Howl, ye inhabitants of the isle—is this your joyous city? Her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn—the crowning city, whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the honourable of the earth!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE are thus admonished, that our national as well as personal prosperity is in a precarious uncertain situation; and we have a call in a particular manner, to attend to the danger that arises from the animosities of foreign nations, who without due regard to our welfare, may wish to engage us in their political views and interests, and in case of disappointment, treat us with injustice. Such treatment we have indeed already received, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of late, from the republic of France; as we learn by the communications, made by the president to the congress, now convened, and at present, the diplomatic intercourse between that nation and ours, is suspended. Such a rupture bodes ill to the American states. And while we refer the healing of it, to our more public characters, it becomes us as private citizens, to guard against the warm spirit of parties and factions among ourselves; particularly to beware of a defection from the government of the United States, and acting in contrariety to it. With the apprehension of such a defection, our chief Executive appears to be alarmed, or rather with the designs of France, to bring it about, and feelingly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses the importance it is of to the people, to shew themselves the firm and stedfast friends of their own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032582_0017_0FF3877E65CF2748"/>
The speech of the president, says he, i. e. of the president of the directory of France,
<q>discloses senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments more alarming than the refusal of a minister, because more dangerous to our independence and union; and at the same time is studiously marked with indignities towards the government of the United States: It evinces a disposition to separate the people of the United States; to persuade them that they have different affections, principles, and interests, from those of their fellow citizens, whom they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves have chosen to manage their common concerns, and thus to produce divisions fatal to our peace. Such attempts ought to be repelled, with a decision which shall convince France, and the world, that we are not a divided, degraded people, regardless of national honour, character, and interest.</q>
The peace of our land, and the prosperity of our nation, we should also seek, by cultivating a spirit of subordination, in the families and societies with which we are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly connected, by training up those under our care to order and rule, and by giving that education which may inform the mind, direct the judgment, regulate the passions, and eventually lead to such behaviour as may be of happy effect to the community where they dwell. Idleness, dissipation, and sensual extravagances of every kind, should be avoided by us, and a life of industry, temperance, sobriety, and godliness, carefully and perseveringly pursued. <hi>Righteousness exalteth a nation, but sin is the reproach of any people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:032582_0018_0FF3875EE7186C40"/>4. WHILE we cherish patriotism in our breasts, let us not confine our love to those of our own country, but extend it to all mankind.
<q>The love of our country, (says an author before cited) is then only a noble passion, when it engages us to promote the internal happiness of our country, and to defend its rights and liberties against domestic and foreign invasion; maintaining at the same time, an equal regard to the rights and liberties of other countries. But this has not been its common effects; on the contrary, it has in general, been nothing but a spirit of rivalship be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween different communities, producing contention, and a thirst for conquest and dominion. What is his country, to a Russian, a Turk, a Spaniard, &amp;c. but a spot where he enjoys no rights, and is disposed of by his owners as if he was a beast? And what is his love to his country, but an attachment to depredation and slavery? What was the love of their country amongst the Jews, but a wretched partiality for themselves, and a proud contempt of other nations? Amongst the Romans also, what was it, however great in many of its exertions, but a principle holding together a band of robbers, in their attempt to crush all liberty but their own? Christianity has wisely omitted to recommend this principle: It has done what is infinitely better.</q>
It has recommended universal benevolence, from which enemies and those of other nations, are not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded. The language of it is, <hi>do good to all men,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032582_0019_0FF38895156FCB00"/>
if thine enemy hunger feed him,</hi> compassionate and help him in trouble, as the Samaritin did the Jew, who fell among thieves. GO THOU AND DO LIKEWISE.</p>
