            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE author of this ſhort Tour in Holland, had not an idea of ſubmitting his remarks in that country to the publick, at the time they were made—The careleſs and irregular manner in which it is written will fully evince this truth.—However, as ſeveral of his friends importuned him to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it, in its original native ſtate, he has aſſented; having previouſly ſolicited the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did criticiſm of the celebrated author of <hi>M'Fingal,</hi> from whoſe letter on this ſubject the author has made free to extract the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing remarks, viz.</p>
            <p>"IN America we know little of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land—nor do I believe the Engliſh in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:023039_0003_0FBB744DDDCF2250"/>
know much more. The nobility and gentry, who take the tour of Europe, ſeldom viſit the Netherlands, and the remarks of Engliſh travellers, which I have ſeen, ſeem not to extend beyond the city of Amſterdam.</p>
            <p>"THE beſt account of the Dutch manners I have met with, is contained in the <hi>Adele and Theodore</hi> of the counteſs <hi>de Genlis,</hi> who occaſionally paints the manners in ſome of their towns, particularly in Broeck, Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, &amp;c. in perfect conformity to your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions.</p>
            <p>"THE conſtitution of the United Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands has been attended to by writers on gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment; but an accurate account of trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els in that nation, deſcribing the face of the country, and the manners of the inhabitants, is, ſo far as my reading extends, as yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupplied in Engliſh, as well as American literature. I am of opinion that your eſſay will ſupply it, as far as can be expected
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:023039_0004_0FBB7450CE752C00"/>
from ſo ſhort a tour through the principal cities.</p>
            <p>"I AM pleaſed with your deſcriptions, your ſentiments, and your general manner of expreſſing them, and muſt thank you for the valuable information I have received from them, of the country and manners of the Dutch.</p>
            <p>"YOUR ſtyle may be criticiſed by illna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, ſcholaſtick pedants, but will not be blamed with any ſeverity by others. An eaſy, lively, familiar ſtyle, approaching even to careleſſneſs, is beſt ſuited to a work of this kind, and will give more pleaſure to read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in general, than the laborious ſtiffneſs and pedantry of <hi>Johnſon,</hi> or the florid ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of <hi>Gibbon.</hi> Let <hi>mere ſcholars</hi> pay more attention to words than things, and be praiſed by <hi>mere ſcholars,</hi> for their ſkill in arranging them like ſoldiers on the parade, and marching them off properly by diviſions—
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:023039_0005_0FBB7451B8B9D5D8"/>
This is not the chief buſineſs of thoſe who write to inſtruct, entertain and be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood.</p>
            <p>"IN many paſſages, which I have paſſed over, I ſhould have ſuggeſted ſome little al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration, if I could have had the pleaſure of ſeeing you. But as they would have requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a change of a ſentence, I could not alter them without changing the colour of the ſtyle, and often deſtroying its genuine <hi>naïveté.</hi> However, I think you may ſafely leave them as they are, for the ſmall criticks to nibble upon; for as <hi>they</hi> are the proper domeſticks in the literary family, it is but juſt that their maſters ſhould give them ſome crumbs for their ſubſiſtence."</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>XPERIENCE every day convinces me, that no ſituation in life is more diſguſting to an active mind, than to have noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to do.—The preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent moment ſeems a vacuum in my exiſtence; at night I look back with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023039_0007_0FBB9EB71E2E2688"/>
to find the beſt hours of my life mouldering away in the cauſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence.</p>
               <p>THE mind of man muſt reſt on ſome purſuit, or he will drift among the rocks of diſſipation.</p>
               <p>THE only hours in which I can rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh any ſatisfaction, are thoſe I paſs in the country; but my affairs often call me to this vaſt metropolis, which to me is the moſt ſoul ſinking place I ever was in; and, in truth, the laſt retreat for an American to enjoy that ſocial pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, neighbourly intercourſe, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial friendſhip, which conſtitute ſo large a proportion of our happineſs.</p>
               <p>EVERY family here are wrapt up with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves, and meaſure their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's merit by his purſe and equipage: In ſhort, the whole city is a great gulph
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:023039_0008_0FBB9EBD578DA1F0"/>
of riches and vice, and every particle of air ſeems impregnated with corruption: Indeed I find there is no happineſs equal to that which reſults from virtue, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and induſtry. The more I ſee of mankind, the more I am convinced of this truth, and the leſs reconciled to their vanities and follies. Do not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that I have been poſting about up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the globe for nearly ten years togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and am at laſt diveſted of thoſe liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ideas I have endeavoured to cheriſh— No! I have leiſurely traverſed old Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in almoſt every direction, and, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted of prejudice, I am ready to allow it the full weight of its merit: Take the kingdom all in all, I am perſuaded there is no country which has a better claim to deciſive bravery, and improvements in agriculture and the arts; but we have found the important myſtery of being much happier than the Engliſh, which may perhaps be imputed to a great
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:023039_0009_0FBB9EBE651BF060"/>
depravity of their morals, as it ſeems generally confeſſed that their former en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied national character no more exiſts, and that we now inherit in Neweng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land thoſe maſculine virtues which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed them ſo conſpicuouſly in the laſt century.</p>
               <p>HEAVEN defend our poſterity from the ſame degeneracy! If the conſequence is no leſs than the loſs of their happineſs, how much ought we to exert ourſelves to preſerve and perpetuate, our ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of manners, in their native pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity?</p>
               <p>I HAVE almoſt run through my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter without telling you the only thing I meant to ſay at firſt; which was, that I am juſt on the wing for Holland, without any view of buſineſs; but as I abſolutely begin to ruſt for want of activity, I mean to rub myſelf a little

bright among the Mynheers and Mav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. I have hunted over half the book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores in this city for ſome good deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that artificial country, but, to my aſtoniſhment, I cannot find any ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently accurate, either to furniſh juſt ideas, or to ſatisfy my curioſity—and as I know we have but little better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Holland in America, than of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taheite, I will endeavour to make ſuch remarks as will at leaſt impreſs the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects on my own mind, and perhaps a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe ſome of my American friends. Linked as we are in our political con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion with Holland, our ignorance on this head is much to be lamented.— Adieu!</p>

               <p>FIVE o'clock this morning left the King's Arms Inn, on my way to Harwich, with ſeveral jovial compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, bound to Holland.</p>
               <p>THE morning was ſerene, with a clear blue ſky, and the air ſweetly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumed.</p>
               <p>THE country from London to Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich is all in the county of Eſſex, and finely cultivated. We paſſed through ſeveral conſiderable villages, and by many elegant ſeats. Eſſex is celebrated for grain and cattle. We breakfaſted at Inger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtole,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023039_0012_0FBB9EC2F0FFA7C8"/>
twenty three miles from London, and paſſed the time ſo merrily to Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, fifty two miles, that we were hardly ſenſible of the ground or time we meaſured.</p>
               <p>COLCHESTER is a large town, built principally upon a pleaſant, healthy eminence, and celebrated for good oy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. The ſtreets are clean, and the houſes all white; but the pavements rough. Our landlord tells us, they count ſixteen pariſhes, and fourteen thouſand inhabitants, who carry on largely in the manufactory of flannels and baizes, known by the name of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter baizes.</p>
               <p>IN eight or nine miles from this town we arrived on the borders of the Stour, or tide river, and found the country exceedingly romantick and agreeable until we reached Harwich.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:023039_0013_0FBB9EC4844B6938"/>
In the neighbourhood of this place we paſſed the ſuperb ſeat of Richard Rigby, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> upon our right, and a ſeventy four gun ſhip on the ſtocks, on our left; immediately after which, from the ſummit of a hill, the German ocean ſuddenly opened to our view.</p>
               <p>HARWICH is a villanous dirty little hole, but the Packet being ready to weigh anchor, we were ſpeedily reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the impoſitions to which ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are ever ſubject in ſuch places.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>YOU will readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge my punctuality, when I aſſure you, that I arrived here but a few hours ſince, and have already aſſumed my pen to give you an account of a country I have hardly yet ſet foot into; but as the firſt impreſſion is always the moſt forcible, when one is plunged as it were into a new region of phizes and faſhions, where art and nature both aſſume a different aſpect, I ſhall endeavour to follow the current of my feelings from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we ſet ſail from Harwich, to the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023039_0015_0FBB9ECA35561550"/>
preſent; after which, you may expect a more detailed account, as I become more thoroughly acquainted; for I will freely confeſs my total ignorance both of the nation, and the geography of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. To paint the contraſt of objects in ſtrong colours admits of no delay, for once familiarized with them—the novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ceaſes. Before I proceed I muſt vent my ſpleen againſt the villanous ſearch officers at Harwich, who extorted money from each of us for doing what they are paid for. I contended in vain to oppoſe their injuſtice, but was reluctant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forced to bend to the rod, or ſubmit to delay and inconvenience. We weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anchor on board the Prince of Wales, Capt. Hearn, at ſeven o'clock in the evening, and ſtood along the Suffolk coaſt to the northward, to avoid ſome ſhoals, and then hauled E. S. E. I wiſhed much to remain on deck all the evening, but the atmoſphere was wild, and heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023039_0016_0FBB9ECDC7F57DA8"/>
charged with hanging clouds; which were ſo uncivil as to ſift their waters upon us, and oblige us to decamp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; where we immediately ſtowed our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves away in ſnug little cabins, which are particularly neat and commodious; indeed I have never ſeen any packet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ſo neat. We had a ſqually thundering night, but I was ſafe wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped up in the arms of ſleep until four o'clock this morning.—The morning's ſun ſoon frightened away the ſea exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which left to our view ſeveral veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels in the offing. Our veſſel had ſcarcely any motion, as the ſea was only dimpled by a light breeze, which wafted us gradually towards the Low Dutch coaſt in the afternoon; which we ſaw nothing off until cloſe aboard of it; owing to a miſt, and a flat country.</p>
               <p>WE ſailed along the Zealand coaſt upon our right, where windmills, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023039_0017_0FBB9ECEE361D898"/>
rows of trees, and diſtant ſpires were continually riſing to our view. The breeze quickened up, and puſhed us rapidly forward to the pier of Helvoet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſluys, where we doubled briſkly round, and in an inſtant entered between two long piers ſtretching out in the harbour, with the town directly before us. The piers were both lined with curious ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors.—The firſt object that fixed my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, was a ſmoking Dutchman, which marked the characteriſtick of the nation ſo far. In this moment I felt ſuch a ſpirit of univerſal philanthropy poſſeſs my ſoul, that I could moſt cordially have given him a friendly ſhake of brotherly love; this convinced me, how much our happineſs in this world depends on thoſe ſocial bonds which ought to link us all together.</p>
               <p>TO return—The pier is built of ſtrong piles of timber one hundred and forty
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:023039_0018_0FBB9ED0A29272D8"/>
feet in length, and ſunk thirty feet in the mud; an immenſe work indeed, which ſeems to bid defiance to the impetuoſity of the waves. We found ſeveral ſhips in the harbour, and the quay and ſtreets well paved with ſmall Dutch clinkers, or bricks, as hard as ſtone, and placed edge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. In the baſon above the town, we alſo ſaw ſeveral men of war, and ſome ſkeletons, ſaid to be the remains of the ſhips commanded by the famous Van Tromp, when he defeated the Engliſh. Helvoetſluys is ſituated upon the weſt ſide of the Iſle of Voorn in the Province of Holland. It is ſmall, but well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified, and neat in the extreme, as the clinkers are waſhed as clean as hounds teeth.</p>
               <p>IN truth, the houſes, dreſs, and every thing around us, wore the face of that neatneſs ſo peculiar to this ſingular na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and country. The ſudden change
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:023039_0019_0FBB9ED2FB452438"/>
of every object, had ſuch an effect on me, the firſt moment we entered this town, that I was almoſt inclined to imagine myſelf let off in an air balloon, or loſt in the moon, or ſome other region to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally new and ſtrange. We examined carefully every object worth notice, and and were much amuſed with the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of the houſes, many of which are built in the old Spaniſh manner; ſo that the attick ſtory is quite loſt in a narrow peek. The men and women in the vulgar claſs, are quite booriſh and inanimate, and appear characteriſtick with their ſhips—heavy and <hi>ſquare.</hi>—</p>
               <p>THE women are ſingularly dreſſed; we have not yet ſeen a ſingle head elevated beyond the bounds nature has preſcribed; but they are all truſſed up with caps as tight as their ſkins; add to this, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon braſs ear rings of an enormous ſize; and as a proof of their taſte, what
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023039_0020_0FBB9ED44C228D58"/>
ſhould you think of black beauty ſpots over their temples, as big as a crown, and as ragged as if torn from the ſilk?</p>
               <p>I AM quite in raptures with the neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which dazzles our eyes on all ſides; but as my head is not yet totally free from the dizzineſs of our ſea paſſage, I ſhall not venture any farther to night; but will reſerve my other obſervations for future letters, which you may regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly expect from poſt to poſt, until I have nothing new to ſay, or otherwiſe until my return to England.</p>
               <p>WE have now in company a young Oxonian, juſt <hi>fledged,</hi> and for the firſt time adrift in the wide world, upon the <hi>grand tour</hi>: I left him an hour ſince, induſtriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged in writing his journal in a back room, with his travelling deſk, and a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of inſtruments paraded before him— Were I a Dutchman, I ſhould have ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023039_0021_0FBB9ED602DAF8E8"/>
him for a ſpy, and ſtealing a plan of the fortifications: But how unjuſt my ſuſpicions would have been! for I peeped ſlyly over his ſhoulder, and found him innocently engaged in drawing a Dutch wench ſcrubbing the pavements—as the firſt ſpecimen of his genius and ſagacity— if father Sterne had been in my place he would certainly have ranked him in the claſs of "ſimple travellers."—It is a chance if your eyes are not fatigued by this time; I am ſure my fingers are, ſo I ſhall leave you abruptly, as I feel myſelf entirely diſpoſed to try the good qualities of a Dutch bed.</p>
               <p>MY compliments wait on your ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able family, and believe me very reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,</p>

                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I PROMISED to continue my obſervations, but ſo many new objects have crowded upon me ſince my laſt, that I am really at a loſs where to ſeize the chain, ſo as to run along from link to link, in ſome regular order to the end of the ſheet.</p>
               <p>WE left Helvoetſluys yeſterday morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at ſeven o'clock, in a villanous coach drawn by two horſes acroſs the Iſland of Voorn, to the pleaſant town of Brill, ſituated on the eaſt ſide of the Iſland.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023039_0023_0FBB9EDD9E0E07E0"/>
We found the roads muddy and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, and nothing which merits par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular notice in the country, except that their cows horns are ſhorter than thoſe in England—the ſheep have none at all —and if we can judge from the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the women, the huſbands are in no <hi>great danger</hi> of wearing horns any more than the ſheep—at leaſt not longer than the cows.</p>
               <p>WE obſerved upon almoſt every church, as well as in the very heart of the Brill, enormous great ſtorks neſts—theſe birds enjoy the patronage and protection of the States, we are told, from ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious prejudice—and from a notion that they are partial to Republicks. Swans are called imperial birds, as none but the nobility can keep them.</p>
               <p>SEVEN miles travelling brought us to the Brill; however, I will ſay nothing
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:023039_0024_0FBB9EDEAA645F08"/>
of this ſnug town, until I have told you how we were fleeced by the porters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſet off; and what is worſe, they are countenanced by the police: The truth is, we could not prevail on our lubberly, ſmoking mule of a driver, to bring his coach to our door to receive our baggage, though in the ſame ſtreet, and only half a dozen doors diſtant; but we muſt employ porters. After much puzzle about nothing, we put all our baggage into one waggon, and mounted ſix of us in another, and jogged away through the mud. It is very curious to ſee how theſe fellows ſteer their fore wheels with their feet. In approaching Brill, we paſſed under a double grove of beautiful trees, a long draw bridge, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over a wide foſſe; and then entered through the gates, and averſed the beſt part of the city; while the ſkippers were ſettling by the dice, which ſhould
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:023039_0025_0FBB9EE0279B30D0"/>
take us up to Rotterdam. This place is celebrated in hiſtory for giving birth to the Republick. It was here the male-contents planted their ſtandard under the Earl of March, in 1572, from on board ſome privateers (two hundred and three years before the Lexington battle, which alſo gave birth to the American Republick) and in ſpite of every effort made by the bloody Duke d'Alva, (who was then proſecuting the horrid inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with barbarous rigour) they held poſſeſſion. The ſparks of a revolt were thickly ſcattered, and only waited a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable breeze to blow up the flame, ſpreading in an inſtant throughout the ſeventeen Provinces, which were ſoon after ſupported by the great Prince Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam the firſt, at this time levying forces in Germany, to reſcue his country from the cruel hands of their biggoted, Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh perſecutors.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:023039_0026_0FBB9EE1ECDEDCB8"/>WE found every object upon a larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſcale at Brill, than at the Helvoet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſluys.</p>
               <p>LET a man have travelled in every oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er quarter of the globe, ſtill here he would have found the charm of novelty.—A certain whim and elegance mark their old houſes, which cannot be eaſily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, but muſt be ſeen, in order to be properly conceived of.</p>
               <p>THE ſtreets are ſpacious, and all plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with trees upon each ſide of the canals, which run along in the middle: The verdure of the trees reflecting ſtrongly upon large windows which are kept bright and free from duſt, add infinitely to their luſtre and magnificence.</p>
               <p>IT had an odd appearance to us, to ſee reflecting glaſſes hitched upon the outſide of the moſt genteel windows, ſo that Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:023039_0027_0FBB9EE5B668A278"/>
(Mavrow) can ſet unobſerved by her window and reconnoitre at her eaſe every object paſſing up and down the ſtreets.</p>
               <p>IN this town it ſeemed as if the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or chief buſineſs was ſcrubbing and ſcouring on all ſides. The church is a handſome ſtructure, the ſteeple of which is the ſailors land mark. Ships ſailing up the Maes to Rotterdam, paſs cloſe under the ramparts of this city, upon which are pleaſant walks under groves of trees.</p>
               <p>THE iſle of Voorn, of which Brill is the capital, is about twenty miles in length, and ſix in breadth; the ſoil ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to us light, but fruitful in grain.</p>
               <p>UPON our return, we found our veſſel ready to ſet ſail, and with a fine freſh gale at N. W. we immediately entered the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:023039_0028_0FBB9EE89D208718"/>
Maes, and ſtood away directly before it for Rotterdam.</p>
               <p>THE river is one mile and a half broad oppoſite to Brill; but in general a mile.</p>
               <p>UPON the borders, are many groves, as well as rows of trees, and ſeveral villag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; particularly Delfthaven, two miles from Rotterdam, and rendered famous for having produced the gallant Van Tromp—the pride of Holland; who, notwithſtanding his perſevering valour, never ſucceeded to any decided effect. This village is ſtrongly fortified, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended againſt inundations by dams. We ſaw three men of war, and ſeveral ſhips in the harbour as we paſſed. The willow trees along the margin of the river ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared afloat in the water at a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; indeed the country is ſo flat and low, that we had nothing in our way but trees to intercept our view, which we
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:023039_0029_0FBB9EEA3B409FF8"/>
overlooked moſtly from our deck. The meadows and paſture lands afford fine feeding for cattle, who ſtand up to their eyes in rich clover. The ſkip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per told us that the water is from four to five fathoms deep in many parts of the river; but no veſſel exceeding nine or ten feet attempts to come up the Maes by Brill, and that the heavy ſhips go round by Helvoetſluys and Dordrecht.</p>
               <p>IN the neighbourhood of Rotterdam, we paſſed ſeveral groves of trees upon our right; and then ſailed along parallel with the bomb quay, half a mile, where we ſaw a lovely line of trees cloſely knit together, which <hi>half</hi> deprived us of the ſight of the moſt magnificent houſes I can recollect to have ſeen any where. The old ſkipper told us, that the walks under theſe trees were truly elegant, and much frequented by the <hi>beau
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:023039_0030_0FBB9EEB93311600"/>
monde</hi>—we found them broad, with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct walks finely ſhaded.</p>
               <p>WE penetrated with our eyes into the heart of this beautiful city, through two or three avenues as we paſſed; which ſhewed us ſuch a ſingular confuſion of maſts, ſpires, trees, canals, and houſes, all jumbled together, as led me almoſt to think that nature and art had planned this enchanting compound in a whimſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal moment.</p>
               <p>ROTTERDAM is the ſecond grand em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porium of the Republick—the harbour is ſafe from naval enemies, but inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient of acceſs, on account of its diſtance from the ſea.</p>
               <p>THE port is rendered particularly commodious, by large canals, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſhips of upwards of three hundred
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:023039_0031_0FBB9EECFB15D6D8"/>
tons burden, quite up to the merchants doors in every part of the city.</p>
               <p>OPPOSITE to the bomb quay the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of the ſhipping are moored, which has a noble effect, much enlivened by the motion of ſhips and boats ſailing up and down the river.</p>
               <p>THE town is very populous, and built in a triangular form; the houſes moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly very large and elegant, made of flat ground brick, neatly pointed with white ſeams—and the ſtreets are ſpacious and well paved by the ſides of the canals.</p>
               <p>TO avoid a repetition on this head, I will endeavour to give you a general idea at once of the principal cities in Holland. Imagine yourſelf traverſing one of theſe cities, and every other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon a neat draw bridge (built with hewn ſtone and iron railings) lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:023039_0032_0FBB9EEE81885968"/>
over a canal running through a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtreet, with a continual commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of boats and barges upon each ſide —a clean paved wide ſtreet before you, and beautiful houſes, with trees border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the canals. Hold faſt to theſe grand outlines, and ſuppoſe yourſelf immerged in a crowd of induſtrious mortals, all in purſuit of wealth, and you can eaſily trace, by your fire ſide, moſt of the towns in the Seven Provinces.</p>
               <p>I MUST not forget to tell you, that we walked in a pleaſant grove juſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the gates, where we ſaw many of the gentry upon the wing for their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſeats, with good black horſes, and clumſy carriages—ſome of them capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly made in form of triumphant cars —The Dutch gentlemen ſeldom ride on horſeback, and never without being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the ridicule of the rabble at ſuch an uncommon ſight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:023039_0033_0FBB9EEFE8B98D68"/>WE were often puzzled in the ſtreets for an interpreter, but ſeldom failed in addreſſing ourſelves in French to any people of genteel appearance. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally aſtoniſhing how generally this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is now ſpoken throughout Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. Indeed it is almoſt vulgar for a man to ſpeak his native tongue with the <hi>beau monde</hi>—and a knowledge of the French is an indiſpenſable criterion of an accompliſhed gentleman; for a foreigner is always addreſſed in this popular and charming language.</p>
               <p>SINCE I am upon the ſubject of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, a few words in defence of the Dutch will not be improper. Every one knows it is in truth vulgar and harſh; but perhaps no two languages bear a greater affinity to each other than the Dutch and the Engliſh.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:023039_0034_0FBB9EF1A63CB628"/>WHEN I firſt arrived in France, it was ſome weeks before I could underſtand a collected French phraſe; but the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I landed in Holland, I heard entire Engliſh phraſes, or rather ſuch as the Engliſh borrowed from the Dutch; for it is well known, that the Dutch is an original language, and the Engliſh, on the contrary, a compounded one; beſides, in examining a Dutch letter, I found it contained ſo many Engliſh words and phraſes, that I had no difficulty to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the greateſt part of it. It therefore ill becomes the Engliſh to rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icule a language ſo much like their own.</p>
               <p>WE ſaw near the market place the ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue of the famous Eraſmus, who was born here; and viewed St. Lawrence, the principal Church—where we aſcended a lofty tower, from whence we command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a delightful pictureſque <hi>coup d'oeil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="unknown:023039_0035_0FBB9EF53784EBD0"/>THE city of Rotterdam appeared like a high finiſhed curious picture below us; and the country beyond, a delightful back ground, cultivated like a continued garden, all the way to our horizon.</p>
               <p>I HAVE not yet, in any inſtance, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced a more happy hour than in contemplating this wonderful country, which ſeems like an enchanted fairy land.</p>
               <p>IN ranging over this extended proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, we encompaſſed within our view, through ſpyglaſſes, Delft, Dort, Hague, Brill, Utrecht, and Amſterdam; which in fact included the beſt part of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               <p>I THOUGHT it beyond the power of the moſt fertile conception to imagine a more lovely ſight; but I found this large picture much improved by reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:023039_0036_0FBB9EF89AEFB4C8"/>
it to miniature by a concave mirror, which we luckily had with us.</p>
               <p>THIS country never fails to ſtrike even Europeans (acquainted with high cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) with wonder and admiration; but the effect is yet more powerful upon an American, who has been accuſtomed from his infancy to a country of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, laid out upon a large and copious ſcale: This, on the contrary, is a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of art, as it were, wreſted from the ſea, which neceſſarily produces as great a contraſt in objects as can be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
               <p>I AM terrified with the length of this letter: Should it afford you any amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment adequate to the poſtage and troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le in reading it, my wiſhes will be fully gratified.—Adieu!</p>

                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>ALL nature ſeems to ſmile this delightful morn.</p>
               <p>WE have juſt made a little excurſion into the country, roving careleſsly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the yellow boſomed meadows, the fragrancy of which was a luxury I wiſh to participate in common with my friends.</p>
               <p>WE ſhall go on glutting our greedy eyes until the afternoon, when we intend purſuing our travels on to the Hague.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="unknown:023039_0038_0FBB9EFB32178838"/>I MUST not, however, leave Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam without making my obeiſance to our thirteen American ſtripes, which are flying among the ſhipping. You know I am particularly partial to them. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their youth, they are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in introducing themſelves into the company of old European ſtreamers, which have been waving on the ocean until they begin to fade with age: But the <hi>Stripes</hi> ſhine with the luſtre of a rainbow, after a thunder ſtorm—which, happily for mankind, is blown over— and has left the world in a dead calm.</p>
               <p>IN addition to the American ſhips in this harbour, we ſaw ſeveral large Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, freighted to carry over to America upwards of one thouſand emigrants.</p>
               <p>WHAT a feaſt for the ſoul, when we reflect that the preſent age in America has, by a virtuous and arduous ſtruggle,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:023039_0039_0FBB9EFCCB2F1920"/>
opened an aſylum to the oppreſſed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth: This conſideration alone (when we reflect on its extended effects, and probable duration) is worth all the dangers and toils we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured in the conflict.</p>
               <p>SINCE the world firſt exiſted, no peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ever had a more ſolemn, and import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant charge committed to their hands; as the welfare of millions, for ages to come, reſts on the perſevering virtue of the preſent generation.</p>
               <p>AMERICA ſtands comparatively like the ſun in the heavens—the centre of light, and the wonder of the admiring world, who feel the influence of its rays.</p>
               <p>THE perſecuted will find eaſe and reſt; and tortured virtue and exiled worth will take refuge among us, from every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this old world.</p>
               <p>

               <p>I PRAY God, that this infant fabrick may never be ſhattered by the claſhing intereſts of the different States; and that they may continue their glorious career, and nobly ſacrifice partial views to the general good of the common empire.</p>
               <p>THERE is ſomething ſo exceedingly muſical in the Dutch chimes, that I oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſtop in the middle of a ſtreet to liſten to their ſhrill ſounds: The bells hang, in great numbers, in niches round the towers of the churches.</p>
               <p>IN the church of St. Lawrence we ſaw a grave, where bones, and ſome old Dutch ſkulls were ſticking out at the ſides, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently eager once more to catch the light: The old Sexton was buſily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:023039_0041_0FBB9F051446D390"/>
in collecting the bones, and pack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them up in ſeparate boxes, of about three feet ſquare, to be reinterred in this compact way, which I find is a cuſtom.</p>
               <p>OUR Oxonian companion took off a curious Latin Epitaph from a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of which he gave me this tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Engliſh:</p>
               <p>JOHN BRAAKEL, THE TERROUR OF THE SEA, TO WHOM FIRE, EARTH, AND WATER SUBMITTED, IS COVERED WITH THIS STONE. HIS SPIRIT EVEN NOW SEEMS READY TO BURST INTO FLAME, AND TO BREAK FROM ITS EARTHLY HABITATION, AS HE BROKE THE CHAINS OF IRON.</p>
               <p>I WAS much pleaſed with theſe bold thoughts; and upon examining the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:023039_0042_0FBB9F0661701AB8"/>
of the United Provinces, I find Braa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kel was a Dutch Admiral from Haerlem, who diſtinguiſhed himſelf in a memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exploit in the holy war, in 1245.</p>
               <p>WHEN the combined armies arrived in Egypt, the paſſage of the Nile was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by an extraordinary iron chain, which Braakel found means to break, by the aid of enormous iron ſaws fixed on the ſtern of three of his ſhips; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention ſucceeded, and Damietta was in conſequence taken: The idea was ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted by a Haerlem boy, ſince which the city arms are, a ſword between four ſtars, and a croſs over the point, with this motto: "VALOUR OVERCOMES POWER."</p>
               <p>AS an American, I feel myſelf deeply impreſſed with the ſuperior dignity of my country. Not from its preſent wealth or
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:023039_0043_0FBB9F07E67E2810"/>
numbers, nor from thoſe ſelfiſh and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row principles which lead moſt Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to view themſelves and their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſuperior to the reſt of the world; but from the happy ſituation of America— its natural advantages—and indulging in the copious field of anticipation.</p>
               <p>IN February, 1778, I found myſelf in the ſouth part of Georgia, and the trees in full bloom, with every pleaſing aſpect of ſpring.</p>
               <p>FROM February to May, I continued edging northerly as far as the borders of Newhampſhire, carrying with me for upwards of 1200 miles the ſame climate and fragrancy.</p>
               <p>IN this tour, I croſſed eighteen noble rivers, and travelled over every ſpecies of ſoil, bleſſed with ſuch a diverſity of cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:023039_0044_0FBB9F0962A35328"/>
as to render it ſuſceptible of all the productions the earth affords.</p>
               <p>ENGLAND, France, and many other parts of Europe, after a ſucceſſion of ages, for ſome thouſand years, have at length arrived to the higheſt ſtage of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements both in agriculture and the arts: Two centuries however have hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly elapſed ſince America was a mere haunt for ſavages, and for animals; and yet we find her already advanced to the intermediate ſtage between a ſtate of wild nature and the improved ſtate of Europe.</p>
               <p>HOLLAND is a perfect garden; but a continued ſameneſs preſents no new ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for the imagination to reſt upon.</p>
               <p>ENGLAND and France are more diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſified and romantick, and in general richly cultivated—here and there an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial foreſt—venerable caſtles—majeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick

country ſeats—large populous in land cities—charming roads; and many other intereſting objects, to engage the partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular attention of an American: But when we leave theſe objects, the effects of art, and enter upon the broad ſcale of nature, we ſhall find her in miniature on this ſide of the Atlantick, in compariſon to the vaſt lakes and rivers, bold har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, majeſtick trees, and mountains of America, where the face of the country is pleaſingly chequered with high culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and nature in its bold and orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal ſtate.</p>
               <p>VIEWING America from its firſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery to the preſent period, and then carrying our ideas forward one hundred years, we may ſafely preſume upon as many millions of inhabitants, all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances conſidered; with wealth and improvements in proportion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="unknown:023039_0046_0FBB9F10264E2AE8"/>SINCE no reaſon therefore can be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned why America will not continue its career with the ſame wonderful progreſs for the next hundred years, an Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican may juſtly glory in his country, without falling under the imputation of national prejudice.</p>

                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>HERE we go! in a floating houſe ſixty feet long and ſix wide.</p>
               <p>I AM now ſeated in what is called the roof or cabin, which is very agreeable, being calculated to hold conveniently eight or ten perſons, who can ſecure it to themſelves by paying a ſmall matter extra. This cabin has a table in the middle, two ſaſh windows, and a bench with velvet cuſhions on each ſide.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="unknown:023039_0049_0FBB9F14A8CD5BB8"/>THE reſt of the boat is covered with a flat roof, ſtrewed over with ſmall ſhells cemented in tar, upon which paſſengers may walk with perfect ſafety: Under the platform, or roof, the common paſſengers are ſeated; twenty eight is the full com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, as ſtipulated by the police.</p>
               <p>I HAVE juſt been upon deck, and wiſh now to introduce you into our compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny by as conciſe a deſcription of the country, and manner of travelling, as my pen will allow me to give you.</p>
               <p>IN the firſt place, we jumped on board juſt without the gates of Rotterdam, and were then put in motion, by a ſingle horſe, trotting along upon the edge of the canal, with thirty of us in tow. In this manner they travel three miles an hour. In this progreſs they are ſo exact, that the Dutch manner of computing diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from place to place, is by hours in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of miles.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="unknown:023039_0050_0FBB9F165757F3C0"/>LOTH to loſe a ſingle object, we parad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the top of the houſe, with a crowded room under us, and clouds of tobacco ſmoke iſſuing out from little win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows on each ſide—with a full view of the country all around—being entirely flat and no obſtacle to impede the ſight. In this manner we are now travelling:— But I am ſure you will not forgive me to leave you on the top of the boat, and ſay nothing of the country, and a pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing variety beſides.</p>
               <p>ON one ſide of the canal, near Rotter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, we paſſed a pleaſant row of trees, alive with carriages and people, as well as the canal with theſe cloudy boats full of paſſengers, and loaded lighters.</p>
               <p>YOU will naturally ſuppoſe that ſuch a perpetual movement, with a chain of draw bridges, leading over the canals, muſt neceſſarily produce confuſion.—
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:023039_0051_0FBB9F18F10B05F0"/>
                  <hi>Point du tout!</hi> You would be ſurpriſed to ſee with what dexterity, they avoid each other, and paſs under the bridges. All boats going one way are obliged to drop the rope by which they are dragged until the others paſs. Thus the progreſs of neither is retarded.</p>
               <p>THE ſeaſon is all in our favour, and nature in full dreſs. The weather as fine as we could wiſh, and our proſpect on all ſides animated by a charming variety.</p>
               <p>YOU muſt know that moſt of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel people reſide the beſt part of the ſummer at their country houſes; many of which are ſuperb to a high degree; the others are very neat, and all ſituated near the borders of ſome canal, with a little pleaſant ſummer houſe exactly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the margin. Theſe houſes are in a manner <hi>all windows,</hi> and many <hi>á la Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſe</hi>—the gardens are mere pictures—
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:023039_0052_0FBB9F1AE58B63A0"/>
the Dutch however ſeem too much at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to a profuſion of evergreens, and box; many of their pleaſure houſes are covered with them, and we often ſee them formed into grottos, arches, and a variety of pleaſing and whimſical forms.</p>
               <p>THE fragrancy of the meadows and flower gardens, heightens exceedingly this agreeable manner of travelling in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in a fine ſummer's day, which we now enjoy; and from the top of our floating houſe we have a fair peep into their pleaſure houſes; where we ſee the happy citizens, regaling themſelves in parties, drinking tea, ſmoking, playing cards, hearing muſick, or reading occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally. I almoſt envied them their happineſs; but have got myſelf between two fires, and muſt leave you until we paſs Delft, or elſe I ſhall be ſuffocated under a heavy cloud—two old Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are puffing up at my elbows.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:023039_0053_0FBB9F1D786BAA20"/>IT is very ſingular I cannot ſuffer a pipe on water; but on <hi>terra firma</hi> I can range myſelf comfortably in a battalion of ſmokers.—Adieu! for a moment.</p>
               <p>P. S. WE are now drawing faſt to the city of Delft—my next will be from the Hague.—Adieu! again.</p>

                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I AM now to give you an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of occurrences ſince I left you in a tobacco cloud, on the Delft canal.</p>
               <p>I AM always fond of mixing with peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in every ſituation, when I am trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elling; otherwiſe we might as well ſtay at home. The only true way to ſtudy the human paſſions, and the grand ſpring which actuates the bulk of mankind, is to analyze them in various poſitions; and by a diſpoſition to be affable, every one may eaſily induce a converſation:—
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:023039_0055_0FBB9F20A8677D98"/>
If he gain nothing by the bargain, it is his own fault if he loſe.</p>
               <p>IN this frame of mind, I crawled into the body of the boat, and fortunately filled a vacant ſeat by the ſide of a <hi>belle Bruxellois tout á faite à la François,</hi> with her Monſieur upon her left.—I found no difficulty to introduce a <hi>badinage</hi> the firſt moment I was ſeated; and in the next, with all the wanton aſſurance of a Newenglandman, to aſk her, from whence ſhe came? where ſhe reſided? and if the gentleman by her ſide was her huſband, gallant, or brother? She, with all the good nature of a true Frenchwoman, as readily gratified my curioſity. By the time we drew near Delft, our acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was refined into the true ſtyle of <hi>ſans ſouce,</hi> and it ſeemed to me as if it was of a month's ſtanding at leaſt—how, or by what ſingular agency it happened, I know not; but our hands were ſoon locked in
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:023039_0056_0FBB9F23128E07D0"/>
one—and I began to conceit that I felt myſelf ſenſibly intereſted in her happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>HER huſband was buſily engaged in reading, and gave himſelf no anxiety about us.—Cuſtom has in France eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed a certain <hi>innocent</hi> ladies' language —which in England would be conſtrued into a decided intrigue.</p>
               <p>IN leaving the trukſchute at Delft, Monſieur politely reſigned up Madame to my care, and trudged on before— We linked arms, and trod over the pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as lightly as a young couple on the full march to the ſhrine of Hymen— Every moment in this criſis of our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching ſeparation, mutually intereſted us in each other's welfare—and while we were walking the ſtreets of Delft, Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ame ſlipt her addreſs at Rotterdam into my hand—where I pledged myſelf to
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:023039_0057_0FBB9F247AF381C8"/>
pay her my reſpects on my return from Amſterdam.—By this time we came up to the houſe of her deſtination—and I thought I could read more meaning in her brilliant black eyes in the final adieu! than in all ſhe had ſaid—thus we part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. She made a transfer of her polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Monſieur; with him I rejoined my comrades, and then viewed every thing of note in this large city.</p>
               <p>DELFT is a pleaſant and elegant place, ſituated thirty one miles ſouth weſt from Amſterdam, in the province of Holland, containing about five thouſand houſes and twenty thouſand inhabitants. It is of an oblong figure, and well defended from enemies and the ſea, by an old wall and three dams. The inhabitants are principally people who have retired upon their fortunes. The ſtreets are conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently exceedingly neat, and free from the noiſe and buſtle of trade.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="unknown:023039_0058_0FBB9F278EBF3CF0"/>THE ſtadthouſe is a handſome old Gothick ſtructure, in which are many good paintings; but the one that moſt merits attention, is that which repreſents the aſſaſſination of William I, prince of Orange, which is affectingly tragick, and finely executed. We next viſited the old palace, where this great man reſided at the time of this fatal cataſtrophe, which was perpetrated by Balthaſar Gerard, who was firſt inſtigated by a monk, in conſequence of a bounty the brutality of Philip II led him to offer in a publick edict for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>THEY ſhewed us the ſpot where he fell at the foot of the ſtairs, and two holes which the balls made in the wall after having gone through the prince's head. On the wall is a Dutch inſcription.</p>
               <p>THE aſſaſſin deſired to ſpeak with the prince in private, juſt as he roſe from
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:023039_0059_0FBB9F2A29B35AA0"/>
table, and plunged himſelf into a ditch, after having executed his bloody deſign; but was immediately taken, and rolled naked in a caſk, driven full of ſharp nails, until he expired.</p>
               <p>THE old and new churches are capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal buildings; each adorned with lofty ſteeples, and uncommonly harmonious chimes, which quite delighted us as we were entering the latter, a ſtupendous pile, where the aſhes of the immortal prince of Orange, already mentioned, reſt in peace. In contemplating this magnifick tomb, I cannot expreſs what I felt in recollecting the ſeries of hard and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous ſtruggles in which he contended, to ſtem againſt the perſevering barbarity of the duke of Alva. Recapitulating in my mind the variety of his conflicts— his fatal end—and the ſtriking ſimilarity of his and our great <hi>Waſhington</hi>'s charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, my enthuſiaſm betrayed me into an
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:023039_0060_0FBB9F2B2946D560"/>
involuntary ſigh of homage, accompanied by a tear, which I detected ſtealing ſlyly down my cheek. Indeed their fame, and the importance of their atchievements are ſuch, in the ſcale of human events, that their names deſerve to be written by the rays of the ſun on the ſurface of the HEAVENS.</p>
               <p>THE prince's ſtatue in marble, lies upon the top of the tomb, with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite dog at his feet, who, according to tradition, died with grief, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after his maſter.</p>
               <p>THE tomb lies under the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heaven, which is ſupported by twenty two black marble columns, upon the top of which ſtands Fame with her trumpet ſounding over him, and this motto—<hi>"te vindico tutor libertas."</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the ſtatue on the tomb, there is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:023039_0061_0FBB9F2D62B92518"/>
in braſs, full length, and many other ornaments in braſs and marble.</p>
               <p>THE ſucceeding princes of Orange are all interred in this church.</p>
               <p>IN the old church we ſaw the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the admirals Peter Heine, Van Tromp, and the famous Luwenhock the phyſician. The arſenal, we are told, is the largeſt in the republick, and worthy a traveller's inſpection—but our time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied us the pleaſure of ſeeing it.</p>
               <p>DELFT is celebrated for its earthen ware, and formerly ſucceeded in a fine imitation of porcelain, which are both on the decline.</p>
               <p>THE ſtreets are very broad, two of which are a mile in extent, and the fronts of many houſes are paved with black and white marble.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="unknown:023039_0062_0FBB9F2EF272C3B0"/>THE ringing of the ſeven o'clock bell hurried us on board of our trukſchute, upon a full canter through the ſtreets; where we ſecured the roof all to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; but did not arrive in this ſuperb city until late in the evening, which was ſerene; but the thick exhalations from the canal prevented the moon from ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us the country: Her pale beams quivered lightly upon the water, but too dimly to enable us to diſtinguiſh objects; however, the lights from the ſummer houſes compenſated in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
               <p>THE dampneſs of the evening air, ſo pernicious in Holland, obliged us to box up in our cabin; but we ſaw the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try near the canal from our cabin win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, as we paſſed.</p>
               <p>WE had a merry evening, but the ſtench of the canal was intolerable as
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:023039_0063_0FBB9F3070E10FC0"/>
we approached the Hague, which not a little ſurpriſed us.</p>
               <p>WE were puzzled in the ſtreets to find our hôtel, but were ſoon relieved by a genius watching his opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for new comers; he threw out his bait, which my unguarded fellow trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellers (who were green in the ways of the world) eagerly catched at—but as my experience in the broad world had taught me their manoeuvres, I only ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him to ſhew us the ſtreet, and then, with the beſt grace in my power, wiſhed him a <hi>decided</hi> good night.</p>
               <p>WE took lodgings at l' hôtel of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh parliament, an excellent houſe, where they ſpeak French and Engliſh, and have the beſt attendance.</p>
               <p>A PROPOS, I omitted to mention to you, that the great and wiſe Grotius was
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:023039_0064_0FBB9F3442B227B0"/>
buried in the new church, near the prince; this unfortunate man fell a vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim to the raſh reſentment of prince Maurice, ſucceſſor to his father Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam I.</p>

               <p>IT will be preſumptuous in me to attempt a deſcription of this moſt beautiful city, till I have fairly ſeen and examined it: For I find the objects are ſo important, and the place, in every reſpect, ſo much beyond my conceptions, that I ſhall be obliged to devote ſeveral pages to this ſubject alone; but I will endeavour to be as conciſe as poſſible.— Indeed my letters are of ſuch horrid lengths, that I will try to haſh up my cookery of deſcription in future in a more laconick journal ſtyle, which is
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:023039_0066_0FBB9F38A7A4A6B0"/>
leſs formal, and often more intereſting and familiar than a ſtiff epiſtolary one.</p>
               <div type="days_events">
                  <head>Sunday, <hi>June</hi> 4.</head>
                  <p>I TOOK care to appear in print, eſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ially as my firſt ſtep was to pay my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to the American ambaſſador, John Adams, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> but his abſence turned my attention to the churches, it being then the height of their devotion.</p>
                  <p>THE Dutch churches I have ſeen are all diveſted of thoſe gaudy ornaments, ſo common in France and other catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick countries: On the contrary, they have a certain melancholy gloom, owing to the walls being covered with the arms of the principal families, worked upon black velvet, and bordered with broad black frames. Theſe give the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or at leaſt an idea, of the inſide of large tombs. The Dutch prieſts were
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:023039_0067_0FBB9F3A32045A10"/>
thumping the cuſhions to large and crowded audiences, who ſtood all with their hats on.</p>
                  <p>FROM the churches I repaired to the grand parade, where the garriſon of the Hague was reviewed by the prince of Orange, the two young princes, and a great concourſe of nobility and citizens.</p>
                  <p>THE troops are bold ſtout fellows, dreſſed in blue faced with red. I ſqueez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in cloſe to the prince, and had a fair chance to contemplate—the man—with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being governed by appearances, which are indeed much againſt him. He is of a middling ſtature, effeminate, with a diſagreeable ſtooping gait; add to which a ſtupid and inanimate countenance.</p>
                  <p>AFTER ſaying thus much of the prince, can I venture to obſerve to an Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that we were five in company, and
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:023039_0068_0FBB9F3D40BBED60"/>
were all ſtruck equally with an idea, that there is a ſtrong family reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the prince and the king of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, who you know are related by the marriage of the princeſs Anne, daughter to George II, and mother to the prince?</p>
                  <p>FROM parade we ſtrolled through the principal ſquares, and many other parts of this ſuperb and truly elegant city, which delighted us extremely. Though the magnificent buildings on the bomb quay at Rotterdam far excelled any oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers I had then ſeen in Europe—yet the Hague eclipſes and muſt exceed, the moſt brilliant imagination. It is generally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be the moſt elegant city in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope—perhaps in the world.</p>
                  <p>AT two o'clock I returned again to the grand hôtel belonging to the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen United States of America, lately purchaſed by Mr. Adams, for the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:023039_0069_0FBB9F3FF41EBA48"/>
of our future ambaſſadors. It is decently furniſhed, has a large library, and an elegant little garden. I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the moſt cordial manner, din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ambaſſador, and in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon we took an airing in his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, through the beſt part of the city, and then to the pleaſant fiſhing town of Schewling, two miles from the Hague, upon the borders of the ſea. The weath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er being fine, the road and ſide walks were full of people, all puſhing forward, on foot and in carriages, to enjoy the ſea breeze, and walk on the beach.</p>
                  <p>THE novelty, and the roaring of the uncouth cook maids, with which the waggons were crowded, exceedingly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſed me; but their ſinging, or rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er yelling, was comparatively like the ſqualling of as many cats, roaſting over a roaring fire: They ſeemed to vie with each other which ſhould make the moſt
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:023039_0070_0FBB9F41A16E3270"/>
noiſe, but without the leaſt harmony or uniſon;—their mouths were frightful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtended—and their faces ready to burſt with their efforts—which, added to their ſingular dreſs, produced a laughable ſcene.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>THIS ſcene brought to my mind a very abſurd and awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward cuſtom, prevalent in America; though on the other extreme. In France every one finds himſelf perfectly at eaſe with all around him the firſt moment he enters a circle; and converſation is as animated, and as unreſtrained in a full company, as among a few ſelect friends. In England and America, the reverſe is the caſe—let a Frenchman be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into a large circle at their firſt meeting—he muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf dropped into a ſociety of Quakers. Every one ſeems at firſt afraid to break ſilence, for fear of the criticiſms of the reſt—by degrees however the charm is diſſolved, and it is ten to one if another foreigner ſhould be uſhered in, four hours from the firſt, that he would ſuppoſe himſelf in Bedlam; this extraordinary reverſe comes on progreſſively.</p>
                        <p>AS ſoon as the company begin to find themſelves at eaſe with one another, and their frozen tongues a little unbent; ſhould a young lady be in the circle, ſome gentleman, or perhaps the lady of the houſe, will call on her to ſing—ſhe directly declares "ſhe never ſung in her life," though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps half the company have been entertained with her ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before—as this ſubterfuge therefore will not avail her, the whole company fall upon her like hungry dogs upon their prey—then ſhe proteſts—"ſhe has a bad cold"—all mouths are again opened—ſing! ſing! you muſt ſing!—thus hunted down, after a ſew—hems—and ſtill perſiſting in her bad cold—the fair ſyren opens her harmonious throat, and quivers out perhaps a good ſong, or perhaps ſomething like the Dutch waggon girls—as it may happen!—and, at any rate, ſhe calls her veracity ſeriouſly in queſtion in face of the whole company.</p>
                        <p>HAVING reſided and travelled ſeveral years in moſt parts of France, I will freely confeſs myſelf ſtrongly prepoſſeſſed in favour of their general cuſtoms, and I ardently hope we ſhall rub in our American compoſition a ſeaſoning of the French—<hi>ſant ſouci</hi> and <hi>vive la bagatelle.</hi> They undoubtedly are the happieſt people in Europe, owing to a charming cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, light diet, good wines, vivacity, and living under a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potick government; which though unfriendly to liberty, and that noble expanſion of the human ſoul—yet it has a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to check ambition; they glide oh with eaſy gales in their paſſage through life, if bleſſed with a good monarch, and a bad one is their greateſt danger.—One half of the unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mankind ariſes from ambition; and as happineſs is the main end of this life, that government which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the largeſt ſhare, is, in my humble eſtimation, the beſt,</p>

                     <pb n="74" facs="unknown:023039_0071_0FBB9F4359D5D888"/>THE ambaſſador's livery is the ſame as the American uniform, which is known by all ranks of people, who pay ſo much reſpect to it, that a few more jaunts to Schewling would have put me under the neceſſity of buying a new hat.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="75" facs="unknown:023039_0072_0FBB9F44AE236E90"/>THE road is charming, and entirely ſhaded by a double row of trees, ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly lined that we ſaw the ſteeple of the village church from the gates of the city, through an arch formed by the limbs of the trees.</p>
                  <p>THE north ſea opened to our view all at once, at the end of the avenue. Nature has kindly provided a barrier againſt the ocean, by the downs which are thrown up along the principal part of the coaſt of this low country; which I alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved on the coaſt of the Auſtrian Neth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erlands, in travelling through that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try a few years paſt. But they owe their principal ſecurity to the dykes and dams.</p>
                  <p>I AM told there was in this village, a kind of waggon conſtructed by prince Maurice's principal engineer, which they ſay would go upon the ſand along the
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:023039_0073_0FBB9F4624C0B8D0"/>
coaſt at the rate of ſeven leagues an hour, by help of fails.</p>
                  <p>PEOPLE often bathe here in the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; but what is very ſingular, I am aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that the fiſhermen's daughters, not only guard the men's clothes, but wipe them dry with towels as they leave the water; and this with perfect <hi>ſang froid</hi>; which plainly proves how far cuſtom and habit may reconcile us to any thing.</p>
                  <p>THE coaſt was full of ſmall fiſhing veſſels. Some we ſaw at ſea.</p>
                  <p>THE count de Bentinck's famous gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens are upon this road, and are well worth ſeeing. They belonged former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the duke of Portland, who was particularly patronized by William III. They are diſtinguiſhed from all other gardens in the province, by their ſtyle, ſimplicity, and pictureſque views; ſuch
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:023039_0074_0FBB9F47A11E5908"/>
as a fine orangery, a grotto, water ſpouts, a foreſt, terrace walks, hills, flower gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, a lake, and a menage; in ſhort, the eye is on every ſide delighted.</p>
                  <p>ON our return we paſſed the prince, walking, with a numerous retinue.— Spent the evening with Mr. Adams, and the famous Monſieur Dumas, his ſecretary, who eminently diſtinguiſhed himſelf in the early part of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt, at the court of France, as well as by gaining us weighty friends in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick.</p>
                  <p>WITH two gentlemen of ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened genius and deep erudition, it would have been my own fault not to have ſifted out every information I was ſo eager to obtain relative to this country, and the preſent convulſed ſtate of its complicated government.— I have taken my notes and ſhall touch

                  <p>BREAKFASTED with Mr. Adams—af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which we viſited <hi>la Maiſon du Bois,</hi> which is ſituated about a mile from the Hague, in the centre of the largeſt nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural wood in Holland, and the only one, except the wood near Haerlem.</p>
                  <p>THIS palace was built by the widow of prince Henry Frederick, for a houſe of mourning. It is an elegant ſtructure and entirely ſequeſtered from the gay world, being in a manner emboſomed in a grove, cut into many romantick walks leading from the palace, which has a large garden behind it. Over the gate we ſaw the arms of Orange Naſſau, and entered by a flight of ſteps.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="unknown:023039_0076_0FBB9F4EDC2A9240"/>THE grand ſaloon, with its exquiſite paintings, are the principal objects of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and moſtly executed by thoſe great maſters, Rubens and Van der Worf, repreſenting in very large pieces, the brilliant triumphs of Frederick Henry, who finiſhed the fabrick of independence for his country, which was founded by his immortal father, and vigorouſly car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by his gallant brother Prince Maurice.</p>
                  <p>AS I was born with a tincture of a painter's ſoul, I found in this ſaloon, a luxurious feaſt for the eyes. The widow Amelia in her weeds, is repreſented in the middle of the ceiling of the cupola over the gallery, where the muſicians former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly played, to ſooth her melancholy.</p>
                  <p>RUBENS' <hi>Vulcan in his ſhop,</hi> placed very properly near the fire, is eſteemed the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the collection: But what pleaſed
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:023039_0077_0FBB9F4FE3E5D990"/>
me moſt, was the full length portraits of William I, and Prince Maurice; who are alſo repreſented in buſts of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble placed over the chimney.</p>
                  <p>THE floors are black walnut, covered with rich carpets. In one of the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments we ſaw a valuable India japanned railing, encloſing the princeſs's bed; which is inlaid with the mother of pearl, and coſt twenty eight thouſand guilders. In another apartment was ſhewn us a flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er piece, the work of a Flemiſh maſter, and valued at fifteen thouſand florins. I was ſo enraptured with the paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that after a full hour's eager ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, I left them with regret.</p>
                  <p>MR. Adams then diſcharged his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and we walked two hours more about the foreſt, which was very pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me, notwithſtanding the road were heavy and ſandy. The lofty oak
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:023039_0078_0FBB9F516DE43AE0"/>
ſeemed to be ſo promiſcuouſly thrown together, that it revived in my breaſt a lively picture of many ſuch ſituations I had ſeen in the courſe of my tour through the United States of America, ſome years ſince. Our eyes were delighted with the fine plumage of the birds, whoſe ſweet melody reechoed through the woods.</p>
                  <p>DINED at the American hôtel; and in the afternoon we made an excurſion to the neat village of Ryſwick, ſituated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Hague and Delft, two miles from the former. The road is well paved, and beautifully adorned by lofty trees and fine meadows on each ſide. This village is famous for the peace concluded here in 1697.</p>
                  <p>THE palace is ſituated about a quarter of a mile from the village. It belongs to the prince of Orange, and is nobly built with hewn ſtone; but going faſt
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:023039_0079_0FBB9F52E9538378"/>
to ruin. The aſſembly chamber is cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated for the echo of a whiſper from the oppoſite walls, the ſame as the whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering gallery at St. Paul's in London. It is decorated with a marble ſtair caſe, marble floors, fine gardens, and a good terrace.</p>
                  <p>SPENT the afternoon in viewing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent places, which will come under a general deſcription of the Hague. The evening I paſſed with Mr. A—, who introduced me to the Dutch ambaſſador (on the point of going to the court of London) the famous author Dr. Mc Lane, and ſeveral other gentry who came to make their viſits.</p>
               </div>
               <div type="days_events">
                  <head>TUESDAY NIGHT, 12 o'clock.</head>
                  <p>I AM amply provided with letters of introduction from Mr. A— and Monſ. Dumas, for Leyden and Amſterdam;
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:023039_0080_0FBB9F55205F6638"/>
and intend leaving this charming place in the morning, on my way thither: But I muſt now ſum up all I have to ſay about the Hague in as few words as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>I SPENT this forenoon in rambling at large in this city; dined again with Mr. A—, and in the afternoon we took an airing to Delft. We paſſed through ſeveral barriers, rode a circumference round the ramparts of that city, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in the evening along the edge of the canal. But I muſt not omit to tell you that if I had not exerted myſelf, I ſhould probably have witneſſed the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant ſcene of one of the moſt brilliant characters of the age (Mr. A——) ſcram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in a muddy canal, his wig afloat upon the ſurface, and all from a laudable zeal to ſave a child then drowning; the moment he ſaw the ſtruggling infant bobbing on the top, I thought he would
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:023039_0081_0FBB9F5A84E6FD58"/>
have darted headforemoſt into the canal, regardleſs of his perſonal ſafety: But I reſtrained his impetuoſity for a moment, as a luſty fellow had that inſtant ſouſed himſelf in.</p>
                  <p>IN popularity and influence at this court, Mr. A— undoubtedly bears the palm in the diplomatick body. He is univerſally eſteemed, for his profound penetration and extenſive political knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, the firſt character our weſtern world has yet produced.</p>
                  <p>HE talks but little—thinks a great deal —and what he ſays is always to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and in point of future events, his words ſeem to be the words of an oracle. He may indeed be conſidered as a veteran in politicks, having long acted a conſpic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous and important part, and acquired vaſt experience at ſeveral of the courts of Europe, in a very ſerious criſis.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="85" facs="unknown:023039_0082_0FBB9F5C01294D60"/>THOUGH he does not ape the graces of a Cheſterfield, yet we have found in him the more important accompliſhments of an ambaſſador; for his ſtern republican virtues, have in every inſtance roſe ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour to the duplicity and affected con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of European courtiers. Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica ſtands indebted to him principally for three important acquiſitions—The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat of Sir Joſeph Yorke, and ſecuring the patronage of Holland, in a critical moment—the extenſion of our limits— and the ſecurity of our fiſheries. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing completely accompliſhed every object of his ambition relative to America, it appears probable that this country may yet be indebted to his active genius, as an inſtrument in producing ſome reforms in the ſyſtem of their heavy moulded and convulſed government.</p>
                  <p>HAGUE is ſituated only two miles from the ſea, and nine S. W. from Leyden:
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:023039_0083_0FBB9F5D6CE9E108"/>
And notwithſtanding it is termed a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage (becauſe it is not walled and ſends no deputies to the States) yet it enjoys other advantages, ſufficient to rank it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the firſt cities of Europe, both for opulence and beauty.</p>
                  <p>LORD Cheſterfield declares it to be the moſt elegant city in the world.</p>
                  <p>IT contains ſix thouſand houſes and forty five thouſand inhabitants, ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a canal bordered by lofty trees. It is the ſeat of their government, and the reſidence of all foreign miniſters, which together draw ſuch a concourſe as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes principally to the ſupport of the inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>THE ſituation is eſteemed healthy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat elevated, and in the heart of a fruitful country, ſurrounded by wall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cities, villages, beautiful country
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:023039_0084_0FBB9F5F0FB20548"/>
houſes, magnificent gardens, and charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meadows. Many of the ſtreets are finely ſhaded, and in general ſpacious. The houſes are for the moſt part built with hewn ſtone, and of the firſt rate, both in ſize and elegance.</p>
                  <p>THE ſquares are numerous, and all planted with large trees. The inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants are a model of the Pariſians; very polite, and entirely <hi>a la François</hi>; ſeldom ſpeaking their native language, and much addicted to gambling. The ladies of the <hi>beau monde</hi> are fond of gallantry and diſſipation, and are in general very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. The palace of the prince of Y—g is eſteemed the fineſt building at the Hague; and thoſe of the princes G—t and V—ſt, are all compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively like as many palaces; they are fronted by a handſome grove, and a canal.</p>
                  <p>THE prince G—t's has a noble effect. It is half a mile long, very broad, with a
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:023039_0085_0FBB9F618E2E5348"/>
canal paſſing through it, and finely ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with trees, and a number of ſtone bridges (with iron railings) croſſing it.</p>
                  <p>THE Vyverburg is alſo fronted by the moſt elegant houſes on one ſide; oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to which are ſtately trees, with a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious baſon of water faced with hewn ſtone between, and a romantick little iſland in its centre, full of trees. Near this is a very large grove of trees, with a railed mall in the middle. The moſt material building is the court, ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated nearly in the centre of the town, where the Stadtholder reſides.</p>
                  <p>THE council of ſtate, the council of nobility, the courts of juſtice, and in ſhort all publick buſineſs, centres here. It is ſurrounded by a foſſe, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trances into it are by three draw bridges, where the guards are ſtationed ready to raiſe them in caſe of a riot; this does
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:023039_0086_0FBB9F62A3AB6C88"/>
not ſeem altogether an eligible ſituation for the free debates of a republican aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, eternally jealous of their ſtadt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder; nor entirely <hi>conſiſtent,</hi> as men are often under influence from their lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal poſitions.</p>
                  <p>THIS palace is very old, which, in my eſtimation, makes more in favour of its exteriors than any particular elegance it may be thought to poſſeſs.</p>
                  <p>THE great ſaloon is in the antique ſtyle, and full of the trophies of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries gained over their enemies.</p>
                  <p>THE chamber of the ſtates general is hung on one ſide with rich tapeſtry, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namented with the portraits of ſix ſtadt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders: On the other ſome excellent pieces, and all at full length. The cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber where the twelve years truce was ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled, between Spain and Holland, in 1609,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:023039_0087_0FBB9F64219171E0"/>
is alſo ornamented with the ſame por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits, and the republick repreſented over the chimney, under the figure of a woman —the room is very luminous and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looks the Vyver.</p>
                  <p>THE council chamber contains a ſtring of paintings, repreſenting the actions of Claudius Civilius, by Holbein, for which lord Bolingbroke offered 10,000l. ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. This Claudius, was a Batavian by birth, and held a principal command in the Roman army, but proved a traitor in the end, and, like our infamous Arnold, was afterwards their moſt implacable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy.</p>

                  <head>WEDNESDAY, <hi>June</hi> 7.</head>
                  <p>THIS morning at nine o'clock, I left the Hague, on my way to Leyden. We had a ſtrong gale againſt us, which did not however ſenſibly check our progreſs.</p>
                  <p>WE were about three hours perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this trip. The canal, the whole way was very ſpacious (ſay about fifty feet wide) and the water above the level of the country, which added much to the advantage of our proſpect; which was in every reſpect equal in feats, ſummer houſes, and the face of the country, to that already deſcribed between Rotterdam and Delft: But from the continual paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:023039_0090_0FBB9F6E0B080D08"/>
of trukſchutes, and not underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the abrupt orders of our ſkipper, I was frequently in danger, on the top of the boat, of getting my legs tripped up by the rope; but this may be eaſily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided, by keeping below, which my ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger curioſity would by no means liſten to.</p>
                  <p>I formed an acquaintance with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible inhabitant of Leyden, who, on our approach to the city, ſhewed me the ground from whence the Spaniards un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der general Baldſez beſieged this place; as alſo the veſtiges of one of their old forts.</p>
                  <p>I COULD not contemplate the horrors of this cruel ſix months ſiege, without a heart felt ſympathy; eſpecially when I recollected the tragick picture given of it in Watſon's Phillip.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="unknown:023039_0091_0FBB9F6F9BB4F4E0"/>HE ſays—"When the Spaniards en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to intimidate them into a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of the town, they nobly anſwered —'that they had maturely weighed their ſituation, and were reſolved to periſh, with their wives and children, in the flames of the city, kindled by their own hands, or die with hunger, rather than ſubmit to the Spaniards'—the miſery which only exiſted in imagination, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the two firſt months of the ſiege, was at laſt fatally realized as they were reduced to the hard neceſſity of eating their dogs and horſes."</p>
                  <p>LEYDEN is ſituated ſix miles from the ſea, and nineteen ſouth of Amſterdam.</p>
                  <p>IN point of ſize, it yields only to Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, and is as neat and pleaſant as any town in the republick. It is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to contain forty thouſand ſouls,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:023039_0092_0FBB9F70EF8FC800"/>
which is indeed a ſmall number in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to its ſize.</p>
                  <p>THE city is well fortified, with a wide ditch, adorned with rows of trees; the buildings are beautiful, and the ſtreets in general very ſpacious, and perfectly clean and white, particularly broad ſtreet, which runs quite through the city, from the Hague gate to the Utrecht gate: This ſtreet riſes in the middle, and is finely paved. The others have in general a canal in the middle, adorned as uſual, with ſtately trees, ſome three rows on a ſide, which give them the appearance of ſo many alleys of a beautiful garden.</p>
                  <p>THE city is built on the old Rhine, which divides it into fifty iſlands, of which thirty one may be ſailed round in boats. It has one hundred and forty five bridges (built of ſtone) with iron railings, one hundred and eighty ſtreets, and forty two towers on the walls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="unknown:023039_0093_0FBB9F7368BA0E50"/>THE ſtadthouſe is an old long ſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, built in 1597, in the true Dutch ſtyle. The building has nothing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable to claim a traveller's notice; but there are however ſome fine paintings in the grand chamber—particularly a large one repreſenting the citizens of Leyden, when relieved from the horrid ſiege (already mentioned) by boats com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their relief over an artificial ſea. The beſt painting is a whimſical repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the day of judgment, by the famous Luke Leyden, who is ſaid to be the firſt modern painter who had true ideas of perſpective: This painting is certainly the production of the moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile imagination; but with what juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he has delineated the confuſion of this important and awful day, remains yet to be decided.—He died in 1533.</p>
                  <p>THE largeſt church, is a vaſt pile, but in other reſpects, merits no other partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:023039_0094_0FBB9F75A8AB54C8"/>
notice, than to pay the tribute of homage due to the manes of that great phyſician and philoſopher, Boerhaave, who enlightened the world with the flame of his genius; his monument is admired for its elegant ſimplicity.</p>
                  <p>THE reputation of this great man ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended into China: A mandarin wrote to him with this inſcription—<hi>"To</hi> BOER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>HAAVE <hi>in Europe</hi>;"—and the letter came regularly to him.</p>
                  <p>THE city of Leyden have raiſed a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ument in the church of St. Peter to the ſalutary genius of Boerhaave, <hi>"Salutife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro Boerhaave genio ſacrum."</hi> It conſiſts of an urn upon a pedeſtal of black marble; ſix heads, four of which repreſent the four ages of life, and two, the ſciences in which Boerhaave excelled, form a group iſſuing between the urn and its ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The capital of the baſis is decorat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a drapery of white marble, in
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:023039_0095_0FBB9F77D3EC5398"/>
which the artiſt has ſhewn the different em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems of diſorders and their remedies. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove upon the ſurface of the pedeſtal is the medallion of Boerhaave; at the extrem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the frame a ribbon diſplays the favourite motto of this learned man, <hi>Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex ſigillum veri.</hi>—truth unarrayed. Boer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haave quitted the ſtage of an active and uſeful life in 1738, aged ſixty nine years.</p>
                  <p>WE ſaw an old caſtle in the middle of the town, called the Burg, which was, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to tradition, built in the ninth century; it is ſix hundred and ten feet in circumference, and we aſcended the top by fifty ſteps; from whence we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a complete and charming view of the city, the adjacent meadows, downs, and the Haerlem ſea. Within the Burg there is a well of great depth, in which (according to the hiſtory of the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſiege under Baldſez) the inhabitants caught a large fiſh, which they ſhewed
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:023039_0096_0FBB9F79242D4AA0"/>
in triumph from the walls to the enraged Spaniards. They pretend alſo that there is a communication from the bottom of this well under ground to Catwyk.</p>
                  <p>THE univerſity is highly worthy at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. It was founded in 1575, by the ſtates, in gratitude for their brave defence, and is the principal of the five which are in the United Provinces, viz. Leyden, Utrecht, Franeker (in Frieſland) Groningen and Harderwicke. The build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is old and awkward; but the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors have been the moſt eminent in Europe, ſuch as Liprices, Scaliger, Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marius, Heinſius, and the renowned Boerhaave.</p>
                  <p>THE botanical garden, with its ſtat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues, the cabinet of natural curioſities, the library, anatomy, petrefactions, and foſſils, are very fine, and well attended. In the phyſical garden we ſaw the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:023039_0097_0FBB9F7AA27E75A8"/>
aloe, which bloſſoms only once a century, green and bohea tea, coffee, and a vaſt variety of what I am very inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to ſay much about, curiouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played. Among the natural curioſities I was ſhewn many wonderful phenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na in nature.</p>
                  <p>THE library is only open to men of letters twice a week. This univerſity enjoys many great privileges, even to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict death; but the profeſſors are ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to the court of Holland.</p>
                  <p>THE manufactures of this place were formerly very extenſive, particularly in blue and black ſuperfine broad cloths, which they had the ſecret of dying to greater perfection than any other nation (as the French now have the ſcarlet;) but they have declined very much of late years: They manufacture alſo narrow cloths and camblets.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="101" facs="unknown:023039_0098_0FBB9F7FE4B36A90"/>THERE are many fine ſeats in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity of Leyden which ſtrangers viſit out of curioſity. Their butter is excellent.</p>
                  <p>DINED at the Lion d'Or. Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly after dinner I ſallied forth alone, which is not always the beſt method of acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knowledge in a ſtrange country—as one is obliged to depend on very precari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous information.—But it is attended with ſome advantages, as one is at leiſure to make obſervations on the general man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the people unreſtrained—eſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ially their treatment of ſtrangers. I went into a dozen ſhops; ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood me in French; but with thoſe who did not ſpeak French I had like to have unhinged my under jaw in labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—without bringing forth ſix words of their language. I conceited myſelf looking like one of their tobacco head ſigns, with my mouth horridly diſtorted.—They are indeed civil, but have not that pleaſing
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:023039_0099_0FBB74576B9B6808"/>
anxiety to help out a ſtranger, ſo pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the French women, who hold a foreigner kindly by the button of his coat, and in a manner hammer words into his brain, with their fore finger preſſing gently upon his ſleeve.</p>
                  <p>I REMARKED in this Don Quixote excurſion, that the common claſs of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (ſuch as ſhopkeepers, &amp;c.) are very ſerious—their ſenſibility keen—they are eaſy to bluſh—they cannot ſupport a joke or compliment—the firſt their jeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſy conſtrues into an inſult—the laſt confuſes them: They laugh with pain, and never without cauſe—and when the laugh of the company falls on one pair of ſhoulders, their ſenſibility is always ſtabbed to the quick, and proclaimed openly to the whole company by meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers flying from the heart and every irritable part of the body, burſting into a blaze upon their cheeks. Such being the
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:023039_0100_0FBB7453373558B8"/>
effect of a joke in Holland, ſurely every generous mind will wave this reſource of amuſing company, and wiſely meaſure his conduct in all countries, by the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and prevailing cuſtoms of its inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants; who are always governed by ſome general caprice, peculiar to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>I FELL in fortunately with the deacon of the preſbyterian church, who ſpoke French perfectly: The moment he found I was an American, the muſcles of his face and the expreſſion of his eye plainly declared his partiality for my country; he left his affairs, and I found him very intelligent; to his information, with what I collected from Monſ. Luzac, I am prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally indebted for the account I have already given of Leyden.</p>
                  <p>I FORGOT to mention that this church is the identical one, where the original Browniſts worſhipped, previouſly to form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:023039_0101_0FBB74586E930CC8"/>
their firſt eſtabliſhment in Plymouth, Newengland, in 1620. The building is very old and inelegant; but I viewed it with more abſtracted ſatisfaction than a palace. The deacon aſſured me that Mr. A— could not refrain from tears, in contemplating this ancient ſtructure; a veneration and homage due to the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous founders of Newengland, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of this great man.</p>
                  <p>SUPPED with Monſ. Luzac, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous lawyer, to whom I had letters. I was charmed with his converſation, and found him ready to anſwer me any queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in any language; but as I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to two, we converſed in them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently.</p>
                  <p>THIS gentleman is celebrated through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Europe for his uncommon talents and extenſive knowledge; and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly for his patriotiſm, and being the

editor of the Leyden Gazette, which is univerſally eſteemed the beſt in circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>AT eleven o'clock I returned home to my lodgings, along the ſides of the canals by the light of a dim moon; but what was very ſingular in ſo large a city, all was as quiet and huſh as in the open country, and not a ſoul ſtirring—owing to the decline of population. Monſ. Luzac ſays they formerly eſtimated ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enty thouſand inhabitants.</p>

                  <p>AT nine o'clock this pleaſant morning we were moving through another fine canal, ſeemingly like going on the road to Paradiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="106" facs="unknown:023039_0103_0FBB9C6195A69A40"/>I POSSESSED the roof with a naval of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer (of capital connexions, if I can credit <hi>his aſſertion</hi>;) among other circumſtances, he mentioned, a ſingular method of duel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Holland, among the vulgar, with ſhort knives. The contending parties are happily confined to the face, which they defend with as much dexterity with their ſhort knives, as Frenchmen do their bodies with long ſwords; but they owe their ſafety more to a ſingular knack of throwing back their bodies.</p>
                  <p>WHILE we were exchanging trukſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chutes on our way—the men and women were all <hi>piſs ants promiſcuouſly en concert</hi>— which I find they can do with as good a <hi>grace</hi>—as Sterne's Madame <hi>Ramboulet</hi> at Paris.</p>
                  <p>WE traverſed over a pleaſant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try between the downs of Haerlem lake on our right, and the downs which run
<pb n="107"
                         facs="unknown:023039_0104_0FBB9C62AA0D0B90"
                         rendition="simple:additions"/>
along parallel with the ocean on our left. Within a few miles of Haerlem the country aſſumes a new aſpect, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all ſweetly diverſified, in a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chain of beautiful and elegant ſeats; a large foreſt, and a variety of delightful views.</p>
                  <p>IT was in this foreſt, that the celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Laurenſz Janſez Koſter, alderman of Haerlem, firſt ſuggeſted the invention of printing with types, in 1440. He was rambling careleſsly alone, and amuſing himſelf in cutting out letters in pieces of wood; with which he made ſome impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which led to the types: And it is to this fortunate chance that mankind owe the facility of communicating their ideas. John Fauſt, a ſervant of the Alderman's, ſtole off the types to Mentz, where he pretended to conjuration, and aſſumed to himſelf the merit of the diſcovery. This is the ſame Doctor Fauſtus ſo much
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:023039_0105_0FBB9C66B0A65498"/>
known among the vulgar in America for his league with the devil, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>IMMEDIATELY after dinner we went to ſee the firſt eſſays Koſter made with his wooden types, which are to be ſeen in the type manufactory oppoſite to the old ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral. His ſtatue, with an elegant Latin inſcription, is in the town houſe. The world ſtand indebted to the late in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious Baſkerville of Birmingham, in England, for the moſt elegant improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the art of printing. We exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined the proceſs of making types, which is very curious and expeditious.</p>
                  <p>From hence we viewed the old cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral, where we ſaw the firſt organ in the world, made at Haerlem by the ingenious Mullar, in 1738. It is a ſtupendous piece of grandeur and ingenuity, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eight thouſand pipes, the largeſt of which are ſixteen inches diameter, and
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:023039_0106_0FBB9C69CAA82258"/>
thirty eight feet long. It has ſixty eight ſtops, and imitates moſt admirably, the human voice, ſolus, or in chorus; differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent kinds of birds, trumpets, flutes, fifes, and a kettle drum. They play the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan two days in the week, for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement of ſtrangers and the citizens; but, if by particular deſire, it will coſt a ducat to the organiſt and a gratuity to the blower.</p>
                  <p>There are two ſilver bells upon the church, which were taken by the famous Admiral Braakel (whoſe tomb I ſaw at Rotterdam) at <hi>Damietta</hi> in Egypt; as alſo three ſmall ſhips ſuſpended in the church, with ſaws on their ſterns, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting the cutting of the chain of the Nile already mentioned.</p>
                  <p>WE were ſhewn in this church bullets ſticking in the ſides of the walls, which were fired by the Spaniards during the
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:023039_0107_0FBB9C6AEA274E38"/>
terrible ſiege they ſuſtained in 1572, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the duke of Alva's ſon, count Frederick.</p>
                  <p>THE city was gallantly defended by four thouſand men, who were heroically ſupported by the women; but at length famine obliged them to yield; when two thouſand people were the inſtant victims of Spaniſh fury, contrary to the expreſs terms of capitulation.</p>
                  <p>HAERLEM lies about four miles from the ſea, has eight gates, is built of brick, and the ſtreets reſemble thoſe of Leyden. By an exact eſtimation, made about fifty years ago, this city contained ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand nine hundred and ſixty three houſes, and fifty thouſand people; at preſent the numbers do no exceed forty thouſand.</p>
                  <p>THEIR trade is chiefly with Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, and principally in linen, ribbons,
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:023039_0108_0FBB9C6E88E2B820"/>
ſome guazes, and tapes, of which they weave fifty pieces at a time by the aid of mills.</p>
                  <p>ITS ſituation, lying contiguous to Haerlem lake, and the peculiar ſlimy qualities of its water being more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to bleaching than any other, gives them a ſuperiour advantage in the white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their linen.</p>
                  <p>THE Iriſh formerly ſent vaſt quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of linen to be bleached here annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</p>
                  <p>THE meadows all around the country are as white as our American fields after a ſnow ſtorm.</p>
                  <p>THE ſtadthouſe is a large building; where we ſaw ſeveral fine paintings in the prince's appartment, particularly that which repreſents the golden age.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="112" facs="unknown:023039_0109_0FBB9C7026DA22F0"/>LATE in the afternoon, we left Haer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem and embarked for Amſterdam upon an elevated canal, running in a direct line, with a row of trees and ſtone poſts upon our right. About half way we exchanged boats, and traverſed acroſs a little cauſeway which divides Haerlem lake upon our right, from the river Y upon our left, which falls by Amſterdam into the Zuder ſea. This lake is four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen miles over each way, and was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an inundation about three centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries paſt, which buried ſeventy two towns and villages in its progreſs, and afforded a perfect repreſentation of the flood in miniature—every living creature, and all the effects in the country, floating pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuouſly—ſome on the tops of the houſes—others hanging to the limbs of trees, &amp;c. &amp;c. This famous lake would be only ranked as a pond in America, where nature forms every thing upon a broad ſcale—here it is thought more of,
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:023039_0110_0FBB9C71A5D96078"/>
than we think of our lake Superiour, which is capable of receiving three ſuch republicks upon its area.</p>
                  <p>FROM the top of the cauſeway we had a full view both of the lake and river; as well as the ſtately palace of Zwanen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg, where the directors of the dykes and canals aſſemble.</p>
                  <p>THE canal led in a ſtraight line from the cauſeway to Amſterdam, which we ſaw moſt of the way before us: But the variety we ſo juſtly expected to meet near the metropolis was by no means ſo pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as in entering Haerlem—indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of a ſtrong ſtench riſing from the ſtagnated canal water.</p>
                  <p>I TRAVERSED over the beſt part of Amſterdam before I came to my lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, viz. at the firſt bible in the Hier Graght. I find the beſt inns dignify

               <p>AS my only object in this country is to ſee the ways of the world, and to graſp at every uſeful or amuſing information that comes within my reach; ſo I ſhall go in my looſe Journal ſtyle until I ſee you.</p>

                  <head>SATURDAY.</head>
                  <p>I EMPLOYED the whole day in taking a curſory view of this extenſive metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis of the Seven Provinces; as well as the
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:023039_0113_0FBB9C7CC45D8208"/>
harbour, and a foreſt of ſhipping, which do not appear ſo numerous as upon the Thames. Viewed the docks, and ſaw ſeveral new men of war of ſeventy four guns, and ſeveral old ones, which they convey in and out of their artificial docks, and quite to the Texel, by the aid of camels; a curious invention, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives their hulls within its body.</p>
                  <p>WE next viewed a clergyman's cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inet of natural curioſities—a great, and bigoted antiquarian: The collection was indeed extremely curious; but he dwelt on the latent merits of every object with ſo much ardour that we were glad to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect our retreat after ſome difficulty.</p>
                  <p>FROM thence, chance directed me into the Jews' ſynagogue; here I remained a full hour; and as it was the firſt time I was ever in a ſynagogue of a Saturday evening, I was much pleaſed with this
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:023039_0114_0FBB9C7DA29C61D0"/>
ſingular novelty—as well as the angelick ſhrill notes of a beautiful young lad, accompanied with thoſe of an old fellow, (well known in the muſical world by the name of Leonar) who was piping with his hollow, grum belly, a moſt admirable baſſo—indeed I could hardly perſuade myſelf I was not deceived by a fine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, until a near approach to the altar convinced me the muſick was vocal.</p>
                  <p>AS the ſun verged towards the horizon, the voices, and agitation of the whole congregation, increaſed to ſuch vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, and gave them ſuch frightful looks, that I was almoſt apprehenſive they were falling into ſtrong convulſions. Stunned with their bellowing, I was glad to retreat to the open air, not only for the ſafety of my head—but pockets—for in fact they looked, for the moſt part, like ſhabby theives and pickpockets.</p>

                  <head>MONDAY.</head>
                  <p>VIEWED the ſtadthouſe thoroughly, a deſcription of which will come with Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam. We ſaw from the top, the Zuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſea, Haerlem lake, and this vaſt city, and a cloud of ſhipping below us; though the proſpect encompaſſed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable range of country, and a rich feaſt for contemplation, yet it does not equal the proſpect from St. Laurence's church in Rotterdam.</p>
                  <p>THE chime on the ſtadthouſe is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be the fineſt in Europe; we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined

it throughout—an immenſe work indeed—we waited on the roof until it played; it is ſo contrived like an organ, that a man can play upon it with the ſame eaſe.</p>
                  <p>WE were ſhewn all the curioſities in this celebrated building, and were charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the paintings; in particular the one by Vandyke, which repreſents the duke of Alva, in conference with the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geoiſe of Amſterdam, before they abjured the Spaniſh yoke; this painting ſtrongly repreſents that dark and bloody charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he afterwards exhibited to the world; at the ſame time a bold and martial aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
                  <p>AT two o'clock I went upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change and delivered my ſeveral letters of introduction from Mr. A—. This exchange is longer than London, but not ſo large, nor will it hold a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon

either with that of London, or Rot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam, in neatneſs or elegance, being built with brick, and diveſted of orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. At full change it was complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly crowded. As I had nothing more than curioſity to engage my attention, I retired into one corner, to contemplate the ſcene; which led me to compare this exchange to a glaſs beehive I ſaw at the famous Wildman's at the foot of High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate hill, which was to all intents Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam change in miniature. The buz was the ſame—the eagerneſs of the bees crowding into the hive; and their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and ardour to collect the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey—was all the ſame—but it would be rather illiberal to carry the idea ſo far, as to ſuppoſe them all a ſet of inſects, in general actuated by noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beyond the ideas of a bee, who trips from flower to flower, and roams abroad in the wide world, to ſuck in the ſweets of every plant, with no other

view than to lay in a winter's ſtock for <hi>his dear ſelf</hi>— which <hi>in conſcience</hi> is the main ſpring that moves us ſons of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, particularly in large cities: But happily for mankind, there are many no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble exceptions.</p>
                  <p>SPENT the evening at the French the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre, which is a ſmall thatched houſe like a barn; the actors however were good; there were few genteel people at the play, which is very extraordinary in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis, eſpecially as this is their only ſummer's amuſement, in this line. The Dutch play houſe for winter amuſements is much more elegant.</p>

               <div type="days_events">
                  <head>TUESDAY.</head>
                  <p>CROSSED the river Y, or Wye, in a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed company of Germans, Americans, and Engliſh; and landed at Sardan, ſix miles from, and nearly oppoſite to, Amſterdam.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="122" facs="unknown:023039_0119_0FBB9C8A64160598"/>WE paſſed through the ſhipping in the harbour, and then had a complete view of the river, and a foreſt of maſts, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged with much order.</p>
                  <p>IN approaching Sardan a battalion of windmills ſeemed to be drawn up in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray in our front. This extraordinary town appeared to us rather ſmall, previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to our landing; but words are too feeble to expreſs my ſurpriſe at the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, as well as the ſingularity and diſpoſition of the houſes, gardens, and almoſt every object in a ſtyle different from any I have yet ſeen.</p>
                  <p>SARDAN is ſituated in Northholland and contains near forty thouſand wealthy inhabitants; ſome ſay it is the richeſt town in Holland. They have acquired this wealth principally by the wood trade, ſhip building, and a variety of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious mills for different purpoſes, partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ularly
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:023039_0120_0FBB9C8C1DF83DC0"/>
paper, powder, tobacco, boards, &amp;c. &amp;c. They ſhewed us a ſawmill which works forty ſaws at a time.</p>
                  <p>THEY have ſo much timber always prepared on hand that they can do as much work as the building of a man of war in a week, by having three months previous notice. In general they build three hundred ſail of merchantmen yearly.</p>
                  <p>AFTER rambling through this charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and very curious place for ſome hours, we were conducted to a ſmall houſe, in which Peter the great boarded with the common workmen, at the time he learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſhip carpenter's trade <hi>incog.</hi> and was the moſt faithful and laborious man in the yard. He afterwards worked at Chatham docks in England.</p>
                  <p>THE woman of the houſe ſhewed us a gold medal lately preſented her by the
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:023039_0121_0FBB9C9223E10348"/>
empreſs of Ruſſia. This ſingular whim of Peter (who was one of the greateſt ſovereigns Europe was ever bleſſed with) prepared him for the great fatigues he afterwards endured in contending with Charles XII, of Sweden, and civilizing his extenſive dominions.</p>
                  <p>THIS place is a perfect Chineſe pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the buildings are rather ſmall, but moſt whimſically beautiful; and for the moſt part painted in various colours, and the roofs are of glazed tiles: They have in front handſome parterres; and gardens behind, ſo finely diſpoſed, as to exceed all belief.</p>
                  <p>THE town covers over a large ſpace of ground, the canals are very long, with a chain of theſe enchanting houſes ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a line by their ſides.</p>
                  <p>THE genius and cuſtoms of the North-Hollanders are different from the other
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:023039_0122_0FBB9C93664AD758"/>
provinces, and many are very ſingular; for inſtance—they puſh their exceſs of neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſuch extremes that the maſters of houſes, are poſitively obliged by cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom to pull off their ſhoes at their <hi>own doors,</hi> where a ſervant ſtands ready with a pair of ſlippers. Again, the front doors are never opened but in caſes of death and marriage. The women are ſtrangely metamorphoſed, and differently dreſſed from the Southholland laſſes: Their heads are bound up with broad gold, or braſs ridges, running acroſs their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, they have light caps, their hair out ſhort before—prodigious large earrings, and broad flat hats, cocked up in the air, made of calico; which have a ſingular effect: But under all theſe diſadvantages, I ſaw many beautiful faces, but vile ſhapes; the girls look ſo much alike that one would be almoſt led to think they were all ſiſters.</p>

                  <head>WEDNESDAY.</head>
                  <p>WE took a waggon for Bruck, ſix miles diſtant, which in many reſpects exceeds Sardan, and is allowed by travellers to be the very model and pink of neatneſs, for all Holland; and without exception, it might be drawn as the moſt perfect picture of any city or town in the world.</p>
                  <p>IT is chiefly inhabited by commercial veterans, who have retired from Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, immerſed in wealth. They carry on largely in the banking and inſuring line. Neither horſes or carriages, are ſuffered in the ſtreets of this fairy village, which are finely paved with different coloured ſtones, fancifully worked in various rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſentations, and ſtrewed lightly over with ſand, with as much care as the inſide of their houſes; which are very curious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and every thing we ſaw glittered
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:023039_0124_0FBB9C9A04591D08"/>
ſo ſtrongly with neatneſs, that our eyes were fairly weakened with gazing.</p>
                  <p>THE preliminary article previous to a courtſhip, in Northholland, is very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, but generally obſerved. The miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable lover ſtands making under his miſtreſs's window, two or three hours every night, for three months ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively: If he holds out the ſiege firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the end of this time, he is then admitted to her preſence, upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended ties of matrimony—but never before: She indeed at times, deigns to ſolace his trembling doubts, with a word of comfort. An intelligent Engliſh gentleman, reſiding in Holland, whom we met in the ſtreets of Sardan, ſays this cuſtom prevails only in Northholland, and originated from the Spaniards, who reſided among them before the revolution. Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens! what a contraſt between this and our bundling cuſtom in Newengland?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="128" facs="unknown:023039_0125_0FBB9C9AF0FDC750"/>THEY are remarkably coy of ſtrangers, and always marry among themſelves; in conſequence, the originality of their cuſtoms are preſerved free from contam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ination.</p>
                  <p>LATE in the afternoon returned to Sardan, and embarked immediately for Amſterdam, with upwards of one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of us, crowded in, male and female, under the hatches: Soon after we left the ſhore, we were ſuddenly attacked by a thunder ſquall and heavy rain, ſo that our ſkipper was obliged to ſhut the hatches, which gave us all the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection, and opened a wide field for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment.</p>
                  <p>MY ſituation was ſo odd—wedged up between two Dutch laſſes—in the dark —and ſtanding all like ſheep in a pen— as muſt have excited the mirth of the moſt phlegmatick Engliſhman. I felt
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:023039_0126_0FBB9C9C629CA050"/>
the full force of my ſituation, and it put me in a fine flow of ſpirits. In ſpite of the danger of diſlocating my under jaw, I gagged out, by <hi>main force,</hi> a few Dutch words I had ſtolen, but ſo highly ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned with Engliſh and French, that I could hardly make myſelf underſtood: However, as I always feel myſelf diſpoſed to contribute to the merriment of the company when travelling, I endeavoured to make up, in geſtures and laughing, what I was deficient in Dutch. The Dutch however, as I obſerved on another occaſion, laugh with pain, and never without reaſon.</p>

                  <head>THURSDAY.</head>
                  <p>DINED at my friend Myer's upon the Hier Graght, in company with ſeveral Americans—among the reſt was the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miſs P—. After dinner we made a party and ſtrolled through the beſt ſtreets
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:023039_0127_0FBB9CA114E91E70"/>
of this wealthy city. We croſſed the river Amſtel, where we viewed with pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure a vaſt number of ſluices, calculated to communicate the river and the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam canals; we viewed the river from a high bridge, which afforded an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and pleaſing proſpect of the town, river, trees, ſluices and trukſchutes.</p>
                  <p>FINISHED the evening at a place called Vauxhall. We had coffee in a large room, filled with parties under cover of volumes of ſmoke. At the end of the room we were entertained by a company of French and Italian ſingers.</p>
                  <p>ON our return, being curious to ſee the amuſements of a ſpillhouſe, we were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to the moſt celebrated one. But, my ſtars! what a ſcence!—I have never heard Amſterdam mentioned but theſe ſpillhouſes were eſteemed a principal cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity; they are licenſed by the police for
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:023039_0128_0FBB9CA3312EA320"/>
the protection and ſafety of modeſt wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en—and are noted for the regulation they are under. I could not however endure the ſight five minutes—my feelings were too ſenſibly attacked—the ſmoke was ſo thick, and the company ſo vulgar, that I was glad to decamp after having ſatisfied my curioſity. In entering we were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pay for a bottle of <hi>vinegar,</hi> (called wine) whether we had it or not; and then we crowded through a gang of ſmoking jack tars, boors, and vulgar citizens, to the other end of the room; where I was much diverted to ſee a ſtrapping negro fellow dancing a jig with one of the ſpill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe ladies, and an old man playing upon a violin. The dancing was curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enough—they ſeemed to dance, or rather to ſlide, heavily upon their heels, ſcaling about the room, without the leaſt order or animation. Indeed they ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me like a couple of artificial ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines ſet in motion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="132" facs="unknown:023039_0129_0FBB9CA4A27F5450"/>BUT alas! in caſting my eyes about me, I was ſickened to the ſoul with an idea that darted acroſs my brain. There were about forty or fifty of theſe devoted wretches ſeated round the room—they looked like ſo many painted dolls, ſtuck up for ſale: The ſcene carried with it an idea of entering a butcher's ſlaughter houſes, where the calves and ſheep are hung up for the higheſt bidder. Alas! poor human nature, how art thou fallen below the beaſts of the field!—Enough of ſpillhouſes.—Good night.</p>

                  <head>FRIDAY.</head>
                  <p>CONTINUED viewing the city, and drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in at the raſphouſe, ſo much talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of. It is in truth an excellent inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, but there is nothing in the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or diſcipline ſo very remarkable.— From the moment we entered until we left it, we were followed cloſe, and ſtun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:023039_0130_0FBB9CA8CA5510B8"/>
by the cries of charity! charity! From ſeveral of the windows they run out their naked arms—but in vain! as their puniſhments do not appear to be heavily inflicted.</p>
                  <p>THE method of raſping is nothing more than two men ſawing lignum vitae with a raſp ſaw.</p>
                  <p>THEY have in Holland, I am told, another curious method of puniſhing criminals—who are confined at a pump, in a ciſtern of water up to their chins, which runs in as faſt as they can pump it out; ſo that they are obliged to exert themſelves until their ſtrength is exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prevent drowning. I believe this is the method taken to conquer the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy of thoſe who refuſe to labour.</p>

                  <p>DINED at Mynheer Van S—ph—ſt's (a capital merchant) with a brilliant company, in the French ſtyle. Mum was the word two minutes before we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the ſoup. In leaving the polite Dutchman's table, we paid our two flor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins to the ſervant at the door, as regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly as at the table d' hôte in Paris. A moſt barbarous cuſtom, which was exploded not many years ſince in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, where it commonly coſt a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man half a guinea to dine with <hi>his friend.</hi>

                  <p>☞ ON paſſent par une petite poſt du ſallon á manger, dans la commodité. C'eſt pire que la France.</p>
                  <p>IN the evening I had the pleaſure of gallanting <hi>la belle Americane</hi> to the French play, where the company was very bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iant—the beauty and majeſty of her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:023039_0132_0FBB9CAF585F9020"/>
while it gratified my pride, drew the eyes of the Dutch ladies; and I thought I could read in them ſomething like envy; they are however very elegant, both in their perſons and manners, as they riſe above the vulgar.</p>
                  <p>I HAVE more than once had occaſion to remark, that the Engliſh authors are too apt to confine their remarks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on national characters, to the vulgar claſs of mankind, (as though they aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated with no others;) which is extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly illiberal, and has a tendency to impreſs unfair ideas of a nation. In this reſpect the French are infinitely more liberal and good natured. When a Frenchman travels in England, he freely allows them <hi>all their merit.</hi> But how different is it with the Engliſh who travel in France? Sterne and Moore are almoſt the only Engliſh authors who have ſoared above the prejudices of their countrymen.</p>

                     <pb n="136" facs="unknown:023039_0133_0FBB9CB0C00F26E8"/>TO return—my fair countrywoman ſeemed to be the <hi>polar ſtar</hi> when ſhe roſe between the ſcenes, as the rays of all eyes were centered upon her.

                  <head>MONDAY.</head>
                  <p>AT ſeven o'clock this morning I left Amſterdam, with two Americans, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:023039_0134_0FBB9CB2FABB1860"/>
with Mr. F—, of the houſe of de la L—and F—, on our way to Haer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, purpoſely to hear them play on the famous organ already deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>AS my life has been fertile in adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, I had a pleaſing one in the line of gallantry in this excurſion to add to the number. As ſoon as I had ſeated myſelf in the roof of the trukſchute, a very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetious, ſprightly Dutch lady came in, and ſeated herſelf directly oppoſite to me, with only a narrow table between.— Thus ſituated—inattention would have been too cold for a warm conſtitution— Her countenance expreſſed ſo much vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vacity that we ſoon found ourſelves upon ſociable terms—which in its progreſs af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded merriment for my brother travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers quite to Haerlem—where I conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to her lodgings, and parted with regret.—The Dutch ladies ſeem as
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:023039_0135_0FBB9CB462923070"/>
much addicted to intrigue and gallantry as the French.</p>
                  <p>IN one hour I rejoined my companions at the church, and was charmed to hear this aſtoniſhing organ perform. The human voice is ſo admirably imitated, that I almoſt doubted the teſtimony of my own eyes and ears.</p>
                  <p>RETURNED in the afternoon in the body of a trukſchute, full of paſſengers. Another thunder ſtorm attacked us—we were obliged to drop our furled curtains and ſubmit to darkneſs.—In this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a ſingular incident happened, which firſt alarmed and afterwards diverted us extremely. A Dutch Jew in the boat had a peculiar talent of imitating the crying of a child to the niceſt perfection, with an empty pipe, which he did as ſoon as the curtains were dropped—every one ſuppoſing a child in the canal, run their
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:023039_0136_0FBB9CB8B175E938"/>
heads out in the rain on all ſides—the crying inſtantly ceaſed, and we hunted in the canal and in the boat in vain, for a child—This artifice was practiſed upon us ſeveral times before we detected the impoſture. The old women, never at a loſs for a cauſe, began to ſuſpect the boat was haunted.</p>
                  <p>IN the morning I intend for Utrecht, and have it in contemplation to go from thence to Berlin, to ſee the immortal old Frederick. I muſt devote this evening to digeſt the materials I have collected relative to Amſterdam, its trade, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>AMSTERDAM, the capital of the ſeven provinces, lays in lon. 4.30. E. and lat. 52.20. N. two hundred and thirty miles north eaſt from Paris, and two hundred eaſt from London, ſituated upon the river Wye, which empties into the Zuyder Zee. It contains, according to popular eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:023039_0137_0FBB9CB9C5A89BC0"/>
three hundred thouſand ſouls, (I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve two hundred and fifty thouſand) and twenty ſix thouſand houſes, equal to the number in Paris, and perhaps in general as large, though containing only half the number of inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>THIS city was hardly known in the thirteenth century, and owes its riſe and grandeur to the deluge of inhabitants which poured into it from Antwerp in the civil wars.</p>
                  <p>IT is built in form of a creſcent, and well fortified, with a ſtrong wall and twenty ſix baſtions, each of which have a windmill in their centre: The ditch is environed with a ſpacious canal, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhed with a double row of trees. In the extent of their commerce it is thought they will not yield to London, though it is allowed to have been on the decline for many years; this copious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:023039_0138_0FBB9CBBE74B6AF0"/>
I ſhall enter more largely on in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix. Upwards of two thouſand ſhips enter annually in the Wye from every quarter of the globe. The ſhallowneſs of the Zuyder Zee is a great obſtacle in the way of diſpatch; but on the other hand protects them effectually from naval ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. The city is built principally up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on piles, at an enormous expenſe, which may be eaſily conceived when thirteen thouſand were required for the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſtadthouſe alone. The ſtreets are generally wide and well paved, many of which have canals in the middle, with trees on each ſide; ſome of them are eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed the fineſt in Europe. The ſquares are very mean, the moſt conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable of which is the one the ſtadthouſe is built on.</p>
                  <p>THIS is a noble ſtructure, and the principal object in Amſterdam. It is two hundred and eighty two feet long, two
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:023039_0139_0FBB9CBD64378BA0"/>
hundred and thirty five wide, and one hundred ſixteen high, conſtructed with hewn ſtone, and is ſaid to have coſt two millions ſterling. The armory, bank, bells, paintings, and burghers' hall, are the material objects; particularly the hall, which is one hundred and twenty feet long, fifty ſeven broad, and ninety high, all built with marble, which is really aſtoniſhing, when we conſider that there is ſcarcely a native pebble to be ſeen in the whole country. The floor repreſents, in marble, the celeſtial and terreſtrial globes, and the conſtellations in the heavens, moſt curiouſly inlaid.</p>
                  <p>THE houſes are built, in general, of brick—ſome of hewn ſtone. The ſtreets are not ſo clean, nor the houſes ſo ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, in general, as thoſe of Rotterdam; but the ſtreets are well paved. All re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions are tolerated—but Calviniſm is by far the moſt extenſive, and no other
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:023039_0140_0FBB9CC227B39AD0"/>
churches are allowed bells. The arſenal well merits ſeeing, as well as the dock yard, which lies contiguous to it, and is five hundred and eight feet long, and well ſupplied with naval ſtores.</p>
                  <p>THE air is ſtrongly impregnated with noxious vapours, and the ſtench which riſes from the canals. The water is bad; the beſt for common uſe is that which the clouds empty into their ciſterns.</p>
                  <p>THE hoſpitals, and other charitable inſtitutions, are very great, as they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port upwards of twenty thouſand poor in this way—but they do not hold a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the vaſt profuſion the citizens of London beſtow for theſe benevolent purpoſes, much to their honour.</p>
                  <p>THIS city is governed by a Senate of thirty ſix perſons. Trumpeters are kept upon the ſteeples and towers in the
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:023039_0141_0FBB9CC4277B9310"/>
night, to give the alarm in caſe of fire. The revenues of Amſterdam, it is ſaid, amount to fifty thouſand florins a day. Their trade extends to all quarters, but the moſt lucrative is to the Eaſtindies.</p>

                  <head>TUESDAY.</head>
                  <p>AT ſix o'clock this cloudy morning I embarked on board the Utrecht trukſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chute, with a Mr. Vanbiber (an Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can gentleman) and a full freight of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, and in nine hours ſailing we reached Utrecht. We ſailed through a beautiful country, more abounding in elegant ſeats and ſummer houſes, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the wealthy citizens of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam) than any part of Holland I have yet ſeen; eſpecially within a few miles of Utrecht, where we ſaw a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued chain of them, ſome of which were mere palaces.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="unknown:023039_0142_0FBB9CC81620CF68"/>DINED at a Mr. Peterſon's, a rich mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, and an American by birth. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter dinner he conducted us into every part of this city, which is built upon a natural elevation compared to the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time cities. It lies twenty three miles S. E. from Amſterdam, is eſteemed healthy, and rendered remarkable in hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, for the celebrated treaty which ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented the union of the Seven Provinces, in 1579.</p>
                  <p>IT contains from twenty to thirty thouſand inhabitants—party ſpirit runs high among the citizens, who are arming, and exerciſing every day in oppoſition to the prince of Orange; whoſe party ſtyle it rebellion, and a French faction. The citizens are ſo inveterate againſt the Engliſh, that it is almoſt dangerous for one to be ſeen in the ſtreets. Military diſtraction beats high in every vein; but nature and humanity ſhrink from the
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:023039_0143_0FBB9CCB03789490"/>
tragick thought, that theſe enchanting fields may be verging faſt to the fatal change into parks of bellowing murder, encampments, and ſcenes of death, where family kindred may be darting the weap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of deſtruction at each other.</p>
                  <p>VIEWED the old cathedral, the middle of which is blown down, but the tower is entire. Saw the monument of an old biſhop, with fourteen others in <hi>baſſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievo,</hi> the heads of which were all batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pieces, at the time of the violent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious perſecution, which occaſioned the revolt in the bloody reign of Philip II.</p>
                  <p>WE aſcended the top of the tower, which is three hundred and ſeventy feet high, by four hundred and ſixty ſteps; where we had a moſt ſublime view of all the low country, the Downs, Haerlem lake, and Zuyder Zee; our horizon was rather hazy, which obſtructed a much
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:023039_0144_0FBB9CCCAEF73568"/>
more extenſive proſpect. I am told that in a clear day, fifty walled cities may be comprehended in one view from this place.</p>
                  <p>THE country in the vicinity of Utrecht appeared like a continued garden. A chain of ſmall hills and the Downs in ſome meaſure checked our view to the eaſtward. The wind blew a gale, and I was almoſt apprehenſive that this crazy old tower, which has reſiſted ſieges and tempeſts for near a thouſand years, would at laſt tumble down and bury poor me in its ruins: The roaring of the winds through the hollow arches, and the ruins of the old church under us, naturally excited theſe vapours; ſo I hurried down to examine the univerſity; after which I went to a famous garden, belonging to Madame Van Mollem, and adjoining to a ſilk machine, which is conſtructed nearly upon the ſame principles as the one I
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:023039_0145_0FBB9CD2981FF6E0"/>
ſaw at Derby in England, in 1782.— One water wheel (a curioſity in Holland) ſet the whole machine in motion.</p>
                  <p>THIS garden is upon a very large ſcale, and contains every object which can render a garden delightful and curious— ſuch as caſcades differently diſplayed, grottos, ſtatues, vaſes, and a variety of imitations in evergreens, viz. baſkets, &amp;c. &amp;c. in a very ingenious manner.</p>
                  <p>THE two grottos, the gardener tells us, coſt ten thouſand pounds ſterling each, being moſtly formed by a rare collection of ſhells from the different quarters of the globe. In this charming garden we ſpent a full hour, and could eaſily have found entertainment for a day<note n="*" place="bottom">THE Dutch are confeſſedly the beſt gardeners in Europe.</note>.</p>
                  <p>THE antipathy between the Engliſh and the citizens of Utrecht, has ſubſiſted
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:023039_0146_0FBB9CD4A46D2648"/>
on the part of the Engliſh ſince the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier treaty made with Louis XIV, ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to them. On the part of the citizens, on account of the colluſive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the ſtadtholder in the late war with the Engliſh.</p>
                  <p>WE next viewed the mall, which is ſaid to be the largeſt in Europe—It is three quarters of a mile in length, and formed by four double rows of ſtately trees.— When Louis XIV ſubdued, or rather took quiet poſſeſſion of Utrecht, in 1672, he gave orders to protect this delightful promenade.</p>
                  <p>UTRECHT has no particular curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties or elegant publick buildings; but the city is ſuppoſed to be larger than the Hague, though thinly peopled. Many of the houſes are very elegant, and the pavements exceedingly neat and white.</p>

                     <pb n="150" facs="unknown:023039_0147_0FBB9CD625CB2FA8"/>PREVIOUSLY to my leaving Amſterdam I had determined to continue my route with Mr. Vanbiber, through Weſtphalia and Saxony, to Berlin; but receiving a letter ſoon after my arrival here, from London, via Amſterdam, I am induced to ſet off immediately for Helvoetſluys, as the packet will ſail from thence in the morning.—Adieu!</p>

                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I HAVE but this moment got on board, and am ſo much worn down with fatigue that I can ſcarcely ſtand. The wind now blows a complete gale, ſo I muſt improve the moment, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe I ſhall ſoon be too ſick to tell you how I got along.</p>
               <p>LAST evening, at eight o'clock, I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked on board the Leyden trukſchute at Utrecht, with a civil ſkipper, and, for the firſt time ſince I have been in Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:023039_0149_0FBB9CDCF16562C0"/>
I found my French and Engliſh of no avail; of courſe I was obliged to pound Dutch with the Captain.</p>
               <p>I HAD the cabin or roof all to myſelf, which I wiſhed to avoid, as I feel a ſtrong propenſity to improve every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſociety; of which ſcarcely any ſort can come amiſs to one who travels for information.—Under this impreſſion I left the cabin and entered upon the liſt of ſmokers in the body of the boat; but found no one diſpoſed to be ſociable with a poor fellow who had not a word to ſay for himſelf. So, finding my tongue uſeleſs, I returned again to my cabin, and ſpent the night upon cuſhions on the bench, ſometimes viewing the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from the cabin windows by a fair moon light, and reading occaſionally.</p>
               <p>WE deſcended the canal as far as the town of Woerden, which is walled in—
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:023039_0150_0FBB9CE3252093E0"/>
here we entered a branch of the Rhine, and gave ourſelves up to its gentle cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; and in this pleaſing ſituation we continued deſcending the river, and paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many villages and a pleaſant country, till we reached Leyden, at ſix o'clock in the morning. I found this new mode of travelling much more agreeable than on the canals, as the river is wider and the water continually alive. Beſides, it was a ſublime ſcene in the night to view the effect of the moon upon the country, through a double row of trees planted on the banks of the river.</p>
               <p>I PASSED through the ſtreets of Ley<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and immediately reembarked upon the Delft canal. Saw the burgeoiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der arms in the ſtadthouſe. Since my laſt paſſing, the contending parties have had a ſmall puſh in the bayonet way.— Unhappily the ſeeds of a civil war ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear but too thickly ſcattered in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:023039_0151_0FBB9CE46414B990"/>
country. Heaven avert the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending ſtorm!</p>
               <p>AT nine o'clock I arrived in Delft, but fearful of truſting to a trukſchute paſſage, on account of their ſlow prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs, I hired a man and chaiſe to drive me to Maeſlandſluice. We rattled over the pavements, and then travelled upon the edge of the canal with great expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, five miles, to Maeſlandſluice, which I found a conſiderable town, built partly on an eminence, which I ſuppoſe is arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial. The harbour was full of fiſhing veſſels; and though it is the reſidence chiefly of fiſhermen, it will vie, I am told, with almoſt any town in Holland, for neatneſs and pleaſant ſtreets, with canals, trees, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>HALF a mile farther I embarked on board a ferry boat—croſſed the Maes in a gale—landed upon the little iſland
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:023039_0152_0FBB9CE6C032EF10"/>
Rooſenburg—croſſed the iſland in a cart —ferried again to the Brille—took a rattling waggon, and drove on ſeven miles through the mud, to Helvoetſluys— where I was immediately almoſt ſtunned with the cry of run! run! the packet is juſt weighing anchor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I flew to the commiſſary—paid twelve ſhillings and ſix pence for my paſs (a villanous impoſition by the way)—and the inſtant I arrived at the head of the quay the boat was puſhing off into a boiſterous ſea. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I tumbled on board—any how— and juſt ſaved myſelf to a hair—and ſhall now leave my journal, entirely beat out with fatigue. I will venture to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that there have been but few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the ſame ſpace of ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meaſured in Holland, within the ſame ſpace of time. Our paſſengers were aſtoniſhed to find how expeditiouſly I flew acroſs the country.—Adieu!</p>

               <p>IT is not an hour ſince I ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and you would laugh heartily to ſee what a figure I make. I left off my journal very ſea ſick—we had indeed a moſt unpleaſant paſſage of twenty four hours, and a tumultuous head ſea, which kept our packet dancing merrily upon the waves; but we miſerable paſſengers were no otherwiſe ſociable than in caſcading <hi>en concert</hi> over our lee quarter, which we kept up ſociably until the moment we landed on the coaſt of Suffolk. We fell
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:023039_0154_0FBB9CECD1481668"/>
in off Yarmouth, and ſailed along the high coaſt of England, till abreaſt of Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tof, and then we embarked reluctantly, fourteen in number, on board of an open fiſhing boat, two miles from the ſhore, with a ſqually black atmoſphere for our comfort. No conſideration would have induced us to hazard ſuch a riſk but the miſery of confinement, perhaps twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four hours longer, with the ſhore aboard.</p>
               <p>WE landed in the ſurges beating upon the ſhore, and refreſhed ourſelves moſt comfortably—with a reviving diſh of good tea to ſettle our giddy heads. I have frequently experienced, in different countries, the immediate good effects of this favourite herb, after a fatiguing day's journey, or ſea ſickneſs—It operates as effectual relief as opium in other caſes. The French uſe tea as a medicine; the Engliſh, Dutch and Americans, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuation,
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:023039_0155_0FBB9CEEE9466800"/>
on all occaſions<note n="*" place="bottom">I HAVE, in my travels, ſome where found a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſubſtitute for coffee, in barley, ground and burnt in the ſame manner: Indeed I could hardly diſtinguiſh the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the taſte, when ſweetened previouſly to boiling.— Barley grows plentifully in Northamerica, and if this beverage ſhould become prevalent there, it will not only ſave its inhabitants from the riſk of a ſlow poiſon in the uſe of teas, but nearly half a million ſpecie annually, within the United States.</note>. Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and bad teeth are commonly attrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uted to the exceſſive uſe of hot tea—with what juſtice I know not: But the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing fact has reconciled me to that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief—that conſumptions are unknown in France, and their teeth are generally good —but in England, Holland and America conſumptions are very prevalent; and the American women in particular are curſed with bad teeth for the moſt part, which I ſuppoſe may be partly owing to neglect as well as tea. A fine ſet of teeth preſerves in old age the appearance of youth.</p>
               <p>WE immediately prepared for London, but for the want of a better convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:023039_0156_0FBB9CF066C53F48"/>
we were obliged to travel in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon horſe cart twenty five miles, acroſs the country to Sexmundy, like ſo many condemned criminals on their way to Tyburn. The ſituation was indeed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely novel, and pleaſed us of courſe; but we were frequently incommoded by the rain, as well as by the ridicule of the country people.</p>
               <p>FOR my part, as I had ſcarcely been in bed ſince leaving Haerlem, and my eyes were fairly ſwelled for want of ſleep, I determined to enjoy this night undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed; for which purpoſe I prevailed on one of my fellow travellers to bear me company; but notwithſtanding our endeavours to refreſh the claims of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a crazy young landlord burſt into our room before midnight, wild—and frantick.—We curſed his impudence moſt cordially, but were too much out of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour to attempt a ſecond ſleep, and
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:023039_0157_0FBB9CF40F2D8F20"/>
conſequently we immediately ſet off for Ipſwich, where we arrived juſt at the dawn of day.</p>
               <p>THE town appeared to us large, but the houſes ſmall, and every object ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly flat and dirty, after leaving the magnificent and clean ſtreets of the Dutch cities.</p>
               <p>WE took in two or three briſk young widows who accompanied us to Colcheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. We have had a fine day, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing for the heavineſs of our leaden eyes, were as merry as we could wiſh.</p>
               <p>I SHALL now ſum up with ſome gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral obſervations reſpecting the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Provinces at large, and their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, with a ſhort ſketch of each prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince in particular, which will complete my tour to that country; and I think you will do me the juſtice to confeſs I

            <head>ORIGIN and DESCRIPTION OF THE <hi>UNITED PROVINCES.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HOLLAND belonged origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally to the houſe of Burgundy, and fell under that of Auſtria, which united it to the Spaniſh crown, by the ſucceſſion of Charles V, to that throne. The bigot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and bloody perſecutions of his ſon Philip II, produced a revolt in the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen provinces, ten of which returned to their allegiance; and the preſent United Provinces purſued their oppoſition (with a degree of bravery and perſeverance that
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:023039_0160_0FBB9CFAF94AEA78"/>
reflects honour on human nature) until the year 1648, when they were declared independent, after a glorious ſtruggle of ſeventy ſix bloody years, valiantly fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through four ſucceeding generations, for every bleſſing of civil and religious liberty, dear to mankind. The vaſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions they had wreſted from the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe in the Eaſtindies, either by fraud or by force, enabled them to contend with ſucceſs againſt Spaniſh gold, and two of the moſt powerful monarchs in Europe.</p>
            <p>THE Seven Provinces, which compoſe this formidable republick, the wonder and admiration of the world—are Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Zealand, Frieſland, Guelderland, Overyſſel, Groningen and Utrecht.— They extend about one hundred and fifty miles each way, including the Zuyder Zee and Haerlem lake; which, taken with their rivers, and numerous canals, leaves a doubt which of the elements,
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:023039_0161_0FBB9CFDBAA28368"/>
land or water, occupies the greateſt ſpace within this area, which embraces, by a late calculation, nine thouſand one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty ſquare miles. The Maes and the Rhine are the principal rivers.</p>
            <p>TRAVELLING is cheaper in Holland than in any other country, as it does not exceed one penny ſterling per mile in the trukſchutes, excluſive of baggage.</p>
            <p>THE face of the earth lying level, and often lower than the ſurface of the ſea, naturally leads a ſtranger to imagine that the whole country has eſcaped by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the dominion of the ocean, which will apparently ſooner or later reaſſume its prerogative, of which their hiſtory furniſhes many frightful examples; in particular the fatal inundation, already mentioned, in 1421.</p>
            <p>THE heavineſs of this foggy and moiſt atmoſphere is undoubtedly unhealthy:
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:023039_0162_0FBB9CFEAA26FC30"/>
And it is from this circumſtance that their ſlovenly neighbours wiſh to rob them of the merit of their exceſſive neatneſs, as they ſay (and perhaps with ſome reaſon) that it is a merit of neceſſity to have their houſes painted, and every thing around them clean and bright.</p>
            <p>THEIR winters begin in October and end in March. The ſummers are often very hot, ſhort, and ſubject to frequent changes. The number of inhabitants varies extremely in the popular eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but from the beſt information they do not exceed two millions and an half, which are evidently on the decline, ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a variety of concurrent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. The two principal cauſes, it is ſuppoſed, ariſe from the inſenſible decline of manufactures, and conſequently of commerce—with the increaſe of luxury, and a great degeneracy from their virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous anceſtors, who procured them their
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:023039_0163_0FBB9D02F4AC11E0"/>
independence, and left the government eſtabliſhed upon the broad baſis of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, induſtry, enterpriſe, and frugality.</p>
            <p>THOSE who pretend to pry deep into futurity, predict their total annihilation as an independent power. It is at leaſt evident that their vaſt and rich poſſeſſions in the Eaſtindies, will eventually produce the ſame effect upon Holland, as the gold mines of Southamerica have upon Spain —I mean national debility, corruption, loſs of manufactures, and conſequently poverty<note n="*" place="bottom">SEVERAL nations of Europe now manufacture the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles they formerly received from the Dutch, particularly the Engliſh.</note>.</p>
            <p>SHOULD the Emperor perſevere in his wiſe and ambitious plan of opening the Scheld, and reviving the commerce of Antwerp (once the emporium and glory of Europe) it will moſt certainly tend to accelerate their rapid decline. The Scheld
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:023039_0164_0FBB9D041E9A2310"/>
is a noble river, and will admit ſhips of any burthen quite up to the city, which is very eaſy of acceſs from the North Sea, and has a communication with the Rhine, Maes, and Lis. In this caſe a doubt cannot be entertained but Antwerp would rapidly riſe to its former ſplendour, and ſoon be crowded with commercial adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers from all quarters of Europe, and even from Holland itſelf, as Germany will open a wide field for enterpriſe. As Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam roſe on the ruins of Antwerp, ſo it is probable that Antwerp would on thoſe of Amſterdam, and perhaps almoſt reſume its former rank among the cities of Europe, were once the Scheld opened.</p>
            <p>THE main ſprings of the Dutch wealth in the Eaſtindies, is the monopoly of the ſpice trade, in which they are in ſome danger of meeting rivals, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their art and induſtry to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="168" facs="unknown:023039_0165_0FBB9D05A23AD140"/>IT is ſaid that in the garden of the king of France, in the Iſle of France, they have raiſed 10,000 weight of cinnamon, and 30,000 weight of cloves, beſides oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſpices. This ſecret was ſtolen from Ceylon, Amboyna, and Banda, by ſome French merchants.</p>
            <p>THE canals in Holland are ſo much frequented that the roads are neglected, and in general very bad, but moſtly lined with trees, barriers, and turnpikes at ſhort diſtances.</p>
            <p>THERE are no regular poſt coaches— conſequently every one is ſubject to the impoſition of the waggoners.</p>
            <p>THIS country is curious becauſe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembles no other; but a continued uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity ſoon cloys a traveller, though the objects are pleaſing, and keep his mind continually alive. In general, after ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

one town you have ſeen the reſt.— The country without their walls holds to the ſame general ſymmetry; a continued marſhy plain covered with cattle. The principal lands are devoted to gardens and paſtures.</p>
            <p>THE Dutch in high life are a type of the French. Their merchants, and thoſe who rank in this ſtanding, are certainly more graceful and eaſy in their addreſs than the Engliſh of the ſame claſs; but as a nation, they may be conſidered as a dull, cold, diſtant and inhoſpitable peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, eſpecially to foreigners, unleſs rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ommended in warm terms.</p>

               <p>HOLLAND is entirely flat, except the Downs along the ſea coaſt, and the ſoil is rather light.</p>
               <p>IN November, particularly in North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holland, the country is totally buried in water; ſo that no other objects preſent to view but dikes, ſteeples and houſes, riſing out of the ſea. In this ſeaſon the inhabitants are, to all intents, in the ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of amphibious animals emerging out of water. Theſe inundations fatten the fields, and are drawn off again in February in a moſt curious manner, by mills invented for the purpoſe. The country is protected from the common rake of the ſea, by dikes and the Downs.</p>

The meadows afford fine grazing for vaſt flocks of cattle which cover them. Holland is indeed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued meadow, interſected with canals, lakes and rivers, which are well ſtored with fiſh.</p>
               <p>THEIR foreign trade knows no bounds upon the globe. They have no grain of their own culture, but are the granary of Europe; no vineyards, but they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Europe with the beſt of wines; no ſtaple, but they have every thing in their ports, cheaper, often, than any other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Such are the happy effects of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and enterpriſe.—But, alas! poor Holland, thy ſun has paſſed its meridian, and, as in a long ſummer's day, it edges ſlowly to the horizon.—In point of ſtrength and riches, they equal the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſix provinces—and as manufactures decline, and land continues high, the
