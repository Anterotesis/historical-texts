            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AT a time when the trial of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity ſeems brought to the CRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIS, when hopes and fears alternate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſwell every boſom which can feel for the greateſt intereſts of mankind, it gives me pleaſure to ſee the Rulers of this State the <hi>firſt</hi> to ſtep forth and invite their conſtituents, by the ſolemnities of this day, to repeat their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the all-gracious Being who hath ever patronized the cauſe of virtue; who ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues the juſt Arbiter of all events, and holds the ballance of univerſal empire in his hands.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:016379_0003_0F9C70E1ABBA6D70"/>IT is a mournful evidence of groſs depravity of heart, when religious ſervices of this nature loſe their ſolemnity by becoming ordinary and familiar: and it is a fact which no words or tears can ſufficiently lament, nor any man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the public manners can deny, that our public faſts, ſo frequently repeated ſince our preſent calamities began, are followed with ſo little which has the ſhew of reformation, that it is no ſuperſtition to indulge a fear that they are not the faſts that the Lord has choſen; but through frequency degenerated into an unmean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing formality: this I conſider as one of the moſt gloomy ſymptoms of the times; and ſhould it be found continuing without abatement after this day, there is reaſon to dread that, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever pious the deſign of the appointment, our pretence of obſerving it, without meaning any reformation in thoſe things that have drawn down and ſtill continue the ſtrokes of heaven upon us, will be charged againſt us as a repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a deliberate mockery of the Searcher of all hearts.</p>
            <p>I have ever thought it expedient, on occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this kind, to accommodate the ſervices of the day to the <hi>ſpecial</hi> intent of its appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but the Proclamation which now calls us together has not held up to view any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular purpoſe as more eſpecially intended; it ſeems rather deſigned to invite us to turn aſide, and ſeriouſly reflect on the ſituation of our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic affairs, conſidered in a complex and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive

light; and it is in compliance with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign that choice has been made of the words how read as the motto for a few obſervations, in which all attention to method ſhall be ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly waved, and the thoughts which the preſent hurry of my circumſtances have allowed ſhall be freely laid before you, in a ſeries of Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; requeſting only that they may be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſame friendly diſpoſition for the public weal with which they are now offered as a mite, to the abundance which others are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to the ſaving this diſtreſſed country from impending ruin.</p>
            <p>THE ſtruggles of an oppreſſed people for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the civil and religious privileges by which God had diſtinguiſhed them from all the reſt of the world—the manner in which their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts were conducted the oppoſitions they met— and the ſucceſs which crowned their virtuous labors are the ſubject matter of the whole of that book from whence the text is taken—the ſcope of the inſpired author appears to be the ſetting up a laſting monument of one of the moſt remarkable deeds of Providence in favor of the church of old, which ſhould be to the praiſe of the God of Iſrael in all ſucceeding ages.</p>

with the ſimilarity between the caſe of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh church, as it relates it, and that of confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated America at this time, and could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear the mention of it to you on the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p>YET, as the ſtory of the grand emancipation of the church of God cannot be fully learnt without joining the accounts of this author to thoſe of the other ſacred writers that have trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the ſubject, and eſpecially to the tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions related by Ezra, I ſhall therefore, in the ſequel, take the liberty of referring you to the author laſt mentioned, and to the writer of this book promiſcuouſly, and conſider the text as the concluſion to which we are pointed in the whole.</p>
            <p>PROPOSITION I. All men are by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alike—the faculties, powers, and paſſions or each ſubſtantially the ſame: to the full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of theſe, and to the enjoyments thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting they are equally entitled.</p>
            <p>SOCIALITY is eſſential to the human frame —abſolute ſolitude is abhorred by every princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in it. Felicity is improved by communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—and hence from a deſire of imparting the pleaſure he feels, as well as of ſharing in the happineſs of others, man is prompted to ſeek ſociety with man. To this he is urged alſo by a ſenſe of the dangers to which his deareſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments are expoſed from the luſts of his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows—equally with himſelf ſunk into a depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity that regards no difference between right and wrong: againſt the encroachments of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016379_0006_0F9C70E3EDB969F0"/>
his ſingle arm he finds to be too feeble a defence: and hence from a new neceſſity he is ſtimulated to ſeek the protection of others:</p>
            <p>THESE principles in like manner operating on the human race in common, eaſily introduce a ſocial compact among them; and thus God cements mankind into ſociety for their greater good; while each, conſenting to ſubmit his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the ſeveral powers with which he is veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the cognizance of the whole body, agrees to deny himſelf ſuch gratifications as are deemed incompatible with the felicity of the reſt, though conſcious that his perſonal ability is ſufficient ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately to obtain them:</p>
            <p>THIS may be conſidered as a reſignation of certain rights poſſeſſed by each in their ſtate of nature, yet as it is equally the act of every member, their entrance into ſociety is on the footing of perfect equality—and the ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der being freely made for the ſecurity of rights eſteemed more valuable, no member can be a loſer by the compact—the perſonal privileges reſigned being held by the ſociety in truſt, may ſtill be ſaid to be virtually enjoyed by the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal poſſeſſor.</p>
            <p>BESIDES theſe no other rights may be wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from men by ſociety—the powers veſted in its officers are delegated to them as ſervants of the body, and meant only to ſecure, to exerciſe, and improve theſe to the benefit of the owners.</p>
            <p>NO man in a ſtate of nature has a right to do wrong—therefore he can lodge no ſuch right
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016379_0007_0F9C70E4AC9986B8"/>
in the hands of ſociety—nor can the body pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect any member in a claim of this ſort: no man in either ſtate may uſurp the rights of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which that other hath not freely conceded, nor any for which, upon conceſſion, he has not received full compenſation: no man can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede the rights neceſſary to his being—or being a moral agent—a ſubject of moral government; of reward and puniſhment—the rights of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate judgment and of conſcience are therefore as unalienable as the faculty of intelligence, and the right of acquiring and enjoying property can no more be bartered away than the natural ſtrength or genius that acquires it, or the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral life which is maintained by the acquiſition; partly becauſe the transfer cannot take place, though both parties ſhould conſent; as no man can add to the life or faculties of another by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to him his own; and partly becauſe, if it could, no equivalent could be repaid in lieu of the conceſſion.</p>
            <p>INDEED, when any individual goes on to abuſe the rights he enjoys to the deſtruction of thoſe of others, he thereby threatens and endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers all; it is the plain dictate of the original compact, that the whole power of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſhould then be employed to confine and diſable him—and this may be continued until he has given full compenſation for the injury done, and ſufficient ſecurity againſt his future attempts: in no other way may men be reduced to a ſtate of ſervitude, or retained in it; becauſe
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:016379_0008_0F9C70E56AD70E68"/>
no power beyond this was lodged by ſociety in the hands of its officers—nor could there be, ſince there was none in the ſociety itſelf; and this is evident, becauſe none ſuch could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned by individuals: all exertions of power then which exceed this line are uſurpation, not authority: are rebellion and treaſon againſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, reaſon, nature and God: and as ſuch, whenever they appear, ought to be reſiſted, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated and puniſhed.</p>
            <p>THE nations therefore that ſupport or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive at the practice of enſlaving the human ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, as an article of commerce, ought to be conſidered in a ſtate of war againſt all mankind; ſince none can be thought willing to wear that public brand of the antichriſtian beaſt—a traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic conſiſting of the ſouls of men, unleſs they had previouſly conſpired the extirpation of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remain of virtue and humanity from the face of the earth:</p>
            <p>TO this conſideration due attention will, I truſt, be paid by all theſe riſing States: for ſhould a toleration of the ſlave trade be now mingled with our new Conſtitutions, that leaven will ſoon corrupt the whole lump: ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance at the practice of making or retaining ſlaves amongſt ourſelves betray a ſecret envy of the liberties of our fellow men, would it not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail the curſe of heaven on all our ſtruggles for the defence of our own?</p>
            <p>PROP. II. <hi>Societies to each other, ſtand related no otherwiſe than individuals in a ſtate of nature:</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:016379_0009_0F9C70E64809A1E8"/>
all poſſeſs the ſame natural rights—within the ſame limitations—and on the ſame conditions; and there is nothing in the law of nature or the relation between them to warrant one to invade the enjoyments of another, any intire than if they were private perſons, utterly unconnected with ſociety and each with other: what though it be granted that when two ſocieties go on in wickedneſs the one is often found to be let looſe for the puniſhment of the other, and ſometimes even to the enſlaving it? This will never weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the concluſion now drawn until it can be proved that the divine permiſſion excuſes the ſin of the injurious party.</p>
            <p>PROP. III. <hi>God has ſet up the Jewiſh church as a ſample of his government.</hi> By it he has put a glaſs into the hands of the world: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his providence towards that people <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

IV. <hi>While the manners of a nation profeſſing religion continue pleaſing to God, he ſecures their liberties againſt all invaders:</hi> the paternal care of his providence is as a wall of fire around them: numerous were the proofs of this in the condition of the people of Iſrael in the days of Joſhua and the Judges; how often do we there behold a weak and inconſiderable handful ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to chaſtiſe the inſolence of powerful hoſts —one chaſing a thouſand and two putting ten thouſands to flight! Benefits of all ſorts are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents entruſted to men for improvement: the enjoyment of temporal good gives new force to the virtues of the virtuous man—as chryſtal looks brighter in the beams of the ſun. But through the wickedneſs of men the ſmiles of Providence are often perverted into proviſion for luſt, as the ſhowers that are ſweet when diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilled from the clouds are turned into ſalt when they ſink in the ocean. Hence proſperity fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently becomes a poiſon in diſguiſe—the ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in taſte, the more fatal in effect: nations, as well as individuals, are generally intoxicated by it—the unthankfulneſs of ſome proclaims them barren as the ſands of Africa—others, like Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <p>PROP. V. <hi>The honor of divine Government is concerned that national ſins meet national puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi> the being of God's law requires that every tranſgreſſion and diſobedience receive a juſt recompence of reward; the juſtice of his
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:016379_0011_0F9C70E7AB8065F8"/>
adminiſtration neceſſitates that the penalty be inflicted in the ſame meaſures in which it was threatened—leſs will not be looked for in reaſon from the hand of the ſupreme Guardian of the intereſts of virtue, who by a different conduct would, more effectually than all other beings, encourage the wicked and deter the obedient. This expectation is anſwered by the fact: no inſtance of tranſgreſſion ever did or will paſs unpuniſhed—the ſinner himſelf ſhall pay the debt, or his ſurety muſt diſcharge the uttermoſt farthing.</p>
            <p>THERE is a fitneſs in adapting the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the crime, that ſo the latter might be pointed out by the former: hence it appears congruous to wiſdom that they who have ſinned together ſhould ſuffer in like manner—and that the fellow-ſinner who has been the occaſion— the means or incitement to the crime, ſhould alſo ſerve as the engine for the puniſhment of the criminal. Thus nations combined in a courſe of tranſgreſſion muſt be dealt with collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively when it is puniſhed. Hence we conclude that national ſins muſt be puniſhed in this life; becauſe nations, as ſuch, exiſt not in the next; and ſo, if not here, cannot at all be made to feel, in their national capacity, the deſert of their crimes.</p>
            <p>THE goodneſs of God is clearly illuſtrated in the patience with which he forbears the ſtroke: the ſlow gradations with which his people are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected diſcover all the father in the corrector's
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016379_0012_0F9C70E876139CD8"/>
heart; whilſt the rod of correction is in his hand, what bowels! what meltings may be ſeen in the ſtripes! every touch ſeems interrupted with thoſe tender interrogatives 'how can I give thee up O Ephraim! how can I deliver thee O Iſrael! my bowels are turned within me, my relentings are gathered together.'</p>
            <p>THE lenity of divine government, when long abuſe as an argument for inſult, at laſt is rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to indignation, and tho' judgments on earth are inflicted piece-meal, yet in the iſſue the incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible muſt be given up to the ſcourge.</p>
            <p>THE higher the riſe of national guilt, the greater is the neceſſity that the puniſhment be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent, public, and ſpeedy. The people high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in profeſſions and privileges ſhould therefore be foremoſt under the rod. The holineſs of the Sovereign is publicly diſplayed when judgments begin at the houſe of God. In the execution of theſe, he often employs his worſt foes, as men uſe the meaneſt ſlave for the vileſt drudgery.</p>
            <p>THE end of all, is to humble the ſinning peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to bring them to repentance, and reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to theſe the means uſed will be proportioned by wiſdom: not a drop of bitter will be min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled in their cup but what is neceſſary: not a ſtripe laid on which their caſe could diſpenſe with: nor ſhall their heavineſs endure one night long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than their need of it laſts:</p>
            <p>THAT the afflictions of a profeſſing people ſhould not fail of accompliſhing this end, the moſt important intereſts of virtue and godlineſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire:
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016379_0013_0F9C70E92C013A70"/>
partly becauſe the ſins which brought them on are more highly aggravated than the ſins of others: and partly becauſe the honor of God is moſt concerned that things be kept <hi>right</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſuch, leſt they totally go off, and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thus be extinct in the world, leſt the ignorant and wicked ſhould hence take occaſion to call e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil good, and religion itſelf be charged as patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing the crimes of its profeſſors.</p>
            <p>WHEN the proper effect is not produced by ſuch judgments, but the people prove hardened in their vicious ways, they have reaſon to expect their continuance with additional ſeverities: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is the ſame reaſon for continuing as for commencing them, and ſimilar cauſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſimilar effects: and over and above the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes paſt the new degrees of hardneſs which have withſtood the remedy already applied, make per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in correcting neceſſary to vindicate the honor of God's unchangeableneſs, omnipotence, and infallible wiſdom in the choice of means ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to the end. Thus we ſee the people of Iſrael, gradually threatened, and gradually puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but diſcovering an obduracy which was proof againſt all, they were at laſt led captives to Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, and rivetted on themſelves the chain of ſlavery.</p>
            <p>A people thus ripened for the judgments of heaven in vain ſeek protection from their rulers: the magiſtrate who has led on the general revolt from the ways of God, ſeldom fails to prove as active a tool in aggravating the woes that ensue
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:016379_0014_0F9C70E9EB36B6B0"/>
thereon: ſo Jehoiakin conſents to curry favor for himſelf, by abetting the tyranny of the Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an monarch and confirming the ſlavery of his own captivated ſubjects: miſerable reward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for the unlimited obedience they had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly paid him!—Poor wages truly for loyalty to a king maintained by a courſe of rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God! Thus tyrants falling like falling an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, never chooſe to ſuffer alone, their diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pride, impatient of any comforts ſurpaſſing their own, makes them reſolved enemies of all mankind; and will ſtrain every nerve to pull all down into the ſame ruin with themſelves.</p>
            <p>PROP. VI. <hi>When the end of the correction has once been obtained, the deliverance of the afflicted ſhall ſuffer no delay.</hi> Neither the depth of their diſtreſs, nor the deſperateneſs of the caſe, nor the want of reſources, nor the defection of friends ſhall retard or prevent the needed releaſe, any more than the multitude of clouds that darken the night can defer the morning dawn, or poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pone the riſing of the ſun: the time to viſit his diſtreſſed ones, the ſet time, ſhall come: and then the Lord need but ſpeak the word, and it is done: when Iſrael does evil in the fight of the Lord we commonly ſee an adverſary commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned to devour his ſtrength, but no ſooner is he humbled and cries to the Author of all his help, than lo! to his own aſtoniſhment, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the amazement of all around, ſome inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is inſtantly raiſed up for his reſcue, and by a ſudden tranſition from the depth of woe we

behold him emerging into honor and power. Sometimes the great Deliverer chooſes a pebble from their own brook to proſtrate their moſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantic oppreſſors, and ſometimes he moves the heart of an alien to reſtore them the liberty which their own kings overthrew. Thus CYRUS a pagan prince, unconnected by nation, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion an enemy, monarch of the empire that had perſecuted their fathers, that had razed their cities, aboliſhed their ordinances and levelled their temple to the ground.—CYRUS, ſtirred up by the Lord alone, unſolicited by men, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of detriment from any plot of his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, proclaims the remains of oppreſſed Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, <hi>free</hi> and <hi>independent</hi> in their greateſt privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, thoſe of the religion of the God of their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he rouſes every dormant principle of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm among them to exert itſelf on the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion for the re-eſtabliſhment of their invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble liberties, and freely furniſhes the undertakers of the work with treaſures and all things neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the full accompliſhment of the purpoſe. See Ezra i. throughout.</p>
            <p>HAD a Jew refuſed the benefit from educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal prejudice againſt the hand that offered it, or ſuperſtitious ſcruple about the lawfulneſs of accepting the friendſhip of a <hi>power</hi> that diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his religion, who could have avoided charging him with atheiſm who would not acknowledge the hand of God in producing this happy event by means ſo unlikely, ſo contrary to the policy of nations, and ſo far without the line of proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility?

May God puniſh by what hand he will? And may he not deliver by an inſtrument that none but himſelf would have thought of? The conduct of the man who would not embrace the joyful opportunity with humble adoration of the ſovereign wiſdom that brought it to paſs, and cordial gratitude to the generous inſtrument, is a complication of iniquity:—it is hard to ſay whether the impiety or ſtupidity, the pride or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude of ſuch a demeanour has the aſcendant.</p>
            <p>PROP. VII. <hi>When a public reſtoration of God's people from the calamities of oppreſſion is to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, he uſually inſpires them with zeal proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to the work</hi>—the edict for enlarging the captive tribes no ſooner iſſues from the court at Babylon, than the joyful news is rung through all the ſtations of their confinement—the droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirits of that forlorn people, enervated by a ſervitude of ſeventy years, are animated at once, the languiſhing ſpark of patriotiſm is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly rekindled in every breaſt, and our eyes are immediately ſaluted with the ſight of forty two thouſand and upwards determined at all hazards, at the riſque of life and fortune, to regain the enjoyment of their country and liberties againſt whatever oppoſition may ſtand in the way: this was the work of the finger of God, Ezra i. 5. by which he prepared his way, for the ſtill more marvellous one that followed.</p>
            <p>THE cauſe of liberty is the cauſe of God: rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, truth, juſtice, religion mutually ſupport and are ſupported by it: of this cauſe heaven has been
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:016379_0017_0F9C70EC2C8DA3C0"/>
the patron in every age: he is incapable of chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his mind; the cauſe he has been wont to plead he will never deſert, he will work for it, and who ſhall lett him? when this ſtone is at the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nothing ſhall hinder the building to riſe.</p>
            <p>BUT the works of providence are done by means: they are ordinarily fitted before they are uſed—in a work of this kind every man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, and it is the duty of each to do what he can: no claſs or ſtation is unintereſted in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter—and none is exempted from the ſtrongeſt tyes to exert his utmoſt to have it accompliſhed —reſolution and fortitude are neceſſary to the taſk, and unanimity ſtrengthens the hands that perform it: therefore when God means to bring about ſo great an event, he uſually ſtirs up thoſe principles among the people for whoſe behoof it is deſigned: the conteſt among them is not who ſhall endure the leaſt difficulties—face the feweſt dangers—or ſuſtain the ſmalleſt loſs in the public cauſe; not who ſhall perform the leaſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices for the community, and reap the greateſt emoluments from it—not who ſhall realize the greateſt fortune, or ſecure the chief honors to himſelf and his friends. No! deteſted be the principles of conduct like this! ſhall the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany be reſpected as virtuous or wiſe, who all embarked in the ſame bottom, and perceiving themſelves on the point of foundering at ſea, ceaſe every endeavour for ſaving the ſhip, and get by the ears about ſharing the cargo? then, and then only, will reaſon and virtue agree to eſpouſe the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:016379_0018_0F9C70ECEE1057D8"/>
narrow purſuits of a private ſpirit in ſeaſons of public diſtreſs and danger.</p>
            <p>WHAT a contraſt to this was the ſpirit of the Jews in the ſtruggle deſcribed in this ſacred book! their only emulation appears to be who ſhall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play the greateſt exertions in the public cauſe— who ſhall contribute the moſt effectual aids— who ſhall offer the richeſt ſacrifice to the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the common weal.</p>
            <p>SEE! with what unanimity they purſue their plan! how cordially each works to the hand of the other! nor watching—nor building—nor fighting is ſhunned when the common cauſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it. Every man exerting his utmoſt for the good of the whole—and influencing all with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his reach to join their endeavors for effecting the purpoſe. Let the coward in America's quarrel—let the backward and lukewarm in the cauſe of the day—let the willing ſubject of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and the ſervant of ſelf, read over this hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory until the conſcious bluſh redden his cheek, and the line of his conduct be abandoned with ſhame.</p>
            <p>MAGISTRATES, and perſons of rank and truſt, ought to go foremoſt in aſſerting the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's freedom—theſe are appointed as fathers of the State, and guardians of the rights and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges of all its members: and ſhould ſuch men as they flee? Should they wink at the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the evil doer, who invades any right of the people for whom they rule, and neglect or refuſe to pluck from their boſom the folded

and lazy hand of their power to ſtrike due ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror on the impious aggreſſor—then do they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the chief part of their truſt: whenever they decline to put forth all their powers to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage and aſſiſt the exertions of their people in repelling the attacks of thoſe who would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure them, the very office they ſuſtain is the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of their conduct, and the honors heaped on them are become the reproach of the men who wear them: no longer ſhould they be re-regarded as the ordinance of God, than they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to be terrors to ſuch evil doers, and a praiſe and encouragement to them who, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feating their wicked intent, deſerve the character of having done well.</p>
            <p>NOR ſhould the miniſters of religion ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine themſelves excuſed by their office from bearing their part of the burden of the people in ſtruggles of ſuch importance as theſe: as watchmen ſet on the walls of Zion, it is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on them to give the alarm on the approach of every danger: as heralds from God we juſtly expect that, in times of public trial, they will not fail to blow his trumpet and proclaim his mandates—that they will cry aloud and not ſpare to ſhew to their people and to the world, yea to all ranks of men therein, where lies duty on the one hand and ſin on the other. Should magiſtrates with-hold from their people protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt the injuries of lawleſs perſons or States, and miniſters delay bearing teſtimony againſt them—or ſhould the people refuſe obedience to

the juſt calls of their rulers in matters indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to their own defence, and their public tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers by ſilence appear to connive at, or counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance their crime, do they not then make the tranſgreſſions of the reſt their own? and may not the conſequences be charged to their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count?</p>
            <p>PROP. VIII. Between civil liberties and thoſe of religion there is a near and neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion; when the one expires, the other cannot long ſurvive. When earth and hell conſpire againſt the former, their ultimate purpoſe is to ſtab the latter through that ſide: as religious reformations muſt generally open the door for the removal of civil diſtreſſes, ſo every ſtep in the ſtruggle for liberty ſhould be meaſured and governed by the rules of piety: ſucceſs in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which virtue abhors muſt not be counted a bleſſing—we cannot conclude the Lord on our ſide when we have avowedly joined his enemies.</p>
            <p>WHEN reſtoration of liberty has been obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the firſt thing to be attempted, is a total reform of every practice contrary to the laws of religion: this is the end of the people's deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erance—and when it is neglected, their founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion totters: to this the Jewiſh adventurers were immediately led on their return home by the ſame inſpiration that ſtirred them up to engage in the journey: no ſooner have they regained their city than we find them unanimouſly employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in rebuilding the altars and temple of God—

            <p>WORKS of this ſort therefore go heavily on unleſs magiſtrates and miniſters go hand in hand in it: when reſtoration is to be compleated, God ordinarily ſpirits up both theſe claſſes with fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent zeal for the cauſe of religion, thus Moſes and Aaron acted in concert—Zerubbabel and Joſhua ſtrengthened each other: thus Ezra and Nehemiah co-operated in the work when the Lord was about to render it perfect. See Neh. iii. 3, 28. and chap. iv. 16.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES indeed there are found amongſt the firſt ranks men of the ſame turn with the nobles of Tekoa Neh. iii. 5. who decline to put their necks to the work of the Lord. They cannot reſolve to riſque the frowns of the great —endanger their poſts of honor—their riches and poſſibly their perſons too for the ſake of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which they never prized—or to defend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion whoſe ſweets they never taſted: their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and profits they can better ſecure by the ruin than the recovery of the one, and their pleaſures might meet with diſturbance from the other. Such men become a heavy clog to the wheels of ſociety in perilous times: what damps will be caſt on the ſpirits of the people within the ſphere of their influence? but the example recorded in the text laſt cited, has pointed out from heaven a way to get rid of this dead-weight; the people with whom the original of all civil powers does

<pb n="26" facs="unknown:016379_0025_0F9C70F2ED34EBF8"/>
a freſh confirmation of the truth of religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the prophecies that had predicted the ſtorm could not without it have had their accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—and all theſe convulſions have been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the purpoſe of purging God's tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as thunder-ſtorms tend to purify air.</p>
            <p>CONTRARIES always illuſtrate each other— this oppoſition is a foil to let off the glory of the divine power that defeats it; the juſtice of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying God's enemies at laſt is magnified through the patience whereby he bore with them till then—hence the diſtreſſes of the people of God are often permitted to come to extremity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he appears for their relief—Iſaac is bound to the engine of death, the knife is taken, and the ſtroke drawn, before the angel arreſts the deſcending fate—the bricks are doubled e'er Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes is ſent—and the diſciples are ſinking when the Sovereign of the elements enters the ſhip: this enhances the mercy that helped at ſuch a time, and the goodneſs that ſupported through ſo great diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>OPPOSITION cannot then be ſaid to prove the badneſs of a cauſe nor the certainty of its failing: the want of oppoſition demonſtrates both: great oppoſitions beſpeak ſome great event in the birth —and in the cauſe of God the encouragement riſes as the violence that obſtructs it: ſince him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has aſſured us that all ſhall be overthrown at laſt— all made ſubſervient to the good of his Church—and turn out to be means of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it too: and in the confidence of this, the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:016379_0026_0F9C70F3AAA68C70"/>
friends of America need not be diſcouraged at the numbers, the power, the rage, or the deeds of the enemies of the great cauſe they plead— ſince they all preach the deliverance, the ſecurity and future glory of the land.</p>
            <p>THIS cauſe has ever been the great eye ſore of hell—the malice and power of internal legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have ever been bent againſt it: Satan's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are ever ready at his beck—hence wicked men of all claſſes naturally ſeek its overthrow: and when any ſuch are accidentally employed in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of it, we need never be at a loſs to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by their conduct, that they are preſſed into the ſervice by other motives than love to the cauſe itſelf—or any honeſt zeal to have it promoted.</p>
            <p>THE more effectually to obſtruct the work of reſtoration, it is uſual for Satan to collect his tools from different ranks—and different lands ſee Ezra iv. 4, 9, 10. The returning Jews ſoon found themſelves called to conflict with a colluvies of emigrants from various countries planted by the Babyloniſh tyrant as colonies of his vaſſals to ſupport his prerogative in every part of the land around them: the inferior herd of conſpirators againſt liberty are generally found to move on as they are ſpirited by the dependents on the throne—thus the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

the Tatnais, the Tobiahs whom the tyrant had made Governors in the land of Canaan, ever bearing a leading part. This may generally be expected when Governors are dependent for their office and ſupport on the mere will of a monarch; for then it is not unnatural to ſuppoſe the appointments will, of courſe, take place among ſuch as are known to have leſs zeal for the freedom and welfare of the people, than for the ſmiles of their maſter and the ſecurity of their place:</p>
            <p>UNDERSTRAPPERS never fail to ape the manners of their ſuperiors in office; when the Governors of the Provinces conſpire the ruin of the people under them, the Rehum's and Shim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhai's—the Commiſſioners of Cuſtoms, and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries of the Province, think they can never be too forward in their efforts for executing the project. Ezra iv. 7 8.</p>
            <p>ENEMIES <hi>without,</hi> receive their chief advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from the ſecret manaeuvres of foes <hi>within,</hi> as a traytor in the city will open the gates with twice the facility that the beſieger can force them: hence it is the policy of thoſe who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the deſtruction of the liberties of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if poſſible, to ſecure a party among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves who, under the maſk of friendſhip, will forward their meaſures, and embarraſs every ſtep taken in order to protract them: theſe, Proteus like, will put on various ſhapes accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to times: they will work themſelves into churches and councils—into armies and courts,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:016379_0028_0F9C70F5E843CCE0"/>
and pretend to enter with ſpirit into all the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the people, while they mean to fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the deſign of the whole, or to ſpy out and divulge what they cannot ſuppreſs; thus, Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das like, they ſtill dip in the diſh, and pretend to embrace whom they mean to betray: Such was the policy of Iſrael's foes, Ezra iv. 2. 'let us build with you (ſay they) for we ſeek your God as ye do' But a little acquaintance with mankind will lead us to diſcover, that they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into councils with Huſhai's intent: and the people of God, if guided by prudence, will boldly remove them from all ſhare in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and will not ſcruple to tell them, even to the face, as the fathers of Iſrael have ſet the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Ezra iv. 3. 'Ye have nothing to do with us to build an houſe unto our God.'</p>
            <p>WHETHER this precaution is taken or not, the conſpirators will leave no ſtone unturned to obviate every ſcheme for the public ſafety, and will alter their meaſures as the matter requires, as quickly as the Polypus changes its colour for that of the ſubſtance to which it adheres.</p>
            <p>IT will not be unprofitable to trace the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of this ſerpentine brood as we ſee them practiſed in the caſe of the Jews. At firſt they ſet out with evil ſurmiſings and advices to court, theſe are backed with bribes to the Counſellors and other officers in power, ſee Ezra iv. 4, 5. Then follow letter upon letter replete with their venom—falſe informations multiply apace, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations to the king ſtuff every packet, ſee ver.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:016379_0029_0F9C70F5F37683C8"/>
6—16. They forget not to trumpet their own loyalty to their maſter, and ſet up their zeal for his honor as their motive in all, ſee ver. 14. 'be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we have maintenance from the king's pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ace, and it was not meet for us to ſee the king's diſhonor, therefore have we ſent and certified the king'. They plead that his intereſt and rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enue is at ſtake, and all muſt be loſt if their tales be ſlighted, ſee verſe 13.16. 'if thou ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereſt the ſcheme of this people to ſucceed, then they will not pay toll, tribute, nor cuſtom, and by this means thou ſhalt have no portion on this ſide the river.</p>
            <p>REPRESENTATIONS like this obtain eaſy cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in the ears of monarchs—ſeldom do they fail to ſtand as ſufficient proof of the charge— and the accuſed, without tryal or hearing, are eaſily ſentenced; and ancient acts and obſolete ſtatutes are lugged into the cauſe to condemn the guiltleſs and dictate their doom. See verſe 15, 19. The ſtories of ſuch men are generally deemed ſufficient to produce new edicts from the reigning power, to cut off the people from every remaining privilege at once, ver. 21.22. —eagerly will the arbitrary mandates be put in execution by ſuch officers as procured them, ſo Rehum and Shimſhai poſted to Jeruſalem and ſtopped the work by force and power ver. 23. And what pity is it, that it muſt be confeſſed that the bulk of men are apteſt to ſhrink in the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt cauſe, are eaſily prevailed on to drop their exertions and quit the work with which all is at ſtake. See ver. 24.</p>

               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:016379_0030_0F9C70F6B514B308"/>THE prophets of God ought not then to be ſilent —faithfulneſs to their truſt will oblige them to engage with the openeſt boldneſs againſt ſuch tame ſubmiſſions, as idolatrous worſhip of arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power: and theſe are the men whom God often has choſen to rouſe and keep up among mankind the ſpirit of liberty and juſt defence. See Ezra v, 1, 2. chap. vi. 14.</p>
            <p>WHEN the people are thus animated to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per exertions, it is uſual with enemies of their cauſe to raiſe the cry of rebellion—breach of law —oppugnation of authority; and ſometimes they will proceed to take black liſts of names ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious and unpardonable who muſt be reſerved for proſcriptions, impriſonments, gibbets and racks: thus the miniſters of ſlavery dealt with the Jews Ezra v. 3, 4.</p>
            <p>BUT the friends of reſtoration will not thus be daunted; they can vindicate themſelves by law and argument and are ready to meet all their oppoſers on that ground, ſee verſe 11—17, and chap. vi. and vii.</p>
            <p>AT the entrance on a work ſo new and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tried, the firſt efforts of the people appear feeble and vain—the want of reſources, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience and ſkill, the deficiency of forces for their defence, the difficulties of raiſing and maintaining their armies, and the impatience of ſubordination, of fatigues and dangers natural to levies when firſt collected—theſe, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand other incidents that, at firſt ſetting out, the moſt wary community could not foreſee nor

prevent, will neceſſarily occaſion many blunders, delays, diſcouragements, and diſappointments in their moſt capital efforts:</p>
            <p>DISASTERS owing to any of theſe cauſes the enemy is no leſs eagle-eyed to diſcover, than cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to paint in moſt fearful colours,—then ſhall we ſee them diffuſing their poiſon in every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner—ever buzzing in the ears of the timid— their manifeſt weakneſs—the number of diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties—and greatneſs of dangers before them —their want of virtue and ability to perſevere —the length of time the conteſt muſt laſt—the power—numbers—and allies of the foe, &amp;c. &amp;c. —the minions of power will call them rebels— the paraſites of the tyrant will affect to ridicule their meaſures and look on their efforts as child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh and contemptible: in this ſtrain proceeded the oratory of Sanballat, Neh. iv. 3. 'What do theſe feeble Jews? will they fortify themſelves? will they ſacrifice? will they make an end in a day? &amp;c. Thus Tobiah and Geſhem keep each other in countenance, and raiſe the laugh at the pitiful efforts of the ſons of liberty, Neh. ii. 19. and pleaſe themſelves with the conceit that with an army of foxes they can ſtorm their fort, Neh. iv. 3.</p>
            <p>FEEBLE minds, with whom ridicule ſtands for a teſt of truth, may perhaps be diſmayed by the haughty tone in which court-ſycophants commonly talk, and ſome by indulging their gloomy fits may be led to give out, and ſit down in deſpair; even among the children of Judah
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:016379_0032_0F9C70F82ADD09A8"/>
could be found ſome little ſouls whom the loud laugh of their foes thunder-ſtruck: hark the moan of thoſe weakling creatures, Neh. iv. 10.</p>
            <p>NOT ſo the truly patriotic mind; every ſneer will be a mean to whet his zeal to a keener edge—theſe ſpurs will ſtimulate him to greater diligence and unwearied perſeverance that the cauſe may riſe into a light too reſpectable to be overſet by a puff of gaſconade; ſo did the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh patriots make advantage of the mirth of their foes, Neh. iv. 6.</p>
            <p>WHEN experience has convinced them that the wiſe are not to be bantered out of their wits, nor the virtuous brow-beaten into vicious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the luſt of power, more ſerious meaſures will be taken by the enemies of their liberty: the works of darkneſs are the moſt kindred means for their dark deſigns, adepts in the ſchool of wiley deceit are the tools beſt fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for a tyrant's purpoſe—practices of this complexion will ſoon be attempted: ſecret plots will be laid to ſurpriſe and kidnap honeſt abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the cauſe of God. Treacherous conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies will be formed to deprive the people of the means of defence, ſee Neh. iv. 7, 8—11. But prayer and caution, religion and induſtry, will effectually counterplot them and fruſtrate their ſchemes, ſee verſe 9—13—16.</p>
            <p>THE influence of religion being the greateſt weight in the ſcale of reſtoration, the enemy's gall will overflow on every occaſion they find of touching that ſubject—preachers will be railed

at as having deſerted their poſt, when they med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with politics—as having abandoned the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of peace when they juſtify defenſive war, as ceaſing to preach Chriſt, and preaching up NEHEMIAH: and through the powerful perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives in the hands of the great, ſome pulpits may be proſtituted to the venal drudgery of abetting a tyrant and promoting his cauſe. Neh. vi. 7, 10— 14.</p>
            <p>BRIBES will be tried to buy off the nobles, and it is not every one that has nobility enough to be proof againſt gold—ſhowers of that me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal have found their way through the ſtrongeſt roofs—ſoaked in this, the honor of ſome, even of Judah's chiefs, diſſolved and evaporated. The intelligence conveyed by their traiterous corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondences would have proved fatal to all plans of defence, had not the eye of Omniſcience de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected their plot in the fitteſt ſeaſon for ſaving his people, Neh. vi. 17,—19.</p>
            <p>THE leaders who diſdain fetters of gold as much as of iron, muſt not expect to eſcape the arrows of ſlander—all arts will be uſed to weaken their influence—ſly ſuſpicions will be inſtilled into the minds of the people, that their leaders are driving ſome evil deſign—that they only mean to raiſe themſelves into a degree of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and then mount the ſaddle and graſp the reins, or ſell the country and join the foe, Neh. vi. 6. To ſift theſe calumnies to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom would employ much time which cannot be ſpared from the great work in hand: to turn

the people aſide to this, and divert the main bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, was doubtleſs one of the enemy's ends— therefore if the wiſdom of heaven is the guide of our ſteps, we ſhall not ſtay to parley with the ſerpent, but anſwer his hints with a 'get thee behind me:' and, ſtopping our ears, we ſhall go on with our work. Neh. vi. 8.</p>
            <p>WHEN underhand meaſures will no longer avail, the gentleneſs of the lamb will ſoon be exchanged for the rage of the lion—the ruddy flag is hoiſted, and every ſentence breathes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but carnage and blood. The horrors of war are thundered in the ears of the people who are found too determined to barter their invalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rights away. See Neh. iv. 7, 8—11. But, if the genius of virtue inſpire the conteſt, tho' far from thirſting for enemies blood,—and deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deploring the neceſſity that drives them to have recourſe to arms, yet the people will remember that ſuch rights as man cannot reſign he is bound to defend at every hazard—that not to reſiſt is to join iſſue with the aggreſſor—is to partake in his guilt—and deſerve to ſhare in the doom that follows it:—that if the cauſe is God's, ſo alſo is the ſword that he puts in their hands for its defence, and ſo is the battle that decides its fate: and remembering theſe things, they will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that in ſuch a caſe, to ſhun the dangers of the field is to deſert the banner of Chriſt— and that the duties of the camp, at ſuch a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, are as truly religious as thoſe of the Church, —therefore undaunted by numbers, unmoved by

threats, the chriſtian patriot girds on the buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and with his life in one hand, graſps the ſword in the other, and thus calm and determined he enters the field and makes the laſt appeal to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>THOUGH the cauſe is the Lord's he will have it aſſerted by ordinary means—walls and towers —gates and bars—forts and armies are not leſs indiſpenſible than temple and ſacrifice, and when this work is begun it ſhould go on without pauſe —whilſt one breach in the rampart remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repaired—or one mean of defence is yet left un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tried Neh iv. 6.</p>

In that name alone muſt be repoſed all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of thoſe that fight: as well as of thoſe that called them to the field, the advantages reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the beſt inſtruments are to be conſidered only as helps from the fountain of might—con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed down to us in the channel of means that were appointed by himſelf:—therefore to the vigorous uſe of theſe muſt be joined conſtant prayer and truſt in God Neh iv. 9, 16—23.</p>
            <p>IF the efforts of the foe are baffled in war— their hopes diſappointed—their plots fruſtrate— and their fears confirmed that the buſineſs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration will at laſt be perfect, they will then make propoſals of negotiation—flattering will take place of threats—complaiſance will try

to recover what force could not atchieve: but if God is with them, the people will ſee the deſign of all to be their enſnaring—and that the kiſſes of Joab have daggers concealed—when with arms in their hands they call for a treaty, who can doubt that they mean to dictate the terms: ſo the fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erman curiouſly dreſſes his bait, whilſt a hook is concealed that ever proves fatal to the heedleſs fiſh that is pleaſed with it, the practice of Iſrael in a caſe like this, ſhould guide the conduct of ages to come: Nehemiah was repeatedly tried on this ſcore—and Nehemiah anſwered as patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots ought.

            <p>THUS Iſrael's efforts were almoſt defeated by ſelfiſh engroſſers that called themſelves friends; the poor reduced to the hard dilemma of ſtarving or mortgaging their all for bread, cried aloud in the ears of God and man—our children are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and we take up corn that they may live—our houſes and lands we pawn for it—and the dearth will quickly conſume them all, our ſons and our daughters are gone into bondage—nor is it in the power of our hands to redeem them—are we viewed by the public as bone of their bone —are our children conſidered as fleſh of their fleſh? Neh. v. 1—5.</p>

            <p>NEHEMIAH was led by the Spirit of God. And what were his meaſures in ſo great a tryal? They are kindly recorded for our example— you may hear them related in words of his own, Neh. v. 6—13. The patriot's anger was kindled againſt them—their crimes were cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by public rebuke, but his authority failing to influence them to their duty, the aſſembly of the people was called on the caſe—modern lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage would ſay <hi>Nehemiah headed a Mob!</hi> See ver. 7.—this remedy was a deſperate one it is true, but it was reſerved as it ought for a deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate caſe.</p>
            <p>MERE promiſes coming from unprincipled tongues could not appeaſe the popular fury: they were bound by an oath to ſurceaſe the crime, ver. 12. yea, compelled to reſtore their ill-gotten gains, ver. 11, 12. and the men who refuſed compliance with this, were disfranchiſed and held up as inveterate foes, ver. 13.

A cauſe thus important is not to be deſerted on account of a few repulſes in our way of ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it: to inhance our eſteem of eſtabliſhed liberty, the raging billows of ſome red ſea of danger, or the ſwelling waves of ſome Jordan of difficulty muſt commonly be paſſed in our way to it: thus Iſrael muſt march forty years in the deſart before they obtain the promiſed inheritance—and the Jews muſt encounter the arduous conflict for twelve years under Ezra's guidance, and as many more under the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Nehemiah before the work of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence was finiſhed: but when the people of God are refined as ſilver, he will bring them from the furnace without loſing any thing but their droſs: when their virtue is proved and their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience tried, and their long tribulations have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:016379_0040_0F9C70FE2BADCEF8"/>
their end, the Lord in mercy will finiſh the conflict; and in ſuch ways as wiſdom ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points, and often by means we leaſt regard, the common enemy will be repelled, the efforts of his people will be crowned with ſucceſs, and then LIBERTY AND INDEPENDENCE FIRMLY ESTABLISHED. Neh. vi. 51.</p>
            <p>PROP. XIII. <hi>When the great object is at last ſecured, even the enemies of it will be conſtrained to acknowledge the whole to be the work of God:</hi> even heathens would own a ſuperior power in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing an end which no oppoſition could fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, by means moſt unlikely in reaſon's eye, and from great part of which human prudence would preſage a contrary effect.</p>
            <p>THIS will highly glorify the irreſiſtible pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that ſupported the weak and vanquiſhed the mighty—the <hi>wiſdom</hi> which diſcovered the plots of the foe, and by men leſs verſed in politics than they, did timouſly turn their counſels into fooliſhneſs—the <hi>goodneſs and mercy</hi> which freed his church from a Pharaoh's power; and the <hi>juſtice</hi> that brought pride and wickedneſs to the ground—that let tyrants fall into their own pit—ſhews Haman's gibbet to be the tool of his fate, and beheads Goliah with his boaſted ſword.</p>
            <p>PROP. XIV, When a work like this is brought to an end, the effect deſcribed in the words of the text, unavoidably enſues to the enemies of it. How muſt they be confounded at the convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that all their exertions were fighting againſt God? How muſt their countenances fall and
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:016379_0041_0F9C724007321A20"/>
their hearts throb with vexation and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when all their utopian ſchemes have fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and themſelves, abandoned even by the part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of their guilt—deſpiſed by all, and unpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by moſt, are expoſed as the objects of univerſal deteſtation—and while the living vulture gnaweth within them, they outwardly furniſh the moſt contemptible inſtance of fallen pride, the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive ſpectacle of defeated ambition that can be beheld on this ſide of the pit.</p>
            <p>PROP. XV. <hi>Of a people delivered by the arm of the Lord the firſt care ſhould be to eſtabliſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Where this is wanting there can be no ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in the peace and liberty thus dearly bought. No right, no privilege is enjoyed ſecure: like a ſhip without rudder the community floats at the caprice of every wind that blows: the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending paſſions of individuals, like jarring ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments without a ballance, will ſoon reduce all to a ſtate of anarchy, and inſtead of a ſyſtem we behold a chaos. Tyranny itſelf is better than this: and whatever dangers they have eſcaped in avoiding that Scylla—the Charybdis of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion into which they are falling will not be leſs fatal to all that is dear: Iſrael groaned loudly under Pharaoh's ſway—yet they had not gone far in their journey from Egypt, till by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions of a murmuring party they were on the point of electing a leader to pilot them back to that houſe of bondage.</p>
            <p>IF religion and virtue being on their ſide en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged divine Providence to effect a people's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:016379_0042_0F9C7240B1176DB8"/>
from the jaws of ſlavery—virtue and religion ſhould not be forgotten when the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the enemy can hurt them no more: yet the intereſts of both, without a miracle, will languiſh and die in any nation where government ſets no guard upon them:</p>
            <p>TO ſet up the judgment of the magiſtrate as a teſt of truth in matters of conſcience and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion—this is an event we heartily deprecate— the very idea we conſider with horror: from this fruitful womb have ſprung all perſecutions—the moſt monſtrous births that have aſtoniſhed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind—and this principle admitted will juſtify them all. Truth has legs of her own on which ſhe travels, without any crutches of human eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhments. Religion has never been in more danger of degenerating into a raree-ſhew than when it ſubmitted to be modelled to the taſte of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>WHETHER civil government may be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to intermeddle in the affairs of the Church at all—and if ſo how far it may go—and where it muſt ſtop—are queſtions which fall not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my preſent province—and if they did, would be better referred to the more judicious deciſion of the honorable Convention who have it in charge to determine the matter.</p>
            <p>IT ſeems not unreaſonable however to expect that ſome line of diſtinction ſhould appear to be drawn between the duties of a body conſidered merely as a <hi>civil ſociety</hi>—and thoſe of a <hi>civil ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of chriſtians</hi>: if men are chriſtians while in a
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:016379_0043_0F9C7241840B33B8"/>
ſtate of nature, they will not ceaſe to be ſuch when they enter into the connexions of members of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety—their religion is a portable thing—they muſt carry it with them into every relation they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the world—religious men will therefore be found, religious magiſtrates and religious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, religious legiſlators, and religious executors of laws: the cords of love to God and man will equally bind them in every condition: the ſuppreſſion of vice and impiety, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and ſupport of religion and virtue will be their grand aim in every character: if a number of individuals of this temper were to aſſociate into one community, and form a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution for the government of it in the preſent and all ſucceeding ages—and in that platform ſhould diſcover no ſymptom of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and a ſociety of pagans or infidels —not a mark of diſtinction between them and atheiſts, generations to come would be led to ſuſpect that on entering ſociety they had laid down their profeſſion.</p>
            <p>NOR can ſuch a meaſure be reconciled to the principles of ſound policy more eaſily than to the genius of the chriſtian religion: virtue and piety are nearly connected—married by heaven, no man can divide them—where impiety reigns virtue is baniſhed, and when ſhe takes her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture the community has loſt the ſureſt guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of public ſafety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſecurity of the body is the government's charge—that can never be had where the reins are laid on the neck of

men's luſts, and immoralities are under no pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic reſtraint —the ſyſtem of laws that affixes no penalty to theft, adultery, murder, and the like enormities, is juſtly regarded as deſignedly opening the wideſt door for undoing the State: nor is it eaſy to ſay why theſe ſhould be puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whilſt blaſphemy and profaning the name of God—whilſt public mockery of his word, his day and his worſhip, enjoy the ſanction of a public licence; and for ought that appears, may plead the ſhelter of legal eſtabliſhment. It is hard to inveſtigate any ingredient in the acts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained more truly pernicious, than is the whole nature of thoſe that go free, unleſs we conclude that the firſt table of God's law is not as bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and authoritative as the ſecond—or that obedience to the one exculpates the breaches of the other, or that killing the body is a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter crime than deſtroying the ſoul; or in a word, that every member may be ruined and the community ſafe.</p>
            <p>HOW far the conduct of Jews ſhould paſs for a precedent in civil concerns, I preſume not now to enquire or determine: I am not inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that the coming of the ſubſtance has freed us from obligation to obſerve the ſhadow— things that were typical of Chriſt and his work muſt needs expire when that work was finiſhed, but whether the civil and judicial departments were, no leſs than the religious, filled up with matters purely typical may perhaps admit of ſome debate: if the inſpired examples recorded among
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:016379_0045_0F9C7242EB6DAD00"/>
them are, not only the language of revelation, but the plain dictate of the law of nature too, I ſee not why in ſimilar caſes they ſhould not be adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in every age; and if they may in the caſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us they will enforce the eſtabliſhing of a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment whoſe aim ſhall be to guard the public ſafety Neh. chap. xi. by ſecuring the obſervance of the law of God—and maintaining the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ordinances of religion in all the purity of their firſt appointment ſee chap. i. 7, 8, 9 — by breaking off for ever all connexion with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and open enemies alike chap, xiii. ver 23 —28 and bringing all traitors to condign pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment Neh xiii. 4—9. and the execution of the plan ſhall begin with a public thankſgiving for the good obtained —a ſolemn dedication of our all to God—and the erection of monuments of our deliverance which ſhall remain undefaced in ages to come.

               <p>THE length to which this ſubject has drawn itſelf out, makes it unſeaſonable now to purſue one half the improvement which it might afford. He that is verſed in the hiſtory of the State we live in, will not need to be told that the privileges mentioned in prop. 4. were enjoyed by its inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants from their firſt ſettlement, under fifteen Governors, down to the memorable days of Androſs——that, intoxicated by proſperity, we ſadly declined in every attainment of religion and virtue; and that, though this declenſion

received a check by a remarkable effuſion of the Spirit of Grace, and was frequently threatned with partial ſtrokes, yet the defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion begun made alarming progreſs until gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral calamity burſt on our heads in that entering wedge of tyranny—the American Stamp-Act. From that day to this we have clearly ſeen that the deſign of the Court was to cruſh and enſlave: for even the Act which prohibits the exerciſe— is ſucceeded by another which aſſerts the right of the Britiſh legiſlature to bind the Colonies in all caſes whatſoever:—to get this claim recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by ourſelves, ſome trifling duties were at firſt demanded: and it was the aſtoniſhment of all the world—to ſee a people ſo divided in intereſt and prejudice ſo generally united in a firm reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to mar, at all hazards, the chain in the forge.—We were challanged to diſpute on the merits of the cauſe—we found a champion in the reſpectable FARMER who routed our foes on their own ground: and when the Sanballat of the time renewed the onſet—the General Court took up the gauntlet and out ſhot that Rabſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keh in his own bow.</p>
               <p>IT cannot be denied that many of the chief characters in every State have followed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the Nobles of Tekoa—and hence the people, deprived of the counſel of their former guides, were compelled, in many places, to throw themſelves into the arms of leaders equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced in the arts of policy as in the ſcience of war: hence it will not be wondered if our

firſt efforts were weak and fumbling; and if ſome low minds fainted at knowledge thereof:—the means of defence ſeemed far out of reach—till the duſt of the earth ſupplied ammunition—the ſinews of war appeared totally wanting, till worn out rags became ſilver and gold—when our fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries were cut off we anxiouſly ſaw our ſtaple demoliſhed, but to our ſurprize the ſame power that brought ſhoals to Peter's net conducted the fiſh to our harbours and wharves, and turned the waves that laſhed our ſhores into ſalt when we needed it, to preſerve them—the ſtatutes which menaced a general famine by ſtopping the acceſs of foreign ſupplies were unable to bottle the clouds of heaven—or divert the kind influence of the beams of the ſun.</p>

               <p>BY theſe have the arts already deſcribed (prop. x) been tried with like ſpirit and like effects —they have cried out rebellion—they have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken black liſts—have proſcribed and executed in idea the men they imagined to ſtand moſt in their way.</p>
               <p>THE miniſters of religion have been generally hearty in the public cauſe: our enemies were not inſenſible that their faithful teſtimony put life in the meaſures uſed in its ſupport—and therefore their perſons—their names—and religion—and the ſacred places where God's worſhip was fixed —became the principal butt of the keeneſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of America's foes:</p>
               <p>WHILST a Eugene and Marlborough—a Guſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavus and Frederic—an Alexander and Caeſar as a conſtellation of heroes, have conſpired to join their brightneſs together to illuminate the hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere of the eaſtern continent—the ſingular care of Iſrael's God has reſerved it for the glory of this weſtern world to give riſe and motion to a ſtar of her own whoſe luſtre eclipſes the beams of them all. Commanders that need not fear compariſon with the heroes of antiquity, we ſee to be the produce of every State.

               <p>WHEN the enemy's hopes were in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith—that the cauſe of freedom was cruſhed in embryo—that our ſpirits were ſunk, and our nerves unſtrung—and all our reſiſtance was come to a period: He who ſitteth in heaven did laugh and by one touch of his finger, at Saratoga, did daſh the preſumptuous joy to the ground.</p>
               <p>THE chief wonder of all is yet to be told— In the magnanimity of the generous MONARCH OF FRANCE Heaven has brought on the ſtage the CYRUS of the church in goſpel-times—a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like his riſe—his inſpiration alike—the ſame his conduct and the ſame its effect: whilſt the reſt of the world ſtood aloof and looked on—and Proteſtant powers, once in the ſame caſe, like the prieſt and Levite ſhunned our cries—behold the Samaritan haſtes to our help—our wounds are ſoftened by his wine and his oyl, whilſt his treaſure is laviſhed to finiſh our cure: does the bigot give credit to the tory's tale—and dream it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful to accept ſuch aid? ſo might Iſrael have ſpurned the Perſian's offer and the temple of God ſtill remained in rubbiſh! gratitude and piety will not ſtand and gaze—both will unite to improve the favor—while the example of each prompts the other to cry 'this is the Lord's doing and wondrous in our eyes.'</p>

               <p>THE ſpirit of Sanballat breathed in all their overtures—to amuſe the world and gain time for their preparations—and thereby to draw us into a ſnare, at a time when no earthly friend ſhould be near enough to ſtretch forth a hand to pull us out: that theſe were the inſidious deſigns of their parliamentary conceſſions—miniſterial motions —phantaſtic commiſſions—and 'flying rolls' we may eaſily ſee, if with them we compare the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manoeuvres practiſed, at the ſame time, to give them ſucceſs:—the bribing the Savages of the wood to butcher the naked inhabitants of our frontiers—and hiring the negroes of our families to embrue their hands in the blood of the houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds that gave them their food—that the gold, deſigned to be freely laviſhed in ſeducing our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots from their duty, might not return like the men who brought it, deſpiſed and rejected by all ſorts of mankind here:—the counterfeiting our medium, and diſperſing in every part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,

emiſſaries according to their own heart, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in debaſing and deſtroying its credit:— theſe, conjoined with the deeds of heroiſm where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Britiſh arms were ſignalized in the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts of the land through which they paſſed, and by which too their brave commanders rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped laurels immortal—in the ſack of defenceleſs villages—the reducing to aſhes every building they could find that was dedicated to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Iſrael's God—in the plundering of hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes—ſtealing of live-ſtock, and in abuſing and frighting the child and the mother who could not eſcape——all—all conſpire to aſſiſt us in ſpelling out the meaning of their language of love.</p>
               <p>THROUGH the merciful hand of our God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us the arms and the arts of our open foes have been hitherto baffled and defeated—the little checks we have ſometimes met with in a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine hour—were but juſt enough to keep us awake—as cautions from heaven of the ſame kind which Iſrael of old had from the Amorite, that, for that very purpoſe, were continued in the land —leſt the people ſhould forget, or be exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove meaſure—every one of them has been ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and ſerviceable too—and whenever they threatened to proceed too far, the finger of God has turned the ſcale:</p>
