         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN men ſee a new book, 'tis natural for them to enquire the occaſion of its appearance, eſpecially now when the world is ſo full of them. The requeſt of friends is a common excuſe, and may truly be alledged here; yet that is not the chief motive. And what encouragement can the preſent face of things give to ſuch a work as this? For the language of bookſellers in our country for ſome years has born a near reſemblance to that of one deſcribed in the <hi>London</hi> Magazine for <hi>April</hi> 1763. Who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to print a poem, becauſe the ſubject was too moral and religious; and ſaid,
<q>
                  <l>"Had your poem been garniſh'd with modiſh chit chat,</l>
                  <l>How Fanny ſaid this, and how Cloe did that;</l>
                  <l>Lac'd with baudry and ſmut, had you publiſh'd a play,</l>
                  <l>I could ſell off two thouſand at leaſt the firſt day.</l>
                  <l>For whate'er you may fancy, you live in an age,</l>
                  <l>When the church do not pay half ſo well as the ſtage;</l>
                  <l>Dear Doctor, tho' ſkill'd both in Hebrew and Greek,</l>
                  <l>You had much better preach for five Shillings a week</l>
                  <l>Than publiſh ſuch verſe—for whatever is in't,</l>
                  <l>If <hi>ſerious,</hi> it ne'er pays for paper and print".</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:010549_0004_0F806BB8F52A88E0"/>Yet (ſtrange as it may ſeem) a heart affecting view of this deep ſleep which we are fallen into, is the principle motive to this attempt, towards ſtiring ſouls up to a living and practical regard to divine truth: The neglect whereof has brought this lethergy upon us. And while it was coming on, various things have diverted our minds from a ſenſe of our danger. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times our thoughts were prying into <hi>futurities,</hi> to the neglect of <hi>preſent</hi> living unto God; and then every thing that could be met with of a <hi>prophetical</hi> nature was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed and ſpread: Not only ſuch as were ſerious cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations or conjectures from ſcripture, but alſo ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic viſions and dreams. At other times, witty or angry <hi>controverſy</hi> employed our minds in various ſhapes: yea, inſtead of living by faith as we ought, many have contended (as hard as <hi>Job</hi> and his friends did) about what <hi>faith is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I believe <hi>counſel</hi> has been <hi>darkned with words without knowledge,</hi> as much in <hi>this</hi> controverſy as in <hi>that.</hi> As long as <hi>Job</hi> view'd God in all that befel him, he did not <hi>ſin with his lips;</hi> but when he tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to diſpute with his friends, each party miſapplied excellent truths, and retorted their miſtaken concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons till their ſpirits were wearied out: yet when the Lord appeared he made them all aſham'd of their conduct; and doubtleſs his appearance now would have the ſame effect upon ſome of our late diſputants. The neglect of right conduct in many who have made great profeſſions of faith, has given occaſion for the builders on works to exert themſelves afreſh; and the writings of a religious nature which have had the moſt current ſpread in this land for ſome years paſt, were ſuch as, under a pretence of promoting morality and good order, have been levelled againſt many of the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010549_0005_0F806BBB2EA8BF78"/>
peculiar doctrines of chriſtianity; yea ſome of them even againſt the true deity of its great author.</p>
            <p>In the mean time we have one <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Robert Sandeman,</hi> who came from <hi>Scotland</hi> in autumn 1764. and after travelling into various parts of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try he gathered a church at <hi>Portſmouth;</hi> but that was ſcattered laſt fall, and he has a ſmall ſociety now in <hi>Boſton.</hi>
               </note> who makes a ſhew of appearing for thoſe great doctrines, and to ſtir people up to look into them, that yet has artfully mixed ſuch a <hi>potion,</hi> as tends to ſettle men in a dead ſleep. And ſince his writings have been a means of hardning ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in iniquity, and of entangling or perplexing ſome ſerious minds, I ſhall attempt to point out ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious principles, which he has interſperſed among many choice truths.</p>
            <p>He has ſet down a charming deſcription, of the Apoſtle's manner of preaching in theſe terms, viz. <q>As they exhibit no allurements to the paſſions of men; ſo neither do they enter into any parly of capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation with his preſumptuous reaſonings; but ſtorming and demoliſhing theſe, they preſs forward to his conſcience, charge him before God, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him there. They clear up, and preſent in a ſtriking view before him, the half defaced rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of duty, naturally imprinted in his heart, and ſhew at once, how unſutable to them his thoughts and actions have been. They unſhakle his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and make it ſpeak out, and, with the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt demonſtration, enforce every thing it ſpeaks. And while they ſhut up all his imagined ſources of light and hope, they furniſh him with a ſupernatural reaſon of hope ſtamped with the divine character.<note n="†" place="bottom">Letters on Theron and Aſpacio 3 Editon Vol I. page 226.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:010549_0006_0F806BBBC1EF21E8"/>Such fine paſſages as this, will induce ſome to take down all that ſuch a writer ſays, almoſt wishout exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. But if we obſerve the divine caution, <hi>Take heed what you hear,</hi> we may ſoon find things of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther nature; for the Apoſtles are dead, and this writer has raiſed a ſtately monument for them, and inſcribed thereon, PAUL'S GOSPEL. And now he will not allow any man to call himſelf Chriſt's <hi>ambaſſador,</hi> and to <hi>beſeech</hi> ſouls in <hi>Chriſt's ſtead to be reconciled to God:</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20.</note> and for no better reaſon that I can find than this, viz. that many have abuſed that character ſince the Apoſtle's days. <note n="†" place="bottom">See Letters Vol. I. page 45. &amp;c.</note> Therefore now when one miniſter ſays to his hearers, <q>Let me tell you, the Lord hath ſent me at this time to <hi>proclaim liberty to the captives</hi> that are in this ſad, bitter, and (to their thinking) deſperate condition; liberty God hath given thee, if thou wilt come freely; nothing in the world ſhall hinder thee.</q> This author ſays that in this paſſage, "His lofty ſelf conceit may be ſeen". And when another miniſter expoſtulates with his hearers thus, <q>Can none of my exhortations, none of my friendly intreaties prevail with you to <hi>rouſe up,</hi> and look into your own hearts, and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your ſtate and condition</q> &amp;c. This man cries <q>obſerve with what dignity this gentleman <hi>ſtruts</hi> in his pulpit.</q> 
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Letters Vol. 2. page 203, 204, 208.</note> And he concludes his book with this advice to his readers, viz. <q>After you have heard the orthodox ſo plainly affirming, that juſtification is an act of God's free grace,—ſuffer them not to put the change upon you. Whenever they begin to talk to you of any act you are to exert in order
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010549_0007_0F806BBC54681B18"/>
to acceptance, and call it a juſtifying act, which you are to exert by the help of God's grace, be you ready to reply, Avaunt; none of your tricks! If you would preach goſpel to us, you muſt tell us ſomething fit to give us joy as we preſently ſtand unconſcious of any diſtinguiſhing qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here reader, only look back to his deſcription of the Apoſtle's way of preaching the goſpel, and judge for thyſelf, if he does not teach ſinners to <hi>gainſay</hi> juſt ſuch preaching now as they delivered, when they <q>preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed forward to the ſinners conſcience, charged him before God, and converſed with him there; and ſhut up all his imagined ſources of light and hope</q> while they called him to <hi>believe in the Lord Jeſus and ye ſhall he ſaved:</hi> yea he teacheth them to reſiſt ſuch preachers now as they would the devil, by crying, "Avaunt! none of your tricks"!</p>
            <p>It is readily granted that this writer has pointed out many dark ſtrokes in the writings of our moſt noted divines; and if he could clear off all their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, he ſhould be as welcome thereto, as any <hi>crow</hi> could be to take all the <hi>carrion</hi> out of our pleaſant fields; but who would abandon their fruitful fields, becauſe ſome crow's meat was found there? Yet he bends all his wit this way; for after naming Mr. <hi>Flavel,</hi> the <hi>Erſkine's</hi> and many others, under the name of <hi>popular preachers,</hi> he ſays, <q>I would be far from refuſing even to the popular preachers themſelves, what they ſo much grudge to others, the benefit of the one inſtance of an hardned ſinner finding mercy at laſt: For I know of no ſinners more hardened, none greater deſtroyers of mankind than

they.<note n="*" place="bottom">Letters on Theron &amp;c. Vol. 2 page 138.</note>
               </q> And afterwards, ſpeaking of the writings of Meſſirs. <hi>Guthrie, Marſhal, Boſton</hi> and <hi>Doddridge,</hi> he ſays, <q>If any profane Perſon, who deſires to be converted, ſhall take pains to enter into the ſpirit of theſe books, it will be eaſy to ſhew, from the new-teſtament, that he thereby becomes two-fold more the child of hell than he was before<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid page 191.

               </q> And he tells Mr. <hi>P.</hi> that he was "particularly fond" of theſe two paſſages; <q>Not (ſays he) that theſe paſſages contain <hi>any thing</hi> but what is <hi>aimed at</hi> in every page.</q> Thus we happen to have his own account of what he <hi>aimed at</hi> thro' all his writings, even againſt ſuch as he allows do plainly enough ſet before "us <hi>many</hi> articles of the apoſtolic doctrine".

               </q> Now compare this with what he ſays of others: <q>Many, ſays he, truſting in themſelves, that they are more eminently godly than others, look down with a ſolemn pride on the reſt of mankind.—Many have their pride not a little gratified, by <hi>complaining</hi> of the <hi>defections</hi> of the church whereof they are members.</q> Yet there is ſcarce one <hi>proteſtant</hi> author that he names without <hi>complaining</hi> of his <hi>defections;</hi> and where he could find nothing to <hi>complain</hi> of, he conceals their names; for he ſays, <q>I have as I found occaſion, freely adopted the obſervations, and even the words of the friends of the doctrine contained in theſe ſheets, without ſeeing any neceſſity of quoting them
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010549_0009_0F806BBD80B15E40"/>
or mentioning their names.</q> But why not their names on one ſide as well as the other? Why he ſays <q>There was no attacking the popular doctrine to any purpoſe, without making an <hi>honeſt</hi> eſſay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards profaning the divinity of thoſe demi-gods<note n="*" place="bottom">Letters Vol. 2 page 245, 246.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now my dear friends, behold! this man is ſo <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> that he exclaims aloud againſt every bodies <hi>pride</hi> but <hi>his own!</hi> and he is ſo <hi>honeſt</hi> that he exerts all his wit to expoſe the <hi>nakedneſs</hi> of <hi>proteſtant fathers;</hi> but adopts their <hi>good obſervations,</hi> while he conceals their names that they may paſs for his own!</p>
            <p>Yet he would not have us think that he is moved to this conduct by the <hi>prejudices</hi> of <hi>education;</hi> becauſe he tells us he was trained up from his infancy under ſuch teaching, and long ſought to form his heart thereby: <q>But, ſays he I am far from thinking I ſay any thing extravagant, or in the leaſt injurious to my conſcience, when I affirm, that I might have been as profitably employed, and even with as much chriſtian piety, in attending the levee of the lady of Loretto.</q> Vol. 1 page 121.</p>
            <p>Here obſerve, <hi>Loretto</hi> is a city in <hi>Italy,</hi> where <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> ſay they have the <hi>holy houſe</hi> that the virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was born in, which they pretend was carried through the air from <hi>Gallilee</hi> by angels:— therefore many thouſands yearly reſort there, to pay their devotions to the <hi>Ladies</hi> image, with the infant on her arm. <note n="†" place="bottom">Univerſal Gazeteer at the word Lorotto.</note> So that he had as good have ſaid, <q>There is are profitable means to promote chriſtian piety in attending the worſhip of the virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> in the depths of <hi>popery,</hi> as there are under ſuch tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers as Mr. <hi>Boston,</hi> the <hi>Erſkins</hi>'s &amp;c.</q>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:010549_0010_0F806BBE4E6C2F38"/>Let this be kept in mind, and we will turn and enquire what more profitable means are to be had under his teaching. If we aſk how a ſoul comes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in Chriſt, his reply is that <q>Faith comes not by human endeavours, or the uſe of <hi>any means,</hi> even under the <hi>greateſt</hi> advantages that men <hi>can</hi> enjoy.</q> But ſays he, <q>The conveyance of the ſalutary truth to them for their relief, as much prevents <hi>every motion</hi> of their will,—as did the divine gracious purpoſe before the world was.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Letters Vol. 2 page 67.136.</note> Now what can have a more natural tendency to guard againſt a ſenſe of the guilt of unbelief, than this has? to illuſtrate his meaning he ſays, <q>Let us learn from the words of Jeſus, how infants at the beginning of Life, and how condemned fellons at the end of it, enter into the kingdom of God.

            <p>In order to eſtabliſh his notion of theſe two caſes, he puts a falſe conſtruction upon others ſentiments concerning them. As to the firſt, he ſpeaks of ſome <hi>diſſenters,</hi> and afterwards of Dr. <hi>Gill</hi> by name, whom he repreſents as holding that adult perſons are intitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to baptiſm, and ſo to the kingdom of Heaven on account of ſomething which they <hi>can do</hi> more than infants towards <hi>obtaining</hi> a part therein. <note n="§" place="bottom">Letters Vol. 2 page 41 205.</note> Whereas that controverſy is not concerning what any can do towards <hi>obtaining,</hi> but 'tis about <hi>manifeſting</hi> their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the kingdom. We have no account who the parents of them children were which were brought to Jeſus, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.13, 14. Neither does
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010549_0011_0F806BBEF5078020"/>
he ſay <hi>all ſuch,</hi> but <hi>of ſuch</hi> is the kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> holds that <note n="*" place="bottom">Epiſtolory Coreſpond. page 30.</note> 
               <q>juſtification comes to a parent, and his houſe at the ſame time; and ſays, The parent then believing, according to what is ſpoken, is juſtified together with his houſe.</q> If this were true, it would prove that parents <hi>can do</hi> a great deal for others, if not for themſelves. The text he refers to for the ſupport of this notion, aſſerts fully that the <hi>word</hi> was <hi>ſpoken to all that were in</hi> the jailor's houſe, and that <hi>all rejoiced believing in God,</hi> as it does that <hi>all</hi> were <hi>baptized,</hi> Act. 16.31—34. None ſpeaks more plainy againſt <hi>national churches</hi> than this author pretends to do; yet how vain are all ſuch pretences, while he holds things thus? For all know that families are the foundation of nations: the old <hi>national church</hi> all ſprang from one eminent believer.</p>
            <p>Upon the other caſe viz. the <hi>thief on the croſs,</hi> he takes ſome paſſages from Meſſirs. <hi>Flavel, Boſton,</hi> and <hi>Williſon;</hi> wherein they warn ſouls againſt <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting</hi> the <hi>great ſalvation</hi> becauſe of that inſtance of one who found mercy at the laſt: and becauſe they ſay, that was an <hi>extraordinary</hi> time, ſuch as will not happen again, and that the thief never had an offer of grace before. This author, catching at ſuch expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>metamorphoſeth</hi> their diſcourſe, till he would make their meaning to be <q>That the pardoned ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner had extraordinary merit, namely, of the nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive kind, yea, that he had within him a very live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpark of goodneſs;</q> and ſtrains it even to this, that, <q>extraordinary mercy was, upon an extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary occaſion, ſhewn to extraordinary worth.<note n="†" place="bottom">Vol. 2 p 46, 47.</note>
               </q> And having changed their meaning in ſuch a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manner, he then compares them to <hi>Proteus,</hi> who,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010549_0012_0F806BC1360C9BE0"/>
the <hi>poets</hi> ſaid would <hi>change his ſhape at his pleaſure.</hi> And then brings in ſome of the moſt falſe ſentiments he could find on that ſubject; and ſo ſpends <hi>eighteen</hi> pages, and all to try to make out his poſition, <q>That the deity makes little account of our thoughts thro' all the buſy ſcene of life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Yet Jehovah calls the <hi>heavens</hi> and <hi>earth</hi> to <hi>give ear</hi> to what he <hi>hath ſpoken,</hi> becauſe his people <hi>doth</hi> not CONSIDER Iſai. 1.2, 3. The reaſon this man gives why theſe divines cannot mean right, is that it can never do to ſay, a perſon delays believing a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny now, in hopes of finding it to be true hereafter: and ſo ridicules the notion of men's delaying their faith. But God's word informs us that when <hi>Felix</hi> heard <hi>Paul concerning the faith in Chriſt;</hi> ſo that truth made him <hi>tremble,</hi> and his immediate anſwer was, <hi>go thy way for this time.</hi> And as we are expreſly told that <hi>faith comes by hearing;</hi> ſo the danger of <hi>neglecting</hi> it, is often warned againſt in theſe terms, <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice hardned not your hearts.</hi> And though he treats them with contempt for holding forth that the thief had not outſtood ſuch calls as preſumptuous ſinners now do! yet <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>I obtained mercy becauſe</hi> I ſinned IGNORANTLY, <hi>in unbelief.</hi> 1 Tim. 1.13.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time this writer would be ſo far, from being accounted an enemy to good works, that he gives it as <hi>Paul</hi>'s mind, intimated to true Chriſtians, <q>that they could not warrantably be aſſured of their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſtate by any exerciſe or mind, without the ſelf denied <hi>works</hi> of obedience.</q> And he takes pains to diſtinguiſh between the aſſurance of faith, and the aſſurance of hope, and refers the firſt to the <hi>truth</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, the other to our <hi>intereſt</hi> therein. And he ſays, <q>No man can be charged with the ſin of diſbelieving the goſpel for <hi>doubting</hi> if he be a good Chriſtian:
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010549_0013_0F806BC24BB158E0"/>
his chief hazard lies on the other ſide.</q> Of the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of faith he ſays, <q>They obtain it without their uſing any endeavours in ſearch of it:— whereas the aſſurance of hope is enjoyed <hi>only</hi> by thoſe who give all diligence to obtain it.<note n="*" place="bottom">Letters Vol. 2 page 140, 141.</note>
               </q> Now compare this with his eſſay to detect others <hi>artifice,</hi> in confoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding grace and works together, where he ſays, <q>Muſt we not ſay, that all the good works which ſhall be recompenced at the reſurruction of the juſt, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the influence of the divine Spirit dwelling in the hearts of thoſe who believe? yet ſuch is the connection betwixt every good work and its reward, that according to ſcripture, the <hi>juſtice</hi> of God, not to ſay his <hi>grace,</hi> is concerned to make it good.<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid page 96.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Were this true then, he that gives all diligence to perform the <hi>ſelf denied works of obedience,</hi> and ſo obtains the <hi>aſſurance of hope;</hi> God's <hi>juſtice,</hi> not to ſay his grace, would be concerned to <hi>reward</hi> him for thoſe <hi>good works</hi> at the <hi>reſurrection of the just.</hi> Whereas according to the goſpel, <hi>juſtice</hi> is as much concerned to <hi>forgive</hi> the penitent, and to <hi>cleanſe</hi> him from all <hi>unrighteouſneſs,</hi> as to reward his good works: 'Tis all thro' <hi>grace</hi> in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9. <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3, 4.</p>
            <p>Tho' this author abounds with <hi>criticiſm,</hi> yet this, and other ſcriptural <hi>diſtinctions</hi> he labours to explode. As, 1. The diſtinction between <hi>doctrinal</hi> and <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental</hi> knowledge; between right <hi>notions</hi> of truth in the <hi>head,</hi> and <hi>knowing</hi> them in the <hi>heart.</hi> When Mr. <hi>P.</hi> had profeſſed a full concurrence with his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents concerning faith, and then made an attempt to explain his difinition of it, as <q>a <hi>bare</hi> belief of the <hi>bare</hi> report of the goſpel,</q> ſo as to make it
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010549_0014_0F806BC2BA9158E0"/>
mean more <q>than what is commonly called <hi>ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, notional,</hi> or <hi>dead</hi> faith:</q> Mr. <hi>S.</hi> replys, that "any attempt to render my language on this head leſs offenſive, is enough to alarm me and awaken "ſuſpicion". Epiſt. Correſpond. page 62<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And tho' Mr. <hi>P.</hi> expreſſed his thankfulneſs for the help he had received from our author's writings to <hi>clear his views,</hi> and <hi>relieve his mind;</hi> yet becauſe he adds his perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that he had, <q>truely known and preached, truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and loved the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for many years,</q> and therefore could not join in his <hi>ſeverity</hi> againſt other <hi>preachers</hi> and <hi>writers;</hi> Mr. <hi>S.</hi> tries hard to detect Mr. <hi>P.</hi> of <hi>hypocriſy,</hi> and concludes that there <hi>muſt be</hi> ſome <hi>defect</hi> or <hi>miſtake</hi> in his faith, tho' he could not <hi>pretend</hi> to <hi>point out</hi> wherein it lay, p. 61. But if this diſtinction was excluded, how would it ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the <hi>deiſts</hi> when they hear Jeſus declare to his diſciples that they <hi>knew,</hi> what they aſſerted that they did <hi>not know; Joh.</hi> 14 4—9. The glory of God in the face of Chriſt had ſhined into their <hi>heart,</hi> tho' they had not as yet, diſtinct notions thereof in their <hi>heads.</hi> And tho' they truly believed in him as the <hi>way to the Father, yet they knew not the ſcripture, that he muſt riſe again from the dead,</hi> John 20.9. But after he aroſe, he <hi>opened their underſtandings,</hi> ſo that they could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly and boldly preach the <hi>forgiveneſs of ſins,</hi> to <hi>Jews</hi> who are gathered from <hi>among all nations</hi> Luk. 24.45.—47. Act. 2. Yet ſtill it was a long time before they had ſo much head knowledge as to preach this goſpel freely to the <hi>gentiles.</hi> All which ſhews that diſtinct notions in the head, and a knowing the truth in the heart are quite different things.</p>
            <p n="2">2 Mr. <hi>S.</hi> makes no juſt diſtinction between a <hi>ſlaviſh</hi> and a <hi>child like fear,</hi> but labours to confound them together. He declares that no fixed judgment
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010549_0015_0F806BC385F0B8B0"/>
can be formed of <hi>any</hi> man's ſtate, but a patient con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in <hi>well doing to the end.</hi> 
               <q>No mortal, ſays he, can attain any ſuch aſſurance of hope but that he ſtill finds himſelf occaſionally in hazard of loſing it.</q> page 85. And he aſſerts that, one <q>can ſcarce do a greater hurt to profeſſors, than by indulging them in the thought that they are at bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom poſſeſſed of ſome inherent <hi>good principle.</hi>
               </q> 
               <q>A teacher, ſays he, runs no riſk of exceeding in urging the motives to <hi>fear.</hi>
               </q> page 92. But <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, ye have not received the ſpirit of <hi>bondage again to fear:</hi> And <hi>Zacharias</hi> bleſſed God that Chriſt would deliver us from our enemies, ſo that we might <hi>ſerve him</hi> WITHOUT FEAR, <hi>in holineſs and righteouſneſs before him, all the days of our life, Rom.</hi> 8.15. <hi>Luk</hi> 1.74.75.</p>
            <p>Now I defy him or any other man to reconcile theſe matters, without carefully diſtinguiſhing between that <hi>bondage</hi> thro' <hi>fear of death</hi> which ſouls are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to before Chriſt <hi>delivers</hi> them; and the <hi>reverence and godly fear,</hi> whereby gracious perſons <hi>ſerve God. Heb.</hi> 2.15 &amp; 12.28. I come to his diſlike of a third diſtinction, which he delivers thus. <q>Hence we may ſee how unfit the common addreſſes at the end of Sermons to believers, as <hi>diſtinguiſhed</hi> from careleſs and unconcerned, are to promote the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of true edification.</q> page 84. Who can refrain from comparing theſe things with what God ſays to falſe prophets? viz. <hi>With lies have ye made the heart of the righteous ſad, whom I have not made ſad; and ſtrengthned the hands of the wicked, that he ſhould not return from his wicked way,</hi> Ezek. 13.22. Yea he ſays, they do it <hi>by their lies, and by their</hi> LIGHTNESS. Jer. 23.14, 32. This may turn us
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010549_0016_0F806BC435FC1568"/>
to look at the line of <hi>practice</hi> which this man is la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to promote; as it is pointed to in various parts of his <hi>Letters;</hi> but is more clearly deſcribed in a pamphlet printed laſt year, called. <q>A plain and full account of the chriſtian <hi>practices</hi> obſerved by the church in St. <hi>Martin's-le-grand, London,</hi> and other churches in fellowſhip with them.</q> In the edition of it at <hi>Boſton,</hi> the churches from him are called "SANDEMANIAN". The profeſſed deſign of it, is <hi>chiefly</hi> to give a <hi>full</hi> account of thoſe <hi>practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> wherein they <hi>differ from others.</hi> page 4. <note n="*" place="bottom">Note, the quotations are from the London edition.</note> And the firſt article of ſuch difference which they name is their having the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Supper every Sabbath,</hi> for which they cite <hi>Act.</hi> 20 7. And becauſe the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples met with that deſign on that day, when <hi>Paul</hi> was there; they would have it, that theſe churches <hi>brake bread</hi> every firſt day, p. 6. Another practice they expreſs thus. <q>In the interval between the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and afternoon ſervice, we have our <hi>love feaſts;</hi> of which every one partakes; by dining at the houſes of ſuch of the brethren who live ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly near,—that the poor may have a comfortable meal at the expence of the more wealthy.—We cannot allow any member to be abſent from the feaſt, either thro' indifference or mere inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</q> page 4.8. To prove this they quote three texts, viz 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.20.21. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2 13 <hi>Jude</hi> 12. Wherein we may obſerve, that <hi>Paul</hi> calls the <hi>Corinth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians</hi> feaſts, their <hi>own ſupper,</hi> in diſtinction from the Lord's Supper; and <hi>Jude</hi> calls them <hi>your feaſts.</hi> Thus three Apoſtles reproved the diſorders which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended thoſe feaſts; and we have no account that one apoſtle ever practiced them. Tis moſt likely that
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010549_0017_0F806BC5283AD7E8"/>
they were taken up in imitation of the old <hi>Jewiſh feaſts,</hi> without any divine warrant at all.</p>
            <p>The next particular of their practice is; at their feaſt, and at the admiſſion of members, and at other opportunities they ſalute <hi>each other</hi> with a <hi>kiſs of charity</hi> page 9 10. And they ſay, <q>we account all objections againſt it, and all attempts to ſet it aſide, by ſubſtituting any other form of ſalutation in its room, to proceed from a diſregard to the authority of the new-teſtament.</q> However I would aſk, is there no difference between <hi>cuſtoms</hi> of expreſſing our reſpects to each other, and <hi>ordinances</hi> of worſhip to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God? And is it as criminal to <hi>alter</hi> the <hi>mode</hi> of expreſſing our love to one another, as to <hi>change</hi> his <hi>ordinances?</hi> The <hi>deiſts</hi> make a handle of what <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of another cuſtom, againſt all <hi>revelation:</hi> one of them once ſaid to me, <hi>Paul</hi> was miſtaken in ſome things, for he ſays, <q>Doth not <hi>nature it ſelf</hi> teach you, that if a man have long hair, it is a ſhame unto him; he miſtook <hi>nature</hi> for <hi>cuſtom.</hi>
               </q> But I think Mr. <hi>Edward</hi>'s remark is a good reply to this; which is <q>that 'tis <hi>cuſtom</hi> which eſtabliſhes any outward ſign, as a token of inward ſentiment; therefore when it had eſtabliſhed the wearing of long hair, as the ſign of a female, <hi>nature it ſelf</hi> taught that it was a ſhame for a man to appear in the known garb of a woman.</q> So here, thoſe precepts which they refer to, undoubtedly require to ſalute the ſaints with <hi>ſincere tokens of love:</hi> But I am not convinced that they require us to ſalute with a kiſs, as a token of <hi>ſpiritual</hi> love, among people who ſcarce ever knew it uſed, to manifeſt any other than <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>carnal</hi> love</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Waſhing of feet,</hi> was a needful kindneſs in old times, to travellers, becauſe their manner or <hi>dreſs</hi>

left their feet expoſed to the duſt; but it ſeems this people are conſcious that <hi>cuſtom</hi> has made ſome alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in theſe things now! for they hold that John 13.14. makes it our duty to <hi>waſh a brothers feet,</hi> only when it can be an <hi>act of kindneſs to do ſo,</hi> p 13. And doubtleſs that <hi>example</hi> of our Lord, ought to make us all ready to do the loweſt act of kindneſs to each other: but to <hi>waſh feet</hi> only as a religious ceremony; this we are told has long been annually practiſed by the <hi>Pope,</hi> and by ſeveral Kings of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This people often profeſs their ſtrict regard to ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet they declare that they find neither expreſs <hi>precept</hi> nor <hi>precedent</hi> therein, for <hi>family prayer,</hi> while they ſay, <q>it ſeems neceſſary for maintaining the fear of God in a family.</q> page 14. But what <hi>fear of God</hi> would they maintain, without precept or precedent from him? <note n="*" place="bottom">I believe there is precept, and precedent too in the word for <hi>family prayer;</hi> but as my views on that ſubject were publiſhed laſt year, I ſhall not repeat them here.</note> However their deſign imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately appears, by their proceeding to judge thoſe who inſiſt upon the practice of <hi>family prayer,</hi> and the <hi>firſt day ſabbath,</hi> but diſregard the <hi>feaſts of charity,</hi> the <hi>holy kiſs,</hi> &amp;c as perſons, <q>influenced to their religious practiſes, not by the fear of God, the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Chriſt, or the ſpirit of truth</q> page 15. Thus they judge others: and as to their own mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, they ſay, <q>In every church tranſaction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whether it be receiving, cenſuring, or expelling members, chooſing officers, or the like; we eſteem <hi>unanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to be abſolutely neceſſary: Nothing is decided by the vote of the majority—In ſome caſes indeed there are diſſenting voices: The reaſons of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent are thereupon propoſed and conſidered; if

they are ſcriptural, the whole church has cauſe to change its opinion; if not, and the perſon perſiſts in his oppoſition to the <hi>word of God,</hi> the church is bound to reject him.</q> page 24.25. What mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous things are here!</p>
            <p n="1">1 Here is a <hi>ſelf contradiction;</hi> for the firſt part of the paragraph aſſers that <hi>nothing</hi> is decided by the <hi>vote of a majority,</hi> while the laſt part declares that the <hi>church rejects</hi> a perſon that <hi>diſſents;</hi> i. e. the <hi>major</hi> rejects the <hi>minor.</hi>
            </p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>OME have thought that there was a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in ſentiment between <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>James,</hi> becauſe one inſiſts ſo much upon juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification by faith without works; and the other aſſerts that by works a man is juſtified, and not by faith only. But if the ſcope and occaſion of their writings be duly attended to, this ſeeming con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction will vaniſh. <hi>Paul</hi> laboured chiefly upon laying the foundation of chriſtianity, where Chriſt had not been named; and ſcarce any thing is more natural than for ſouls when awakned to think, that as by breaking the law they expoſed themſelves to divine wrath; ſo that the way to appeaſe that wrath, and obtain God's favour is to keep the law: therefore he engageth with all his might againſt all ſuch notions, and fully proves that nothing but Chriſt's righteouſneſs can juſtify us before God: while <hi>James</hi> wrote principally to profeſſors, to ſtir them up, and exhort them to live agreable to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,

in the ſeveral places where they were <hi>ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abroad;</hi> and to expoſe the abſurdity of pretending to have faith when it did not produce obedience. He puts the queſtion, <hi>What doth it profit my brethren, tho' a man ſay he hath faith, and have not works? can faith ſave him?</hi> That is, can that be ſaving faith which does not bring forth good fruit; and what profit is there in a man's ſaying he has it, when we have only his bare word to prove it? And he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to make this demand, —<hi>Shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will ſhew thee my faith by my works:</hi> From whence it appears that the juſtification which he is there upon, is what is <hi>evidential,</hi> a <hi>ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and evidencing to others that we have juſtifying faith And to illuſtrate the matter he brings in the example of the father of the faithful, ſaying, <q>was not <hi>Abrabam</hi> our father juſtified by works, when he had offered <hi>Iſaac</hi> his ſon upon the altar? <hi>Abraham</hi> belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God and it was accounted to him for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</q> long before that time; but now the evidence thereof, and of his true regard to God's authority, ſhined forth with peculiar luſture, which I take to be the import of theſe expreſſions, <hi>Now I know that thou feareſt God. Gen.</hi> 22.12. With great propriety therefore, is this example introduced to detect a <hi>dead faith,</hi> and to ſhew the difference between that and a <hi>living one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The apoſtle would have us obſerve it well: <hi>Seeſt thou how faith wrought with his works?</hi> how power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully it governed his heart and conduct, in ſuch a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affair. Yet let us remember, he does not ſay, "ſee how his works produced his faith": No, he ſets faith as the leading grace, and tells us in the next verſe, that <hi>the ſcripture was fulfilled which ſaith, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteouſneſs.

things by the word of his power; his creating man in his own image, and giving to him a law as the rule, and condition of his life; man's breaking that law, whereby death and miſery are brought upon the world! the doctrine of the trinity; the ſon of God's undertaking for us, and his taking upon him our nature, wherein he obeyed and ſuffered in our ſtead, the juſt for the unjuſt, that he might bring us to God; the holy Ghoſt's coming to apply theſe great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings; the reſurrection, general judgment, and the future ſtate of happineſs to the righteous, and miſery to the wicked. Theſe and all other matters of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation, faith is the <hi>evidence</hi> of.</p>
            <p>Evidence is to diſcover what is otherwiſe unknown, and to decide controverſies. Now the <hi>world by wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom knew not God;</hi> and they are full of controverſies about divine things. But faith takes the divine evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence as that which is ſufficient to end all diſputes. The believer ſettles the matter there, if God has ſaid it, that is enough; <hi>for if we receive the witneſs of men, the witneſs of God is greater.</hi> Human teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny about diſtant things, tho' it ſhould come from perſons of good credit, yet the things are diſtant and inviſible to us, and we know men may be miſtaken: but the Lord preſents the great things which concern our peace in <hi>preſent</hi> view, to the believing ſoul. His word is compared to <hi>glaſs,</hi> which opens as it were a window into the eternal world, ſo that when the ſpirit takes the <hi>veil from our hearts, we all with open face, beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the ſame image,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 16—18.</p>
            <p>Theſe plain ſcriptures may teach us the evil of that opinion 'that in the firſt act of faith we believe, that which was not true before'. The objects were the ſame before, tho' we did not ſee them 'till then. And

                  <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.</note> 
               <hi>Abraham</hi> knew it to be God's call, and that was enough for him; he never ſtands to confer with fleſh and blood, nor to ſay, <q>I am in a juſtified ſtate, and therefore I ſhall be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved if I do not comply with ſo ſurprizing and trying ;a command.</q> No, tho' there never was a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand which nature might form more plauſible pleas againſt than this; yet he makes no delay, but riſeth early in the morning, prepares for the journey and goes three days travel to the appointed place, for the heart rending work; and there, with unſhaken reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution he proceeds in his obedience, until a voice from heaven gave him a releaſe from ſacrificing his ſon, and ſaid, <hi>Now I know that thou feareſt God, ſeeing thou haſt not witheld thy ſon, thine only ſon from me,</hi> Gen. 22. 1—12.</p>
            <p>Come precious ſouls, attend here and learn what that <hi>fear of God is,</hi> which is ſo often enjoined and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended in ſcripture: it is not that <hi>dread</hi> that moves many to work like <hi>ſlaves</hi> for fear of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but it is a <hi>noble regard</hi> to God which flows from acquaintance with him, and faith in him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by by the ſaint views him as worthy to be obeyed with all our powers, and that nothing is too dear to be given up at his command. Such is the nature and influence
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:010549_0033_0F806BD640C280F8"/>
of true faith. There are three things in faith which powerfully excite to obedience, and guard againſt all the ſnares of ſin: The believing ſoul views the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> to be true and excellent, therefore to be obeyed; the <hi>promiſe</hi> to be ſure and ſufficient, therefore he ſhall be <hi>ſupported;</hi> and faith preſents eternal thing as <hi>near</hi> and <hi>real,</hi> therefore to be <hi>regarded</hi> without delay. And if we carefully obſerve, we ſhall find that in theſe are the main ſprings of obedience, and that the contrary, is the root of all miſchief.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ſoul by faith views and eſteems all God's precepts concerning all things to be <hi>ſure, right,</hi> and <hi>excellent,</hi> therefore ever to be <hi>obeyed. Pſal.</hi> 93 5. and 119.128. The contrary of this was the main ſnare that drew our firſt parents into diſobedience. God had given them a law, and declared that in the day they broke it, they ſhould <hi>ſurely die:</hi> but the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent repreſented that command unreaſonable, and ſaid, <hi>ye ſhall not ſurely die</hi> if ye brake it; and to him they hearkned, and rebelled againſt God. And tho' ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of their children deny, their being ſinners by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; yet they might be juſtly challenged to produce one of them all, who does not naturally conceit, that the plain letter of God's law is hard and ſevere, and that if they break it, yet the full penalty will not take place upon them. Nay what leſs than this, is impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all their objections againſt the doctrines of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and certain ſalvation in Jeſus alone? Repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as tho' theſe doctrines would hinder obedience. All ſuch objections carry ſuch language as this in them, namely, that men do not view the divine law to be true and excellent, nor the lawgiver to be worthy of all honor and regard; no, but ſince he has got the power in his hands, we muſt make the beſt terms with him we can, leſt he fall upon us and deſtroy us;
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:010549_0034_0F806BD6F6FBE5B0"/>
tho' if we were once certain that we were ſecure there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, we would take our caſe, and live as we liſt. O aſtoniſhing! Is this the dignity of human nature. that we hear ſo much of! We all know that what, we love, and have a great eſteem of, we purſue after and delight in, without being drove to it by terrors, or puniſhments: yea, we will purſue after it tho' ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors and dangers ſhould appear againſt us, and ſtill hope to eſcape the danger, and to enjoy the object of our deſires: Thus the covetous perſon purſues after, his beloved gains, the ambitious man after his honors, and the luxurious man after his pleaſure; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the curſes of the law are levelled direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt him; he ſecretly hopes to eſcape the laſh of them, which hope is ſupported by unbelief. So <hi>Moſes</hi> deſcribes the <hi>root that beareth gall and worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> as being one who heareth the words of the curſe, yet bleſſeth himſelf in his heart ſaying, <hi>I ſhall have peace, tho' I walk in the imagination of mine heart.</hi> Deut. 29.19.</p>
            <p>Every ſoul which runs on in ſin, is ſome way or other blinded about the truth and verity of God's law; but the believer views his teſtimonies to be <hi>very ſure,</hi> and that <hi>holineſs becomes his houſe for ever,</hi> which engageth him to walk in all the commandments, and ordinances of the Lord blameleſs; and he is abundantly ſtrengthned therein.</p>
            <p n="2">2 By viewing the <hi>promiſe</hi> to be <hi>ſure</hi> and <hi>ſufficient,</hi> and therefore he ſhall be ſupported in all the work that God calls him to. This is one peculiar glory of the goſpel plan, that a full ſupply of help is provided and promiſed to enable the ſaint to go thro' every du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the precept enjoins upon him. Is he called to go thro' rough ways, then his <hi>ſhoes ſhall be iron and braſs,</hi> and as his <hi>day is</hi> his <hi>ſtrength ſhall be.</hi> Is
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:010549_0035_0F806BD7E7421068"/>
he aſſaulted with temptation? The Lord ſays, <hi>my grace is ſufficient for thee;</hi> yea, he ſays to all his children, <hi>I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee: ſo that they boldly ſay, the Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man ſhall do unto me.</hi> Heb 13.5, 6. A believing view of theſe and other <hi>exceeding great and precious promiſes,</hi> gives the ſaint a participation of ſuch divine ſupplies as enables him to be <hi>ſtedfaſt and unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as he knows that his labour is not in vain in the Lord.</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. 1 Cor. 15.58. While thouſands and ten thouſands, who have had ſome ſight of the danger of a ſinful courſe, ſo as to bring them to reſolve to lead a new life; yet have fainted in the way, and by reaſon of difficulties without, and ſtruggles within, have given up the cauſe and turned again to their old ways, if not into worſe conduct than before. Alaſs! what multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of old, <hi>deſpiſed the pleaſant land,</hi> which God had promiſed to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> becauſe <hi>they believed not his word:</hi>

And we have abundant evidence that the record of their fall, ſtands as a loud and conſtant warning to us all, to give the more <hi>earneſt heed</hi> to the things which we have heard in the goſpel, leaſt <hi>any man fall after the ſame example of unbelief</hi>

            <p n="2">2. By exerciſe it <hi>grows;</hi> it is compared to a grain of muſtard ſeed which grows to a great tree: So the juſt who live by faith, walk in the path which <hi>is as the ſhining light, that ſhineth more and more unto the perfect day,</hi> Prov. 4.18.

            <p>Yet (amazing to think of!) the ſcripture is not fuller of proofs for theſe doctrines, than the world is of oppoſition againſt them; but if we examine care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, we ſhall find, that what is ſaid againſt the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines of grace, proceeds chiefly from the ſame quarter,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:010549_0041_0F806BDEB664CA18"/>
that the falſe prophets <hi>dreams</hi> did of old, namely, the <hi>deceit of their own hearts.</hi> We may often hear men, telling how they would gratify their luſts, if they believed them doctrines were true; and alſo that if their good works, did nothing towards intitling them to divine favour, they would never do any more. Such language, has often reminded me of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s remarks, that <hi>when he that is a fool wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth by the way, his wiſdom faileth him, and he ſaith to every one that he is a fool;</hi> for what greater folly can a man expreſs, than this? Such language holds forth plainly, that all their delight is in ſin, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if they were once delivered from fear of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, they would indulge their luſts without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul, with all their might: and that as to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended good works, <hi>ſelf</hi> is the ſpring and end of them all; ſo that if <hi>ſelf</hi> was but ſecure they would not care what became of God's honor, or others welfare; and on the other hand, if <hi>ſelf</hi> might not lay in ſome claim for the ſervices they do for God, they would quit the tedious buſineſs.</p>
            <p>This folly is dreſt up in our day, with all the fine language, that many of the wiſe men of this world are maſters of; who, with great pretences of <hi>reaſon,</hi>
               <q>make as bold with the bible, (as to the goſpel part thereof) as one of the ſenate houſes ſometimes do, with a bill ſent them from the other, i. e. ſpy faults, and make amendments, only to clog the ſame, and render it obſcure and intricate, that ſo it may ſink at laſt<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. S.

               </q> But before men venture ſo far to <hi>ſpeak evil of thoſe things, which they know not,</hi> they had better come down to things that they do know: and if they would give ſuch a deſcription of their ſentiments, about what is good oeconomy in their own families,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:010549_0042_0F806BDF3480F2D0"/>
as they do about Chriſt's family, there would be no great danger of their <hi>ſubverting whole houſes,</hi> as they often do. Let one of theſe doctors come out, and tell the world, that <q>He has got a very affectionate and faithful wife, and the way ſhe is kept ſo, is by a conſtant fear of being divorced and puniſhed, if ſhe ſhould embrace a falſe lover; and that he has no other way to keep her in good order, but only by holding her in <hi>ſuſpence</hi> about his unſhaken love to her:</q> Or that <q>he has got an excellent and obedient ſon, and the way he is kept ſo, is by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently threatning to diſinherit him, if he does not behave well; and that he is forced to hold his ſon always in <hi>doubt,</hi> about ever enjoying his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's eſtate; in order to keep him in good ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to his commands.</q> Now when they can convince us, that this is the beſt ſort of oeconomy in a human family, then poſſibly we may believe, that aſſurance has a hurtful tendency; and that it is not beſt, for Chriſt to grant the requeſt of his ſpouſe, when ſhe cries, <hi>Set me as a ſeal upon thine heart:— for love is ſtrong as death, jealouſy is as cruel as the grave.</hi>

               <hi>Paul</hi> was once <hi>hid</hi> under as good a covering as any of theſe; yet when divine light ſhined into his heart, he coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all his doings and poſſeſſions <hi>but loſs,</hi> and <hi>dung, for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> that he might <hi>be found in him, not having</hi> his <hi>own righteouſneſs, but the righteouſneſs of God by faith.</hi> And he warns Chriſt's flock to <hi>beware</hi> of thoſe who taught in the contrary way, as being <hi>dogs</hi> and <hi>evil workers.</hi> Yet this was ſo far from making him care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs about his behaviour, that he directly renounceth the notion of reſting in what he had <hi>already obtained,</hi> and aſſerts that he was <hi>reaching</hi> and <hi>preſſing</hi> after <hi>perfect</hi> holineſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3 2 8.—16.

            <p>But this is doing axactly as the devil would have them, even not to <hi>believe</hi> nor regard, <hi>thoſe things which are revealed</hi> that <hi>belong to us;</hi> but to <hi>preſume</hi> upon the <hi>ſecret things</hi> that <hi>belong to God.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. 29.29.</note> Thus he would have had our Savior preſume upon the <hi>ſecret</hi> ſupport of <hi>angels,</hi> by <hi>caſting himſelf down</hi> from the <hi>pinnacle</hi> of the <hi>temple,</hi> without any regard to the <hi>ways</hi> that divine <hi>revelation</hi> has directed us to walk in. <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. 4.6.7.</note> Chriſt's anſwer proves, that to uſe the ſcripture ſo, is to tempt God, and not to <hi>truſt in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Election is as expreſly taught as any doctrine in the bible; yet it has been dreſt in ſuch a form, in our times, that many ſtart at the mention of it, as ſoon as they would at one covered with a bear-ſkin, and ſo determine againſt the doctrine by their imagination and paſſions, inſtead of being governed by ſcripture and reaſon. Indeed attempts are made to bring both theſe againſt it. One thing advanced for this end is, that to hold that a particular number are elected, would make God a <hi>reſpecter of perſons,</hi> contrary to his word. But if the matter be examined, we ſhall find that the <hi>reſpect of perſons,</hi> ſo often condemned, is a <hi>perverting judgment,</hi> thro' a wrong bias, ſo as to ſhew that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to ſome, and diſregard to others, which is unjuſt. <note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. 10.17.2 Chron. 19 7.</note> Now every pious ſoul deteſts any ſuch thought con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God; yet we have early notice of his reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons in another ſenſe. He had <hi>reſpect</hi> unto <hi>Abel,</hi> and to his offering; but unto <hi>Cain</hi> and to his offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he had not reſpect; which made <hi>Cain very wroth:</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:010549_0052_0F806BE9C1491DE8"/>
whereupon Jehovah demands the reaſon of it, and ſays, <hi>If thou doſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doſt not well, ſin lieth at the door.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">How ſtrange is it, that ſome will bring this demand, as a proof that we are to be accepted for our <hi>well doing</hi> which was made to convict <hi>Cain</hi> of the falſhood of ſuch notions! It was <hi>by faith that</hi> Abel <hi>offered unto God a more excellent ſacrifice than</hi> Cain, <hi>by which he obtained witneſs, that he was righteous.</hi> Both Abel's perſon, and his offering were <hi>accepted in the beloved</hi> Redeemer, ſo that his works were done from a right principle, to a right end; both of which were wanting in <hi>Cain's</hi> offering; therefore his works were not well done, and the <hi>Sin</hi> lay at his <hi>own door.</hi> Every good act flows from love, <hi>out of a pure heart and good conſcience,</hi> and from <hi>faith unfeigned:</hi> and the divine oracles aſſure us, that all who <hi>ſwerve</hi> from this, <hi>underſtand neither what they ſay, nor whereof they affirm.</hi> Heb. 11.4 Eph. 1.6. 1 Tim. 1.5 7.</note> As if he had ſaid, <q>Do you think I am ſo unjuſt as not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept all that is done well.</q> This demand <hi>Cain</hi> could not anſwer; but turns to talk with his brother and to end the controverſy ſhed his brother's blood: and we are expreſly told, that the reaſon why he ſlew him was, <hi>Becauſe his own works were evil, and his brothers righteous.</hi> Gen 4.4,—8. 1 Joh. 3.12.</p>
            <p>Here is ſovereign electing love diſplay'd, in the firſt family of the human race; two brothers come to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, and he reſpects the perſon and offering of the younger, while the elder is not reſpected. This began a bloody controverſy which is not ended to this day; and it all centers againſt God's doing what he <hi>will</hi> with his <hi>own</hi> grace; <note n="‖" place="bottom">Mat. 20.15.</note> and his not being under any obligation to beſtow it upon any, for all their doings. The ſtate of this controverſy is ſet in a very clear light by the evangeliſt <hi>Luke,</hi> who informs us, that Jeſus, after doing wonders in other places, came to
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:010549_0053_0F806BEACB2CD700"/>
               <hi>Nazareth,</hi> where he had been brought up, and on the ſabbath-day, he in their ſynagogue read in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of <hi>Eſaias,</hi> where it was written, <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord is upon me, becauſe he hath anointed me to preach the goſpel to the poor,</hi> &amp;c. After which he began to ſay unto them, <hi>This day is the ſcripture fulfilled in your ears: and all bare him witneſs, and wondered, at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth.</hi> But Jeſus ſoon diſcovered what noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they had of <hi>grace,</hi> for he ſaid, <hi>ye will ſurely ſay unto me this proverb, phyſician heal thy ſelf: what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever we have heard in Capernaum, do alſo in thy country.</hi> Which ſhews that they ſuppoſed this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous phyſician was under ſome obligation to them, ſo that if he did not do as great things there, as in other places he would be <hi>partial</hi> and need healing himſelf: But Jeſus aſſures them that there were <hi>many widows</hi> in <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the days of <hi>Elias;</hi> and <hi>many leapers</hi> in the days of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> and yet <hi>none</hi> of them had ſuch favours granted, as were ſhewn to a <hi>widow</hi> among <hi>Sidonans,</hi> and a <hi>leaper</hi> among the Syrians: Which was as much as to ſay, <q>I am under no obligation to beſtow my grace upon you, becauſe of your out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward friendſhip, but have good right to grant it to <hi>heathens,</hi> while you are left to periſh in your ſins.</q> And obſerve the effect; thoſe who had juſt before wondered at his <hi>gracious words,</hi> now were <hi>filled with wrath, and roſe up and</hi> THRUST <hi>him out,</hi> Luk. 4.15—29. And why ſhould his ſervants expect better treatment than their maſter had?</p>
            <p>As long as any perſon thinks he has any thing in him, or done by him, which can give him the leaſt claim to ſalvation more than others, he will not give in to this doctrine; but a I that are brought to ſee their undone eſtate, as it is, have no other gleam of hope,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:010549_0054_0F806BEB5A513690"/>
than by ſovereign grace: For they ſee, that if any good thing were to be done by them, as a neceſſary <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of their deliverance, it would be a gone caſe with them for ever. But to hear that God is <hi>gracious to whom he will be gracious,</hi> and that he <hi>juſtifies the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly;</hi> this is good news to their poor ſouls: and when they receive it, they can heartily join with <hi>Paul</hi> in bleſſing the father, for all the ſpiritual bleſſings which are laid up in Chriſt. <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him, before the foundation of the world, that we ſhould be holy. Eph.</hi> 1.3—7.</p>
            <p>Obſerve <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>he hath choſen</hi> us, that we <hi>ſhould be holy:</hi> But the modern notions are, that he chuſeth us becauſe we <hi>are holy,</hi> making that to be the <hi>cauſe,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> viewed to be the <hi>effect.</hi> All the controverſy turns upon this point, whether the <hi>good pleaſure of God's will,</hi> or our <hi>free will</hi> be the <hi>cauſe</hi> of our <hi>holineſs and happineſs.</hi>

               <hi>dreams,</hi> while they remain aſleep on their beds.</p>
            <p>However, ſince you are for appealing to <hi>facts,</hi> we will try a few of them. None that believe the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures can reaſonably deny that the <hi>Jews</hi> had high no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their power to do good works: <hi>Paul</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth expreſſy, that they <hi>followed after the law of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> and had a <hi>zeal for God;</hi> and he is as expreſs concerning the reaſon why they did not attain to it, <hi>becauſe they ſought it not by faith,</hi> Rom. 9.31, 32.102 They had no ſuch faith as he taught in ſovereign de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, and ſovereign mercy to helpleſs ſinners. No, they held to works which they could do, to entitle them to divine bleſſings. Now let us ſee what fruits theſe principles produced; they <hi>both killed the Lord Jeſus, and their own prophets, and perſecuted the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles: they pleaſed not God and were contrary to all men,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Theſ. 2.15.16. But the apoſtles on the other hand, preached that both <hi>Jew</hi> and Gentile were all under ſin, and that by grace we are ſaved thro' faith, and that not of ourſelves, it is the gift of God. And theſe doctrines ſpread their victorious and happy influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence as far as the <hi>Roman</hi> conqueſts had ever extended.</p>
            <p>Afterwards there came on a terrible <hi>falling away,</hi> and the <hi>man of ſin</hi> was revealed, who oppoſed theſe doctrines, and carried his notions of man's power to do good works ſo far as to hold, that he could do more than were required. But inſtead of theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples producing <hi>good works;</hi> their <hi>bad works</hi> got to ſuch a length, that the Pope's <hi>indulgencies</hi> to commit ſin with hopes of another pardon, were openly ſold by their miniſters, to get money. This ſhocked <hi>Luther;</hi> and he and <hi>Calvin,</hi> and others were moved to <hi>proteſt</hi> againſt thoſe abominations, and boldly to preach thoſe doctrines, which have born <hi>Calvins</hi> name ever ſince. And none will deny that they produced great and
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:010549_0057_0F806BEFE7161A80"/>
good effects then, but ſuch as are either ſecret or open friends to <hi>popery.</hi> Great was the ſpread, and happy the influence of theſe doctrines in our nation at thoſe times; yet the contrary principles have ſince ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſively prevailed. And a noted divine obſerved eleven years ago, to an aſſembly of the national cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, that <q>'Tis a general complaint, that our chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches are leſs frequented than they uſed formerly to be, and that degeneracy of manners univerſally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails. Now ſays he I may venture to affirm, that the <hi>moral preaching</hi> ſo much in vogue, is the cauſe of all this. In ſhort we have preached morality ſo long, that we have hardly any morality left; and this <hi>moral preaching</hi> has made our people ſo very immoral, that there are no lengths of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which they are afraid of running into.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Jone's</hi> Sermon at the viſitation of the Archdeacon of <hi>Surry,</hi> Sept. 1755 page 16, 17.</note>

ſway'd in his conduct by a regard to <hi>futurity,</hi> is an affront to the delicacy and refinement of his <hi>taſte.</hi> Hence the day ſet apart by the laws of his country, for religious ſervice, he derides and affronts as a <hi>vulgar</hi> and <hi>obſolete</hi> inſtitution.</q> And they have ſo loſt a ſenſe of <hi>honour,</hi> that he ſays, <q>They laugh at the picture of their own follies; they go home, and <hi>without a bluſh repeat them.</hi>
               </q> And he ſhews, that the principle of regard to the publick good is ſo far loſt, and a ſyſtem of political ſelf-intereſt introduced in its room, that <q>a foundation is laid for <hi>endleſs diſſention</hi> in the ſtate.</q> Thus (ſays he) <q>by gradual and unperceived decline, we ſeem glid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down to ruin.

And theſe notions have been the moſt openly eſpouſed in this country of late, that ever they have been ſince chriſtianity was known here; and the effects are too open to need any proof. <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>extravagence</hi> involved people to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that in ſeveral counties they often had more than a thouſand writs at a <hi>court.</hi> And if we review the late commotions about the <hi>ſtamp-act,</hi> what cauſe have we all to be abaſed in the duſt, when we think how many more aſſemblies were gathered, of all ranks, to conſult what creature power or policy could do in the caſe, than there were to <hi>faſt</hi> and <hi>cry</hi> to the <hi>creator</hi> for help? How different is this from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of God's ancient people? <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.3. And tho' truth ſays, <hi>The King's heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whither ſoever he will;</hi> yet the <hi>rejoicings</hi> immediately after the news of our deliverance, which were managed ſo as to deſtroy a number of <hi>lives;</hi> and the <hi>thanks</hi> if not <hi>worſhip</hi> that were addreſſed to ſeveral <hi>inſtruments</hi> of our relief; while there was ſuch a viſible backwarkneſs for <hi>giving thanks</hi> to the great <hi>author</hi> thereof, put me in mind of the note of a worthy expoſitor upon the <hi>Philiſtians</hi> conduct, who aſſembled to <hi>offer a great ſacrifice to Dagon and to rejoice; for they ſaid, our God hath delivered Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon our enemy into our hand.</hi> The note is this <q>Tho' <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s harlot had done it, and they had paid her for it, yet they attribute it to their <hi>God,</hi> ſuch was their blindneſs and ſtupidity; and yet this may ſhame us believers in the true God, who are ſo

backward to aſcribe to him the great things he does for us, when ſuch heathens were ſo forward to give glory to their falſe deities, without any foundation for it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the whole, as the <hi>Jews</hi> earneſtly denied Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus his being a <hi>King;</hi> while their trembling fear of him, and raiſing ſuch force as they did againſt him, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>ſaid</hi> that he <hi>was a King;</hi> ſo now all theſe, and many other <hi>facts,</hi> which are brought againſt theſe doctrines plainly <hi>ſay they are true.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Many <hi>facts</hi> from the remarkable effects of theſe doctrines, in ſundry particular towns and villages in various parts of our land lately, might greatly ſtrengthen our argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but that would ſwell this diſcourſe ſo far that I muſt omit them for the preſent.</note> Many who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe doctrines make great pretences to dignity of ſentiments; and one of their high notions is, that <q>Becauſe the deity can receive no profit from us, therefore his great end in all his works and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations, is his creatures haypineſs.</q> But if 'tis aſked, why then are not all his creatures made hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py? The reply is, "Their own folly prevents it". So that they have got a deity too high to be <hi>ſerved by them;</hi> yet he is ſo low that he muſt <hi>ſerve them</hi> with all his might; and when he has done his beſt, many of his creatures are too hard for him, and fruſtrate his great deſign of making of them all happy! This is turning things <hi>upſide down</hi> with a witneſs! <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.16.</p>
            <p>Another of their high notions is, <q>That they will receive nothing for truth, but what they can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend with their reaſon.</q> Tho' by the way, they expect to be credited in the accounts they give of many of their deep diſcoveries, which at the ſame time they do not ſuppoſe common people can fathom. But forſooth! they are too big to credit what Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah declares, any further than they can comprehend

it! Nothing is more certain than this is, that a <hi>God</hi> which a <hi>creature</hi> can comprehend is an <hi>idol.</hi> The deity which <hi>Paul</hi> worſhiped was quite another kind of Being. Rom. 11, 33.—36. And Heatheniſh prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples will alway lead to heatheniſh practice. Now one of the moſt unnatural barbarities, that I ever heard of in the old <hi>natives</hi> of this country, was, their getting their <hi>powows</hi> when they had a friend taken ſick, to try their magic art to find out whether the ſick would die or not. And if the anſwer was that he <hi>would die:</hi> then no farther pains were uſed, but they let him die as ſoon as he would. Compare this with our modern reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers againſt <hi>certain decrees,</hi> and ſee how much better hearts we have than them old <hi>heathens.</hi> If <hi>they</hi> thought their friends death was determined, that made them neglect the uſe of means for natural life: <hi>theſe</hi> ſay if they believed the event was appointed, they would neglect all means for ſpiritual life. <hi>They</hi> neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected means to keep <hi>off</hi> death; <hi>theſe</hi> uſe means to haſten it <hi>on. They</hi> neglected <hi>others</hi> bodies; theſe neglect their <hi>own</hi> ſouls. Theſe <hi>heathens</hi> might be chargeable with <hi>negative</hi> murder of others bodies; but theſe <hi>chriſtians,</hi> poſitively murder their own ſouls!</p>
            <p>The ſon of God knew, and often foretold what ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings he ſhould go thro'; yet, <hi>in the days of his fleſh, he offered up prayers and ſupplications, with ſtrong crying and tears, unto him that was able to ſave from death, and was heard in that he fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: tho' he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things which he ſuffered,</hi> Heb 5.7, 8. And he gave expreſs warning to his diſciples, that they would all be offended becauſe of him:—upon which <hi>Peter</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that tho' all men ſhould be offended he never would.

deny me thrice:</hi> Yet this certain declaration was ſo far from excuſing his neglect of his maſters caution, to <hi>watch and pray;</hi> and his ſloth, raſhneſs and cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, that when <hi>Peter</hi> remembered thoſe words of Jeſus, <hi>he went out and wept bitterly,</hi> Mat. 26.31— 75. In <hi>Paul</hi>'s voyage to <hi>Rome.</hi> after a long tempeſt had lain upon them, he ſtood forth in the midſt of their company and ſaid, <hi>I exort you to be of good chear: for there ſhall be no loſs of</hi> any man's <hi>life among you, but of the Ship.</hi> And ſhewed how this was revealed to him by an angel; and then adds, <hi>I believe God, that it ſhall be even as it was told me.</hi> Yet ſoon up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, as the ſhipmen were about to flee out of the ſhip, by letting down their boat into the ſea, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the centurion, and to the ſoldiers. <hi>Except theſe abide in the Ship, ye cannot be ſaved,</hi> Acts 27 21—31 He believ'd that the means and end were connected together. When <hi>Daniel</hi> underſtood by books, that the years were near or quite expired, which the Lord ſpake of by <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the prophet, that he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh ſeventy years in the deſolations of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> he <hi>ſet his face unto the Lord God to ſeek by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſupplications, with faſtings, and ſackcloth and aſhes,</hi> for the fulfilment of what God had abſolutely promiſed.</p>
            <p>Now all theſe (and many others) thought there was a conſiſtancy between fore ordination of events in our great <hi>Ruler;</hi> and earneſt prayers and endeavours in his <hi>ſubjects,</hi> for the avoiding of all evil, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of all the good we want.

Theſe things may teach us the evil nature, and pernicious tendency of a prevailing cuſtom in our day, encouraging perſons to profeſs religion, and come into the church <hi>without this faith.

and held that the Lord's Supper was a conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ordinance, and that perſons that were not ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in their lives, might come to it, tho' they did not think themſelves converted.

            <p>Tho' we have had a notable experiment of the evil of it in Mr. <hi>Stoddard</hi>'s church; for his grand-ſon and ſucceſſor Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> practiſed thereon 'till he had got a very large church, and then upon his attempting to have ſome of them called to an account for their <hi>lacivious</hi> and <hi>obſcene diſcourſe,</hi> the town was <q>ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly all on a blaze,</q> and little could be done in the affair.

            <p>The principal arguments that are brought to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port theſe notions are taken from <hi>Abraham</hi>'s cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and the national church which ſprang from him; notwithſtanding the <hi>meſſenger</hi> who came to prepare the way of the goſpel diſpenſation, warned ſouls againſt ſuch notions, and ſhew'd that God was able <hi>of ſtones to raiſe up children to Abraham.</hi> And when ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Jews</hi> believed on our Lord, he ſaid to them, <hi>If ye continue in my word, then are ye my diſciples in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed; and ye ſhall know the truth, and the truth ſhall make you free.</hi> This they immediately reſented, and ſaid <hi>we</hi> be Abraham's <hi>ſeed and were never in bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.</hi> But Jeſus aſſured them, that <hi>whoſoever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>committeth ſin, is the ſervant of ſin.</hi> And adds, <hi>If ye were</hi> Abraham's <hi>children, ye would do the work of</hi>

And we may obſerve that when <hi>Peter</hi> declared the faith which was given him by a ſuper-natural revelation, Chriſt anſwered, <hi>Bleſſed</hi> art thou; and immediately ſays, <hi>thou art Peter, and upon this Rock I will build my Church</hi> Mat. 16.16—18. <hi>Peter</hi> ſignifies, a <hi>ſtone;</hi> he was but one ſtone which was to be laid in the building upon this glorious rock; and he ſays to other ſaints, <hi>ye alſo as lively ſtones are built up a ſpiritual houſe,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.5. Our Lord's ſpeaking of <hi>building</hi> his <hi>church,</hi> directly after that noble declaration of faith, evidently points out the <hi>manner</hi> as well as <hi>matter</hi> of this building. As if he had ſaid, <q>The way in which I will <hi>build</hi> my church is by perſons <hi>declaring</hi> thus with their <hi>mouths,</hi> what they believe in their <hi>hearts</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me?<note n="*" place="bottom">Rom. 10.10.</note>
               </q> Hence, on the day of penticoſt,, when many were <hi>pricked in their hearts,</hi> and cried, <hi>What ſhall we do? Peter</hi> pointed out to them the way of relief;
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:010549_0072_0F806C004ABFDC90"/>
and <hi>as many as gladly received his</hi> word <hi>were baptized,</hi> and added to the church, and they continued ſtedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the <hi>apostles doctrine and fellowſhip</hi>—They decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red both their conviction and converſion, and thus the firſt goſpel church was built up, and walk'd in fellowſhip: and the apoſtle <hi>John</hi>'s account of the way wherein chriſtian fellowſhip is begotten and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted perfectly agrees herewith. He ſays, <hi>That which we have ſeen and heard, declare we unto you, that ye may have fellowſhip with us: and truely our fellowſhip is with the father, and with his ſon Jeſus Christ</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3</p>
            <p>When <hi>Peter</hi> was directed by a viſion from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to go to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and went <hi>without gainſaying;</hi> yet when he came there, he aſked and received a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct account of the ſteps of experience which had led <hi>Cornelius</hi> thus far. Then he opened his mouth and preached Chriſt to all preſent; and while he ſpake, the <hi>holy Ghoſt fell on all them which heard the word,</hi> whereupon they were commanded to be baptized. Thus the primitive churches were built up.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, when one who had been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized as a believer, <hi>ſpoke</hi> that out of the abundance of his heart, which diſcovered that his <hi>heart was not right with God, Peter</hi> ſaid, <hi>Thou haſt neither part nor lot in this matter,</hi> Act. 8.20, 21. So the church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> is commended becauſe ſhe could <hi>not bare them which were evil; and had tried them which ſaid they were apoſtles, and were not; and had found them liars,</hi> Rev. 2.2. This diſcipline was neglected in the church of <hi>Corinth;</hi> therefore <hi>Paul</hi> ſays to them, <hi>Know ye not, that a little leaven, leavens the whole lump? what have I to do, to judge them that are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out? do not ye judge them that are within? therefore put away from among your ſelves that wicked perſon,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.6.12, 13. And to the churches of <hi>Galatia,</hi>
               <pb n="75" facs="unknown:010549_0073_0F806C00F4AC38F0"/>
he ſays concerning thoſe who had <hi>perverted the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, a liltle leaven leaveneth the whole lump. I would they were even cut off that trouble you,</hi> Gal. 5.9.12. <hi>John</hi> ſpeaking concerning the doctrine of Chriſt, ſays, <hi>Look to your ſelves:—it there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your houſe,</hi> 2 John 8—10.</p>
            <p>Query, do not <hi>actions</hi> ſpeak louder than <hi>words?</hi> Anſwer, in many caſes they do: yet how do we know what actions mean but by words? for inſtance, <hi>Simon offered</hi> the apoſtle's <hi>money;</hi> now had he done it for their ſupport in the Lord's work, or for them to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to poor ſaints, the <hi>action</hi> would have been good; tho' by what he <hi>ſaid</hi> when he offered the money, he diſcover'd that his <hi>heart</hi> was not right in the ſight of God. This hint may ſhew the harmony there is between thoſe two different deſcriptions of the laſt judgment, namely, by thy <hi>words</hi> thou ſhalt be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and by thy <hi>words</hi> thou ſhalt be condemned: And, then ſhall he reward every man according to his <hi>works,</hi> Mat. 12.37. &amp; 16 27. Indeed, <hi>fruits</hi> comprehend all that men <hi>bring forth out of their hearts,</hi> in their principles, experience, converſation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; and hereby we are to <hi>know them,</hi> and to act towards them according to the cleareſt light we can gain. <note n="*" place="bottom">Some talk'd much of a diſtinction between <hi>private</hi> and <hi>publick charity,</hi> and aſſert that <hi>private charity</hi> will not do to <hi>act upon in publick affairs.</hi> If by private charity they mean an <hi>inward perſwaſion,</hi> which is not governed by <hi>intelligible evidence,</hi> I readily concur with them: though I fear what is often intended by that diſtinction, is that we ſhould receive all who are willing to make a public profeſſion of religion, if nothing is openly objected a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againſt them, whether we have any proper evdience to our conſciences that they experimentally know the truth or no. Great noiſe alſo has been made about <hi>infallible knowledge,</hi> and of aſſuming God's prerogative to <hi>ſearch the heart,</hi> and the like; but this is all beſide the proper queſtion which is, whether we muſt act towards men, according to what they <hi>pretend</hi> to be, or upon the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt <hi>evidence</hi> we can gain of what they <hi>really</hi> are?</note> If theſe divine rules were duly regarded they

would ſoon ſettle the controverſy we have had concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning who has a right to preach, and who not: for according to theſe rules, if <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> or an <hi>angel from heaven</hi> ſhould come to us, and not bring the <hi>doctrines of Chriſt,</hi> but a <hi>perverted goſpel,</hi> we ought to reject them. While all thoſe who have <hi>renounced the hidden things of diſhoneſty, not walking in craftineſs, nor handling the word of God deceitfully, but</hi> who <hi>by mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation of the truth, commend themſelves to every man</hi>'s <hi>conſcience in the ſight of God,</hi> ought to be received 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.2. <note n="†" place="bottom">Here many are ready to cry, alas! what times are we fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into? a party ſpirit encouraged, and one miniſter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning another: how much better were former days than theſe are? But they forget that <hi>Solomon</hi> tells them, that they <hi>enquire not wiſely concerning this.</hi> Eccl. 7.2. there always have been contentions ever ſince <hi>two ſeeds</hi> have been in the world; and he muſt be very ignorant of his bible who does not know that true and falſe mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have ſpoken againſt each other in all ages, tho' with very different tempers; yea, when the teacher of teachers came into the world, what diviſions were there among God's people about him? <hi>Some ſaid he is a good man: others ſay nay; but he deceiveth the people.</hi> And he was ſo far from denying the peoples right to judge of ſuch matters, that he gave them plain inſtructions to direct them therein. He firſt ſhews the neceſſity of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing engaged to <hi>do,</hi> as well as <hi>know</hi> the <hi>Fathers will,</hi> if we would expect to be guided by him; and then lays down a general rule to judge teachers by: viz. <hi>He that ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth of himſelf, ſeeketh his own glory, but he that ſeeketh his glory that ſent him, the ſame is true, and no unrighteouſneſs in him.</hi> And having given them the rule, he ſays, <hi>Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment,</hi> Joh. 7.12.17, 18, 24. Others judged according to the <hi>appearance:</hi> and thoſe who <hi>appeared in Moſes ſeat,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the eſtabliſhed religion, they judged to be right; but <hi>this man</hi> who had <hi>never learned</hi> in their ſchools, or been <hi>approbated</hi> by their <hi>rulers</hi> and ſtanding teachers, and was admired only by people <hi>who knew not the law;</hi> they accounted a <hi>deceiver,</hi> ver. 15, 47—49. Notwithſtanding he <hi>ſpake as never man ſpake,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly <hi>went about doing good.</hi> But he calls us to judge <hi>righteouſly</hi> according to what is <hi>really ſaid</hi> and done, and not according to the <hi>appearance</hi> and ſhow that men make. Thoſe who <hi>ſeek their own glory,</hi> will be more concerned to have the eſteem and approbation of men, than to <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themſelves unto God,</hi> by <hi>rightly dividing the word of truth,</hi> 2 Tim. 2 15. or to <hi>approve themſelves as the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of God, in much patience, in afflictions, in neceſſities, in diſtreſſes,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 6.4—10. as <hi>theſe</hi> miniſters did, which <hi>theſe</hi> claim a <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> from.</note> Theſe rules are <hi>rational</hi> as well as <hi>ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural.</hi> Saints are often called <hi>witneſſes</hi> Iſa. 43.10. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.1. A witneſs is to teſtify what he knows concerning a matter in diſpute; and God's witneſſes are to teſtify what they know of him, and his truth, which the world is ſo full of diſputes about.
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:010549_0075_0F806C04279CC710"/>
Now every rational mind, in order to be ſatisfied in important affairs, wants to hear witneſſes tell, not only that a things <hi>is ſo;</hi> but alſo how they <hi>came to know it to be ſo.</hi> Hence <hi>civil courts</hi> will not take up with <hi>written evidences,</hi> if the perſons can be had, for they ſuppoſe there is danger of being impoſed upon by falſe teſtimony; therefore they would examine evidences critically, in order to come at the truth. Neither will men be content to have this done by one or more in private, and ſo have what they diſcover reported to the court: No, all who are concerned muſt hear what is ſaid; yea, and have liberty to aſk what
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:010549_0076_0F806C04B902E4F8"/>
queſtions they think proper: and the fear of witneſſes, baſhfulneſs, or blundering in their ſtory, will not be admitted as a ſufficient reaſon againſt this way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding; and why? becauſe their honour, intereſt, or life is at ſtake.</p>
            <p>Yet where the divine honor, and the life of ſouls is at ſtake, the contrary method is taken. For many have given out that they had rather receive two hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites (nay ſome ſay ten) than ſhut out one ſaint. <note n="*" place="bottom">i. e. Had rather receive 2 or 10 enemies than hold one friend in ſuſpenſe, 'till they could obtain evidence that he was a friend?</note> And for fear perſons ſhould blunder in their account, <hi>written teſtimonies</hi> have been received, which have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten been <hi>framed</hi> as well as <hi>penned</hi> by other hands; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by ſigns have own'd it as their teſtimony, when God and their own conſciences knew it was not ſo. Thus churches have gone on; till of late many have dropt, having particular accounts of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in any way; and receive members only up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a <hi>general</hi> aſſent to chriſtianity. And ſome have been ſo ſtupid as to try to juſtify ſuch conduct by the <hi>eunuch</hi>'s confeſſion <hi>Acts</hi> 8.37. as if their openly aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to that which they were always taught was true, was parallel to his declaring his hearty belief of that, which Jews and Gentiles all ſaid was falſe. <hi>Philip</hi> likewiſe had been particularly acquainted with his <hi>ſoul exerciſe</hi> about theſe things before, ſo that he had good evidence of the <hi>eunuch</hi>'s converſion before he baptized him.</p>
            <p>The generality of thoſe who are going on in the ways above deſcribed, are very ready often to caution us againſt <hi>judging:</hi>—yet if we will not run with them to the ſame exceſs of abomination, they can ſoon ſpeak evil of us, and <hi>judge our hearts</hi> at a great rate. But the things I have now related are not ſecret ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:010549_0077_0F806C05833CEB20"/>
they are moſt open and notorious facts; and if any would give me a better reaſon for this difference in conduct, than this, I ſhould be glad to hear it; viz. That moſt men are wiſer for time, than for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and have more concern about their own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, than the intereſt of Chriſt's kingdom in the world. And in vain do men wiſh for better times, while divine rule is thus diſregarded; they might as well look for peace while enemies are not guarded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt; or for health while contagion is freely ſpread.</p>
            <p>Therefore, V. Theſe things ſhould rouſe us all, and engage our ſouls to regard without delay the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly method of relief in our deplorable circumſtances, before iniquity prove the ruin of our nation and land.</p>
            <p>But here I am come to the moſt difficult point in the whole chriſtian plan, I mean applying the call and command to impotent creatures. None but God can keep us from ſtraying to the right or left hand here. Multitudes hold it to be unreaſonable for God to require that which the creature cannot do; tho' the abſurdity of ſuch a notion appears!</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe the divine command ever remains <hi>holy juſt and good,</hi> altho' we are <hi>carnal ſold under ſin,</hi> Rom. 7.12, 14. What a ſtrange conceit would it be, to conclude the creditors claims to be unjuſt, becauſe of the bankruptcy of the <hi>debtor!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. All ſin is a voluntary contrariety to the divine will; how reaſonable then is it that we ſhould be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and commanded to that which muſt be our hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty choice, or we never can be ſaved? and that is a <hi>turning from ſin to God,</hi> Ezek. 33.10.11.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nothing but the light and power of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, brought home upon the conſcience, can ever make a ſoul truely to know its miſery, and ſo to prize the remedy which is provided: for without a ſoul
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:010549_0078_0F806C0635CA37C8"/>
knows he is ſick, he will not improve a phyſician; 'till he knows he is a priſoner he will not welcome a proclamation of liberty; and 'till he is convinced of his great and juſt debts, and that he has <hi>nothing to pay,</hi> he will not <hi>love much</hi> when they are all <hi>frankly forgiven,</hi> Luk. 4.18. &amp; 5.31. &amp; 7.42.</p>
            <p n="4">4 God's call conveys light and life to the ſoul, when and where he pleaſeth. When <hi>Ezekiel</hi> viewed the bones that were very dry, he propheſied, as he was commanded, and ſaid, <hi>O ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord:</hi> and how glorious was the effect? The divine call is, <hi>Awake thou that ſleepest, and ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light,</hi> Eph. 5.14. So our apoſtle after mentioning, that every good gift cometh from the father of lights, who of <hi>his own will begets</hi> ſouls with the <hi>word of truth,</hi> ſays <hi>wherefore, let every man be ſwift to bear,</hi> Jam. 1.17 &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here therefore let us obſerve that true teaching e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhews our conſtant obligation to conform to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry divine rule; and at the ſame time, that all our help ſo to do, muſt be freely received from Chriſt Jeſus, by the influence of the holy ſpirit. From thence we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>gift of righteouſneſs,</hi> whereby all our crimes are forgiven; and <hi>abundance of grace,</hi> whereby our natures are charged, and our ſouls are enabled to die unto ſin, and live unto righteouſneſs. But falſe tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching will either <hi>abate</hi> part of the price, in order to accomodate our duty to our ability, or elſe excuſe the creature from his <hi>obligation,</hi> becauſe he is not able to fulfil it.</p>
            <p>This difference appears plain in all ages. When <hi>Joſhua</hi> in a moving manner had preſſed home upon <hi>Iſrael</hi> the importance of chuſing that day whom they would ſerve, and which had ſuch effect, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple anſwered, <hi>we will ſerve the Lord:</hi>—he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:010549_0079_0F806C07C73922E8"/>
adds, <hi>ye cannot ſerve the Lord; for he is an holy God</hi> Joſhua 4 15—19. He would have them know their impotency, and their need of divine help.</p>
            <p>The prophets orders were, <hi>Tell ye; there is no God elſe beſide me, a juſt God and a Savior. Look unto me and be ye ſaved, all ye ends of the earth — Surely ſhall one ſay, in the Lord have I righteouſneſs and ſtrength.</hi> Strength as well as righteouſneſs is <hi>in</hi> him, and not in ourſelves. So our Redeemer when he came, inſiſted much on the ſtrictneſs and authority, of the divine command, and our conſtant obligation to obedience; and at the ſametime, he as fully aſſerted, that <hi>without</hi> him we <hi>can do nothing,</hi> Mat. 5 Joh. 15. While the leaders of moſt note in that day, <hi>abated</hi> the terms in various ſhapes. They would confine the law, only to outward actions; but Jeſus extends it to our inward diſpoſition, and deſigns: they would have an obſervance of ſmall things anſwer, while they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the <hi>weightier matters of the law:</hi> yea, they would fain have their <hi>forms of devotion</hi> ſuffice, while they exerciſed <hi>injuſtice</hi> and <hi>cruelty</hi> towards the <hi>poor.</hi> Yet they could not bear the thoughts of periſhing any more than others: no, they often enquired what <hi>good things they ſhould do</hi> for eternal life? And can the words <hi>goſpel, faith</hi> or <hi>repentance</hi> help theſe in the leaſt who deal with ſouls in this <hi>partial</hi> line; and can their caſe be a whit better than thoſe who of old had been <hi>partial in the law?</hi> Mal. 2.9. Yea, and is not <hi>juſtice, mercy</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> as much neglected now under a profeſſion of chriſtianity, as ever they were among the <hi>Jews? Paul</hi> ſaw theſe things creeping in, and therefore ſays, <hi>Be not deceived: evil communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions corrupt good manners. Awake to righteouſneſs and ſin not; for ſome have not the knowledge of God: I ſpeak this to your ſhame.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.33.34.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="unknown:010549_0080_0F806C0875D00428"/>But here many of our late reaſoners, will tell us that we make men mere machines, who are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of praiſe or blame: for what we <hi>cannot</hi> do, we are not to blame for neglecting; and if we are actuated by divine power in all that is done right, then we are not praiſe-worthy therefor.</p>
            <p>Anſwer 1. God is the author and ſupporter of all nature, who <hi>giveth to all life breath and all things;</hi> and <hi>heathens</hi> as well as <hi>chriſtians,</hi> derive a <hi>natural</hi> power from him to do <hi>natural</hi> actions; and by that power they may do many things which are <hi>materially</hi> good; but in order for any action to be <hi>ſpiritually</hi> good, it muſt be done from a right principle, and to a right end, without which the <hi>end of the commandment</hi> is not anſwered, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5.</p>

That is thou canſt not believe, becauſe thou art juſt ſuch a creature as Jeſus came to ſave! 1 Tim. 1.15. The bottom of the matter is we can believe that Chriſt came to ſave <hi>good</hi> ſinners, but not <hi>bad</hi> ones: ſuch as have nothing elſe but badneſs. Hence the profligate perſon thinks he believes the goſpel, and hopes for mercy at laſt, becauſe in the midſt of all his extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance he conceits he has an <hi>honeſt</hi> heart, &amp; God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards <hi>honeſty,</hi> &amp; hates <hi>hypocrites.</hi> So in every caſe men conceit they have ſome good either of an inward or outward nature, which will when it is well improved move Chriſt to ſave them Yet when the divine ſpirit ſhews them truly what they are, this takes away all that ſort of faith.</p>
            <p>We naturally imagine that God is <hi>altogether</hi> like <hi>ourſelves,</hi> who cannot love thoſe whom we ſee no lovlineſs in: tho' the truth is that his thoughts and ways are as high above ours, as the heavens are above the earth. The contention in our day, concerning a <hi>general,</hi> and a <hi>particular</hi> faith centers here: for they don't contend concerning who is the Savior; but the diſpute is concerning what faith gives an intereſt in him. Multitudes hold that if we believe the goſpel to betrue, and walk according to the rules of it, we may hope for mercy at laſt; tho' they will ſcarce allow any to know they are ſafe till they leave this world; and for this plain reaſon, becauſe their hope depends upon their <hi>doing well</hi> to the end. Others hold ſaving faith to be a perſuaſion that <hi>Chriſt died for me in particular,</hi> and that this perſuaſion muſt be <hi>worked up,</hi> by the ſpirit's aſſiſtance in our hearts.</p>
            <p>Now each party can ſee <hi>ſelf</hi> and man's <hi>doings</hi> in the others faith; therefore they have carried their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to a great length. Yet after all, when any poor ſoul has his eyes opened, and is turned <hi>from dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

            <p>In theſe debates the ideas of a <hi>dead</hi> or <hi>abſent</hi> friend unawares ſlips into our minds, who has left choice le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacies to a ſelect number of perſons, where there is room for lawyers, diſputes and men's judgments in order to determine who are intereſted therein.

            <p>This ſort of <hi>reaſoning</hi> began near the <hi>forbidden tree;</hi> and generally they who moſt <hi>poſitively</hi> deny their concern in what was <hi>acted there,</hi> ſhew moſt <hi>plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> that they <hi>allow of the deed of their father,</hi> by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in to <hi>reaſonings</hi> againſt what God <hi>hath</hi> plainly <hi>ſaid,</hi> as he did. How is the world ranſacked, and the faults of profeſſors on all hands brought up, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny falſe charges added thereto, and all to guard againſt taking and regarding God's truth as he has delivered it? yea rather than yield; the <hi>pit below</hi> is ſearched, and <hi>Judas</hi> is brought up to carry on the argument a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a cloſe adherence to divine rule in our practice in church affairs.

the <hi>houſe of Iſrael,</hi> before their <hi>national church</hi> was diſſolved: and the great commiſſion to <hi>teach</hi> and <hi>bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize all nations,</hi> was given to the <hi>eleven;</hi> there was no <hi>Judas</hi> among them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.5, 6 &amp; 28.16, 19.</p>
            <p>It is therefore our higheſt wiſdom to acknowledge our own guilt and folly, and freely receive the divine teſtimony as 'tis delivered to us, and preſent our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies a living ſacrifice to God, which is our <hi>reaſonable ſervice.</hi> Even <hi>ſelf intereſt,</hi> if rightly view'd would move us hereto. For if we diſregard the <hi>golden rule,</hi> the Lord will; not who ſays <hi>with what meaſure ye mete, it</hi> SHALL <hi>be meaſured to you again.</hi> Had <hi>David</hi> viewed this when he was tempted to defile his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours wife, and then <hi>deceitfully</hi> to ſhed his blood; and had he ſeen that this would be <hi>meaſured</hi> to him <hi>dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble:</hi> that one ſon would defile his daughter, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther murder him; and then that the murderer would <hi>deceitfully</hi> dethrone <hi>David,</hi> and openly defile his wives; with what indignation would he have rejected that <hi>traveller</hi> which came to entice him thereto?</p>
            <p>Yet becauſe this <hi>ſentence is not immediately execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,</hi> ſinners will not quit their evil ways: yea when they ſee the execution of it <hi>begin at the houſe of God,</hi> upon the <hi>righteous,</hi> they <hi>reaſon</hi> directly againſt <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> and conclude that the awful <hi>ſentence</hi> will not reach to <hi>ungodly ſinners</hi> who <hi>obey not the goſpel of God.</hi> They are <hi>willingly ignorant</hi> of the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and deſign of all God's diſpenſations, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17, 18. 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 3 5.

               <pb n="88" facs="unknown:010549_0086_0F806C0E186E93E0"/>I thought to have ſtopt here; but a review of our preſent ſtate conſtrains me to go farther. For as we are loudly called to <hi>awake out of ſleep,</hi> ſo we are called to ſtir up one another, and to <hi>provoke one another to love and good works.</hi> Many are ſtiring up one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to evil, and it might make us all aſhamed to think that ſinners are more active in the way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; than ſaints are in the way to ſalvation. We can ſcarce go into any company without hearing talk of others faults; yet how rare is faithful reproof? and why? we are afraid of giving offence: tho' when the report comes round to the perſons ears, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence is double.</p>
            <p>How little regard is paid to the divine rule, for dealing with a faulty brother in <hi>Mat.</hi> 18? <hi>One</hi> way by which many evade it is, that the <hi>fault is ſecret,</hi> and therefore they will not take theſe ſteps; yet they can whiſper it all round the church or neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. <hi>Another</hi> is that <hi>many know it,</hi> and ſo they would be excuſed from that method; whereas if the caſe be not openly <hi>in the church,</hi> as that was of the inceſtous man at <hi>Corinth,</hi> I know no other way to <hi>bring it in</hi> aright, but by theſe ſteps. and if any caſe be ſo <hi>ſecret</hi> that we may not open it in <hi>that way,</hi> it ought to remain <hi>ſecret:</hi> for the command is, <hi>Debate thy cauſe with thy neighbour himſelf; and diſcover not a ſecret to another; leaſt he that heareth it, put thee to ſhame,</hi> Prov. 25.9, 10.</p>
            <p>Nothing is more common than to hear men's faults aggravated in their abſence, beyond what they are in their preſence: and as Mr. <hi>Morgan</hi> obſerves <q>An evil report, be it true or falſe, ſpreads much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter than a good one; an evident token that moſt men do not <hi>love their neighbour</hi> as they do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeves.</q> But whence comes this averſion, to giving
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:010549_0087_0F806C0E748DA4D0"/>
and receiving reproof? ſurely not from a good cauſe: for, <hi>rebuke a wiſe man, and he will love thee: and open rebuke is better than ſecret love.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>ſcorner that loveth not one that reproveth him,</hi> Prov. 15, 12. Sin is our worſt enemy, and if it has inſnared us under any diſguiſe whatſoever, 'tis a great kindneſs to have the enemy diſcovered and caſt out. And if others are miſtaken in their reproof; yet it can be no inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to have our <hi>deeds tried and made manifeſt, that they are wrought in God.</hi>

            <p>We have lately been upon the borders of a civil war, for LIBERTY: hanging and burning were not too bad for the enemies of LIBERTY!
