            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Public was much diſtreſſed at Major Andre's Death; and by that Diſtreſs, gave the higheſt Teſtimony of his Merit. The Inhabitants, within the Britiſh Lines, were equally affected with the Army; whilſt their joint Indignation manifeſtly ſhewed the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Senſe of the Injuſtice and Inhumanity with which that amiable and gallant Officer was treated by the Rebels. Thoſe who were ſo much intereſted in his Behalf, are probably deſirous of ſeeing his Caſe properly ſtated—this is done in the following Papers.</p>
            <p>The Letters that were written during the Tranſactions which proved ſo fatal to Major Andre, will beſt elucidate his Views and Conduct. Thoſe Letters, accordingly, are here produced, with other Papers ſubſervient to the ſame Purpoſe. The ſeveral Events, as they roſe, are alſo connected in a regular Series, and Facts are fairly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. Juſtice to Major Andre's Memory, required that theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhould be placed in a true Light; eſpecially as the Account of his Caſe and Trial, lately publiſhed by the Rebels (which is very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and partial) evidently tends to tarniſh his Character, as well as to juſtify, or at leaſt to palliate, their barbarous Treatment of him. To relate Truth, is, in this as in many other Caſes, the ſame as to refute Falſehood and Miſrepreſentation.</p>
            <p>The Remarks that are ſubjoined, were naturally ſuggeſted by the ſeveral Facts; they throw Light upon the Subject, and the intelligent Reader will perceive that they and the Concluſions which accompany them, are fairly deducible from the Premiſſes alluded to in each In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>

            <head>CASE of MAJOR ANDRE, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>A CORRESPONDENCE having been carried on, for ſome time, between the Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Chief and Major General Arnold, through Major Andre, on a very intereſting ſubject, an interview was agreed upon to concert and adjuſt ſuch meaſures as might lead to an attainment of the object in view. Major General Arnold earneſtly urged that Major Andre, the Adjutant General, might be the perſon to repreſent his Excellency at the conference, which was acceded to. They were to meet on Monday the 11th of September, at a place called Dobb's Ferry.</p>
            <p>But the interview was unhappily defeated by an accident which could not be foreſeen, and which it was then too late to prevent. The boat that had in it Major General Arnold, was fired upon b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> one of his Majeſty's gun-boats, which happened to be near; and from which the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, with much difficulty, and at great hazard, eſcaped.</p>
            <p>Although this interview was defeated, and the good conſequences that might have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from it, at leaſt delayed, the object was conſidered as of too much importance to be relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſhed on a ſingle diſappointment; and it was therefore purſued in a way that gave much reaſon to hope for a ſucceſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ful iſſue. Accordingly, on Saturday the 16th, Col. Robinſon went on board the Vulture ſloop of war, which proceeded with him up the North River as far as Taller's Point. From thence h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> convoyed a letter to Major General Arnold, covering one to General Putnam, in which he took occaſion to mention,
<q>That having heard General Putnam was at the High-Lands, he had obtained leave of the Commander in Chief to endeavour to gain an interview with him. He added, that if General Putnam ſhould have already returned to Connecticut, he wiſhed to have the letter returned.</q>
This letter was dated on board the Vulture, off Taller's Point, 17th September, 1780</p>
            <p>Major General Arnold, in his letter of the 18th, in anſwer to the foregoing, mentioned Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Putnam's previous departure for Connecticut; and according to Col. Robinſon's deſire, returned the letter to him. He ſaid
<q>he had mentioned the ſubject to General Waſhington, who thought that any application of the kind ought to have been made to the civil authority, as not belonging to the military department </q>
Major General Arnold, however, ſubjoined,
<q>that if any other propoſals ſhould be made, of which he could officially take notio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them ſhould be confined inviolably to General Waſhington and himſelf.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This letter encloſed an ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>of the ſame date to Col. Robinſon, and one to Major Andre. In that to the former Gentleman. Major General Arnold ſays,
<q>I ſhall ſend a perſon to Dobbe's Ferry, or on board the Vulture, on Wedneſday night the 20th inſtant, and furniſh him with a boat and flag of truce. You may depend on his ſecrecy and honour, and that your badneſs, of whatever nature, ſhall be kept a profound ſecret.</q>
He adds,
<q>I have encloſed a letter
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016731_0004_0F9E702399B688E8"/>
for a Gentleman in New-York, from one in the country, on private buſineſs, which I beg the favour of you to forward, and make no doubt he will be permitted to come at the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</q>
It can eaſily be perceived, that this letter, although it was neceſſary then that it ſhould wear the appearance of one from a farmer to a Gentleman in New-York, was in real<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ty a letter from General Arnold, under the aſſumed ſignature of <hi>Guſtavus,</hi> to Major Andre; in which the latter was invited to a conference under the expreſſed condition and protection of a flag of truce. It bears date the 15th of September, and is the duplicate of one ſent on the 16th by the way of Kings Bridge. As this letter, which General Arnold ſo anxiouſly wiſhed might reach Major Andre, will naturally introduce the ſubſequent proceedings that took place through the whole courſe of the affair, it is given to the public for their information.</p>

                  <p>ON the 11th, at noon, agreeable to your requeſt, I attempted to go to Dobbs's Ferry, but was prevented by the armed boats of the enemy, who fired upon us, and continued oppoſite the ferry until ſun-ſet.</p>
                  <p>The foregoing letter was wrote to caution you not to mention your buſineſs to * * * or any other perſon. I have no Confidant: I have made one too many already, which has prevented ſome profitable ſpeculations.</p>
                  <p>I will ſend you a perſon, in whom you can confide, by water to meet you at Dobbs's Ferry, at the landing on the eaſt ſide, on Wedneſday the 20th inſtant, who will conduct you to a place of ſafety, where I will meet you. It will be neceſſary for you to be diſguiſed, and, if the enemy's boats are there, it will favour my plan, as the perſon is not ſuſpected by them. If I do not hear from you before, you may depend on the perſon's being punctual at the place above-mentioned.</p>
                  <p>Meet me if poſſible: You may reſt aſſured, that if there is no danger in paſſing your lines, you will be perfectly ſafe where I propoſe a meeting, of which you ſhall be informed on Wedneſday evening, if you think proper to be at Dobbs's Ferry.—Adi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But as there is a poſſibility of its miſcarrying, I ſend you a copy, and am fully perſuaded, that the method I have pointed out to meet you is the beſt and ſafeſt, provided you can obtain leave to come out.</p>

            <p>In conſequence of which, it was determined that Major Andre ſhould go; and here it will be proper to obſerve, that the meaſures hitherto taken, were within the knowledge of Sir Henry Clinton, and bore the function of his command.—But the nature of that ſervice was ſuch, as might require future meaſures to be taken that could not be immediately directed by a command ſo diſtant from the ſcene of operation; and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> that could be done in that caſe was to guard againſt ſuch contingencies or diſagreeable events as might poſſibly happen in the way to ſo great an object. In this view of the matter, Major Andre was put in poſſeſſion of every neceſſary cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that became the dignity of command, or the milder affection of friendſhip. He was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly directed not to yield to General Arnold's propoſal that recommended a change of dreſs, but to wear his uniform and receive no papers.</p>
            <p>Major Andre then proceeded up the North-river to the Vulture that lay near Taller's Point, and from thence wrote two letters to Sir Henry Clinton, both dated the 21ſt of September.—The following are copies of them.</p>

                  <p>I GOT on board the Vulture at about 7 o'clock laſt night and after conſidering upon the Letter, and the anſwers given by Colonel Robinſon, "that he would remain on board, and hoped I ſhould be up," we thought it moſt natural to expect the <hi>Man I ſent into the Country</hi> here, and therefore did not think of going to the Ferry.</p>
                  <p>No body has appeared. This is the ſecond excurſion I have made without an oftenſible reaſon, and Colonel Robinſon both times of the party: A third would infallibly ſix ſuſpicions. I have therefore thought it beſt to remain here on pretence of ſickneſs, as my incloſed letter will feign, and try further expedients. Yeſterday the pretence of a flag of truce was made to draw people from the Vulture on ſhore. The boat was fired upon in violation of the cuſtoms of war.

            <p>On the 21ſt of September, a flag of truce from General Arnold arrived on board the Vulture. The flag bearer was Mr. Joſhua Smith, who produced two papers, the one authoriſing him to go with a flag of truce and two ſervants, for the purpoſe of forwarding two letters to New-York; and the other permitting a Mr. J. Anderſon, and a boy, to be brought within the Rebel lines. At the ſame time Mr. Smith delivered the following letter to Colonel Robinſon.</p>

            <p>Colonel Robinſon, not being named in the flag, did not attend Major Andre. The caution uſed about going in a manner that might afford any pretence for a diſpute on a ſubject of ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting a nature, is a deciſive proof that the protection of the flag was deemed, as to thoſe who were named, ſacred againſt any future <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Major Andre was landed ſafe in his uniform from the flag-boat at the landing place in Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſtraw, the place where he was taught to expect General Arnold, who was to bring with him a ſpare horſe; from thence they were to repair to Mr. Smith's houſe, diſtant a few miles from the ſhore. He was punctually met by General Arnold, at whoſe preſſing inſtance he exchanged his uniform for another dreſs; this was contrary to the ſtrong aſſurances which he gave Colonel Robinſon and Captain Sutherland, juſt as he was leaving the Vulture; he told thoſe gentlemen
<q>that he could not reſign his rank, or give up his character, without violating the expreſs order of the Commander in Chief, which he was reſolved not to do.</q>
This he ſaid to avoid the offer made him by Captain Sutherland, of a plain coat for the concealment of his perſon.</p>

The particular circumſtances attending that unfortunate event, may be collected from two letters written by Mr. Jameſon; one to General Arnold, the other to Lieutenant Allen, both dated the 25d September, of which the following are copies.</p>

I determined however to refer his caſe to the examination and deciſion of a board of General Officers, who have, on his free and voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and letters, reported,</p>
                  <p>"Firſt, That he came on ſhore from the Vulture Sloop of War, in the night of the 21ſt of September laſt, on an interview with General Arnold, in a private and ſecret manner.</p>
                  <p>"Secondly, That he changed his dreſs within our lines, and under a feigned name, and in a diſguiſed habit, paſſed our works at Stoney and Verplank's Points, the evening of the 22d of September laſt, and was taken the morning of the 23d of September laſt at Tarry Town, in a diſguiſed habit, being then on his way to New-York; and when taken he had in his poſſeſſion ſeveral papers which contained intelligence for the enemy. The Board having maturely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered theſe facts, do alſo report to his Excellency General Waſhington, that Major Andre, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutant-General to the Britiſh army, ought to be conſidered as a ſpy from the enemy; and that, agreeable to the law and uſage of nations, it is their opinion he ought to ſuffer death."</p>
                  <p>From theſe proceedings it is evident Major Andre was employed in the execution of meaſures very foreign to the objects of flags of truce, and ſuch as they were never meant to authoriſe or countenance in the moſt diſtant degree, and this gentleman confeſſed with the greateſt candour, in the courſe of his examination,
<q>that it was impoſſible for him to ſuppoſe he came on ſhore under the ſanction of a flag.</q>

Warm hopes were therefore conceived, that on furniſhing the neceſſary and obvious proofs, the difficulties in the way of Major Andre's ſafety would be removed. Impreſſed with that belief, Sir Henry Clinton aſſembled a Council of General Officers, who were aſſiſted by ſeveral Gentlemen of the Council of the Commiſſion, and ſubmitted to their conſideration General Waſhington's letter.</p>
            <p>This conſultation ended in a reſolution, formed by Sir Henry Clinton, of diſpatching Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General Robertſon, with Mr. Elliot, the Lieutenant Governor, and Mr. Smith, the Chief Juſtice of his Majeſty's province of New-York, to ſome of the Rebel poſts, with ſuch proofs as might clear Major Andre from the imputation of a ſpy; and ſo we all doubts on a queſtion in which humanity appeared to have ſo much concern. The intention and purport of this deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were immediately communicated to General Waſhington by the following letter, which was forwarded by the return of the ſame flag that brought his of the 30th.</p>

                  <p>For this reaſon I ſhall ſend Lieutenant General Robertſon and two other Gentlemen to give you a true ſtate of facts, and to declare to you my ſentiments and reſolution. They will ſet out to-morrow as early as the wind and tide will permit, and wait near Dobbs's Ferry for your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and ſafe conduct to meet your Excellency, or ſuch perſons as you may appoint, to converſe with them on this ſubject.</p>

                  <p>ON coming to anchor here I ſent Murray on ſhore, who ſoon returned with notice that Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Green was ready to meet me, but would not admit a conference with the other gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen.</p>
                  <p>I paid my compliments to his character, and expreſſed the ſatisfaction I had in treating with him on the cauſe of my friend, the two armies and humanity. He ſaid he could not treat with me as an officer; that Mr. Waſhington had permitted him to meet me an a gentleman, but the caſe of an acknowledged ſpy admitted no official diſcuſſion. I ſaid that a knowledge of facts was neceſſary to direct a General's judgment; that in whatever character I was called, I hoped he would repreſent what I ſaid candidly to Mr. Waſhington.</p>
                  <p>I laid before him the facts, and Arnold's aſſertions of Mr. Andre's being under a flag of truce, and diſguiſed by his order. He ſhowed me a low-ſpirited letter of Andre's, ſaying that he had not landed under a flag of truce, and lamenting his being taken in a mean diſguiſe. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> expreſion this in language that admits it to be criminal. I told him that Andre ſtated facts wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> truth, but reaſoned ill upon them; that whether a flag was flying or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, was of no moment. He ſaid he would believe Andre in preferences to Arnold. This argument held long. I told him you had ever ſhown a merciful diſpoſition, and an attention to Mr. Waſhington's requeſts; that in the inſtance of Robinſon, you had given up a man evidently a ſpy, when he ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his wiſh; that I courted an intercourſe and a return of good officer; that Andre had your friendſhip and good wiſhes, and that Mr. Waſhington's humanity to him would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of acts of the ſame kind on our part; that if Green had a friend, or Mr. Waſhington was deſirous of the releaſe of any man, if he would let me carry home Andre. I would engage to ſend ſuch a man out. He ſaid that there was no treating about ſpies. I ſaid no military caſuiſt in Europe would call Andre a ſpy, and would ſuffer death myſelf if Monſieur Rochamhault, or General Kayphanſen, would call him by that name. I added, that I depended upon General Green's candour and humanity to put the facts I had ſtated, and the arguments I had uſed in their faireſt light to Mr. Waſhington; that I would ſtay on board all night, and hoped to carry Mr. Andre, or at leaſt Mr. Waſhington's word for his ſafety, along with me the next morning.</p>
                  <p>Green now with a bluſh, that ſhowed the taſk was impoſed, and did not proceed from his own thought, told me that the army muſt be ſatisfied by ſeeing ſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> executed. But there was one thing that would ſatisfy them—they expected if Andre was ſet free, Arnold ſhould be given up. This I anſwered with a look only, which threw Green into confuſion. I am perſuaded Andre will not be hurt.</p>

                  <p>A NOTE I have from General Green, leaves me in doubt, if his memory has ſerved him to relate to you with exactneſs, the ſubſtance of the converſation that paſſed between him and myſelf on the ſubject of Major Andre.</p>
                  <p>In an affair of ſo much conſequence to my friend, to the two armies, and humanity, I would leave no poſſibility of a miſunderſtanding; and therefore take the liberty to put in writing the ſubſtance of what I ſaid to General Green.</p>
                  <p>I offered to prove by the evidence of Colonel Robinſon, and the officers of the Vulture, that Major Andre went on ſhore at General Arnold's deſire, in a boat ſent for him with a flag of truce; that he not only came aſhore with the knowledge, and under the protection of the General who commanded in the diſtrict, but that he took no one ſtep while on ſtore, but by the direction of General Arnold, as will appear by the incloſed letter from him to your Excellency.</p>
                  <p>Under theſe circumſtances I could not, and hoped you would not, conſider Major Andre as a ſpy, in conſequence of an improper phraſe in his letter to you. The facts he relates correſpond with the evidence I offer; but he admits a concluſion that does not follow. The change of clothes and name was ordered by General Arnold, under whoſe direction he neceſſarily was while within his command.</p>
                  <p>As General Green and I did not agree in opinion, I wiſhed that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſted gentlemen of knowledge in the law of war and nations, might be aſked their opinion on the ſubject, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned General K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ault.</p>
                  <p>I related that a Captain Robinſon had been delivered to General Clinton as a ſpy, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly was ſuch; but it being ſignified to him, that you was deſirous this man ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed, he had ordered him to be exchanged.</p>
                  <p>I wiſhed that an intercourſe of ſuch civilities as the rules of war admit of, might take off many of its horro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. I admitted that Major Andre had a great ſhare of Sir Henry's eſteem, and that he would be infinitely obliged by his liberation; and that if he was permitted to return with me, I would engage to have any perſon you would be pleaſed to name ſet at liberty.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="unknown:016731_0011_0F9E7029134040D0"/>I added, that Sir Henry had never put any perſon to death for a breach of the rules of war, though he has had, and has now, many in his power.</p>
                  <p>Under our preſent circumſtances much good may ariſe from humanity, much ill from the want of it. If that could have any weight, I beg leave to add, that your favourable treatment of Major Andre, would be a favour I ſhould ever be intent to return to any you hold dear.</p>
                  <p>My memory does not retain, with the exactneſs I could wiſh, the words of the letter which General Green ſhewed me from Major Andre to your Excellency. For Sir Henry Clinton's ſatisfaction, I beg you will order a copy of it to be ſent to me at New-York.</p>

                     <hi>THE</hi> polite attention ſhewn by your Excellency and the Gentlemen of your family to Mrs. Arnold, when in diſtreſs, demands my grateful acknowledgments and thanks, which I beg leave to prefer.</p>
                  <p>From your Excellency's letter to Sir Henry Clinton, I find a Board of General Officer: have given it as their opinion, that Major Andre is a ſpy. My good opinion of the candor and juſtice of thoſe Gentlemen leads me to believe that if they had been made fully acquainted with every circumſtance reſpecting Major Andre they would by no means have conſidered him in the light of a ſpy or even of a priſoner. In juſtice to him I think it my duty to declare, that he came from on board the Vulture at my particular requeſt, by a flag ſent on purpoſe for him by Joſhua Smith, Eſq, who had permiſſion to Dobbs's Ferry to carry letters, and for other purpoſes not mentioned and to return. Mr Smith at the ſame time had my poſitive directions to go on board the Vulture, and bring on ſhore Col Robinſon or John Anderſon which was the name I had requeſted Major Andre to aſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſume At the ſame time I deſired Mr. Smith to inform him that he ſhould have my protection and a ſafe paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to return in the ſame boat as ſoon as our buſineſs was compleated As ſeveral accidents intervened to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his being ſent on board, I gave him my paſſport to return by land. Major Andre came on ſhore in his uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form (without diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iſe) which with much reluctance at my particular and preſſing inſtance, he exchanged for another coat. I furniſhed him with a horſe and a ſaddle, and pointed out the route by which he was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn: And as Commanding Officer in the department, I had an undoubted right to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>But if, after this juſt and candid repreſentation of Major Andre's caſe, the Board of General Officers adhere to their former opinion, I ſhall ſuppoſe it dictated by paſſion and reſentment; and if that Gentleman ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the ſeverity of their ſentence I ſhall think myſelf <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>During the interval between the 2d and 4th of October, General Waſhington's anſwer to the laſt application was expected, with great impatience. This delay, or rather inattention to the application, afforded much reaſon to fear for Major Andre's ſafety; and the encreaſing anxiety of the Commander in Chief induced him to prepare another letter, which was to have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Capt.

                  <p>I CONCEIVED I could not better or more fully explain my ſentiments in anſwer to your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency's letter of the 30th of September, reſpecting Major Andre, than by ſending Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General Robertſon to converſe, if poſſible, with you, Sir; at leaſt with ſome confidential officer from you. I cannot think Lieutenant General Robertſon's converſation with General Green has entirely anſwered the purpoſes for which I wiſhed the meeting. General Green's letter of the 2d inſtant to General Robertſon, expreſſes, that he had reported to you, Sir, as far as his memory ſerved, the diſcourſe that had p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I muſt remain, therefore, altogether at a loſs what they may be, until you are ſo good to inform me, which I make no doubt of your Excellency's doing immediately. I will, Sir, in the mean time, very freely declare my ſentiment, upon this occaſion, which poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively are, that under no d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſcription, Major Andre can be conſidered as a ſpy; nor by any uſage of nations at war, or the cuſtom of armies, can he be treated as ſuch. That officer went at Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor General Arnold's requeſt from me to him, at that time in the American ſervice, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Officer at Weſt-Point. A flag of tr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ce was ſent to receive Major Andre, with which he went on ſhore, and met General Arnold To this period he was acting under my immediate orders as a military man. What happened after, was from the entire direction and poſitive orders of General Arnold, commanding at Weſt-Point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And Major Andre travelled in his way to New-York, with paſſports from that American General Officer, who had an undoubted right to grant them. And here it may be neceſſary to obſerve, that Major Andre was ſtopped on the road, and on neutral ground, and made a priſoner two days prior to Major General Arnold's quitting the American ſervice at Weſt-Point. From all which I have a right to aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rt, that Major Andre can merely be conſidered as a meſſenger, and not as a ſpy. He viſited no poſts, made no plans, held no converſation with any perſon, except Major General Arnold; and the papers found upon him were written in that General Officer's own hand-writing, who directed Major Andre to receive and deliver them to me. From theſe circumſtances, I have no doubt but you, Sir, will ſee this matter in the ſame point of view with me, and will be extremely cautious of producing a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent which may render the future progreſs of this unfortunate war liable to a want of that huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which I am willing to believe your Excellency poſſeſſes, and which I have always purſued.

I have waited until this evening with ſome impatience for the copy of the Letter I mention, not doubting but your Excellency will ſend it to me. I have now to requeſt you will, Sir, do ſo, and I ſhall pay to it every due conſideration, and give your Excellency my anſwer upon it immediately.</p>

                  <p>THE account Col. Robinſon has given your Excellency of our tranſactions, during our late excurſion, is ſo full and juſt in all its particulars, that there is very little left for me to add. But as they have been attended with ſuch fatal conſequences to Major Andre, I hope it will not be held improper if I beg leave to ſubmit my own obſervations on the ſubject, at leaſt ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ar as they relate to his leaving the Vulture, and the light I then ſaw them in.</p>
                  <p>Your Excellency has already been informed, that on the night of the 21ſt of September, a Mr. Smith came on board with a flag of truce. The ſubſtance of hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> order was, for himſelf and two ſervants to paſs to Dobbs's Ferry and back again. He likewiſe had a written permiſſion to bring up with him a Mr. John Anderſon and boy, and a letter addreſſed to Col. Robinſon: All theſe pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ers ſigned <hi>B. Arnold.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moſt of theſe circumſtances I had been previouſly taught to expect; and I had alſo been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that Major Andre was the perſon underſtood by Jo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n Anderſon, and that he was to go on ſhore under that name, to hold a conference with General Arnold. Mr. Smith's powers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me of ſufficient authority; and as Major Andre's going under a fictitious name was at the particular requeſt of the officer from whom they were derived, I ſaw no reaſon for ſuppoſing he, from that circumſtance, forfeited his claim to the protection they muſt otherwiſe have afforded him. Clear I am that the matter muſt have appeared in the ſame light to him; for had it not, meaſures might have been concer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ed for taking him off whenever he pleaſed, which he very well knew I, at any time, was enabled to accompliſh. I am likewiſe perſuaded Mr. Smith's ideas perfectly coincided with ours; for when on the point of ſetting off, Col. Robinſon obſerved, that as they had but two men in a large boat, they would find ſome difficulty in getting on ſhare, and propoſed that one of our's ſhould tow them ſome part of the way; to which he objected, as it might, in caſe of falling in with any of their guard-boats, be deemed an infringement of the flag.</p>
                  <p>On my firſt learning from Major Andre, that he did not intend going on ſhore in his own name, it immediately occurred to me, that an alteration of dreſs might be likewiſe neceſſary; and I offered him a plain blue coat of mine for that purpoſe, which he declined accepting, as he ſaid he had the Commander in Chief's direction to go in his uniform, and by no means to give up his character; adding, at the ſame time, that he had not the ſmalleſt apprehenſion on the occaſion, and that he was ready to attend General Arnold's ſummons, when and where he pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>The night the flag was firſt expected, he expreſſed much anxiety for its arrival, and all next day was full of fear leſt any thing ſhould have happened to prevent its coming. The inſtant it arrived on the enſuing night, he ſtarted out of bed, and diſcovered the greateſt impatience to be gone; nor did he in any inſtance betray the leaſt doubt of his ſafety or ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>I own I was equally confident, nor can I now on the moſt mature conſideration, find the leaſt reaſon for altering my opinion. What, therefore, could poſſibly have given riſe to ſo tragical an event, as has unhappily befallen Major Andre, is matter of the utmoſt ſurprize and concern to me.</p>

                  <p>THE Commander in Chief does with infinite regret, inform the army of the death of the Adjutant General, Major Andre.</p>
                  <p>The unfortunate fate of this officer, calls upon the Commander in Chief to declare his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that he ever conſidered Major Andre as a gentleman, as well as in the line of his military profeſſion, of the higheſt integrity and honour, and incapable of any baſe action, or unworthy conduct.</p>

            <p>To this narrative of the tranſactions relating to Major Andre, it may be proper to ſubjoin ſome Remarks on his Caſe, which is ſo ſingular.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Major Andre was put to death, by the rebels, as a ſpy; but it is freely ſubmitted to the candid, unprejudiced Reader, after he has peruſed the preceding Caſe, whether the charge was not groundleſs.</p>
            <p>Spies are perſons who inſinuate themſelves among an enemy, pry into their deſigns, and view their army, camp, or fortifications. The character of ſpies neceſſarily implies, and the nature of their buſineſs requires, that they ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> clandeſtinely, without the knowledge or privity of the enemy, eſpecially of their principal Commanders; and they are generally allured to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake this ſervice by pecuniary rewards. Now every thing of this ſort was foreign to Major Andre's deſign. His ſtation placed him above ſuch ſervice; his buſineſs was of quite a different nature. He had been invited to a conference by Major General Arnold; and to hold that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference was his only object in going aſhore from the Vulture. The place appointed for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview was without the enemy's poſts; Major Andre went aſhore in his uniform, and in a boat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> as a flag of truce by General Arnold, the Commanding Officer of the diſtrict, to carry him; and he went with the intention of immediately returning when the conference was ended. Do any of theſe circumſtances indicate the ſpy? Do they not evidently ſhow that the character did not belong to Major Andre?</p>
            <p>But the rebels aſſert that Major Andre did not go aſhore in a flag of truce. This is repeatedly mentioned or inſinuated in the "Proceedings of a Board of General Officers <note n="*" place="bottom">Lately publiſhed in Philadelphia, ſince <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

To prove the aſſertion, they alledge that the boat in which Major Andre went, <hi>had no white flag flying;</hi> and that Major Andre himſelf acknowledged to the Board of Officers.

The boat indeed might not have had a white flag diſplayed; but the reaſon was, that it came in the night, when a white flag could not be ſeen, and was therefore uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:016731_0016_0F9E702A59CC7E00"/>Mr. Joſhua Smith, who commanded the boat, was authoriſed by General Arnold, to go to the Vulture, and bring a ſhore the perſons ſpecified in his commiſſion. This commiſſion he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced on board the Vulture; it was written by General Arnold, the officer who commanded on ſhore; and it conſtituted his boat a real flag of truce, whether it came by day or by night; whether it had, or had not, a white flag diſplayed. Thus exactly ſtands the caſe, which fully refutes the aſſertions of General Green, and the other rebel officers on this head. Indeed General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, conſcious that this aſſertion could not be maintained, abandons it, and gives the matter a different turn in his letter to the Commander in Chief, dated <hi>Sept.</hi> 30, 1780; although that <hi>turn</hi> makes no more againſt Major Andre, than the aſſertion that the boat was not a flag of truce.</p>
            <p>Beſides theſe, there are other circumſtances which clearly prove that the boat to queſtion was conſidered as a true, proper flag of truce. It is evident that Mr. Smith, was not privy to General Arnold's deſigns, and that he knew nothing of Major Andre' buſineſs. In this caſe, would be have ventured to go to an enemy's ſhip of war, had he not conceived himſelf to be under the ſanction of a flag?

               </gap>tion?</p>
            <p>Major Andre himſelf neither had, not could have any other ſentiments of the matter at the time. He, equally with Mr. Smith, objected to the proffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In all this, did he not evidently act on the principle, and on a firm belief, that he want under the ſanction of a flag, duty authoriſed by General Arnold?</p>
            <p>Suppoſing then that Major Andre's <hi>printed</hi> letter to General Waſhington, is genuine in every part and expreſſion (which however is doubtful); and ſuppoſing he made the above declaration to the Board of Rebel Officers, and in the ſenſe i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> alledged by them (which may alſo be queſtioned) yet this cannot change the nature of things. The boat in which he wont aſhore, was certainly a flag of truce, and no ſubſequent expreſſion or declaration of his could make it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. It only ſhows that Major Andre reaſoned ill from unqueſtionable facts, and admitted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences which did not juſtly follow. This could only proceed from the embaraſſment of his ſituation, and of which his enemies, unge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It would be needleſs to dwell minutely on the other circumſtances which are adduced by the rebels to ſupport their charge againſt Major Andre, viz. <hi>that under a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a correſpondence, not of acting the part of a ſpy —that the change of dreſs, ſo far as it took place, (for it was only partial) was made by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs order of General Arnold, when Major Andre was in a diſtrict where that Gentleman com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded—that in <hi>paſſing the</hi> rebel <hi>works at Stoney and Verplank's Points,</hi> Major Andre did no more than croſs the North River at a common, public ferry, known by the name of <hi>King's Ferry,</hi> where all who travel that way are under a neceſſity of croſſing, and near which thoſe poſts hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to ſtand—and that he croſſed the river there, with General Arnold's paſſports, in the <hi>evening,</hi>
               <pb n="19"
                   facs="unknown:016731_0017_0F9E702B19E447D8"

(when he could not take a view of thoſe poſts) merely to return by that uſual route to New-York, being prevented by an accident from returning to the Vulture, as he firſt intended.</p>
            <p>To refute theſe, and other allegations of the ſort urged by the rebels, no more is neceſſary than to declare the ſimple truth.—Firſt; that all thoſe circumſtances took place, not only with the knowledge, but by the poſitive orders of General Arnold, who commanded in that diſtrict; which wholly exculpates Major Andre from the charge of a ſpy. I would beg leave to aſk—Did not General Arnold command there at the time? While he was poſſeſſed of the command, had he not a right to iſſue his orders? Were not his orders and authority a juſt warrant and protection for Major Andre! And did they not exclude every idea of a ſpy? However the rebels might diſapprove of General Arnold's conduct, could this affect Major Andre? When they are engaged in ſuch a conteſt as the preſent, which threatens this country with utter ruin, and fervitude from France; can they think otherwiſe than that ſome of their Generals—influenced by principles of humanity and freedom, and deſirous of averting that ruin and ſervitude—will abandon ſo infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous a cauſe, and return to their natural and rightful Sovereign, who offers peace, ſecurity, and freedom to this country? And is it right, that on theſe occaſions, the innocent ſhould ſuffer for thoſe whom they may be pleaſed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> guilty?</p>
            <p>In the next place; that Major Andre neither intended, nor employed, any of thoſe alleged circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to ſerve the purpoſes of a ſpy. He did not, in truth, view the rebel army; he did not viſit or enter into any rebel poſt; he did not con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> with any perſon except General Arnold, to confer with whom was the ſole object of his going aſhore; neither did he do any thing elſe to ſerve or act as a ſpy. On the contrary, there is the cleareſt evidence, that his buſineſs and deſigns were wholly different from thoſe of ſpies, and conſequently, that he was no ſpy. General Waſhington and the Board of rebel officers were no ſtrangers to that evidence; let the world then judge of the equity of their deciſion and procedure.</p>
            <p>I ſhall only add further on this head, that Major Andre, when returning to New-York, had General Arnold's paſſports, which that officer had certainly a right to grant. Major Andre was alſo taken on ground that was alternately traverſed by parties from both armies; and was much nearer to the Britiſh poſt at Kingſbridge, than to any rebel poſt.</p>
            <p n="2">II. From the proceding caſe it appears that there was not only much precipitancy in the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Major Andre; but a vein of low duplicity runs through the whole of the rebel proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in this buſineſs.</p>
            <p>The Board of General Officers did not abſolutely pronounce Major Andre to be a ſpy; but "reported—that he ought to be conſidered as a ſpy from the enemy." When Gen. Waſhington wrote to his Excellency the Commander in Chief, and tran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſitted the report of that Board, he gave "no opinion or determination of his own" on the report; of which Sir Henry Clinton takes notice in his letter to General Waſhington, of <hi>October</hi> 4th; and therefore profeſſes himſelf
<q>at a loſs what they may be.</q>
General Green in the conference at Dobbs's Ferry, amuſed Gen. Robertſon with deluſive hopes of Major Andre's ſafety; in ſo much that the latter wrote to the Commander in Chief, immediately after the conference,—
<q>I am perſuaded Andre will not be hurt.</q>
Yet Andre's deſtruction was then reſolved on; and he was executed whilſt General Robertſon lay off Dobbs's Ferry. Of a ſimilar complexion was General Green's declaration at the ſame conference—"That the army muſt be ſatisfied by ſeeing ſpies executed:" When it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the teſtimony of ſeveral rebel officers who were preſent at the execution, and of other ſpectators, that the rebel army in general was much diſguſted and diſtreſſed at putting Major An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dre to death—many of the rebel ſoldiers melted into tears!</p>
            <p>Such duplicity and tergiverſation is very unbecoming men of honour in any caſe—in ſo ſerious a matter, where the life of a moſt worthy, innocent man, and the cauſe of humanity, were deeply concerned, it was highly criminal. The guilt on this occaſion was the more aggravated, as the charge was falſely founded; and thoſe who brought it, muſt have known it to be ſo. Every
<pb n="20"
                   facs="unknown:016731_0018_0F9E702BDA30FC90"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
judicious, unprejudiced perſon muſt be clearly of opinion, that General Waſhington and the Board of rebel officers did not, and could not believe that Major Andre was really a ſpy—unleſs it be urged in their behalf, that through habitual duplicity, and reſigning themſelves to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of preju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ce and reſentment, they loſt, as ſometimes happens, the power of diſtinguiſhing between appearances and reality, between truth and falſhood. If they, or their friends, chuſe to avail themſelve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of this plea, I have no objection; and proceed—</p>
            <p n="3">III. From General Waſhington's letters to the Board of officers, and to his Excellency, the Commander in Chief, it appears that he (Waſhington) had prejudged Major Andre's caſe. In the former, he deſires thoſe officers "to report—the puniſhment that ought to be inflicted." In the latter, he tells the Commander in Chief,
<q>that Major Andre was taken in ſuch circumſtances as would have juſtified the moſt ſummary proceedings againſt him</q>
—that is, would have judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied General Waſhington in hanging Major Andre immediately. If this was the caſe, what need of the trial by a Board of officers? Why was that force acted? The commander of an army is certainly competent to order the execution of as acknowledged ſpy. And had Gen. Waſhington proceeded thus ſummarily, it had been infinitely more pardonable, than the manner in which he has acted. In the former caſe, he would perhaps be charged with raſhneſs and paſſion—the world will find a name for the latter.</p>
            <p>General Waſhington is a very <hi>prudent</hi> man—he does thoſe things with deliberation, which others do in heat. Conſcious that the putting Major Andre to death, circumſtanced as that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was, muſt be attended with much blame; the <hi>prudent, deliberate</hi> General judged it beſt that others ſhould take a ſhare of that blame. In the Board of General Officers, he knew he had willing inſtruments for his purpoſe; and he thought that blame or guilt, when portioned out among many, like a divided ſtream, becomes leſs. Some people in the tranſports of rage, or diſappointment, or on ſome trying emergency, will do what they would ſhudder at in the calm hour of reflection; but commend me as the man, who with affected moderation, ſteady tranquility, and cool deliberation, can do what no rage, however violent, no emergency, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever trying, can juſtify!</p>
            <p>It may be fairly concluded, that General Waſhington was unalterably determined on Major Andre's death, from the beginning. He ſeems to have hurried on the execution, leſt ſomething ſhould have intervened to thwart his purpoſe, and ſave that unfortunate gentleman—the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> was an interval of only <hi>two days</hi> between the trial and excecution. No ſooner was the Commander in Chief appri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed of the unjuſt ſentence deno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d by the Board of Rebel Officers, than he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched three gentlemen of high rank in the military and civil lines, to give a true ſtate of facts; only one of them was permitted to come aſhore, and hold a conference of a few minutes with General Green. All that was then urged—and enough was urged to ſway any one that was not predetermined, and deaf to the evidence of truth—
<q>made no alteration in General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington's opinion and determination.</q>
General Robertſon in that conference, and in his letter to General Waſhington, propoſed—
<q>that diſintereſted Gentlemen of knowledge in the law of war and nations might be aſked their opinion on the ſubject; and he mentioned General Kayp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſon and Monſieur Rochambault;</q>
but this was rejected—the hazard of ſaving Major Andre by ſuch an equitable deciſion, was too great.</p>
            <p>The Commander in Chief, anxious for the ſafety of his Adjutant-General, and not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending that his execution would be puſhed on ſo rapidly, wrote to General Waſhington, <hi>October</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; and in that letter, his Excellency ſtated Major Andre's caſe in the cleareſt manner, and evinced his in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nce by unanſwerable arguments; but the <hi>prudent</hi> General neither wanted nor waited for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mation. Major Andre's ſervant, who had been a mournful ſpectator of his maſter's fate, re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d to New-York, before the letter could be diſpatched; for as the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, it was frequently interrupted by winds and tides.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:016731_0019_0F9E702C99963778"/>In addition to all this, it ſhould be obſerved, that the report of the Board of officers laid no neceſſity on General Waſhington to hurry Major Andre's execution, or to put him to death; he had it fully in his powder to ſave him, notwithſtanding their report; and there is no evidence that the Congreſs interfered in the matter, or gave any order that Major Andre ſhould be put to death. So that General Waſhington ſhould be conſidered as the MURDERER of Major Andre. This, I may venture to ſay, is the opinion of every Loyaliſt in America — it muſt be the opinion of all impartial people, in every part of the world, who know or read Major Andre's Caſe.</p>
            <p>Whatever may be the conſequences of Major Andre's execution, (and many that are bad may follow) one is certain—it has fixed an indelible ſtain on General Waſhington's character— a ſtain which no time can efface. The reflection that he doomed this innocent and worthy Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman to death, merely to ſerve the views of ambition and policy, muſt imbitter all his future enjoyments. His name will be tranſmitted to poſterity with this hateful circumſtance—that he was the unrelenting MURDERER of Major Andre.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. It is inconceivable that perſonal reſentment againſt this Gentleman could inſtigate Gen. Waſhington to act thus. Nothing of this ſort appears; and ſo far as any thing that was perſonal might interfere, the gentle and winning manners of Major Andre would diſarm, rather than provoke reſentment, had he been a priſoner among the moſt ſavage of mankind. Some other cauſe therefore muſt have operated, and produced ſo baſe a conduct.</p>
            <p>Major Andre himſelf has hinted that "he was the victim of policy." But of what policy? Not of any certainly that tended to the honour of the American army, or advantage of the American coloniſts. It was no proof of valour in the former, or that they were engaged in a juſt cauſe; neither was the doing an ill and cruel thing any indication of fortitude in their leaders. True valour and fortitude are always generous and humane; cowardice is the reverſe—it is cruel and unforgiving. The tears ſhed by the rebel ſoldiers on the occaſion, did them honour, and exculpated them from any ſhare in the guilt: and after thus ſympathizing with this brave man, unjuſtly put to death, how can they be attached to the leader who is ſtained with his blood?</p>
            <p>With regard to the Coloniſts at large, this affair muſt prove injurious, by its tendency to raiſe a ſpirit of retaliation in the Britiſh army. Who can tell what numbers of the Coloniſts in rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion may ſuffer death on this account, who might otherwiſe be ſpared? An inceaſed ſoldiery cannot always be reſtrained; to ſay nothing of the retaliation which this ſtep will not only juſtify, but demand.—On the other hand, much good and many benefits both to the rebel army and Coloniſts would have accrued from lenity, or even ſhewing juſtice to Major Andre. It would have given riſe to acts of mutual humanity, have prevented the effuſion of blood, and thereby ſoftened the horrors of this unnatural war.</p>
            <p>If then there was policy in the caſe, as undoubtedly there was, it could only relate to General Waſhington. What the object was which this political ſtroke aimed at, we are now to enquire; and probably the letter of Colonel Hamilton (General Waſhington's aide de camp) to Captain Sears, lately intercepted, may lend a clue that will guide us to the true object. Many a dark ſcheme of policy has been unravelled and brought to light by ſuch accidents. That letter is dated in October, near the time when Major Andre was executed; it was written by General Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's confidential friend, and therefore we cannot doubt of its containing that General's ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and it is written to a man who, from the beginning of this rebellion, is well known to have been a tool, employed by abler heads, to carry on the ſchemes of revolt, and forward mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that were new and difficult in the execution; by bellowing at popular meetings, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring people's minds for the reception of thoſe ſchemes and meaſures.</p>
            <p>From that letter we learn, that the leaders of this rebellion find themſelves ſtill in want of many things which are eſſential to their ſyſtem, and neceſſary to accompliſh their purpoſe; for the Colonel declares "it is impoſſible the conteſt can be much longer ſupported on the preſent
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:016731_0020_0F9E702D5987CFF8"/>
footing." The articles they have not yet, but <hi>muſt have</hi> ſoon, are many; though one ſeems particularly neceſſary; and to prevent any alarm by the propoſal of it, it is very dexterouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed, diverſified, and ſhuffled in among others which are ſeemingly harmleſs. The Colonel aſſerts,
<q>we muſt have a government with more power—we muſt have an adminiſtration dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from Congreſs, and in the hands of ſingle perſons under their orders.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Affairs in America, are now verging to that point which had long ſince been foreſeen; and which the experience of mankind, in ſimilar ſituations, had taught us to expect. Popular li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs has ſcarcely ever failed to end in the deſpotiſm of ONE. This is the natural courſe of things, and is unavoidable. The power that is diſperſed among the people, is feeble, becauſe it is divided. To exert it with effect, it muſt be collected, like the rays of the ſun in a focus, and concentrated in <hi>one.</hi> The circumſtances which caſually riſe in ſuch ſtruggles as the preſent, point out the neceſſity of the meaſure; and this again gradually reconciles ſome people, however averſe from it in the beginning; and impoſes on others the neceſſity of ſubmiſſion, having no other alternative to chuſe. This was the caſe in Rome, in England; and it would be the caſe in America, were the preſent rebellion to ſucceed.</p>
            <p>General Waſhington has ſagacity enough to perceive this, and that matters cannot long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as they now are. The <hi>prudent</hi> General avails himſelf of the confuſions in which he has <hi>kindly</hi> aſſiſted to involve his country. To ſupport the preſent conteſt, ſome one perſon muſt be veſted with ſupreme power; a power that will pervade all the American <hi>States,</hi> and call forth their united force; which, in their preſent democratic, disjointed form, cannot be ſo vigorouſly exerted. Or to uſe Colonel Hamilton's words
<q>they muſt have a government with more power—they muſt have an adminiſtration different from Congreſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But who can with more propriety, or greater probability of ſucceſs, look up for an inveſtiture in that authority, power or adminiſtration, whether under the name of King, Protector, or Dictator, than General Waſhington himſelf? In theſe times however, when ſo many are ſhaken in their attachment to Congreſs, by the preſſure of calamities, that are ſtill increaſing; and by the proſpect of inevitable ruin and ſlavery to America, on the rebel plan; it was neceſſary for General Waſhington to give the Congreſs, and the determined rebels out of Congreſs, on whom he more depends, the fulleſt proof of his firm adherence to their cauſe: It might alſo be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to create a further neceſſity for the office of King or Dictator, by puſhing matters to greater extremities. Now what can be conceived more happily adapted to all theſe purpoſes, than the putting Major Andre, Adjutant-General of the Britiſh army, to death? On this view of the matter, his innocence and rank, inſtead of ſaving him, pleaded ſtrongly againſt him; they were incentives to puniſh, and inſured his deſtruction. For according to the well known maxim of the rebels, the greater ſacrifice a man makes of loyalty, honour, juſtice, gratitude, &amp;c. in their behalf, he is deemed ſo much the more meritorious, and a truer friend to their cauſe.</p>
            <p>If all thoſe circumſtances are duly weighed, compared, and laid together, they will fairly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the treatment that Major Andre met with; and this inference will naturally follow, that he fell a victim to General Waſhington's ambition.</p>
            <p n="5">V. The execution of Major Andre gave general diſguſt even to the rebels. It is a certain fact, that many of them have pronounced it a raſh, ill-judged ſtep; and that the evidence againſt him even according to their own account, did not juſtify ſuch ſeverity. They have alſo expreſſed their apprehenſions of re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aliation, and other bad conſequences, without any viſible benefit, or probable advantage from ſuch unrelenting rigour. And although General Waſhington, took prudent meaſures to impart a ſhare of the blame to others, and ſhift it as much as he could from himſelf; yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>till he was conſidered as the principal actor in the tragedy, and the moſt guilty in this dark buſineſs.</p>
            <p>The <hi>prudent</hi> General and his adherents were conſcious of this, and have uſed ſome expedients to ward off the inconveniences that might ariſe from it. Among other advocates, a truſty friend (ſuppoſed to be Colonel Hamilton) ſtepped forth, and wrote a letter which was artfully calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:016731_0021_0F9E702E2CF8A648"/>
for the purpoſe, and has been circulated by the rebel news-papers, through every part of the continent that owns the ſway of Congreſs <note n="*" place="bottom">See a very long letter, which common ſame gave to this gentleman, and from many circumſtances the preſumption is ſtrong that it was his. It was publiſhed in the rebel news papers ſoon after Major Andre's execution; and gives a detail of his capture, trial, and death; with ſeveral circumſtances attending each, which were not known to us before. In general, facts are ſtated in this letter with tolerable candour, but they are tortured to concluſions which they will not bear. To give ſome plauſibility to his reaſoning, this gentleman obſerves—
<q>The authoriſed maxims and practices of war, are the ſatire of human nature</q>
He ſpeaks from experience, and what he has ſeen; having never ſerved in any war but the preſent, and in no army but that of the rebels; and with reſpect to them the obſervation is true. But the civiliſed nations of Europe, wage war in another manner, and on very different maxims; and I may affirm with General Robertſon,
<q>That no military caſuiſt in Europe, would call Major Andre, a ſpy.</q>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>The letter-writer attempts to juſtify all the proceedings againſt Major Andre; he affects to treat with ridicule the arguments that were offered in his behalf; but we muſt beg his pardon for not being complaiſant enough to be laughed out of the principles of humanity, juſtice and truth. At the ſame time, he ſays many handſome things of Major Andre, and is even laviſh in his praiſe. Another letter-writer, who figures under the ſignature of Z, and is embarked in the ſame deſign with the former, beſtows many encomiums on Major Andre; and tells us— "Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Waſhington admired Major Andre, and ſhed tears at his death."</p>
            <p>Now all this was to do wonders among the credulous populace. Their ſcruples and imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt inſtantly vaniſh; for how could they imagine that General Waſhington, whoſe Aide de Camp, and other friends, ſaid ſuch fine things of Major Andre, could treat that gentleman with cruelty or injuſtice? Or that he could weep, like the Crocodile, over the victim he had deſtroyed?</p>
            <p>The Letter-writer (ſuppoſed to be Colonel Hamilton) aſſerts—
<q>Never perhaps did a man ſuffer death with more juſtice, or deſerve it leſs,</q>
than Major Andre. I cannot deſcend to verbal criticiſm; and ſhall therefore only obſerve, that both parts of this aſſertion cannot be true.— Juſtice awards to every man what he deſerves. If Major Andre ſuffered death with juſtice, he certainly deſerved it; if he did not deſerve it, the injuſtice is evident. This inſtance ſhews how difficult it is even for a man of ſenſe to preſerve a conſiſtency, when vindicating a cauſe which has neither truth nor juſtice to ſupport it.</p>
            <p>But perhaps another aſſertion of his may help to clear up the matter.
<q>Arnold, or he (Andre) muſt have been the victim; the former was out of our power;</q>
               <q>there was no way of ſaving Andre.</q>
By what train of ideas the concluſion is here connected with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſes, this gentleman has not been pleaſed to inform us. For my part, I can ſee no connection or relation between them. Suppoſing that General Arnold was guilty, according to the letter-writer's judgment; was this a good reaſon why Major Andre, whom he deems innocent, ſhould ſuffer, only becauſe the former was out of their power? This gentleman allows that Major Andre did not deſerve death; and in many paſſages of his letter, he grant, in effect and by neceſſary deduction, that he was no ſpy. If he was not, why was he put to death as a ſpy? Why ſuffer what he did not deſerve? This is what I condemn, and what the world will condemn, as a moſt flagrant piece of injuſtice and barbarity.</p>
            <p>But juſtice according to rebel ideas, and as applied by the rebel leaders to the preſent caſe, means no more, it ſeems, than that one or other of thoſe men <hi>muſt</hi> be a victim—<hi>ſic volo, ſic jubeo;</hi> and becauſe the one, who, in their eſtimation, deſerved to be the victim, happened to be out of their reach; the other, who, in their eſtimation, deſerved it not, <hi>muſt</hi> ſuffer, as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of the former!</p>

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>This, I preſume, is one of thoſe
<q>authoriſed maxims of war, which are the ſatire of human nature,</q>
a moſt keen ſatire indeed on all who dare avow and practice ſuch; ambition is their only guide, the ſword their law, arbitrary will their rule of juſtice, ſuperior force their right, and ſelf-intereſt the ſpring of all their actions. Were ſuch maxims univerſally adopted, all honour, juſtice, gratitude and integrity, would ſoon be baniſhed from the earth. In truth, this gentleman undertook a taſk which was above his, or any other man's abilities, viz. To vindicate General Waſhington from the charge of injuſtice and cruelty to Major Andre; and yet do juſtice to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Andre.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. The letters and proceedings which have been brought to public view in Major Andre's Caſe, throw much light on the ſtate of things here. Among other matters deſerving of notice, we perceive how very different the ſpirit and principles are, which actuate the Commander in Chief and the Britiſh officers, from thoſe which influence the Rebel Chief and his aſſociate leaders. How ſtriking a contraſt is the humane procedure on the one ſide, to the outrage and barbarity on the other! The one, pleading for, and aſſerting the rights of humanity and juſtice; the other, inſulting and trampling on thoſe rights! The one, urging that a mutual exchange of kind offices might take place to ſoften the horrors of war; the other, ſpurning thoſe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and perſiſting to do what muſt increaſe theſe horrors! The one demonſtrating the ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their profeſſions by ſparing lives that were forfeited to juſtice; the other, evincing their unfeigned malignity, by putting thoſe to death who were innocent!</p>
            <p>Capt. Robinſon, an acknowledged ſpy, was taken, and delivered to the Commander in Chief: General Waſhington requeſted that he might be conſidered, not as a ſpy, but a priſoner, and be exchanged; which was humanely granted. We ſee the return that was made in the caſe of Major Andre. He was no ſpy; yet contrary in the moſt earneſt importunities, and the dictates of juſtice, he was put to death.</p>
            <p>The bad conduct of a great number of the principal rebel priſoners in Charleſtown lately, who were admitted to a parole, might perhaps have
<q>juſtified the moſt ſummary proceedings againſt them.</q>
But theſe men, even in an hour of danger, were treated with lenity. Their corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with the rebel army, and other circumſtances, which were poſitive branches of parole, and a violation of the laws of hoſpitality, as well as of thoſe of war, drew from the King's officers in Charleſtown no other treatment than ſending them firſt on board ſhip, and afterwards to St. Auguſtine.</p>
            <p>At this moment, there are many perſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> our power, who by the laws of war, might have long ſince been juſtly executed.</p>
            <p>If the reader would ſee another inſtance of the humane and generous procedure on the King's ſide, let him look into the Appendix that is annexed. A man who has any ſentiments of delicacy will probably be ſurprized, that immediately after the execution of Major Andre, Gen. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington ſhould apply to the Commander in Chief, and requeſt a favour. Yet this was actually done <hi>four days</hi> only after that tragical event!—If the mind is diſguſted at ſuch a requeſt under thoſe circumſtances; it muſt alſo be filled with admiration at the anſwer that was returned. The neglect ſhewn by General Waſhington to prior applications from the Commander in Chief, and on a ſubject very intereſting to him, would have juſtified the latter in ſhowing an equal neglect on this occaſion. But where the cauſe of humanity was concerned, all difficulties inſtantly vaniſhed.</p>
            <p>An anſwer was immediately returned to General Waſhington's letter; and the aſſurances it contained,—
<q>that Lord Cornwallis would not ſtain the luſtre of the King's arms with acts of cruelty,—that his Lordſhip is incapable of ſtraining the laws to take away the lives and liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the innocent—that if any forced conſtruction be put upon the laws by his Lordſhip, it
<pb n="25"
                      facs="unknown:016731_0023_0F9E702F99BC70A0"

will be in favour of the accuſed—and that every plea their friends can offer for them, will be humanely heard and reſpected </q>
—Theſe aſſurances, I ſay, whilſt they reflected the higheſt honour on the author, muſt have ſtung General Waſhington to the heart, ſince his own conduct had lately been juſt the reverſe of all this; the bluſh of conſcious guilt muſt have reddened his check, whilſt he read them.</p>
            <p>The difference, ſo manifeſt in all thoſe caſes, ſhould not be referred to cauſes that are perſonal only; although they have very great weight, as might be evinced, did not delicacy forbid me to enlarge on them. One cauſe is obvious, and ſhould not be paſſed over. The Commander in Chief acts by the orders, and is the repreſentative, of a moſt amiable Sovereign, who wiſhes to reclaim, and not deſtroy, his deluded ſubjects: His antagoniſt is an uſurper, raiſed by the caprice of fortune to a ſtation which he could not have reaſonably aſpired to —his conduct is ſuch as might be expected from that character; and from one who is in the pay and ſervice of France;<note n="*" place="bottom">General Waſhington is a Lieutenant General and an Admiral in the French ſervice.</note> and by the aſſiſtance of France, aims at ſovereignty. The claims of rightful ſovereigns are founded in juſtice and truth; to aſſert thoſe claims, they need not depart from the rules of honour and humanity; for theſe will beſt ſerve, and are moſt ſuitable to their purpoſe: Uſurpers invade the rights of others; breach of faith, perſecution, carnag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and cruelty muſt therefore mark their progreſs; for theſe only can inſure ſucceſs to their ambitious views.</p>
            <p>Every friend to humanity muſt lament that the mild and generous ſpirit of Government has not met with more deſerving objects—that hitherto its advances towards reconciliation and peace have been loſt on the rebels, who have aſcribed them to fear and pufilanimity. In this, they probably judge of others by themſelves; for thoſe who have no generous ſentiments of their own, will ſcarcely recognize them in others. With their loyalty, the leaders of this rebellion ſeem to have renounced all regard to humanity, juſtice and truth; as might be proved by a thouſand inſtances, beſides the caſe of Major Andre. To thoſe who are not acquainted with their principles and proceedings, a juſt character of them would appear little better than ſatyr and invective. But it may be averred with the ſtricteſt truth—that inſolence in proſperity, or where they have power—crouching meanneſs in adverſity, and duplicity in both, are their eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed characteriſtics. On ſuch men, there can be no other tie than that of <hi>Fear.</hi>—Nothing elſe can reſtrain or bind them.</p>
            <p>Lord Clarendon, in the motto prefixed to theſe papers, obſerves,
<q>that if there were no other brand upon the odious and accurſed civil war of his time, than the ſingle leſs of Lord Falkland, it muſt be moſt infamous and execrable to all poſterity.</q>
Lord Falkland was <hi>accidentally</hi> killed in battle: Major Andre, contrary to every principle of juſtice and humanity, was <hi>deliberately,</hi> put to death by the leaders of this rebellion; and his character greatly reſembled that of Lord Falkland, as it is deſcribed by the noble hiſtorian. How much more infamous and execrable muſt the preſent rebellion be therefore in this reſpect, than the former!</p>
            <p>Lord Falkland and Major Andre were both cut off in the bloom of life, and when the higheſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations were entertained of them. Both were poſſeſſed of an uncommon ſhare of genius—a taſte for the liberal arts—a lively fancy—a ſolid judgment, improved by extenſive reading.

to effect a meaſure which he thought would go far towards terminating this deſtructive rebellion, without the effuſion of blood, induced him to depart from the orders of his General, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the danger that threatened. Both theſe illuſtrious perſons fell, equally lamented by their friends, and revered by their enemies.</p>
            <p>A few particulars concerning the capture and execution of Major Andre, ſhall cloſe theſe remarks.</p>
            <p>He was ſtopped, in his return to New-York, at Tarry Town, a ſmall village on the eaſtern bank of Hudſon's River, about fifteen miles from Kingſbridge, by three peaſants, whoſe names were Paulding, Van Wert, and Williams. Major Andre aſked them ſome queſtions, and their anſwers led him to believe they were loyaliſts. This induced him to declare himſelf a Britiſh officer, and prevented his ſhewing General Arnold's paſſport at firſt, which would have ſecured him from interruption. The glory of apprehending a Britiſh officer, and the proſpect of a high reward, made them deaf to every remonſtrance—they carried him to a Col. Jameſon of the rebel militia, by whom he was conveyed to General Waſhington. All the particulars of any conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that intervened between this and his execution, are mentioned in the narrative of his caſe.</p>
            <p>Among other amiable qualities, Major Andre had the niceſt feelings of honour and decorum. Though perfectly reſigned, when his doom was announced, yet he was ſhocked at the thought of dying on a gibbet. Provided he was put to death, and made the victim of policy, he did not conceive that the <hi>mode</hi> of his death could be an object of any moment to his enemies. Filled with this fond opinion, he wrote to General Waſhington the following letter, in which we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognize the delicacy of ſentiment, and manly fortitude which diſtinguſhed the author.</p>

with the commanding aſpect and behaviour of thoſe they were ſent to execute, that they were unable to do their office. Something ſimilar happened, we are aſſured, at Major Andre's death.
