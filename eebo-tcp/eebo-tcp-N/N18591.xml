            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>That the time may ſpeedily arrive, when each ſtate will be compelled to let the hapleſs African ſleep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed upon his native ſhore, is the fervent prayer of THOUSANDS! The Poet beautifully ſings,</p>

            <p>TO adore our Almighty Maker, to confide in the Lord Redeemer, and to exerciſe genuine benevolence towards all mankind, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly include both our duty and happineſs in the preſent ſtate. To the firſt we are bound as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable creatures; to the ſecond, we are encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by the goſpel, as periſhing ſinners; and to the laſt we are obliged as ſocial beings, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with multitudes of our own ſpecies.— To promote this worſhip of God our Creator, this confidence in Chriſt the Redeemer, and this cordial affection for our neighbours, in the great end of an evangelical miniſtry, and of all divine inſtitutions that are of a religious kind. For this end are we now aſſembled; and to plead the cauſe of moral juſtice, of true benevolence, and of compaſſion, relative to the poor oppreſſed Africans, I have read that part of ſacred writ
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:024128_0004_0FC3B3B5A3A2C1C8"/>which is now before us. Yes, my brethren, I now ſtand to bear a public teſtimony againſt that diverſified iniquity, which is inſeparable from a commerce in the human ſpecies—that commerce which is called the <hi>Slave-Trade,</hi> together with its numerous and horrid conſequences.</p>
            <p>That ſlavery againſt which I am going to plead is not of a civil or political kind, but entirely of a <hi>perſonal</hi> nature. For though it is much to be wiſhed that liberty, in a civil and political ſenſe, may be enjoyed and ſlouriſh without licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in all the nations of the earth; yet I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought ſubjects of that nature proper to be diſcuſſed in the pulpit, and eſpecially on the Lord's day. But the exerciſe of moral juſtice, of benevolence, and of humanity, being enforced by every principle of evangelical truth; an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to promote thoſe virtuous affections to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward our extremely degraded and oppreſſed fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures, the Negroes, muſt be completely conſiſtent with the commands of divine law, the grace of the glorious goſpel, and the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of public worſhip.</p>
            <p>It may be proper for me here to remark, that it is not againſt <hi>perſonal</hi> ſlavery, as abſolutely, univerſally, and in every poſſible caſe, evil, that I am going to ſpeak. By no means. For a man may ſo violate the laws and rights of ſociety, as juſtly to forfeit his liberty; as to deſerve ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry— <hi>ſlavery,</hi> in a ſtrict and proper ſenſe—that he may be an example to others, and compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate, as far as lies in his power, the injuries done to ſociety by an abuſe of his own liberty. Yet
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:024128_0005_0FC3B3B7348ED580"/>even in this caſe, the holding of his poſterity, not guilty of ſimilar crimes, in a ſtate of ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, would be a flagrant violation of juſtice. It is then, againſt the ſtealing, the purchaſing, and the enſlaving of innocent perſons, that I intend to argue—<hi>innocent,</hi> not in a moral, but in a civil ſenſe. For if we conſider ourſelves as the ſubjects of Jehovah's moral government, we are all guilty; we all deſerve to periſh, and lie at his merey: nor would any man have the leaſt ground of complaint againſt the divine conduct, were eternal juſtice to plunge him in final ruin. But with regard to that relation in which men ſtand to a ſecular ſovereign, and as members of civil ſociety, the caſe is widely different. For here they may be <hi>innocent;</hi> and, being ſo, are completely entitled to perſonal freedom.</p>
            <p>In purſuance of my deſign, I ſhall now ſhow, That the law in our text, though given to the ancient Hebrews as a body politic, proceeds on a moral ground—That though God, in certain caſes, permitted the Iſraelites to purchaſe their fellow-creatures for ſervitude; yet that purchaſe and ſervitude were attended with ſuch reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as rendered them eſſentially different from the European Slave-Trade and its conſequences. That ſuppoſing God had permitted the Iſraelit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh people to traffic in the human ſpecies, and to enſlave the Gentiles in a much greater degree than he did; it would not have warranted the conduct of Europeans toward the Africans.— And, that the European commerce in man, and the ſlavery conſequent upon it, are abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imical
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:024128_0006_0FC3B3B8A2C6C178"/>to the precepts of Jeſus Chriſt, and the whole tenor of his doctrine.</p>
            <p>FIRST, <hi>The law in our text, though given to the ancient Hebrews as a body politic, proceeds on a moral ground.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That no great labour of proof is neceſſary to evince the truth of this propoſition, a ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of reflection will ſhow. For though the divine law before us was manifeſtly given to the Iſraelites, as part of their judicial code, and was intended to regulate their conduct one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another; yet it no leſs apparently proceeds on the ſame principle with that prohibition of the decalogue, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal.</hi> So Paul, with reference perhaps to this very paſſage, ſays, <hi>The law is not made for a righteous man, but for —murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manſlayers, for whoremongens, for them that defile themſelves with mankind, for</hi> MEN-STEAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ERS, <hi>for liars, for perijured perſons.</hi> Man-ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is here claſſed with ſuch crimes as are moſt deteſtable in the ſight of God, moſt pernicious to ſociety and moſt deſerving of death by the ſword of the civil magiſtrate. Manſtealing, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, muſt be conſidered as a moral evil—univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally evil, in every age and in every nation. Nor is it only an evil, but one of the firſt magnitude againſt our neighbour. If he who pilfers any one's property, ſteals a ſheep, robs on the high road, or commits a burglary, be conſidered and treated as a thief, a robber, a peſt of ſociety; of what enormous villainy muſt he be guilty, who kidnaps my honeſt neighbour, my faithful
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024128_0007_0FC3B3BA2E18DF70"/>ſervant, my dutiful child, or my affectionate wife, to tranſport the one or the other to a country entirely unknown, and never thence to return! This outrage on the ſacred rights of liberty, of juſtice, and of humanity, is greatly enhanced, if that worſt of thieves intend, either to treat them himſelf as the moſt abject of ſlaves, like thoſe in the Britiſh Weſt-Indies; or to ſell them for that moſt infamous and cruel purpoſe. In either of theſe caſes, and much more when both are united, reaſon and conſcience, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſentiments and feelings of mankind, will all unite, if not debauched by avarice, or blunted by habit, in approving this law of Jehovah as juſt; <hi>He that ſtealeth a man and ſelleth him, or if he be found in his hand,</hi> HE SHALL SURELY BE PUT TO DEATH. Nor is there a man upon earth, not even among thoſe who are grown hoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the trade of manſtealing, or of bartering "brandy and baubles" for human fleſh and blood; that would not execrate the character of him to whoſe power of ſubtilty he had fallen a victim for fimilar purpoſes, and that would not pronounce him <hi>worthy of death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if this law of the Lord, given to the ancient Hebrews, be founded on a ſtrictly moral principle; if it reſt on the broad baſis of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rectitude, of juſtice, and of humanity; as the manſtealer himſelf deſerves to die for his fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitious crime, the <hi>purchaſer</hi> of thoſe who are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the victims of his avarice, cannot be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted innocent. <hi>Innnoent!</hi> far from it! For his known, or, at leaſt, ſuppoſed readineſs to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024128_0008_0FC3B3BBABF20000"/>buy unoffending fellow-creatures, is generally the <hi>principal</hi> motive to the commiſſion of the horrid theft. There is a vulgar ſaying, "If there were no receivers, there would be no thieves." It is on the principle of that old obſervation the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal law of this country proceeds, in puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the purchaſers of ſtolen goods, knowing them to be ſtolen: and it is much to be lamented, that this part of our criminal code ſhould have no force, relative to Britiſh ſubjects, who purchaſe on the coaſts of Africa, not a little deſpicable property, but innocent <hi>perſons,</hi> knowing, or hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the higheſt poſſible preſumptive reaſon to believe, that they were ſtolen! How inſulting to moral juſtice, and how affronting to common ſenſe, that thoſe very perſons who, in England, would be flogged at the cart's tail, or perhaps tranſported to Botany Bay, for ſecretly purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing five ſhillings worth of property, knowing it to have been ſtolen, ſhould have it in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er publicly to buy and ſell whole families of ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, innocent Africans, with complete impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and without violating any prohibitory law of the land! As if rectitude and robbery were local things! the former loſing its reſpectability, and the latter its turpitude, whenever the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and the lives of harmleſs Negroes become the object of Britiſh avarice! Or as if it were equally conſiſtent with private juſtice and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal honour, actually to fit out a number of ſhips, furniſhed with manacles, chains, and fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for cargoes of harmleſs men and women; as it is for the Greenland traders to equip others,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024128_0009_0FC3B3BD2E30CC70"/>for the capturing and ſtowage of all that is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable in whales and ſeals!—It being apparent then, that the law under conſideration reſts on a moral ground, I ſhall proceed to ſhow,</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, <hi>That though God, in certain caſes, permitted the Iſrealites to purchaſe their fellow-creatures for ſervitude; yet that purchaſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude were attended with ſuch reſtrictions, as rendered them eſſentially different from the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rean Slave-Trade and its conſequences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There were two caſes in which an Iſraelite himſelf might, according to divine law, be ſold into a ſtate of ſervitude. Theſe were, <hi>theft</hi> and <hi>inſolvency.</hi> Relative to the <hi>former,</hi> the Moſaic ſtatute runs thus: <hi>If a man ſhall ſteal an ox, or a ſheep, and kill it, or ſell it; he ſhall reſtore five oxen for an ox, and four ſheep for a ſheep— If a thief have nothing, then he ſhall be ſold for his theft.</hi>

            <p>The Moſaic ſtatutes permitted <hi>inſolvent</hi> debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors to be ſold for the benefit of their creditors: but then the ſervitude to which ſuch debtors were obliged, was far from being oppreſſive and cruel.

            <p>There is great reaſon to conclude, that the divine permiſſion which is under our notice, was limited to the remains of thoſe Canaanitiſh nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the extermination of which had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to Iſrael. To this concluſion we are led by the following conſiderations. Divine law, as already obſerved, was far from authorizing the choſen tribes to viſit diſtant continents, in order to capture or to purchaſe their fellow-creatures,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024128_0013_0FC3B3CC33AC7848"/>either for their own uſe, or to barter with other nations; making commerce in the human ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies an eſtabliſhed article of their trade, which, to our immorral infamy, is now the caſe with us. No: the attention of the Iſraelites, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this inſtance of Jehovah's pleaſure, was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the neighbouring Gentile ſtates, and to them only. Though the natives of Gentile nations in general, when reſiding among the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites, were denominated <hi>ſtrangers;</hi> and tho' none of them were to be treated with cruelty, yet the Moſaic laws did not conſider them as all on a level, or as equally entitled to the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Hebrews. For while God permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſome of thoſe aliens to be purchaſed and placed in the ſtate of <hi>bondſervants,</hi> which was expreſsly prohibited, with regard to any Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite; he required, in the very ſame chapter, that others of them, if oppreſſed with poverty, ſhould experience all that compaſſion which was due to the deſcendants of Abraham, when in a ſimilar ſituation. Reſpecting this particular, the law was: <hi>If thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee, then thou ſhalt relieve him; yea, though he be a</hi> STRANJER, <hi>or a</hi> SOJOURNER, <hi>that he may live with thee</hi>

                  <hi>Lev.</hi> xxv. 35.</note> Hence ariſes no ſmall degree of preſumptive evidence, that none but ſtrangers of the Canaanitiſh race were to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for <hi>bondſervants.</hi> It does not appear, that the Iſraelites were warned by their Eternal Sovereign, to carry their arms into diſtant coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024128_0014_0FC3B3CDA5F2A920"/>except when thoſe countries were the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors. Their commiſſion to invade, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugate, or to deſtroy, was limited, if I be not under a great miſtake, to the flagitious inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the land; which, by a divine grant, had been expreſsly conſigned to Abraham and his poſterity. It is natural to conclude, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the law which authorized the deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of Abraham to purchaſe fellow-creatures of the Heathens around them for <hi>bondſervants,</hi> had its operation limited to the remains of thoſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanitiſh nations. The hiſtory of the Gibeonites is, if I miſtake not, perfectly conformable to this view of the caſe. Thoſe Hivites conſtituted a part of the Cannanitiſh nations whom God had ordered to be ſubdued. Alarmed with appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of impending ruin, they, by an act of deception, made a league with Iſrael, preſerved their own lives, and were permitted to dwell among the choſen people: but, as an expreſſion of reſentment againſt their diſingenuity, and as a mark of their being part of thoſe nations againſt whom the ſeverity of puniſhment had been denounced, they were placed in a ſtate of inferiority, and occupied in mean employments.<note n="*" place="bottom">Joſhua <hi>ix.</hi>

No: the lives even of the Canaanitiſh people were not, by cruel bondage, rendered a burden to them: for though, in a <hi>comparative</hi> ſenſe, they were ſlaves, and excluded from reſpectable ſtations, yet they were under the protection of divine law, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the rights of men, though not of citizens. An eſſentially different ſituation, therefore, from that of the Negro Slaves in our plantations!</p>
            <p>As the caſe of thoſe Canaanitiſh Heathens is the only thing which, in the law of Moſes, and in the authorized conduct of the Iſraelites, bears almoſt any reſemblance to that perſonal ſlavery againſt which I plead; it may be expedient, briefly to enquire into the reaſons of it. Be it
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:024128_0016_0FC3B3D0C5B5D290"/>obſerved then, that God, being the Creator of all things, is the univerſal Proprietor. No one has either liberty or life, except by a grant from God: If therefore that grant be recalled, men ceaſe to have any claim to thoſe deareſt of all temporal enjoyments. Mankind having revolted from God, and rebelled againſt him, they have univerſally forfeited their all to Eternal Juſtice. God may therefore juſtly deprive them of their property, their liberty, or their lives, according to his own ſovereign pleaſure, without being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to any of his creatures. The Canaan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itiſh nations, it is evident, were <hi>extremely wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>See Lev.</hi> xviii. 6—30.</note> The univerſal Sovereign might, therefore, with apparent propriety make them, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent world, examples of his juſtice: that not only his choſen people, but others, in diſtant countries, might learn to revere his righteous government, and ſtand in awe of his terrible judgments. He was perfectly at liberty, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to permit the Iſraelites to purchaſe thoſe Canaanites for <hi>bondſervants,</hi> and to inflict ſuch hardſhips upon them as he pleaſed. Nay, he might not only permit, but expreſsly <hi>command</hi> them, to treat thoſe devoted people in ſuch a manner as would have been enormouſly criminal, detached from that command. Thus, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it would have been highly criminal for the Iſraelites to have invaded the Canaanitiſh country, had not he who is the Univerſal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor, and Abſolute Sovereign, ordered them
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024128_0017_0FC3B3D232E720C0"/>ſo to do. But, as that land was his own; as, by a divine grant, it had been conſigned to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's poſterity; and as the tribes of Jacob were ordered to invade the country, to ſubdue its inhabitants, and to take poſſeſſion, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in ſo doing was lawful. It would have been ſtill more criminal for the choſen ſeed to have attempted, not only the conqueſt, but alſo the <hi>extermination</hi> of thoſe devoted nations, had not the Lord commanded it. But he, by whoſe command they were to be extirpated, was equally at liberty to order their execution by the ſword of Iſrael, as to have deſtroyed them by an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake, by the peſtilence, or, as in the caſe of Sodom, by fire from heaven.—It is on this ground, as I conceive, that the Moſaic laws re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to <hi>bondſervants</hi> proceed; the degrading ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice itſelf being ſubjected to the fore-mentioned limitations—I muſt now ſhow,</p>
            <p>THIRDLY, <hi>That ſuppoſing God had permitted the Iſraelitiſh people to traffic in the human ſpecies, and to enſlave the Gentiles in a much greater de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree than he did, it would not have authorized the conduct of Europeans towards the Africans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To prove and illuſtrate this poſition, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particulars may not be impertinent. The Iſraelites, as a body politic, were the peculiar people of God, in diſtinction from all other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions then upon earth. But this is not the caſe, with any people now in the world. While the Moſaic Diſpenſation continued, that ſingular and high prerogative was excluſively enjoyed by the Jews: but when the Chriſtian Economy was
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024128_0018_0FC3B3D3B2587D20"/>eſtabliſhed, that prerogative ceaſed; nor did any other nation ſucceed to the honour. If the Engliſh, for inſtance, the Dutch, the French, or the Spaniards, were to claim the privilege; it would behove them to produce the divine char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by which it was granted. But it is manifeſt that no ſuch authority can be adduced. God, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſublimeſt of all names, JEHOVAH, was not only the object of religious worſhip to the choſen people; but alſo their political monarch. The whole ſtatute law of that kingdom, as well judicial, as moral and religious, was of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting: and on the obſerving that ſyſtem of law which was promulgated by Jehovah, their nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal happineſs depended. Now it is plain from what has been ſaid, that the divine ſtatute which authorized the Hebrews to purchaſe perſons of the nations around them for <hi>bond-ſervants,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the judicial part of their legal code. But what nation pretends now to be governed by a ſyſtem of law that is divine, or to have Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah for its political ſovereign? The Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitiſh country was, by Jehovah, expreſsly given to the Iſraelites for their inheritance; which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it lawful for them to conquer and poſſeſs it. But what nation in Europe has the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to a divine grant of any particular diſtrict on the African continent? Divine juſtice doom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the profligate and impious Canaanitiſh nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to deſtruction, or to a low ſtate of ſubjuga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and Abraham's poſterity were expreſsly appointed to execute the ſentence. But to which of the European powers has God committed the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024128_0019_0FC3B3D52D9B9150"/>execution of ſimilar judgments upon the Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans? Thoſe whom Jehovah permitted his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to buy, for a comparative degree of ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, were to be, either Canaanites reſiding among them, or perſons of the ſame deſcription in the nations around them. But will this warrant our having recourſe to a diſtant continent, for the purpoſe of purchaſing and enſlaving its innocent inhabitants? Thoſe Gentiles whom God permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Hebrews to buy, were to be employed in low ſervices among themſelves. But will this juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the Engliſh, or any commercial people, in purchaſing Negroes and ſelling them to other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions? The <hi>former</hi> were treated as <hi>men,</hi> who, in the divine eſtimation, had forfeited the rights of citizens; but the <hi>latter,</hi> like <hi>beaſts</hi> of burden, or as articles of mere commerce. Canaanitiſh bond-ſervants, among the Iſraelites, were under the protection of divine law, which prohibited the exerciſe of cruelty upon them. But will any defender of Weſt-India ſlavery pretend, that our Colonial laws afford an equal degree of protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the poor Negroes?</p>
            <p>Again: The ancient diſtinction between Jews and Gentiles being entirely aboliſhed, by the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine eſtabliſhment of Chriſtianity, thoſe preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives that were peculiar to Judaiſm and its profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, do not now exiſt: among which preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, the right of purchaſing Gentiles for bond-ſervants is to be claſſed. Conſequently, it is now as criminal and wicked for Europeans, either to ſteal, or to purchaſe and ſell, the innocent Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans for ſlaves, as it would have been for the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:024128_0020_0FC3B3D6A6CE7E78"/>to have ſtolen, ſold, and enſlaved one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: which, nevertheleſs, as appears from our text itſelf, was abſolutely forbidden under the ſevereſt of all temporal penalties. Nay, ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own countrymen, for inſtance, could prove, that they have ſucceeded to the ancient Iſraelitiſh prerogative reſpecting this matter; yet, from the particulars adduced in the preceding paragraph, it is apparent, that their conduct would ſtand condemned by the Moſaic law. This would be more ſtrikingly evident ſtill, were I to lay before you the decetiful arts and iniquitous violence which are frequently uſed to obtain the poor Africans in their own country—the cruel manner in which they are ſtowed on board the ſhips, when tranſported to the Weſt-India iſlands; the brutal mode of expoſing them to ſale when there—the inhuman ſeparation of brothers and ſiſters, of parents and children, of huſbands and wives, on that infamous occaſion—and the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty with which they are generally treated, when employed in the ſugar iſlands<note n="*" place="bottom">See an Abſtract of the Evidence before a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Committee of the Houſe of Commons, relative to the Slave-Trade.</note>. For were theſe things deſcribed in detail, as they appear in the teſtimonies of numerous reſpectable witneſſes—they would make your ears tingle—they would ſhock your tender feelings—they would rouſe your indignation againſt a trade ſo degrading to humanity, and ſo enormouſly wicked.</p>
            <p>Further: Suppoſing the lawfulneſs of purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024128_0021_0FC3B3D824BA86E0"/>and of enſlaving our innocent fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were granted, it would be natural to aſk—For <hi>whom</hi> is it lawful, and on <hi>what deſcription</hi> of unoffending perſons does the exerciſe of that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic right fall? Is it lawful for the Engliſh, the French, the Europeans in general, to buy and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave the Africans? But whence did they, rather than thoſe very Africans, derive that dreadful right? I ſay, <hi>dreadful</hi> right. For the idea of any individual, or of any people, poſſeſſing au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to treat the innocent as if they were fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitiouſly guilty, is hateful, and ſhocking to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to conſcience, and to common ſenſe.—Whence, then, I demand, is that authority de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived? From the Europeans profeſſing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, the Africans in queſtion being Pagans?—But, as thoſe Pagans are men, are neighbours, are brethren of the human kind, ſo Chriſtianity is the religion of truth and juſtice, of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and of peace. It inſpires them by whom it is known, and not diſgraced, with love to God and love to their neighbours: Whereas the <hi>traffic in</hi> MAN is unjuſt and cruel, is barbarous and ſavage. Does, then, the right in queſtion originate in divine law, as given to the ancient Iſraelites? but thoſe laws that were peculiar to the Hebrew theocracy, have long been obſolete; nor, were they in full force, would the preſent MAN-<hi>trade</hi> be countenanced by them. As to that part of the Jewiſh law, which is properly and ſtrictly ſpeaking <hi>moral,</hi> the obligation of which extends to all mankind in every age; it forbids nothing to an African, that is equitable
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024128_0022_0FC3B3D9B2B83120"/>in the conduct of a European. It knows no more of a <hi>white</hi> man buying and enſlaving a <hi>black</hi> one, than it does of the <hi>latter</hi> ſo treating the <hi>former.</hi> In its impartial eſtimate, and under its command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power, Africans and Europeans, Pagans and Chriſtians, are all on a level. Muſt the right under conſideration, then, be inferred from what is called the law of <hi>nature?</hi> But that is the ſame in Africa, as it is in Europe; entirely the ſame all over the globe. According to this law, be the ſtation of an <hi>innocent</hi> Negro ever ſo obſcure, his poverty ever ſo great, his manners ever ſo rude, or his mental capacities ever ſo contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he has an equal claim to perſonal liberty with any man upon earth. For the rights of humanity being common to the whole of our ſpecies, are the ſame in every part of the world.</p>
            <p>It follows, therefore, that if the lawfulneſs of purchaſing innocent perſons for the moſt degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and cruel ſlavery exiſt among men, it muſt be a common right, and equally poſſeſſed by all nations: nor can the exerciſe of it have any li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation from principles of a <hi>moral</hi> nature. No limits can be here aſſigned, except thoſe of power, of policy, or of inclination. It would, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, be quite as equitable, benevolent, and humane, for the Africans, laden with produce of their own country, annually to viſit our Engliſh ports, as we do theirs, and for ſimilar purpoſes. Yes, they might, if it were in their power, with equal juſtice, and with leſs diſhonour, fit out an hundred and eighty, or two hundred ſhips, for the port of London, of Briſtol, and of Liver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pool—ſhips
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:024128_0023_0FC3B3DB2AC4B718"/>adapted to the <hi>ſtowage of</hi> MAN, and furniſhed with a frightful apparatus, to render the confinement of Britons completely miſerable, as well as perfectly ſecure. When this commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, this <hi>man</hi>-trading fleet arrived, if cargoes of men, women, and children were not prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the officers belonging to each veſſel might practiſe all their arts, to excite a ſpirit of covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and of cruelty in our governors and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſubjects; in order that, by an armed force, the peaceable inhabitants of whole villages might be captured—that, in our courts of juſtice, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent perſons, for the advantage of their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, might be convicted—that private individuals might kidnap whomſoever they could, and thought ſaleable—that, by all theſe infamous means, the ſhips might be freighted, at every returning ſeaſon, with 40,000 Britons—and, finally, that all who ſurvive their miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement while on board, might be taken to the beſt market for the human ſpecies; expoſed, in the moſt indecent manner, to public ſale; han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled and examined, like ſo many head of cattle, by their purchaſers; conſigned over, with their unborn poſterity, to the moſt abject and cruel ſlavery, from generation to generation; and all for—what? Here let humanity bluſh, let mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy weep, and let juſtice be rouſed into indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but let not Britons forget, that this is a picture, in miniature, of their own behaviour towards the Africans!</p>
            <p>Once more: Were the conduct of our man-merchants lawful, neither the principles of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:024128_0024_0FC3B3DCA813B460"/>nor thoſe of religon, could lie in the way of their buying, and ſelling for ſlaves, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent natives of Holland or France, or any other neighbouring nation. For as it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to prove, that the natural rights of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity are not equally ſacred in Africa, as they are in Europe; ſo the cruel and bloody hand of rapacity might with equal juſtice lay hold of the Dutchman, or the Frenchman, as of the ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Guineaman. Nor, other things being equal, is there the leaſt reaſon for us to imagine, that the white ſkin of a European would afford any more protection againſt a violent ſeizure, than does the black ſkin of an African. No: had the trader in <hi>man</hi> an equal opportunity of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying his cruel avarice; were he equally ſure of impunity, and no more expoſed to infamy, in the one caſe than in the other; the ſame diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to juſtice, and the ſame principle of ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, would have a ſimilar operation on the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of neighbouring Europeans, as they have on the poor Negroes. Nay, he who is, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, a Negro Merchant; whoſe buſineſs it is to buy and ſell his fellow-creatures, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their guilt, or their innocence; who has been in that practice for a courſe of years; who is habituated to it and hardened in it, ſo that he carries on his iniquitous commerce without remorſe or ſhame, in the face of the ſun, cannot be conſidered as reſtrained by any religious or virtuous principle, though he never attempted to purchaſe, for Weſt-India ſlavery, any of his peaceable neighbours in <hi>this</hi> country. No: would
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024128_0025_0FC3B3DE31EAD6D0"/>the laws and cuſtoms of the land permit, as in former times,<note n="*" place="bottom">As in former times. <hi>Relative to this fact, Dr.</hi> Henry <hi>ſays; Shives ſtill continue to he a capital article, both in the internal and foreign trade of Britain. When an eſtate was conveyed from one proprietor to another, all the villains or ſlaves annexed to that eſtate were conveyed at the ſame time, and by the ſame deed. When any perſon had more children than he could maintain, or more domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſlaves than he thoſe to keep, he ſold them to a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, who diſpoſed of them either at home or abroad, as he found would be moſt profitable.</hi> It was a common vice (<hi>ſays</hi> Giraldus Cambrenſis) of the Engliſh, when they were reduced to poverty, that rather than endure it patiently, they expoſed their own children to ſale. <hi>Many of theſe unhappy perſons were carried into Ireland, and no doubt into other countries, and there ſold.

It appears therefore, with ſuperior evidence, That the European commerce in man, and the ſlavery connected with it, are abſolutely indefenſible on the grounds of the Jewiſh law— I now proceed to ſhow,</p>
            <p>FOURTHLY, <hi>That the European Commerce in Man, and the Slavery conſequent upon it, are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely inimical to the precepts of Jeſus Chriſt, and to the whole ſcope of his Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the</hi> PRECEPTS <hi>of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: <hi>Love your enemies. Do good to them that hate you.</hi> Now, is not the whole of that ſyſtem againſt which I plead, at irreconcilable enmity with the ſpirit of theſe divine precepts? If our ſovereign Lord require genuine benevolence and active love to our <hi>enemies,</hi> he certainly cannot be ſatisfied with a leſs degree of ſocial regard, and virtuous affection, towards thoſe who are <hi>not</hi> our enemies—thoſe who never did us any evil; who never had it in their power to injure us; and who, perhaps, never heard of us. To treat <hi>ſuch</hi> perſons as if they had notoriouſly injured us in our deareſt intereſts, and as if they were our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable enemies, muſt be abſolutely contrary to the divine requiſition in theſe precepts, and to every dictate of moral duty. Yet ſuch are the Negro Trade and its conſequences, that the moſt diabolical malice, which ever exiſted in the heart of man againſt his bittereſt enemy, could ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly contrive or with more aggravated miſery to befall him in this life, than that under which
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:024128_0027_0FC3B3E125A6B3D0"/>many thouſands of innocent, captured, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved Africans groan.</p>
            <p>Again: <hi>All things whatſoever ye would, that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them,</hi> is another of our Lord's precepts. This admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly juſt and comprehenſive command, requires each of us to treat every man, as we might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably wiſh every one to treat us, were ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and circumſtances reverſed. It conſiders every man AS a man, and requires that he be ſo treated. It impartially views every man, as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capacities, feelings, and rights, peculiar to his own ſpecies: and it forbids thoſe capacities to be inſulted by degradation, thoſe feelings by unmerited pain, and thoſe rights by injuſtice.— But is not the horrid MAN-<hi>trade,</hi> and the deteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table connections in which it ſtands, a manifeſt outrage on this moſt ſalutary precept? Do not that inhuman commerce, and the conſequent cruel ſlavery, treat vaſt multituds of human crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as if they had no ſhare in the capacities, the feelings, or the rights of men? as if they were mere <hi>brutes,</hi> made to be taken and ſold, enſlaved and deſtroyed? He, therefore, who dares to vindicate ſuch conduct might, on his <hi>own</hi> principles, be juſtly kidnapped, bought and fold, for a ſimilar ſtate of ſlavery. Becauſe, whatever arguments prove that <hi>any</hi> innocent man has an inviolable claim to perſonal freedom, will equally prove the ſame thing reſpecting <hi>every</hi> one of that character.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>All things whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them.</hi> This has been
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:024128_0028_0FC3B3E2B2681938"/>frequently called, THE GOLDEN RULE. It re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends itſelf to every man's reaſon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, as completely wiſe and good. Every one implicitly appeals to it as worthy of the higheſt regard, when his own rights are violated by his neighbour: nor muſt even the Negro merchants, or the ſlave-holders, be conſidered as inſenſible to the excellence of this moral precept, when their own perſons, families, or intereſts, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. For who among all the traders in man, and holders of ſlaves, would think himſelf treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with equity, were he, after having been kid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napped by a villain, to find his bones and ſinews, his bowels and blood, expoſed to ſale, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually purchaſed by one whoſe profeſſion it was to <hi>trade in the perſons of men?</hi>

Nay, would not his indignation and anguiſh be greatly heightened, if poſſible, were his affectionate wife and his dutiful children in the ſame ſituation; juſt go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be ſeparated, and never more to ſee one another? The very thought of ſuch a cataſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phe ſtings with diſtreſs; and yet if any man upon earth deſerves to be ſo treated, it muſt be he who has made it his buſineſs to buy and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave his innocent fellow-creatures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the</hi> DOCTRINE <hi>of Chriſt.</hi> This doctrine is denominated <hi>the goſpel,</hi> or <hi>glad tidings,</hi> by way of eminence. Yes, my Brethren, it is glad
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:024128_0029_0FC3B3E42A9E1478"/>tidings of pardon, of peace, and of life eternal, through Jeſus Chriſt, for periſhing ſinners.— The goſpel, ſtrictly ſo called, is the doctrine of divine benevolence to man; of mercy to the miſerable, and of grace to the unworthy. It reveals Jeſus Chriſt as <hi>coming into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi> Its whole buſineſs is with thoſe that are juſtly condemned by divine law, and who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to periſh. In this gracious goſpel the Lord Redeemer addreſſes Jews and Gentiles, Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Africans, without any difference; and his charming language is, <hi>Look unto Me, and he ye ſaved, all ye ends of the earth. Come unto Me, all ye that labour, and and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt. Him that cometh unto Me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Such are the benign import, and the benevolent deſign of our Lord's doctrine! Conſequently, its natural tendency muſt be to produce and promote love to God, and love to man. But nothing can be more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imical to that devout and kind affection, than the buying, the ſelling, and the enſlaving of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent fellow-creatures. For that commerce and ſlavery originate in the baſeſt avarice; are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on by injuſtice and cruelty, and iſſue in the miſery and murder of thouſands, who have an equal claim to liberty and to happineſs with our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>Were you, my Brethren, mutually to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the character of a <hi>Slave Merchant,</hi> it would be ſound, I preſume, to include the following particulars. He is, by profeſſion, a buyer and ſeller of men, women, and children. If not a
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:024128_0030_0FC3B3E5A912D0F8"/>kidnapper himſelf, he encourages, rewards, and rejoices in the practice: for without it his trade would be at a ſtand. Inſtead of delighting in the domeſtic happineſs of others, univerſally, he makes it his buſineſs violently to ſeparate the neareſt and deareſt relatives: for conjugal, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental, and fraternal ties, are by him diſſolved without the leaſt remorſe. So far is he from ſympathizing with widows and orphans, as ſuch, in their afflictions, that the diſtreſſes of multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes under thoſe characters, ariſe from his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. Such is the nature of his employment, that it cannot ſucceed, without his fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures being deprived of their moſt ſacred natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rights: becauſe, for numbers to be diveſted of their perſonal freedom, their mental tranqili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, their ſocial connections, their bodily eaſe, and their pittance of property, is eſſential to the joy of his gain. His profeſſion is, as a man of buſineſs, to provide victims for abject ſlavery, for pinching want, for capricious cruelty, for dark deſpair, and for untimely death, in its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious forms. His trade, as well as his profits, muſt ceaſe, except he diverſify and propagate human miſery. He may call himſelf a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or a diſciple of Him that <hi>went about doing good;</hi> but the amiable character is profaned by his traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic in man: for it becomes none but a ſavage, or a votary of Moloch. He may, poſſibly, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve commendation for the exerciſe of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent affections in his own family, and in the neighbourhood where he reſides; but, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a <hi>trader in</hi> MAN, he declares war againſt
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:024128_0031_0FC3B3F1866DC850"/>the dignity and happineſs of his own ſpecies; he inſults the laws of his Maker, and ſuſtains a character, that is completely fitted for univerſal abhorrence. So enormouſly criminal are the trade and the ſlavery under our notice, that, had they commenced among Britons but a few years ago, and been practiſed only by five or ſix merchants and planters, the conduct of thoſe concerned would have met with general execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; their characters would have been ſtigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with public infamy; and all intimacy with them would have been ſtudiouſly avoided by every perſon of decent morals. Nay, had the MAN-trade, the ſlavery conſequent upon it, and the execrable wickedneſs of both, been of ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent a date, practiſed by ſo few, and the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitous tranſactions laid open to public view, as they now are, there is reaſon to conclude, that various articles of commerce, produced by the ſweat, and groans, and tears of the poor Negroes, would have been conſidered by Britons as tinged with human blood. Did the man af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God's own heart, on a certain occaſion, ſay, <hi>Is not thie the blood of the men that went and jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parded their lives?</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxiii. 15, 16, 17.</note> ſo, it is probable, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of our countrymen would have ſaid, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting certain ſpecies of Weſt-India produce; <hi>Are not theſe the</hi> BLOOD <hi>of innocent men, that have been ſtolen, and bought, and ſold, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like brutes?</hi> It behoves us to remember, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that a ſyſtem of iniquity is not ſanctified by
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:024128_0032_0FC3B3F27004A9E0"/>its inveteracy, nor yet by the multitudes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it. Evidently, therefore, does it appear, that the commerce and ſlavery of which I ſpeak, are abſolutely inimical to the precepts of Chriſt, and to the whole ſcope of his doctrine, as might be more largely proved, would time permit.</p>
            <p>As our Engliſh ſeaports, Liverpool and Briſtol, are infamouſly conſpicuous in modern times, for their trading in the perſons and rights of men, ſo were Tyre and Zidon, in the ages of remote antiquity. Let us hear, then, what Jehovah ſays to the inhuman, though opulent merchants of thoſe ancient cities. Thus run the divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance, and the awful prediction: <hi>What have ye to do with me, O Tyre and Zidon, and all the coaſts of Paleſtine? Will ye render me a recompence? and if ye recompence me, ſwiftly and ſpeedily will I return your recompence upon your own head: becauſe—the children alſo of Judah and the children of Jeruſalem, have ye</hi> SOLD <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from their border. Behold! I will raiſe them out of the place whither ye have ſold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head: and I will</hi> SELL <hi>your ſons and your daughters into the hand of the children of Judah, and they ſhall ſell them to the Sabeans, to a people far off: for the Lord hath ſpoken it</hi>

It may perhaps be objected, Perſonal flavery, though authorized by the laws of Greece and Rome, and though much practiſed in the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic times, is no where expreſsly condemned in the New Teſtament: nay, Chriſtian ſlaves are exhorted lo live in peaceable ſubjection to their own maſters. To this it may be replied: Nor was the ſanguinary deſpotiſm of NERO expreſsly condemned; but the diſciples of Chriſt were commanded to behave peaceably under his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The ſports of the gladiators, autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by the Roman laws, were extremely bloody and wicked; yet are they no where expreſsly condemned by the Apoſtles. Numerous are the ſpecies of diſhoneſty and theft, which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon among us, and perhaps were ſo among peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in thoſe times; which, nevertheleſs, are not expreſsly forbidden in the New Teſtament. But, as all theſe things are breaches of moral duty; and as they are all inconſiſtent with that regard which is due to our neighbour's happineſs, it is quite ſufficient, that they are implicitly and ſtrongly forbidden by general moral principles, and by requiſitions of a contrary conduct. Any man of common ſenſe, whoſe mind is not bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſed by ſelf-intereſt, may eaſily infer, from the general principles, commands and prohibitions of Chriſtianity, that ſtealing an innocent man muſt be the worſt of rapine; that buying ſuch a kidnapped perſon is juſtifying the robbery; and that actually enſlaving him, gives a ſanction to thoſe infamous deeds, by putting a finiſhing hand
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:024128_0034_0FC3B3F56E5367D0"/>to the work of injuſtice. Beſides, as an expreſs prohibition of ſlavery might have exeited a more violent oppoſition to the Chriſtian cauſe, than almoſt any thing with which it had to conflict, ſo, neither the doctrine of Chriſt, nor the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual nature of his kingdom, require it. If the gracious goſpel found perſons in a ſtate of ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, whether civil or perſonal, it relieved their conſciences, and cheered their hearts; but it made no altenation reſpecting that ſlavery. The ſubject of a tyrannical civil governor continued to be a ſubject; and the ſlave of a private maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter continued to be a ſlave; except the governor and the maſter became acquainted with their own duty, and willing, to perform it.</p>
            <p>Having diſcuſſed my ſubject according to the plan propoſed, I ſhall now conclude with a few exhortations relative to our own duty. As being profeſſedly the followers of Chriſt, and the friends of mankind, I would exhort you, my Bretheren, <hi>carneſtly and frequently to pray for the interpoſition of Providence to aboliſh the deteſtable traffic in man.</hi> That it is our indiſpenſable duty to pray for the enlargement of our Lord's viſible kingdom among men, is plain; that the deſpiſed Africans are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally as capable of being made the ſpiritual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Jeſus Chriſtias ourſelves, ought not to be queſtioned; and that the Slave-Trade is, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, an effectual bar to the propagation of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity among them, appears with deciſive evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Nay, it is an inſuperable obſtruction to the progneſs of civilization among them, and to an honourable commerce with them. Zeal for
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:024128_0035_0FC3B3F6E973ADD8"/>the honour of God, and love for our fellow-creatures, ought therefore to inſpire us with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent prayer, that the horrid impediment may be removed, and that Chriſt may be glorified among them. Nor ought we to pray, merely that God would aboliſh the infamous commerce in man, on the ſhores of Africa; but alſo for the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual emancipation of oppreſſed Negroes in the Weſt-India iſtands: that the ſlavery of innovent perſons may ceaſe to exiſt, and ſink under the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſlation of all Europe. For what muſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved Africans in thoſe iſlands think of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, of Chriſtianity, and of Chriſt, under the tuition of their oppreſſors?</p>
            <p>Again: Let your ardent and frequent pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers be <hi>accompauied with prudent, peaceable, and ſteady efforts, in order to procure the toral aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that criminal traffic, and of the cruel ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very conſequent upon it.</hi> This is manifeſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined by the law of the Lord, <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf.</hi> A divine precept this, which requires us to do to others, as we might reaſonably wiſh them to treat us, were we in their ſituation and they in ours. When reſlect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on this branch of moral duty, with refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the caſe before us, I have ſometimes been ſtruck with the following ſuppoſed caſe: I have imagined myſelf, my family, and all my deareſt ſocial connections, with many thouſands of my countrymen, to have been kidnapped, bought, and ſold into a ſtate of cruel ſlavery. I have imagined the inhabitants of my native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in general, to have received authentic infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:024128_0036_0FC3B3F868CE4DE8"/>of the iniquitous manner in which we were captured, tranſported into a foreign land, and there enſlaved. I have ſtill further ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that extremely few among Britons had any compaſſion for us; that only here and there one would remember us in their prayers, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert any endeavours, either to relieve our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, or to prevent many thouſands of equally innocent perſons from falling, year after year, into ſimilar miſeries. I have then ſuppoſed, that, in ſuch a ſituation, I ſhould conſider Britons as quite inſenſible to the honour of national cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, to the claims of private juſtice, and to the finer feelings of civilized humanity. Nay, I have imagined that, when under paroxiſms of pain, I ſhould reflect on their mercileſs conduct with indignation; conſider them as devoted to the gain of oppreſſion; as filling up their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of national guilt; and as the deſtined ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Divine vengeance.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, I have ſuppoſed all thoſe myriads of Negroes in our Weſt-India iſlands, that are groaning under cruel ſlavery, to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the true God, and with the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of thouſands in this country, in order to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a ſpeedy abolition of the horrid traffic in man on the coaſt of Africa, and a total, but <hi>gradual</hi> abolition of ſlavery in our ſugar iſlands. I have then thought of the gratitude which muſt, on ſuch a ſuppoſition, abound in the boſoms of thoſe Negroes toward their compaſſionate friends; of the ten thouſand times ten thouſand prayers which they muſt addreſs to the Father of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:024128_0037_0FC3B3F9E40C8FB8"/>that ſucceſs may attend the cauſe of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and of humanity, in which their friends were ſincerely engaged; and of the numerous bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictione which, from their hearts, they muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce on the perſons, the families, and all the lawful purſuits of thoſe who are ſeeking to do them good.</p>
            <p>On my own mind theſe thoughts have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times made a ſtrong impreſſion, and have rouſed attention to the natural rights of oppreſſed Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans. For though they are ignorant of true God, and unacquainted with our concern to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their happineſs; yet they are <hi>men,</hi> they are <hi>brethren</hi> of the human race: agreeable to that ſaying, <hi>God hath made of one blood all nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men.</hi> Few of them, indeed, can either ſpeculate on our conduct reſpecting a meliorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ſtate, or pray for us; yet they are no leſs the proper objects of our benevolence, but rather deſerve a greater degree of compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on that account.</p>
            <p>As it is our deſign at this time to make a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection for promoting the general deſign of that worthy <hi>Society,</hi> which has exiſted for ſome years in this Metropolis, in order to <hi>effect the Aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Slave-Trade,</hi> I would earneſtly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you to make a liberal contribution for their aſſiſtance. The members of that benevolent So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety have done worthily. They deſerve the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and the thanks of every friend to moral juſtice, and to humanity. Let us therefore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſtrengthen their hands, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the righteous cauſe in which the are unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:024128_0038_0FC3B3FB702804A8"/>not doubting but the wiſdom, the rectitude, and the benevolence of our Britiſh Legiſlature, will ere long be manifeſted, in totally aboliſhing the Engliſh commerce in man; and for provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the gradual emancipation of Negro Slaves in our Weſt-India iſlands.</p>
            <p>To conclude, my Brethren, as each diſinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted individual that is tolerably well informed, reſpecting the ſubject before us, and maturely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects upon it, cannot but deteſt both the Trade and the Slavery againſt which I plead; ſo every one is bound, by the authority of God, and by the regard which is due to his own immortal intereſts, to guard againſt every corruption with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and every temptation without, that would render him a ſlave to ſin. Becauſe it is poſſible for a man to be juſt, kind, and humane to his fellow-creatures, while he is under the power of ſtrong diſaffection to God, and a ſubject of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan's domion. Having the <hi>love of God ſhead abroad in our hearts,</hi> and poſſeſſing the liberty of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, it would be incomparably better for us, after having been bought and ſold like beaſts, to be ſlaves in the Weſt-Indies; than to enjoy all the liberties of Britiſh ſubjects, and to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue under the dominion of our own depravity. For, whatever may be our ſituation as to ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar bondage, if we do but poſſeſs peace in our conſciences through atoning blood, and freedom from the power of corruption through regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating grace, we are freemen of Chriſt, and heirs of immortal glory.</p>

            <head>Extract of a letter from the worthy Author of the foregoing diſcourſe, to one of his friends in Philadelphia, daled London, January <hi>31, 1792.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE laſt Lord's day in the afternoon, I preached a Sermon, at the requeſt of the Church to which I ſtand related, in order to bear a public teſtimony, againſt that ſyſtem of <hi>enormous</hi> wickedneſs, <hi>the capturing, the buying, and the holding of Slaves, in the Weſt-India iſlands;</hi> and to make a collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the aſſiſtance of a <hi>Society</hi> in London, whoſe profeſſed intention is, if poſſible, to procure <hi>the Abolition of the Slave-Trade.</hi> We had a crouded auditory, and collected at the time £ <hi>55 10 9.</hi> A little piece was publiſhed here the laſt ſummer, intended to ſtir up the people, to <hi>lay aſide the uſe of Weſt-India Sugar and Rum;</hi> which has had an aſtoniſhing eflect. It is ſuppoſed that, in the county of Cornwall, upwards of <hi>20,000</hi> perſons have laid Sugar aſide; and the Friends of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity are now in high ſpirits, with reference to that <hi>abolition</hi> being ſoon obtained. I ſhould rejoice to hear, that not only the <hi>importation</hi> of NE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GROES into your American States were aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as I underſtand it is; but that <hi>ſlavery itſelf</hi> were utterly baniſhed from them all. For I have not a ſtronger conviction of ſcarcely any thing, than that <hi>Slave-holding</hi> (except where the Slave has forfeited his perſonal liberty by crimes againſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety) is <hi>wicked,</hi> and inconſiſtent with a Chriſtian Character. I am indeed well informed, that <hi>Slaves</hi> among the <hi>AMERICANS,</hi> are not ſo <hi>cruelly</hi> treated
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:024128_0040_0FC3B3FE69EE2180"/>as they are in the Weſt-Indies; but it is impoſſible to prove, that an innocent <hi>black</hi> man has not as much right to his perſonal liberty, as an innocent <hi>white</hi> man: and to me it is evident, that whoever would purchaſe an innocent black man, to make him a Slave, would with equal readineſs purchaſe a <hi>white</hi> one, for the ſame purpoſe, could he do it with equal impunity, and with no more diſgrace. Surely nothing can be more inconſiſtent, than zeal to maintain our <hi>civil</hi> liberty, and a diſpoſition to deprive our innocent fellow-creatures of their <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal</hi> liberty; or to continue them in <hi>Slavery,</hi> when reduced to that Abject State.</p>
