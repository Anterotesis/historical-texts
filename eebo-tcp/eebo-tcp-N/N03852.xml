            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the ſame; they approve of the Governour and Councils Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and do declare that the ſaid Scheme appears to them to be not only Illegal, but of dangerous Tendency; and muſt create great Confuſion, and Interruption in Buſineſs, as well to the Traders in New-England, as in Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and in Order that the ſaid Land-Bank may be as ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and effectually ſuppreſſed as poſſible, they are purſuing Methods to put a Stop to the ſame, until ſuch Time as the Legiſlature of Great Britain ſhall take the State of the Paper Currencies of all the Plantations into Conſideration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You deſire a particular Account of this <hi>monſtrous</hi> (as you call it) <hi>Combination,</hi> lately made, to evade Reſolves of Parliament, and King's Inſtructions; and to aſſume <hi>by Virtue of their Numbers, the eſtabliſhing of Currency,</hi> which is abſolutely the Prerogative of the Crown; you engage me to keep ſtrictly to <hi>plain Facts,</hi> without Suggeſtions, and Surmiſes of my own, or of others: Therefore to avoid all Suſpicion of Partiality, inſtead of a private Letter, I ſend it you publiſhed in the Place where is the Scene of Action.</p>
            <p>I muſt premiſe <hi>a ſhort Detail of our Plantations Paper-Effects.</hi> Upon ſome Exigencys, there not being Caſh in the Treaſury ſufficient, there was iſſued <hi>Treaſury Notes</hi> or Obligations, to be ſatisfyed, or cancelled, in a ſhort Time. The Goodneſs of the <hi>Mer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hants,</hi> to ſtrengthen the Hands of the Government, <hi>gave theſe Notes Credit as Caſh.</hi> Some Adminiſtrations took Advantage of this Credit given to their Notes, and <hi>impoſed upon the Merchant</hi> egregiouſly:</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> By Iſſuing out <hi>too large Quantities</hi> of theſe Notes with <hi>long Periods,</hi> their publick Bills of Credit ſuffered a growing Diſcount.</p>

of their own, aſſumed the KING's Prerogative in Currencies; and made their own Notes a common <hi>Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Law.</hi>

               </gap>s they encouraged Poſtponing of private Debts, which has occaſioned <hi>a general Inſenſibility of Diſcredit</hi> in all Trade, and Buſineſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly, Shop-Notes</hi> were never uſed in Payments, until publick Notes took Place, being their genuine Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring; thus Tradeſmen, Artificers, and other poor La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, are left to the Shop-keeper's Mercy, for their Pay in Goods, at any Rate.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> This gave the Hint to <hi>Combinations</hi> for emit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting private Bills of Credit, which, if not ſpeedily and effectually quaſh'd, will inevitably produce <hi>Mutiny, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> and <hi>Riots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay,</hi> we have at preſent an unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Confuſion of Paper Currency: <hi>Publick Bills of Credit,</hi> viz. The old Bills of the four Provinces of <hi>New-England,</hi> at <hi>Twenty nine Shillings</hi> per Ounce, Silver: <hi>Maſſachuſetts</hi> new Tenor, at <hi>Six Shillings and Eight Pence,</hi> but current at <hi>Nine Shillings and Eight Pence. Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut</hi> new Tenor, at <hi>Eight Shillings. Rhode-Iſland</hi> new Tenor, at <hi>Six Shillings and nine Pence.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Private Bills of Credit.</hi> 1<hi>ſt,</hi> Silver Money Scheme or <hi>Merchants Notes,</hi> whereof <hi>One hundred &amp; ten thouſand Pounds</hi> Value was emitted, <hi>Anno</hi> 1733, to prevent an enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> publick Emiſſion, from depreciating our Currency: Theſe Bills continue to be <hi>punctually paid in Gold and Silver</hi> as they become due, and are at preſent 33 <hi>per Cent.</hi> better than Province Bills.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Another Sum of <hi>Merchants Notes,</hi> value <hi>One hundred and twenty thouſand Pounds,</hi> emitted, <hi>Anno</hi> 1740,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004738_0005_100DD12343CEC310"/>
on a Silver Bottom, projected to ſtifle that pernicious <hi>grand Bubble</hi> called <hi>The Land Bank.</hi> Thoſe Bills, conſider'd ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractedly, are advantageous to the Poſſeſſor; being pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able upon Demand in a legal Currency, they are equivalent to Caſh; and carrying a growing Profit of 3 <hi>per Cent. per Annum,</hi> they are better than Province Bills, and (if other ways regular) as good as the Stocks and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies Bonds in <hi>London</hi>: The Signers without further Recourſe upon the Partnerſhip, being our moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and wealthy Traders, are capable, when required, to call in, and pay off, all their Bills upon a ſhort Sight.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, it was always my Opinion, That all <hi>private Emiſſions, deſigned as a common Currency, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Patent from the Prerogative, are irregular and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal</hi>: A private Perſon who ſtrikes a <hi>Crown</hi> Piece, tho' equal, or better, in Weight and Fineneſs, than a <hi>royal Crown Piece</hi>; is equally, in the Eye of our Laws, tho' not in itſelf, culpable, as a Perſon who ſtrikes a braſs Crown ſilvered.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> The <hi>Land-Bank,</hi> or Manufactory Scheme, (the deſigned Subject of this Letter) being a late Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of a vaſt Multitude of neceſſitous, idle, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant Perſons; with all the Signs of a genuine Bubble; contriv'd to have what they call Money, at an eaſy Rate; and to pay their Debts in a precarious falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Kind of Bills, very ill, or not at all, ſecured; of no determined Value; bearing no Intereſt; not payable (the Poſſeſſor cannot oblige to an Acceptance) until after twenty Years, and being a very large Sum (equal to all the then provincial Bills of <hi>New-England</hi>) of <hi>Six hundred thouſand Pounds,</hi> will, if not remedied, depreci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate all Paper Currencies, that are not determined by a Silver Value, conſequently prove a great Prejudice to private Property in the Province, and great Loſs and Damage to the Merchants of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> trading to <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:004738_0006_100D87DC11213930"/>Your Surmiſe is groundleſs, That perhaps ſome of our Merchants, who have ſuffered much by deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting publick Bills, have, <hi>jeſuitically,</hi> and as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the Curtain, <hi>prompted</hi> the unthinking Multitude, to a <hi>Scheme,</hi> running into unheard of Extremities of Sum, and Period; and at this critical Time, when all Paper Money is under the <hi>Cenſure</hi> of the <hi>Boards</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> on purpoſe to bring the <hi>Parliament</hi> under the Neceſſity of ſpeedily and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuppreſſing Paper Money of all Kinds.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Riſe</hi> of this <hi>Scheme,</hi> was from a few evil-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men, contrived only for their own Benefit, and have admitted a great Multitude of Subſcribers, by their Numbers to give it a Circulation, and to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute towards indemnifying them againſt all Acts of Government. Its being <hi>contrived only for the Benefit of the Directors,</hi> appears by their Conſtitution.</p>

The <hi>Bank</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> and all other well conſtituted Banks, are reſtricted from trading, that their Stock may remain good at home, ready to anſwer all Demands. Their ludicrous Pretence is, That ſince the Merchants will not ſell them Goods for this worthleſs Money, they will import all ſorts of Merchandiſe, for the Benefit of the

            </p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> They <hi>alter</hi> the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Partnerſhip</hi> at Pleaſure, without Conſent of a general Meeting, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending (contrary to all good Regulation) that private Conſent of the Members, without Deliberation or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, is ſufficient; this is the Reaſon of their Scheme being ſo often <hi>botched</hi>: Their Scheme now ſent to you, is their laſt, as it ſtands in the County Regiſter; it was refuſed a Record in the Secretary's Office: How ſoon it may be alter'd, we know not.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> The <hi>County Regiſters</hi> being lately ſearch'd by Order of the Governour and Council, to find out the civil and military Officers, g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

The Truth is ſhortly this; The Debtor part of the Country (which is vaſtly the moſt numerous) are contriving to baulk their Creditors by reducing the Denominations of Money (by their huge and ill-ſecured Emiſſions) to a ſmall or no Value; that they who have laudably acquired Fortunes by Induſtry and Frugality, may reap no Benefit thereof, but be upon a level with the Idle and Extravagant: We all have learnt by Experience that large Emiſſions with diſtant Periods, have ſunk a great Part of Debts, without any Conſideration.</p>
            <p>The Projectors gave to this <hi>Bubble</hi> the ſpecious Name of, <hi>A Bank</hi>:— It has not the leaſt Affinity to Banking. <hi>Banking</hi> is iſſuing of Caſh-Notes, payable upon Demand: or Merchants having lodged their Caſh, the <hi>Bank tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers</hi> Caſh from one Merchant's Folio, to that of another, when required.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt This Sham-Bank has <hi>no Stock</hi> in their Treaſury; and the Face of their Bills promiſing to accept them for Stock in the Treaſury is an <hi>arrant Bubble</hi>: It is true, that for ſome ſhort Time the Directors decoyed ſome <hi>Graziers and Hog-Drivers,</hi> to part with their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions for this their Land-Bank Money, but have ſhip'd it off in Trade for the Profit of the <hi>D</hi>—, and perhaps to help to indemnify themſelves when obliged to make good the Bills by them ſigned.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, Theſe Bills, tho' carrying no Intereſt, cannot make an effectual Demand of <hi>Acceptance till after Twenty Years,</hi> and then not payable in current Caſh, but in Goods of an <hi>Arbitrary</hi> Aſſortment and Value.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:004738_0009_100DD12E0DBCEFF0"/>3dly, As Produce and Manufacture are more valuable than depretiating Bills; all Payments of the Partnerſhip of Intereſt, and Parts of Principal, will be in theſe Bills; and conſequently no Produce, or Manufacture, will be found in their Treaſury.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, Being no Body-Corporate, they are under no Limitation: The Directors, who are for this very Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Signers, may and will emit Bills in <hi>indefinitum,</hi> or until at length their Value become near equal to the Charge of manufacturing them.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly, If we can ſuppoſe their <hi>Board of Bill-Makers</hi> to be honeſt-Men, and that in Conſcience (they having no other Check but Conſcience) they emit no more than according to their firſt Articles, as they have no <hi>excluſive Patent,</hi> any other Number of deſperate Men may fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the ſame Money-making Trade, and Bills may multiply as in the former Caſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly, In other Countries, the Opulent, the Honeſt, the Men of Credit, become Bankers; here the <hi>Indigent,</hi> the <hi>Debtors,</hi> the <hi>Frauduleut,</hi> ſet up for <hi>Bankers</hi>: A Bank of a Numerous, but <hi>poor</hi> People, who pretend to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate <hi>l.</hi> 600,000 without any Stock.</p>
            <p n="7">7thly, To compleat the Farce, the <hi>Securities</hi> for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating and paying off theſe Bills, are within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and may be <hi>ſtifled at Pleaſure.</hi>

               <hi>This Scheme</hi> is founded upon a Projection, diſapproved of by the <hi>General Aſſembly</hi> A. D. 1714; but is <hi>more Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitous</hi>; That of A.

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:004738_0010_100DD13085FDDFE0"/>The Projectors and Managers of this Scheme have <hi>Debauched</hi> the Minds of the People, by Inſtilling unto them ſome pernicious Principles, deſtructive of all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and good Government;</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> That <hi>common Conſent,</hi> or the Humour of the Multitude, ought to be the <hi>Ratio Ultima</hi> in every Thing and particularly in <hi>Currencies</hi>; whereas not only accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Conſtitution of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> but of all po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite Governments, Money or Currencies are the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative</hi> of the the SOVEREIGNS, and have followed the univerſal Cuſtom of Merchants, whereby <hi>Silver</hi> from its own natural Qualifications, could not avoid becoming the <hi>univerſal Medium of Trade.</hi> If we may ſuppoſe a Country entirely ſeparated from the trading Part of the World, common Conſent may admit of any Thing for a Currency, according to the Humour, or Profit of the Projectors; but this will fluctuate from one thing to another, until at length the moſt proper Material obtain a permanent Conſent: It is doubtleſs a <hi>high Miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> to aſſert ſtrenouſly, the Priviledge of the People, to emit and paſs any Thing as a Currency, in defiance, of the KING's <hi>Prerogative</hi> of <hi>Currencys.— Middleton,</hi> a neighbouring Town, has lately unanimouſly voted, that <hi>This Bank-Money</hi> ſhall be received as Caſh for Town-Rates.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> That every <hi>Landed Man,</hi> even to the mortgaging of his laſt Acre, has a <hi>Right</hi> to make <hi>Money</hi>: This is a moſt deſtructive and wicked Principle, the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity and Bulwark of a Country, are theſe People who have valuable Poſſeſſions and Effects to looſe; whereas they who are much in Debt, become deſperate, and bad Subjects, and have nothing to hinder them from relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhing their Country to the firſt Invader.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That the <hi>induſtrious Merchants,</hi> and frugal monied Men, are the Bane of a Country; becauſe they expect their Debts and Dues to be honeſtly paid: Whereas a Country without Trade is of little Value,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004738_0011_100DD1331B705290"/>
and would ſoon return to its primitive Waſte. People of Genius for Trade grow rich by the Labour of Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, and the Peaſants or Labourers happy by being employed: This Province noted for Trade, would ſoon become a Habitation of <hi>rude Ruſticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> To <hi>value themſelves as being formidable</hi> by their Numbers, Two Thouſand Principals, as they pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, and many Thouſand Abettors: This is <hi>Ruffian</hi> like, by Superiority of Numbers, to endeavour to make ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt People <hi>buy the Rabbit.</hi> Such dangerous bare-fac'd Combinations, are not to be conniv'd at in Government; they openly threaten, that in the next Aſſembly, no Body ſhall be a <hi>Repreſentative,</hi> or of the <hi>Council,</hi> but thoſe who are Principals or Abettors in this Scheme; and thus have formed an <hi>Imperium in imperio.</hi> If this Wickedneſs of Combinations, under the Name of Banking, ſhould ſpread into our neighbouring <hi>Charter Governments</hi> (in <hi>Providence</hi> of <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> they have gone ſome Lengths in it) where all the Negatives, or Branches of the Legiſlature are elective by the People; they would become Maſters in all Affairs of Legiſlature and Government; their Dependance upon and Subjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> would ſoon vaniſh. At this Time, in Neglect or Contempt of the Reſolves of <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> and ſubſequent <hi>King's</hi> Inſtructions, <hi>Connecticut</hi> have emitted <hi>One hundred and eight thouſand Pounds,</hi> and <hi>Rhode Iſland, Eighty thouſand Pounds,</hi> Province Bills.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly,</hi> By the incloſed News-Papers, printed in <hi>Boſton,</hi> you may ſee, and we here upon the Spott do daily hear, how the <hi>Managers</hi> ſpirit the People to <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny, Sedition,</hi> and <hi>Riots</hi>: One gives it for Law, That no <hi>Orders</hi> from the Boards at <hi>Whitehall,</hi> nor Acts of <hi>Parliament,</hi> can put a Stop to their Proceedings; Others ſay, We ſhall <hi>humble</hi> the proud Merchants; That if the Merchants will not receive theſe Bills in Pay, they muſt blame themſelves for any <hi>Outrages</hi> that may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004738_0012_100DD13506BE49B0"/>
That We had as good periſh by the Sword as by Famine, that is, by being <hi>Dragoon'd,</hi> as by Want of Money; That upon a <hi>French Invaſion,</hi> if we ſubmit, We cannot be worſe than at preſent; that is poor and in Debt; becauſe the Government or private Combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations will not let us have Paper Money, to the Ruin of the good People of the Province.</p>
            <p>You deſire to know what has been done by the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Province towards their Suppreſſion</hi>: One of the Negatives, I mean the Houſe of <hi>Repreſentatives, ſtand out</hi>; ſo that the Legiſlature can do nothing. The <hi>Governour</hi> and <hi>Council</hi> have acted with much Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Fortitude; and are diſmiſſing all Officers, Civil and Military, of their Appointment, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this Combination; only the <hi>Chairman</hi> of the Directors, and the <hi>Indorſer,</hi> their Commiſſions or War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants being from <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> cannot be diſmiſs'd; but their Diſmiſſions, by their Conſtituents at home, may be expected.</p>
            <p>You take the Liberty to ſurmiſe, a Liberty which you would not allow to me;</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> That for the preſent, the moſt ſummary Way of proceeding againſt this Combination, would be, To ſend for the <hi>Treaſurer, Directors,</hi> and <hi>Indorſer,</hi> to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> by a <hi>Meſſenger,</hi> with a Secretary of State's War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, to bring them upon Examination, concerning this high Crime and Miſdemeanour: But this would ruin them in their ſmall Fortunes, and render them leſs capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſatisfy the Poſſeſſors of the Bills, when returned upon them.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> That the <hi>Mortgages</hi> of <hi>Lands</hi> in the Partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip <hi>cannot be ſued out</hi> by the Managers; becauſe there was no valuable Conſideration received. Thus the Poſſeſſors having only the Eſtates of the Signers liable, would not receive above <hi>Two Shillings</hi> in the Pound.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:004738_0013_100DD137AF2F9ED0"/>3<hi>dly,</hi> That the Poſſeſſors having had ſufficient War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring from the Government, can claim none of their <hi>Compaſſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We hope that the Government, who are the Parents and Guardians of the People, will act, as natural Parents do with their Children, guilty of ſome Follies, after repeated Admonition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In all Bubbles, Combinations,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Guilt of the Projectors and Managers is from a corrupt Principle; but the Error in their Followers, the Multitude, is only from a Miſtake in Judgment.</hi>
