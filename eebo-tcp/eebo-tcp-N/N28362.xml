            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>A CONTROVERSY between you and Mr. Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers the Epiſcopal Miniſter of Ballſton, having late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fallen into my hands, wherein you are pleaſed to treat the Epiſcopalians of theſe States in a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlemanly manner. I ſhall at preſent only advert to your aſſertions, that no man can aſcertain the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe day of the Nativity of our Lord, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that Epiſcopalians are ſuperſtitious and abſurd in their obſervance of the 25th of December, as the anniverſary of Chriſtmas. Hereafter, I ſhall do my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the pleaſure of addreſſing you on the other obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances and doctrius ſacred to Epiſcopalians, with which you have taken, in my judgment, very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable freedoms.</p>
            <p>To a man ſo converſant with the ſacred Scripture, and ſo repleniſhed with the plenitude of the Holy Spirit, as you profeſs to be, the circumſtance of St. Luke's beginning his Goſpel with a chronological ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of an event immediately connected with our Saviour's Incarnation, and a virtual repetition of the ſame thing by the Holy Angel as the time of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuciation, can hardly be ſuppoſed matters of indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: And yet it is evident that you have either o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlooked or miſtaken the meaning of both; for you ſay it is a matter of indifference whether the day can be aſcertained or not: The which I deny, and think it a matter of great conſequence to Chriſtianity that the day of our Lord's Nativity ſhould be chronologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally aſcertained. I will therefore, preſent you, and
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:037794_0003_100F52649E74CC78"/>the candid public, a calculation of the preciſe day of the Nativity founded upon two data, viz. the Old and New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>I. Chron. ch. 24, v. 7 to v. 20,—we find the twenty-four Courſes of the Jewiſh Prieſts eſtabliſhed by David, who was "a Prophet and a man after God's own heart," and knew perfectly what he was about when he made this eſtabliſhment. Of theſe 24 Courſes, the 8th at the inſtitution, fell by lot to Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah or Abias, to which courſe Zacharias the Father of the Baptiſt belonged. One courſe attended upon the Service of the Temple, eight days, from ſabbath to ſabbath. The miniſtry of each courſe began at the morning ſervice of the firſt, and ended at the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſervice of the next ſabbath; the High Prieſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into the Temple with the courſe which ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, bleſſed and diſmiſſed the courſe, which had fulfilled their miniſtrations, the Prieſts of which then departed to their own city. And both theſe facts are authenticated both by Joſephus, and the Jewiſh Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urgy. The Jewiſh hiſtorian (book 6) ſays, "The High Prieſt went into the Temple with the other Prieſts, not every day, but only every ſabbath day, the calends of every month, and the annaverſary Feaſts." And in the Jewiſh Liturgy we read, "On the Sabbath the High Prieſt added one benediction upon that courſe, which then went out of their min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtration."</p>
            <p>Therefore, as the miniſtry of one courſe is 7 com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete days, and the number of courſes 24:—the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete cycle or period of time, wherein the 24 courſes return to the ſame <hi>day and hour</hi> wherein they firſt mininſtered is 224 years. But as the above cycle is ſomewhat unwieldy for calculation, a ſmaller cycle becomes neceſſary, and there is one of 50 revolutions concluding at the end of 23 years after their firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, or any revolution of the great cycle of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>24 years, with an overplus of 18 hours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:037794_0004_100F2797DF755458"/>
From the dedication of the ſecond Temple, in the 6th year of Darius Nothus, on the 3d day of the Heb. month Adas, that is on the 19th of February, to the deſtruction thereof, (according to Euſebius' Chron. of Daniel's 70 weeks, chap. 9) are exactly 490 years.</p>
            <p>From our Saviour's birth to the deſtruction of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and juſt 71 years, (according to Scaliger and others) and from the 15th of Tiberus to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Jeruſalem by Titus Veſpaſian are 40 years.</p>
            <p>From theſe data, the calculation of the time of Zacharias' miniſtration (which St. Luke mentions ſo particularly) may be calculated thus:</p>
            <p>In the 490 years that the Temple ſtood, there are two complete great ſacerdotal cycles ending with the year 448. There remains till the fall of the Temple 42 years: which ſubtract from the year of our Lord 71, in which the Temple fell, and there remains 29, the year of Chriſt, when the ſecond great ſacerdotal cycle ended and the third began, out of which deduct the imperfect cycle of 50 revolutions, or 23 years, the remaining <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> denote the year of Chriſt, when the courſe began preciſely on the ſame day on which they originally commenced, with an orverplus of 18 hours.</p>
            <p>Therefore in theſe 6 years previous to the Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our Lord, the ſacerdotal courſes ſtand thus, viz.
<list>
                  <item>In the 6th year, the 1ſt courſe, that of Jehoiarib began, Feb. 19</item>
                  <item>In the 5th year, the firſt, &amp;c. Jan. 19</item>
                  <item>In the 4th year, the firſt, &amp;c. Dec. 19</item>
                  <item>In the 3d year, the firſt, &amp;c. Nov. 19</item>
                  <item>In the 2d year, the firſt, &amp;c. Oct. 19</item>
                  <item>In the 1ſt year, the firſt, &amp;c. Sept. 19</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, the firſt courſe in the year of Chriſt's Conception began on the 19th of Auguſt; from whence, if we reckon to the 8th week, we come to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037794_0005_100F52670513BE60"/>the 8th courſe, the courſe of Abijah, or Abias which commences on the 7th of October, and ends on the 14th of the ſame month. On the 14th of October Zacharias having fulfilled his week's miniſtry, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home on the 15th, when his wife conceived preciſely 5 months and 3 days, before the Annuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Now from the 15th of Oct. to the Annunciation March 25th are <hi>5m. 3w. 1d.</hi>—and juſt ſo long was Elizabeth advanced in her pregnancy at the time of the Angel's Salutation to the Virgin Mother—<hi>"This is the ſixth month with her who was called barren."</hi> This circumſtance is hinted at afterwards by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangiliſt, when he ſays,—(ch. 1. v. 56.) <hi>"Mary abode with her about three months,"</hi> that is, until the 24th of June, the day which the Church celebrates as the Nativity of the Baptiſt.</p>
            <p>If then the Baptiſt was conceived on the 15th of October, and was advanced five months, three weeks and one day, at the time of the Conception of our Lord, that is the 25th of March, the day celebrated by the Church, in commemoration of ſo ſignal a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; it follows, that the 25th of December is the true day of the Nativity <hi>of the Son of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hence it is evident, that the time of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of our Lord hath been fairly tranſmitted down to us, by our forefathers, and that the Chriſtian Church is a faithful guardain, of ſo ineſtimable a piece of chronology. God ſaw proper to conceal the burial place of the body of Moſes, leſt it ſhould in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture times become an object of adoration;—but on the body of Chriſt he beſtowed ſuch honor, that all the Angels of God, and the ſons of men worſhip it;— and as the Law and the Prophets, with the divine Shekina pointed to the Birth-place of the Son of God; ſo the courſes of the Prieſts offered an infallible cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation to point out the preciſe time, when the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037794_0006_100F5279CE22AAE8"/>Word became incarnate, and took delight to be with the ſons of men.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>ON the 9th of February laſt, I received a letter from a Mr. HUBBARD, of New-Haven, in which were incloſed two copies of a printed letter addreſſed by you to me. In this letter you inform me, that you have ſeen the controverſy which tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired laſt winter, between Mr. Rogers, the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal miniſter of this town &amp; myſelf, upon the ſubject of Chriſtmas; and in which alſo, you have attempted a flual deciſion of it. I confeſs that I was ſomewhat ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at firſt, for as Mr. Rogers had repreſented me in a very mean and contemptable light; and alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that he had effectually anſwered my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I never expected that any Epiſcopal Miniſter would take ſo much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of me again, as to write againſt me upon that or any other ſubject; nor was I under any great concern about it. But this attempt of yours, leads me to conclude, that you conſider it as a matter of great conſequence to your cauſe, and the only means to avoid the charge of ſuperſtition, to render it certain that Jeſus Chriſt was born upon the 25th day of December; it ſeems alſo, that you are of opinion, that your friend Rogers, with all his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces is quite inadequate to this important taſk. Indeed, it has furniſhed me with one concluſion more, &amp; that
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037794_0007_100F526A1672B058"/>is, that you are ſenſible of ſo much weight in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, and teſtimonies, which I produced from ſcripture and hiſtory, that unleſs you introduced this ſavourite point to the public in ſome new method; or by a circumlocution of calculation, could bring it round at a diſtance from thoſe objections, it would be of no avail to undertake to ſupport it. But as it is, whether you have ſpent your ſtrength for naught, and your labour for that which fatisfieth not, the public will judge from what follows.</p>
            <p>The ſole queſtion, to be decided between us at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is, whether there be any certainty, that the birth of Chriſt happened upon the 25th of December. You ſay there is, and have given your reaſons for it. I ſay, that notwithſtanding all you have ſaid, there is not; and ſhall now proceed to give the reaſons which I have for my aſſertion.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing I ſhall remark in your letter, is your aſſerting that I ſaid, it was a matter of indffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence whether the day can be aſcertained or not. But ſir, you ſhould look ſharper, and read with more at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; for though ſuch a concluſion might be drawn from the nature of my reaſoning, yet the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation was made by Mr. Rogers himſelf, and I have only made my remarks upon it. What you have ſaid concerning the courſes of the Jewiſh Prieſts will anſwer you no purpoſe, unleſs you can prove that they kept an exact pace in their ſervice, with the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of time in your calculation; for the argument does not depend upon the time, as being regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by their ſervice, but upon their ſervice, as being regulated by the time; one interruption there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, would throw your whole ſyſtem into confuſion, and wholly diſappoint you of finding Zacharias in the temple at the expected time. And that there have been ſeveral interruptions, is certain; for when the ark was inducted into the sacred oracle, and the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple dedicated by Solomon, the prieſts officiated alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037794_0008_100F527B53AFD738"/>and did not wait by courſe. Something sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilar, happened alſo in the days of king Hezekiah; and even ſome who have attempted to prove by their courſes, that Chriſt was born in September, have failed to give ſatisfaction, becauſe it could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to a certainty, what number of years paſſed between the reſtoration of the temple worſhip, by Judas Maccabeus, and the time that Zacharias was ſtruck dumb; neither with what courſe of prieſts Judas began the reſtoration.</p>
            <p>But after giving a ſtatement of theſe courſes, it ſeems your whole dependence for the uſe of them, in this controverſy, is reſted upon Euſebius' calculation of the 70 weeks of Daniel; ſhould there however be an uncertainty here alſo, your theory will appear in a worſe ſituation than before. And now ſir, I might launch into an almoſt boundleſs abyſs of calculation, but I have no inclination to venture out, nor is my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle bark, by any means ſufficient to paſs the unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled ocean of cronological difficulties; and even you, with all your ſkill and learning, will in my opinion, ſoon appear to have run faſt aground upon the ſhoals of conjecture, while you imagine, that you have ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arrived at that cardinal point in the Chriſtian aera, the certain day of our Saviour's nativity. If you are a gentleman of much reading, you cannot be ignorant, that ſome writers have made of theſe weeks 70 years; ſo that the whole would amount to 4000 and 900 years. Some Rabbins make of them 49 years, reckoning from one jubilee to another; ſo that they would conſiſt of 3000, 400 and 30 years. Others make an hundred years of them, which would bring the whole up to 7000 years. Moſt interpreters however, conſider them as weeks of years, which makes exactly 490 years; but even thoſe who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the prediction marks out the time of the birth &amp; paſſion of our Saviour, are exceedingly divided, as to the certain time of their beginning and ending. Some
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037794_0009_100F526C59BAF9A0"/>begin them from the 1ſt year of Cyrus, and end them at the deſtruction of the temple by the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans; but if the temple was deſtroyed in the year 70, or 71, as ſome ſay; then according to the bible chronology, which is as correct, and I believe the moſt adhered to of any, the term of time from the 1ſt year of Cyrus to that event, was 606, or 7 years. Others begin them from the 1ſt year of Darius the Mede, and end them at the birth of Chriſt, as near as they can come to it; but this makes an interim of 538 years. Others begin them at the 1ſt year of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, and conclude them at the prophanation of the temple by Antiochus Epiphanes, which makes a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod only of 370 years. I have not read Euſebius, but according to your account, he begins them at the dedication of the ſecond temple, and ends them with the deſtruction of it; but inſtead of 490 years, you will find the ſpace of time between theſe events, to be 585 or 6 years. Julius Africanus, begins them in the 2d year of Artaxerxes, and ends them at the death of Chriſt, which he thinks happened in the 15th year of Tiberius. This calculation comes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in two or three years of it, and as a learned anon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ymous writer obſerves, is the moſt rational ſyſtem of any propoſed by the ancients, and to which a few things excepted, the greateſt part of interpreters, and Chronologers agree. I confeſs however, that I differ a little from it; it being plain, that both the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and end of this period, is hinted at in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy—Know therefore, and underſtand, that from the going forth of the comandment, to reſtore, and to build Jeruſalem &amp;c. This appers to be the ſubſtance in part, of what is couched in the foregoing verſe; and taking the ſenſe of the whole verſe complete, it finiſhes the period at the death of Chriſt; for the finiſhing of tranſgreſſion, making an end of fins, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king reconciliation for iniquity, bringing in everlaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting righteouſneſs, ſealing up the viſion and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037794_0010_100F527D96649310"/>and anointing the moſt holy, ſounds to me ſo much like the declaration of the dying Saviour on the croſs—it is finiſhed—that I can hardly believe it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to any thing elſe. Almoſt all interpreters agree that Chriſt died between the age of 30, and 34 years; ſo that if we ſuppoſe the commandment, refers to the decrees given out in the 7th year of Artaxerxes Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimanus, as recorded in the 7th chap. of Ezra, which was in the year before Chriſt 457, and then add 33 years for the life of Chriſt, it makes out the 490 years exactly. There are however ſo many difficulties attending theſe different hypotheſis, that it would be folly to the laſt degree, to pretend to find an abſolute certainty in any of them; much leſs in that of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſebius, which is as deſtitute of probability, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps as little attended to as any one of the whole, &amp; is therefore, but a poor foundation for you to truſt to in this caſe.</p>
            <p>But Sir, ſuppoſing you was quite ſafe hitherto, yet what follows would completely unhinge your conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſet all afloat at once. You ſay that Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth conceived on the 15th of October, preciſely 5 months, and 3 days before the annunciation; but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this, the annunciation muſt happen on the 18th of March. You then proceed to obſerve, that from the 15th of October to the annunciation, March 25th, are 5 months, 3 weeks, and one day; and juſt ſo long was Elizabeth advanced in her preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy, at the time of the angels ſalutation to the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin mother—but by what rule you have made this out, I cannot tell, unleſs you have ſplit ſome of the days and made two of them, for I cannot find from the 15th of October to the 25th of March, but 5 months, 1 week, and 3 days. I thought this at firſt to have been a typographical error; but finding it a little after repeated at full length, I began to ſearch after the myſtery, and ſoon found, that from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Chriſt to his birth, you had allowed juſt
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037794_0011_100F526E9E89D730"/>23 days more than you had allowed for John in the ſame caſe. And ſince you calculate from the concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to find the certain time of a birth; to make ſuch a difference between theſe two, muſt appear very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary indeed; it ſeems you were therefere ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that the 3 weeks and 1 day, muſt be thruſt in ſomewhere between the 15th of October, and the 24th of June. Your opinion however, that the 3 months, in which Mary tarried with Elizabeth extended from the 25th of March to the period laſt mentioned, left no room for them there; you have therefore, croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them between the 15th of October, and the annun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation; but as only ten days of them are there, I ſhall leave you to ſearch for the other 12 wherever you can find them.</p>
            <p>Now Sir, to make your calculation conſiſtent with the principle you ſet out upon, viz. of finding the time of a birth, by the conception; if we reckon by the month, from the 25th of March to the 25th of December, and from the 15th of Octo. to the 15th of July, are juſt 9 months each; but if we reckon by the day, there is a difference of 2 days; and as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry viſited Elizabeth about the time of the annuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and tarried with her 3 months, until John was born, or to the 15th of July the annunciation muſt have happened about the 15th of April, and Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas muſt come about the middle of January. But if you ſuppoſe that John was born on the 24th of June, then you muſt either inſiſt upon it, that John was born 23 days ſooner, after he was conceived, than Chriſt was, which will evidently deſtroy the principle above referred to; or frankly admit that Elizabeth conceived on the 24th of September, which will effectually operate againſt the order of your cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, ſo that turn which way you will, your whole ſyſtem is unhinged, and muſt inevitably fall to the ground. And again, if Elizabeth conceived on the 15th of Octo. and was advanced 5 months, 3
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037794_0012_100F5280DDD5C1A0"/>weeks and a day, at the time of the annunciation, as you affirm; then the annunciation muſt happen upon the 6th day of April, and Chriſtmas would come of courſe upon the 6th of January, the preciſe day on which moſt of the Greek Fathers after the 4th centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, thought the Saviour was born.</p>
            <p>But dear Sir, where now is the infalliable calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you ſpeak of, which renders it ſo certain, that the 25th of December is the true Chriſtmas? For my part, I think it evident, that as God ſaw fit to conceal the Sepulchre of Moſes, leſt it ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards become an object of adoration; ſo he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videntially obſcured the day of Chriſt's nativity, leſt it ſhould be more reverenced by the ſons of men, than Chriſt himſelf;—but notwithſtanding all this, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition has prevailed, a day has been appointed at un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty, and religious devotion paid to it, in ſuch a manner, as in my opinion, highly derogates from the honor of the ever Adorable Redeemer. It is however improbable to me, that this will have any ſalutary effect upon your mind; I muſt therefore ſay to you, as Paul ſaid to the Galatians of old, "ye ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve days, and months, and times, and years; I am afraid of you, leſt I have beſtowed upon you labour in vain." I was thinking to make a few more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, but I finally conclude to lay up my pen, till I hear ſomething from you, upon the other obſervanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and doctrines ſacred to Epiſcopalians.</p>
