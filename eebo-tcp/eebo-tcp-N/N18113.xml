            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>DEDICATION TO THE Engliſh Nation.</head>
            <p>I DEDICATE to YOU a Collection of Letters, written by one of YOURSELVES for the common benefit of us all. They would never have grown to this ſize without your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued encouragement and applauſe. To me they orginally owe nothing but a healthy, ſanguine conſtitution. Under YOUR care they have thriven. To YOU they are indebted for whatever ſtrength or beauty they poſſeſs. When Kings and Miniſters are forgotten; when the force and direction of perſonal ſatire is no longer underſtood; and when meaſures are only felt in their remoteſt conſequences, this book will, I believe, be found to contain principles worthy to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to poſterity. When YOU leave the unimpaired here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary freehold to YOUR children, YOU do but half YOUR duty. Both liberty and property are precarious, unleſs the poſſeſſors have ſenſe and ſpirit enough to defend them.—This is not the language of vanity. If I am a vain man, my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification lies within a narrow circle. I am the ſole depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary of my own ſecret, and it ſhall periſh with me.</p>
            <p>If an honeſt, and, I may truly affirm, a laborious zeal for the public ſervice, has given me any weight in YOUR eſteem, let me exhort and conjure YOU never to ſuffer an invaſion of YOUR political conſtitution, however minute the inſtance may appear, to paſs by, without a determined, perſevering reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. One precedent creates another.—They ſoon accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and conſtitute law. What yeſterday was fact, to-day is doctrine. Examples are ſuppoſed to juſtify the moſt danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous meaſures; and where they do not ſuit exactly, the defect is ſupplied by analogy.—Be aſſured that the laws, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect us in our civil rights, grow out of the conſtitution, and that they muſt fall or flouriſh with it. This is not the cauſe of faction or a party, or of any individual, but the common intereſt of every man in Britian. Although the King ſhould
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:023477_0005_0FBFB44C04F67E18"/>continue to ſupport his preſent ſyſtem of government, the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod is not very diſtant, at which you will have the means of redreſs in your own power. It may be nearer perhaps than any of us expect, and I would warn YOU to be prepared for it. The King may poſſibly be adviſed to diſſolve the preſent parliament a year or two before it expires of courſe, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate a new election, in hopes of taking the nation by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe. If ſuch a meaſure be in agitation, this very caution may defeat or prevent it.</p>
            <p>I cannot doubt that YOU will unanimouſly aſſert the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of election, and vindicate your excluſive right to chooſe your repreſentatives. But other queſtions have been ſtarted, on which your determination ſhould be equally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and unanimous. Let it be impreſſed upon your minds, let it be inſtilled into your children, that the liberty of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Under a particular propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they have aſſerted a general truth, in which every man in England is concerned.</note>. They are the truſtees, not the owners, of the eſtate—The fee-ſimple is in US. They cannot alienate, they cannot waſte. When we ſay that the legiſlature is <hi>ſupreme,</hi> we mean, that it is the higheſt power known to the conſtitution;—that it is the higheſt in compariſon with the other ſubordinate powers eſtabliſhed by the laws. In this ſenſe, the word <hi>ſupreme</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, not abſolute. The power of the legiſlature is limited, not only by the general rules of natural juſtice, and the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:023477_0006_0FBFB450223B88D8"/>of the community, but by the forms and principles of our particular conſtitution. If this doctrine be not true, we muſt admit, that King, Lords, and Commons, have no rule to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their reſolutions, but merely their own will and pleaſure. They might unite the legiſlative and executive power in the ſame hands, and diſſolve the conſtitution by an act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But I am perſuaded YOU will not leave it to the choice of ſeven hundred perſons, notoriouſly corrupted by the crown, whether ſeven millions of their equals ſhall be freemen or ſlaves. The certainty of forfeiting their own rights, when they ſacrifice thoſe of the nation, is no check to a brutal, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate mind. Without inſiſting upon the extravagant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion made to Harry the Eighth, there are inſtances, in the hiſtory of other countries, of a formal, deliberate ſurrender of the public liberty into the hands of the ſovereign. If England does not ſhare the ſame fate, it is becauſe we have better reſources than in the virtue of either houſe of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>I ſaid that the liberty of the preſs is the <hi>palladium</hi> of all your rights, and that the right of the juries to return a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral verdict is part of your conſtitution. To preſerve the whole ſyſtem, YOU muſt correct your legiſlature. With regard to any influence of the conſtituent over the conduct of the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, there is little difference between a ſeat in parliament for ſeven years and a ſeat for life. The proſpect of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment is too remote; and although the laſt ſeſſion of a ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tennial parliament be uſually employed in courting the favour of the people, conſider, that at this rate your repreſentatives have ſix years for offence, and but one for atonement. A death-bed repentance ſeldom reaches to reſtitution. If you reflect that in the changes of adminiſtration which have marked and diſgraced the preſent reign, although your warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt patriots have in their torn been inveſted with the lawful and unlawful authority of the crown, and though other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefs or improvements have been held forth to the people, yet that no one man in office has ever promoted or encouraged a bill for ſhortening the duration of parliaments, but that (who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever was miniſter) the oppoſition to this meaſure, ever ſince the ſeptennial act paſſed, has been conſtant and uniform on the part of government.—You cannot bet conclude, without the poſſibility of a doubt, that long parliaments are the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the undue influence of the crown. This influence
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:023477_0007_0FBFB451600A06C0"/>anſwers every purpoſe of arbitrary power to the crown, with an expence and oppreſſion to the people, which would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary in an arbitrary government. The beſt of our mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters find it the eaſieſt and moſt compendious mode of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting the King's affairs; and all miniſters have a general intereſt in adhering to a ſyſtem, which of itſelf is ſufficient to ſupport them in office, without any aſſiſtance from perſonal virtue, popularity, labour, abilities, or experience. It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes every gratification to avarice and ambition, and ſecures impunity.—Theſe are truths unqueſtionable.—If they make no impreſſion, it is becauſe they are too vulgar and notorious. But the inattention or indifference of the nation has continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too long.

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE encouragement given to a multitude of ſpurious, mangled publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Letters of <hi>Junius,</hi> perſuades me, that a complete edition, corrected and improved by the Author, will be favourably received. The Printer will readily acquit me of any view to my own profit. I undertake this troubleſome t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>k, merely to ſerve a man who has deſerved well of me, and of the public and who, on my account, has been expoſed to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive, tyrannical proſecution. For theſe reaſons, I give to <hi>Mr. Henry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and to him alone, my right, intereſt, and property in there Letters, as fully and completely, to all intents and purpoſes, as an author can poſſibly convey his property in his own works to another.</p>
            <p>This edition contains all the letters of <hi>Junius, Philo-Junius,</hi> and of <hi>Sir William Draper</hi> and <hi>Mr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> to <hi>Junius,</hi> with their reſpective dates, and according to the order in which they appeared in the Public Advertiſer. The auxiliary part of <hi>Philo-Junius</hi> was indiſpenſably neceſſary to defend or explain particular paſſages in <hi>Junius,</hi> in anſwer to plauſible objections; but the ſubordinate character is never guilty of the indecorum of praiſing his principal. The fraud was innocent, and I always intended to explain it. The notes will be found not only uſeful, but neceſſary. References in facts not generally known, or alluſions to the current report or opinion of the day, are in a little time unintelligible. Yet the Reader will not find himſelf overloaded with explanations. I was not born to be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator, even upon my own works.</p>
            <p>It remains to ſay a few words upon the liberty of the preſs. The daring ſpirit by which theſe letters are ſuppoſed to be diſtinguiſhed, ſeems to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that ſomething ſerious ſhould be ſaid in their defence. I am no law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer by profeſſion, nor do I pretend to be more deeply read than every Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh gentleman ſhould be in the laws of his country. If, therefore, the principles I maintain are truly conſtitutional, I ſhall not think myſelf an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, though I ſhould be convicted of a miſtake in terms, or of miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the language of the law. I ſpeak to the plain underſtanding of the people, and appeal to their honeſt, liberal conſtruction of me.</p>
            <p>Good men, to whom alone I address myſelf, appear to me to conſult their piety as little as their judgment and experience, when they admit the great and eſſential advantages accruing to ſociety from the freedom of the preſs, yet in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>erge themſelves in peeviſh or paſſionate exclamations againſt the abuſes of it. Betraying an unreaſonable expectation of benefits pure and entire from any human inſtitution, they in effect arraign the goodneſs of Providence, and confeſs that they are diſſatisfied with the common lot of humanity. In the preſent inſtance, they really create to their own minds, or greatly exaggerate, the evil they complain of. The laws of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land provide as effectually as any human laws can do, for the protection of the ſubject, in his reputation, as well as in his perſon and property. If
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:023477_0009_0FBFB45AB88F2BF8"/>the characters of private men are inſulted or injured, a double remedy is open to them, by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

If, from an unwarrantable diſtruſt of the integrity of juries, they would wiſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain juſtice by any mode of proceeding more ſummary than a trial by their peers. I do not ſcruple to affirm, that they are in effect greater enemies to themſelves than to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

            <p>With regard to ſtrictures upon the characters of men in office, and the meaſures of government, the caſe is a little different. A conſiderable lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude muſt be allowed in the diſcuſſion of public affairs, or the liberty of the preſs will be of no benefit to ſociety. As the indulgence of private <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

            <p>It has alſo been alledged, that, although a common jury are ſufficient to determine a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  <date>JANUARY 21, 1769.</date>
               </opener>
               <p>THE ſubmiſſion of a free people to the executive authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of government, is no more than a compliance with laws which they themſelves have enacted. While the national honour is firmly maintained abroad, and while juſtice is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partially adminiſtered at home, the obedience of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject will be voluntary, cheerful, and I might almoſt ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited. A generous nation is grateful even for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of its rights, and willingly extends the reſpect due to the Office of a good prince into an affection for his Perſon. Loyalty, in the heart and underſtanding of an Engliſhman, is a rational attachment to the guardian of the laws. Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and paſſion have ſometimes carried it to a criminal length; and, whatever foreigners may imagine, we know that Engliſhmen have erred as much in a miſtaken zeal for particular perſons and families, as they ever did in defence of what they thought moſt dear and intereſting to themſelves.</p>
               <p>It naturally fills us with reſentment, to ſee ſuch a temper inſulted and abuſed. In reading the hiſtory of a free people, whoſe rights have been invaded, we are intereſted in their cauſe. Our own feelings tell us how they ought to have ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and at what moment it would have been treachery to themſelves not to have reſiſted. How much warmer will
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023477_0017_0FBFB47843C44390"/>be our reſentment, if experience ſhould bring the fatal exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple home to ourſelves!</p>
               <p>The ſituation of this country is alarming enough to rouſe the attention of every man who pretends to a concern for the public welfare. Appearances juſtify ſuſpicion; and when the ſafety of a nation is at ſtake, ſuſpicion is a juſt ground of inquiry. Let us enter into it with candour and decency. Reſpect is due to the ſtation of miniſters; and, if a reſolution muſt at laſt be taken, there is none ſo likely to be ſupported with firmneſs as that which has been adopted with mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>The ruin or proſperity of a ſtate depends ſo much upon the adminiſtration of its government, that, to be acquainted with the merit of a miniſtry, we need only obſerve the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the people. If we ſee them obedient to the laws, proſperous in their induſtry, united at home, and reſpected abroad, we may reaſonably preſume that their affairs are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by men of experience, abilities, and virtue. If, on the contrary, we ſee an univerſal ſpirit of diſtruſt and diſſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a rapid decay of trade, diſſenſions in all parts of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and a total loſs of reſpect in the eyes of foreign powers, we may pronounce without heſitation, that the government of that country is weak, diſtracted, and corrupt. The mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, in all countries, are patient to a certain point. Ill-uſage may rouſe their indignation, and hurry them into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes; but the original fault is in government. Parhaps there never was an inſtance of a change, in the circumſtances and temper of a whole nation, ſo ſudden and extraordinary as that which the miſconduct of miniſters has, within theſe few years, produced in Great Britain. When our gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign aſcended the throne, we were a flourſhing and a content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people. If the perſonal virtues of a king could have inſured the happineſs of his ſubjects, the ſcene could not have alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo entirely as it has done. The idea of uniting all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, of trying all characters, and diſtributing the offices of ſtate by rotation, was gracious and benevolent to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, though it has not yet produced the many ſalutary ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects which were intended by it. To ſay nothing of the wiſdom of ſuch a plan, it undoubtedly aroſe from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded goodneſs of heart, in which folly had no ſhare. It was not a capricious partiality to new faces;—it was not a natural turn for low intrigue;—nor was it the treacherous
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023477_0018_0FBFB47AF9988D78"/>amuſement of double and triple negociations. No, Sir; it aroſe from a continued anxiety, in the pureſt of all poſſible hearts, for the general welfare. Unfortunately for us, the event has not been anſwerable to the deſign. After a rapid ſucceſſion of changes, we are reduced to that ſtate, which hardly any change can mend. Yet there is no extremity of diſtreſs, which of itſelf ought to reduce a great nation to deſpair. It is not the diſorder but the phyſician;—it is not a caſual cencurrence of calamitous circumſtances;—it is the pernicious hand of government, which alone can make a whole people deſperate.</p>
               <p>Without much political ſagacity, or any extraordinary depth of obſervation, we need only mark how the principal departments of the ſtate are beſtowed, and look no farther for the true cauſe of every miſchief that befals us.</p>

As for buſineſs, the world yet knows nothing of his talents or reſolution: unleſs a way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, wavering inconſiſtency be a mark of genius, and caprice a demonſtration of ſpirit. It may be ſaid, perhaps, that it is his Grace's province, as ſurely it is his paſſion, rather to diſtribute than to ſave the public money; and the while Lord North is Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Firſt Lord of the Treaſury may be as thoughtleſs and extravagant as he pleaſes. I hope, however, he will not rely too much on the fertility of Lord North's genius for finance.

Lord Weymouth had diſtinguiſhed himſelf in his firſt employment by a ſpirited if not judicious conduct. He had animated the civil magiſtrate beyond the tone of civil authority, and had directed the operations of the army to more than military execution.

It was not the heat of midnight ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, nor ignorance of the laws, nor the furious ſpirit of the houſe of Bedford: No, Sir, when this reſpectable miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter interpoſed his authority between the magiſtrate and the people, and ſigned the mandate, on which for aught he knew, the lives of thouſands depended, he did it from the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023477_0022_0FBFB48B280EA768"/>deliberate motion of his heart ſupported by the beſt of his judgment.</p>
               <p>It has lately been a faſhion to pay a compliment to the bravery and generoſity of the commander in chief<note n="*" place="bottom">The late Lord Granby.</note> at the expence of his underſtanding. They who love him leaſt make no queſtion of his courage, while his friends dwell chiefly on the facility of his diſpoſition. Admitting him to be as brave as a total abſence of all feeling and reflection can make him, let us ſe what fort of merit he derives from the remainder of his character. If it be generoſity to accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate in his own perſon and family a number of lucrative employments; to provide, at the public expence, for every creature that bears the name of Manners; and, neglecting the merit and ſervices of the reſt of the army, to heap pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions upon his favourites and dependants; the preſent commander in chief is the moſt generous man alive. Nature has been ſparing of her gifts to this noble Lord; but where birth and fortune are united, we expect the noble pride and independence of a man of ſpirit, not the ſervile humiliating complaiſance of a courtier. As to the goodneſs of his heart, if a proof of it be taken from the facility of never refuſing, what concluſion ſhall we dray from the indecency of never performing? And if the diſcipline of the army be in any degree preſerved, what thanks are due to a man, whoſe cares, notoriouſly confined to filing up vacancies, have degraded the office of commander in chief into a broker of commiſſions?</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the navy. I ſhall only ſay, that this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is ſo highly indebted to Sir Edward Hawke, that no expence ſhould be ſpared to ſecure to him an honourable and affluent retreat.</p>
               <p>The pure and impartial adminiſtration of juſtice is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the firmeſt bond to ſecure a cheerful ſubmiſſion of the people, and to engage their affections to government. It is not ſufficient that queſtions of private right and wrong are juſtly decided, nor that judges are ſuperior to the vileneſs of pecuniary corruption. Jefferies himſelf, when the court had no intereſt, was an upright judge. A court of juſtice may be ſubject to another ſort of bias more important and pernicious, as it reaches beyond the intereſt of individuals, and affects the whole community. A judge, under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023477_0023_0FBFB48CA0AFFF08"/>of government, nor may be honeſt enough in the deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of private cauſes, yet a traitor to the public. When a victim is marked out by the miniſtry, this judge will off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Theſe principles, and proceedings, odious and contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible as they are, in effect are no leſs injudicious. A wiſe as generous people are rouſed by every appearance of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive, unconſtitutional meaſures, whether th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Prudence and ſelf-preſervation will oblige the moſt moderate diſpoſitions to make common cauſe, even with a man whoſe conduct they cenſure, if they ſee him perſecuted in a way which the real ſpirit of the laws will not juſtify. The facts, on which theſe remarks are founded, are too notorious to require an application.</p>

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:023477_0025_0FBFB4941FAB3550"/>traduced, without attempting his juſtification, as to be the author of the calumny againſt him. For my own part, I think it a ſort of miſpriſion of treaſon againſt ſociety. No man, therefore, who knows Lord Granby, can poſſible hear ſo good and great a character moſt vilely abuſed, without a warm and juſt indignation againſt this Junius, this high-prieſt of envy, malice, and all uncharitableneſs, who has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſacrifice our beloved commander in chief at the altars of his horrid deities. Nor is the injury may too ſoon feel the contempt, and conſequently the attacks of our late enemies, if they can be induced to believe that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, on whom the ſafety of theſe kingdoms ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, is unequal to his high ſtation, and deſtitute of thoſe qualities which form a good general. One would have thought that his Lordſhip's ſervices in the cauſe of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, from the battle of Culloden to his moſt glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the late war, might have entitled him to common reſpect and decency at leaſt: but this uncandid indecent writer has gone ſo far as to turn one of the moſt amiable men of the age into a ſtupid, unfeeling, and ſenſeleſs being; poſſeſſed indeed of a perſonal courage, but void of thoſe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential qualities which diſtinguiſh the commander from the common ſoldier.</p>
               <p>A very long, uninterrupted, impartial, I will add, a moſt diſintereſted, friendſhip with Lord Granby, gives me the right to affirms that all Junius's aſſertions are falſe and ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous. Lord Granby's courage, though of the brighteſt and moſt ardent kind, is among the loweſt of his numerous good qualities; he was formed to excel in war by nature's liberality to his mind s well as perſon. Educated and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by his moſt noble father, and a moſt ſpirited as well as excellent ſcholar, the preſent Biſhop of Bangor, he was trained to the niceſt ſenſe of honour, and to the trueſt and nobleſt ſort of pride, that of never doing or ſuffering a mean action. A ſincere love and attachment to his king and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and to their glory, firſt impelled him to the field, where he never gained aught but honour. He impaired, through his bounty, his own fortune: for his bounty, which this wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter would in vain depreciate, is founded upon the nobleſt of the human affections; it flows from a heart melting to good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the moſt refined humanity. Can a man, who is
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023477_0026_0FBFB495AB1C7BD8"/>deſcribed as unfeeling and void of reflection, be conſtantly employed in ſeeking proper objects on whom to exerciſe thoſe glorious virtues of compaſſion and generoſity? The diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed officer, the ſoldier, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, the orphan, and a long liſt beſides, know that vanity has no ſhare in his frequent donations; he gives, becauſe he feels their diſtreſſes. Nor has he ever been rapacious with one hand, to be bountiful with the other. Yet this uncandid Junius would inſinuate, that the dignity of commander in chief is depraved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the baſe office of commiſſion-broker; that is, Lord Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by bargains for the ſale of commiſſions: for it muſt have this meaning, if it has any at all. But where is the man living who can juſtly charge his Lordſhip with ſuch mean practices? Why does not Junius produce him: junius knows that he has no other means of wounding this hero, than from ſome miſſile weapon, ſhot from an obſcure corner: He ſeeks, as all defamatory writers do,

Hence it is, that they are conſtantly aiming their dark and too often fatal weapons againſt thoſe who ſtand forth as the bulwark of our national ſafety. Lord Granby was too conſpicuous a mark not to be their object. He is next attacked for being unfaithful to his promiſes and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements: Where are Junius's proofs? Although I could give ſome inſtances, where a breach of promiſe would be a virtue, eſpecially in the caſe of thoſe who would pervert the open, unſuſpecting moments of convivial mirth, into ſly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidious applications for preferment or party-ſyſtems, and would endeavour to ſurpriſe a good man, who cannot bear to ſee any one leave him diſſatisfied, into unguarded promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. Lord Granby's attention to his own family and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is called ſelfiſh. Had he not attended to them, when fair and juſt opportunities preſented themſelves, I ſhould have thought him unfeeling, and void of reflection indeed.

It is unfair to ſuppoſed that Lord Granby's friends have art as much merit as the friends of any other great man: If he is generous at the public expence, as Junius inſidiouſly calls it, the public is at no more expence for his Lordſhip's friends, than it would be if any other ſet of men poſſeſſed thoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices. The charge is ridiculous!</p>
               <p>The laſt charge againſt Lord Granby is of a moſt ſerious and alarming nature indeed. Junius aſſorts, that the army is mouldering away for want of the direction of a man of common abilities and ſpirit. The preſent condition of the army gives the directeſt lie to his aſſertions. It was never up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a more reſpectable footing with regard to diſcipline, and all the eſſentials that can form good ſoldiers. Lord Ligonier delivered a firm and noble palladium of our ſafeties into Lord Granby's hands, who has kept it in the ſame good order in which he received it. The ſtricteſt care has been taken to fill up the vacant commiſſions, with ſuch gentlemen as have the glory of their anceſtors to ſupport, as well as their own, and are doubly bound to the cauſe of their king and country. from motives of private property, as well as public ſpirit. The adjutant-general. who has the immediate care of the troops after Lord Granby, is an officer that would do great honour to any ſervice in Europe, for his correct arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, good ſenſe and diſcernment upon all occaſions, and for a punctuality and preciſion which give the moſt entire ſatisfaction to all who are obliged to conſult him.

Their reports of the condition of the army are much more to be credited than thoſe of Junius, whom I do adviſe to atone, for his ſhameful aſperſions, by aſking pardon of Lord Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by and the whole kingdom, whom he has offended by his abominable ſcandals. In ſhort, to turn Junius's own battery againſt him, I muſt aſſert, in his own words, "that he has given ſtrong aſſertions without proof, declamation without argument, and violent cenſures without dignity or modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</p>

               <p>YOUR defence of Lord Granby does honour to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your heart. You feel, as you ought to do, for the reputation of your friend, and you expreſs yourſelf in the warmeſt language of your paſſions. In any other cauſe.

As to his ſervile ſubmiſſion to the reigning miniſtry, let me aſk, whether he did not deſert the cauſe of the whole army when he ſuffered Sir Jeffery Amherſt to be ſacrificed, and what ſhare he had in recalling that officer to the ſervice? Did he not betray the juſt intereſt of the army, in permitting Lord Percy to have a regiment? And does he not at this moment give up all character and dignity as a

               <p>In the two next articles I think we are agreed. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly admit, that he often makes ſuch promiſes as it is a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in him to violate, and that no man is more aſſiduous to provide for his relations at the public expence.

None but an intimate friend, who muſt frequently have ſeen him in theſe unhappy, diſgraceful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, could have deſcribed him ſo well.</p>
               <p>The laſt charge, of the neglect of the army, is indeed the moſt material of all. I am forty to tell you, Sir William, that, in this article, your firſt fact is falſe; and as there is nothing more painful to me than to give a direct contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to a gentleman of your appearance, I could wiſh that, in your future publications, you would pay a greater atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the truth of your premiſes, before you ſuffer your genius to hurry you to a concluſion.

As to the ſtate of the army, I ſhould be glad to know where you have received your intelligence, Was it in the rooms at Bath, or at your retreat at Clifton? The reports of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewing generals comprehend only a few regiments in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, which, as they are immediately under the royal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection. are perhaps in ſome tolerable order.

               <p>Permit me now, Sir William, to addreſs myſelf perſonally to you, by way of thanks for the honour of your corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence. You are by no means undeſerving of notice; and it may be of conſequence even to Lord Granby to have it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, whether or no the man, who has praiſed him ſo laviſhly, be himſelf deſerving of praiſe. When you returned to Europe, you zealouſly undertook the cauſe of that gallant army, by whoſe bravery at Manilla your own fortune had been eſtabliſhed. You complained, you threatened, you even appealed to the public in print. By what accident did it happen, that in the midſt of all this buſtle, and all theſe cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours for juſtice to your injured troops, the name of the Manilla ranſom was ſuddenly buried in a profound, and, ſince that time, an uninterrupted ſilence. Did the miniſtry ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt any motives to you, ſtrong enough to tempt a man of honour to deſert and betray the cauſe of his fellow-ſoldiers? Was it that bluſhing riband, which is now the perpetual or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament of your perſon? Or was it that regiment, which you afterwards (a thing unprecedented among ſoldiers) ſold to Colonel Giſborne? Or was it that government, the full pay of which you are contented to hold, with the half-pay of an Iriſh colonel? And do you now, after a retreat not very like that of Scipio, preſume to intrude yourſelf, unthought-of, uncalled-for, upon the patience of the public? Are your flatteries of the commander in chief directed to another regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which you may again diſpoſe of on the ſame honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able terms?

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  <date>FEBRUARY 17, 1769.</date>
               </opener>
               <p>I RECEIVED Junius's favour laſt night: he is determined to keep his advantage by the help of his maſk; it is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent protection, it has ſaved many a man from an untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:023477_0032_0FBFB4A7AB200DE8"/>end. But whenever he will be honeſt enough to lay it aſide, avow himſelf, and produce the face which has ſo long lurked behind it, the world will be able to judge of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives for writing ſuch infamous invectives. His real name will diſcover his freedom and independency, or his ſervility to a faction. Diſappointed ambition, reſentment for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated hopes, and deſire of revenge, aſſume but too often the appearance of public ſpirit; but be his deſigns wicked or charitable, Junius ſhould learn, that it is poſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn meaſures, without a barbarous and criminal outrage againſt men. Junius delights to mangle carcaſes with a hatchet; his language and inſtrument have a great connection with Clare-Market, and to do him juſtice, he handles his weapon moſt admirably. One would imagine be had been taught to throw it by the ſavages of America. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore high time for me to ſtep in once more to ſhield my friend from this mercileſs weapon, although I may be wounded in the attempt. But I muſt firſt aſk Junius, by what forced analogy and conſtruction the moments of convivial mirth are made to ſignify indecency, a violation of engagements, a drunken landlord, and a deſire that every one in company ſhould be drunk likewiſe? He muſt have culled all the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of St. Giles's and Billingſgate to have produced ſuch a piece of oratory. Here the hatchet deſcends with tenfold vengeance; but, alas! it hurts no one but its maſter! For Junius muſt not think to put words into my mouth, that ſeem too foul even for his own.</p>
               <p>My friend's political engagements I know not; ſo cannot pretend to explain them, or aſſert their conſiſtency. I know not whether Junius be conſiderable enough to belong to any party; if he ſhould be ſo, can he affirm that he has always adhered to one ſet of men and meaſures? Is be ſure that he has never ſided with thoſe whom he was firſt hired to abuſe? Has he never abuſed thoſe he was hired to praiſe? To ſay the truth, moſt men's politics ſit much too looſely about them. But as my friend's military character was the chief object that engaged me in this controverſy, to that I ſhall return.</p>
               <p>Junius aſks, What inſtances my friend has given of his military ſkill and capacity as a general? When and where he gained his honour? When he deſerved his emoluments? The united voice of the army which ſerved under him, the glorious teſtimony of Prince Ferdinand, and of vanquiſhed
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:023477_0033_0FBFB4AA1A5C7960"/>enemies, all Germany will tell him. Junius repeats the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the army againſt parliamentary influence. I love the army too well, not to wiſh that ſuch influence were leſs. Let Junius point out the time when it has not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. It was of the leaſt force in the time of that great man, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Duke of Cumberland, who, as a prince of the blood, was able as well as willing to ſtem a torrent which would have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne any private ſubject. In time of war this influence is ſmall. In peace, when diſcontent and faction have the ſure means to operate, eſpecially in this country, and when, from a ſcarcity of public ſpirit the wheels of government are rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moved but by the power and force of obligations, its weight is always too great. Yet if this influence at preſeat has done no greater harm than the placing Earl Percy at the head of a regiment, I do not think that either the rights or beſt intereſts of the army are ſacrificed and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> or the nation undone. Let me aſk Junius, if he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> any one nobleman in the army, who has had a regiment by ſeniority? I feel myſelf happy in ſeeing young noblemen of illustrate name and great property come among us. They are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>itional ſecurity to the kingdom from foreign or domestic ſlavery. Junius needs not be told, that ſhould the time ever come, when this nation is to be defended only by thoſe who have nothing more to loſe than their arms and their pay, its danger will be great indeed. A happy mixture of men of quality with ſoldiers of fortune is always to be wiſhed for. But the main point is ſtill to be contended for. I mean the diſcipline and condition of the army; and I muſt ſtill maintain, though contradicted by Junius, that it was never upon a more reſpectable footing, as to all the eſſentials that can form good ſoldiers, than it is at preſent. Junius is forced to allow, that our army at home may be in ſome tolerable order; yet how kindly does he invite our late enemies to the invaſion of Ireland, by aſſuring them, that the army in that kingdom is totally ruined! (The colonels of that army are much obliged to him.) I have too great an opinion of the military talents of the Lord Lieutenant and of ail their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and capacity to believe it. If from ſome ſtrange, unaccountable fatality, the people of that kingdom cannot be induced to conſult their own ſecurity by ſuch an effectual augmentation as may enable the troops there to act with pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and energy, is the commander in chief here to blame? Or
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:023477_0034_0FBFB4B09EE1EA10"/>is be to blame, becauſe the troops in the Mediterranean, in the Weſt Indies, in America, labour ander great difficulties for the ſcarcity of men, which is but too viſible all over theſe kingdoms? Many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

               <p>I muſt now take the liberty to talk to Junius on my own account. He is pleaſed to tell me that he addreſſes himſelf to me <hi>perfectly:</hi> I ſhall be glad to ſee him. It is his <hi>

                  </gap> motives; a ſtrong inclination to aſſiſt injured bravery, and to acquire a well deſerved po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pularity to themſelves. Their efforts have been in vain. Some were ingenuous enough to own, that they could not think of involving this diſtreſſed nation into another <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> for our private concerns. In ſhort, our rights for the preſent are ſacrificed to national convenience; and I muſt confeſs,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:023477_0035_0FBFB4B6DEAB3628"/>that although I may loſe five-and-twenty thouſand pounds by their acquieſcence to this breach of faith in the Spaniards, I think they are in the right to temporize, conſidering the critical ſituation of this country, convulſed in every part by poiſon infuſed by anonymous, wicked, and incendiary wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Lord Shelburne will do me the juſtice to own, that, in September laſt, I waited upon him with a joint memori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al from the admiral Sir S. Corniſh and myſelf, in behalf of our injured companions. His lordſhip was as frank upon the occaſion as other ſecretaries had been before him. He did not deceive us by giving any immediate hopes of relief.</p>
               <p>Junius would baſely inſinnate, that my ſilence may have been purchaſed by my government, by my <hi>bluſhing</hi> riband, by my regiment, by the ſale of that regiment, and by half-pay as an Iriſh colonel.</p>
               <p>His majeſty was pleaſed to give me my government for my ſervice at Madras. I had my firſt regiment in 175<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. Upon my return from Manilla, his Majeſty, by Lord Egremont, informed me that I ſhould have the firſt vacant red riband, as a reward for many ſervices in an enterprize which I had planned as well as executed. The Duke of Bedford and Mr. Grenville confirmed thoſe aſſurances many months before the Spaniards had proteſted the ranſom bills. To accommodate Lord Clive, then going upon a moſt important ſervice to Bengal, I waved my claim to the vacancy which then hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened. As there was no other vacancy until the Duke of Graf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on and Lord Rockingham were joint miniſters, I was then honoured with the order: and it is ſurely no ſmall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to me, that in ſuch a ſucceſſion of miniſters, they were all pleaſed to think that I had deſerved it: in my favour they were all united. Upon the reduction of the 79th regiment, which had ſerved ſo gloriouſly in the Eaſt Indies, his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, unſolicited by me, gave me the 16th of foot as an equivalent. My motives ſo retiring afterwards are foreign to the purpoſe: Het it ſuffice, that his Majeſty was pleaſed to approve of them; they are ſuch as no man can think inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, who knows the ſhocks that repeated viciſſitudes of heat and cold, of dangerous and ſickly climates, will give to the beſt conſtitutions in a pretty long courſe of ſervice.

If this be bribery, it is not the bribery of theſe times. As to my flattery, thoſe who know me will judge of it. By the aſperity of Junius's ſtyle, I cannot indeed call him a flatterer, unleſs be be as a cynick, or a maſtiff; if he wags his tail, he will ſtill growl and long to bite. The public will now judge of the credit that ought to be given to Junius's writings, from the falſities that he has infinuated with reſpect to myſelf.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  <date>FEBRUARY 21, 1769.</date>
               </opener>
               <p>I SHOULD juſtly be ſuſpected of acting upon motives of more than common enmity to Lord Granby, if I continued to give you freſh materials or occaſion for writing in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Individuals who hate, and the public who deſpiſe, have read <hi>your</hi> letters, Sir William, with infinitely more ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction than mine. Unfortunately for him, his reputation, like that unhappy country to which you refer me for his laſt military atchievements, has ſuffered more by his friends than his enemies. In mercy to him, let us drop the ſubject. For my own part, I willingly leave it to the public to determine whether your vindication of your friend has been as able and judicious, as it was certainly well intended; and you, I think, may be ſatisſied with the warm acknowledgments he already owes you for making him the principal figure in a piece, in which, but for your amicable aſſiſtance, he might have paſſed without particular notice or diſtinction.</p>
               <p>In juſtice to your friends, let your future labours be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the care of your own reputation. Your declaration, that you are happy in ſeeing young noblemen <hi>come among us,</hi> is liable to two objections. With reſpect to Lord Percy, it means nothing, for he was already in the army. He was aid-de-camp to the King, and had the rank of colonel. A
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:023477_0037_0FBFB4BBE12B16C0"/>regiment therefore could not make him a more military are though it made him richer, and probably at the expence of ſome brave, deſerving, friendleſs officer.—The other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns yourſelf.—After ſelling the companions of your victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in one inſtance, and after ſelling your profeſſion in the other, by what authority do you preſume to call yourſelf a ſoldier? The plain evidence of facts is ſuperior to all decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Before you were appointed to the 16th regiment, your complaints were a diſtreſs to government;—from that moment you were ſilent. The concluſion is inevitable. You inſinuate to us that your ill ſtate of health obliged you to quit the ſervice. The retirement neceſſary to repair a broken conſtitution would have been as good a reaſon for not accepting, as for reſigning, the command of a regiment. There is certainly an error of the preſs, or an affected ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity in that paragraph, where you ſpeak of your bargain with Colonel Giſborne. Inſtead of artempting to anſwer what I do not really underſtand, permit me to explain to the public what I really know. In exchange for your regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you accepted of a colonel's half-pay (at leaſt 220 <abbr>l.</abbr> a year) and an annuity of 200 <abbr>l.</abbr> for your own and Lady Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per's life jointly.—And is this the loſing bargain, which you would repreſent to us, as if you had given up an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of 800 <abbr>l.</abbr> a year for 380 <abbr>l.</abbr>? Was it decent, was it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, in a man who pretends to love the army, and calls himſelf a ſoldier, to make a traffic of the royal favour, and turn the higheſt honour of an active profeſſion into a ſordid prori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ion for himſelf and his family? It were unworthy of me to preſs you farther. The contempt with which the whole army heard of the manner of your retreat, aſſures me, that as your conduct was not juſtified by precedent, it will never be thought an example for imitation.</p>
               <p>The laſt and moſt important queſtion remains. When you receive your half-pay, do you, or do you not, take a ſolemn oath, or ſign a declaration, upon your honour, to the following effect? <hi>That you do not actually hold any place of profit, civil or military, under his Majesty.</hi> The charge which the queſtion plainly conveys againſt you, is of ſo ſhocking a complexion, that I ſincerely wiſh you may be able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer it well, not merely for the colour of your reputation, but for your own peace of mind.</p>

<p>It has been ſaid, I believe truly, that it was ſignified to Sir William Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per as the requeſt of Lord Granby, that he ſhould deſiſt from writing in his Lordſhip's defence. Sir William Draper certainly drew <hi>Junius</hi> forward to ſay more of Lord Granby's character than he originally intended. He was reduced to the dilemma of either being totally ſilenced, or of ſupporting him firſt letter.

Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your own breaſt, Sir William, and you will diſcover, that reproaches and inquiries have no power to afflict either the man of unblemiſhed intregrity, or the abandoned profligate. It is the middle compound character which alone is vulnerable; the man, who without firmneſs enough to avoid a diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able action, has feeling enough to be aſhamed of it.</p>
               <p>I thank you for the hint of the decalogue, and ſhall take an opportunity of applying it to ſome of your moſt virtuous friends in both houſes of Parliament.</p>
               <p>You ſeem to have dropped the affair of your regiment; ſo let it reſt. When you are appointed to another, I dare ſay you will not ſell it either for a groſs ſum, or for an annuity upon lives.</p>
               <p>I am truly glad (for really, Sir William, I am not your enemy, not did I begin this conteſt with your that you have been able to clear yourſelf of a crime, though at the expence of the higheſt indiſcretion. You ſay that your half-pay was given you by way of penſion. I will not dwell upon the ſingularity of uniting in your own perſon two forts of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which in their own nature, and in all military and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary views, are incompatible: but I call upon you to juſtify that declaration, wherein you charge your Sovereign with having done an act in your favour notoriouſly againſt
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:023477_0040_0FBFB4C501956D10"/>the law. The half-pay, both in Ireland and England, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated by Parliament; and if it be given to perſons who, like you, are legally incapable of holding it, it is a breach of law. It would have been more decent in you to have called this diſhonourable tranſaction by its true name, a job to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate two perſons, by particular intereſt and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the caſtle. What ſenſe muſt government have had of your ſervices, when the rewards they have given you are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a diſgrace to you!</p>
               <p>And now, Sir William, I ſhall take my leave of you for ever. Motives very different from any apprehenſion of your reſentment, make it impoſſible you ſhould ever know me. In truth, you have ſome reaſon to hold yourſelf indebted to me. From the leſſons I have given you, you may collect a profitable inſtruction for your future life. They will either teach you ſo to regulate your conduct, as to be able to ſet the moſt malicious inquiries at defiance; or, if that be a loſt hope, they will teach you prudence enough not to attract the public attention to a character, which will only paſs without cenſure, when it paſſes without obſervation.</p>

               <p>BEFORE you were placed at the head of affairs, it had been a maxim of the Engliſh government, not unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly admitted by the people, that every ungracious or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere exertion of the prerogative ſhould be placed to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Miniſter; but that, whenever an act of grace or benevolence was to be performed, the whole merit of it ſhould be attributed to the Sovereign himſelf<note n="*" place="bottom">Les <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </note>. It was a wiſe doctrine, my Lord, and equally advantageous to the King and his ſubject; for while it preſerved that ſuſpicious attention, with which the people ought always to examine the conduct of miniſters, it tended at the ſame time rather to increaſe than diminiſh their attachment to the perſon of their Sovereign. If there be not a fatality attending every meaſure you are concerned in, by what treachery, or by what exceſs of folly, has it happened, that thoſe ungracious acts which have diſtinguiſhed your adminiſtration, and which I doubt not were entirely your own, ſhould carry with then a ſtrong appearance of perſonal intereſt, and even of perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal enmity, in a quarter where no ſuch intereſt or enmity can be ſuppoſed to exiſt without the higheſt injuſtice and the higheſt diſhonour? On the other hand, by what injudicious management have you contrived it, that the only act of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, to which you have ever adviſed your Sovereign, far from adding to the luſtre of a character truly gracious and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent, ſhould be received with univerſal diſapprobation and diſguſt? I ſhall conſider it as a miniſterial meaſure, becauſe it is an odious one; and as your meaſure, my Lord Duke, becauſe you are the miniſter.</p>
               <p>As long as the trial of this chairman was depending, it was natural enough that government ſhould give him every poſſible encouragement and ſupport. The honourable ſervice for which he was hired, and the ſpirit with which he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it, made a common cauſe between your Grace and
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:023477_0042_0FBFB4CFAE70CF28"/>him. The miniſter, who by ſecret corruption invades the freedom of elections, and the ruffian, who by open violence deſtroys that freedom, are embarked in the ſame bottom. They have the ſame intereſts, and mutually feel for each other. To do juſtice to your Grace's humanity, you felt for M'Quirk as you ought to do; and if you had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to aſſiſt him indirectly, without a notorious denial of juſtice, or openly inſulting the ſenſe of the nation, you might have ſatisfied every duty of political friendſhip, without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muting the honour of your Sovereign, or hazarding the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of his government. But when this unhappy man had been ſolemnly tried, convicted, and condemned;—when it appeared that he had been frequently employed in the ſame ſervices, and that no excuſe for him could be drawn either from the innocence of his former life, or the ſimplicity of his character; was it not hazarding too much to interpoſe the ſtrength of the prerogative between this felon and the juſtice of his country<note n="*" place="bottom">

What ſyſtem of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is this? You are perpetually complaining of the riot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſpoſition of the lower claſs of people; yet when the laws have given you the means of making an example in every ſenſe unexceptionable, and by far the moſt likely to awe the multitude, you pardon the offence, and are not aſhamed to give the ſanction of government to the riots you complain of, and even to future murders. You are partial perhaps to the military mode of execution; and had rather ſee a ſcore of theſe wretches butchered by the guards, than one of them ſuffer death by regular courſe of law. How does it happen, my Lord, that, in <hi>your</hi> hands, even the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the prerogative is cruelty and oppreſſion to the ſubject?</p>

               <p>Now, my Lord, let me aſk you, Has it never occurred to your Grace, while you were withdrawing this deſperate wretch from that juſtice which the laws had awarded, and which the whole people of England demanded againſt him, that there is another man, who is the favourite of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, whoſe pardon would have been accepted with gratitude, whoſe pardon would have healed all our diviſions? Have you quite forgotten that this man was once your Grace's friend; Or is it to murderers only that you will extend the mercy of the crown?</p>
               <p>Theſe are queſtions you will not anſwer, nor is it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The character of your private life, and the tenor of your public conduct, is an anſwer to them all.</p>

                  </gap>an. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſtep you took to make Sir James Lowther lord paramount of Cumberland, has ruined his intereſt in that county for ever. The Houſe Liſt of Directors was curſed with the concurrence of government; and even the miſerable<note n="*" place="bottom">This unfortunate perſon had been perſuaded by the Duke of Grafton to ſet up for Middleſex, his Grace being determined to ſeat him in the Houſe of Commons if he had but a ſingle vote. It happened unluckily that he could not prevail upon any one freeholder to put him in nomination.</note> Dingley could not eſcape the misfortune of your Grace's protection. With this uniform experience before us, we are authoriſed to ſuſpect, that when a pretended vindication of your principles and conduct in reality contains the bittereſt reflections upon both, it could not have been written without your immediate direction and aſſiſtance. The author indeed calls God to witneſs for him, with all the ſincerity and in the very terms of an Iriſh evidence, <hi>to the beſt of his knowledge and belief.</hi> My Lord, you ſhould not encourage theſe appeals to Heaven. The pious Prince from whom you are ſuppoſed to deſcend, made ſuch frequent uſe of them in his public de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, that at laſt the people alſo found it neceſſary to appeal to Heaven in their turn. Your adminiſtration has driven us into circumſtances of equal diſtreſs; beware at leaſt how you remind us of the remedy.</p>
               <p>You have already much to anſwer for. You have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked this unhappy gentleman to play the fool once more in public life, in ſpite of his years and infirmities; and to ſhow us, that, as you yourſelf are a ſingular inſtance of youth without ſpirit, the man who defends you is a no leſs remarkable example of age without the benefits of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. To follow ſuch a writer minutely would, like his own periods, be a labour without end. The ſubject too has been already diſcuſſed, and is ſufficiently underſtood. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help obſerving, however, that, when the pardon of M'Quirk was the principal charge againſt you, it would have been but a decent compliment to your Grace's under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to have defended you upon your own principles.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:023477_0046_0FBFB4D81E965A50"/>What credit does a man deſerve, who tells us plainly, that the facts ſet forth in the King's proclamation were not the true motives on which the pardon was granted; and that he wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es that thoſe chirurgical reports, which firſt gave occaſion to certain doubts in the royal breaſt, had not been laid before his Majeſty. You ſee, my Lord, that even your friends cannot defend your actions, without changing your princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; nor juſtify a deliberate meaſure of government, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradicting the main aſſertion on which it was founded.</p>
               <p>The conviction of M'Quirk had reduced you to a dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, in which it was hardly poſſible for you to reconcile your political intereſt with your duty. You were obliged either to abandon an active uſeful partizan, or to protect a felon from public juſtice. With your uſual ſpirit, you preferred your intereſt to every other conſideration; and with your uſual judgment, you founded your determination upon the only motives which ſhould not have been given to the public.</p>
               <p>I have frequently cenſured Mr. Wilkes's conduct; yet your advocate reproaches me with having devoted myſelf to the ſervice of ſedition. Your Grace can beſt inform us, for which of Mr. Wilkes's good qualities you firſt honoured him with your friendſhip, or how long it was before you diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered thoſe bad ones in him at which, it ſeems, your deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy was offended. Remember, my Lord, that you conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued your connection with Mr. Wilkes long after he had been convicted of thoſe crimes which you have ſince taken pains to repreſent in the blackeſt colours of blaſphemy and treaſon. How unlucky is it that the firſt inſtance you have given us of a ſcrupulous regard to decorum, is united with the breach of a moral obligation! For my own part, my Lord, I am proud to affirm, that if I had been weak enough to form ſuch a friendſhip, I would never have been baſe enough to betray it. But let Mr. Wilkes's character be what it may, this at leaſt is certain, that, circumſtanced as he is with regard to the public, even his vices plead for him. The people of England have too much diſcernment to ſuffer your Grace to take advantage of the failings of a private character, to eſtabliſh a precedent by which the public liberty is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and which you may hereafter, with equal eaſe and ſatisfaction, employ to the ruin of the beſt men in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.—Context yourſelf, my Lord, with the many advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:023477_0047_0FBFB4D9331C4638"/>which the unſullied purity of your own character has given you over your unhappy deſerted friend.

               <opener>
                  <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
                  <date>APRIL 24, 1769.</date>
               </opener>
               <p>THE ſyſtem you ſeemed to have adopted, when Lord Chatham unexpectedly left you at the head of affairs, gave us no promiſe of that uncommon exertion of vigour, which has ſince illuſtrated your character, and diſtinguiſhed your adminiſtration. Far from diſcovering a ſpirit bold enough to invade the firſt rights of the people and the firſt principles of the conſtitution, you were ſcrupulous of exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing even thoſe powers with which the executive branch of the legiſlature is legally inveſted. We have not yet forgotten how long Mr. Wilkes was ſuffered to appear at large, nor how long he was at liberty to canvaſs for the city and county, with all the terrors of an outlawry hanging over him. Our Gracious Sovereign has not yet forgotten the extraordinary care you took of his dignity and of the ſafety of his perſon, when, at a criſis which courtiers affected to call alarming, you left the metropolis expoſed, for two nights together, to every ſpecies of riot and diſorder. The ſecurity of the Royal reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from inſult was then ſufficiently provided for in Mr. Conway's firmneſs, and Lord Weymouth's diſcretion; while the prime miniſter of Great Britain, in a rural retirement, and in the arms of faded beauty, had loſt all memory of his Sovereign, his country, and himſelf. In theſe inſtances you
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:023477_0049_0FBFB4E79C07A4D8"/>might have acted with vigour, for you would have had the fanction of the laws to ſupport you. The friends of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might have defended you without ſhame; and moderate men, who wiſh well to the peace and good order of ſociety, might have had a pretence for applauding your conduct. But theſe, it ſeems, were not occaſions worthy of your Grace's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition. You reſerved the proofs of your intrepid ſpirit for trials of greater hazard and importance; and now, as if the moſt diſgraceful relaxation of the executive authority had given you a claim of credit to indulge in exceſſes ſtill more dangerous, you ſeem determined to compenſate amply for your former negligence, and to balance the non-execution of the laws with a breach of the conſtitution. From one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme you ſuddenly ſtart to the other, without leaving, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the weakneſs and the fury of the paſſions, one moment's interval for the firmneſs of the underſtanding.</p>
               <p>Theſe obſervations, general as they are, might eaſily be extended into a faithful hiſtory of your Grace's adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and perhaps may be the employment of a future hour. But the buſineſs of the preſent moment will not ſuffer me to look back to a ſeries of events, which ceaſe to be intereſting or important, becauſe they are ſucceeded by a meaſure ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aring, that it excites all our attention, and engroſſes all our reſentment,</p>
               <p>Your patronage of Mr. Luttrell has been crowned with ſucceſs. With this precedent before you, with the principles on which it was eſtabliſhed, and with a future Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, perhaps leſs virtuous than the preſent, every county in England, under the auſpices of the treaſury, may be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as completely as the county of Middleſex. Poſterity will be indebted to your Grace for not contenting yourſelf with a temporary expedient, but entailing upon them the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate bleſſings of your adminiſtration. Boroughs were already too much at the mercy of government. Counties could neither be purchaſed nor intimidated. But their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn determined election may be rejected, and the man they deteſt may be appointed, by another choice, to repreſent them in Parliament. Yet it is admitted, that the ſheriffs obeyed the laws, and performed their duty<note n="*" place="bottom">Sir Fletcher Norton, when it was propoſed to puniſh the Sheriffs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the Houſe of Commons that they, in returning Mr. Wilkes, had done no more than their duty.</note>. The return they made
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:023477_0050_0FBFB4E8E2517DF0"/>muſt have been legal and valid, or undoubtedly they would have been cenſured for making it. With every good-natured allowance for your Grace's youth and inexperience, there are ſome things which you cannot but know. You cannot but know that the right of the freeholders to adhere to their choice (even ſuppoſing it improperly exerted) was as clear and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable as that of the Houſe of Commons to exclude one of their own members?—Nor is it poſſible for you not to ſee the wide diſtance there is between the negative power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting one man, and the poſitive power of appointing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. The right of expulſion, in the moſt favourable ſenſe, is no more than the cuſtom of Parliament. The right of election is the very eſſence of the conſtitution. To violate that right, and much more to transfer it to any other ſet of men, is a ſtep leading immediately to the diſſolution of all government. So far forth as it operates, it conſtitutes a Houſe of Commons which <hi>does not</hi> repreſent the people. A Houſe of Commons ſo formed would involve a contradiction and the groſſeſt confuſion of ideas; but there are ſome miniſters, my Lord, whoſe views can only be anſwered by reconciling ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, and making the ſame propoſition, which is falſe and abſurd in argument, true in fact.</p>
               <p>This meaſure, my Lord, is however attended with one conſequence favourable to the people, which I am perſuaded you did not foreſee<note n="*" place="bottom">The reader is deſued to mark this prophecy.</note>. While the conteſt ſay between the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry and Mr. Wilkes, his ſituation and private character gave you advantages over him, which common candour, if not the memory of your former friendſhip, ſhould have forbidden you to make uſe of. To religious men, you had an opportunity of exaggerating the irregularities of his paſt life;—to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate men, you held forth the pernicious conſequences of faction. Men, who with this character looked no farther than to the object before them, were not diſſatisfied at ſeeing Mr. Wilkes excluded from Parliament. You have now taken care to ſhift the queſtion; or rather, you have created a new one, in which Mr. Wilkes is no more concerned than any other Engliſh gentleman. You have united this country againſt you on one grand conſtitutional point, on the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of which our exiſtence, as a free people, abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peads. You have aſſerted, not in words but in fact, that
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:023477_0051_0FBFB4EA63A54268"/>the repreſentation in Parliament does not depend upon the choice of the freeholders. If ſuch a caſe can poſſibly happen once, it may happen frequently; it may happen always:—and if three hundred rotes, by any mode of reaſoning what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, can prevail againſt twelve hundred, the ſame reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would equally have given Mr. Luttrell his ſeat with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> votes, or even with one. The conſequences of this attack upon the conſtitution, are too plain and palpable not to alarm the dulleſt apprehenſion. I truſt you will find, that the people of England are neither deficient in ſpirit nor under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, though you have treated them as if they had nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſenſe to feel, nor ſpirit to reſent. We have reaſon to thank God and our anceſtors, that there never yet was a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in this country, who could ſtand the iſſue of ſuch a conflict: and with every prejudice in favour of your intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I ſee o ſuch abilities in your Grace, as ſhould entitle you to ſucc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

You have had the merit of introducing a more compendious ſyſtem of government and logic. You neither addreſs yourſelf to the paſſions, nor to the underſtanding, but ſimply to the touch.

<pb n="51" facs="unknown:023477_0054_0FBFB4F5CC5ECB38"/>From Newmarket, White's, and the oppoſition, he gave you to the world with an air of popularity, which young men uſually ſet out with, and ſeldom preſerve:—grave and plauſible enough to be thought fit for buſineſs; too young for treachery; and, in ſhort, a patriot of no unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing expectations, Lord Chatham was the earlieſt object of your political wonder and attachment; yet you deſerted him, upon the firſt hopes that offered of an equal ſhare of power with Lord Rockingham. When the Duke of Cumberland's firſt negociation failed, and when the favourite was puſhed to the laſt extremity, you ſaved him by joining with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration in which Lord Chatham had refuſed to engage. Still, however, he was your friend: and you are yet to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to the world, why you conſented to act without him; or why, after uniting with Lord Rockingham, you deſerted and betrayed him. You complained that no meaſures were taken to ſatisfy your patron; and that your friend Mr. Wilkes, who had ſuffered ſo much for the party, had been abandoned to his fate. They have ſince contributed, not a little to your preſent plenitude of power: yet I think Lord Chatham has leſs reaſon than ever to be ſatisfied; and as for Mr. Wilkes, it is, perhaps, the greateſt misfortune of his life that you ſhould have ſo many compenſations to make in the cloſet for your former friendſhip with him. Your gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious maſter underſtands your character, and makes you a perſecutor, becauſe you have been a friend.</p>
               <p>Lord Chatham formed his laſt adminiſtration upon princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which you certainly concurred in, or you could never have been placed at the head of the treaſury. By deſerting thoſe principles, and by acting in direct contradiction to them, in which he found you were ſecretly ſupported in the cloſet, you ſoon forced him to leave you to yourſelf, and to withdraw his name from an adminiſtration which had been formed on the credit of it. You had then a proſpect of friendſhips better ſuite to your genius, and more likely to fix your diſpoſition.

But ties of this tender nature cannot be drawn too cloſe; and it may poſſibly be a part of the Duke of Bedford's ambition, after making <hi>her</hi> an honeſt woman, to work a miracle of the ſame ſort upon your Grace.

               <p>You Grace's public conduct, as a miniſter, is but the counter part of your private hiſtory;—the ſame inconſiſtency, the ſame contradictions. In America, we trace you, from the firſt oppoſition to the Stamp-Act, on principles of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, to Mr. Pitt's ſurrender of the right: then forward to Lord Rockingham's ſurrender of the fact; then back again to Lord Rockingham's declaration of the right; then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to taxation with Mr. Townſhend; and, in the laſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, from the gentle Conway's undetermined diſcretion, to blood and compulſion with the Duke of Bedford: Yet, if we may believe the ſimplicity of Lord North's eloquence, at the opening of next ſeſſions you are once more to be the patron of America. Is this the wiſdom of a great miniſter? or is it the ominous vibration of a pendulum? Had you no opinion of your own, my Lord? or was it the gratification of betraying every party with which you have been united, and of deſerting every political principle in which you had concurred?</p>

They are of ſuch a nature, that I think a hare contradiction will have no weight with any man who judges for himſelf. Let us take them in the order in which they appear in his laſt letter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Have not the firſt rights of the people, and the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the conſtitution, been openly invaded, and the very name of an election made ridiculous, by the arbitrary appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Mr. Luttrell?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Did not the Duke of Grafton frequently lead his miſtreſs into public, and even place her at the head of his table, as if he had pulled down an ancient temple of Venus, and could bury all decency and ſhame under the ruins?—Is this the man who dares to talk of Mr. Wilkes's morals?</p>

               <p n="9">9. Has not Sir John Moore a penſion of five hundred pounds a year?—This may probably be an acquittance of favours upon the turf; but is it poſſible for a miniſter to offer a groſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer outrage to a nation, which has ſo very lately cleared away the beggary of the civil liſt at the expence of more than half a million?</p>
               <p n="10">10. Is there any one mode of thinking or acting with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to America, which the Duke of Grafton has not ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively adopted and abandoned?</p>
               <p n="11">11. Is there not a ſingular mark of ſhame ſet upon this man, who has ſo little delicacy and feeling as to ſubmit to the opporbium of marrying a near relation of one who had debauched his wife?—In the name of decency, how are theſe amiable couſins to meet at their uncle's table?—It will be a ſcene in Cedipus, without the diſtreſs—Is it wealth, or wit, or beauty—or is the amorous youth in love?</p>
               <p>The reſt is notorious.

The Doctor recollected that he had a place to preſerve, though he forgot that he had a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to loſe. We have now the good fortune to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the Doctor's principles, as well as writings. For the defence of truth, of law, and reaſon, the Doctor's book may be ſafely conſulted; but whoever wiſhes to cheat a neighbour of his eſtate, or to rob a country of its rights, need make no ſcruple of conſulting the Doctor himſelf.</p>
               <p>The example of the Engliſh nobility may, for aught I know, ſufficiently juſtify the Duke of Grafton, when he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulges his genius in all the faſhionable exceſſes of the age; yet, conſidering his rank and ſtation, I think it would do him more honour to be able to deny the fact, than to defend it by ſuch authority. But if vice itſelf could be excuſed, there is yet a certain diſplay of it, a certain outrage to decency, and violation of public decorum, which, for the benefit of ſociety, ſhould never be forgiven. It is not that he kept a miſtreſs at home, but that he conſtantly attended her abroad. It is not the private indulgence, but the public inſult, of which I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. The name of Miſs Parſons would hardly have been known, if the Firſt Lord of the Treaſury had not led her in triumph through the Opera-houſe, even in the preſence of the Queen. When we ſee a man act in this manner, we may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the ſhameleſs depravity of his heart: but what are we to think of his underſtanding?</p>
               <p>His Grace, it ſeems, is now to be a regular domeſtic man; and as an omen of the future delicacy and correctneſs of his conduct, he marries a firſt couſin of the man who has fixed that mark and title of infamy upon him, which, at the ſame moment, makes a huſband unhappy and ridiculous. The ties of conſanguinity may poſſibly preſerve him from the ſame fate a ſecond time; and as to the diſtreſs of meeting, I take for granted the venerable uncle of theſe common couſins has ſettled the etiquette in ſuch a manner, that if a miſtake ſhould happen, it may reach no farther than from <hi>Madame ma femme</hi> to <hi>Madame ma couſine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Duke of Grafton has always ſome excellent reaſon for deſerting his friends—The age and incapacity of Lord Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham—the debility of Lord Rockingham—or the infamy of Mr. Wilkes. There was a time, indeed, when he did
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:023477_0062_0FBFB50F30B880F0"/>not appear to be quite ſo well acquainted, or ſo violently of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, with the infirmities of his friends. But now I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs they are not ill exchanged for the youthful, vigorous virtue of the Duke of Bedford;—the firmneſs of General Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way;—the blunt, or if I may call it the aukward, integrity of Mr. Rigby;—and the ſpotleſs morality of Lord Sandwich.</p>
               <p>If a late penſion to a<note n="*" place="bottom">Sir John Moore.</note> broken gambler be an act worthy of commendation, the Duke of Grafton's connexions will furniſh him with many opportunities of doing praiſe-worthy actions; and as he himſelf bears no part of the expence, the generoſity of diſtributing the public money for the ſupport of virtuous families in diſtreſs, will be an unqueſtionable proof of his Grace's humanity.</p>
               <p>As to the public affairs, <hi>Old Noll</hi> is a little tender of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to particulars.

               <head>LETTER XV. TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF GRAFTON.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
                  <date>JULY 8, 1769.</date>
               </opener>
               <p>IF nature had given you an underſtanding qualified to keep pace with the wiſhes and principles of your heart, ſhe would have made you, perhaps, the moſt formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miniſter that ever was employed, under a limited mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, to accompliſh the ruin of a free people. When nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the feelings of ſhame, the reproaches of conſcience, not the dread of puniſhment, form any bar to the deſigns of a miniſter, the people would have too much reaſon to lament their condition, if they did not find ſome reſource in the weakneſs of his underſtanding. We owe it to the bounty of Providence, that the completeſt depravity of the heart is ſometimes ſtrangely united with a confuſion of the mind, which counteracts the moſt favourite principles, and makes the ſame man treacherous without art, and a hypocrite with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deceiving. The meaſures, for inſtance, in which your Grace's activity has been chiefly exerted, as they were adopted without ſkill, ſhould have been conducted with more than common dexterity. But truly, my Lord, the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has been as groſs as the deſign. By one deciſive ſtep, you have defeated all the arts of writing. You have fairly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded the intrigues of oppoſition, and ſilenced the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of faction. A dark, ambiguous ſyſtem might require and furniſh the materials of ingenious illuſtration; and in doubtful meaſures, the virulent exaggeration of party muſt be employed, to rouſe and engage the paſſions of the people. You have now brought the merits of your adminiſtration to an iſſue, on which every Engliſhman, of the narroweſt capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, may determine for himſelf. It is not an alarm to the paſſions, but a calm appeal to the judgment of the people, upon their own moſt eſſential intereſts. A more experienced miniſter would not have hazarded a direct invaſion of the firſt principles of the conſtitution, before he had made ſome progreſs in ſubduing the ſpirit of the people. With ſuch a cauſe as your's, my Lord, it is not ſufficient that you have the Court at your devotion, unleſs you can find means to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:023477_0064_0FBFB51765650F20"/>or intimidate the jury. The collective body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple form that jury, and from <hi>their</hi> deciſion there is but one appeal.</p>
               <p>Whether you have talents to ſupport you, at a criſis of ſuch difficulty and danger, ſhould long ſince have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered. Judging truly of your diſpoſition, you have perhaps miſtaken the extent of your capacity. Good faith and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have ſo long been received as ſynonymous terms, that the reverſe propoſition has grown into credit, and every villain fancies himſelf a man of abilities. It is the apprehenſion of your friends, my Lord, that you have drawn ſome haſty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this ſort, and that a partial reliance upon your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral character has betrayed you beyond the depth of your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. You have now carried things too far to retreat. You have plainly declared to the people what they are to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from the continuance of your adminiſtration. It is time for your Grace to conſider what you alſo may expect in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from <hi>their</hi> ſpirit and <hi>their</hi> reſentment.</p>
               <p>Since the acceſſion of our moſt gracious Sovereign to the throne, we have ſeen a ſyſtem of government which may well be called a reign of experiments. Parties of all denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations have been employed and diſmiſſed. The advice of the ableſt men in this country has been repeatedly called for and rejected; and when the royal diſpleaſure has been ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to a miniſter, the marks of it have uſually been proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned to his abilities and integrity. The ſpirit of the FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VOURITE had ſome apparent influence upon every adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and every ſet of miniſters preſerved an appearance of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as long as they ſubmitted to that influence. But there were certain ſervices to be performed for the favourites' ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or to gratify his reſentments, which your predeceſſors in office had the wiſdom or the virtue not to undertake. The moment this refractory ſpirit was diſcovered, their diſgrace was determined. Lord Chatham, Mr. Grenville, and Lord Rockingham, have ſucceſſively had the honour to be diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed for preferring their duty, as ſervants of the public, to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſe compliances which were expected from their ſtation. A ſubmiſſive adminiſtration was at laſt gradually collected from the deſerters of all parties, intereſts, and connections; and nothing remained but to find a leader for theſe gallant well-diſciplined troops. Stand forth, my Lord, for thou art the man. Lord Bute found no reſource of dependence or ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:023477_0065_0FBFB51A344FCCC8"/>in the proud impoſing ſuperiority of Lord Chatham's abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, the ſhrewd inflexible judgment of Mr. Grenville, nor in the mild but determined integrity of Lord Rockingham. His views and ſituation requires a creature void of all theſe properties; and he was forced to go through every diviſion, reſolution, compoſition, and refinement of political che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry, before he happily arrived at the caput <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap> or fury which have go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned you whole adminiſtration. Your circumſtances with regard to the people ſoon becoming deſperate, like other honeſt ſervants you determined to involve the beſt of maſters in the ſame difficulties with yourſelf. We owe it to your Grace's well-directed labours, that your Sovereign has been perſuaded to doubt of the affections of his ſubjects, and the people to ſuſpect the virtues of their Sovereign, at a time when both were unqueſtionable. You have degraded the Royal dignity into a baſe and diſhonourable competition with Mr. Wilkes; nor had you abilities to carry even the laſt contemptible triumph over a private man, without the groſſeſt violation of the fundamental laws of the conſtitution and rights of the people. But theſe are rights, my Lord, which you can no more annihilate, than you can the ſoil to which they are annexed. The queſtion no longer turns up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on points of national honour and ſecurity abroad, or on the degrees of expedience and propriety of meaſures at home. It was not inconſiſtent that you ſhould abandon the cauſe of liberty in another country, which you had perſecuted in your own, and in the common arts of domeſtic corruption, we miſs no part of Sir Robert Walpole's ſyſtem, except his abilities. In this humble imitative line, you might long have proceeded, ſafe and contemptible. You might proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly never have riſen to the dignity of being ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  </gap>ble fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bric, which you thought had been too long the admiration of mankind. The uſe you have made of the military force, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced an alarming change in the mode of executing the laws. The arbitrary appointment of Mr. Luttrell in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

With a ſucceſſion of ſuch appointments, we may ſoon ſee a Houſe of Commons collected, in the choice of which the other towns and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of England will have as little ſhare as the devoted coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Middleſex.</p>
               <p>Yet I truſt that your Grace will find, that the people of this country are neither to be intimidated by violent meaſures, nor deceived by refinements. When they ſee Mr. Luttrell ſeated in the Houſe of Commons by mere dint of power, and in direct oppoſition to the choice of a whole county, they will not liſten to thoſe ſubtleties by which every arbitrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of authority is explained into the law and privilege of Parliament. It requires no perſuaſion of argument, but ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the evidence of the ſenſes, to convince them, that to transfer the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

The principles on which this violent meaſure had been defended, have added ſcorn to injury; and forced us to feel, that we are not only oppreſſed, but inſulted.</p>
               <p>With what force, my Lord, with what protection, are you prepared to meet the united deteſtation of the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land? The city of London has given a generous example to the kingdom in what manner a king of this country ought to be addreſſed; and I fancy, my Lord, it is not yet in your courage to ſtand between your Sovereign and the addreſſes of his ſubjects. The injuries you have done this country are ſuch as demand not only redreſs, but vengeance. In vain ſhall you look for protection to that venal vote which you eave already paid for.—Another muſt be purchaſed; and to ſave a miniſter, the Houſe of Commons muſt declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not only independent of their conſtituents, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined enemies of the conſtitution. Conſider, my Lord, whether this be an extremity to which their fears will permit them to advance; or, if <hi>their</hi> protection ſhould fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Truſt not too far to appearances, by which your predeceſſors have been deceived, though they have not been injured. Even the beſt of princes may at laſt diſcover, that this is a contention, in which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing may be loſt, but nothing can be gained; and as you became miniſter by accident, were adopted without choice, truſted without confidence, and continued without favour, be aſſured, that, whenever an occaſion preſſes, you will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded without even the forms of regret. You will then have reaſon to be thankful, if you are permitted to retire to that ſeat of learning, which, in contemplation of the ſyſtem of your life, the comparative purity of your manners with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ate; until at laſt the mind, perplexed and confounded with the endleſs ſubtleties of controverſy, loſes ſight of the main queſtion, and never arrives at truth. Both parties in the diſpute are apt enough to practiſe theſe diſhoneſt artifices. The man who is conſcious of the weakneſs of his cauſe, is intereſted in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealing it; and, on the other ſide, it is not uncommon to ſee a good cauſe mangled by advocates who do not know the real ſtrength of it.</p>
               <p>I ſhould be glad to know, for inſtance, to what purpoſe, in the preſent caſe, ſo many precedents have been produced to prove, That the Houſe of Commons have a right to expel one of their own members; that it belongs to them to judge of the validity of elections; or that the law of Parliament is part of the law of the land<note n="*" place="bottom">The reader will obſerve, that theſe admiſſions are made, not as of truths unqueſtionable, but for the ſake of argument, and in order to bring the real queſtion to iſſue.</note>? After all theſe propoſitions are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, Mr. Luttrell's right to his ſeat will continue to be juſt as diſputable as it was before. Not one of them is at preſent in agitation. Let it be admitted that the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were authoriſed to expel Mr. Wilkes; that they are the proper court to judge of elections; and that the law of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament is binding upon the people; ſtill it remains to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, whether the houſe, by their reſolution in favour of Mr. Luttrell, have or have not truly declared that law. To facilitate this inquiry, I would have the queſtion cleared of all foreign or indifferent matter. The following ſtate of it will probably be thought a fair one by both parties; and then I imagine there is no gentleman in this country, who will not be capable of forming a judicious and true opinion upon it. I take the queſtion to be ſtrictly this: <q>Whether or not it be <g ref="char:startq">“</g>the known, eſtabliſhed law of Parliament, that the expulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a member of the Houſe of Commons of itſelf creates in him ſuch an incapacity to be re-elected, that, at a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent election, any votes given to him are null and void;
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:023477_0069_0FBFB529564C3C98"/>and that any other candidate, who, except the perſon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, has the greateſt number of votes, ought to be the <g ref="char:endq">”</g>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>itting member?</q>
               </p>
               <p>To prove that the affirmative is the law of Parliament, I apprehend it is not ſufficient for the preſent Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to declare it to be ſo. We may ſhut our eyes indeed to the dangerous conſequences of ſuffering one branch of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature to declare new laws, without argument or example, and it may perhaps be prudent enough to ſubmit to authority; but a mere aſſertion will never convince, much leſs will it be thought reaſonable to prove the right by the fact itſelf. The miniſtry have not yet pretended to ſuch a tyranny over our minds. To ſupport the affirmative fairly, it will either be neceſſary to produce ſome ſtatute, in which that poſitive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion ſhall have been made, that ſpecific diſability clearly created, and the conſequences of it declared: or, if there be to ſuch ſtatute, the cuſtom of Parliament muſt then be refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to; and ſome caſe or caſes<note n="*" place="bottom">Precedents, in oppoſition to principles, have little weight with <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius:</hi> but he thought it neceſſary to meet the miniſtry upon their own ground.</note>, ſtrictly in point, muſt be produced, with the deciſion of the court upon them; for I readily admit, that the cuſtom of Parliament, once clearly proved, is equally binding with the common and ſtatute law.</p>
               <p>The conſideration of what may be reaſonable or unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, makes no part of this queſtion. We are inquiring what the law is not what it ought to be. Reaſon may be applied to ſhow the impropriety or experience of a law, but we muſt have either ſtatute or precedent to prove the exiſtence of it. At the ſame time, I do not mean to admit that the late reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Houſe of Commons is defenſible on general prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of reaſon, any more than in law. This is not the hinge on which the debate turns.</p>
               <p>Suppoſing therefore that I have laid down an accurate ſtate of the queſtion, I will venture to affirm, 1ſt. That there is no ſtatute exiſting, by which that ſpecific diſability which we ſpeak of is created. If there be, let it be produced. The argument will then be at an end.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. That there is no precedent, in all the proceedings of the Houſe of Commons, which comes entirely home to the preſent caſe, viz. <q>where an expelled member has been <g ref="char:startq">“</g>returned again, and another candidate, with an inferior
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:023477_0070_0FBFB52AB68FD1B8"/>
                     <g ref="char:endq">”</g>number of votes, has been declared the sitting member.</q> If there be ſuch a precedent, let it be given to us plainly, and I am ſure it will have more weight than all the cunning arguments which have been drawn from inferences and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities.</p>
               <p>The miniſtry, in that laborious pamphlet which I preſume contains the whole ſtrength of the party, have declared<note n="*" place="bottom">Caſe of the Middleſex election conſidered, <hi>page 38.</hi>
                  </note>, <q>
                     <g ref="char:startq">“</g>that Mr. Walpole's was the firſt and only inſtance in which the electors of any county or borough had returned a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <g ref="char:endq">”</g>expelled to ſerve in the ſame Parliament.</q> It is not poſſible to conceive a caſe mere exactly in point. Mr. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole was expelled; and, having a majority of votes at the next election, was returned again. The friends of Mr. Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, a candidate ſet up by the miniſtry, petitioned the houſe that he might be the sitting member. Thus far the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances tally exactly, except that our Houſe of Commons ſaved Mr. Luttrell the trouble of petitioning. The point of law, however, was ſame. It came regularly before the houſe, and it was their buſineſs to determine upon it. They did determine it, for they declared Mr. Taylor <hi>not du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly elected.</hi> If it be ſaid that they meant this reſolution as matter of favour and indulgence to the borough, which had retorted Mr. Walpole upon them, in order that the burgeſſes, knowing what the law was, might correct their error; I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">I. That it is a ſtrange way of arguing, to oppoſe a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which no man can prove, to a fact which proves itſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">II. That if this were the intention of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, it muſt have defeated itſelf. The burgeſſes of Lynn could never have known their error, much leſs could they have corrected it by any inſtruction they received from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Houſe of Commons. They might perhaps have foreſeen, that, if they returned Mr. Walpole again, he would again be rejected; but they never could infer, from a reſolution by which the candidate with the feweſt votes was declared <hi>not duly elected,</hi> that, at a future election, and in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar circumſtances, the Houſe of Commons would reverſe their reſolution, and receive the ſame candidate as duly elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whom they had before rejected.</p>
               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:023477_0071_0FBFB52BCE43D330"/>
               <p>This indeed would have been a moſt extraordinary way of declaring the law of parliament, and what I preſume no man, whoſe underſtanding is not at croſs-purpoſes with itſelf, could poſſibly underſtand.</p>
               <p>If, in a caſe of this importance, I thought myſelf at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to argue from ſuppoſitions rather than from facts, I think the probability, in this inſtance, is directly the reverſe of what the miniſtry affirm; and that it is much more likely that the Houſe of Commons at that time would rather have ſtrained a point in favour of Mr. Taylor, than that they would have violated the law of parliament, and robbed Mr. Taylor of a right legally veſted in him, to gratify a refrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory borough, which, in defiance of them. had returned a perſon branded with the ſtrongeſt mark of the diſpleaſure of the houſe.</p>
               <p>But really, Sir, this way of talking, for I cannot call it argument, is a mockery of the common underſtanding of the nation, too groſs to be endured. Our deareſt intereſts are at ſtake. An attempt had been made, not merely to rob a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle county of its rights, but, by inevitable conſequence, to alter the conſtitution of the Houſe of Commons. This fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal attempt has ſucceeded, and ſtands as a precedent record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ever. If the miniſtry are unable to defend their cauſe by fair argument founded on facts, let them ſpare us at leaſt the mortification of being amuſed and deluded like children. I believe there is yet a ſpirit of reſiſtance in this country, which will not ſubmit to be oppreſſed; but I am ſure there is a fond of good ſenſe in this country, which cannot be deceived.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  <date>AUGUST 1, 1769.</date>
               </opener>
               <p>IT will not be neceſſary for <hi>Junius</hi> to take the trouble of anſwering your correſpondent G. A. the quotation from a ſpeech without doors, publiſhed in your paper of the 28th of laſt month. The ſpeech appeared before <hi>Junius</hi>'s letter; and as the author ſeems to conſider the great propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:023477_0072_0FBFB52D22B0CC60"/>on which all his argument depends, viz, <hi>that Mr. Wilkis was under that known legal incapacity of which Junius ſpeaks,</hi> as a point granted, his ſpeech is in no ſhape an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>Junius,</hi> for this is the very queſtion in debate.</p>
               <p>As to G. A. l obſerve, firſt, that if he did not admit <hi>Junius</hi>'s ſtate of the queſtion, be ſhould have ſhown the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy of it, or given us a more exact one;—ſecondly, that, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the many hours and days which the miniſtry and their advocates have waſted, in public debate, in compiling large quartus, and collecting innumerable precedents, expreſsly to prove that the late proceedings of the Houſe of Commons are warranted by the law, cuſtom, and practice of Parliament, it is rather an extraordinary ſuppoſition, to be made by one of their own party even for the ſake of argument, <hi>that no ſuch ſtatute, us ſuch cuſtom of Parliament, no ſuch caſe in p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>int, can be produced.</hi> G. A. may however make the ſuppoſition with ſafety. It contains nothing, but literally the fact, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that there is a caſe exactly in point, with a deciſion of the houſe diametrically oppoſite to that which the preſent Houſe of Commons came to in favour of Mr. Luttrell.</p>
               <p>The miniſtry now begin to be aſhamed of the weakneſs of their cauſe; and, as it uſually happens with falſehood, are driven to the neceſſity of ſhifting their ground, and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their whole defence. At firſt we were told, that nothing could be clearer than that the proceedings of the Houſe of Commons were juſtified by the known law and uniform cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of Parliament. But now it ſeems, if there be no law, the Houſe of Commons have a right to make one; and if there be no precedent, they have a right to create the firſt:— for this I preſume is the amount of the queſtions propoſed to <hi>Junius.</hi> if your correſpondent had been at all verſed in the law of Parliament, or generally in the laws of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he would have ſeen that this defence is as weak and falſe as the former.</p>
               <p>The privileges of either houſe of Parliament, it is true, are indefinite. that is, they have not been deſcribed or laid down in any one code or declaration whatſoever; but whenever a queſtion of privilege has ariſen, it has invariably been diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or maintained upon the footing of precedents alone<note n="*" place="bottom">This is ſtill meeting the miniſtry upon their own ground; for, in truth, no precedents will ſupport either natural injuſtice, or violation of poſitive right.</note>.

               <p>Your next inſinuation that Sir william Meredith had haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adopted the falſe gloſſes of his new ally, is of the ſame ſort with the firſt. It conveys a ſneer as little worthy of the gravity of your character, as it is uſeleſs to your defence. It is of little moment to the public to inquire, by whom the charge was conceived, or by whom it was adopted. The only queſtion we aſk, is, Whether or no it be true? The remainder of your reflections upon Mr. Grenville's conduct deſtroy themſelves. He could not poſſibly come prepared to traduce your integrity to the houſe. He could not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> that you would even ſpeak upon the queſtion; much leſs would he foreſee that you could maintain a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of that doctrine which you had ſolemnly, diſintereſtedly, and upon ſobereſt reflection, delivered to the public. He came armed indeed with what he thought a reſpectable authority, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port what he was convinced was the cauſe of truth; and I
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:023477_0076_0FBFB53D9FE47D60"/>doubt not he intended to give you, in the courſe of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and honourable and public teſtimony of his eſteem. Thinking highly of his abilities, I cannot however allow him the gift of divination. As to what you are pleaſed to call a plan coolly formed to impoſe upon the Houſe of Commons, and his producing it without provocation at midnight, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fider it as the language of pique and invective: therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of regard. But, Sir, I am ſenſible I have followed your example too long, and wandered from the point.</p>
               <p>The quotation from your commentaries is matter of record. It can neither be <hi>altered</hi> by your friends, nor miſrepreſented by your enemies; and I am willing to take your own word for what you have ſaid in the Houſe of Commons. If there be a real difference between what you have written and what you have ſpoken, you confeſs that your book ought to be the ſtandard. Now, Sir, if words mean any thing, I apprehend, that, when a long enumeration of diſqualifications (whether by ſtatute of the cuſtom of parliament) concludes with theſe general comprehenſive words, <q>But, ſubject to theſe reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions <g ref="char:startq">“</g>and diſqualifications, <hi>every</hi> ſubject of the realm is <g ref="char:endq">”</g>eligible of common right,</q> a reader of plain underſtanding muſt of courſe reſt ſatisfied that no ſpecies of diſqualification whatſoever had been omitted. The known character of the author, and the apparent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>uracy with which the whole work is compiled, would confirm him in his opinion; nor could he poſſibly form any other judgment, without looking upon your commentaries in the ſame light in which you conſider thoſe penal laws which. though not repealed, are fallen into diſuſe, and are now in effect A SXARE TO THE UNWARY<note n="*" place="bottom">If, in ſtating the law upon any point, a judge deliberately affirms that he has included every caſe, and it ſhould appear that he has purpoſely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a material caſe, he does in effect lay a ſnare for the unwary.</note>.</p>
               <p>You tell us indeed, that it was not part of your plan to ſpecify any temporary incapacity: and that you could not. without a ſpirit of prophecy, have ſpecified the diſability of a private individual, ſubſequent to the period at which you wrote. What your plan was, I know not; but what it ſhould have been, in order to complete the work you have given us, is by no means difficult to determine. The incapacity, which you call temporary, may continue ſeven years; and though you might not have foreſeen the particular caſe of Mr. Wilkes. you might and ſhould have foreſeen the poſſibility of <hi>ſuch</hi> a
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:023477_0077_0FBFB5426F39EB88"/>caſe, and told us how far the Houſe of Commons were au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed to proceed in it by the law and cuſtom of Parliamen. The freeholders of Middleſex would then have known what they had to truſt to, and would never have returned Mr. Wilkes, when Colonel Luttrell was a candidate againſt him, They would have choſen ſome indifferent perſon, rather than ſubmit to be repreſented by the object of their contempt and deteſtation.</p>
               <p>Your attempt to diſtinguiſh between diſabilities which as, fect whole claſſes of men, and thoſe which affect individuals only, is really unworthy of your underſtanding, Your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries had taught me, that, although the inſtance in which a penal law is exerted be particular, the laws themſelves are general. They are made for the benefit and inſtruction of the public, though the penalty falls only upon and individual. You cannot but know, Sir, what was Mr. Wilkes's caſe yeſterday, may be yours or mine to-morrow, and that conſequently the common right of every ſubject of the realm is invaded by it. Profeſſing therefore to treat of the conſtitution of the Houſe of Commons, and of the laws and cuſtoms relative to that conſtitution, you certainly were guilty of a moſt unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able omiſſion in taking no notice of a right and privilege of the houſe, more extraordinary and more arbitrary than all the others they poſſeſs put together. If the expulſion of a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, not under any legal diſbility, of itſelf creates in him an incapacity to be elected, I ſee a ready way marked out, by which the majority may at any time remove the honeſteſt and ableſt men who happen to be in oppoſition to them. To ſay that they <hi>will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> make this extravagant uſe of their power, would be a language unfit for a man for learned in the laws as you are. Bu your doctrine, Sir, they <hi>have</hi> the power, and laws, you know, are intended to guard againſt what men <hi>may</hi> do, not to truſt to what they <hi>will</hi> do.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, Sir, the charge againſt you is of a plain, ſimple nature: It appears even upon the face of your own pamphlet. On the contrary, you juſtifications of yourſelf is full of ſubtlety and refinement, and in ſome places not very intelligible. If I were perſonally your enemy, I ſhould dwell, with a malignant pleaſure, upon thoſe great and uſeful qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications which you certainly poſſeſs, and by which you once acquired, though they could not preſerve to you, the reſpect and eſteem of your country. I ſhould enumerate the honours

               <p>A CORRESPONDENT of the St. James's Evening-Poſt firſt wilfully miſunderſtands Junius, then cenſures him for a bad reaſoner. Junius does not ſay that it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon Doctor Blackſtone to foreſee and ſtate the crimes for which Mr. Wilkes was expelled. If, by a ſpirit of prophecy, he had even done ſo, it would have been nothing to the purpoſe. The queſtion is, not for what particular of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences a perſon may be expelled, but generally whether by the law of Parliament expulſion alone creates a diſqualification. If the affirmative be the law of Parliament, Doctor Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone might and ſhould have told us ſo. The queſtion is not confined to this or that particular perſon, but forms one great general branch of diſqualification, too important in itſelf, and too extenſive in its conſequences, to be omitted in an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate work expreſsly treating of the law of Parliament.</p>
               <p>The truth of the matter is evidently this. Dr. Blackſtone, while he was ſpeaking in the Houſe of Commons, never once <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>Waving for the preſent any objection I may have to this ſtate of the queſtion, I ſhall venture to meet our champion upon his own ground; and attempt to ſupport the affirmative of it, in one of the two ways by which he ſays it can be alone fairly ſupported. <q>If there be no ſtatute (ſays he) in which <g ref="char:startq">“</g>the ſpecific diſability is clearly created, &amp;c. (and we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge there is none), the cuſtom of Parliament muſt then be referred to, and ſome caſe, or caſes, ſtrictly in point, muſt be produced, with the deciſion of the court <g ref="char:endq">”</g>upon them.</q> Now I aſſert, that this has been done. Mr. Walpole's caſe is ſtrictly in point, to prove that expulſion creates abſolute incapacity of being re-elected. This was the clear deciſion of the houſe upon it; and was a full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, that incapacity was the neceſſary conſequence of
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:023477_0080_0FBFB54B1F7EAEE0"/>expulſion. The law was as clearly and firmly fixed by this neſolution, and is as binding in every ſubſequent caſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion, as if it had been declared by an expreſs ſtatute. <q>
                     <g ref="char:startq">“</g>that a member expelled by a reſolution of the Houſe of <g ref="char:endq">”</g>Commons ſhall be deemed incapable of being re-elected.</q> Whatever doubt then there might have been of the law before Mr. Walpole's caſe, with reſpect to the full operation of a vote of expulſion, there can be none now. The deciſion of the houſe upon this caſe is ſtrictly in point, to prove that expulſion creates abſolute incapacity in law of being re-elected.</p>
               <p>But incapacity in law, in this inſtance, muſt have the ſame operation and effect with incapacity in law in every other inſtance. Now, incapacity of being re-elected implies in its very terms, that my votes given to the incapable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, at a ſubſequent election, are null and void. This is its neceſſary operation, or it has no operation at all: It is <hi>

               <p>Laſtly, it is, in all caſes of election, the known and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed law of the land, grounded upon the cleareſt principles of reaſon and common ſenſe, that if the votes given to one candidate are null and void, they cannot be oppoſed to the votes given to anoth4r candidate: They cannot affect the votes of ſuch candidate at all. As they have on the one hand no poſitive quality to add or eſtabliſh, ſo they have on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand no negative one to ſubtractor deſtroy. They are, in a word, a mere nonentity. Such was the determination of the Houſe of Commons in the Malden and Bedford elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; caſes ſtrictly in point to the preſent queſtion, as far as they are meant to be in point. And to ſay, that they are not in point in all circumſtances, in thoſe particularly which are independent of the propoſition which they are quoted to prove, is to ſay no more than that Malden is not Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex, nor Serjeant Comyns Mr. Wilkes.</p>
               <p>Let us ſee then how our proof ſtands. Expulſion creates incapacity; incapacity annihilates any votes given to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable perſon; the votes given to the qualified candidate, ſtand upon their own bottom, firm and untouched, and can alone have effect. This, one would think, would be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent.

               </p>
               <p>I ſhall now therefore beg leave to make a ſlight amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to lunius's ſtate of the queſtion, the affirmative of which will then ſtand thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <g ref="char:startq">“</g>It is the known and eſtabliſhed law of Parliament, that the expulſion of any member of the Houſe of Commons, creates in him an incapacity of being re-elected; that any

Mr. Walpole was expelled; and, having a majority of votes at the next election, was returned again.

                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>Inſtead of examining the juſtneſs of this repreſentation. I ſhall beg leave to oppoſe againſt it my own view of this caſe, in as plain a manner and as few words as I am able.</p>
               <p>It was the known and eſtabliſhed law of Parliament, when the charge againſt Mr. Walpole came before the Houſe of Commons, that they had power to expel, to diſable, and to render incapable for offences. In virtue of this power, they expelled him.</p>
               <p>Had they, in the very vote of expulſion, adjudged him, in terms, to be incapable of being re-elected, there muſt have been at once an end with him. But though the right of the houſe, both to expel, and adjudge incapable, was clear and indubitable, it does not appear to me, that the full opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and effect of a vote of expulſion, ſingly, was ſo. The law in this caſe had never been expreſsly declared. There had been no event to call up ſuch a declaration. I trouble not myſelf with the grammatical meaning of the word ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion: I regard only its legal meaning. This was not, as I think, preciſely fixed. The houſe thought proper to fix it, and explicitly to declare the full conſequences of their former vote, before they ſuffered theſe conſequences to take effect. And in this proceeding they acted upon the moſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral and ſolid principles of equity, juſtice, and law. What then did the burgeſſes of Lynn collect from the ſecond vote?
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:023477_0083_0FBFB5576E3FA150"/>Their ſubſequent conduct will tell us: it will with certainty tell us, that they conſidered it as deciſive againſt Mr. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole; it will alſo, with equal certainty, tell us, that, upon ſuppoſition that the law of election ſtood then, as it does now, and that they know it to ſtand thus, they inferred, <q>
                     <g ref="char:startq">“</g>that at a future election, and in caſe of a ſimilar return, the houſe would receive the ſame candidate, as duly elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <g ref="char:endq">”</g>whom they had before rejected.</q> They could infer nothing but this.</p>
               <p>It is needleſs to repeat the circumſtance of diſſimilarity in the preſent caſe. It will be ſufficient to obſerve, that as the law of Parliament, upon which the Houſe of Commons grounded every ſtep of their proceedings, was clear beyond the reach of doubt, ſo neither could the freeholders of Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex be at a loſs to foreſee what muſt be the inevitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of their proceedings in oppoſition to it. For upon every return of Mr. Wilkes, the houſe made inquiry whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any votes were given to any other candidate.</p>

It will only prove, that the law of election at that time was different from the preſent law. It will prove, that, in all caſes of an incapable candidate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, the law then was, that the whole election ſhould be void. But now we know that this is not law. The caſes of Malden and Bedford were, as has been ſeen, determined upon other and more juſt principles. And theſe determinations are, I imaging, admitted on all ſides to be law.</p>
               <p>I would willingly draw a veil over the remaining part of this paper. It is aſtoniſhing, it is painful, to ſee men of parts and ability, giving into the moſt unworthy artifices, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending ſo much below their true line of character. But if they are not the dupes of their ſophiſtry (which is hardly to be conceived,) let them conſider that they are ſomething much worſe.</p>
               <p>The deareſt intereſts of this country are its laws and its conſtitution. Againſt every attack upon theſe, there will, I hope, be always found amongſt us the firmeſt <hi>ſpirit of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;</hi> ſuperior to the united efforts of faction and ambition.

               <p>THE gentleman who has publiſhed an anſwer to Sir William Meredith's pamphlet, having honoured me with a poſtſcript of ſix quarto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which he moderately calls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing a <hi>very</hi> few words upon me, I cannot, in common politeneſs, refuſe him a reply. The form and magnitude of a quarto impoſes upon the mind; and men, who are unequal to the labour of diſcuſſing an intricate argument, or wiſh to avoid it, are willing enough to ſuppoſe, that much has been proved, becauſe much has been ſaid. Mine, I confeſs, are humble labours. I do not preſume to inſtruct the learned, but ſimply to inform the body of the people; and I prefer that channel of conveyance, which is likely to ſpread far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt among them. The advocates of the miniſtry ſeem to me to write for fame, and to flatter themſelves, that the ſize of their works will make them immortal. They pile up re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctant quarto upon ſolid folio, as if their labours, becauſe they were gigantic, could contend with truth and Heaven.</p>
               <p>The writer of the volume in queſtion, meets me upon my own ground. He acknowledges there is no ſtatute, by which the ſpecific diſability we ſpeak of is created; but he affirms, that the cuſtom of Parliament has been referred to; and that a caſe ſtrictly in point has been produced, with the deciſion of the court upon it.—I thank him for coming ſo fairly to the point. He aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>rts, that the cauſe of Mr. Walpole is ſtrictly in point, to prove that expulſion creates an abſolute incapacity of being re-elected; and for this purpoſe he refers generally to the firſt vote of the houſe upon that occaſion, without venturing to recite the vote itſelf. The unfair, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingenuous
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:023477_0085_0FBFB55B72BD5D58"/>artifice of adopting that part of a precedent which ſeems to ſuit his purpoſe, and omitting the remainder, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves ſome pity, but cannot excite my reſentment. He takes advantage eagerly of the firſt reſolution, by which Mr. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole's incapacity is declared; but as to the two following, by which the candidate with the feweſt votes was declared "not duly elected," and the election itſelf vacated, I d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

In fair ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, no part of a precedent ſhould be admitted, unleſs the whole of it be given to us together. The author has divided his precedent; for he knew, that, taken together, it produced a conſequence directly the reverſe of that which he endeavours to draw from a vote of expulſion. But what will this honeſt perſon ſay, if I take him at his word, and demonſtrate to him, that the Houſe of Commons never meant to found Mr. Walpole's incapacity upon h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Let it be remembered that we are ſpeaking of the intention of men who lived more than half a century ago, and that ſuch intention can only he collected from their words and actions as they are delivered to us upon record.

                           <p>If Junius's conſtruction of the vote againſt Mr. Walpole be now admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (and indeed I cannot comprehend how it can honeſtly be diſputed) the advocates of the Houſe of Commons muſt either give up their precedent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, or be reduced to the neceſſity of maintaining one of the groſſeſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities imaginable, viz. <q>That a commitment to the Tower is a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuent <g ref="char:startq">“</g>part of, and contributes half at leaſt to, the incapacitation of the <g ref="char:endq">”</g>perſon who ſuffers it.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>I need not make you any excuſe for endeavouring to keep alive the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the public to the deciſion of the Middleſex election. The more I conſider it, the more I am convinced, that, as a <hi>fact,</hi> it is indeed highly injurious to the rights of the people; but that, as a <hi>precedent,</hi> it is one of the moſt dangerous that ever was eſtabliſhed againſt thoſe who are to come after us. Yet I am ſo far a moderate man, that I verily believe the majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Houſe of Commons, when they paſſed this dangerous vote, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther underſtood the queſtion, nor knew the conſequence of what they were doing. Their motives were rather deſpicable, than criminal, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme. One effect they certainly did not foreſee. They are now reduced to ſuch a ſituation, that if a member of the preſent Houſe of Commons were to conduct himſelf ever ſo improperly, and in reality deſerve to be ſent back to his conſtituents with a mark of diſgrace, they would not dare to expel him; becauſe they know that the people, in order to try again the great queſtion of right, or to thwart an odious Houſe of Commons, would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly overlook his immediate unworthineſs, and return the ſame perſon to Parliament.—But, in time, the precedent will gain ſtrength. A future Houſe of Commons will have no ſuch apprehenſions; conſequently will not ſcruple to follow a precedent which they did not eſtabliſh. The miſer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſeldom lives to enjoy the fruit of his extortion; but his heir ſucceeds him of courſe, and takes poſſeſſion without cenſure. No man expects him to make reſtitution; and no matter for his title, he lives quietly upon the eſtate.</p>

               <p>I do not mean to give an opinion upon the juſtice of the proceedings of the Houſe of Commons with regard to Mr. Walpole: but certainly, if I admitted their cenſure to be well-founded, I could no way avoid agreeing with them in the conſequence they drew from it. I could never have a doubt in law or reaſon, that a man convicted of a high breach of truſt, and of notorious corruption in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:023477_0088_0FBFB56103641290"/>of a public office, was and ought to be incapable of ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the ſame Parliament. Far from attempting to inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate that vote, I ſhould have wiſhed that the incapacity declared by it could legally have been continued for ever.</p>
               <p>Now, Sir, obſerve how forcibly the argament returns. The Houſe of Commons, upon the face of their proceedings, had the ſtrongeſt motives to declare Mr. Walpole incapable of being re-elected. They thought ſuch a man unworthy to fit among them. To that point they proceeded, and no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for they reſpected the rights of the people, while they aſſerted their own. They did not infer, from Mr. Walpole's incapacity, that his opponent was duly elected; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they declared Mr. Taylor "Not duly elected," and the election itſelf void.</p>
               <p>Such, however, is the precedent which my honeſt friend aſſures us is ſtrictly in point to prove, that expulſion of itſelf creates an incapacity of being elected. If it had been ſo, the preſent Houſe of Commons ſhould at leaſt have followed ſtrictly the example before them, and ſhould have ſtated to us in the ſame vote the crimes for which they expelled Mr. Wilkes; whereas they reſolve ſimply, that, <q>having been expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>
                     <g ref="char:endq">”</g>he was, and is incapable.</q> In this proceeding I am au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed to affirm, they have neither ſtatute, nor cuſtom, nor reaſon, nor one ſingle precedent to ſupport them. On the other ſide, there is indeed a precedent ſo ſtrongly in point, that all the enchanted caſtles of miniſterial magic fall before it. In the year 1698 (a period which the rankeſt Tory dare not except againſt,) Mr. Wollaſton was expelled, re-elected, and admitted to take his ſeat in the ſame Parliament. The miniſtry have precluded themſelves from all objections drawn from the cauſe of his expulſion; for they affirm abſolutely, that expulſion of itſelf creates the diſability. Now, Sir, let ſophiſtry evade, let falſehood aſſert, and impudence deny—here ſtands the precedent, a land-mark to direct us through a troubled ſea of controverſy, conſpicuous and unremoved.</p>
               <p>I have dwelt the longer upon the diſcuſſion of this point, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, in <hi>my</hi> opinion, it comprehends the whole queſtion. The reſt is unworthy of notice. We are inquiring whether incapacity be or be not created by expulſion. In the caſes of Bedford and Malden, the incapacity of the perſons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned was matter of public notoriety, for it was created by act of Parliament. But really, Sir, my honeſt friend's ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:023477_0089_0FBFB5694620A250"/>are as unfavourable to him as his facts. He well knows that the clergy, beſides that they are repreſented in common with their follow-ſubjects, have alſo a ſeparate Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of their own:—that their incapacity to fit in the Houſe of Commons has been confirmed by repeated deciſions of the houſe; and that the law of Parliament, declared by theſe deciſions, has been for above two centuries notorious and undiſputed. The author is certainly at liberty to fancy caſes, and make whatever compariſons <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e thinks proper: has ſuppoſitions ſtill continue as diſtant from fact, as his will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes are from ſolid argument.</p>
               <p>The concluſion of his book is candid to extreme. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to grant me all I deſire. He thinks he may ſafely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that the caſe of Mr. Walpole makes directly againſt him, for it ſeems he has one grand ſolution <hi>in petts</hi> for all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <hi>If,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>This indeed is more than I expected. The principle, I know, has been maintained in fact; but I never expected to ſee it ſo formally declared. What can he mean? Does he aſſume this language to ſatisfy the doubts of the people; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> does he mean to rouſe their indignation? Are the miniſtry daring enough to affirm, that the Houſe of Commons have a right to make and unmake the law of Parliament at their pleaſure? Does the law of Parliament, which we are ſo often told is the law of the land;—does the common right of every ſubject of the realm, depend upon an arbitrary ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricious vote of one branch of the legiſlature?—The voice of truth and reaſon muſt be ſilent.</p>
               <p>The miniſtry tell us plainly, that this is no longer a queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of right, but of power and force alone. What was law yeſterday is not law to-day: and now it ſeems we have no better rule to live by, than the temporary diſcretion and fluctuating integrity of the Houſe of Commons.</p>
               <p>Profeſſions of patriotiſm are become ſtale and ridiculous. For my own part, I claim no merit from endeavouring to do a ſervice to my fellow-ſubjects. I have done it to the beſt of my underſtanding; and without looking for the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of other men, my conſcience is ſatisfied. What re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be done concerns the collective body of the people. They are now to determine for themſelves, whether they
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:023477_0090_0FBFB56CACC6B520"/>will firmly and conſtitutionally aſſert their rights; or make an humble, ſlaviſh ſurrender of them at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>et of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry. To a generous mind there cannot be a doubt. We one it to our anceſtors to preſerve entire thoſe rights which they have delivered to our care: we owe it to our poſterity, not to ſuffer their deareſt inheritance to be deſtroyed. But if it were poſſible for us to be inſenſible of theſe ſacred claims, there is yet an obligation binding upon ourſelves, from which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can acquit us;—a perſonal intere<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t, which we cannot ſurrender. To alienate even our own rights, would be a crime as much more enormous than ſuicide, as a life of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſecurity and freedom is ſuperior to exiſtence; and if life be the bounty of Heaven, we ſcornfully reject the nobleſt part of the gift, if we conſent to ſurrender that certain rule of living, without which the condition of human nature is not only miſerable, but contemptible.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>

               </opener>
               <p>I MUST beg of you to print a few lines, in explanation of ſome paſſages in my laſt letter, which I ſee have been miſunderſtood.</p>
               <p n="1">1. When I ſaid, that the Houſe of Commons never meant to found Mr. Walpole's incapacity on his expulſion <hi>only,</hi> I meant no more than to deny the general propoſition, that expulſion <hi>alone</hi> creates the incapacity. If there be any thing ambiguous in the expreſſion, I beg leave to explain it by ſaying, that, in my opinion, expulſion neither creates, nor in any part contributes to create the incapacity in queſtion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I carefully avoided entering into the merits of Mr. Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole's caſe. I did not inquire, whether the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons acted juſtly, or whether they truly declared the law of Parliament. My remarks went only to their apparent mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and intention, as it ſtands declared in their own reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I never meant to affirm, that a commitment to the Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er created a diſqualification. On the contrary, I conſidered
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:023477_0091_0FBFB56DAEE2F1E8"/>that idea as abſurdity, into which the miniſtry muſt ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitably fall, if they reaſoned right upon their own principles.</p>
               <p>The caſe of Mr. Wollaſton ſpeaks for itſelf. The miniſtry aſſert that <hi>expulſion alone</hi> creates an abſolute complete incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to be re-elected to fit in the ſame Parliament. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition they have uniformely maintained, without any condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or modification whatſoever. Mr. Wollaſton was expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, re-elected, and admitted to take his ſeat in the ſame Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. —I leave it to the public to determine, whether this be a plain matter of fact, or mere nonſenſe or declamation.</p>

               <p>ARGUMENT againſt FACT; or A new ſyſtem of political Logic, by which the miniſtry have demonſtrated, to the ſatisfaction of their friends, that expulſion alone creates a complete incapacity to be re-elected; <hi>alias,</hi> that a ſubject of this realm may be robbed of his common right by a vote of the Houſe of Commons.</p>

                  <p>As this cannot conveniently be reconciled with our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral propoſition, it may be neceſſary to ſhift our ground, and look back to the <hi>cauſe</hi> of Mr. Wollaſton's expulſion. From thence it will appear clearly, that, <q>although he was expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>he had not rendered himſelf a culprit too ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to ſit in Parliament; and that, having reſigned his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, <g ref="char:endq">”</g>he was no longer incapacitated by law.</q>

                  <p>From the terms of this vote, nothing can be more evident, than that the Houſe of Commons meant to fix the incapacity upon the paniſhment, and not upon the crime. But, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <head>ARGUMENT.</head>
                  <p>This fact we conſider as directly in point to prove that Mr. Luttrell ought to be the ſitting member, for the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaſons: <q>The burgeſſes of Lynn could draw no other <g ref="char:startq">“</g>inference from this reſolution, but this, that at a future
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:023477_0093_0FBFB570A120C620"/>election, and in caſe of a ſimilar return, the houſe would receive the ſame candidate as duly elected, whom they had <g ref="char:endq">”</g>before rejected.</q> 
                     <hi>Vide Poſtſcript to Junius,</hi> page 37. Or thus: <q>This their reſolution leaves no room to doubt what <g ref="char:startq">“</g>part they <hi>would</hi> have taken, if, upon a ſubſequent re-elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mr. Walpole, there had been any other candidate in competition with him.

                     <hi>Vide Mungo's caſe conſidered,</hi> page 39. Or take it in this light:—The burgeſſes of Lynn having, in defiance of the houſe, retorted upon them a perſon, whom they had brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the moſt ignominious marks of their diſpleaſure, were thereby ſo well entitled to favour and indulgence, that the houſe could do no leſs that rob Mr. Taylor of a right legally veſted in him, in order that the burgeſſes might be appriſed of the law of Parliament; which law the houſe took a very direct way of explaining to them, by reſoving that the can lidate with the feweſt votes was not duly elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: —<q>And was not this much more equitable, more in the <g ref="char:startq">“</g>ſpirit of that equal and ſubſtantial juſtice, which is the end of all law, than if they had violently adhered to the ſtrict <g ref="char:endq">”</g>maxims of law?</q>

                  <p>Permit me now, Sir, to ſhew you, that the worthy Dr. Blackſtone ſometimes contradicts the miniſtry as well as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The ſpeech without doors aſſerts, page 9. <q>That the <g ref="char:startq">“</g>legal effect of an incapacity, founded on a judicial deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of a complete court, is preciſely the ſame as <g ref="char:endq">”</g>that of an incapacity created by act of Parliament.</q> Now for the Doctor.—<hi>The law and the opinion of the judge are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways convertible terms, or and the ſame thing; ſince it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times may happen that the judge may miſtake the law.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries, Vol. I. page 71.</p>

                  <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
                  <date>SEPTEMBER 19, 1769.</date>
               </opener>
               <p>YOU are ſo little accuſtomed to receive any marks of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect or eſteem from the public, that if, in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lines, a compliment or expreſſion of applauſe ſhould eſcape me. I fear you would conſider it as a mockery of your eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed character, and perhaps and inſult to your underſtanding. You have nice feelings, my Lord, if we may judge from your reſentments. Cautious, therefore, of giving offence, where you have ſo little deſerved it, I ſhall leave the illuſtration of your virtues to other hands. Your friends have a privilege to play upon the eaſineſs of your temper, or poſſible they are better acquainted with your good qualities than I am. You have done good by ſtealth. The reſt is upon record. You have ſtill left ample room for ſpeculation, when panegyric is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted.</p>
               <p>You are indeed a very conſiderable man. The higheſt rank;—a ſplendid fortune;—and a name, glorious till it was your's,—were ſufficient to have ſupported you with meaner abilities than I think you poſſeſs. From the firſt, you derive a conſtitutional claim to reſpect; from the ſecond, a natural extenſive authority;—the laſt created a partial expectation of hereditary virtues. The uſe you have made of theſe uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon advantages might have been more honourable to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but could not be more inſtructive to mankind. We may
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:023477_0095_0FBFB579DEF15360"/>trace it in teh veneration of your country, the choice of your friends, and in the accompliſhment of every ſanguine hope which the public mgith have conceived from the illuſtrious name of Ruſſell.</p>
               <p>The eminence of your ſtation gave you a commanding pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of your duty. The road, which led to honour, was open to your view. You could not loſe it by miſtake, and you had no temptation to depart from it by deſign. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the natural dignity and importance of the richeſt peer of England;—the nobleſt independence which he might have maintained in Parliament, and the real intereſt and reſpect which he might have acquired, not only in Parliament, but through the whole kingdom:—compare theſe glorious diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the ambitions of holding a ſhare in government, the emoluments of a place, the ſale of a borough, or the purchaſe of a corporation; and though you may not regret the virtues which create reſpect, you may ſee with anguiſh how much real importance and authority you have loſt. Conſider the character of an independent virtuous Duke of Bedford; ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what he might be in this country—then reflect one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon what you are. If it be poſſible for me to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw my attention from the fact, I will tell you in the theory what ſuch a man might be.</p>
               <p>Conſcious of his own weight and importance, his conduct in Parliament would be directed by nothing but the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional duty of a peer. He would conſider himſelf as a guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian of the laws. Willing to ſupport the juſt meaſures of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, but determined to obſerve the conduct of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter with ſuſpicion, he would oppoſe the violence of faction with as much firmneſs as the encroachments of prerogative. He would be as little capable of bargaining with the miniſter for places for himſelf or his dependants, as of deſcending to mix himſelf in the intrigues of oppoſition. Whenever an important queſtion called for his opinion in Parliament, he would be heard, by the moſt profligate miniſter, with defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and reſpect. His authority would either ſanctify or diſgrace the meaſures of government.—The people would look up to him as their protector; and a virtuous prince would have one honeſt man in his dominions, in whoſe inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and judgment he might ſafely confide. If it ſhould be he will of Providence to afflict him with a domeſtic misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,<note n="*" place="bottom">The Duke lately loſt his only ſon, by a fall from his horſe.</note>
                  <pb n="93" facs="unknown:023477_0096_0FBFB58040382700"/>he would ſubmit to the ſtroke with feeling, but not without dignity. He would conſider the people as his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and receive a generous heart-felt conſolation in the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathiſing tears and bleſſings of his country.</p>
               <p>Your Grace may probably diſcover ſomething more intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible in the negative part of this illuſtrious character. The man I have deſcribed would never proſtitute his dignity in Parliament by an indecent violence, either in oppoſing or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſending a miniſter. He would not at one moment rancorouſly perſecute, at another baſely cringe to the favourite of his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign. After outraging the royal dignity with peremptory conditions little ſhort of menace and hoſtility, he would never deſcend to the humility of ſoliciting an interview<note n="†" place="bottom">At this interview, which paſſed at the houſe of the late Lord Eglin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toun. Lord Bute told the Duke that he was determined never to have any connection with a man who had ſo baſely betrayed him.</note> with the favourite, and of offering to recover at any price the honour of his friendſhip. Though deceived perhaps in his youth, he would not, through the courſe of a long life, have invariably choſen his friends from among the moſt profligate of mankind. His own honour would have forbidden him from mixing his private pleaſures or converſation with jockies, gameſters, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers, gladiators, or buffoons. He would then have never felt, much leſs would he have ſubmitted to, the diſhoneſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of engaging in the intereſts and intrigues of his depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants; of ſupplying their vices, or relieving their beggary, at the expence of his country. He would not have betrayed ſuch ignorance, or ſuch contempt, of the conſtitution, as openly to avow, in a court of juſtice, the<note n="‡" place="bottom">In an anſwer in Chancery, in a ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

He would not have thought it conſiſtent with his rank in the ſtate, or even whit his perſonal importance, to be the little tyrant of a little corporation<note n="‖" place="bottom">Of Bedford; where the tyrant was held in ſuch contempt and deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that, in order to deliver themſelves from him, they admitted a great number of ſtrangers to the freedom. To make his defeat truly ridiculous, he tried his whole ſtrength againſt Mr. <hi>Horne;</hi> and was beaten upon his own ground.</note>. He would never have been inſulted with virtues, which he had laboured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh; nor ſuffered the diſgrace of a mortifying defeat,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:023477_0097_0FBFB583544EAF48"/>which has made him ridiculous and contemptible, even to the few by whom he was not deteſted.—I reverecne the afflictions of a good man,—him ſorrows are ſacred. But how can we take part in the diſtreſſes of a man, whom we can neither love nor eſteem; or feel for a calamity, of which he himſelf is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible? Where was the father's heart, when he could look for, or find, an immediate conſolation for the loſs of an only ſon, in conſultations and bargains for a place at court, and even in the miſery of balloting at the India-houſe!</p>
               <p>Admitting then that you have miſtaken or deſerted thoſe honourable principles, which ought to have directed your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; admitting that you have as little claim to private af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as to public eſteem; let us ſee with what abilities, with what degree of judgment, you have carried your own ſyſtem into execution. A great man, in the ſucceſs, and even in the magnitude of his crimes, finds a reſcue from contempt. Your Grace is every way unfortunate. Yet I will not look back to thoſe ridiculous ſcenes by which, in your earlier days, you thought it an honour to be diſtinguiſhed<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Heſton Homphrey, a country Attorney, horſewhipped the Duke, with equal juſtice, ſeverity, and perſeverance, on the Courſe at Litchfield. <hi>Rigby</hi> and Lord <hi>Trentham</hi> were alſo cudgelled in a moſt exemplary manner. This gave riſe to the following ſtory: <q>When the late King heard that Sir <g ref="char:startq">“</g>Edward Hawke had given the Freach a <hi>drubbing,</hi> his Majeſty, who had never received that kind of chaſtiſement, was pleaſed to aſk Lord Cheſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field the meaning of the word,—Sir, ſays Lord Cheſterfield, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the world—but here comes the Duke of Bedford, who is better <g ref="char:startq">“</g>able to explain it to your Majeſty than I am.</q>
                  </note>;—the recorded ſtripes, the public infamy, your own ſufferings, or Mr. Rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by's fortitude. Theſe events undoubtedly left an impreſſion though not upon your mind. To ſuch a mind it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be a pleaſure to reflect, that there is hardly a corner of any of his Majeſty's kingdoms, except France, in which, at one end or another, you valuable life has not been in danger. Amiable man! we ſee and acknowledge the protection of Providence, by which you have ſo often eſcaped the perſonal deteſtation of your fellow-ſubjects, and are ſtill reſerved for the public juſtice of your country.</p>
               <p>Your hiſtory begins to be important at that auſpicious pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod at which you were deputed to repreſent the Earl of Bute at the court of Verſailles. It was an honourable office, and executed with the ſame ſpirit with which it was accepted. Your patrons wanted an ambaſſador, who would ſubmit to
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:023477_0098_0FBFB5842B930398"/>make conceſſions without during to inſiſt upon any honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able condition for his Sovereign. Their buſineſs required a man who had as little feeling for his own dignity, as for the welfare of his country: and they found him in the firſt rank of the nobility. Belleiſle, Goree, Guadaloupe, St. Lucia, Martinique, the Fiſhery, and the Havannah, are glorious monuments of your Grace's talents for negociation. My Lord, we are too well acquainted with your pecuniary character, to think it poſſible that ſo many public ſacrifices ſhould have been made without ſome private compenſations. Your conduct carries with it an internal evidence, beyond all the legal proofs of a court of juſtice. Even the callous pride of Lord Egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont was alarmed<note n="*" place="bottom">This man, notwithſtanding, his pride and Tory principles, had ſome Engliſh ſtuff in him.

               <p>This ſudden declaration of war againſt the favourite might have given you a momentary merit with the public, if it had either been adopted upon principle, or maintained with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. Without looking back to all your former ſervili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we need only obſerve your ſubſequent conduct, to ſee upon what motives you acted. Apparently united with Mr. Grenville, you waited until Lord Rockingham's feeble ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration ſhould diſſolve in its own weaknſs.—The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their diſmiſſion was ſuſpected, the moment you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that another ſyſtem was adopted in the cloſet, you thought it no diſgrace to return to your former dependence, and ſolicit once more the friendſhip of Lord Bute. You beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged an interview, at which he had ſpirit enough to treat you with contempt.</p>
               <p>It would be now of little uſe to point out, by what a train of weak, injudicious meaſures, it became neceſſary, or was thought ſo, to call you back to a ſhare in the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note n="†" place="bottom">When Earl Gower was appointed Preſident of the council, the King with his uſual ſincerity aſſured him, that he l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

We muſt look for other ſtipulations, to account for tha ſudden reſolution of the cloſet, by which three of your dependents<note n="‡" place="bottom">Lords Gower, Weymouth, and Sandwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The poſſeſſion of abſolute power is now once more within your reach. The meaſures you have taken to obtain and confirm it, are too groſs to eſcape the eyes of a diſcerning ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious prince. His palace is beſieged; the lines of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vallation are drawing round him; and unleſs he finds a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource in his own activity, or in the attachment of the real
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:023477_0100_0FBFB58BA43B5460"/>friends of his family, the beſt of princes moſt ſubmit to the confinement of a ſtate-priſoner, until your Grace's death, or ſome leſs fortunate event, ſhall raiſe the ſiege. For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, you man ſafely reſume that ſtyle of inſult and menace, which even a private gentleman cannot ſubmit to bear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being contemptible. Mr. Mackenzie's hiſtory is not yet forgotten; and you may find precedents enough of the mode in which an imperious ſubject man ſignify his pleaſure to his Sovereign. Where will this gracious Monarch look for aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, when the wretched Grafton could forget his obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to his Maſter, and deſert him for a hollow alliance with <hi>ſuch</hi> a man as the Duke of Bedford!</p>
               <p>Let us conſider you, then, as arrived at the ſummit of worldly greatneſs; let us ſuppoſe that all your plans of ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice and ambition are accompliſhed, and your moſt ſanguine wiſhes gratified in the fear as well as the hatred of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Can age itſelf forget that you are in the laſt act of life? Can grey hairs make folly venerable? and is there no period to be reſerved for meditation and retirement? For ſhame my Lord: let it not be recorded of you, that the lateſt moments of your life were dedicated to the ſame unworthy purſuits, the ſame buſy agitations, in which your youth and manhood were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted. Conſider, that although you cannot diſgrace your former life, you are violating the character of age, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the impotent imbecility after you have loſt the vigour of the paſſions.</p>
               <p>Your friends will aſk, perhaps, Whither ſhall this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py old man retire? Can he remain in the metropolis, where his life has been ſo often threatened, and his palace ſo often attacked? If he returns to Wooburn, ſcorn and mockery await him. He muſt create a ſolitude round his eſtate, if he would avoid the face of reproach and deriſion. At Plymouth, his deſtruction would be more than probable; at Exeter, ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable. No honeſt Engliſhman will ever forget his attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor any honeſt Scotchman forgive his treachery, to Lord Bute. At every town he enters, he muſt change his liveries and name. Whichever way he flies, the <hi>Hue and Cry</hi> of the country purſues him.</p>
               <p>In another kingdom, indeed, the bleſſings of his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration have been more ſenſibly felt; his virtues better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; or at worſt they will not, for him alone, forget their hoſpitality.—As well might VERRES have returned to
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:023477_0101_0FBFB58DBB62E180"/>Sicily. You have twice eſcaped, my Lord; beware of a third experiment. The indignation of a whole people, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, inſulted, and oppreſſed as they have been, will not always be diſappointed.</p>
               <p>It is in vain, therefore, to ſhift the ſcene. You can no more fly from your enemies than from yourſelf. Perſecuted abroad, you look into your own heart for conſolation, and find nothing but reproaches and deſpair. But, my Lord, you may quit the field of buſineſs, though not the field of danger; and though you cannot be ſafe, you may ceaſe to be ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous. I fear you have liſtened too long to the advice of thoſe pernicious friends with whoſe intereſts you have ſordidly united your own, and for whom you have ſacrificed every thing that ought to be dear to a man of honour. They are ſtill baſe enough to encourage the follies of your age, as they once did the vices of your youth. As little acquainted with the rules of decorum as with the laws of morality, they will not ſuffer you to profit by experience, nor even to conſult the propriety of a bed character. Even now they tell you, that life is no more than a dramatic ſcene, in which the hero ſhould preſerve his conſiſtency to the laſt; and that as you lived without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>AFTER ſo long an interval, I did not expect to ſee the debate revived between us. My anſwer to your laſt let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſhall be ſhort; for I write to you with reluctance, and I hope we ſhall now conclude our correſpondence for ever.</p>
               <p>Had you been originally and without provocation attacked by an anonymous writer, you would have ſome right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his name. But in this cauſe you are a volunteer. You engaged in it with the unpremeditated gallantry of a ſoldier. You were content to ſet your name in oppoſition to a man who would probably continue in concealment. You under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the terms upon which we were to correſpond and gave at leaſt a tacit aſſent to them. After voluntarily attacking me under the character of Junius, what poſſible right have you to know me under any other? Will you forgive me if I inſinuate to you, that you foreſaw ſome honour in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent ſpirit of coming forward in perſon, and that you were not quite indifferent to the diſplay of your literary qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations?</p>

               <p>You cannot but know, that the republication of my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters was no more than the catchpenny contrivance of a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in which it was impoſſible I ſhould be concerned, and for which I am no way anſwerable.

                  </gap>ence to Sir William Draper.</p>
               <p>Your remarks upon a ſignature adopted merely for diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are unworthy of notice: but when you tell me I have ſubmitted to be called a liar and a coward, I muſt aſk you in my turn, Whether you ſeriouſly think it any way incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent upon me to take notice of the ſilly invectives of every ſimpleton who writes in a newſpaper; and what opinion you would have conceived of my diſcretion, if I had ſuffered my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be the dupe of ſo ſhallow an artifice?</p>
               <p>Your appeal to the ſword, though conſiſtent enough with your late profeſſion, will neither prove your innocence, nor clear you from ſuſpicion.—Your complaints with regard to the Manilla ranſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

You were appointed (greatly out of your turn) to the command of a regiment; and <hi>daring that admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration</hi> we heard no more of Sir William Draper. The facts of which I ſpeak may indeed be variouſly accounted for, but they are too notorious to be denied: and I think you might have learnt at the univerſity, that a falſe concluſion is an error in argument, not a breach of veracity. Your ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citations, I doubt not, were renewed under <hi>another</hi> admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. Admitting the fact, I fear an indifferent perſon would only infer from it, that experience had made you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the benefits of complaining. Remember, Sir, that you have yourſelf confeſſed, that, <hi>conſidering the critical ſituation of this country, the miniſtry are in the right to temporize with Spain.</hi> This confeſſion reduces you to an unfortunate dilemma.

               <p>As to me, it is by no means neceſſary that I ſhould be expoſed to the reſentment of the worſt and moſt powerful men in this country, though I may be indifferent about your's. Though yea would fight, there are others who would aſſaſſinate.</p>

               <p>But after all, Sir, where is the injury? You aſſure me, that my logic is puerile and tinſel; that it carries not the leaſt weight or conviction; that my premiſes are falſe, and my concluſions abſurd. If this be a juſt deſcription of me, how is it poſſible for ſuch a writer to diſturb your peace of mind, or to injure a character ſo well eſtabliſhed as yours?

But courage, conſtancy and patience under torments, have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cauſed the moſt hardened monſters to relent, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give the object of their cruelty. You, Sir, are determined to try all that haman nature can endure, until ſhe expires; elſe, was it poſſible that you could be the author of that moſt inhuman letter to the Dake of Bedford, I have read with aſtoniſhment and horror? Where, Sir, where were the feelings of your own heart, when you could upbraid a moſt affectionate father with the loſs of his only and moſt amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſon? Read over again thoſe cruel lines of yours, and let them wring your very ſoul. Cannot political queſtions be diſcuſſed without deſcending to the moſt odious perſonalities? Moſt you go wantonly out of your way to torment declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing age, becauſe the Duke of Bedford may have quarelled with thoſe whoſe cauſe and politics you eſpouſe? For ſhame! for ſhame! As you have <hi>ſpoke daggers</hi> to him, you may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dread the <hi>uſe</hi> of them againſt your own breaſt, did a want of courage, or of noble ſentiments, ſtimulate him to ſuch mean revenge. He is above it; he is brave. Do you fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that your own baſe arts have infected our whole iſland? But your own reflections, your own conſcience, muſt and will, if you have any ſpark of humanity remaining, give
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:023477_0107_0FBFB5A0ACA40250"/>him moſt ample revenge. Not all the power of words with which you are ſo graced, will ever waſh out, or even palliate, this foul blot in your character. I have not time at preſent to diſſect your letter ſo minutely as I could wiſh; but I will be bold enough to ſay, that it is (as to reaſon and argument) the moſt extraordinary piece of <hi>florid impotence</hi> hat was ever impoſed upon the eyes and ears of the too credulous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded mob. It accuſes the Duke of Bedford of high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Upon what foundation? You tell us, <q>that the <g ref="char:startq">“</g>Duke's <hi>pecuniary character</hi> makes it more than <hi>probable,</hi> that he could not have made ſuch ſacrifices at the peace, without <hi>ſome private compenſations:</hi> that his conduct carried with it an interior evidence, beyond all the legal proofs <g ref="char:endq">”</g>of a court of juſtice.</q>
               </p>
               <p>My academical education, Sir, bids me tell you, that it is neceſſary to eſtabliſh the truth of your firſt propoſition, before you preſume to draw inferences from it. Firſt prove the ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, before you make the raſh, haſty, and moſt wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. This father, <hi>Junius,</hi> whom you call avaricious, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed that ſon eight thouſand pounds a year. Upon his moſt unfortunate death, which your uſual good-nature <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ook care to remind him of, he greatly increaſed the jointure of the afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lady his widow. Is this avarice? Is this doing good by <hi>ſtealth?</hi> It is upon record.</p>
               <p>If exact order, method, and true oeconomy as a maſter of a family; if ſplendor and juſt magnificence, without wild waſte and thoughtleſs extravagance, may conſtitute the character of an avaricious man, the Duke is guilty. But for a moment let us admit that an ambaſſador may love money too much; what proof do you give that he has taken any to betray his country? Is it hearſay, or the evidence of letters, or ocular; or the evidence of thoſe concerned in this black affair? Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce your authorities to the public. It is an impudent kind of ſorcery, to attempt to blind us with the ſmoke, without convincing us that the fire has exiſted. You firſt brand him with a vice that he is free from, to render him odious and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected. Suſpicion is the foul weapon with which you make all your chief attacks; with that you ſtab. But ſhall one of the firſt ſubjects of the realm be ruined in his fame; ſhall even his life be in conſtant danger, from a charge built upon ſuch ſandy foundations? Muſt his houſe be beſieged by lawleſs ruffians, his journey impeded, and even the aſylum of an altar
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:023477_0108_0FBFB5A21E569DE8"/>be inſecure from aſſertions ſo baſe and falſe? Potent as he is, the Duke is amenable to juſtice; if guilty, puniſhable. The Patliament is the high and ſolemn tribunal for matters of ſuch great moment. To that be they ſubmitted. But I hope al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that ſome notice will be taken of, and ſome puniſhment inflicted upon, falſe accuſers; eſpecially upon ſuch, <hi>Junius,</hi> who are <hi>wilfully falſe.</hi> In any truth I will agree even with <hi>Junius;</hi> will agree with him that it is highly unbecoming the dignity of peers to tamper with boroughs. Ariſtocracy is as fatal as democracy. Our conſtitution admits of neither. It lores 2 King, Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>

               <p>IF Sir William Draper's bed be a bed of torture, he has made it for himſelf. I ſhall never interrupt his repoſe. Having changed the ſubject, there are parts of his laſt letter not undeſerving of a reply. Leaving his private character and conduct out of the queſtion, I ſhall conſider him merely in the capacity of an author, whoſe labours certainly do no diſcredit to a newſpaper.</p>
               <p>We ſay, in common diſcourſe, that a man may be his own enemy; and the frequency of the fact makes the expreſſion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teligible. But that a man ſhould be the bittereſt enemy of his friends, implies a contradiction of a peculiar nature. There is ſomething in it, which cannot be conceived without a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of ideas, nor expreſſed without a ſoleciſm in language. Sir William Drapes is ſtill that fatal friend Lord Granby found him. Yet I am ready to do juſtice to his generoſity; if indeed it be not ſomething more than generous, to be the voluntary advocate of men who think themſelves injured by his aſſiſtance, and to conſider nothing in the cauſe he adopts but the difficulty of defending i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> compare or confound the tortures of the body with thoſe of the mind. He ought to have known, though perhaps it might not be his intereſt to confeſs, that no outward tyranny can reach the mind. If conſcience plays the tyrant, it would be greatly for the benefit of the world that ſhe were more arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and far leſs placable, than ſome men find her.</p>
               <p>Bu it ſeems I have outraged the feelings of a father's heart.—And I indeed ſo injudicious? Does Sir William Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per think I would have hazarded my credit with a generous nation, by ſo groſs a violation of the laws of humanity? Does he think I am ſo little acquainted with the firſt and
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:023477_0110_0FBFB5B10F4D2128"/>nobleſt characteriſtic of Engliſhmen? Or how will be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile ſuch folly with an underſtanding ſo full of artifice as mine? Had <hi>be</hi> been a father, he would have been but little offended with the ſeverity of the reproach, for his mind would have been filled with the juſtice of it. He would have ſeen that I did not inſult the feelings of a father, but the father who felt nothing. He would have truſted to the evidence of his own paternal heart; and boldly denied the poſſibility of the fact, inſtead of defending it. Againſt whom then will his honeſt indignation be directed, when I aſſure him, that this whole town beheld the Duke of Bedford's conduct upon the death of his ſon, with horror and aſtoniſhment? Sir William Draper does himſelf but little ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in oppoſing the general ſenſe of his country. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are ſeldom wrong in their opinions;—in their ſentiments they are never miſtaken. There may be a vanity perhaps in a ſingular way of thinking;—but when a man profeſſes a want of thoſe feelings which do honour to the multitude, he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards ſomething infinitely more important than the character of his underſtanding. After all, as Sir William may poſſibly be in earneſt in his anxiety for the Duke of Bedford. I ſhould be glad to relieve him from it. He may reſt aſſured this wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy nobleman laughs, with equal indifference, at <hi>my</hi> reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and Sir William's diſtreſs about him. But here let it ſtop. Even the Duke of Bedford, inſenſible as he is, will conſult the tranquility of his life, in not provoking the moderation of my temper. If, from the profoundeſt contempt, I ſhould ever riſe into anger, he ſhould ſoon find, that all I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid of him was lenity and compaſſion.</p>
               <p>Out of a long catalogue, Sir William Draper has confined himſelf to the refutation of two charges only. The reſt he had not time to diſcuſs; and indeed it would have been a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious undertaking. To draw up a defence of ſuch a ſeries of enormities, would have required a life at leaſt as long as that which has been uniformly employed in the practice of them. The public opinion of the Duke of Bedford's extreme oeconomy is, it ſeems, entirely without foundation. Though not very prodigal abroad, in his own family at leaſt he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and munificent. He pays his debts, abhore a beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> has improved upon the proverb, and ended where it began. Admitting the whole force of this ſingle inſtance of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:023477_0111_0FBFB5B1E09650D0"/>generoſity (wonderful indeed, conſidering the narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his fortune, and the little merit of his only ſon), the public may ſtill perhaps be diſſatisfied, and demand ſome other leſs equivocal proofs of his munificence. Sir William Draper ſhould have entered boldly into the detail—of indigence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved—of arts encouraged—of ſcience patronized, men of learning protected, and works of genius rewarded;—in ſhort, had there been a ſingle inſtance, beſides Mr. Rigby<note n="*" place="bottom">This gentleman is ſuppoſed to have the ſame idea of <hi>bluſhirg,</hi> that a man blind from his birth has of ſcarlet or ſky-blue.</note>, of bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing merit brought forward by the Duke for the ſervice of the public, it ſhould not have been omitted.</p>
               <p>I wiſh it were poſſible to eſtabliſh my inference with the ſame certainty, on which I believe the principle is founded. My concluſion, however, was not drawn from the principle alone. I am not ſo unjuſt as to reaſon from one crime to another; though I think, that, of all the vices, avarice is moſt apt to taint and corrupt the heart. I combined the known temper of the man with the extravagant conceſſions made by the ambaſſadors and though I doubt not ſufficient care was taken to leave no document of any treaſonable nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, I ſtill maintain that the conduct<note n="†" place="bottom">If Sir W.

                  </note> of this miniſter carries with it an internal and convincing evidence againſt him. Sir William Draper ſeems not to know the value or force of ſuch a proof. He will not permit us to judge of the motives of men, by the manifeſt tendency of their actions, nor by the notorious character of their minds. He calls for papers and witneſſes, with a triumphant ſecurity; as if nothing could be true, but what could be proved in a court of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Yet a religious man might have remembered, upon what foundation ſome truths, moſt intereſting to mankind, have been received and eſtabliſhed. If it were not for the internal evidence, which the pureſt of religions carries with it, what would have become of his once well-quoted deca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, and of the meekneſs of his Chriſtianity?</p>
               <p>The generous warmth of his reſentment makes him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the order of events. He forgets that the inſults and diſtreſſes which the Duke of Bedford has ſuffered, and which Sir William has lamented with many delicate touches of the
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:023477_0112_0FBFB5B35F142958"/>true pathetic, were only recorded in my letter to his Grace, not occaſioned by it. It was a ſimple candid narrative of facts; though, for aught I know, it may carry with it ſomething prophetic. His Grace undoubtedly has received ſeveral ominous hints; and I think, in certain circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, a wiſe man would do well to prepare himſelf for the event.</p>
               <p>But I have a charge of a heavier nature againſt Sir William Draper. He tells us that the Duke of Bedford is amenable to juſtice; that Parliament is a high and ſolemn tribunal; and that if guilty, he may be puniſhed by due courſe of law: and all this he ſays with as much gravity as if he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved one word of the matter. I hope, indeed, the day of impeachments will arrive, before this nobleman eſcapes out of life;—but to refer us to that mode of proceeding now, with ſuch a miniſtry, and ſuch a Houſe of Commons as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, what is it, but an indecent mockery of the common ſenſe of the nation? I think he might have contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with defending the greateſt enemy, without inſulting the diſtreſſes of his country.</p>
               <p>His concluding declaration of his opinion with re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

               <p>I VERY ſincerely applaud the ſpirit with which a lady has paid the debt of gratitude to her benefactor. Though I think ſhe has miſtaken the point, ſhe ſhows a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> makes her reſpectable. The queſtion turned upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal generoſity or avarice of a man, whoſe private fortune is immenſe. The proofs of his munificence muſt be drawn
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:023477_0113_0FBFB5B5AB9E2EF8"/>from the uſes to which he has applied that fortune. I was not ſpeaking of a Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, but of a rich Engliſh Duke, whoſe wealth gave him the means of doing as much good in this country, as he derived from his power in another. I am far from wiſhing to leſſen the merit of this ſingle benevolent action;—perhaps it is the more conſpicuous from ſtanding alone. All I mean to ſay is, that it proves nothing in the preſent argument.</p>

               <p>I AM well aſſured that <hi>Junius</hi> will never deſcend to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with ſuch a writer as <hi>Modeſtus</hi> (whoſe letter appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the gazetteer of Monday) eſpecially as the diſpute muſt be chiefly about words. Notwithſtanding the partiality of the public, it does not appear that <hi>Junius</hi> values himſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any ſuperior ſtill in compoſition; and I hope his time will always be more uſefully employed, than in the trifling refinements of verbal criticiſm. <hi>Modeſtus,</hi> however, ſhall have no reaſon to triumph in the ſilence and moderation of <hi>Junius.</hi> If he knew as much of the propriety of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, as I believe he does of the facts in queſtion, he would have been as cautions of attacking <hi>Junius</hi> upon his compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as he ſeems to be of entering into the ſubject of it: yet after all, the laſt is the only article of any importance to the public.</p>
               <p>I do not wonder at the unremitted rancour with which the Duke of Bedford and his adherents invariably ſpeak of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which we well know has been too much injured to be eaſily forgiven. But why muſt <hi>Junius</hi> be an Iriſhman?—<hi>The abſurdity of his writings betrays him</hi>—Waving all conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the inſult offered by <hi>Modeſtus</hi> to the declared judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the people (they may well bear this among the reſt.) let us follow the ſeveral inſtances, and try whether the charge the fairly ſupported.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>IT is not wonderful that the great cauſe, in which this country is engaged, ſhould have rouſed and engroſſed the
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:023477_0117_0FBFB5C5B9CEF340"/>whole attention of the people. I rather admire the generous ſpirit with which they feel and aſſert their intereſt in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant queſtion, than blame them for their indifference about any other. When the conſtitution is openly invaded, when the firſt original right of the people, from which all laws de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive their authority, is directly attacked, inferior grievances naturally loſe their force, and are ſuffered to paſs by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out puniſhment or obſervation. The preſent miniſtry are as ſingularly marked by their fortune as by their crimes. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of atoning for their former conduct by any wiſe or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular meaſure, they have found, in the enormity of one fact, a cover and defence for a ſeries of meaſures, which muſt have been fatal to any other adminiſtration. I fear we are too remiſs in obſerving the whole of their proceedings. Struck with the principal figure, we do not ſufficiently mark in what manner the canvaſs is filled up. Yet ſurely it is not a leſs crime, nor leſs fatal in its conſequences, to encourage a flagrant breach of the law by a military force, than to make uſe of the forms of Parliament to deſtroy the conſtitution.—The miniſtry ſeem determined to give us a choice of difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and, if poſſible, to perplex us with the multitude of their offences. The expedient is worthy of the Duke of Grafton. But though he has preſerved a gradation and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety in his meaſures, we ſhould remember that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is uniform. Dictated by the ſame ſpirit, they deſerve the ſame attention. The following fact, though of the moſt alarming nature, has not yet been clearly ſtated to the public; nor have the conſequences of it been ſufficiently underſtood. Had I taken it up at an earlier period, I ſhould have been accuſed of an uncandid, malignant precipitation, as if I watched for an unfair advantage againſt the miniſtry, and would not allow them a reaſonable time to do their duty. They now ſtand without excuſe. Inſtead of employing the leiſure they have had in a ſtrict examination of the offence, and puniſhing the offenders, they ſeem to have conſiderd <hi>that</hi> indulgence as a ſecurity to them; that, with a little time and management, the whole affair might be buried in ſilence and utterly forgotten.</p>
               <p>A major-general<note n="*" place="bottom">Major-General Ganſel.</note> of the army is arreſted by the ſheriff's officers for a conſiderable debt. He perſuades them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct him to the Tilt-yard in St. James's Park, under ſome
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:023477_0118_0FBFB5CE32E26DA0"/>pretence of buſineſs, which it imported him to ſettle before he was confined. He applies to a ſerjeant, not immediately on duty, to aſſiſt with ſome of his companions in favouring his eſcape. He attempts it. A buſtle enſues. The bailiffs claim their priſoner. An officer of the guards<note n="†" place="bottom">Lieutenant Dodd.</note>, not then on duty, takes part in the affair, applies to the lieutenant<note n="‡" place="bottom">Lieutenant Garth.</note> commanding the Tilt-yard guard, and urges him to turn out his guard to relieve a general officer. The lieutenant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines interfering in perſon; but ſtands at a diſtance, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the buſineſs to be done. The officer takes upon himſelf to order out the guard. In a moment they are in arms, quit their guard, march, reſcue the general, and drive away the ſheriff's officers; who in vain repreſent their right to the priſoner, and the nature of the arreſt. The ſoldiers firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the general into the guard-room; then eſcort him to a place of ſafety, with bayonets fixed, and in all the forms of military triumph. I will not enlarge upon the various cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances which attended this atrocious proceeding. The perſonal injury received by the officers of the law in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of their duty, may perhaps be atoned for by ſome private compenſation. I conſider nothing but the wound which has been given to the law itſelf, to which no remedy has been applied, no ſatisfaction made. Neither is it my deſign to dwell upon the miſconduct of the parties concerned, any farther than is neceſſary to ſhow the behaviour of the miniſtry in its true light. I would make every compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate allowance for the infatuation of the priſoner, the falſe and criminal diſcretion of one officer, and the madneſs of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I would leave the ignorant ſoldiers entirely out of the queſtion. They are certainly the leaſt guilty, though they are the only perſons who have yet ſuffered, even in the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of puniſhment<note n="*" place="bottom">A few of them were confined.</note>. The fact itſelf, however atrocious, is not the principal point to be conſidered. It might have happened under a more regular government, and with guards better diſciplined than ours. The main queſtion is. In what manner have the miniſtry acted on this extraordinary occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? A general officer calls upon the King's own guard, then actually on duty, to reſcue him from the laws of his country; yet at this moment he is in a ſituation no worſe
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:023477_0119_0FBFB5D0DD3D3AC0"/>than if he had not committed an offence, equally enormous in a civil and military view.—A lieutenant upon duty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly quits his guard, and ſuffers it to be drawn out by another officer, for a purpoſe which he well knew (as we may collect from an appearance of caution, which only makes his behaviour the more criminal) to be in the higheſt degree illegal. Has this gentleman been called to a court-martial to anſwer for his conduct? No. Has it been cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured? No. Has it been in any ſhape inquired into? No. Another lieutenant, not upon duty, nor even in his regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals, is daring enough to order out the King's guard, over which he had properly no command, and engages them in a violation of the laws of his country, perhaps the moſt ſingular and extravagant that ever was attempted.—What puniſhment has <hi>be</hi> ſuffered? Literally none. Suppoſing he ſhould be proſecuted at common law for the reſcue, will that circumſtance, from which the miniſtry can derive no merit, excuſe or juſtify their ſuffering ſo flagrant a breach of military diſcipline to paſs by unpuniſhed and unnoticed? Are they aware of the outrage offered to their Sovereign, when his own proper guard is ordered out to ſtop by main force the execution of his laws? What are we to conclude from ſo ſcandalous a neglect of their duty, but that they have other views, which can only be anſwered by ſecuring the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of the guards? The miniſter would hardly be ſo cautious of offending them, if he did not mean, in due time, to call for their aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the parties themſelves, let it be obſerved, that theſe gentlemen are neither young officers, nor very young men. Had they belonged to the unfiedged race of enſigns, who infeſt our ſtreets, and diſhonour our public places, it might perhaps be ſufficient to ſend them back to that diſcipline, from which their parents, judging lightly from the maturity of their vices, had removed them too ſoon. In this caſe, I am ſorry to ſee, not ſo much the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of youth, as the ſpirit of the corps, and the connivance of government. I do not queſtion that there are many brave and worthy officers in the regiments of guards, but conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them as a corps, I fear it will be found that they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good ſoldiers nor good ſubjects. Far be it from me to inſinuate the moſt diſtant reflection upon the army. On the contrary, I honour and eſteem the profeſſion; and if theſe
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:023477_0120_0FBFB5D2E6F65998"/>gentlemen were better ſoldiers, I am ſure they would be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſubjects.</p>
               <p>It is not that there is any internal vice or defect in the profeſſion itſelf as regulated in this country, but that it is the ſpirit of this particular corps to deſpiſe their profeſſion; and that, while they vainly aſſume the lead of the army, they make it matter of impertinent compariſon, and triumph over the braveſt troops in the world (I mean our marching regiments). that <hi>they</hi> indeed ſtand upon higher ground, and are privileged to neglect the laborious forms of military diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and duty. Without dwelling longer upon a moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious ſubject, I ſhall leave it to military men, who have ſeen a ſervice more active than the parade, to determine whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no I ſpeak truth.</p>
               <p>How far this dangerous ſpirit has been encouraged by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and to what pernicious purpoſes it may be applied hereafter, well deſerves our moſt ſerious conſideration. I know, indeed, that when this affair happened, an affectation of alarm ran through the miniſtry. Something muſt be done to ſave appearances. The caſe was too flagrant to be paſſed by abſolutely without notice. But how have they acted? Inſtead of ordering the officers concerned (and who, ſtrictly ſpeaking, are alone guilty) to be put under arreſt, and brought to trial, they would have it underſtood that they did their duty completely, in confining a ſerjeant and four private ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, until they ſhould be demanded by the civil power; ſo that while the officers, who ordered or permitted the poor men who obeyed theſe orders, who in a military view are no ways reſponſible for what they did, and who for that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon have been diſcharged by the civil magiſtrates, are the only objects whom the miniſtry have thought proper to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to puniſhment. They did not venture to bring even theſe men to a court-martial, becauſe they knew their evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence would be fatal to ſome perſons, whom they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to proteſt. Otherwiſe, I doubt not, the lives of theſe unhappy, friendleſs ſoldiers, would long ſince have been ſacrificed without ſcruple to the ſecurity of their guilty officers.</p>
               <p>I have been accuſed of endeavouring to inflame the paſſions of the people.—Let me now appeal to their underſtanding. If there be any tool of adminiſtration daring enough to deny theſe facts, or ſhameleſs enough to defend the conduct of the
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:023477_0121_0FBFB5D45FAB5490"/>miniſtry, let him come forward. I care not under what title he appears. He ſhall find me ready to maintain the truth of my narrative, and the juſtice of my obſervations upon it, as the hazard of my utmoſt credit with the public.</p>
               <p>Under the moſt arbitrary governments, the common ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of juſtice is ſuffered to take its courſe. The ſubject, though robbed of his ſhare in the legiſlature, is ſtill protected by the laws. The political freedom of the Engliſh conſtitution was once the pride and honour of an Engliſhman. The civil equality of the laws preſerved the property, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fened the ſafety, of the ſubject. Are theſe glorious privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges the birth-right of the people; or are we only tenants as the will of the miniſtry?—But that I know there is a ſpirit of reſiſtance in the hearts of my countrymen; that they value life, not by its conveniencies, but by the independence and dignity of their condition; I ſhould, at this moment appeal only to their diſcretion. I ſhould perſuade them to baniſh from their minds all memory of what we were; I ſhould tell them, this is not a time to remember that we were Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and give it as my laſt advice, to make ſome early agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the miniſter, that, ſince it has pleaſed him to rob us of thoſe political right which once diſtinguiſhed the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of a country where honour was happineſs, he would leave us at leaſt the humble obedient ſecurity of citizens, and graciouſly condeſcend to protect us in our ſubmiſſion.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  <date>NOVEMBER 14, 1769.</date>
               </opener>
               <p>THE variety of remarks which have been made upon the laſt letter of <hi>Junius,</hi> and my own opinion of the writer, who whatever may be his faults, is certainly not a weak man, have induced me to examine, with ſome attention, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of that letter. I could not perſuade myſelf, that, while he had plenty of important materials, he would have taken up a light or trifling occaſion to attack the miniſtry; and much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſs could I conceive that it was his intention to ruin the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:023477_0122_0FBFB5D6AF6BB5A0"/>concerned in the reſcue of General Ganſel, or to injure the General himſelf. Theſe are little objects, and can no way contribute to the great purpoſes he ſeems to have in view by addreſſing himſelf to the public.—Without conſidering the ornamented ſtyle he has adopted, I determined to look farther into the matter, before I decided upon the merits of his letter. The firſt ſtep I took was to inquire into the truth of the facts; for if theſe were either falſe or miſrepreſented, the moſt artful exertion of his underſtanding, in reaſoning upon them, would only be a diſgrace to him. Now, Sir, I hare ſound every circumſtance ſtated by <hi>Junius</hi> to be literally true. General Ganſel perſuaded the bailiffs to conduct him to the parade, and certainly ſolicited a corporal and other Soldiers to aſſiſt him in making this eſcape. Captain Dodd did certainly apply to Captain Garth for the aſſiſtance of his guard. Captain Garth declined appearing himſelf; but ſtood aloof, while the other took upon him to order out the King's guard, and by main force reſcued the General. It is alſo ſtrictly true, that the General was eſcorted by a file of muſqueteers to a place of ſecurity. Theſe are facts, Mr. Woodfall, which I promiſe you no gentleman in the guards will de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y. If all or any of them are falſe, why are they not contradicted by the parties themſelves? However ſecure againſt military cenſure, they have yet a character to loſe; and ſurely, if they are innocent, it is not beneath them to pay ſome attention to the opinion of the public.</p>
               <p>The force of <hi>Junius</hi>'s obſervations upon theſe facts cannot be better marked, than by ſtating and refuting the objections which have been made to them. One writer ſays, <q>Admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <g ref="char:startq">“</g>the officers have offended, they are puniſhable at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law; and will you have a Britiſh ſubject puniſhed <g ref="char:endq">”</g>twice for the ſame offence?</q>—I anſwer, that they have committed two offences, both very enormous, and violated two laws. The reſcue is one offence, the flagrant breach of diſcipline another: and hitherto it does not appean that they have been puniſhed, or even cenſured, for either. Another gentleman lays much ſtreſs upon the calamity of the caſe; and inſtead of diſproving facts, appeals at once to the compaſſion of the public. This idea, as well as the inſinuation that <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving the parties of their commiſſions would be an injury to their creditors,</hi> can only refer to General Ganſel. The other officers are in no diſtreſs, therefore have no claim to compaſſion; nor
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:023477_0123_0FBFB5D8E566EBB0"/>does it appear, that their creditors, of they have any, are more likely to be ſatisfied by their continuing in the guards. But this ſort of plea will not hold in any ſhape. Compaſſion to an offender, who has groſsly violated the laws, is in effect a cruelty to the peaceable object who has obſerved them; and, even admitting the force or any alleviating circumſtances, it is nevertheleſs true, that, in this inſtance, the royal compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on has interpoſed too ſoon. The legal and proper mercy of a King of England may remit the puniſhment, but ought not to ſtop the trial.</p>
               <p>Beſides theſe particular objections, there has been a cry raiſed againſt <hi>Junius</hi> for his malice and injuſtice in attacking the miniſtry, upon an event which they could neither hinder nor foreſee. This, I muſt affirm, is a falſe repreſentation of his argument. He lays no ſtreſs upon the event itſelf as a ground of accuſation againſt the miniſtry, but dwells entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon their ſubſequent conduct. He does not ſay that they are anſwerable for the offence; but for the ſcandalous neglect of their duty, in ſuffering an offence, ſo flagrant, to paſs by without notice or inquiry. Suppoſing them ever ſo regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of what they owe to the public, and as indifferent about the opinion as they are about the intereſts of their country, what anſwer, as officers of the crown, will they give to <hi>Junius,</hi> when he aſks them, <hi>Are they aware of the outrage offer dado their Sovereign, when his own proper guar is ordered out to ſtop by main force the execution of his laws?</hi>—And when we ſee a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry giving ſuch a ſtrange unaccountable protection to the officers of the guards, is it unfair to ſuſpect, that they have ſome ſecret and unwarrantable motives for their conduct? If they feel themſelves injured by ſuch a ſuſpicion, why do they not immediately clear themſelves from it, by doing their duty? For the honour of the guards, I cannot help expreſſing another ſuſpicion, that, if the commanding officer had not received a ſecret injunction to the contrary, he would, in the ordinary courſe of his buſineſs, have applied for a court-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to try the two ſubalterns; the one for quitting his guard, the other for taking upon him the command of the guard, and employing it in the manner he did. I do not mean to enter into or defend the ſeverity with which <hi>Junius</hi> treats the guards. On the contrary, I will ſuppoſe, for a moment, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a very different character. If this be true, in what light will they conſider the conduct of two ſubalterns, but as a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral

I did not attempt to blaſt year character by an indirect ambiguous inſinuation; but candidly ſtated to you a plain fact, which ſtruck directly at the integrity of a privy-counſellor, of a firſt commiſſioner of the treaſury, and of a heading miniſter, who is ſuppoſed to enjoy the firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>When the complaints of a brave and powerful people are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to increaſe in proportion to the wrongs they have ſuffered; when, inſtead of ſinking into ſubmiſſion, they are rouſed to reſiſtance; the time will ſoon arrive at which every inferior conſideration moſt yield to the ſecurity of the Sovereign, and to the general ſafety of the ſtate. There is a moment of difficulty and danger, at which flattery and falſehood can no longer deceive, and ſimplicity itſelf can no longer be miſled. Let us ſuppoſe it arrived. Let us ſuppoſe a gracious, well-intentioned prince, made ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible at laſt of the great duty he owes to his people, and of his own diſgraceful ſituation; that he looks round him for aſſiſtance, and aſks for no advice but how to gratify the wiſhes and ſecure the happineſs of his ſubjects. In theſe circumſtances, it may he matter of curious SPECULATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ON to conſider, if an honeſt man were permitted to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach a King, in what terms he would addreſs himſelf to his Sovereign. Let it be imagined, no matter how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, that the firſt prejudice againſt his character is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, that the ceremonious difficulties of an audience are ſurmounted, that he feels himſelf animated by the pureſt and moſt honourable affection to his King and country, and that the great perſon whom he addreſſes has ſpirit enough to bid him ſpeak freely, and underſtanding enough to liſten to him with attention. Unacquainted with the vain impertinence of forms, he would deliver his ſentiments with dignity and firmneſs, but not without reſpect.</p>

                     <p>IT is the misfortune of your life, and originally the cauſe of every reproach and diſtreſs which has attended your government, that you ſhould never have been acquainted with the language of truth, until you heard it in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of your people. It is not, however, too late to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the error of your education. We are ſtill inclined to
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:023477_0131_0FBFB5F1A16D1D18"/>make an indulgent allowance for the pernicious leſſons you received in your youth, and to form the moſt ſanguine hopes from the natural benevolence of your diſpoſition<note n="*" place="bottom">The plan of tutelage and future dominion ever the heir-apparent, laid many years ago at Carlton-houſe between the princeſs Dowager and her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite the Earl of Bate, was as groſs and palpable, as that which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed between Anne of Auſtria and Cardinal Mazarin to govern Lewis the Fourteenth, and in effect to prolong his minority until the end of their lives. That Prince had ſtrong <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>lly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected by his mother and her minion. A little experience however ſoon ſhowed him how ſhamefully he had been treated, and for what infamous purpoſes he had been kept in ignorance. Our great Edward <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                              <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                           </gap>, at an early period, had ſenſe enough to underſtand the nature of the connection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his abandoned mother and the deteſted Mortimer. But, ſince that time, humen nature, we may obſerve, is greatly altered for the better. Dowagers may be chaſte, and minions may he honeſt. When it was propoſed to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the preſent King's houſehold as Prince of Wales, it is well known that the Earl of Bute was forced into it, in direct contradiction to the late King's inclination. <hi>That</hi> was the ſalient point, from which all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moment, Lord Bute never ſuffered the Prince of Wales to be an inſtant out of his ſight.—We need not look farther.</note>. We are far from thinking you capable of a direct, deliberate purpoſe to invade thoſe original rights of your ſubjects, on which all their civil and political liberties depend. Had it been poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for us to entertain a ſuſpicion ſo diſhonourable to your character, we ſhould long ſince have adopted a ſtyle of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance very diſtant from the humility of complaint. The doctrine inculcated by our laws, <hi>That the King can do is wrong,</hi> is admitted without reluctance. We ſeparate the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, good-natured prince from the folly and treachery of his ſervants, and the private virtues of the man from the vices of his government. Were it not for this juſt diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I know not whether your Majeſty's condition, or that of the Engliſh nation, would deſerve moſt to be lamented. I would prepare your mind for a favourable reception of truth, by removing every painful, offenſive idea of perſonal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. Your ſubjects, Sir, wiſh for nothing but that as <hi>they</hi> are reaſonable and affectionate enough to ſeparate your perſon from your government, ſo <hi>you,</hi> in your turn, ſhould diſtinguiſh between the conduct which becomes the perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent dignity of a King, and that which ſerves only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the temporary intereſt and miſerable ambition of as miniſter.</p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="unknown:023477_0132_0FBFB5F3E5897B58"/>
                     <p>You aſcended the throne with a declared, and, I doubt not, a ſincere reſolution of giving univerſal ſatisfaction to your ſubjects. You found them pleaſed with the novelty of a young prince, whoſe countenance promiſed even more than his words; and loyal to you, not only from principle, but paſſion. It was not a cold profeſſion of allegiance to the firſt magiſtrate; but a partial, animated attachment to a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite prince, the native of their country. They did not wait to examine your conduct, nor to be determined by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience; but gave you a generous credit for the future bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of your reign, and paid you in advance the deareſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of their affections. Such, Sir, was once the diſpoſition of a people, who now ſurronnd your throne with reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and complaints. Do juſtice to yourſelf. Baniſh from your mind thoſe unworthy opinions, with which ſome inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted perſons have laboured to poſſeſs you.—Diſtruſt the men who tell you that the Engliſh are naturally light and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant —that they complain without a cauſe. Withdraw your confidence equally from all parties; from miniſters, favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites, and relations; and let there be one moment in your life, in which you have conſulted your own underſtanding.</p>
                     <p>When you affectedlly renounced the name of Engliſhman, believe me, Sir, you were perſuaded to pay a very ill-judged compliment to one part of your ſubjects, at the expence of another. While the natives of Scotland are not in actual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, they are undoubtedly entitled to protection: nor do I mean to condemn the policy of giving ſome encouragement to the novelty of their affections for the houſe of Hanover. I am ready to hope for every thing from their new-born zeal, and from the future ſteadineſs of their allegiance. But hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto they have no claim to your favour. To honour them with a determined predilection and confidence, in excluſion of your Engliſh ſubjects, who placed your family, and, in ſpite of treachery and rebellion, have ſupported it upon the throne, is a miſtake too groſs even for the unſuſpecting ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity of youth. In this error we ſee a capital violations of the moſt obvious rules of policy and prudence. We trace it, however, to an original bias in your education, and are ready to allow for your inexperience.</p>
                     <p>To the ſame early influence we attribute it, that you have deſcended to take a ſhare not only in the narrow views and intereſts of particular perſons, but in the fatal malignity of
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:023477_0133_0FBFB5F55CDB5FF8"/>their paſſions. At your acceſſion is the throne, the whole ſyſtem of government was altered, not from wiſdom or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, but becauſe it had been adopted by your prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Without entering into a minster diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of the merits of the peace, we may obſerved in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent hurry with which the firſt overtores from France were accepted, in the conduct of the negociation and terms of the treaty, the ſtrongeſt marks of that precipitate ſpirit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion with which a certain part of your ſubjects have been at all times ready to purchaſe a peace with the natural enemies of this country. On <hi>your</hi> part we are ſatisfied that every thing was hornourable and ſincere; and if England was ſold to France, we doubt not that your Majeſty was equally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed. The conditions of the peace were matter of grief and ſurpriſe to your ſubjects, but not the immediate cauſe of their preſent diſcontent.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto, Sir, you have been ſacrificed to the prejudices and paſſions of others. With what firmneſs will you hear the mention of your own?</p>
                     <p>A man, not very honourably diſtinguiſhed in the world, commences a formal attack upon your favourite, conſidering nothing but how he might beſt expoſe his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                        </gap> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to deteſtation, and the national character of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen to contempt. The natives of that country, Sir, are as much diſtinguiſhed by a peculiar character, as by your Majeſty's favour. Like another choſen people, they have been conducted into the land of plenty, where they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves effectually marked and divided from mankind. There is hardly a period at which the moſt irregular character may not be redeemed. The miſtakes of one ſex find a retreat is patriotiſm, thoſe of the other in devotion. Mr. Wilkes brought with him into politics the ſame liberal ſentiments by which his private conduce had been directed: and ſeemed to think, that, as there are few exceſſes in which an Engliſh
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:023477_0134_0FBFB5FDC79DCC70"/>gentleman may not be permitted to indulge, the ſame lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude was allowed him in the choice of his political principles, and in the ſpirit of maintaining them—I mean to ſtate, not entirely to defend, his conduct.

                     <p>On this ſide then, whichever way you turn your eyes, you ſee nothing but perplexity and diſtreſs. You may determine to ſupport the very miniſtry who have reduced your affairs to this deplorable ſituation: you may ſhelter yourſelf under the forms of a Parliament, and ſet your people at cofiance. But be aſſured, Sir, that ſuch a reſolution would be as imprudent as it would be odious. If it did not immediately ſhake your eſtabliſhment, it would rob you of your peace of mind for ever.</p>

                     <p>On the other, how different is the proſpeſt! How eaſy, how ſafe and honourable, is the path before you! The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh nation declare they are groſsly injured by their repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and ſolicit your Majeſty to exert your lawful preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and give them an opportunity of recalling a truſt which they find has been ſcandalouſly abuſed. You are not to be told that the power of the Houſe of Commons is not ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, but delegated to them for the welfare of the people, from whom they received it. A queſtion of right ariſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the conſtituent and the repreſentative body. By what authority ſhall it be decided? Will your Majeſty interfere in a queſtion in which you have properly no immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern? —It would be a ſtep equally odious and unneceſſary. Shall the Lords be called upon to determine the rights and privileges of the Commons?—They cannot do it without a flagrant breach of the conſtitution. Or will you refer it to the judges?—They have often told your anceſtors, that the law of Parliament is above them. What part then remains, but to leave it to the people to determine for themſelves? They alone are injured; and ſince there is no ſuperior power to which the cauſe can the referred, they alone ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine.</p>
                     <p>I do not mean to perplex you with a tedious argument up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſubject already ſo diſcuſſed, that inſpiration could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly throw a new light upon it. There are, however, two points of view in which it particularly imports your Majeſty to conſider the late proceedings of the Houſe of Commons. By depriving a ſubject of his birthright, they have attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their own vote an authority equal to an act of the whole legiſlature; and, though perhaps not with the ſame motives, have ſtrictly followed the example of the long par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which firſt declared the regal office uſeleſs, and ſoon after, with as little ceremony, diſſolved the Houſe of Lords. The ſame pretended power, which robs an Engliſh ſubject of his birthright, may rob an Engliſh King of his crown. In another view, the reſolution of the Houſe of Commons, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently not ſo dangerous to your Majeſty, is ſtill more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming to your people. Not contented with diverting one man of his right, they have arbitrarily conveyed that right to another. They have ſet aſide a return as illegal, without daring to cenſure thoſe officers, who were particularly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed of Mr. Wilkes's incapacity, not only by the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:023477_0141_0FBFB60D8CA025B0"/>of the houſe, but expreſsly by the writ directed to them, and who nevertheleſs returned him as duly elected. They have rejected the majority of votes, the only criterion by which our laws judge of the ſenſe of the people; they have transferred the right of election from the collective to the repreſentative body; and by theſe acts, taken ſeparately or together, they have eſſentially altered the conſtitution of the Houſe of Commons. Verſed, as your Majeſty undoubtedly is, in the Engliſh hiſtory, it cannot eaſily eſcape you, how much it is your intereſt, as well as your duty, to prevent one of the three eſtates from encreaching upon the province of the other two, or aſſuming the authority of them all. When once they have departed from the great conſtitutional line, by which all their proceedings ſhould be directed, who will anſwer for their future moderation? Or what aſſurance will they give you, that, when they have trampled upon their equals, they will ſubmit to a ſuperior? Your Majeſty may learn hereafter, how nearly the ſlave and tyrant are allied.</p>
                     <p>Some of your council, more candid than the reſt, admit the abandoned profligacy of the preſent Houſe of Commons, but oppoſe their diſſolution upon an opinion, I confeſs, not very unwarrantable, that their ſucceſſors will be equally at the diſpoſal of the treaſury. I cannot perſuade myſelf that the nation will have profited ſo little by experience. But if that opinion were well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>You have ſtill an honourable part to act. The affections of your ſubjects may ſtill be recovered. But before you ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due <hi>their</hi> hearts, you muſt gain a noble victory over your own. Diſcand thoſe little, perſonal reſentments, which have too long directed your public conduct. Pardon this man the remainder of his puniſhment; and if reſentment ſtill remains, make it, what it ſhould have been long ſince, an act, not of mercy, but contempt. He will ſoon fall back into his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtation,—a ſilent ſenator, and hardly ſupporting the weekly eloquence of a newſpaper. The gentle breath of peace would leave him on the ſurface, neglected and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. It is only the tempeſt that lifts him from his place.</p>
                     <p>Without conſulting your miniſter, call together your whole
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:023477_0142_0FBFB6148B3FF588"/>council. Let it appear to the public, that you can deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and act for yourſelf. Come forward to your people. Lay aſide the wretched formalities of a King; and ſpeak to your ſubjects with the ſpirit of a man, and in the language of a gentleman. Tell them you have been fatally deceived. The acknowledgment will be no diſgrace, but rather an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to your underſtanding. Tell them you are determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to remove every cauſe of complaint againſt your govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that you will give your confidence to no man, who does not poſſeſs the confidence of your ſubjects; and leave it to themſelves to determine, by their conduct at a future election, whether or no it be in reality the general ſenſe of the nation, that their rights have been arbitrarily invaded by the preſent Houſe of Commons, and the conſtitution be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed. They will then do juſtice to their repreſentatives and to themſelves.</p>

               <p>IF I were perſonally your enemy, I might pity and forgive you. You have every claim to compaſſion, that can ariſe from miſery and diſtreſs. The condition you are reduced to, would diſarm a private enemy of his reſentment, and leave no conſolation to the moſt vindictive ſpirit, but that ſuch an object as you are would diſgrace the dignity of revenge.

               <p>The recollection of the royal patent you ſold to Mr. Hine, obliges me to ſay a word in defence of a man whom you have taken the moſt diſhonourable means to injure. I do not refer to the ſham proſecution which you carried on againſt him. On that ground, I doubt not, he is prepared to meet you with tenfold recrimination, and ſet you at defiance. The injury you had done him, affects his moral character. You knew that the offer to purchaſe the reverſion of a place, which has heretofore been ſold under a decree of the court of Chancery, however imprudent in his ſituation, would no way tend to cover him with that ſort of guilt which you wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to fix upon him in the eyes of the world.

If he really be, what I think him, honeſt, though miſtaken, he will be happy in recovering his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though at the expence of his underſtanding.

The reputation of obſtinacy and perſeverance might have ſupplied the place of all the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent virtues.

Retire then, my Lord, and hide your bluſhes from the world; for, with ſuch a load of ſhame, even BLACK may change its colour. A mind ſuch as yours, in the ſolitary hours of domeſtic enjoyment, may ſtill find topics of conſolation. You may find it in the memory of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated friendſhip; in the afflictions of an accompliſhed prince, whom you have diſgraced and deſerted; and, in the agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a great country, driven, by your counſels, to the brink of deſtruction.</p>

Your Grace was the firm miniſter of yeſterday; Lord North is the firm miniſter of to-day. To-morrow, perhaps, his Majeſty, in his wiſdom, may give us a rival for you both. You are too well acquainted with the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of your late allies, to think it poſſible that Lord North ſhould be permitted to govern this country. If we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve common fame, they have ſhown him their ſuperiority already. His Majeſty is indeed too gracious to inſult his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by chooſing his firſt miniſter from among the domeſtics of the Duke of Bedford. That would have been too groſs an outrage to the three kingdoms. Their purpoſe, however, is equally anſwered by puſhing forward this unhappy figure, and forcing it to bear the odium of meaſures which they in reality direct. Without immediately appearing to govern, they poſſeſs the power and diſtribute the emoluments of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as they think proper. They ſtill adhere to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of that calculation which made Mr. Luttrell repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Middleſex. Far from regretting your retreat, they aſſure us very gravely, that it increaſes the real ſtrength of the miniſtry. According to this way of reaſoning, they will probably grow ſtronger, and more flouriſhing, every hour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

But, alas! their countenances ſpeak a different language. When the members drop off, the main body cannot be inſenſible of its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching

                  <date>MARCH 19, 1770.</date>
               </opener>
               <p>I BELIEVE there is no man, however indifferent about the intereſts of this country, who will not readily confeſs that the ſituation to which we are now reduced, whether it has ariſen from the violence of faction, or from an arbitrary ſyſtem of government, juſtifies the moſt melancholy appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, and calls for the exertion of whatever wiſdom or vigour is left among us. The King's anſwer to the remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance of the city of London, and the meaſures ſince adopted by the miniſtry, amount to a plain declaration, that the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, on which Mr. Luttrell was ſeated in the Houſe of Commons, is to be ſupported in all its conſequences, and carried to its utmoſt extent. The ſame ſpirit, which violated the freedom of election, now invades the declaration and bills of rights, and threatens to puniſh the ſubject for exerciſing a privilege, hitherto undiſputed, of petitioning the crown. The grievances of the people are aggravated by inſults; their complaints not merely diſregarded, but checked by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and every one of thoſe acts, againſt which they remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated, confirmed by the King's deciſive approbation. At ſuch a moment, no honeſt man will remain ſilent or inactive. However diſtinguiſhed by rank or property, in the rights of freedom we are equal. As we are Engliſhmen, the leaſt conſiderable man among us has an intereſt equal to the proud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt nobleman, in the laws and conſtitution of this country, and is equally called upon to make a generous contribution in ſupport of them;—whether it be the heart to conceive, the underſtanding to direct, or the hand to execute. It is a common cauſe, in which we are all intereſted, in which we ſhould all be engaged. The man who deſerts it at this
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:023477_0151_0FBFB6329ADF9F98"/>alarming criſis, is an enemy to his country, and, what I think of infinitely leſs importance a traitor to his Sovereign. The ſubject, who is truly loyal to the chief magiſtrate, will neither adviſe nor ſubmit to arbitrary meaſures. The city of London hath given an example, which, I doubt not, will be followed by the whole kingdom. The noble ſpirit of the metropolis is the life-blood of the ſtate, collected at the heart: from that point it circulates, with health and vigour, through every artery of the conſtitution. The time is come, when the body of the Engliſh people muſt aſſert their own cauſe: conſcious of their ſtrength, and animated by a ſenſe of their duty, they will not ſurrender their birth-right to miniſters, Parliaments, or Kings.</p>
               <p>The city of London have expreſſed their ſentiments with freedom and firmneſs; they have ſpoken truth boldly, and, in whatever light their remonſtrance may be repreſented by frontiers, I defy the moſt ſubtle lawyer in this country to point out a ſingle inſtance in which they have exceeded the truth. Even that aſſertion, which we are told is moſt offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to Parliament, in the theory of the Engliſh conſtitution, is ſtrictly true. If any part of the repreſentative body be not choſen by the people, that part vitiates and corrupts the whole. If there be a defect in the repreſentation of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> may attend the practice, I am ready to maintain, that as far as the fact de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viates from the principle, ſo far the practice is vicious and corrupt. I have not heard a queſtion raiſed upon any other part of the remonſtrance. That the principle on which the Middleſex election was determined, is more pernicious in its effects than either the levying of ſhip-money by Charles I. or the ſuſpending power aſſumed by his ſon, will hardly be diſputed by any man who underſtands or wiſhes well to the Engliſh conſtitution. It is not an act of open violence done by the King, or any direct or palpable breach of the laws at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by his miniſter, that can ever endanger the liberties of this country. Againſt ſuch a King or miniſter the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would immediately take the alarm, and all parties unite to oppoſe him. The laws may be groſsly violated in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:023477_0152_0FBFB6351A8A3468"/>inſtances, without any direct attack upon the whole ſyſtem. Facts of that kind ſtand alone; they are attributed to neceſſity, not defended by principle. We can never be really in danger, until the forms of Parliament are made uſe of to deſtroy the ſubſtance of our civil and political liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; —until Parliament itſelf betrays its truſt, by contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting to eſtabliſh new principles of government, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying the very weapons committed to it by the collective body, to ſtab the conſtitution.</p>
               <p>As for the terms of the remonſtrance. I preſume it will not be affirmed, by any perſon leſs poliſhed than a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-uſher, that this is a ſeaſon for compliments. Our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious King indeed is abundantly civil to himſelf. Inſtead of an anſwer to a petition, his Majeſty very graciouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces his own panegyric; and I confeſs, that, as far as his perſonal behaviour, or the royal purity of his intentions, is concerned, the truth of thoſe declarations, which the miniſter has drawn up for his maſter, cannot decently be diſputed. In every other reſpect, I affirm, that they are abſolutely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupported either in argument or fact. I muſt add too, that ſuppoſing the ſpeech were otherwiſe unexceptionable, it is not a direct anſwer to the petition of the city. His Majeſty is pleaſed to ſay, that he is always ready to receive the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of his ſubjects: yet the ſheriffs were twice ſent back with an excuſe, and it was certainly debated in council, whether or no the magiſtrates of the city of London ſhould be admitted to an audience. Whether the remonſtrance be or be not injurious to Parliament, is the very queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Parliament and the people; and ſuch a queſtion as cannot be decided by the aſſertion of a third party, however reſpectable. That the petitioning for a diſſolution of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is irreconcil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

His Majeſty perhaps has not been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that the Houſe of Commons themſelves have, by a formal reſolution, admitted it to be the right of the ſubject. His Majeſty proceeds to aſſure us, that he has made the laws the rule of his conduct.—Was it in ordering or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting his miniſters to apprehend Mr. Wilkes by a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral warrant? Was it in ſuffering his miniſters to revive the obſolete maxim of <hi>nullum tempus</hi> to rob the Duke of Portland of his property, and thereby give a deciſive turn to a county election?—Was it in erecting a chamber conſultation of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons,

Or did his Majeſty conſult the laws of this country, when he permitted his ſecretary of ſtate to declare, that, whenever the civil magiſtrate is trifled with, a military force muſt be ſent for, <hi>without the delay of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

To talk of preſerving the affections, or relying on the ſupport, of his ſubjects, while he continues to act upon theſe principles, is indeed paying a compliment to their loyalty, which I hope they have too much ſpirit and underſtanding to deſerve.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty, we are told, is not only punctual in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his own duty, but careful not to aſſume any of thoſe powers which the conſtitution has placed in other hands. Admitting this laſt aſſertion to be ſtrictly true, it is no way to the purpoſe. The city of London have not deſired the King to aſſume a power placed in other hands. If they had, I ſhould hope to ſee the perſon, who dated to preſent ſuch a petition, immediately impeached. They ſolicit their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to exert that conſtitutional authority, which the laws have veſted in him, for the benefit of his ſubjects. They call upon him to make uſe of his lawful prerogative in a caſe, which our laws evidently ſuppoſed might happen, ſince they have provided for it by truſting the Sovereign with a diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary power to diſſolve the Parliament. This requeſt will, I am confident, be ſupported by remonſtrances from all parts of the kingdom. His Majeſty will find at laſt, that this is the ſenſe of his people; and that it is not his intereſt to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port either miniſtry or Parliament, at the hazard of a breach with the collective body of his ſubjects.—That he is the King of a free people, is indeed his greateſt glory. That he may long continue the King of a free people, is the ſecond wiſh that animates my heart.

               <head>LETTER XXXVIII. TO THE PRINTER OF THE PUBLIC ADVERTISER.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  <date>APRIL 3, 1770.</date>
               </opener>
               <p>IN my laſt letter, I offered you my opinion of the truth and propriety of his Majeſty's anſwer to the city of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, conſidering it merely as the ſpeech of a miniſter, drawn up in his own defence, and delivered, as uſual, by the chief magiſtrate. I would ſeparate, as much as poſſible, the King's perſonal character and behaviour from the acts of the preſent government. I wiſh it to be underſtood that his Majeſty had in effect no more concern in the ſubſtance of what he ſaid, than Sir James Hodges had in the remonſtrance; and that as Sir James, in virtue of his office, was obliged to ſpeak the ſentiments of the people, his Majeſty might think himſelf bound, by the ſame official obligation, to give a graceful ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terance to the ſentiments of his miniſter. The cold formality of a well-repeated leſſon, is widely diſtant from the animated expreſſion of the heart.</p>
               <p>This diſtinction, however, is only true with reſpect to the meaſure itſelf. The conſequences of it reach beyond the miniſter, and materially affect his Majeſty's honour. In their own nature they are formidable enough to alarm a man of prudence, and diſgraceful enough to afflict a man of ſpirit. A ſubject, whoſe ſincere attachment to his Majeſty's perſon and family is founded upon rational principles, will not, in the preſent conjuncture, be ſcrupulous of alarming, or even afflicting, his Sovereign. I know there is another ſort of loyalty, of which his majeſty has had plentiful experience. When the loyalty of Tories, Jacobites, and Scotchmen, has once taken poſſeſſion of an unhappy Prince, it ſeldom leaves him without accompliſhing his deſtruction. When the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their doctrines have tainted the natural benevolence of his diſpoſition, when their inſidious counſels have corrupted the <hi>ſtamina</hi> of his government, what antidote can reſtore him to his political health and honour, but the firm ſincerity of his Engliſh ſubjects?</p>
               <p>It has not been uſual in this country, at leaſt ſince the days of Charles I. to ſee the Sovereign perſonally at variance, or
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:023477_0155_0FBFB63DB7CB4788"/>engaged in a direct altercation with his ſubjects. Acts of grave and indulgence are wiſely appropriated to him, and ſhould conſtantly be performed by himſelf. He never ſhould appear but in an amiable light to his ſubjects. Even in France, as long as any ideas of a limited monarchy were thought worth preſerving, it was a maxim, that no man ſhould leave the royal preſence diſcontented. They have loſt or renounced the moderate principles of their government; and now when their Parliaments venture to remonſtrate, the tyrant comes forward, and anſwers abſolutely for himſelf. The ſpirit of their preſent conſtitution requires that the King ſhould be feared: and the principle, I believe, is tolerably ſupported by the fact. But, in our political ſyſtem, the the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory is at variance with the practice; for the King ſhould be beloved; meaſures of greater ſeverity may, indeed, in ſome circumſtances, be neceſſary; but the miniſter who adviſes, ſhould take the execution and odium of them entirely upon himſelf. He not only betrays his maſter, but violates the ſpirit of the Engliſh conſtitution, when he expoſes the chief magiſtrate to the perſonal hatred or contempt of his ſubjects. When we ſpeak of the firmneſs of government, we mean an uniform ſyſtem of meaſures, deliberately adopted, and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely maintained by the ſervants of the crown; not a peev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh aſperity in the language or behaviour of the Sovereign. The government of a weak irreſolute monarch may be wiſe, moderate, and firm; that of an obſtinate capricious prince, on the contrary, may be feeble, undetermined, and relaxed. The reputation of public meaſures depends upon the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who is reſponſible; not upon the King, whoſe private opinions are not ſuppoſed to have any weight againſt the advice of his council, and whoſe perſonal authority ſhould therefore never be interpoſed in public affairs.—This I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is true conſtitutional doctrine. But for a moment let us ſuppoſe it falſe. Let it be taken for granted, that an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may ariſe in which a King of England ſhall be compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to take upon himſelf the ungrateful office of rejecting the petitions and cenſuring the conduct of his ſubjects; and let the city-remonſtrance be ſuppoſed to have created ſo extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary an occaſion. On this principle, which I preſume no friend of adminiſtration will diſpute, let the wiſdom and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the miniſtry be examined. They adviſe the King to hazard his dignity, by a poſitive declaration of his own ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents.
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:023477_0156_0FBFB63EF682ECF0"/>—They ſuggeſt to him a language full of ſeverity and reproach. What follows? When his Majeſty had taken ſo deciſive a part in ſupport of his miniſtry and Parliament, he had a right to expect from them a reciprocal demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of firmneſs in their own cauſe, and of their zeal for his honour. He had reaſon to expect (and ſuch, I doubt not, were the bluſtering promiſes of Lord North), that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whom he had been adviſed to charge with having fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their reſpect to him, with having injured Parliament and violated the principles of the conſtitution, ſhould not have been permitted to eſcape without ſome ſevere marks of the diſpleaſure and rengeance of Parliament. As the matter ſtands, the miniſter, after placing his Sovereign in the moſt unfavourable light to his ſubjects, and after attempting to fix the ridicule and odium of his own precipitate meaſures upon the royal character, leaves him a ſolitary figure upon the ſcene, to recall, if he can, or to compenſate, by future compliances, for one unhappy demonſtration of ill-ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed firmneſs and ineffectual reſentment. As a man of ſpirit, his Majeſty cannot but be ſenſible, that the lofty terms in which he was perſuaded to reprimand the city, when united with the ſilly concluſion of the buſineſs, reſemble the pomp of a mock tragedy, where the moſt pathetic ſentiments, and even the ſufferings of the hero, are calculated for deriſion.</p>
               <p>Such has been the boaſted firmneſs and conſiſtency of a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter<note n="*" place="bottom">This graceful miniſter is oddly conſtruſted. His tongue is a little too big for his mouth, and his eyes a great deal too big for their ſockets. Every part of his perſon ſets natural proportion at defiance. At this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent writing, his head is ſuppoſed to be much too heavy for his ſhoulders.</note>, whoſe appearance in the Houſe of Commons was thought eſſential to the King's ſervice:—whoſe preſence was to influence every diviſion;—who had a voice to perſuade, an eye to penetrate, a geſture to command. The reputation of theſe great qualities has been fatal to his friends. The little dignity of Mr. Ellis has been committed. The mine was ſunk; combuſtibles were provided; and Welbore Ellis, the Guy Faux of the ſable, waited only for the ſignal of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. All of a ſudden the country gentlemen diſcover how groſsly they have been deceived:—the miniſter's heart fails him; the grand plot is defeated in a moment; and poor Mr. Ellis and his motion taken into cuſtody. From the event of Friday laſt, one would imagine that ſome fatality hung over
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:023477_0157_0FBFB64399018510"/>this gentleman. Whether he makes or ſuppreſſes a motion, he is equally ſure of his diſgrace. But the complexion of the times will ſuffer no man to be vice-treaſurer of ireland with impunity<note n="*" place="bottom">About this time, the courtiers talked of nothing but a bill of pains and penalties againſt the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, or impeachment at the leaſt. Little <hi>Mannikin Ellis</hi> told the King, that, if the buſineſs were left to his management, he would engage to do wonders. It was thought very odd, that a motion of ſo much importance ſhould be entruſted to the moſt contemptible little piece of machinery in the whole kingdom. His honeſt zeal however was diſappointed. The miniſter took fright; and, at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry inſtant that little Ellis was going to open, ſent him an order to ſit down. All their magnanimous threats ended in a ridiculous vote of cenſure, and a ſtill more ridiculous addreſs to the King. This ſhameful deſertion ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted the generous mind of George the Third, that he was obliged to live upon potatoes for three weeks, to keep off a malignant fever.—Poor man!—<hi>

               <p>I do not mean to expreſs the ſmalleſt anxiety for the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter's reputation. He acts ſeparately for himſelf; and the moſt ſhameful inconſiſtency may perhaps be no diſgrace to him. But when the Sovereign, who repreſents the majeſty of the ſtate, appears in perſon, his dignity ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. The occaſion ſhould be important;—the plan well conſidered;—the execution ſteady and conſiſtent. My zeal for his Majeſty's real honour compels me to aſſert, that it has been too much the ſyſtem of the preſent reign, to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him perſonally, either to act for, or to defend his ſervants. They perſuade him to do what is properly <hi>their</hi> buſineſs, and deſert him in the midſt of it<note n="†" place="bottom">After a certain perſon had ſucceeded in cajoling Mr. Yorke, he told the Duke of Grafton, with a witty ſmile, <q>My Lord, you may kill the <g ref="char:startq">“</g>

Inſtead of reſerving the interpoſition of the royal perſonage as the laſt reſource of government, their weakneſs obliges them to apply it to every ordinary oecaſion, and to render it cheap and common in the opinion of the people. Inſtead of ſupporting their maſter, they look to <hi>him</hi> for ſupport; and, for the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luments of remaining one day more in office, care not how much his ſacred character is proſtituted and diſhonoured.</p>

               <p>If I thought it poſſible for this paper to reach the cloſet, I would venture to appeal at once to his Majeſty's judgment. I would aſk him, but in the moſt reſpectful terms, <q>As you <g ref="char:startq">“</g>are a young man, Sir, who ought to have a life of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in proſpect;—as you are a huſband;—as you are a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, [your filial duties, I own, have been religiouſly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed;] is it <hi>bona fide</hi> for your intereſt or your honour, to ſacrifice your domeſtic tranquillity, and to live in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual diſagreement with your people, merely to preſerve ſuch a chain of beings as North, Barrington, Weymouth, Gower, Ellis, Onſtow, Rigby, Jerry Dyſon, and Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich?

               </p>
               <p>For my own part, Sir, I have always conſidered addreſſes from Parliament, as a faſhionable, unmeaning formality. Uſurpers, ideots, and tyrants, have been ſucceſſively compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with almoſt the ſame profeſſions of duty and affection. But let us ſuppoſe them to mean exactly what they profeſs. The conſequences deſerve to be conſidered. Either the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign is a man of high ſpirit and dangerous ambition, ready to take advantage of the treachery of his Parliament, ready to accept of the ſurrender they make him of the public liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; —or he is a mild, undeſigning prince, who, provided they indulge him with a little ſtate and pageantry, would of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf intend no miſchief. On the firſt ſuppoſition, it muſt ſoon be decided by the ſword, whether the conſtitution ſhould be loſt or preſerved. On the ſecond, a prince no way qualified for the execution of a great and hazardous enterprize, and without any determined object in view, may nevertheleſs be driven into ſuch deſperate meaſures, as may lead directly to his ruin, or diſgrace himſelf by a ſhameful fluctuation between the extremes of violence at one moment, and timidity at an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. The miniſter, perhaps, may have reaſon to be ſatisfied with the ſucceſs of the preſent hour, and with the profits of his employment. He is the tenant of the day, and has no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the inheritance. The Sovereign himſelf is bound by other obligations; and ought to look forward to a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, a permanent intereſt. His paternal tenderneſs ſhould remind him, how many hoſtages he has given to ſociety. The ties of nature come powerfully in aid of oaths and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations. The father, who conſiders his own precarious
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:023477_0159_0FBFB64906B59B08"/>ſtate of health, and the poſſible hazard of a long minority, will wiſh to ſee the family-eſtate free and unincumbered<note n="*" place="bottom">Every true friend of the houſe of Brunſwick ſees with affliction, how rapidly ſome of the principal branches of the family have dropped off.</note>.

Whatever ſtyle of contempt may be adopted by miniſters or Parliaments, no man ſincerely deſpiſes the voice of the Engliſh nation. The Houſe of Commons are only interpreters, whoſe duty it is to convey the ſenſe of the people faithfully to the crown. If the interpretation be falſe or imperfect, the conſtituent powers are called upon to deliver their own ſentiments.

               <p>WHILE Parliament was ſitting, it would neither have been ſafe, nor perhaps quite regular to offer any opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to the public, upon the juſtice or wiſdom of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings. To pronounce fairly upon their conduct, it was neceſſary to wait until we could conſider, in one view, the beginning, progreſs, and concluſion of their deliberations. The cauſe of the public was undertaken and ſupported by men, whoſe abilities and united authority, to ſay nothing of the
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:023477_0160_0FBFB64AB7D57118"/>advantageous ground they ſtood on, might well be thought ſufficient to determine a popular queſtion in favour of the people. Neither was the Houſe of Commons ſo abſolately engaged in defence of the miniſtry, or even of their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, but that <hi>they</hi> might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> paid ſome decent regard to the known diſpoſition of their conſtituents; and, without any diſhonour to their firmneſs, might have retracted an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion too haſtily adopted, when they ſaw the alarm it had created, and how ſtrongly it was oppoſed by the general ſenſe of the nation. The miniſtry too would have conſulted their own immediate intereſt, in making ſome conceſſion ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the moderate part of the people. Without touching the fact, they might have conſented to guard againſt or give up the dangerous principle on which it was eſtabliſhed. In this ſtate of things, I think it was highly improbable at the beginning of the ſeſſion, that the complaints of the people upon a matter which, in <hi>their</hi> apprehenſion at leaſt, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately affected the life of the conſtitution, would be treated with as much contempt by their own repreſentatives, and by the Houſe of Lords, as they had been by the other branch of the legiſlature. Deſpairing of their integrity, we had a right to expect ſomething from their prudence, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from their fears. The Duke of Grafton certainly did not foreſee to what an extent the corruption of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>The prorogation of Parliament naturally calls upon us to review their proceedings, and to conſider the condition in which they have left the kingdom. I do not question but they have done what is uſually called the King's buſineſs, much to his Majeſty's ſatisfaction. We have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

The interval between the opening of the laſt, and cloſe of the former ſeſſion, was longer than uſual. Whoever were the views of the miniſter in deferring the meeting of Parliament,
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:023477_0161_0FBFB64D2A79B3F8"/>ſufficient time was certainly given to every member of the Houſe of Commons, to look back upon the ſteps he had tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, and the conſequences they had produced. The zeal of party, the violence of perſonal animoſities, and the heat of convention, had leiſure to ſubſide. From that period, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever reſolution they took was deliberate and prepenſe. In the preceding ſeſſion, the dependants of the miniſtry had affected to believe, that the final determination of the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would have ſatisfied the nation, or at leaſt put a ſtop to their complaints; as if the certainty of an evil could dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the ſenſe of it, or the nature of injuſtice be altered by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. But they found the people of England were in a temper very diſtant from ſubmiſſion; and, although it was contended that the Houſe of Commons could not themſelves reverſe a reſolution, which had the force and effect of a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial ſentence, there were other conſtitutional expedients, which would have given a ſecurity againſt any ſimilar at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts for the future. The general propoſition, in which the whole country had an intereſt, might have been reduced to a particular fact, in which Mr. Wilkes and Mr. Luttrell would alone have been concerned. The Houſe of Lords might interpoſe;—the King might diſſolve the Parliament; or, if every other reſource failed, there ſtill lay a grand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional writ of error, in behalf of the people, from the deciſion of one court to the wiſdom of the whole legiſlature. Every one of theſe remedies has been ſucceſſively attempted. The people performed <hi>their</hi> part with dignity, ſpirit, and perſeverence. For many months his Majeſty board nothing from his people but the language of complaint and reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; —unhappily for this country, it was the daily tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph of his courtiers that he heard it with an indifference approaching to contempt.</p>
               <p>The Houſe of Commons having aſſumed a power unknown to the conſtitution, were determined not merely to ſupport it in the ſingle inſtance in queſtion, but to maintain the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine in its utmoſt extent, and to eſtabliſh the fact as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent in law, to be applied in whatever manner his Majeſty's ſervants ſhould hereafter think fit. Their proceedings upon this occaſion are a ſtrong proof that a deciſion, in the firſt inſtance illegal and unjuſt, can only be ſupported by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuation of falſehood and injuſtice. To ſupport their form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reſolutions, they were obliged to violate ſome of the beſt

The arbitrary power they have aſſumed of impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fines, and committing during pleaſure, will now be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in its full extent. The Houſe of Commons are too much in their debt to queſtion or interrupt their proceedings. The crown too, we may be well aſſured, will loſe nothing in this new diſtribution of power. After declaring, that to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for a diſſolution of Parliaments is irreconcileable with the principles of the conſtitution, his Majeſty has reaſon to expect that ſome extraordinary compliment will be returned to the royal prerogative.

               <p>Through the whole proceedings of the Houſe of Commons in this ſeſſion, there is an apparent, a palpable conſciouſneſs of guilt, which has prevented their daring to aſſert their own dignity, where it has been immediately and groſsly attacked.

Doctor Maſgrave, with no other ſupport but truth and his own firmneſs, reſiſted and overcame the whole Houſe of Commons.</note>. The terms, in which the ſale of a patent to Mr. Hine was communicated to the public, naturally called for a parliamentary inquiry. The integrity of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons was directly impeached; but they had not courage to more in their own vindication, becauſe the inquity would have been fatal to Colonel Burgoyne and the Duke of Graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.

Why did they not immediately expel thoſe refractory members? Conſcious of the motives on which they had acted, they prudently preferred infamy to danger; and were better prepared to meet the contempt, than to rouſe the indignation, of the whole people. Had they expelled thoſe five members, the conſequences of the new doctrine of incapacitation would have come immediatly home to every man. The truth of it would then have been fairly tried, without any reference to Mr. Wilkes's private character, or the dignity of the houſe, or the obſtinacy of one particular county. Theſe topics, I know, have had their weight with men, who, affecting a character of moderation, in reality conſult nothing but their own immediate eaſe;—who are weak enough to acquieſce under a flagrant violation of the laws, when it does not directly touch themſelves; and care not what injuſtice is practiſed upon a man, whoſe moral cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter they piouſly think themſelves obliged to condemn. In any other circumſtances, the Houſe of Commons muſt have forfeited all credit and dignity, if, after ſuch groſs provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they had permitted thoſe five gentlemen to ſit any long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er among them. We ſhould then have ſeen and felt the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a precedent, which is repreſented to be perfectly barren and harmleſs. But there is a ſet of men in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, whoſe underſtandings meaſure the violation of law by the magnitude of the inſtance, not by the important conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which flow directly from the principle; and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:023477_0165_0FBFB65CDEC03910"/>I preſume, did not think it ſafe to quicken their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions too ſoon. Had Mr. Hampden reaſoned and acted like the moderate men of theſe days, inſtead of hazarding his whole fortune in a law-ſuit with the crown, he would have quietly paid the twenty ſhillings demanded of him:—the Stuart family would probably have continued upon the throne, and at this moment the impoſition of ſhip-money would have been an acknowledged prerogative of the crown.</p>
               <p>What then has been the buſineſs of the ſeſſion, after voting the ſupplies, and confirming the determination of the Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex election? The extraordinary prorogation of the Iriſh Parliament, and the juſt diſcontents of that kingdom, have been paſſed by without notice. Neither the general ſituation of our colonies, nor that particular diſtreſs which forced the inhabitants of Boſton to take up arms in their defence, have been thought worthy of a moment's conſideration. In the repeal of thoſe acts which were moſt offenſive to America, the Parliament have done every thing but remove the offence. They have reliquiſhed the revenue, but judiciouſly takes care to preſerve the contention. It is not pretended that the continuation of the tea-duty is to produce any direct benefit whatſoever to the mother-country. What is it then but an odious unprofitable exertion of a ſpeculative right, and fixing a badge of ſlavery upon the Americans, without ſervice to their maſters? But it has pleaſed God to give us a Miniſtry and a Parliament, who are neither to be perſuaded by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment nor inſtructed by experience.</p>
               <p>Lord North, I preſume, will not claim an extraordinary merit from any thing he has done this year in the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or application of the revenue. A great operation, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to an important object, though it ſhould fail of ſucceſs, marks the genius and elevates the character of a miniſter. A poor contracted underſtanding deals in little ſchemes, which diſhonour him if they fail, and do him no credit when they ſucceed. Lord North had fortunately the means in his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of reducing all the four <hi>percents</hi> at once. The failure of his firſt enterprize in finance, is not half ſo diſgraceful to his reputation as a miniſter, as the enterprize itſelf is injurious to the public. Inſtead of ſtriking one deciſive blow, which would have cleared the market at once, upon terms propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the price of the four <hi>percents</hi> ſix weeks ago, he has tampered with a pitiful portion of a commodity, which ought
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:023477_0166_0FBFB65E611C8C18"/>never to have been touched but in groſs:—he has given no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the holders of that ſtock, of a deſign formed by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to prevail upon them to ſurrender it by degrees, conſequently has warned them to hold up and enhance the price:—ſo that the plan of reducing the four <hi>per cents</hi> muſt either he dropped entirely, or continued with an increaſing diſadvantage to the public. The miniſter's ſagacity has ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to raiſe the value of the thing he means to purchaſe, and to ſink that of the three <hi>percents,</hi> which it is his purpoſe to fell. In effect, he has contrived to make it the intereſt of the proprietor of four <hi>percents</hi> to ſell out, and buy three <hi>percents</hi> in the market, rather than ſubſcribe his ſtock upon any terms that can poſſibly be offered by government.</p>

Edward, and Richard the Second, made the ſame diſtinction between the collective body of the people, and a contemptible party who ſurrounded the throne. The event of their miſtaken
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:023477_0167_0FBFB6601158F2D0"/>conduct might have been a warning to their ſucceſſors. Yet the errors of thoſe princes were not without excuſe. They had as many falſe friends as our preſent gracious Sovereign, and infinitely greater temptations to ſeduce them. They were neither ſober, religious, nor demure. Intoxicated with pleaſure, they waſted their inheritance in purſuit of it. Their lives were like a rapid torrent, brilliant in proſpect, though uſeleſs or dangerous in its courſe. In the dull, unanimated exiſtence of other princes, we ſee nothing but a ſickly ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant water, which taints the atmoſphere without ſerializing the ſoil. The morality of a king is not to be meaſured by vulgar rules. His ſituation is ſingular. There are faults which do him honour, and virtues that diſgrace him. A faultleſs inſipid equality in his character, is neither capable of vice nor virtue in the extreme; but it ſecures his ſubmiſſion to thoſe perſons whom he has been accuſtomed to reſpect, and makes him a dangerous inſtrument of <hi>their</hi> ambitions. Secluded from the world, attached from his infancy to one ſet of perſons and one ſet of ideas, he can neither open his heart to new connections, nor his mind to better information. A character of this ſort is the ſoil fitteſt to produce that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate bigotry in politics and religion, which begins with a meritorious ſacrifice of the underſtanding, and finally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts the monarch and the martyr to the block.</p>
               <p>At any other period, I doubt not, the ſcandalous diſorders which have been introduced into the government of all the dependencies in the empire, would have rouſed the attention of the public. The odious abuſe and proſtitution of the prerogative at home,—the unconſtitutional employment of the military,—the arbitrary fines and commitments by the Houſe of Lords, and court of King's-bench;—the mercy of a chaſte and pious prince, extended cheerfully to a wilful murderer, becauſe that murderer is the brother of a common proſtitute<note n="*" place="bottom">Miſs Kennedy.</note>, would, I think, at any other time, have excited univerſal indignation. But the daring attack upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, in the Middleſex election, makes us callous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to inderior grievances. No man regards an erupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon the ſurface, when the noble parts are invaded, and he feels a mortification approaching to his heart.

               <p>MR. Luttrell's ſervices were the chief ſupport and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Duke of Grafton's adminiſtration. The honour of rewarding them was reſerved for your Lordſhip. The Duke, it ſeems, had contracted an obligation he was aſhamed to acknowledge, and unable to acquit. You, my Lord, had no ſcruples. You accepted the ſucceſſion with all its incumbrances; and have paid Mr. Luttrell his legacy, at the hazard of ruining the eſtate.</p>
               <p>When this accompliſhed youth declared himſelf the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion of government, the world was buſy in inquiring what honours or emoluments could be a ſufficient recompence to a young man of his rank and fortune, for ſubmitting to mark his entrance into life with the univerſal contempt and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of his country.—His noble father had not been ſo precipitate.—To vacate his ſeat in Parliament,—to intrude upon a country in which he had no intereſt or connection,— to poſſeſs himſelf of another man's right, and to maintain it in defiance of public ſhame as well as juſtice, beſpoke a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of zeal, or of depravity, which all the favour of a pious prince could hardly requite. I proteſt, my Lord, there is in this young man's conduct, a ſtrain of proſtitution, which, for its ſingularity, I cannot but admire. He has diſcovered a new line in the human character;—he has degraded even the name of Luttrell, and gratified his father's moſt ſanguine expectations.</p>
               <p>The Duke of Grafton, with every poſſible diſpoſition to patronize this kind of merit, was contented with pronouncing Colonel Luttrell's panegyric. The gallant ſpirit, the diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted zeal of the young adventurer, were echoed through
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:023477_0169_0FBFB66D09709488"/>the Houſe of Lords. His Grace repeatedly pledged himſelf to the houſe, as an evidence of the purity of his friend Mr. Luttrell's intentions;—that he had engaged without any proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of perſonal benefit, and that the idea of compenſation would mortally offend him<note n="*" place="bottom">He now ſays that his chief object is the rank of colonel, and that he <hi>will</hi> have it.</note>. The noble Duke could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be in earneſt; but he had lately quitted his employment, and began to think it neceſſary to take ſome care of his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. At that very moment the Iriſh negociation was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably begun.—Come forward, thou worthy repreſentative of Lord Bute, and tell this inſulted country, who adviſed the King to appoint Mr. Luttrell ADJUTANT-GENERAL to the army in Ireland? By what management was Colonel Cuning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hame prevailed on to reſign his employment, and the obſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quious Giſborne to accept a penſion for the government of Kinſale<note n="†" place="bottom">This infamous tranſaction ought to be explained to the public. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Giſborne was quarter-mather-general in Ireland. Lord Townſhend perſuades him to reſign to a Scotch officer, one Fraſer, and gives him the government of Kinſale.—Colonel Couninghame was adjutant-general in Ireland. Lord Townſhend offers him a penſion to induce him to reſign to Luttrell. Cuninghame treats the offer with contempt. What's to be done? Poor Giſborne muſt more once more.—He accepts of a penſion of 500 <abbr>l.</abbr> a year, until a government of greater value ſhall become vacant. Colonel Cuninghame is made governor of Kinſale: and Luttrell, at laſt, from whom the whole machinery is put in motion, becomes adjutant-general, and is effect takes the command of the army in Ireland.</note>? Was it an original ſtipulation with the Princeſs of Wales, or does he owe his preferment to your Lordſhip's partiality, or to the Duke of Bedford's friendſhip? My Lord, though it may not be poſſible to trace this meaſure to its ſource, we can follow the ſtream, and warn the country of its approaching diſtruction. The Engliſh nation muſt be rouſed, and put upon its guard. Mr. Luttrell has already ſhewn us how far he may be truſted, whenever an open attack is to be made upon the liberties of this country. I do not doubt that there is a deliberate plan formed.—Your Lordſhip beſt knows by whom;—the corruption of the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative body on this ſide—a military force on the other— and then, <hi>Farewell to England!</hi> It is impoſſible that any miniſter ſhall dare to adviſe the King to place ſuch a man as Luttrell in the confidential poſt of adjutant-general, if there were not ſome ſecret purpoſe in view, which only ſuch a
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:023477_0170_0FBFB6726A2A5790"/>man as Luttrell is fit to promote. The inſult offered to the army in general, is as groſs as the cutrage intended to the people of England.

With him you might have ſhared in the honour of the Pretender's confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence—with him you might have preſerved the integrity of your character; and England. I think, might have ſpared you without regret. Your friends will ſay, perhaps, that although you deſerted the fortune of your liege Lord, you have adhered firmly to the principles which drove his father from the throne:—that, without openly ſupporting the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, you have done eſſential ſervice to the cauſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoled yourſelf for the loſs of a favourite family, by reviving and eſtabliſhing the maxims of their government. This is
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:023477_0172_0FBFB675A40EE948"/>the way in which a Scotchman's underſtanding corrects the errors of his heart. My Lord, I acknowledge the truth of the defence, and can trace it through all your conduct. I ſee through your whole life one uniform plan to enlarge the power of the crown, at the expence of the liberty of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. To this object, your thoughts, words, and actions, have been conſtantly directed. In contempt or ignorance of the common law of England, you have made it your ſtudy to introduce into the court where you preſide, maxims of juriſprudence unknown to Engliſhmen. The Roman code, the law of nations, and the opinion of foreign civilians, are your perpetual theme;—but who ever heard you mention Magna Charta, or the Bill of Rights, with approbation or reſpect? By ſuch treacherous arts, the noble ſimplicity and free ſpirit of our Saxon laws were firſt corrupted. The Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man conqueſt was not complete, until Norman lawyers had introduced their laws, and reduced ſlavery to a ſyſtem. This one leading principle directs your interpretation of the laws, and accounts for your treatment of juries. It is not in poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical queſtions only, (for there the courtier might be forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en;) but, let the caſe be what it may, your underſtanding is equally on the rack, either to contract the power of the jury, or to miſlead their judgment. For the truth of this aſſertion, I appeal to the doctrine you delivered in Lord Groſvenor's cauſe. An action for criminal converſation being brought by a peer againſt a prince of the blood, you were daring enough to tell the jury, that, in fixing the damages, they were to pay no regard to the quality or fortune of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;—that it was a trial between A and B;—that they were to conſider the offence in a moral light only, and give no greater damages to a peer of the realm than to the meaneſt mechanic. I ſhall not attempt to refute a doctrine which, if it was meant for law, carries falſehood and abſurdity upon the face of it; but if it was meant for a declaration of your po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical creed, is clear and conſiſtent. Under an arbitrary go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, all ranks and diſtinctions are confounded. The honour of a nobleman is no more conſidered than the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> and inclination to depart from the deciſions of your prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, which you certainly ought to receive as evidence of
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:023477_0173_0FBFB6773AA69E30"/>the common law. Inſtead of thoſe certain poſitive rules by which the judgment of a court of law ſhould invariably be determined, you have fondly introduced your own unſettled notions of equity and ſubſtantial juſtice. Deciſions give up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch principles do not alarm the public ſo much as they ought, becauſe the conſequence and tendency of each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular inſtance is not obſerved or regarded. In the mean time, the practice gains ground; the court of King's-bench becomes a court of equity; and the judge, inſtead of conſulting ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the law of the land, refers only to the wiſdom of the court, and to the purity of his own conſcience. The name of Mr. Juſtice Yates will naturally revive in your mind ſome of thoſe emotions of fear and deteſtation with which you always be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held him. That great lawyer, that honeſt man, ſaw your whole conduct in the light that I do. After years of ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual reſiſtance to the pernicious principles introduced by your Lordſhip, and uniformly ſupported by your <hi>humble friends</hi> upon the bench, he determined to quit a court whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings and deciſions he could neither aſſent to with honour, nor oppoſe with ſucceſs.</p>

               <p>The doctrine you have conſtantly delivered in caſes of libel, is another powerful evidence of a ſettled plan to contract the legal power of juries, and to draw queſtions, in ſeparable from fact, within the <hi>arbitrium</hi> of the court.

In ſome inſtances you have ſucceeded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe jurymen are too often ignorant of their own rights, and too apt to be awed by the authority of a chief-juſtice.

                  </gap> the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of that crown which his predeceſſors have worn with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. Theſe are ſtrong terms, Sir, but they are ſupported by fact and argument.</p>
               <p>The King of Great-Britain had been for ſome years in poſſeſſion of an iſland, to which, as the miniſtry themſelves have repeatedly aſſerted, the Spaniards had no claim of right, The importance of the place is not in queſtion. If it were, a better judgment might be formed of it from the opinion of Lord Anſon and Lord Egmont, and from the anxiety of the Spaniards, than from any fallacious inſinuations thrown out by men whoſe intereſt it is to undervalue that property which they are determined to relinquiſh. The pretenſions of Spain were a ſubject of negociation between the two cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s. They had been diſcuſſed, but not admitted. The King of Spain, in theſe circumſtances, bids adieu to amicable negociation, and appeals directly to the ſword. The expedition againſt Port-Egmont does not appear to have been a ſudden ill-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed enterpriſe. It ſeems to have been conducted not only with the uſual military precautions, but in all the forms and ceremonies of war. A frigate was firſt employed to examine the ſtrength of the place. A meſſage was then ſent, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediate poſſeſſion, in the Catholic King's name, and ordering our people to depart. At laſt a military force ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, and compels the garriſon to ſurrender. A formal ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulation enſues; and his Majeſty's ſhip, which might at leaſt have been permitted to bring home his troops immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, is detained in port twenty days, and her rudder forcibly taken away. This train of facts carries no appearance of the raſhneſs or violence of a Spaniſh governor. On the contrary, the whole plan ſeems to have been formed and executed, in conſequence of deliberate orders and a regular inſtruction from the Spaniſh court. Mr. Buccarelli is not a pirate nor has he
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:023477_0181_0FBFB68F66E21618"/>been treated as ſuch by thoſe who employed him. I feel for the honour of a gentleman, when I affirm, that our King owes him a ſignal reparation.—Where will the humiliation of this country end? A King of Great-Britain, not content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with placing himſelf upon a level with a Spaniſh governor, deſcends ſo low as to do a notorious injuſtice to that governor. As a ſalvo for his own reputation, he has been adviſed to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the character of a brave officer, and to treat him as a common robber, when he know with certainty that Mr. Buc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carelli had acted in obedience to his orders, and had done no more than his duty. Thus it happens in private life, with a man who has no ſpirit not ſenſe of honour. One of his equals orders a ſervant to ſtrike him. Inſtead of returning the how to the maſter, his courage is contented with throwing an aſperſion, equally falſe and public, upon the character of the ſervant.</p>
               <p>This ſhort recapitulation was neceſſary to introduce the conſideration of his Majeſty's ſpeech of the 13th November 1770, and the ſubſequent meaſures of government. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive caution with which the ſpeech was drawn up, had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed upon me an early conviction, that no ferious reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was thought of, and that the concluſion of the buſineſs, whenever it happened, muſt in ſome degree be diſhonourable to England. There appears through the whole ſpeech a gnard and reſerve in the choice of expreſſion, which ſhows how careful the miniſtry were not to embarraſs their future pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects by any firm or ſpirited declaration from the throne. When all hopes of peace are loſt, his Majeſty tells his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that he is preparing—not for barbarous war, but (with all his mother's ſoftneſs) <hi>for a different ſituation.</hi>—An open hoſtility, authoriſed by the Catholic King, is called <hi>an act of a governor.</hi> This act, to avoid the mention of a regular ſiege and ſurrender, paſſes under the piratical deſcription of <hi>ſeizing by force;</hi> and the thing taken is deſcribed, not as a part of the King's territory or proper dominion, but merely as a <hi>poſſeſſion,</hi> a word expreſsly choſen in contradiſtinction to and excluſion of the idea of <hi>right,</hi> and to prepare us for a future] ſurrender both of the right and of the poſſeſſion. Yet this ſpeech, Sir, cautious and equivocal as it is, cannot, by any ſophiſtry, be accommodated to the meaſures which have ſince been adopted. It ſeemed to promiſe, that whatever might be given up by ſecret ſtipulation, ſome care would be taken to

                  </gap>e appearances to the public. The event ſhows us, that to depart, in the minuteſt article, from the nicety and ſtrictneſs of punctilio, is as dangerous to national honour as to female virtue. The woman, who admits of one familiarity, ſeldom knows where to ſtop, or what to refuſe; and when the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of a great country give way in a ſingle inſtance,—when they once are inclined to ſubmiſſion, every ſtep accelerates the rapidity of the deſcent. The miniſtry themſelves, when they framed the ſpeech, did not foreſee, that they ſhould ever accede to ſuch an accommodation as they have ſince ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed their Maſter to accept of.</p>
               <p>The King ſays. <hi>The honour of my crown and the rights of my people are deeply affected.</hi> The Spaniard, in his reply, ſays, <hi>I give you back poſſeſſion; but I adhere to my claim of prior right, reſerving the aſſertion of it for a more favourable opportunity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſpeech ſays, <hi>I made an immediate demand of ſatisfaction; and, if that fails, I am prepared to do myſelf juſtice.</hi> This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate demand muſt have been ſent to Madrid on the 12th of September, or in a few days after. It was certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, or evaded, and the King has not done himſelf juſtice. When the firſt Magiſtrate ſpeaks to the nation, ſome care ſhould be taken of his apparent veracity.</p>
               <p>The ſpeech proceeds to ſay, <hi>I ſhall not diſcontinue my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations until I have received people reparation for the injury.</hi> If this aſſurance may be relied on, what an enormous expense is entailed, <hi>ſine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> upon this unhappy country! Reſtitution of a poſſeſſion, and reparation of an injury, are as different in ſubſtance as they are in language. The very act of reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution may contain, as in this inſtance it palpably does, a ſhameful aggravation of the injury. A man of ſpirit does not meaſure the degree of an injury by the mere poſitive da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage he has ſuſtained. He conſiders the principle on which it is founded; he reſents the ſuperiority aſſerted over him; and rejects with indignation the claim of right, which his adverſary endeavours to eſtabliſh, and would force him to acknowledge.</p>
               <p>The motives on which the Catholic King makes reſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, are, if poſſible, more inſolent and diſgraceful to our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign than even the declaratory condition annexed to it. After taking four months to conſider whether the expedition was undertaken by his own orders or not, he condeſcends to diſavow the enterpriſe, and to reſtore the iſland;—not from
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:023477_0183_0FBFB69BD183A868"/>any regard to juſtice,—not from any regard he bears to his Britannic Majeſty; but merely <hi>from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

But why this unſeaſonable, this ridiculoes meantion of the King of Great-Britain's pacific intentions? Have they eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

No, Sir; if any ideas of ſtrife of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility have catered his Royal mind, they have a very different direction. The enemies of England have nothing to fear from them.</p>
               <p>After all, Sir, to what kind of diſavowal has the King of Spain at laſt conſemed? Suppoſing it made in proper time, it ſhould have been accompanied with inſtant reſtitution; and, if, Mr. Buccarelli acted without orders, be deſerved death.

The King of France's preſent averſion from war, and the diſtraction of his affairs, are notorious. He is now in a ſtate of war with his people. In vain did the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic King ſolicit him to take part in the quarrel againſt us. His finances were in the laſt diſorder, and it was probable that his troops might find ſufficient employment at home. In theſe circumſtances, we might have dictated the law to Spain. There are no terms to which ſhe might not have been compelled to ſubmit. At the worſt, a war with Spain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

The advantage is thrown away. The moſt favourable opportunity is loſt.—Hereaſter we ſhall know the value of it. When the French King is reconciled to his ſubjects; when Spain has completed her preparations;

A clear unblemiſhed character comprehends, not only the integrity that will not offer, but the ſpirit that will not ſubmit to, and injury; and whether it belongs to an individual or to a community, it is the foundation of peace, of independence, and of ſafety.

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  <date>FEBRUARY 6, 1771.</date>

               <p>I HOPE your correſpondent <hi>Junius</hi> is better employed than in anſwering or reading the criticiſms of a newſpaper. This is a taſk from which, if he were inclined to ſubmit to it, his friends ought to relieve him. Upon this principle I ſhall undertake to anſwer Anti-Junius; more, I believe, to hid conviction than to his ſatisfaction. Not daring to attack the main body of <hi>Junius</hi>'s laſt letter, he triumphs in having, as he thinks, ſurpriſed an out-poſt. and cut off a detached ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, a mere ſtraggling propoſition. But even in this petty warfare he ſhall find himſelf defeated.</p>
               <p>Junius does not ſpeak of the Spaniſh <hi>nation as</hi> the <hi>natural <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> of England. He applies that deſcription, with the ſtricteſt truth and juſtice, to the Spaniſh <hi>Court.</hi> From the moment when a prince of the houſe of Bourbon aſcended that throne, their whole ſyſtem of governments was inverted, and became hoſtile to this country. Unity of poſſeſſion introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an unity of politice; and Lew is the Fourteenth had reaſon when he ſaid to his grandſon, <hi>"The Pyrekees are removed."</hi> The hiſtory of the preſent century is one continued confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the prophecy.</p>
               <p>The aſſertion, <q>
                     <hi>That violence and oppreſſion at home can <g ref="char:startq">“</g>
                        <g ref="char:endq">”</g>only be ſupported by treachery and ſubmiſſion abroad,</hi>
                  </q> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to a free people whoſe rights are invaded, not to the government of a country where deſpotic or abſolute power is confeſſedly veſted in the prince; and with this application, the affertion is true. An abſolute monarch, having no points to carry at home, will naturally maintain the honour of his crown in all his tranſactions with foreign powers: But if we could ſuppoſe the Sovereign of a free nation poſſeſſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> a deſign to make himſelf abſolute, he would be inconſiſtent with himſelf, if he ſuffered his projects to be interrupted or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> caſes it might, to promote his principal deſign. Of the three exceptions to this general rule of conduct, (quoted by Anti-Junius). that of Oliver Cromwell is the only one in polar Harry the Eighth, by the ſubmiſſion of his Parliament, was
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:023477_0187_0FBFB6A19C8A84C0"/>as abolute a prince as Lewis the fourteenth. Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth's government was not oppreſſive to the people, and as to her foreign wars, it ought to be conſidered that they were <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">

                     </gap>dable.</hi> The national honour was not in queſtion. She was compelled to fight in defence of her own perſon and of her title to the crown. In the common cauſe of ſelfiſh policy. Oliver Cromwell ſhould have cultivated the friendſhip of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign powers, or at leaſt have avoided diſputes with them, the better to eſtabliſh his tyranny at home. Had be been only a bad man, he would have ſacrificed the honour of the nation to the ſucceſs of his domeſiic policy. But, with all his crimes, he had the ſpirit of an Engliſhman. The conduct of ſuch a man muſt always be an exception to vulgar take. He had abilities ſufficient to reconcile contradictions, and to make a great nation at the ſame moment unhappy and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable. If it were not for the reſpect I bear the miniſter, I could name a man, who, without one grain of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, can do half as much as Oliver Cromwell.</p>
               <p>Whether or no there be a <hi>ſecret ſyſtem</hi> in the cloſet, and what may be the object of it, are queſtions which can only be determined by appearances, and on which every man moſt decide for himſelf.</p>
               <p>The whole plan of <hi>Junius</hi>'s letter proves, that he himſelf makes no diſtinction between the real honour of the crown and the real intereſt of the people. In the climax to which your correſpondent objects, <hi>Junius</hi> adopts the language of the Court, and by that comformity gives ſtrength to his argument. He ſays, that <q>
                     <hi>the King has not eely ſcarificed the intereſts of <g ref="char:startq">“</g>the people, but</hi> (what was likely to touch him more nearly) <g ref="char:endq">”</g>
                     <hi>his perſonal reputation and the dignity of his crown.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The queries put by <hi>Anti-Junius</hi> can only be anſwered by the miniſtry. Abandoned as they are, I fancy they will not confeſs that they have, for ſo many years, maintained poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of another man's property, After admitting the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion of the miniſtry, viz. <hi>That the Spaniards had no right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful claim,</hi> and after juſtifying them for ſaying ſo; it is <hi>his</hi> buſineſſ not <hi>mine,</hi> to give us ſome good reaſon for their <hi>ſuffering <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>he pretenſion of Spain to be a ſubject of negotiation.</hi> He admits the facts;—let him reconcile them if he can.</p>
               <p>The laſt paragraph brings us back to the original queſtion. Whether the Spaniſh declaration contains ſuch a ſatistaction as the King of Great-Britain ought to have accepted. This
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:023477_0188_0FBFB6A82923B918"/>was the field upon which he ought to have countered <hi>Junius</hi> openly and fairly. But here he leaves the argument, as no longer defenſible. I ſhall therefore conclude with one gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral admonition to my fellow-ſubjects:—That when they hear theſe matters debated, they ſhould not ſuffer themſelves to be miſled by general declamations upon the conveniencies of peace, or the miſeries of war. Between peace an was, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractedly, there is not, there cannot, be a queſtion in the mind of a rational being. The real queſtions are, <hi>Have we any ſecurity that the peace we have ſo dearly purchaſed will laſt a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  <salute>SIR.</salute>

               <p>TO write for profit, without taxing the preſs;—to write for fame, and to be unknown;—to ſupport the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of faction, and to be diſowned, as a dangerous auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary, by every party in the kingdom; are contradictions which the miniſter muſt reconcile. before I forfeit my credit with the public. I may quit the ſervice, but it would be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to ſuſpect me of deſertion. The deputation of theſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers is an honourable pledge for my attachment to the people. To ſacrifice a reſpected character, and to renounce the eſteem of ſociety, requires more than Mr. Wecklerburne's reſolution; and though in him it was rather a profeſſion than a deſertion of his principles, (I ſpeak tenderly of his gentleman, for when treachery is in queſtion, I think we ſhould make al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances for a Scotchman), yet we have ſeen him in the Houſe of Commons overwhelmed with confuſion, and almoſt bereft of his faculties.—But in truth, Sir, I have left no room for an accommodation with the piety of St. James's. My eſſences are not to be redeemed by recantation or repentance. On one ſide, our warmeſt patriots would diſclaim me as a burden to their honeſt ambition. On the other, the vileſt
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:023477_0189_0FBFB6AB1EDC8B10"/>proſtitution, if <hi>Junius</hi> could deſcend to it. would loſe its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural merit and influence in the cabinet, and treachery be no longer a recommendation ſo the royal favour.</p>
               <p>The perſons who, till within theſe few years, have been moſt diſtinguiſhed by their zeal for high-church and preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. are now, it ſeems, the great aſſertors of the privileges of the Houſe of Commons. This ſudden alteration of their ſentiments or language carries with it a ſuſpicious appearance. When I hear the undefined privileges of the popular branch of the legiſlature exalted by tories and jacobites, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of thoſe ſtrict rights, which are known to the ſubject, and limited by the laws, I cannot but ſuſpect, that ſubject, chievous ſcheme is in agitation, to deſtroy both law and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, by oppoſing them to each other. They who have uniformly denied the power of the whole legiſlature to alter the deſcent of the crown, and whoſe anceſtors, in rebellion againſt his Majeſty's family, have defended that doctrine at the hazard of their lives, now tell us, that privilege of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is the only rule of right, and the chief ſecurity of the public freedom.—I fear, Sir, that while forms remain, there has been ſome material change in the ſubſtance of our conſtitution. The opinions of theſe men were too abſurd to be ſo eaſily renounced. Liberal minds are open to convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—Liberal doctrines are capable of improvement.—There are proſelytes from atheiſm, but none from ſuperſtition.— If their preſent profeſſions were ſincere, I think they could not but be highly offended at ſeeing a queſtion, concerning parliamentary privilege, unneceſſarily ſtarted at a ſeaſon ſo unfavourable to the Houſe of Commons, and by ſo very mean and inſignificant a perſon as the minor <hi>Onſlow.</hi> They knew, that the preſent Houſe of Commons, having commenced hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilities with the people, and degraded the authority of the laws by their own example, were likely enough to be reſiſted <hi>per fas et nefas.</hi> If they were really friends to privilege, they would have thought the queſtion of right too dangerous to be hazarded at this ſeaſon, and, without the formality of a convention, would have left it undecided.</p>
               <p>I have been ſilent hitherto; though not from that ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful indifference about the intereſts of ſociety which too many of us proſeſs, and call moderation. I confeſs, Sir, that I felt the prejudices of my education, in favour of a Houſe of Commons, ſtill hanging about me. I thought that a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:023477_0190_0FBFB6B333037A90"/>between law and privilege, could never he brought to a formal deciſion, without inconvenience to the public ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, or a manifeſt dimiration of legal liberty;—that it ought therefore to be canfully avoided: and when I ſaw that the violence of the Houſe of Commons had carried them too far to retreat, I determined not to deliver a haſty opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon a matter of ſo much delicacy and importance.</p>
               <p>The ſtate of things is much altered in this country ſince it was neceſſary to protect our repreſentatives againſt the direct power of the crown. We have nothings to apprehend from prerogative, but every thing from undue influence. Former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it was the intereſt of the people, that the privileges of Parliament ſhould be left unlimited and undefined. At pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, it is not only their intereſt, but I hold it to he effenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally neceſſary to the preſervation of the conſtitution, that the privileges of Parliament ſhould be ſtrictly aſcertained, and confined whithin the narroweſt bounds the nature of their inſtitution will admit of. Upon the ſame principle on which I would have reſiſted prerogative in the laſt century, I now reſiſt privilege. It is indifferent to me, whether the crown, by its own immediate act, impoſes new, and diſpenſes with old laws; or whether are ſame arbitrary power produces the ſame effects through the medium of the Houſe of Commons. We truſted our repreſentatives with privileges for their own defence and ours. We cannot hinder their deſertion, but we can prevent their carrying over their arms to the ſervice of the enemy. It will be ſaid, that I begin with endeavouring to reduce the argument concerning privilege to a mere queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of convenience;—that I deny at one moment what I would allow at another; and that to reſiſt the power of a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituted Houſe of Commons, may eſtabliſh a precedent inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to all future Parliaments.—To this I anſwer generally, that human affairs are in no inſtance governed by ſtrict poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive right. If change of circumſtances were to have no weight in directing our conduct and opinions, the mutual intercourſe of mankind would be nothing more than a contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween poſitive and equitable right. Society would be a ſtate of war, and law itſelf would be injuſtice. On this general ground, it is highly reaſonable that the degree of our ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to privileges which have never been defined by any poſitive law, ſhould be conſidered as a queſtion of convenience, and proportioned to the confidence we repoſe in the integrity of
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:023477_0191_0FBFB6B4A97480C8"/>our repreſentatives. As to the injury we may do to any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and more reſpectable Houſe of Commons, I own I am not now ſanguine enough to expect a more plentiful harveſt of plarliamentary virtue in one year than another. Our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical climate is ſeverely altered; and without dwelling upon the depravity of modern times, I think no reaſonable man will expect, that, as human nature is conſtituted, the enormous in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>luence of the crown ſhould ceaſe to prevail over the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of individuals. The miſchief lies too deep to be cared by any remedy, leſs than ſome great convulſion, which may either carry back the conſtitution to its original principles, or utterly deſtroy it. I do not doubt, that, in the firſt ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion after the next election, ſome popular meaſures may be adopted. The preſent Houſe of Commons have injured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by a too early and public profeſſion of their principles; and if a ſtrain of proſtitution, which had no example, were within the reach of emulation, it might be imprudent to hazard the experiment too ſoon. But, after all, Sir, it is very immaterial whether a Houſe of Commons ſhall preſerve their virtue for a week, a month, or a year. The influence, which makes a ſeptennial Parliament dependent upon the pleaſure of the crown, has a permanent operation, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not fail of ſucceſs.—My premiſes, I know, will be denied in argument; but every man's conſcience tells him they are true. It remains then to be conſidered, whether it be for the intereſt of the people, that privilege of Parliament (which<note n="*" place="bottom">The neceſſity of ſecuring the Houſe of Commons againſt the King's power, ſo that no interruption might be given either to the attendance of the members in Parliament, or to the freedom of debate, was the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of parliamentary privilege; and we may obſerve, in all the addreſſes of new-appointed ſpeakers to the Sovereign, the utmoſt privilege they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is liberty of ſpeech and freedom from arreſts. The very word <hi>privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege</hi> means no more than immunity, or a ſafeguard to the party who poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it, and can never be conſtrued into an active power of invading the rights or eithers.</note>, in reſpect to the purpoſes for which it has hitherto been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſced under, is merely nominal) ſhould be contracted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome certain limits? or whether the ſubject ſhall be left at the mercy of a power, arbitrary upon the face of it, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly under the direction of the crown?</p>
               <p>I do not mean to decline the queſtion of <hi>right:</hi> on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, Sir, I join iſſue with the advocates for privilege; and affirm, that, <q>excepting the caſes wherein the Houſe of
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:023477_0192_0FBFB6B6312884B8"/>
                     <g ref="char:startq">“</g>Commons are a court of judicature, (to which, from the nature of their office, a coercive power muſt belong), and excepting ſuch contempts as immediately interrupt their proceedings, they have no legal authority to impriſon any <g ref="char:endq">”</g>man for any ſuppoſed violation of privilege whatſoever.</q>— It is not pretended, that privilege, as now claimed, has ever been defined or confirmed by ſtatute; neither can it be ſaid, with any colour of truth, to be a part of the common law of England, which had grown into preſcription long before we knew any thing of the exiſtence of a Houſe of Commons. As for the law of Parliament, it is only another name for the privilege in queſtion; and ſince the power of creating new privileges has been formerly renounced by both houſes,— ſince there is no code in which we can ſtudy the law of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, we have but one way left to make ourſelves acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it,—that is, to compare the nature of the inſtitution of a Houſe of Commons with the facts upon record. To eſtabliſh a claim of privilege in either houſe, and to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh original right from uſurpation, it muſt appear, that it is indiſpenſably neceſſary for the performance of the duty they are employed in, and alſo that it has been uniformly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. From the firſt part of this deſcription, it follows clearly, that whatever privilege does of right belong to the preſent Houſe of Commons, did equally belong to the firſt aſſembly of their predeceſſors; was as completely veſted in them, and might have been exerciſed in the ſame extent. From the ſecond, we muſt infer, that privileges, which for ſeveral centuries were not only never allowed, but never even claimed by the Houſe of Commons, muſt be founded upon uſurpation. The conſtitutional duties of a Houſe of Commons are not very complicated nor myſterious. They are to propoſe or aſſent to wholeſome laws for the benefit of the nation. They are to grant the neceſſary aids to the King; petition for the redreſs of grievances; and proſecute treaſon or high crimes againſt the ſtate. If unlimited privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege be neceſſary to the performance of theſe duties, we have reaſon to conclude, that, for many centuries after the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Houſe of Commons, they were never perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I am not bound to prove a negative; but I appeal to the Engliſh hiſtory, when I affirm, that, with the exceptions already ſtated, (which yet I might ſafely relinquiſh), there is to precedent from the year 1205 to the death of Queen Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:023477_0193_0FBFB6B7A6174438"/>of the Houſe of Commons having impriſoned any man (not a member of their houſe) for contempt or head of privilege. In the moſt flagrant caſes, and when their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged privileges were moſt groſsly violated, the <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> Commons,</hi> as they then ſtyled themſelves, never took the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of puniſhment into their own hands. They either ſought redreſs by petition to the King, or, what is more remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, applied for juſtice to the Houſe of Lords; and when ſatisfaction was denied them or delayed, their only remedy was to refuſe proceeding upon, the King's buſineſs. So little conception had our anceſtors of the monſtrous doctrines now maintained concerning privilege, that, in the reign of Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth, even liberty of ſpeech, the vital principle of a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate aſſembly, was reſtrained by the Queen's authority to a ſimple <hi>aye</hi> or <hi>

               <p>I know there are many precedents of arbitrary commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for contempt: but, beſides that they are of too mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern a date to warrant a preſumption that ſuch a power was originally veſted in the Houſe of Commons.—<hi>Fact</hi> alone does not conſtitute <hi>Right.</hi>—If it does, general warrants were lawful.—An ordinance of the two houſes has a force equal to law; and the criminal juriſdiction aſſumed by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in 1621, in the caſe of Edward Lloyd, is a good pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to warrant the like proceedings againſt any man, who ſhall undaviſedly mention the folly of a King, or the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Princeſs—The truth is, Sir, that the greateſt and moſt exceptionable part of the privileges now contended for, were introduced and aſſerted by a Houſe of Commons which aboliſhed both monarchy and peerage, and whoſe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, although they ended in one glorious act of ſubſtantial juſtice, could no way be reconciled to the forms of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Their ſucceſſors profited by the example, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed their power by a moderate or a proper uſe of it. Thus it grew by degrees, from a notorious innovation at one pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, to be tacitly admitted as the privilege of Parliament at another.</p>
               <p>If, however, it could be proved, from conſiderations of neceſſity or convenience, that an unlimited power of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitment
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:023477_0194_0FBFB6B91D613D80"/>ought to be intruſted to the Houſe of Commons, and that <hi>in fact</hi> they have exerciſed it without oppoſition, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

It is leading maxim of the laws of England, (and without it all laws are nugatory), that there is no right without remedy, nor any legal power without a legal courſe to carry it into effect. Let the power now in queſtion be mind by this rule. The ſpeaker iſſues his warrant of attachment. The party attached either reſiſts force with force, or appeals to a magiſtrate, who declares the warrant il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal, and diſcharges the priſoner. Does the law pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride no legal means for enforcing a legal warrant? Is there to regular proceeding pointed out in our law-books to affect and vindicate the authority of ſo high a court as the Houſe of Commons? The queſtion is anſwered directly by the fact.

               <p>I do not mean to purſue them through the remainder of their proceedings. In their firſt reſolutions, it is poſſible they might have been deceived by ill-conſidered precedents. For the reſt, there is no colour of palliation or excuſe. They have adviſed the King to aſſume a power of diſpenſing with the laws by royal proclamation<note n="†" place="bottom">That their practice might be every way conformable to their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the houſe proceeded to adviſe the Crown to publiſh a proclamation, univerſaily acknowledge to be illegal.

It is remarkable enough, that the very men who adviſed the proclamation, an who hear it arraigned every day both within doors and without, are not daring enough to utter one word in us defence nor have they ventured to take the leaſt notice of Mr. Wilkes for diſcharging the perſons apprehended under it.</note>; and Kings, we ſee, are ready enough to follow ſuch advice.—By mere violence, and without the ſhadow of right, they have expunged the record of a judicial proceeding<note n="‡" place="bottom">Lord Chatham very properly called this the act of a mob, not of a ſenate.</note>.

               <p>THEY who object to detached parts of Junius's laſt letter, either do not mean him fairly, or have not conſidered the general ſcope and courſe of his argument.—There are
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:023477_0197_0FBFB6C82571F3E8"/>degrees in all the private vices:—Why not in public proſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution? The influence of the crown naturally makes a ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tennial Parliament dependent.—Does it follow that every Houſe of Commons will plunge at once into the <hi>loweſt depths</hi> of proſtitution?—Junius ſuppoſes, that the preſent Houſe of Commons, in going ſuch enormous lengths, have been <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent to themſelves,</hi> as well as wicked to the public;—that their example is <hi>not within the reach of emulation;</hi>—and that, in the firſ ſeſſion after the next election, <hi>ſome</hi> popular mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures may probably be adopted. He does not expect that a diſſolution of Parliament will deſtroy corruption, but that at leaſt it will be a check and terror to their ſucceſſors, who will have ſeen, that, <hi>in flagrant caſes,</hi> their conſtituents <hi>can</hi> and <hi>will</hi> interpoſe with effect.—After all, Sir, will you not endeavour to remove or alleviate the moſt dangerous ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, becauſe you cannot eradicate the diſeaſe? Will you not puniſh <hi>treaſon</hi> or <hi>parrieide,</hi> becauſe the ſight of a gibbet does not prevent highway robberies? When the main argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Junius is admitted to be unanſwerable, I think it would become the minor critic, who hunts for blemiſhes, to be a little more diſtruſtful of his own ſagacity.—The other objection is hardly worth an anſwer. When Junius obſerves, that Kings are ready enough to follow <hi>ſuch</hi> advice, he does not mean to inſinuate, that if the advice of Parliament were good, the King would be ſo ready to follow it.</p>

               <p>VERY early in the debate upon the deciſion of the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex election, it was well obſerved by <hi>Junius,</hi> that the Houſe of Commons had not only exceeded their boaſted precedent of the expuiſion and ſubſequent incapacitation of Mr. Walpole, but that they had not even adhered to it ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as far as it went.

I believe, Sir, no man, who knows any thing of dialectics, or who underſtands Engliſh, will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the truth and fairneſs of this conſtruction. But <hi>Junius</hi> has a great authority to ſupport him; which, to ſpeak with the Duke of Grafton, I accidentally met with this morning in the courſe of my reading. It contain an admonition, which cannot be repeated too often. Lord Sommers, in his excellent Tract upon the Rights of the People, after reciting the rotes of the convention of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>If <hi>Junius</hi>'s conſtrue on of the vote againſt Mr. Walpole be now admitted, (and indeed I cannot comprehend how it can honeſtly be diſputed, the advocates of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons muſt either give up their precedent entirely, or be reduced to the neceſſity of maintaining one of the groſſeſt abſurdities imaginable, viz. <q>That a commitment to the Tower is a

               </p>
               <p>I need not make you any excuſe for endeavouring to keep alive the attention of the public to the deciſion of the Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſex election. The more I conſider it, the more I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that, as a <hi>fact,</hi> it is indeed highly injurious to the rights of the people; but that, as a <hi>precedent,</hi> it is one of the moſt dangerous that ever was eſtabliſhed againſt theſe who are to come after us. Yet I am ſo far a moderate man, that I verily believe the majority of the Houſe of Commons, when they paſſed this dangerous vote, neither underſtood the queſtion, not knew the conſequence of what they were doing. Their motives were rather deſpicable, than criminal in the extreme. One effect they certainly did not foreſee. They are now reduced to ſuch a ſituation, that if a member of the preſent Houſe of Commons were to conduct himſelf ever ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, and in reality deſerve to be ſent back to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutents with a mark of diſgrace, they would not dare to expel him; becauſe they know that the people, in order to try again the great queſtion of right, or to thwart an odious Houſe of Commons, would probably overlook his immediate unworthineſs, and return the ſame perſon to Parliament. But, in time, the precedent will gain ſtrength. A future Houſe of Commons will have no ſuch apprehendſions, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently will not ſcruple to follow a precedent which they did not eſtabliſh. The miſer himſelf ſeldom lives to enjoy the fruit of his extortion; but his heir ſucceeds to him of courſe, and takes poſſeſſion without cenſure. No man expects him to make reſtitution; and, no matter for his title, he lives quietly upon the eſtate.</p>

               <p>I Confeſs my partiality to <hi>Junius,</hi> and feel a conſiderable pleaſure in being able to communicate any thing to the public in ſupport of his opinions. The doctrine land down
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:023477_0200_0FBFB03FA9955ED8"/>in his laſt letter, concerning the power of the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to commit for contempt, is not ſo new as it appeared to many people; who, dazzled with the name of <hi>privilege,</hi> had never ſuffered themſelves to examine the queſtion fairly. <hi>In the courſe of my reading this morning,</hi> I met with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing paſſage in the Journals of the Houſe of Commons, (Vol. I. page 603.) Upon occaſion of a juriſdiction unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſſumed by the Houſe in the year 1621 <abbr>l</abbr> Mr. Attorney General <hi>Neye</hi> gave his opinion as follows: <q>No doubt but, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>in ſome caſes, this Houſe may give judgment;—in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of returns, and concerning members of our houſe, or falling out in our view in Parliament: but, for foreign matters, knoweth not how he can judge it.—Knoweth not that we have been uſed to give judgment in any caſe, but <g ref="char:endq">”</g>thoſe before mentioned.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Sir Edward Coke, upon the ſame ſubject, ſays, (page 604.) <q>
                     <g ref="char:startq">“</g>No queſtion but this is a houſe of record, and that it hath power of judicature in ſome caſes;—have power to judge of returns and members of our houſe: one, no member, offending out of the Parliament, <hi>when he came hither and <g ref="char:endq">”</g>juſtified it,</hi> was cenſured for it.</q>

               <p>Now, Sir, if you will compare the opinion of theſe great ſages of the law with <hi>Junius</hi>'s doctrine, you will find they tally exactly.—He allows the power of the houſe to commit their own members; (which however they may groſsly abuſe:) He allows their power in caſes where they are acting as a court of judicature, viz. elections, returns, &amp;c.:—And he allows it in ſuch contempts as immediately interrupt their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; or, as Mr. Noye expreſſes it, <hi>falling out in their view in Parliament.</hi>

               <p>Welbore Ellis, what ſay you? Is this the law of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or is it not? I am a plain man, Sir, and cannot fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low you through the phlegmatic forms of an oration. Speak out, Grildrig; ſay yes, or no.—If you ſay <hi>yes,</hi> I ſhall then inquire by what authority Mr. De Grey, the honeſt Lord Mansfield, and the Barons of the Exchequer, dared to grant a writ of <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> for bringing the bodies of the Lord Mayor and Mr. Oliver before them; and why the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Tower made any return to a writ, which the Houſe of Commons had, in a ſimilar inſtance, declared to be unlawful.—If you ſay <hi>us,</hi> take care you do not at once give up the cauſe in ſupport of which you have ſo long and ſo laboriouſly tortured your underſtanding. Take care you do not confeſs that there is no teſt by which we can diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, —no evidence by which we can determine, what is, and what is not, the law of Parliament. The reſolutions I have quoted ſtand upon your journals, uncontroverted, and unrepealed:—they contain a declaration of the law of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament by a court competent to the queſtion, and whoſe deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as you and Lord Mansfield ſay, muſt be law, becauſe there is no appeal from it; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

<pb n="200" facs="unknown:023477_0203_0FBFB04661F6EA70"/>of which you now deny? If you ſay that Parliaments are not infallible; and that Queen Anne, in conſequence of the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent proceedings of that Houſe of Commons, was obliged to prorogue and diſſolve them; I ſhall agree with you very heartily, and think that the precedent ought to be followed immediately. But you, Mr. Ellis, who hold this language, are inconſiſtent with your own principles. You have hitherto maintained, that the Houſe of Commons are the ſole judges of their own privileges, and that their declaration does <hi>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

When the King was urged to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the preſent Parliament, you adviſed him to tell his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that <hi>he was careful not to aſſume any of thoſe powers which the conſtitution bed placed in other bands,</hi> &amp;c. Yet Queen Anne, it ſeems, was juſtified in exerting her prerogative to ſtop a Houſe of Commons, whoſe proceedings, compared with thoſe of the aſſembly of which you are a moſt worthy mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, were the perfection of juſtice and reaſon.</p>
               <p>In what a labyrinth of nonſenſe does a man involve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who labours to maintain falſehood by argument? How much better would it become the dignity of the Houſe of Commons to ſpeak plainly to the people, and tell us at once, <hi>that their will muſt be obeyed, not becauſe it is lawful and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, but becauſe it is their will?</hi> Their conſtituents would have a better opinion of their candour, and, I promiſe you, not a worſe opinion of their integrity.</p>

                  <salute>MY LORD,</salute>

               <p>THE profound reſpect I bear to the gracious Prince who governs this country with no leſs honour to himſelf than ſatisfaction to his ſubjects, and who reſtores you to your rank under his ſtandard, will ſave you from a multitude of reproaches. The attention I ſhould have paid to your fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:023477_0204_0FBFB04822A54B10"/>is involuntarily attracted to the hand that rewards them, and though I am not ſo partial to the royal judgment, as to affirm, that the favour of a King can remove mountains of infamy, it ſerves to leſſen at leaſt, for undoubtedly it divides the burden. While I remember how much is due to <hi>his</hi> ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred character, I cannot, with any decent appearance of propriety, call you the meaneſt and the baſeſt fellow in the kingdom. I proteſt, my Lord, I do not think you ſo. You will have a dangerous rival in that kind of fame to which you have hitherto ſo happily directed your ambition, as long <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>ce, and ſit to be truſted with any ſhare in his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I confeſs you have great intrinſic merit; but take one you do not value it too highly. Conſider how much of it would have been loſt to the world, if the King had not gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly aſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ed his ſtamp, and given it currency among his ſubjects. If it be true that a virtuous man, ſtruggling with adverſity, be a ſcene worthy of the gods, the glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention between you and the beſt of Princes deſerves a circle equally attentive and reſpectable: I think I already ſee other gods riſing from the earth to behold it.</p>
               <p>But this language is too mild for the occaſion. The King is determined that your abilities ſhall not be loſt to ſociety. The perpetration and deſcription of new crimes will find employment for as both. My Lord, if the perſons who have been loudeſt in their profeſſions of patriotiſm, had done their duty to the public with the ſame zeal and perſeverance that I did, I will not aſſert that government would have recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its dignity, but at leaſt our gracious Sovereign muſt have ſpared his ſubjects this laſt inſult<note n="*" place="bottom">The Duke was lately appointed lord Privy Seal.</note>; which, if there be any feeling left among us, they will reſent more than even the real injuries they received from every meaſure of your Grace's adminiſtration. In vain would he have looked round him for another character ſo conſummate as yours. Lord Mansfield ſhrinks from him principles:—his ideas of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment perhaps go farther than your own, but his heart diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graces the theory of his underſtanding.—Charles Fox is yet in bloſſom; and as for Mr. Wedderburne, there is ſomething about him which even treachery cannot truſt. For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, therefore, the beſt of Princes muſt have contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with Lord Sandwich.—You would long ſince have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:023477_0205_0FBFB04EECADA328"/>your final diſmiſſion and reward; and I, my Lord, who do not eſteem you the more for the high office you poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, would willingly have followed you to your retirement. There is ſurely ſomething ſingularly benevolent in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of our Sovereign. From the moment he aſcended the throne, there is no crime, of which human nature is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, (and I call upon the recorder to witneſs it). that has not appeared venial in his ſight. With any other Prince, the ſhameful deſertion of him in the midſt of that diſtreſs which you alone had created,—in the very criſis of danger, when be fancied he ſaw the throne already ſurrounded by men of virtue and abilities, would have outweighed the memory of your former ſervices. But his Majeſty is full of juſtice and underſtands the doctrine of compenſations. He remembers with gratitude how ſoon you had accommodated your mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals to the neceſſity of his ſervice;—how cheerfully you had abandoned the engagements of private friendſhip, and renounced the moſt ſolemn profeſſions to the public. The ſacrifice of Lord Chatham was not loſt upon him. Even the cowardice and perfidy of deſerting him, may have done you no diſſervice in his eſteem. The inſtance was painful, but the principle might pleaſe.</p>
               <p>You did not neglect the magiſtrate, while you flattered the <hi>man.</hi> The expulſion of Mr. Wilkes, predetermined in the cabinet;—the power of depriving the ſubject of his birth-right, attributed to a reſolution of one branch of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;—the conſtitution impudently invaded by the Houſe of Commons;—the right of defending it, treacherouſly renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the Houſe of Lords:—theſe are the ſtrokes, my Lord, which, in the preſent reign, recommend to office, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute a miniſter. They would have determined your Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign's judgment, if they had made no impreſſion upon his heart. We need not look for any other ſpecies of merit to account for his taking the earlieſt opportunity to recal you to his councils. Yet you have other merit in abundance.—Mr. Hine,—the Duke of Portland,—and Mr. Yorke:—Breach of truſt, robbery, and murder. You would think it a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to your gallantry, if I added rape to the catalogue;— but the ſtyle of your amours ſecures you from reſiſtance. I know how well theſe ſeveral charges have been defended. In the firſt inſtance, the breach of truſt is ſuppoſed to have been its own reward. Mr. Bradſhaw affirms upon his honour,
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:023477_0206_0FBFB05180B57908"/>(and ſo may the gift of ſmiling never depart from him!) that you reſerved no part of Mr. Hine's purchaſe-money for your own uſe, but that every ſhilling of it was ſcrupulouſly paid to Governor Burgoyne.—Make haſte, my Lord;—another patent, applied in time, may keep the OAKS<note n="*" place="bottom">A ſuperb villa of Col. Burgoyne, about this time advertiſed for ſale.</note> in the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. —If not, Burham-Wood, I fear, muſt come to the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </p>
               <p>The Duke of Portland was in life your earlieſt friend. In defence of his property he had nothing to plead but equity againſt Sir James Lowther, and preſcription againſt the crown. You felt for your friend; <hi>but th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It looks like the hurry and confuſion of a young highwayman, who takes a few ſhillings, but leaves the purſe and watch behind him: —And yet the Duke was an old offender!</note>.</p>
               <p>Enough has been ſaid of that deteſtable tranſaction which ended in the death of Mr. Yorke;—I cannot ſpeak of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out horror and compaſſion. To excuſe yourſelf, you pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly impeach your accomplice; and to <hi>his</hi> mind perhaps the accuſation may be flattery. But in murder you are both prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipals. It was once a queſtion of emulation; and, if the event had not diſappointed the immediate ſchemes of the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, it might ſtill have been a hopeful ſubject of jeſt and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment between you.</p>
               <p>This letter, my Lord, is only a preface to my future cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence. The remainder of the ſummer ſhall be dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to your amuſement. I mean now and then to relieve the ſeverity of your morning ſtudies, and to prepare you for the buſineſs of the day. Without pretending to more than Mr. Bradſhaw's ſincerity, you may rely upon my attachment as long as you are in office.</p>
               <p>Will your Grace forgive me, if I venture to expreſs ſome anxiety for a man whom I know you do not love? My Lord Weymouth has cowardice to plead, and a deſertion of lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er date than your own. You know the privy-ſeal was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for him: and, if you conſider the dignity of the poſt he deſerted, you will hardly think it decent to quarter him on Mr. Righy. Yet he muſt have bread, my Lord;—or
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:023477_0207_0FBFB05526C53F48"/>rather he muſt have wine. If you deny him the cup, there will be no keeping him within the pale of the miniſtry.</p>

                     </gap>
                  </hi> with particular attention. I have endeavoured therefore, and not without ſucceſs, (as
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:023477_0208_0FBFB058C3FF77D0"/>perhaps you may remember,) to furniſh it with ſuch inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting and edifying intelligence, as probably would not reach him through any other channel. The ſervices you have done the nation,—your integrity in office, and ſignal fidelity to your approved good Maſter, have been faithfully recorded. Nor have his own virtues been entirely neglected. Theſe letters, my Lord, are read in other countries and in other languages; and I think I may affirm without vanity, that the gracious character of the beſt of Princes, is by this time not only perfectly known to his ſubjects, but tolerably well underſtood by the reſt of Europe, In this reſpect alone I have the advantage of Mr. Whitehead. His plan I think, is too narrow. He ſeems to manufacture his verſes for the ſole uſe of the hero who is ſuppoſed to be the ſubject of them: and, that his meaning may not be exported in foreign bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, ſets all tranſlation at defiance.</p>
               <p>Your Grace's re-appointment to a ſeat in the cabinet, was announced to the public by the ominous return of Lord Bate to this country. When that noxious planet approaches Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, he never fails to bring plague and peſtilence along with him. The King already feels the malignant effect of your influence over his councils. Your former adminiſtration made Mr. Wilkes an alderman of London, and repreſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of Middleſex. Your next appearance in office is marked with his election to the ſhrievalty. In whatever meaſure you are concerned, you are not only diſappointed of ſucceſs, but always contrive to make the government of the beſt of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces contemptible in his own eyes, and ridiculous to the whole world. Making all due allowance for the effect of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter's declared interpoſition, Mr. Robinſon's activity, and Mr. Horne's new zeal in ſupport of adminiſtration, we ſtill want the genius of the Duke of Grafton to account for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the whole intereſt of government in the city to the conduct of Mr. Harley. I will not bear hard upon your faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful friend and emiſſary Mr. Touchit; for I know the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his ſituation and that a few lottery tickets are of uſe to his oeconomy. There is a proverb concerning perſons in the predicament of this gentleman, which, however, cannot be ſtrictly applied to him: <hi>They commence dupes, and finiſh knaves.</hi> Now Mr. Touchit's character is uniform. I am convinced that his ſentiments never depended upon his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and that in the moſt proſperous ſtate of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:023477_0209_0FBFB059F5705FC8"/>he was always the very man be is at preſent.—But was there no other perſon of rank and conſequence in the city, whom government could confide in, but a notorious Jaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite? Did you imagine that the whole body of the Diſſenters, that the whole Whig intereſt of London, would attend at the levee, and ſubmit to the directions, of a notorious Jacobite? Was there no Whig magiſtrate in the city, to whom the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of George the Third could intruſt the management of a buſineſs ſo very intereſting to their Maſter as the election of ſheriffs? Is there no room at St. James's but for Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Jacobites? My Lord, I do not mean to queſtion the ſincerity of Mr. Harley's attachment to his Majeſty's govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Since the commencement of the preſent reign, I have ſeen ſtill greater contradictions reconciled. The principles of theſe worthy Jacobites are not ſo abſurd as they have been repreſented. Their ideas of divine right are not ſo much an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the perſon or family, as to the political character of the Sovereign. Had there ever been an honeſt man among the <hi>Stuarts,</hi> his Majeſty's preſent friends would have been Whigs upon principle. But the converſion of the beſt of Princes have removed their ſcruples. They have forgiven him the ſins of his Hanoverian anceſtors, and acknowledge the hand of Providence in the deſcent of the crown upon the head of a true <hi>Stuart.</hi> In you, my Lord, they alſo behold, with a kind of predilection which borders upon loyalty, the natural repreſentative of that illuſtrious family. The mode of your deſcent from Charles the Second, is only a bar to your pretenſions to the crown, and no way interrupts the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of your ſucceſſion to all the virtues of the <hi>Stuarts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The unfortunate ſucceſs of the Reverend Mr. Horne's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, in ſupport of the miniſterial nomination of $words, will, I fear, obſtruct his preferment. Permit me to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

You will find him copiouſly gifted with thoſe qualities of the heart, which uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally direct you in the choice of the your friendſhips. He too was Mr. Wilkes's friend, and as incapable as you are of the liberal reſentment of a gentleman. No, my Lord—it was the ſolitary vindictive malice of a monk, brooding over the infirmities of his friend until he thought they quickened into public life, and feaſting with a rancorous rapture upon the ſordid catalogue of his diſtreſſes. Now let him go back to
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:023477_0210_0FBFB05E931C0760"/>his cloiſter. The church is a proper retreat for him. In his principles he is already a biſhop.</p>
               <p>The mention of this man has moved me from my natural moderation. Let me return to your Grace. You are the pillow upon which I am determined to reſt all my reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. What idea can the beſt of Sovereigns form to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his own government?—In what repute can he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that he ſtands with his people, when he ſees, beyond the poſſibility of a doubt, that, whatever he the office, the ſuſpicion of his favour is fatal to the candidate; and that when the party he wiſhes well to has the faireſt proſpect of ſucceſs, if his royal inclination ſhould unfortunately be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, it drops like an acid, and turns the election?</p>
               <p>This event, among others, may perhaps contribute to open his Majeſty's eyes to his real honour and intereſt. In ſpite of all your Grace's ingenuity, he may at laſt perceive the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience of ſelecting, with ſuch a curious felicity, every villain in the nation to fill the various departments of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Yet I ſhould be ſorry to confine him in the choice either of his footmen or his friends.</p>

                  <hi>FARCE, Comedy, and Tragedy—Wilkes, Foore, and Junius</hi> united at the ſame time againſt one poor Parſon, are fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful odds.

               <p>I put the matter fairly to iſſue.—I ſay, that ſo far from any "new zeal in ſupport of adminiſtration," I am poſſeſſed with the utmoſt abhorrence of their meaſures; and that I have ever ſhewn myſelf, and am ſtill ready, in any rational man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to lay down all I have—my life, in oppoſition to thoſe meaſures. I ſay, that I have not, and never have had, any communication or connection of any kind, directly or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, with any courtier or miniſterial man, or any of their adherents: that I never have received, or ſolicited, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, or deſired, or do now hope for, any reward of any ſort, from any party or ſet of men in adminiſtration or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. I ſay that I never uſed any <q>endeavours in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port <g ref="char:startq">“</g>
                     <g ref="char:endq">”</g>of the miniſterial nomination of ſheriffs;</q> that I did not ſolicit any one livery-man for his vote for any one of the candidates, nor employ any other perſon to ſolicit; and that I did not write one ſingle line or word in favour of Meſſrs. Plumbe and Kirkman, whom I underſtand to have been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the miniſtry.</p>
               <p>You are bound to refute what I here advance, or to loſe your credit for veracity. You muſt produce facts: ſurmiſe and general abuſe, in however elegant language, ought not to paſs for proofs. You have every advantage; and I have every diſadvantage: you are unknown: I give my name. All parties, both in and out of adminiſtration, have their reaſons (which I ſhall relate hereafter) for uniting in their wiſhes againſt me; and the popular prejudice is as ſtrongly in your favour, as it is violent againſt the Parſon.</p>
               <p>Singular as my preſent ſituation is, it is neither painful, nor was it unforeſeen. He is not fit for public buſineſs, who does not even at his entrance prepare his mind for ſuch an event.

But as a public man I muſt for ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn you. You cannot but know,—nay you dare not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to be ignorant, that the higheſt gratification of which the moſt deteſtable<note n="***" place="bottom">This letter was tranſmitted privately by the Printer to Mr. Horne, by Junius's requeſt. Mr. Horne retained it to the Printer, with direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to publiſh it.</note> in this nation is capable, would have been the defeat of Wilkes. I know <hi>that man</hi> much better than any of you. Nature intended him only for a good-hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured fool. A ſyſtematical education, with long practice, has made him a conſummate hypocrite. Yet this man, to ſay nothing of his worthy miniſters, you have moſt aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly laboured to gratify. To exclude Wilkes, it was not neceſſary you ſhould ſolicit votes for his opponents. We in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the balance as effectually by leſſening the weight in one ſcale, as by increaſing it in the other.</p>
               <p>The mode of your attack upon Wilkes, (though I am far from thinking meanly of your abilities) convinces me, that you either want judgment extremely, or that you are blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by your reſentment.

You will not ſuſpect me as ſetting up Wilkes for a perfect character. The queſtion to the public is, Where ſhall we find a man, who, with purer principles, will go the lengths and run the hazards that he has done? The ſeaſon calls for ſuch a man, and he ought to be ſupported. What would have been the triumph of that odious hypocrite and his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, if <hi>Wilkes</hi> had been not enjoy it completely.—But now, I promiſe you, you have ſo little power to do miſchief, that I much queſtion whether the miniſtry will adhere to the promiſes they have made you. It will be in vain to ſay
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:023477_0214_0FBFB06FBA121AA8"/>that I am a partizan of Mr. Wilkes, or perſonally your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. You will convince no man, for you do not believe it yourſelf. Yet I confeſs I am a little offended at the low rate at which you ſeem to value my underſtanding. I beg, Mr. Horne, you will hereafter believe, that I meaſure the integrity of men by their conduct, not by their profeſſions. Such takes may entertain Mr. Oliver, or your grandmother; but, truſt me, they are thrown away upon <hi>Junius.</hi>

               </opener>
               <p>YOU have diſappointed me. When I told you that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and general abuſe, in however elegant language, ought not to paſs for proofs, I evidently hinted at the reply which I expected: but you have dropped your uſual ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, and ſeem willing to try what will be the effect of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe and general abuſe in very coarſe language. Your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to my letter (which I hope was cool, and temperate, and modeſt) has convinced me, that my idea of a <hi>man</hi> is much ſuperior to yours of a <hi>gentleman.</hi> Of your former let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:023477_0215_0FBFB07130E03500"/>I have always ſaid, <hi>Materiem ſuperabat opus.</hi> I do not think ſo of the preſent; the principles are more deteſtable than the expreſſions are mean and illiberal. I am contented, that all thoſe who adopt the one, ſhould for ever load me with the other.</p>
               <p>I appeal to the common ſenſe of the public, to which I have ever directed myſelf: I believe they have it, though I am ſometimes half-inclined to ſuſpect that Mr. Wilkes has formed a truer judgment of mankind than I have. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, of this I am ſure, that there is nothing elſe upon which to place a ſteady reliance. Trick, and low cunning, and addreſſing their prejudices and paſſions, may be the fitteſt means to carry a particular point; but if they have not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-ſenſe, there is no proſpect of gaining for them any real permanent good. The ſame paſſions which have been art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſed by an honeſt man for their advantage, may be more artfully employed by a diſhoneſt man for their deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I deſire them to apply their common-ſenſe to this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Junius;</hi> not for my ſake, but their own: it concerns them moſt nearly; for the principles it contains lead to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and ruin, and are inconſiſtent with every notion of civil ſociety.</p>
               <p>The charges which <hi>Junius</hi> has brought againſt me, are made ridiculous by his own inconſiſtency and ſelf-contradiction. He charges me poſitively with <q>a new zeal in ſupport of <g ref="char:startq">“</g>
                     <g ref="char:endq">”</g>adminiſtration;</q> and with <q>endeavours in ſupport of the <g ref="char:startq">“</g>
                     <g ref="char:endq">”</g>miniſterial nomination of ſheriffs.</q> And he aſſigns two inconſiſtent motives for my conduct: either that I have <q>

                     <g ref="char:startq">“</g>

                     <g ref="char:endq">”</g>vindictive <hi>malice</hi> of a monk;</q> either that I am influenced by a ſordid deſire of <hi>gain,</hi> or am hurried on by <q>perſonal <hi>hatred,</hi>

                  </q> In his letter to the Duke of Grafton, he ſuppoſes me actuated by both: in his letter to me, he at firſt doubts which of the two, whether intereſt, or revenge, is my motive. However, at laſt he determines for the former, and again poſitively aſſerts that <q>the miniſtry <g ref="char:startq">“</g>
                     <g ref="char:endq">”</g>have made me promiſes:</q> yet he produces no inſtance of corruption, nor pretends to have any intelligence of a miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial connection. He mentions no <hi>cauſe</hi> of a perſonal hatred to Mr. Wilkes, nor any <hi>reaſon</hi> for my reſentment or revenge; nor has Mr. Wilkes himſelf ever hinted any, though repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly preſſed.

               <p>Let <hi>Junius</hi> now, if he pleaſes, change his abuſe; and, quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his looſe hold of <hi>intereſt</hi> and <hi>revenge,</hi> accuſe me of <hi>vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and call this defence <hi>blaſting.</hi> I own I have a pride to ſee ſtatutes decreed, and the higheſt honours conferred, for meaſures and actions which all men have approved; whilſt thoſe who counſelled and cauſed them are execrated and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted.

                     </gap>ays</hi> thoſe he would have promoted,) diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed from me whoſe partizan he is. When Lord Chatham can forgive the awkward ſituation in which, for the ſake of the public, he was deſignedly placed by the thanks to him from the city; and when <hi>Wilkes</hi>'s <hi>name</hi> ceaſes to be neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Lord Rockingham to keep up a clamour againſt the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> of the miniſtry, without obliging the different factions now in oppoſition to bind themſelves before-hand to ſome certain points, and to ſtipulate ſome preciſe advantages to the public; then, and not till then, may thoſe whom he now abuſes expect the approbation of <hi>Junius.</hi> The approbation of the public for our faithful attention to their intereſt, by endeavours for thoſe ſtipulations, which have made us as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to the factions in oppoſition as to thoſe in adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is not perhaps to be expected till ſome years hence; when the public will look back, and ſee how ſhamefully they have been deluded, and by what arts they were made to loſe the golden opportunity of preventing what they will ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly experience,—a change of miniſters, without a material change of meaſures, and without any ſecurity for a tottering conſtitution.</p>
               <p>But what cares <hi>Junius</hi> for the ſecurity of the conſtitution? He has now unfolded to us his diabolical principles. <hi>As a public man, he muſt ever condemn</hi> any meaſure which may tend accidentally to <hi>gratify</hi> the Sovereign; and Mr. Wilkes is to be ſupported and aſſiſted in all his attempts (no matter how ridiculous and miſchievous his projects) <hi>as long as he continues to be a thorn in the King's ſide!</hi>—The <hi>cauſe of the country,</hi> it ſeems, in the opinioin of <hi>Junius,</hi> is merely to vex the King;
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:023477_0220_0FBFB084B9C72EF8"/>and any raſcal is to be ſupported in any roguery, provided he can only thereby plant <hi>a thorn in the King's ſide.</hi>—This is the very extremity of faction, and the laſt degree of political wickedneſs. Becauſe Lord Chatham has been ill treated by the King, and treacherouſly betrayed by the Duke of Graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, the latter is to be <q>the pillow on which <hi>Junius</hi> will reſt <g ref="char:startq">“</g>
                     <g ref="char:endq">”</g>his reſentment:</q> and the public are to oppoſe the meaſures of government from mere motives of perſonal enmity to the Sovereign! Theſe are the avowed principles of the man who, in the ſame letter, ſay, <q>if ever he ſhould be convinced <g ref="char:startq">“</g>that I had no motive but to deſtroy Wilkes, he ſhall then be reader to do juſtice to my character, and to declare to the world, that he deſpiſes me ſomewhat leſs than he does <g ref="char:endq">”</g>at preſent!</q> Had I ever acted from perſonal affection or enmity to Mr. Wilkes, I ſhould juſtly be deſpiſed: but what does he deſerve, whoſe avowed motive is perſonal enmity to the Sovereign? The contempt which I ſhould otherwiſe feel for the abſurdity and glaring inconſiſtency of <hi>Junius,</hi> is here ſwallowed up in my abhorrence of his principles. The <hi>right divine</hi> and <hi>ſacredneſs</hi> of Kings is to me a ſenſeleſs jargon. It was thought a daring expreſſion of Oliver Cromwell in the time of Charles the Firſt, that if he found himſelf placed op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to the King in battle, he would diſcharge his piece into his boſom as ſoon as into any other man's. I go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: had I lived in thoſe days, I would not have waited for chance to give me an opportunity of doing my duty; I would have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ought him through the ranks, and, without the leaſt perſonal enmity, have diſcharged my piece into his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom <hi>rather</hi> than into any other man's. The King whoſe actions juſtify rebellion to his government, deſerves death from the hand of every ſubject. And ſhould ſuch a time ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, I ſhall be as free to act as to ſay: but, till then, my attachment to the perſon and family of the Sovereign ſhall ever be found more zealous and ſincere than that of his flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers. I would offend the Sovereign with as much reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as the parent; but if the happineſs and ſecurity of the whole family made it neceſſary, ſo far, and no farther, I would offend him without remorſe.</p>
               <p>But let us conſider a little whither theſe principles of <hi>Junius</hi> would lead us. Should Mr. Wilkes once more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion Mr. Thomas Walpole to procure for him a penſion of <hi>one thouſand pounds</hi> upon the Iriſh eſtabliſhment for thirty

               <p>Should he demand the government of <hi>Canada,</hi> or of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica,</hi> or the embaſſy of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and in caſe of refuſal threaten to write them down, as he had before ſerved ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adminiſtration, in a year and a half, he muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in his pretenſions, and upheld in his inſolence—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would mortify the King!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Junius</hi> may chooſe to ſuppoſe that theſe things cannot hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen! But that they have happened, notwithſtanding Mr. Wilkes's denial, I do aver.

At that time he drew up the heads of an engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which he gave to me, with a requeſt that I would couch it in terms ſo cautions and preciſe, as to leave no room for future quibble and evaſion; but to oblige them either to ful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>It was the ſame motive which dictated the thanks of the city to Lord Chatham; which were expreſſed to be given for his declaration in favour of <hi>ſhort Parliaments;</hi> in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to fix Lord Chatham at leaſt to that one conſtitutional re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, without which all others can afford no ſecurity.

               <p>I OUGHT to make an apology to the Duke of Grafton, for ſuffering any part of my attention to be diverted from his Grace to Mr. Horne. I am not juſtified by the ſunila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their diſpoſitions. Private vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>nſure of the preſs, unleſs they are united with the power of doing ſome ſignal miſchief to the community. Mr. Horne's ſituation does not correſpond with his intentions.—In my own opinion, (which, I know, will be attributed to any uſual vanity and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) his letter to me does not deſerve an anſwer. But I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that the public are not ſatisfied with my ſilence;—
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:023477_0225_0FBFB095E9A46680"/>that an anſwer is expected from me; and that if I perfiſt in refuſing to plead, it will be taken for conviction. I ſhould be inconſiſtent with the principles I profeſs, if I declined an appeal to the good ſenſe of the people, or did not willingly ſubmit myſelf to the judgment of my peers.</p>
               <p>If any coarſe expreſſions have eſcaped me, I am ready to agree that they are unfit for Junius to make uſe of; but I ſee no reaſon to admit that they have been improperly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied.</p>
               <p>Mr. Horne, it ſeems, is unable to comprehend how an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme want of conduct and diſcretion can conſiſt with the abilities I have allowed him; nor can he conceive that a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry honeſt man, with a very good underſtanding, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by a knave. His knowledge of human nature muſt be limited indeed. Had he never mixed with the world, one would think that even his books might have taught him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Did he hear Lord Mansfield when he defended his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine concerning libels?—or when he ſtated the law in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions for criminal converſation?—or when he delivered his reaſons for calling the Houſe of Lords together to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a copy of his charge to the jury in Woodfall's trial?— Had he been preſent upon any of theſe occaſions, he would have ſeen how poſſible it is for a man of the firſt talents to confound himſelf in abſurdities, which would diſgrace the lips of an idiot. Perhaps the example might have taught him not to value his own underſtanding ſo highly.—Lord Lyttleton's integrity and judgment are unqueſtionable;—yet he is known to admire that cunning Scotchman, and verily believes him an honeſt man.—I ſpeak to facts with which all of us are converſant.—I ſpeak to men, and to their experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and will not deſcend to anſwer the little ſneering ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtries of a collegian.—Diſtinguiſhed talents are not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily connected with diſcretion. If there be any thing remarkable in the character of Mr. Horne, it is, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme want of judgment ſhould be united with his very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate capacity. Yet I have not forgotten the acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I made him. He owes it to my bounty; and, though his letter has lowered him in my opinion, I ſcorn to retract the charitable donation.</p>
               <p>I ſaid, it would be <hi>very difficult</hi> for Mr. Horne to write directly in defence of a miniſterial meaſure, and not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected; and even that difficulty I confined to <hi>his</hi> particular
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:023477_0226_0FBFB0977756ABF8"/>ſituation. He changes the terms of the propoſition, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes me to aſſert, that it would be <hi>imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſible</hi> for <hi>any</hi> man to write for the newſpapers, and not be diſcovered.</p>
               <p>He repeatedly affirms, or intimates at leaſt, that he known the author of theſe letters.—With what colour of truth, then, can he pretend <hi>that I am no where to be encountered but in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>ſpaper?</hi>—I ſhall leave him to his ſuſpicions. It is not acceſſary that I ſhould confide in the honour or diſcretion of a man who already ſeems to hate me with as much rancour as if I had formerly been his friend.—But he aſſerts that he has traced me through a variety of ſignatures. To make the diſcovery of any importance to his purpoſe, he ſhould have proved, either that the fictitious character of <hi>Junius</hi> has not been confiſtently ſupported, or that the author has manitained different principles under different ſignatures.—I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call to my memory the numberleſs trifles I have written;— but I rely upon the conſciouſneſs of my own integrity, and defy him to fix any colourable charge of inconſiſtency up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me.</p>
               <p>I am not bound to aſſign the ſecret motives of his appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent hatred of Mr. Wilkes: nor does it follow that I may not judge fairly of <hi>his</hi> conduct, though it were true <hi>that I had no conduct of my own.</hi>—Mr. Horne enlarges with rapture upon the importance of his ſervices; the dreadful battles which he might have been engaged in, and the dangers he has eſcaped.—In ſupport of the formidable deſcription, he quotes verſes without mercy. The gentleman deals in fiction, and naturally appeals to the evidence of the poets.—Taking him at his word, he cannot but admit the ſuperiority of Mr. Wilkes in this line of ſervice. On one ſide we ſee nothing but imaginary diſtreſſes. On the other, we ſee real proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; —real penalties;—real impriſonment;—life repeatedly hazarded; and, at one moment, almoſt the certainty of death. Thanks are undoubtedly due to every man who does his duty in the engagement; but it is the wounded ſoldier who deſerves the reward.</p>
               <p>I did not mean to deny that Mr. Horne had been an active partizan. It would defeat my own purpoſe not to allow him a degree of merit, which aggravates his guilt. The very charge <hi>of contributing his utmoſt efforts to ſupport a miniſterial meaſure,</hi> implies an acknowledgment of his former ſervices. If he had not once been diſtinguiſhed by his apparent zeal in
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:023477_0227_0FBFB098E4B4CE08"/>defence of the common cauſe, he could not now be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by deſerting it.—As for myſelf, it is no longer a queſtion, <hi>whether I ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

Is there no merit in dedicating my life to the information of my fellow-ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects? —What public queſtion have I declined?—What vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain have I ſpared?—Is there no labour in the compoſition of theſe letters? Mr. Horne, I fear, is partial to me, and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures the facility of <hi>my</hi> writings, by the fluency of his own.</p>
               <p>He talks to us in high terms of the gallant feats he would have performed if he had lived in the laſt century. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Charles could hardly have eſcaped him. But living princes have a claim to his attachment and reſpect. Upon theſe terms, there is no danger in being a patriot. If he means any thing more than a pompous rhapsody, let us try how well his argument holds together.—I preſume he is not yet ſo much a courtier as to affirm that the conſtitution has not been groſsly and daringly violated under the preſent reign. He will not ſay that the laws have not been ſhamefully bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or perverted;—that the rights of the ſubject have not been invaded, or that redreſs has not been repeatedly ſolicited and refuſed.—Grievances like theſe were the foundation of the rebellion in the laſt century; and, if I underſtand Mr. Horne, they would, at that period, have juſtified him to his own mind in deliberately attacking the life of his Sovereign. I ſhall not aſk him to what political conſtitution this doctrine can be reconciled. But at leaſt it is incumbent upon him to ſhew, that the preſent King has better excuſes than Charles the Firſt for the errors of his government. He ought to demonſtrate to us, that the conſtitution was better underſtood an hundred years ago than it is at preſent;—that the legal rights of the ſubject, and the limits of the prerogative were more accurately defined and more clearly comprehended. If propoſitions like theſe cannot he fairly maintained, I do not ſee how he can reconcile it to his conſcience, not to act im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately with the ſame freedom with which he ſpeaks. I reverence the character of Charles the Firſt as little as Mr.
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:023477_0228_0FBFB09A62465E48"/>Horne; but I will not inſult his misfortunes by a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that would degrade him.</p>
               <p>It is worth obſerving, by what gentle degrees the furious, perſecuting zeal of Mr. Horne has ſoftened into moderation. Men and meaſures were yeſterday his objects. What pains did he once take to bring that great ſtate-criminal <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution! —To-day he conſines himſelf to meaſures only. No penal example is to be left to the ſucceſſors of the Duke of Grafton.—To-morrow, I preſume, both men and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures will be forgiven. The flaming patriot, who ſo lately <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>I comprehend the policy of endeavoaring to communicate to Mr. Oliver and Mr. Saubridge a ſhare in the reproaches with which he ſuppoſes me to have loaded him. My memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fails me, if I have mentioned their names with diſreſpect; unleſs it be reproachful to acknowledge a fincere reſpect for the character of Mr. Sawbridge, and not to have queſtioned the innocence of Mr. Oliver's intentions.</p>
               <p>It ſeems I am a partizan of the great leader of the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If the charge had been a reproach, it ſhould have been better ſupported. I did not intend to make a public decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the reſpect I hear Lord Chatham. I well knew what unworthy concluſions would be drawn from it. But I am called upon to deliver my opinion; and ſurely it is not in the little cenſure of Mr. Horne to deter me from doing ſignal juſtice to a man who, I confeſs, has grown upon my eſteem. As for the common, ſordid views of avarice, or any purpoſe of vulgar ambition, I queſtion whether the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of <hi>Junius</hi> would be of ſervice to Lord Chatham. <hi>My</hi> vote will hardly recommend him to an increaſe of his penſion, or to a ſeat in the cabinet.

My abhorrence of the Duke ariſes from an intimate knowledge of his character: and from a thorough conviction that his baſeneſs has been the cauſe of greater miſchief to England, than even the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate ambition of Lord Bute.</p>
               <p>The ſhortening the duration of Parliaments is a ſubject on which Mr. Horne cannot enlarge too warmly; nor will I que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion his ſincerity. If I did not profeſs the ſame ſentiments, I ſhould be ſhamefully inconſiſtent with myſelf. It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to bind Lord Chatham by the written formality of an engagement. He has publicly declared himſelf a convert to Triennial Parliaments; and though I have long been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that this is the only poſſible reſource we have loft to preſerve the ſubſtantial freedom of the conſtitution, I do not think we have a right to determine againſt the integrity of Lord Rockingham or his friends. Other meaſures may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be ſupported in argument, as better adapted to the diſorder, or more likely to be obtained.</p>
               <p>Mr. Horne is well aſſured, that I never was the champion of Mr. Wilkes. But though I am not obliged to anſwer for the firmneſs of his future adherence to the principles he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, I have no reaſon to preſume that he will hereafter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace them. As for all thoſe imaginary caſes which Mr. Horne ſo petulantly urges againſt me, I have one plain, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt anſwer to make him.—Whenever Mr. Wilkes ſhall be convicted of ſoliciting a penſion, an embaſſy, or a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he muſt depart from that ſituation, and renounce that character, which he aſſumes at preſent, and which, in <hi>my</hi> opinion, entitle him to the ſupport of the public. By the ſame act, and at the ſame moment, he will forfeit his power of mortifying the King; and though he can never be a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite at St. James's, his baſeneſs may adminiſter a ſolid ſatisfaction to the royal mind. The man I ſpeak of has not a heart to feel for the frailties of his fellow-creatures. It is their virtues that afflict, it is their vices that conſole, him.</p>
               <p>I give every poſſible advantage to Mr. Horne, when I take the facts he refers to for granted. That they are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of his invention, ſeems highly probable; that they are
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:023477_0230_0FBFB0A8AA8E97A0"/>exaggerated, I have no doubt. At the worſt, what do they amount to, but that Mr. Wilkes, who never was thought of as a perf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ct pattern of morality, has not been at all times proof againſt the extremity of diſtreſs? How ſhameful is it, in a man who has lived in friendſhip with him, to reproach him with failings too naturally connected with deſpair! Is no allowance to be made for baniſhment and ruin? Does a two years impriſonment make no atonement for his crimes? The reſentment of a prieſt is implacable. No ſufferings can ſoften, no penitence can appeaſe, him.—Yet he himſelf, I think, upon his own ſyſtem, has a multitude of political of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences to atone for. I will not inſiſt upon the nauſeous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail, with which he ſo long diſguſted the public. He ſeems to be aſhamed of it. But what excuſe will he make to the friends of the conſtitution for labouring to promote <hi>this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummately bad man</hi> to a ſtation of the higheſt national truſt and importance? Upon what honorable motives did he recommend him to the livery of London for their repreſentative;—to the ward of Faringdon for their alderman;—to the county of Middleſex for their knight? Will he affirm, that, at that time, he was ignorant of Mr. Wilkes's ſolicitations to the miniſtry? —That he ſhould ſay ſo, is indeed very neceſſary for his own juſtification; but where will he find credulity to believe him?</p>
               <p>In what ſchool this gentleman learned his ethics, I know <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. His <hi>logic</hi> ſeems to have been ſtudied under Mr. Dyſon. That miſerable pamphleteer. by dividing the only precedent in point, and taking as much of it as ſuited his purpoſe, had reduced his argument upon the Middleſex election to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like the ſhape of a ſyllogiſm, Mr. Horne has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted himſelf with the ſame ingenuity and candour. I had affirmed, that Mr. Wilkes would preſerve the public favour, <q>
                     <g ref="char:startq">“</g>as long as he ſtood forth againſt a miniſtry and parliament who were doing every thing they could to enſlave the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, <g ref="char:endq">”</g>
                     <hi>and</hi> as long as he was a thorn in the King's ſide.</q> Yet, from the exulting triumph of Mr. Horne's reply, one would think that I had reſted my expectation, that Mr. Wilkes would be ſupported by the public upon the ſingle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of his mortifying the King. This may be logic at Cambridge or at the Treaſury; but among men of ſenſe and honour, it is folly or villany in the extreme.</p>
               <p>I ſee the pitiful advantage he has taken of a ſingle unguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed expreſſion, in a letter not intended for the public. Yet
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:023477_0231_0FBFB0AA2D190B40"/>it is only the <hi>expreſſion</hi> that is unguarded. I adhere to the true meaning of that member of the ſentence, taken ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as <hi>he</hi> takes it; and now; upon the cooleſt deliberation, re-aſſert, that, for the purpoſes I referred to, it may be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meritorious to the public, to wound the perſonal feelings of the Sovereign. It is not a general propoſition, not is it generally applied to the chief Magiſtrate of this or any other conſtitution. Mr. Horne knows as well as I do, that the beſt of Princes is not diſpleaſed with the abuſe which the ſees thrown upon his oſtenſible miniſter It makes them, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume. more properly the objects of his royal compaſſion;— neither does it eſcape his ſagacity, that the lower they are degraded in the public eſteem, the more ſubmiſſively they muſt depend upon his favour for protection. This I affirm, upon the moſt ſolemn conviction, and the moſt certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, is a leading maxim in the policy of the cloſet. It is unneceſſary to purſue the argument any farther.</p>
               <p>Mr. Horne is now a very loyal ſubject. He laments the wretched ſtate of politics in this country; and ſees, in a new light, the weakneſs and folly of the oppoſition. <hi>Whoever, or whatever, is Sovereign, demands the reſpect and ſupport of the people</hi>

               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  <date>AUGUST 26, 1771.</date>
               </opener>
               <p>THE enemies of the people, having now nothing better to object to my friend <hi>Junius,</hi> are at laſt obliged to quit his polities, and to rail at him for crimes he is not gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of. His vanity and impiety are now the perpetual to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics of their abuſe. I do not mean to leſſen the force of ſuch charges, (ſuppoſing they were true); but to ſhew that they are not founded. If I admitted the premiſes, I ſhould readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agree in all the conſequences drawn from them. Vanity indeed is a venial error; for it uſually carries its own puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with it:—but if I thought <hi>Junius</hi> capable of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>tering a diſreſpectful word of the religion of his country, I ſhould be the firſt to renounce and give him up to the public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and indignation. As a man, I am ſatisfied that he is a Chriſtian upon the moſt ſincere conviction: as a writer, he would be groſsly inconſiſtent with his political principles, if he dared to attack a religion eſtabliſhed by thoſe laws which it ſeems to be the purpoſe of his life to defend.—Now for the proofs.—<hi>Junius</hi> is accuſed of an impious alluſion to the holy ſacrament, where he ſays, that <hi>if Lord W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ymmth be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied the cup, there will be no keeping him within the pale of the miniſtry.</hi> Now, Sir, I affirm, that this paſſage refers entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a ceremonial in the Roman-Catholic church, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies the cup to the laity. It has no manner of relation to the Proteſtant creed; and is in this country as fair and object of ridicule as <hi>tranſubſtantiation,</hi> or any other part of Lord <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s hiſtory in the tale of the tub.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Junius</hi> is charged with equal vanity and impiety, in comparing his writings to the holy ſcripture.—The formal proteſt he makes againſt any ſuch compariſon avails him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. It becomes neceſſary, then, to ſhow that the charge deſtroys itſelf.—If he be <hi>vain,</hi> he cannot be <hi>impious.</hi> A vain man does not uſually compare himſelf to an object which it is his deſign to undervalue. On the other hand, if he be <hi>impious,</hi> he cannot be <hi>vain;</hi> for his impiety, if any, muſt conſiſt in his endeavouring to degrade the holy ſcriptures by a compariſon with his own contemptible writings. This
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:023477_0233_0FBFB0ADE3B4DA98"/>would be folly indeed of the groſſeſt nature; but where lies the vanity?—I ſhall now be told,—<q>Sir, what you ſay is <g ref="char:startq">“</g>plauſible enough; but ſtill you moſt allow that it is ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully impudent in <hi>Junius</hi> to tell us that his works will live <g ref="char:endq">”</g>as long as the Bible,</q> My anſwer is, <hi>Agreed; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               <p>THE people of England are not appriſed of the full ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of their obligations to you. They have yet no adequate idea of the endleſs variety of your character. They have ſeen you diſtinguiſhed and ſucceſsful in the continued violation of thoſe moral and political duties, by which the little as w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

With a rate of abilities which Lord Weymouth very juſtly Lows down upon with contempt, you have done as much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to the community as <hi>Cromwell</hi> would have done. if

                     </gap>well</hi> had been a coward; and as much as <hi>Machiavel,</hi> if <hi>Machiavel</hi> had not known that an appearance of morals and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are uſeful in ſociety. To a thinking man, the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the crown will, in no view, appear of formidable, as when he obſerves to what enormous ſucceſſes it has ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted your Grace, without a ray of real underſtanding, without even the pretenſions to common decency or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of any kind, or a ſingle ſpark of perſonal reſolution. What muſt be the operation of that pernicious influence, (for which our kings have wiſely exchanged the nugatory name of prerogative.) that, in the higheſt ſtations, can ſo abundantly ſupply the abſence of virtue, courage, and abilities, and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify a man to be the miniſter of a great nation, whom a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate gentleman would be aſhamed and afraid to admit into his family! Like the univerſal paſſport of an ambaſſador, it ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percedes the prohibition of the laws, baniſhes the ſtaple vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the country, and introduces vice an folly triumphant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into all the departments of the ſtate. Other princes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides his Majeſty, have had the means of corruption within their reach; but they have uſed it with moderation. In for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, corruption was conſidered as a foreign auxiliary to government, and only called in upon extraordinary emergencies. The unfeigned piety, the ſanctified religion, of <hi>George the Third,</hi> have taught him to new-model the civil forces of the ſtate. The natural reſources of the crown are no longer confided in. Corruption glitters in the van; collects and maintains a ſtanding army of mercenaries, and at the ſame moment impoveriſhes and enſlaves the country. His majeſty's predeceſſors (excepting that worthy family from which you, my Lord, are unqueſtionably deſcended) had ſome generous qualities in their compoſition, with vices, I confeſs, or frailties, in abundance. They were kings or gentlemen, not hypocrites or prieſts. They were at the head of the church, but did not know the value of their office. They ſaid their prayers without ceremony; and had too little prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft in their underſtanding to reconcile the ſanctimonious forms of religion with the utter deſtruction of the morality of their people.—My Lord, this is fact, not declamation. With all your partiality to the houſe of <hi>Stuart.</hi> you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that even <hi>Charles the Second</hi> would have bluſhed at that open encouragement, at thoſe eager, meretricious careſſes, with which very ſpecies of private vice and public proſtitution is
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:023477_0236_0FBFB0BBB6A34E00"/>received at St. James's.—The unfortunate houſe of <hi>Stuart</hi> has been treated with an aſperity which, if compariſon be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, ſeems to border upon injuſtice. Neither <hi>Charles</hi> not his brother were qualified to ſupport ſuch a ſyſtem of meaſures as would be neceſſary to change the government and ſubve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> the conſtitution of England. One of them was too much in earneſt in his pleaſures—the other in his religion. But the danger to this county would ceaſe to be problematical, if the crown ſhould ever deſcend to a Prince, whoſe apparent ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity might throw his ſubjects off their guard,—who might be no libertine in behaviour,—who ſhould have no ſenſe of honour to reſtrain him.—and who, with juſt religion enough to impoſe upon the multitude, might have no ſcruples of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to interfere with his morality. With theſe honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able qualifications, and the deciſive advantage of ſituation, low craft, and falſehood, are all the abilities that are wanting to deſtroy the wiſdom of ages, and to deface the nobleſt monument that human policy has erected.—I know <hi>ſuch</hi> a man:—My Lord, I know you both; and with the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God (for I too am religious,) the people of England ſhall know you as well as I do. I am not very ſure that great abilities would not in effect be an impediment to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, which ſeems at firſt ſight to require a ſuperior capacity. A better underſtanding might make him ſenſible of the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful beauty of that ſyſtem he was endeavouring to corrupt. The danger of the attempt might alarm him. The meanneſs and intrinſic worthleſſneſs of the object. (ſuppoſing he could attain it.) would fill him with ſhame. repentance and diſguſt. But theſe are ſenſations which find no entrance into a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous contracted heart. In ſome men, there is a malignant paſſion to deſtroy the works of genius, literature, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The Vandal and the Monk find equal gratification in it.</p>
               <p>Reflections like theſe, my Lord, have a general relation to your Grace, and inſeparably attend you in whatever compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or ſituation your character occurs to us. They have no immediate connection with the following recent fact, which I lay before the public, for the honour of the beſt of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns, and for the edification of his people.</p>
               <p>A Prince, (whoſe piety and ſelf-denial, one would think, might ſecure him from ſuch a multitude of worldly neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,) with an annual revenue of near a million ſterling, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately <hi>wants money.</hi>—The navy of England, by an equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:023477_0237_0FBFB0C01CCEA628"/>ſtrange concurrence of unforeſeen circumſtances, (though not quite ſo unfortunately for his Majeſty,) is in equal want of timber. The world knows in what a hopeful condition you delivered the navy to your ſucceſſor. and in what a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition we found it in the moment of diſtreſs. You were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined it ſhould continue in the ſituation in which you left it. It happened, however, very luckily for the privy-parſe, that one of the above wants promiſed fair to ſupply the other. Our religious, benevolent, generous Sovereign, has no objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to felling <hi>his own</hi> timber to <hi>his own</hi> admiralty to repair <hi>his own</hi> ſhips, not to putting the money into <hi>his own</hi> pocket. People of a religious turn naturally adhere to the principles of the church. Whatever they acquire falls into <hi>mort-main.</hi> Upon a repreſentation from the admiralty of the extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry want of timber for the indiſpenſable repairs of the navy, the ſurveyor-general was directed to make a ſurvey of the timber in all the royal chaces and foreſts in England. Having obeyed his orders with accuracy and attention, he reported, that the fineſt timber he had any where met with, and the propereſt in every reſpect for the purpoſes of the navy, was in <hi>Wittlebury Foreſt,</hi> of which your Grace, I think, is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary ranger. In conſequence of this report, the uſual war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant was prepared at the treaſury, and delivered to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor, by which he or his deputy were authoriſed to cot down any trees in <hi>Wittlebury Foreſt</hi> which ſhould appear to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the purpoſes above-mentioned. The deputy, being informed that the warrant was ſigned and delivered to his principal in London, croſſes the country to Northampton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, and with an officious zeal for the public ſervice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to do his duty in the foreſt. Unfortunately for him, he had not the warrant in his pocket. The overſight was enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous; and you have puniſhed him for it accordingly. You have inſiſted, that an active, uſeful officer ſhould be diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed family.—In what language ſhall I addreſs ſo black, ſo cowardly, a tyrant;—thou worſe than <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wicks,</hi> and all the <hi>Stuarts!</hi>—To them who know Lord North, it is unneceſſary to ſay, that he was mean and baſe enough to ſubmit to you.—This, however, is but a ſmall part of the fact. After ruining the ſurveyor's deputy for acting without the warrant, you att<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

The very reverſe of what you have aſſerted upon your honour is the truth. The grant, <hi>expreſsly, and by a particular clauſe,</hi> reſerves the property of the timber for the uſe of the crown.—In ſpite of this evidence,—in defiance of the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of the admiralty,—in perfect mockery of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious diſtreſſes of the Engliſh navy, and thoſe equally preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and almoſt equally notorious neceſſities of your pious Sovereign,—here the matter reſts.—The lords of the treaſury recall their warrant; the deputy-ſurveyor is ruined for doing his duty;—Mr. John Pitt (whoſe name I ſuppoſe is offenſive to you) ſabmits to be brow-beaten and inſulted;—the oaks keep their ground;—the King is defrauded, and the navy of England may periſh for want of the beſt and fineſt timber in the iſland. And all this is ſubmitted to—to appeaſe the Duke of Grafton!—to gratify the man who has involved the King and his kingdom in confuſion and diſtreſs, and who, like a treacherous coward, deſerted his Sovereign in the midſt of it!</p>
               <p>There has been a ſtrange alteration in your doctrines, ſince you thought it adviſeable to rob the <hi>Duke of P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

The fundamental principles of Chriſtianity may ſtill be preſerved, though every zealous ſectary adheres to his own excluſive doctrine, and pious ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtics make it part of their religion to perſecute one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. —The civil conſtitution too, that legal liberty, that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral creed which every Engliſhman profeſſes, may ſtill be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, though Wilkes, and Horne, and Townſhend, and Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, ſhould obſtinately refuſe to communicate; and even if the fathers of the church, if Saville, Richmond, Camden, Rockingham, and Chatham, ſhould diſagree in the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of their political worſhip, and even in the interpretation of twenty texts in Magna Charta.—I ſpeak to the people as one of the people.—Let us employ theſe men in whatever departments their various abilities are beſt ſuited to, and as much to the advantage of the common cauſe as their different inclinations will permit. They cannot ſerve <hi>us,</hi> without eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially ſerving themſelves.</p>
               <p>If Mr. <hi>Naſh</hi> be elected, he will hardly venture, after ſo recent a mark of the perſonal eſteem of his fellow-citizens, to declare himſelf immediately a courtier. The ſpirit and activity of the ſheriffs, will, I hope, be ſufficient to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act any ſiniſter intentions of the Lord Mayor. In colliſion with <hi>their</hi> virtue, perhaps he may take fire.</p>
               <p>It is not neceſſary to exact from Mr. Wilkes the virtues of a Stoic. They were inconſiſtent with themſelves, who, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at the ſame moment, repreſented him as the baſeſt of mankind, yet ſeemed to expect from him ſuch inſtances of fortitude and ſelf-denial as would do honour to an apoſtle. It is not however flattery to ſay, that he is obſtinate, intrepid, and fertile in expedients.—That he has no poſſible reſource, but in the public favour, is, in my judgment, a conſiderable recommendation of him. I wiſh that every man who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to popularity were in the ſame predicament. I wiſh that a retreat to St. James's were not ſo eaſy and open as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots have found it. To Mr. Wilkes there is no acceſs. However he may be miſſed by paſſion or imprudence, I think he cannot be guilty of a deliberate treachery to the public. The favour of this country conſtitutes the ſhield which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:023477_0243_0FBFB0D968ED3410"/>him againſt a thouſand daggers. Deſertion would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm him.</p>
               <p>I can more readily admire the liberal ſpirit and integrity, than the found judgment of any man who prefers a repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican form of government, in this or any other empire of equal extent, to a monarchy ſo qualified and limited as ours. I am convinced, that neither is it in theory the wiſeſt ſyſtem of government, nor practicable in this country. Yet, though I hope the Engliſh conſtitution will for ever preſerve its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal monarchial form, I would have the manners of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple purely and ſtrictly republican.—I do not mean the licenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirit of anarchy and riot.—I mean a general attachment to the common-weal, diſtinct from any partial attachment to perſons or families;—an implicit ſubmiſſion to the laws only, and an affection to the magiſtrate, proportioned to the inre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and wiſdom with which he diſtributes juſtice to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and adminiſters their affairs. The preſent habit of our political body appears to me the very reverſe of what it ought to be. The form of the conſtitution leans rather more than enough to the popular branch; while, in effect, the manners of the people (of thoſe at leaſt who are likely to take a lead in the country) incline too generally to a dependence upon the crown. The real friends of arbitrary power combine the facts, and are not inconſiſtent with their principles, when they ſtrenuouſly ſupport the unwarrantable privileges aſſumed by the Houſe of Commons.—In theſe circumſtance, it were much to be deſired, that we had many ſuch men as Mr. Saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge to repreſent us in Parliament.—I ſpeak from common report and opinion only, when I impute to him a ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive predilection in favour of a republic.—In the perſonal conduct and manners of the man, I cannot be miſtaken. He has ſhown himſelf poſſeſſed of hat republican firmneſs which the times require; and by which an Engliſh gentleman may be as uſefully and as honourably diſtinguiſhed, as any cirizen of ancient Rome, of Athens, or Laced<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>cult to trace the artifices which have ſuggeſted to him a language ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of his underſtanding. A great man commands the affections of the people. A prudent man does not complain when he has loſt them. Yet they are far from being loſt to Mr. Townſhend. He has treated our opinion a little too
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:023477_0244_0FBFB0DB13919138"/>cavalierly. A young man is apt to rely too confidently up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf, to be as attentive to his miſtreſs as a polite and paſſionate lover ought to be. Perhaps he found her at firſt too eaſy a conqueſt.—Yet, I fancy, ſhe will be ready to receive him, whenever he thinks proper to renew his addreſſes. With all his youth, his ſpirit, and his appearance, it would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decent in the lady to ſolicit his return.</p>
               <p>I have too much reſpect for the abilities of Mr. Horne, to flatter myſelf that theſe gentlemen will ever be cordially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united. It is not, however, unreaſonable to expect, that each of them ſhould act his ſeparate part with honour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity to the public.—As for the differences of opinion upon ſpeculative queſtions, if we wait until <hi>they</hi> are reconciled, the action of human affairs muſt be ſuſpended for ever. But nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are we to look for perfection in any one man, nor for agreement among many.—When <hi>Lord Chatham</hi> affirms, that the authority of the Britiſh Legiſlature is not ſupreme over the colonies in the ſame ſenſe in which it is ſupreme over Great Britain;—when <hi>Lord Camden</hi> ſuppoſes a neceſſity, (which the King is to judge of,) and, founded upon that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, attributes to the crown a legal power (not given by the act itſelf) to ſuſpend the operation of an act of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature —I liſten to them both with diffidence and reſpect, but without the ſmalleſt degree of conviction or aſſent.

I lament the unhappy neceſſity, whenever it ariſes, of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for the ſafety of the ſubject. Would to God it were practicable to reconcile theſe important objects, in every poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſituation of public affairs!—I regard the legal liberty of the meaneſt man in Britain as much as my own, and would defend it with the ſame zeal. I know we muſt ſtand or fail together. But I never can doubt, that the community has a right to command, as well as to purchaſe, the ſervice of its members.—I ſee that right founded originally upon a neceſſity which ſupercedes all argument. I ſee it eſtabliſhed by uſage immemorial, and admitted by more than a tacit aſſent of the legiſlature. I conclude there is no remedy, in the nature of things, for the grievance complained of; for, if there
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:023477_0245_0FBFB0DC63B88BE8"/>were, it muſt long ſince have been redreſſed. Though num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs opportunities have preſented themſelves, highly favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to public liberty, no ſucceſsful attempt has ever been made for the relief of the ſubject in this article. Yet it has been felt and complained of ever ſince England had a navy. The conditions which conſtitute this right, muſt be taken to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Separately, they have little weight. It is not fair to argue, from any abuſe in the execution, to the illegality of the power; much leſs is a concluſion to be drawn from the navy to the land-ſervice. A ſeaman can never be employed but againſt the enemies of his country. The only caſe in which the King can have a right to arm his ſubjects in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, is that of a foreign force being actually landed upon our coaſt. Whenever that caſe happens, no true Engliſhman will inquire whether the King's right to compel him to defend his country, be the cuſtom of England, or a grant of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. With regard to the preſs for ſeamen, it does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the ſymptoms may not be ſoftened, although the diſtemper cannot be cured. Let bounties be increaſed as fat as the public perſe can ſupport them. Still they have a limit; and, when every reaſonable expence is incurred, it will be found, in fact, that the ſpur of the preſs is wanted to give operation to the bounty.</p>

But, upon reflection, his conduct accounts naturally for itſelf. He knew the doctrine was unpopular, and was eager to fix it upon the man who is the firſt object of his fear and deteſtation. The cunning Scotchman never ſpeaks truth without a fraudulent deſign. In council, he generally affects to take a moderate part.

Lord Mansfield. There never exiſted a man but himſelf who anſwered exactly to ſo complicated a deſcription. compared to theſe enormities, his original attachment to the Pretender (to whom his deareſt brother was confidential ſecretary) is a virtue of the firſt magnitude.

In public affairs there is the leaſt chance of a perfect concurrence of ſentiment or inclination. Yet every man is able to contribute ſomething to the common ſtock; and no man's contribution ſhould be rejected. If individuals have no virtues, their vices may be of uſe to us.

Our dogs and horſes are only Engliſh upon Engliſh ground; but patriotiſm, it ſeems, may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by tranſplanting.—I will not reject a bill which tends to confine parliamentary privilege within reaſonable bounds, though it ſhould be ſtolen from the houſe of Cavendiſh, and introduced by Mr. Onſlow. The features of the infant are a proof of the deſcent, and vindicate the noble birth from the baſeneſs of the adoption I willingly accept of a ſarcaſm from <hi>Colonel Barré,</hi> or a ſimile from Mr. <hi>Burke.</hi> Even the ſilent vote of Mr. <hi>Calcraft</hi> is worth reckoning in a diviſion. What though he riots in the plunder of the army, and has on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determined to be a patriot when he could not be a peer! Let us profit by the aſſiſtance of ſuch men while they are with us, and place them, if it be poſſible, in the poſt of danger, to prevent deſertion.—The wary <hi>Wedderburne,</hi> the pompous <hi>Suffolk,</hi> never threw away the ſcabbard, nor ever went upon a forlorn hope.

               <p>I AM convinced that <hi>Junius</hi> is incapable of wilfully miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting any man's opinion, and that his inclination leads him to treat <hi>Lord Camden</hi> with particular candour and reſpect. The doctrine attributed to him by <hi>Junius,</hi> as far as it goes, correſponds with that ſtated by your correſpondent <hi>Scaevola,</hi> who ſeems to make a diſtinction without a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. <hi>Lord Camden,</hi> it is agreed, did certainly maintain, that, in the receſs of Parliament, the King (by which we all mean the <hi>King in council,</hi> or the executive power) might ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the operation of an act of the Legiſlature; and he found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his doctrine upon a ſuppoſed neceſſity, of which the King, <hi>in the firſt inſtance,</hi> muſt be judge. The lords and commons
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:023477_0249_0FBFB0ECB96B0D08"/>cannot be judges of it is. the firſt inſtance, for they do not exiſt.—Thun far <hi>Junius.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But. ſays <hi>Scaevola, Lord Camden</hi> made <hi>Parliament,</hi> and not the <hi>King,</hi> judges of the neceſſity.—That Parliament may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view the acts of miniſters, is unqueſtionable; but there is a wide difference between ſaying that the crown has a <hi>legal</hi> power, and that miniſters may act <hi>at their peril.</hi> When we ſay that an act is <hi>illegal,</hi> we mean that it is forbidden by a joint reſolution of the three eſtates. How a ſubſequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of two of thoſe branches can make it <hi>legal ab initio,</hi> will require explanation. If it could, the conſequence would be truly dreadful, eſpecially in theſe times. There is no act of arbitrary power which the King might not attribute to <hi>neceſſity,</hi> and for which he would not be ſecure of obtaining the approbation of his proſtituted lords and commons. If <hi>Lord Camden</hi> admits that the ſubſequent ſanction of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was neceſſary to make the proclamation <hi>legal,</hi> why did he ſo obſtinately oppoſe the bill which was ſoon after brought in for indemnifying all thoſe perſons who had acted under it?—If that bill had not been paſſed, I am ready to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, in direct contradiction to Lord Camden's doctrine, (taken as <hi>Scaevola</hi> ſtates it) that a litigious exporter of corn, who had ſuffered in his property in conſequence of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, might have laid his action againſt the cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe officers, and would infallibly have recovered damages. No jury could refuſe them; and if I, who am by no means litigious, had been ſo injured, I would aſſuredly have inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted of right. I would have done it upon a principle of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of the pretended power of either or both houſes to make declarations inconſiſtent with law; and I have no doubt that, with an act of Parliament on my ſide, I ſhould have been too ſtrong for them all. This is the way in which an Engliſhman ſhould ſpeak and act; and not ſuffer dangerous precedents to be eſtabliſhed, becauſe the circumſtances are favourable or palliating.</p>
               <p>With regard to <hi>Lord Camden,</hi> the truth is, that he inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertently overſhot himſelf, as appears plainly by that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded mention of <hi>a tyranny of forty days,</hi> which I myſelf heard. Inſtead of aſſerting that the proclamation was <hi>legal,</hi> he <hi>ſhould</hi> have ſaid, <q>My lords, I know the proclamation <g ref="char:startq">“</g>was <hi>illegal;</hi> but I adviſed it becauſe it was indiſpenſably
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:023477_0250_0FBFB0EDB8868520"/>neceſſary to ſave the kingdom from famine; and I ſubmit <g ref="char:endq">”</g>myſelf to the juſtice and mercy of my country.</q>

               <p>THE ſophiſtry of your letter in defence of Lord <hi>Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</hi> is adapted to the character you defend. But Lord <hi>Mansfield</hi> is a man of form, and ſeldom in his behaviour tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſes the rules of decorum. I ſhall imitate his Lordſhip's good manners, and leave you in full poſſeſſion of his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. I will not call you <hi>liar, jeſuit,</hi> or <hi>villain;</hi> but, with all the politeneſs imaginable, perhaps I may prove you ſo.</p>

If I am candid enough to admit that this is the very logic taught at <hi>St. Omer</hi>'s, you will readily allow that it is the conſtant practice in the court of King's-bench, —JUNIUS <hi>does not ſay,</hi> that he never had a doubt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout

               <p>
                  <hi>Junius</hi> did <hi>not</hi> ſay that Lord Mansfield had adviſed the calling out the Guards. On the contrary, his plain mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that he left that odious office to men leſs cunning than himſelf.—Whether Lord Mansfield's doctrine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing libels be or be not an attack upon the liberty of the preſs, is a queſtion which the public in general are very well able to determine. I ſhall not enter into it at preſent. Not do I think it neceſſary to ſay much to a man, who had the daring confidence to ſay to a jury. <q>Gentlemen you are to bring <g ref="char:startq">“</g>in a verdict <hi>guilty</hi> or <hi>not guilty;</hi> but whether the defendant be guilty or innocent, is not matter for <hi>your</hi> conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.<g ref="char:endq">”</g>
                  </q> Clothe it in what language you will, this is the ſum total of Lord Mansfield's doctrine. If not, let <hi>Zeno</hi> ſhow us the difference.</p>
               <p>But it ſeems <hi>the liberty of the preſs may be abuſed;</hi> and <hi>the abuſe of a valuable privilege is the certain means to loſe it.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> I admit:—but let the <hi>abuſe</hi> be ſubmitted to a jury; a ſufficient, and indeed the only legal and conſtitutional check upon the licence of the preſs. The <hi>ſecond</hi> I flatly deny. In direct contradiction to Lord Mansfield, I affirm, <q>that the <g ref="char:startq">“</g>abuſe of a valuable privilege <hi>is not</hi> the <hi>certain</hi> means to loſe <g ref="char:endq">”</g>it.</q> If it were, the Engliſh nation would have few pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges left; for where is the privilege that has not, at one time or other, been abuſed by individuals? But it is falſe in reaſon and equity, that particular abuſes ſhould produce a general forfeiture. Shall the community by deprived of the protection of the laws, becauſe there are robbers and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers? —Shall the community be puniſhed, becauſe indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als have offended? Lord Mansfield ſays ſo, conſiſtently enough with his principles; but I wonder to find him ſo explicit. Yet, for one conceſſion, however extorted. I confeſs myſelf obliged to him:—The liberty of the preſs is after all a <hi>valuable
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:023477_0252_0FBFB0F5EF5AE4F0"/>privilege.</hi> I agree with him moſt heartily, and will defend it againſt him.</p>
               <p>You aſk me, What <hi>juryman</hi> was challenged by Lord Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field? I tell you his name is <hi>Benſon.</hi> When his name was called, Lord Mansfield ordered the clerk to paſs him by. As for his reaſons, you may aſk himſelf, for he aſſigned none: but I can tell you what all men thought of it. This <hi>Benſon</hi> had been refractory upon a former jury, and would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the law as delivered by Lord Mansfield; but had the impudence to pretend to think for himſelf.—But you, it ſeems honeſt <hi>Zeno,</hi> know nothing of the matter. You ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read <hi>Junius</hi>'s letter to your patron: You never heard of the intended inſtructions from the city to impeach Lord Mansfield You never heard by what dexterity of Mr. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſon</hi> that meaſure was prevented. How wonderfully ill ſome people are informed!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Junius</hi> did <hi>never</hi> affirm, that the crime of ſeducing the wife of a mechanic or a peer, is not the ſame, taken in a moral or religious view. What he affirmed, in contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the levelling principle ſo lately adopted by Lord Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, was, <hi>that the damages ſhould be proportioned to the rank and fortune of the parties;</hi> and for this plain reaſon, (admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by every other judge that ever ſat in Weſtminſter-hall), becauſe, what is a compenſation or penalty to one man, is none to another. The ſophiſtical diſtinction you attempt to draw between the perſon <hi>injured</hi> and the perſon <hi>injuring,</hi> is <hi>Mansfield</hi> all over. If you can once eſtabliſh the propoſition, that the injured party is not entitled to <hi>receive</hi> large damages, it follows pretty plainly, that the party <hi>injuring</hi> ſhould not be compelled to <hi>pay</hi> them; conſequently the King's brother is effectually ſcreened by Lord <hi>Mansfield</hi>'s doctrine. Your reference to <hi>Nathan</hi> and <hi>David</hi> come naturally in aid of your patron's profeſſed ſyſtem of juriſprudence. He is food of introducing into the <hi>court of King's-bench</hi> any law that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts or excludes the common law of England; whether it be <hi>canon, civil, jus gentium,</hi> or <hi>levitical.</hi> But, Sir, the bible is the code of out religious faith, not of our municipal ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſprudence; and though it was the pleaſure of God to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict a particular puniſhment upon David's crime (taken as a breach of his divine commands), and to ſend his prophet to denounce it, an Engliſh jury have nothing to do either with David or the prophet. They conſider the crime only as it
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:023477_0253_0FBFB0F8D10ADAA0"/>is a breach of order, an injury to an individual, and an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to ſociety; and they judge of it by certain poſitive rules of law, or by the practice of their anceſtors. Upon the whole, the man <hi>after God's own heart</hi> is much indented to you for comparing him to the Duke of Cumberland. That his Royal Highneſs may be the man after Lord <hi>Mansfield</hi>'s own heart, ſeems much more probable; and you, I think, Mr. <hi>Zeno,</hi> might ſucceed tolerably well in the character of <hi>Nathan.</hi> The evil deity, the prophet, and the royal ſinner, would be very proper company for one another.</p>
               <p>You ſay Lord Mansfield did not <hi>make</hi> the commiſſioners of the great ſeal, and that he only <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the King to appoint. I believe <hi>Junius</hi> meant no more; and the diſtinction is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly worth diſputing.</p>
               <p>You ſay he <hi>did not</hi> deliver an opinion upon Lord Chatham's appeal,—I affirm that he <hi>did,</hi> directly in favour of the appeal. This is a point of fact, to he determined by evidence only. But you aſſign no reaſon for his ſuppoſed thence, nor for his deſiring a conference with the judges the day before. Was not all Weſtminſter-hall convinced that he did it with a view to puzzle them with ſome perplexing queſtion, and in hopes of bringing ſome of them over to him?—You ſay the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners were <hi>very capable of framing a decree for themſelves.</hi> By the fact, it only appears, that they were capable of fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming an <hi>illegal</hi> one; which I apprehend, is not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>uch to the credit either of their learning or integrity.</p>
               <p>We are both agreed, that <hi>Lord Mansfield</hi> has inceſſantly laboured to introduce new modes of proceeding in the court where he preſides; but <hi>you</hi> attribute it to an honeſt real in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of innocence oppreſſed by quibble and chicane. I ſay, that he has introduced <hi>new law</hi> too, and removed the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks eſtabliſhed by former deciſions. I ſay, that his view is to change a court of common law into a court of equity, and to bring every thing within the <hi>arbitrium</hi> of a <hi>praetorian</hi> court. The public muſt determine between us. <hi>But, now for his merits. Firſt,</hi> then, the eſtabliſhment of the judges in their places for life, (which you tell us was adviſed by Lord <hi>Mansfield,</hi>) was a conceſſion merely to catch the people. It bore the appearance of a royal bounty, but had nothing real in it. The judges were already for life, excepting in the caſe of a <hi>demiſe.</hi> Your boaſted bill only provides, that it ſhall not be in the power of the King's ſucceſſor to remove them. At
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:023477_0254_0FBFB0F9A0E68BE0"/>the beſt, therefore, it is only a legacy, not a gift, on the part of his preſent majeſty, ſince or himſelf he gives up nothing. That he did oppoſe Lord <hi>Camden</hi> and Lord <hi>Northington</hi> upon the proclamation againſt the exportation of corn, is moſt true, and with great ability. With his talents, and taking the right ſide of ſo clear a queſtion, it was impoſſible to ſpeak ill.—His motives are not ſo eaſily penetrated. They who are acquainted with the ſtate of polities at that period, will judge of them ſomewhat differently from <hi>Zeno.</hi> Of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular bills, which you ſay he ſupport<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4to, With regard to the <hi>Groſvenor cauſe,</hi> it is pleaſant to obſerve, that the doctrine, attributed by <hi>Junius</hi> to Lord Mansfield, is admitted by <hi>Zeno,</hi> and directly defended. The <hi>Barriſter</hi> has not the aſſurance to deny it flatly; but he evades the charge, and ſoftens the doctrine by ſuch poor contemptible quibbles as cannot impoſe upon the meaneſt underſtanding.</p>
               <p n="5">5to, The quantity of buſineſs in the <hi>court of King's bench</hi> prove nothing but the litigious ſpirit of the people, ariſing from the great increaſe of wealth and commerce. Theſe, however, are now upon the decline, and will ſoon leave no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but <hi>law-ſuits</hi> behind them. When <hi>Junius</hi> affirms that Lord Mansfield has laboured to alter the ſyſtem of juriſpru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the court where his Lordſhip preſides, he ſpeaks to thoſe who are able to look a little farther than the vulgar. Beſides that the multitude are eaſily deceived by the impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing names of <hi>equity</hi> and <hi>ſubſtantial juſtice,</hi> it does not follow, that a judge, who introduces into his court new modes of proceeding and new principles of law, intends, <hi>in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,</hi> to decide unjuſtly. Why ſhould he, where he ha no intereſt?—We ſay that Lord Mansfield is a bad <hi>man,</hi> and a

The truth of the matter is plainly this. When <hi>Lord Mansfield</hi> has ſucceeded in his ſcheme of changing a court of <hi>common law</hi> to a court of <hi>equity,</hi> he will have it in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to do injuſtice <hi>whenever he thinks proper.</hi> This, though a wicked purpoſe, is neither abſurd nor unattainable.</p>

               <p>WE are deſired to make the following declaration, in behalf of <hi>Junius,</hi> upon three material points, on which is opinion has been miſtaken or miſrepreſented.</p>

                  </gap>, That, with regard to preſs-warrants, his argument ſhould be taken in his own words, and anſwered ſtrictly;— that compariſons may ſometimes illuſtrate, but prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing:
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:023477_0258_0FBFB1072F6C7CD8"/>and that, in this caſe, an appeal to the paſſions is unfair and unneceſſary. <hi>Junius</hi> feels and acknowledges the evil in the moſt expreſs terms, and will ſhow himſelf ready to concur in any rational plan that may provide for the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the individual, without hazarding the ſafety of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. At the ſame time, he expects that the evil, ſuch as it is, be not exaggerated or miſrepreſented. In general, it is <hi>not</hi> unjuſt, that when the rich man contributes his wealth, the <hi>poor</hi> man ſhould ſerve the ſtate in perſon; otherwiſe the latter contributes nothing to the defence of that law and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution from which he demands ſafety and protection. But the queſtion does not lie between <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>poor.</hi> The laws of England make no ſuch diſtinctions.

In this ſenſe the levy of <hi>ſhip-money</hi> by the King's warrant as not <hi>neceſſary,</hi> becauſe the buſineſs might have been as well or better done by Parliament. If the doctrine maintained by <hi>Junius</hi> be confined within this limitation, it will go but very little way in ſupport of arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power. That the King is to judge of the occaſion, is no objection, unleſs we are told how it can poſſibly be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. There are other inſtances, not leſs important in the exerciſe, nor leſs dangerous in the abuſe, in which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution relies entirely upon the King's judgement. The executive power proclaims war and peace, binds the nation by treaties, orders general embargoes, and impoſes quaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines; not to mention a multitude of prerogative writs, which, though liable to the greateſt abuſes, were never diſputed.</p>

                  </gap>, It has been urged as a reproach to <hi>Junius,</hi> that he has not delivered an opinion upon the Game Laws, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the late <hi>Dog-Act.</hi> But <hi>Junius</hi> thinks he has much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reaſon to complain, that he is never aſſiſted by thoſe who are able to aſſiſt him; and that almoſt the whole labour of the preſs is thrown upon a ſingle hand, from which a diſcuſſion of <hi>every</hi> public queſtion whatſoever is unreaſonably expected. He is not paid for his labour, and certainly has a right to chooſe his employment.—As to the <hi>Game Lows,</hi> he never ſcrupled to declare his opinion, that they are a ſpecies of the <hi>Foreſt Laws;</hi> that they are oppreſſive to the ſubject; and that the ſpirit of them is incompatible with legal liberty:—That the penalties impoſed by theſe laws bear no proportion to the nature of the offence; that the mode of trial, and the degree and kind of evidence neceſſary to convict, not only deprive the ſubject of all the benefits of a trial by jury, but are in themſelves too ſummary, and to the laſt degree arbitrary and oppreſſive: That, in particular, the late acts to prevent dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtealing, or killing game between ſun and ſun, are diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their abſurdity, extravagance, and pernicious tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. If theſe terms are weak or ambiguous, in what language can <hi>Junius</hi> expreſs himſelf?—It is no excuſe for Lord Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field to ſay, that he <hi>happened</hi> to be abſent when theſe bills paſſed the Houſe of Lords. It was his duty to be preſent. Such bills could never have paſſed the Houſe of Commons without his knowledge. But we very well know by what rule be regulates his attendance. When that order was made in the Houſe of Lords in the caſe of <hi>Lord Pomfret,</hi> at which every Engliſhman ſhudders, my honeſt Lord Mansfield found himſelf, <hi>by more accident,</hi> in the court of King's-bench:—O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe he would have done wonders in defence of law and property! The pitiful evaſion is adapted to the character. But <hi>Junius</hi> will never juſtify himſelf by the example of this had man. The diſtinction between <hi>doing wrong,</hi> and <hi>avoiding to do right,</hi> belongs to Lord Mansfield. <hi>Junius</hi> diſclaims it.</p>

               <p>WHAT is the reaſon, my Lord, that when almoſt every man in the kingdom, without diſtinction of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples or party, exults in the ridiculous defeat of Sir James Lowther: when good and bad men unite in one common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of that Baronet, and triumph in his diſtreſs, as if the event (without any reference to vice or virtue) were intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to human nature; your Grace alone ſhould appear ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably depreſſed and afflicted? In ſuch univerſal joy, I know not where you will look for a compliment of condolence, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you appeal to the tender, ſympathetic ſorrows of Mr. Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw. That cream-coloured gentleman's tears, affecting as they are carry conſolation with them. He never weeps, but, like an April ſhower, with a lambent ray of ſunſhine upon his countenance. From the feelings of honeſt men upon this joyful occaſion. I do not mean to draw any concluſion to your Grace. <hi>They</hi> naturally rejoice when they ſee a ſignal inſtance of tyranny reſided with ſucceſs;—of treachery ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the deriſion of the world;—an infamous informer defeated, and an impudent robber dragged to the public gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet. —But, in the <hi>other</hi> claſs of mankind, I own I expected to meet the Duke of Graſton. Men who have no regard for juſtice, nor any ſenſe of honour, ſeem as heartily pleaſed with Sir James Lowther's well-deſerved puniſhment, as if he did not conſtitute an example againſt themſelves. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Baronet has no friends, even among thoſe who reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble him. You, my Lord, are not reduced to ſo deplorable a ſtate of dereliction. Every villain in the kingdom is your friend; and, in compliment to ſuch amity, I think you ſhould ſuffer your diſmal countenance to clear up. Beſides, my Lord, I am a little anxious for the conſiſtency of your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. You violate your own rules of decorum, when you do not inſult the man whom you have betrayed.</p>
               <p>The divine juſtice of retribution ſeems now to have begun its progreſs. Deliberate treachery entails puniſhment upon the traitor. There is no poſſibility of eſcaping it, even in the higheſt rank to which the conſent of ſociety can exalt the
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:023477_0262_0FBFB1193A55A7A0"/>meaneſt and worſt of men. The forced, unnatural union of Louttrell and Middleſex, was an omen of another unnatural union, by which indefeaſible infamy is attached to the houſe of Brunſwick. If one of theſe acts was virtuous and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the beſt of Princes, I thank god, is happily rewarded for it by the other.—Your Grace, <hi>it has been ſaid,</hi> had ſome ſhare in recommending Colonel Luttrell to the King;—or was it only the gentle Bradſhaw who made himſelf anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the good behaviour of his friend? An intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection has long ſubſiſted between him and the worthy Lord Irnham. It aroſe from a fortunate ſimilarity of principles, comented by the conſtant meditation of their common friend Miſs Davis<note n="*" place="bottom">There is a certain family in this country, on which nature ſeems to have entailed an hereditory baſeneſs of diſpoſition. As far as their hiſtory has been known, the ſon has regularly improved upon the vices of his faither, and has taken care to tranſmit them pure and undiminiſhed into the bosom of his ſucceſſor. In the ſenate, their abilities have confined them to thoſe humble, ſordid ſervices in which the ſcavengers of the miniſtry are uſually employed. But, in the memoirs of private treachery, the ſtand firſt and unrivalled. The following ſtory will ſerve to illuſtrate the character of this reſpectable family, and to convince the world that the preſent poſſeſſor has as clear a title to the infamy of his anceſtors as he has to their eſtate. It deſerves to be recorded for the curioſity of the fact, and ſhould be given to the public as a warming to very honeſt member of ſociety.
<p>The preſent Lord Irnham, who is now in the decline of life, lately cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated the aquaintance of a younger brother of a family with which he had lived in ſome degree of intimacy and friendſhip. The young man had long been the dupe of a moſt unhappy attachment to a common proſtitute. His friends and relations foreſaw the conſequences of this connection, and did every thing that depended upon them to ſave him from ruin. But he had a friend in Lord Irnham, whoſe advice rendered all their endeavours ineffectual. This hoary lecher, not contented with the enjoyment of his friend's miſtreſs, was baſe enough to take advantage of the paſſions and folly of a young man, and perſuaded him to marry her. He deſcended even to perform the office of father to the proſtitute. He gave her to his friend, who was on the point of leaving the kingdom, and the next night lay with her himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Whether the depravity of the human heart can produce any thing more baſe and deteſtable than this fact, muſt be left undetermined, until the ſon ſhall arrive at the father's age and experience.</p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>Yet I confeſs I ſhould be ſorry that the opprobrious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy of this match ſhould reach beyond the family.—We have now a beter reaſon than ever to pray for the long life of the heſt of Princes, and the welfare of his royal <hi>iſſue.</hi>—I will not mix any thing ominous with my pravers;—but let Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament look to it.—A <hi>Luttrell</hi> ſhall never, ſucceed to the
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:023477_0263_0FBFB11BF13C4B38"/>crown of England.—If the hereditary virtues of the family de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a kingdom, Scot and will be a proper retreat for them.</p>

In the ſon-in-law of your deareſt friend the Earl of Bute von meant to transfer the Duke of Pertland's property; and you haltered the grant with an expedition unknown to the treaſon, that be might have it time enough to give a deciſive turn to the election for the county. The immediate conſequence of this flagitious robbery was, that he loſt the election which you meant to inſure to him, and with ſuch final circumſtances of ſcorn, reproach, and inſult (to ſave nothing of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral exultation of all parties) as (exce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To <hi>ſearch a grad</hi> beyond the reach of common treachery, is an exception, not a rule.</p>
               <p>And now, my good Lord, does not your conſcious hears inform you, that the juſtice of retribution begins to operate, and that it may ſoon approach your perſon?—Do you think that <hi>Junius</hi> has renounced the Middleſex election?—or that the King's timber ſhall be refuſed to the Royal Navy with impunity?—or that you ſhall hear no more of the ſale of that patent to Mr. <hi>Hine,</hi> which you endeavoured to ſcreen by ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly dropping your proſecution of <hi>Samme IV <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               <p>I HAVE undertaken to prove, that when, at the interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of three of your country men, you bailed <hi>John Eyre,</hi> you did that <hi>which by law you were not warranted to do;</hi> and that a felon, under the circumſtances <hi>of being taken in the fact, with the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d upon him, and making us defence, is not bail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able</hi> by the laws of England. Your learned advocates have interpreted this charge into a denial that the court of King's-bench or the judges of that court during the vacation, have any greater authority to bail for criminal offences than a juſtice of peace. With the inſtance before me, I am ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to queſtion your power of doing wrong, and to deny the exiſtence of a power at the ſame moment that I arraign the illegal exerciſe of it. But the opinions of ſuch men, whether wilful in their malignity, or ſincere in their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, are unworthy of my notice. You, Lord Mansfield, did not underſtand me ſo; and, I promiſe you, your cauſe requires an abler defence.—I am now to make good my charge againſt you. However dull my argument, the ſubject of it is intereſting. I ſhall be honoured with the attention of the public, and have a right to demand the attention of the legiſlature. Supported as I am by the whole body of the criminal law of England, I have no doubt of eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my charge. If, on your part, you ſhould have no plain, ſubſtantial defence, but ſhould endeavour to ſhelter yourſelf under the quirk and evaſion of a practiſing lawyer, or under the mere inſuiting aſſertion of power without right, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation you pretend to is gone for ever;—you ſtand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded from the reſpect and authority of your office, and are no longer, <hi>de jure,</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice of England. This letter, my Lord, is addreſſed, not ſo much to <hi>you.</hi> as to the public. Learned as you are, and quick in apprehenſion, few arguments are neceſſary to ſatisfy you, that you have done that which by law you were not warranted to do. Your conſcience already tells you, that you have ſinned againſt knowledge, and that whatever defence you make contradicts your own internal conviction. But other men
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:023477_0265_0FBFB11E6C6A3D40"/>are willing enough to take the law upon truſt. They rely upon your authority, becauſe they are too indolent to ſearch for information; or, conceiving that there is ſome myſtery in the laws of their county which lawyers only are quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to explain, they diſtruſt their judgment, and volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily renounce the right of thinking for themſelves. With all the evidence of hiſtory before them, from <hi>

Superſtition is certainly not the characteriſtic of this age. Yet ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

               <p>The charge I brought againſt you is expreſſed in terms guarded and well conſidered. They do not deny the ſtrict power of the judges of the chart of King's-bench to bail in caſes not bailable by a juſtice of the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </hi> by the ſheriff. I well know the practice of the court, and by what legal rules is ought to be directed. But, far from meaning to ſoften or diminiſh the force of thoſe terms I have made uſe of, I now go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them, and affirm,</p>
               <p n="1">I. That the ſuperior power of bailing for felony claimed by the court of King's-bench is founded upon the opinion of lawyers, and the practice of the court;—that the aſſent of the legiſlature to this power is merely negative, and that it is not ſupported by any poſitive proviſion in any ſtatute whatſoever—If it be, produce the ſtatute.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Admitting that the judges of the court of King's-bench are veſted with a diſcretionary power to examine and judge of circumſtances and allegations which a juſtice of peace is not permitted to conſider, I affirm that the judges, in the uſe and application of that diſcretionary power, are as ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bound by the ſpirit, intent, and meaning, as the juſtice of peace is by the words, of the legiſlature. Favourable circumſtances alleged before the judge, may juſtify a doubt whether the priſoner be guilty or not; and, where the guilt is doubtful, a preſumption of innocence ſhould, in general, be admitted. But, when any ſuch probable circumſtances are alleged, they alter the ſtate and condition of the priſoner.

               <p n="3">III. I affirm, that, according to the obvious indiſputable meaning of the legiſlature, repeatedly expreſſed, a perſon poſitively charged with <hi>

I know it has been alleged in your favour, that you have often bailed for murders, rapes, and other manifeſt crimes, Without queſtioning the fact, I ſhall not admit that you are to be juſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ed by your own example. If that were a protection to you, where is the crime, that, as a judge, you might not now ſecurely commit? But neither ſhall I ſuffer myſelf to be drawn aſide from my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſene argument, nor <hi>you</hi> to profit by your own wrong.—To
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:023477_0267_0FBFB127E1B5EDB8"/>prove the meaning and intent of the legiſlature, will require a minute and tedious deduction. To inveſtigate a queſtion of law, demands ſome labour and attention: though very little genius or ſagacity. As a practical profeſſion, the ſtudy of the law requires but a moderate portion of abilities. The learning of a pleader is uſually upon a level with his integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The indiſcriminate defence of right and wrong contracts the underſtanding, while it corrupts the heart. Subtlety is ſoon miſtaken for wiſdom, and impunity for virtue. If there be any inſtances upon record, as ſome there are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, of genius and morality united in a lawyer, they are diſtinguiſhed by their ſingularity, and operate as excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I muſt ſolicit the patience of my readers. This is no light matter; nor is it any more ſuſceptible of ornament, than the conduct of Lord Mansfield is capable of aggravation.</p>
               <p>As the law of bail, in charges of felony, has been exactly aſcertained by acts of the legiſlature, it is at preſent of little conſequences to inquire how it ſtood at common law before she ſtatute of Weſtminſter.

Otherwiſe, unleſs there was a poſitive exception of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior courts (which I affirm there never was in any ſtatute rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to bail,) the legiſlature would groſsly contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the manifeſt intention of the law be evaded.

Yet when the Houſe of Commons, which met in the year 1628, reſolved upon meaſures of the moſt firm and ſtrenuous reſiſtance to the power of impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſſumed by the King or privy-council, and to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal to bail the party on the return of the <hi>habeas corpus,</hi> they did expreſsly, in all their reſolutions, make an excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of commitments, where the cauſe of the reſtraint was expreſſed. and did by law juſtify the commitment. The reaſon of the diſtinction is, that whereas, when the cauſe of commitment is expreſſed, the crime is then known, and the offender muſt be brought to the ordinary trial; if, on the contrary, no cauſe of commitment be expreſſed, and the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner be thereupon remanded, it may operate to perpetual impriſonment. This conteſt with Charles the Firſt produced the act of the 16th of that King; by which the court of King's-bench are directed, within three days after the return to the <hi>habeas corpus,</hi> to examine and determine the legality of any commitment by the King or privy-council, and to do <hi>what to juſtice ſhall appertain,</hi> in delivering, bailing, or <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding</hi> the priſoner.—<hi>New,</hi> it ſeems, it is unneceſſary for the judge to do what appertains to juſtice. The ſame ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous traſſic, in which we have ſeen the privilege of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment exerted or relaxed, to gratify the preſent humour, or to ſerve the immediate purpoſe, of the crown, is introduced into the adminiſtration of juſtice.

               <p>To complete this hiſtorical inquiry, it only remains to be obſerved, that the <hi>habeas corpus</hi> act of 31ſt of Charles the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, ſo juſtly conſidered as another Magna Charta of the kingdom<note n="*" place="bottom">Blackſtone, iv. 137.</note>, <q>extends only to the caſe of commitments for <g ref="char:startq">“</g>ſuch criminal charge as can produce no inconvenience to <g ref="char:endq">”</g>public juſtice by a temporary enlargement of the priſoner.</q> So careful were the legiſlature, at the very moment when they were providing for the liberty of the ſubject, not to furniſh any colour or pretence for violating or evading the eſtabliſhed law of bail in the higher criminal offences. But the exception, ſtated in the body of the act, puts the matter out of all doubt. After directing the judges how they are to proceed to the diſcharge of the priſoner upon recogniſance and ſurety, having regard to the quality of the priſoner, and nature of the offence, it is expreſsly added, <q>unleſs it ſhall <g ref="char:startq">“</g>appear to the ſaid Chancellor, &amp;c. that the party ſo commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is detained for ſuch matters or offences, for the which, <g ref="char:endq">”</g>BY THE LAW, THE PRISONER IS NOT BAILABLE.</q>

How an evaſive, indirect reply will ſtand with your reputation, or how far it will anſwer in point of defence, at the has of the Houſe of Lords, is worth your conſideration. If, after all that has been ſaid, it ſhould ſtill be maintained, that the court of King's bench, in bailing felons, are exempted from all le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal roles whatſoever; and that the judge has no direction to purſue but his private affections, or mere unqueſtionable a ill and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Was any thing offered by the Scotch triumvirate that tended to invalidate the poſitive charge made againſt him by four credible witneſſes upon oath?— Was it even inſinuated to you, either by himſelf, or hi bail, that no felony was committed;—or that <hi>he</hi> was not the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon; —that the ſtolen goods were <hi>not</hi> found upon him;—or that he was only the receiver, not knowing them to be ſtol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en? —Or, in ſhort, did they attempt to produce any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his inſanity?—To all theſe queſtions I anſwer for you, without the leaſt fear of contradiction, poſitively NO. From the moment he was arreſted, he never entertained any hope of acquittal; therefore though of nothing but obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bail, that he might have time to ſettle his affairs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey his fortune into another country, and ſpend the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of his life in comfort and affluence abroad. In this pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential ſcheme of future happineſs, the Lord Chief Juſtice of England moſt readily and heartily concurred. At ſight of ſo much virtue in diſtreſs, your natural benevolence took the alarm. Such a man as Mr. Eyre ſtruggling with adverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, muſt always be an intereſting ſcene to Lord Mansfield.— Or was it that liberal anxiety, by which your whole life has been diſtinguiſhed, to enlarge the liberty of the ſubject?—My Lord, we did not want this new inſtance of the liberality of your principles. We already knew what kind of ſubjects they were for whoſe liberty you were anxious. At all events, the public are much indebted to you for fixing a price at which felony may he committed with impunity. You bound a felon, notoriouſly worth 30,000 <abbr>l.</abbr> in the ſum of 300 <abbr>l.</abbr> With your natural turn to equity, and knowing as you are in the doctrine of precedents, you undoubtedly meant to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the proportion between the fortune of the felon and the fine: by which he may compound for his felony. The ratio now upon record, and tranſmitted to poſterity under the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpices of Lord Mansfield, is exactly one to an hundred.—My Lord, without intending it, you have laid a cruel reſtraint upon the genius of your country men. In the warmeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:023477_0281_0FBFB150A6846D88"/>of their paſſions, they have an eye to the expence; and if their other virthues fail us, we have a reſource in their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

It is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble indeed that be might have ſlattered himſelf, and not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably, with the hopes of a pardon. That he would have been pardoned, ſeems more than prodable, if I had not directed the public attention to the leading ſtep you took in favour of him. In the preſent gentle reign, we well know what uſe has been made of the lenity of the court and of the mercy of the crown. The Lord Chief Juſtice of England accepts of the hundredth part of the property of a felon tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in the fact, as a recogniſance for his appearance. Your brother <hi>Smyths</hi> browbeats a jury, and forces them to alter their verdict: by which they had found a Scotch ſerjeant guilty of murder; and though the Kennedies were convicted of a moſt deliberate and atrocious murder, they ſtill had a claim to the royal mercy.—They were ſaved by the chaſtity of their connections.—They had a ſiſter;—Yet it was not her beauty, but the pliancy of her virtue, that recommended her to the King.—The holy Author of our religion was ſeen in the company of ſinners; but it was his gracious purpoſe to convert them from their ſins. Another man, who in the ceremonies of our faith might give leſſons to the great enemy of it, open different principles keeps much the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. He advertiſes for patients, collects al the diſeaſes of the heart, and turns a royal palace into an hoſpital for incura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. —A man of honour has no ticket of admiſſion at St. James's.

When the conteſt turns upon the interpretation of the laws, you cannot, without a formal ſurrender of all your reputation, yield the poſt of honour even to Lord Chatham. Conſidering the ſituation and abilities of Lord Mansſield, I do not ſcruple to affirm, with the moſt ſolemn appeal to God for my ſincerity, that, in my judgment, he is the very worſt and moſt dangerous man in the kingdom. Thus far I have done my duty in endeavouring to bring him to puniſhment. But mine is an inſerior, miniſterial office in the temple of juſtice: I have hound the victim and dragged him to the altar.</p>

               <p>THE Reverend Mr. John Horne having, with his uſual veracity and honeſt induſtry, circulated a report that Junius, in a letter to the Supporters of the Bill of Rights, had warmly declared himſelf in favour of long Parliaments and rotten boroughs, it is thought neceſſary to ſubmit to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic the following extract from his letter to John Wilkes, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> dated the 7th of Septembe 1771, and laid before the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety on the 24th of the ſame month.</p>

Beſides my objection in point of form, I deſapprove high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the meaning of the fourth article as it ſtands, When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the queſtion ſhall be ſeriouſly agitated, I will enden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour (and if I live will aſſuredly attempt it) to convince the Engliſh nation, by arguments to <hi>my</hi> underſtanding unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable, that they ought to inſiſt upon a triennial, and baniſh the idea of an annual Parliament...... I am convinced, that, if ſhortening the duration of Parliaments (which in effect is keeping the repreſentative under the rod of the conſtituent) be not made the baſis of our new parliamentary juriſprudence, other checks or improvements figniſy nothing. On the contrary, if this be made the ſounadation, other meaſures may come in aid, and, as aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iliaries, be of conſiderable advantage. Lord Chatham's project, for inſtance, of increaſing the number of knights of ſhires, appears to me admirable........ As to cutting away the rotten boroughs, I am as much offended as any man at ſeeing ſo many of them under the direct in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the crown, or at the diſpoſal of private perſons. Yet, I own, I have both doubts and apprehenſions in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the remedy you propoſe. I ſhall be charged, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, with an unuſual want of political intrepidity, when honeſtly conſeſs to you, that I am ſtartled at the idea of ſo extenſive an amputation.—In the firſt place, I queſtion the power, <hi>de jure,</hi> of the legiſlature to disfranchiſe a a number of boroughs, upon the general ground of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the conſtitution. There cannot be a doctriue more ſatal to the liberty and property we are contending for, than that which conſounds the idea or <hi>cuprums</hi> and an <hi>arbitrary</hi> legiſlature. I need not point out to you the fatal porpoſes to which it has been, and may be, applied.
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:023477_0285_0FBFB164E8311BB8"/>If we are ſincere in the political creed we profeſs, there are many things which we ought to affirm cannot be one by King, Lords, and Commons, Among theſe I reckon the disfranchiſing of boroughs with a general view of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. I conſider it as equivalent to robbing the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties concerned, of their freehold, of their birthright. I ſay, that although this birthright may be forfeited. or the exerciſe of it ſuſpended in particular caſes, it cannot be taken away by a general law, for any real or pretended purpoſe of improving the conſtitution. Suppoſing the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt made, I am perſuaded you cannot mean that either King, or Lords, ſhould take an active part in it. A bill, which only touches the repreſentation of the people, muſt originate in the Houſe of Commons. In the formation and mode of paſſing it, the excluſive right of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons muſt be afferted as ſcrupulouſly as in the caſe of a money-bill. Now, Sir, I ſhould be glad to know by what kind of reaſoning it can be proved, that there is a power veſted in the repreſentative to deſtroy his immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent? Form whence could be poſſibly derive it? A courtier, I know, will be ready to maintain the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. The doctrine ſuits him exactly, becauſe it gives an unlimited operation to the inſluence of the crown. But we, Mr. Wilkes, ought to hold a different language. It is no anſwer to me to ſay, that the bill, when it paſſes the Houſe of Commons, is the act of the majority, and not the repreſentatives of the particular boroughs concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If the majority can disfranchiſe ten boroughs, why not twenty, why not the whole kingdom? Why ſhould not they make their own ſeats in Parliament for life?— When the ſeptennial act paſſed, the legiſlature did what, apparently and palpably, they had no power to do: but they did more than what people in general were aware of; they, in effect, disfranchiſed the whole kingdom for four <g ref="char:endq">”</g>years.</q>

To a man ſo capable of obſervation and reſlection as you are, it is unneceſſary to ſay all that might be ſaid upon the ſubject. Beſides that I approve highly of Lord Chatham's idea <hi>of infuſing a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of new health into the conſtitution, to enable it to bear is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,</hi> (a brilliant expreſſion, and full of intrinſic wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,) other reaſons concur in perſuading me to adopt it. <g ref="char:endq">”</g>I have no objection,</q> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The man who fairly and completely anſwers this argument ſhall have my thanks and my applauſe.

But neither ſhould I think the moſt exalted facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the human mind a gift worthy of he Divinity, nor any aſſiſtance in the improvement of them a ſubject of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to my fellow-creature, if I were not ſatisſied, that real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to inform the underſtanding corrects and enlarges the heart.</p>
