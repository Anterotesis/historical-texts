            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE WILL, &amp;c.</head>
            <head>IN THE NAME OF GOD, AMEN.</head>
            <p>I GEORGE WASHINGTON, of MOUNT VERNON, a CITIZEN of the <hi>United States,</hi> and lately <hi>Preſident</hi> of the ſame. DO make, ordain, and declare this Inſtrument, which is written with my own hand,<note n="*" place="bottom">In the original manuſcript, GEORGE WASHINGTON'S name was written at the bottom of every page.</note> and every page thereof ſubſcribed with my Name, to be my laſt WILL and TESTAMENT, revoking all others.—<hi>Imprimus.</hi> All my debts, of which there are but few, and none of magnitude, are to be punctually and ſpeedily paid, and the Legacies herein after bequeathed, are to be diſcharged as ſoon as circumſtances will permit, and in the manner directed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item.</hi>—To my dearly beloved Wife, <hi>Martha Waſhington,</hi> I give and bequeath the uſe, profit and benefit of my whole Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, real and perſonal, for the term of her natural life, except ſuch parts thereof as are ſpecially diſpoſed of hereafter.—My improved Lot, in the town of Alexandria, ſituated on Pitt and Cameron ſtreets, I give to her and her heirs forever; as I alſo do my Houſehold and Kitchen Furniture, of every ſort and kind, with the Liquors and Groceries which may be on hand at the time of my deceaſe, to be uſed and diſpoſed of as ſhe may think proper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item.</hi>—Upon the deceaſe of my wife, it is my will and deſire that all the Slaves which I hold in my <hi>own right</hi> ſhall receive their freedom. To emancipate them during her life, would, though earneſtly wiſhed by me, be attended with ſuch inſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble difficulties, on account of their intermixture by marriages with the dower Negroes, as to excite the moſt painful ſenſations, if not diſagreeable conſequences from the latter, while both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions are in the occupancy of the ſame proprietor; it not being in my power, under the tenure by which the dower Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:038994_0003_10128B3CC1F51D28"/>
are held, to manumit them. <hi>And whereas,</hi> among thoſe who will receive freedom according to this deviſe, there may be ſome, who from old age or bodily infirmities, and others, who on account of their infancy, that will be unable to ſupport them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, it is my will and deſire, that all who come under the firſt and ſecond deſcription, ſhall be comfortably clothed and fed by my heirs while they live; and that ſuch of the latter deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as have no parents living, or if living, are unable or unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to provide for them, ſhall be bound by the court until they ſhall arrive at the age of twenty five years; and in caſes where no record can be produced, whereby their ages can be aſcertained, the judgment of the court, upon its own view of the ſubject, ſhall be adequate and final. The Negroes thus bound, are (by their maſters or miſtreſſes) to be taught to read and write, and to be brought up to ſome uſeful occupation, agreeably to the laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, providing for the ſupport of orphan and other poor children. And I do hereby expreſsly forbid the ſale or tranſportation, out of the ſaid Commonwealth, of any Slave, I may die poſſeſſed of, under any pretence whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. And I do moreover, moſt pointedly and moſt ſolemnly enjoin it upon my Executors hereafter named, or the ſurvivor of them, to ſee that <hi>this</hi> clauſe reſpecting Slaves, and every part thereof, be religiouſly fulfilled at the epoch at which it is directed to take place, without evaſion, neglect or delay, after the crops which may then be on the ground are harveſted, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly as it reſpects the aged and infirm; ſeeing that a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and permanent fund be eſtabliſhed for their ſupport, as long as there are ſubjects requiring it; not truſting to the uncertain proviſion to be made by individuals: And to my mulatto man, <hi>William,</hi> (calling himſelf William Lee) I give immediate freedom, or if he ſhould prefer it (on account of the accidents which have befallen him, and which have rendered him incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of walking, or of any active employment) to remain in the ſituation he now is, it ſhall be optional in him to do ſo; in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe, however, I allow him an annuity of Thirty Dollars during his natural life, which ſhall be independent of the vict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uals and clothes he has been accuſtomed to receive, if he chooſes the laſt alternative; but in full with his freedom, if he prefers the firſt; and this I give him, as a teſtimony of my ſenſe of his attachment to me, and for his faithful ſervices during the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutionary War.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item.</hi>—To the Truſtees (Governors, or by whatſoever other name they may be deſignated) of the Academy, in the town of Alexandria, I give and bequeath, in truſt, Four Thouſand Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:038994_0004_10128B40AC043810"/>
or in other words, twenty of the Shares which I hold in the Bank of Alexandria, towards the ſupport of a Free School, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed at, and annexed to, the ſaid Academy, for the purpoſe of educating ſuch Orphan Children, or the Children of ſuch other poor and indigent perſons, as are unable to accompliſh it with their own means; and who, in the judgment of the Truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees of the ſaid Seminary, are beſt entitled to the benefit of this donation. The aforeſaid 20 Shares I give and bequeath in perpetuity; the dividends only of which are to be drawn for, and applied by the ſaid Truſtees, for the time being, for the uſes abovementioned; the Stock to remain entire and untouched, unleſs indications of failure of ſaid Bank ſhould be ſo apparent, or a diſcontinuance thereof, ſhould render a removal of this fund neceſſary. In either of theſe caſes, the amount of the Stock here deviſed is to be veſted in ſome other bank, or public inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, whereby the intereſt may with regularity and certainty be drawn and applied as above: And, to prevent miſconception, my meaning is, and is hereby declared to be, that theſe Twenty Shares are in lieu of, and not in addition to, the Thouſand Pounds given by a miſſive letter ſome years ago; in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence whereof, an annuity of Fifty Pounds has ſince been paid towards the ſupport of this inſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item.</hi>—WHEREAS by a law of the Commonwealth of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, enacted in the year 1785, the Legiſlature thereof, was pleaſed, as an evidence of its approbation of the ſervices I had rendered the public, during the Revolution, and partly I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, in conſideration of my having ſuggeſted the vaſt advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which the community would derive from the extenſion of its inland navigation under Legiſlative patronage, to preſent me with One hundred ſhares, of One Hundred Dollars each, in the incorporated Company, eſtabliſhed for the purpoſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the navigation of James' River, from tide water to the mountains;—and alſo with Fifty ſhares of £100 ſterling each, in the corporation of another company likewiſe eſtabliſhed for the ſimilar purpoſe of opening the navigation of the river Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towmack, from the tide water to Fort Cumberland; the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of which, although the offer was highly honorable and grateful to my feelings, was refuſed, as inconſiſtent with a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which I had adopted, and had never departed from—viz. not to receive pecuniary compenſation for any ſervices I could render my country in its arduous ſtruggle with Greatbritain for its rights; and becauſe I had evaded ſimilar propoſitions from other States in the Union. Adding to this refuſal, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, an intimation that, if it ſhould be the pleaſure of the leg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſlature,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038994_0005_10128B44E68AA748"/>
to permit me to appropriate the ſaid ſhares to <hi>public uſes,</hi> I would receive them on thoſe terms with due ſenſibility; and this it having conſented to, in flattering terms, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by a ſubſequent law, and ſundry reſolutions, in the moſt ample and honorable manner, I proceed after this recital, for the more correct underſtanding of the caſe, to declare—That as it has always been a ſource of ſerious regret with me, to ſee the youth of theſe United States ſent to foreign countries for the purpoſe of Education, often before their minds were formed, or they had imbibed any adequate ideas of the happineſs of their own; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting too frequently, not only habits of diſſipation and extrav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agance, but principles unfriendly to Republican Government, and to the true and genuine liberties of mankind; which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after are rarely overcome.—For theſe reaſons it has been my ardent wiſh, to ſee a plan deviſed on a liberal ſcale, which would have a tendency to ſpread ſyſtematic ideas through all parts of this riſing empire, thereby to do away local attachments and State prejudices, as far as the nature of things would, or indeed ought to admit, from our National Councils.—Looking anxiouſly forward to the accompliſhment of ſo deſirable an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject as this is, (in my eſtimation) my mind has not been able to contemplate any plan more likely to effect the meaſure than the eſtabliſhment of an UNIVERSITY in a central part of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States, to which the Youths of fortune and talents from all parts thereof, may be ſent for the completion of their educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in all the branches of polite literature; in arts and ſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in acquiring knowledge in the principles of politics and good government, and, (as a matter of infinite importance in my judgment) by aſſociating with each other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and forming friendſhips in juvenile years, be enabled to free themſelves, in a proper degree, from thoſe local prejudices and habitual jealouſies which have juſt been mentioned; and which, when carried to exceſs, are never ſailing ſources of diſquietude to the public mind and pregnant of miſchievous conſequences to this country, under theſe impreſſions, ſo fully dilated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item.</hi>—I give and bequeath in perpetuity, the Fifty ſhares which I hold in the Potowmack company (under the aforeſaid acts of the Legiſlature of Virginia) towards the endowment of an U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIVERSITY<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be eſtabliſhed within the limits of the diſtrict of Columbia, under the auſpices of the General Government, if that government ſhould incline to extend a foſtering hand towards it; and until ſuch Seminary is eſtabliſhed, and the funds ariſing on theſe ſhares ſhall be required for its ſupport, my further WILL and deſire is that the profit accruing therefrom, ſhall, whenever
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:038994_0006_10128B4923F790B8"/>
the dividends are made, be laid out in purchaſing Stock in the Bank of Columbia, or ſome other Bank, at the diſcretion of my Excutors, or by the Treaſurer of the United States for the time being, under the direction of Congreſs—provided that Honorable body ſhould patronize the meaſure; and the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dends proceeding from the purchaſe of ſuch Stock, is to be veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in more Stock, and ſo on, until a ſum, adequate to the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of the object is obtained; of which I have not the ſmalleſt doubt before many years paſs away, even if no aid or encouragement is given by the Legiſlative authority, or from any other ſource.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item.</hi>—The Hundred Shares which I hold in the James River Company, I have given, and now confirm in perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, to and for the uſe and benefit of Liberty Hall Academy, in the Country of Rockbridge, in the Commonwealth of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Item.</hi>—I releaſe, exonerate, and diſcharge the Eſtate of my deceaſed Brother <hi>Samuel Waſhington,</hi> from the payment of the money which is due to me for the land I ſold to <hi>Philip Pendleton</hi> (lying in the County of Berkley) who aſſigned the ſame to him, the ſaid <hi>Samuel,</hi> who by agreement, was to pay me therefor: <hi>And whereas,</hi> by ſome contract, (the purport of which was never communicated to me, between the ſaid <hi>Samuel</hi> and his ſon, <hi>Thornton Waſhington,</hi> the latter became poſſeſſed of the aforeſaid Land, without any conveyance having paſſed from me, either to the ſaid <hi>Pendleton,</hi> the ſaid <hi>Samuel,</hi> or the ſaid <hi>Thornton,</hi> and without any conſideration having been made, by which neglect neither the legal nor equitable title has been alienated; it reſts therefore with me to declare my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning the premiſes; and theſe are to give and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath the ſaid land to whomſoever the ſaid <hi>Thornton Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington</hi> (who is alſo dead) deviſed the ſame, or to his heirs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if he died inteſtate, exonerating the eſtate of the ſaid <hi>Thornton,</hi> equally with that of the ſaid <hi>Samuel,</hi> from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the purchaſe money, which, with intereſt, agreeably to the original contract with the ſaid <hi>Pendleton,</hi> would amount to more than a Thouſand Pounds; <hi>And whereas,</hi> two other ſons of my ſaid deceaſed Brother <hi>Samuel,</hi> namely <hi>George Steptoe Waſhington,</hi> and <hi>Lawrence Auguſtine Waſhington,</hi> were, by the deceaſe of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſe to whoſe care they were committed, brought under my protection, and in conſequence, have occaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioned advances on my part, for their education at College, and other ſchools, for their board, clothing, and other incidental expenſes, to the amount of near Five Thouſand Dollars, over
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038994_0007_10128B4ABA1241B8"/>

               <hi>Item.</hi>—The balance due to me from the eſtate of <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew Dandridge,</hi> deceaſed, (my Wife's Brother) and which amounted on the firſt day of October, 1795, to four hundred and twentyfive pounds, (as will appear by an account ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by his deceaſed ſon <hi>John Dandridge,</hi> who was the act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing executor of his father's will) I releaſe and acquit from the payment thereof—and the Negroes (then thirtythree in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber formerly belonging to the ſaid eſtate, who were taken in execution, ſold and purchaſed in on my account, in the year <hi>(blank)</hi> and ever ſince have remained in the poſſeſſion, and to the uſe of <hi>Mary,</hi> widow of the ſaid <hi>Bartholomew Dandridge,</hi> with their increaſe, it is my WILL and DESIRE ſhall continue and be in her poſſeſſion, without paying hire, or making com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for the ſame, for the time paſt or to come, during her natural life; at the expiration of which, I direct that all of them who are forty years old and upwards, ſhall receive their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and all under that age and above ſixteen, ſhall ſerve ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en years and no longer; and all under ſixteen years ſhall ſerve until they are twentyfive years of age, and then be free—and to avoid diſputes reſpecting the ages of any of theſe Negroes, they are to be taken into the court of the County in which they reſide, and the judgment thereof, in this relation, ſhall be final, and record thereof made, which may be adduced as evidence at any time thereafter, if diſputes ſhould ariſe concerning the ſame—And I further direct that the heirs of the ſaid <hi>Bartholomew Dandridge</hi> ſhall, equally ſhare the benefits ariſing from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the ſaid negroes, according to the tenor of this deviſe, upon the deceaſe of their mother.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Item.</hi>—To my Nephew, <hi>Buſhrod Waſhington,</hi> I give and bequeath all the Papers in my poſſeſſion, which relate to my civil and military adminiſtration, of the affairs of this country—I leave to him alſo, ſuch of my private Papers as are worth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving; and at the deceaſe of my Wife, and before, if ſhe is not inclined to retain them, I give and bequeath my Library of Books and Pamphlets of every kind.</p>

               <hi>Item.</hi>—To the <hi>Earl of Buchan</hi> I recommit the "Box made of the Oak, that ſheltered the great Sir <hi>William Wallace,</hi> after the battle of Falkirk" preſented to me by his Lordſhip in terms too flattering for me to repeat, with a requeſt "to paſs it, on the event of my deceaſe, to the man in my country, who ſhould appear to merit it beſt, upon the ſame conditions that have induced him to ſend it to me." Whether eaſy or not to ſelect the <hi>Man</hi> who might comport with his Lordſhip's opinion in this reſpect, is not for me to ſay; but conceiving that no diſpoſition of this valuable curioſity can be more eligible than the recommitment of it to his own cabinet, agreeably to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal

            <p>
               <hi>Item.</hi>—To my Brother <hi>Charles Waſhington,</hi> I give and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queath the gold headed Cane, left me by Dr. <hi>Franklin</hi> in his will. I add nothing to it, becauſe of the ample proviſion I have made for his iſſue. To the acquaintances and friends of any juvenile years, <hi>Lawrence Waſhington</hi> and <hi>Robert Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington,</hi> of Chotanck, I give my other two gold headed Canes, having my arms engraved on them; and to each, as they will be uſeful where they live, I leave one of the Spyglaſſes, which conſtituted part of my equipage during the late war. To my Compatriot in arms and old and intimate Friend, Dr. <hi>Craik,</hi> I give my Bureau (or, as the cabinet makers call it, Tambour Secretary) and the circular Chair, an appendage of my ſtudy. To Dr. <hi>David Stuart</hi> I give my large Shaving and Dreſſing Table, and my Teleſcope.

Theſe bequeſts are not made for the intrinſic value of them, but as mementos of my eſteem and regard. To <hi>Tobias Lear,</hi> I give the uſe of the Farm which he now holds, in virtue of a leaſe from me to him and his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed wife (for and during their natural lives) free from rent during his life; at the expiration of which, it is to be diſpoſed of as is herein after directed. To <hi>Sally B. Haynie,</hi> (a diſtant relation of mine) I give and bequeath three hundred dollars. To <hi>Sarah Green,</hi> daughter of the deceaſed <hi>Thomas Biſhop,</hi> and to <hi>Ann Walker,</hi> daughter of <hi>John Alton,</hi> alſo deceaſed, I give each one hundred dollars in conſideration of the attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their fathers to me; each of whom having lived near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forty years in my family. To each of my Nephews, <hi>William Auguſtine Waſhington, George Lewis, George Steptoe Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, Buſhrod Waſhington</hi> and <hi>Samuel Waſhington,</hi> I
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038994_0010_10128B565269FD40"/>
give one of the Swords, or Cutteaux, of which I may die poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and they are to chooſe in the order they are named.—Theſe ſwords are accompanied with an injunction not to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheath them for the purpoſe of ſhedding blood, except it be for ſelf defence, or in defence of their country and its rights; and in the latter caſe, to keep them unſheathed, and prefer falling with them in their hands to the relinquiſhment thereof.</p>
            <p>AND NOW, having gone through theſe ſpecific Deviſes, with explanations for the more correct underſtanding of the meaning and deſign of them, I proceed to the diſtribution of the more important parts of my Eſtate, in manner follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi>—To my Nephew, <hi>Buſhrod Waſhington,</hi> and his Heirs, (partly in conſideration of an intimation to his deceaſed Father, while we were Bachelors, and he had kindly undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to ſuperintend my Eſtate during my military ſervices, in the former war between Greatbritain and France that if I ſhould fall therein, Mount Vernon, (then leſs extenſive in domain than at preſent) ſhould become his property, I give and bequeath all that part thereof, which is comprehended within the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing limits, viz.—BEGINNING at the ford of Dogue Run, near my Mill, and extending along the road, and bounded thereby, as it now goes, and ever has gone, ſince my recollection of it, to the ford of Little Hunting Creek, at the Gum Spring, until it comes to a knowl, oppoſite to an old road which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſed through the lower field of Muddy Hole Farm; at which, on the north ſide of the ſaid road, are three Red or Spaniſh Oaks, marked as a corner, and a ſtone placed—thence by a line of trees, to be marked rectangular, to the back line or outer boundary of the tract between <hi>Thomſon Maſon</hi> and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf—thence with that line eaſterly (now double ditching, with a poſt and rail Fence thereon) to the run of Little Hunting Creek—thence with that run, which is the boundary between the lands of the late <hi>Humphry Peake,</hi> and me, to the tide water of the ſaid Creek—thence by that water to Potowmack river—thence with the river to the mouth of Dogue Creek—and thence with the ſaid Dogue Creek to the place of beginning at the aforeſaid ford, containing upwards of four thouſand acres be the ſame more or leſs, together with the Manſion Houſe, and all other buildings and improvements thereon. SECOND—Inconſideration of the conſanguinity between them and my Wife, being as nearly related to her as to myſelf: as, on account of the affection I had for, and the obligation I was under to, their Father

In the mean time, if the termination of my Wife's intereſt therein ſhould have ceaſed, the profits ariſing therefrom are to be applied for their joint uſes and benefit. THIRD—<hi>And whereas</hi> it has always been my intention, ſince my expectation of having iſſue has ceaſed, to conſider the grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>children of my Wife in the ſame light as I do my own relations, and to act a friendly part by them, more eſpecially by the two whom we have raiſed from their earlieſt infancy, namely, <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Park Cuſtis,</hi> and <hi>George Waſhington Park Cuſtis,</hi> and whereas the former of theſe hath lately intermarried with <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Lewis,</hi> a ſon of my deceaſed ſiſter, <hi>Betty Lewis,</hi> by which union the inducement to provide for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

together with the mill, diſtillery, and all other houſes and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements on the premiſes, making together about two thouſand acres, be it more or leſs. FOURTH—Actuated by the principle already mentioned, I give and bequeath to <hi>George Waſhington Park Cuſtis,</hi> the grandſon of my Wife, and my ward, and to his heirs, the tract I hold on Four Mile Run, in the vicinity of Alexandria, containing one thouſand two hundred acres, more or leſs, and my entire ſquare, No. 21, in the city of Waſhington. FIFTH—All the reſt and reſidue of my eſtate, real and perſonal, not diſpoſed of in manner aforeſaid, in whatſoever conſiſting, whereſoever lying, and whenſoever found, a ſchedule of which, as far as is recollected, with a reaſonable eſtimate of its value, is hereunto annexed, I deſire may be ſold by my Executors, at ſuch times, in ſuch manner, and on ſuch credits, (if an equal, valid and ſatisfactory diſtribution of the ſpecific property cannot be made without) as in their judgment ſhall be moſt conducive to the intereſt of the parties concerned; and the monies ariſing therefrom to be divided into twentythree equal parts, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied as follow, viz. To <hi>William Auguſtine Waſhington, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizabeth Spotſwood, Jane Thornton,</hi> and the heirs of <hi>Ann Aſhton,</hi> ſons and daughters of my deceaſed Brother, <hi>Auguſtine Waſhington,</hi> I give and bequeath four parts; that is, one part to each of them. To <hi>Fielding Lewis, George Lewis, Robert Lewis, Howell Lewis</hi> and <hi>Betty Carter,</hi> ſons and daughters of my deceaſed ſiſter, <hi>Betty Lewis,</hi> I give and bequeath five other parts; one to each of them. To <hi>George Steptoe Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, Lawrence Auguſtine Waſhington, Harriott Parks,</hi> and the heirs of <hi>Thornton Waſhington,</hi> ſons and daughters of my deceaſed brother, <hi>Samuel Waſhington,</hi> I give and beqeath other four parts; one to each of them. To <hi>Corbin Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and the heirs of <hi>Jane Waſhington,</hi> ſon and daughter of my deceaſed Brother, <hi>John Auguſtine Waſhington,</hi> I give and bequeath two parts; one to each of them. To <hi>Samuel Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, Frances Ball</hi> and <hi>Mildred Hammond,</hi> ſon and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of my Brother, <hi>Charles Waſhington,</hi> I give and bequeath three parts: one part to each of them: And to <hi>George Fayette Waſhington,</hi> Charles Auguſtine Waſhington, and <hi>Maria Waſhington,</hi> ſons and daughters of my deceaſed Nephew, <hi>George Auguſtine Waſhington,</hi> I give one other part; that is, to each a third of that part. To <hi>Elizabeth Park Law, Martha Park Peters,</hi> and <hi>Eleanor Park Lewis,</hi> I give and bequeath three other parts, that is, a part to each of them. And to my Nephew, <hi>Buſhrod Waſhington</hi> and <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Lewis,</hi> and to my ward, the grandſon of my Wife.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038994_0013_10128B5F0342D6C0"/>
I give and bequeath one other part, that is, a third thereof to each of them. And if it ſhould ſo happen, that any of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whoſe names are here enumerated (unknown to me) ſhould now be dead, or ſhould die before me, that in either of theſe caſes, the heirs of ſuch deceaſed perſon ſhall, notwithſtanding, derive all the benefits of the bequeſt in the ſame manner, as if he or ſhe was actually living at the time. And by way of advice, I recommend it to my Executors not to be precipitate of diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the landed property (herein directed to be ſold) if from temporary cauſes, the ſale thereof ſhould be dull; experience having fully evinced, that the price of land, (eſpecially above the falls of the river, and on the weſtern waters) have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſively riſing, and cannot be long checked in its increaſing value. And I particularly recommend it to ſuch of the Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees (under this clauſe of my will) as can make it convenient, to take each a ſhare of my ſtock in the Potowmack Company, in preference to the amount of what it might ſell for; being tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly convinced myſelf, that no uſes to which the money can be applied, will be ſo productive as the tolls ariſing from this nav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igation when in full operation, (and thus, from the nature of things, it muſt be, ere long) and more eſpecially if that of the Shenandoah is added thereto.</p>
            <p>The family vault at Mount Vernon requiring repairs, and being improperly ſituated beſides, I deſire, that a new one of brick, and upon a larger ſcale, may be built at the foot of what is commonly called the Vineyard Incloſure, on the ground which is marked out: In which my remains, with thoſe of my deceaſed relations, (now in the old vault) and ſuch others of my family as may chooſe to be entombed there, may be depoſited. And it is my expreſs deſire, that my corpſe may be interred in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate manner, without parade, or funeral oration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> I conſtitute and appoint my dearly beloved Wife, <hi>Martha Waſhington,</hi> my Nephew, <hi>William Auguſtine Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, Buſhrod Waſhington, George Steptoe Waſhington, Samuel Waſhington,</hi> and <hi>Lawrence Lewis,</hi> and my ward, <hi>George Waſhington Park Cuſtis,</hi> (when he ſhall have arrived at the age of twentyone years) Executrix and Executors of this Will and Teſtament: In the conſtruction of which it will be readily perceived that no profeſſional character has been conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or has had any agency in the draught; and that although it has occupied many of my leaſure hours to digeſt, and to throw it into its preſent form, it may, notwithſtanding, appear crude and incorrect; but, having endeavored to be plain and explicit in all the deviſes, even at the expenſe of prolixity, perhaps of tautolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,

            <head>NOTES.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>(a)</hi> THIS tract, for the ſize of it, is valuable, more for its ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation than the quality of its ſoil; though that is good for farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, with a conſiderable proportion of ground that might very eaſily be improved into meadow. It lies on the great road from the city of Waſhington, Alexandria and Georgetown, to Leeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh and Wincheſter. At Difficult Bridge, nineteen miles from Alexandria, leſs from the city of Georgetown, and not more than three from Matildaville, at the Great Falls of Potow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack there is a valuable ſeat on the premiſes, and the whole is conditionally ſold for the ſum annexed in the ſchedule.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(b)</hi> What the ſelling prices of lands, in the vicinity of theſe two tracts, are, I know not; but<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> compared with thoſe above the ridge and others below them, he value annexed will appear moderate; a leſs one would not obtain them from me.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(c)</hi> The ſurrounding land, not ſuperior in ſoil. ſituation or properties of any ſort, ſell currently at from twenty to thirty dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars an acre. The loweſt price is affixed to theſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(d)</hi> The obſervations, made in the laſt note, apply equally to this <hi>tract;</hi> being in the vicinity of them, and of ſimilar quality, although it lies in another country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(e)</hi> This tract, though ſmall, is extremely valuable. It has on Potowmack River, about 12 miles above the town of Bath or Warm Springs, and is in the ſhape of a horſeſhoe; the river run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning almoſt around it. Two hundred acres of it is rich low grounds, with a great abundance of the largeſt and fineſt walnut trees; which with the produce of the ſoil might, (by means of the improved navigation of the Potowmack) be brought to a ſhipping port, with more eaſe, and at a ſmaller expenſe, than that which is tranſported 30 miles only, by land:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(f)</hi> This tract is of ſecond rate Glouceſter low ground; it has no improvements thereon, but lies on navigable water, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in fiſh and oyſters. It was received in payment of a debt, (carrying intereſt) and valued in the year 1789, by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial gentleman, to £800. N. B. It has lately been ſold and there is due there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n a balance, equal to what is annexed in the ſchedule.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(g)</hi> Theſe 373 acres are the third part of undivided purchaſe made by the deceaſed Fielding Lewis, Thomas Walker and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; on full conviction that they would become valuable. The Lord lies on the road from Suffolk and Norfolk, touches, (if I am not miſtaken) ſome part of the navigable water of Nanſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond river; the Rich Diſmal Swamp is capable of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement; and from its ſituation muſt become extremely val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(h)</hi> This is an undivided intereſt, which I held in the Great Diſmal Swamp company, containing about 4000 acres, with my part of the plantation and ſtock thereon, belonging to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in the ſaid Swamp.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(i)</hi> Theſe ſeveral tracts of land are of the firſt quality on
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:038994_0019_10128B713B535120"/>
the Ohio river, in the parts where they are ſituated; being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, if not altogether, river bottoms. The ſmalleſt of theſe tracts is actually ſold at ten dollars an acre, but the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefor not received. The reſt are equally valuable, and ſold as high; eſpecially that which lies juſt below the Little Kenhawa, and is oppoſite to a thick ſettlement on the weſt ſide of the river. The four tracts have an aggregate breadth upon, the river of ſixteen miles, and is bounded thereby that diſtance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(k)</hi> Theſe tracts are ſituated on the Great Kenhawa river, and the firſt four are bounded thereby for more than forty miles. It is acknowledged by all who have ſeen them, (and of the tract containing 10990 acres, which I have been on myſelf, I can aſſert) that there is no richer or more valuable land in all that region; they are conditionally ſold for the ſum mentioned in the ſchedule, that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 200,000 dollars; and if the terms of that ſale are not complied with, they will command conſiderably more. The tract, of which the 125 acres is a moiety, was taken up by General Andrew Lewis and myſelf, for, and on account of a bituminous ſpring which it contains, of ſo inflammable a nature as to burn as freely as ſpirits, and is as nearly difficult to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(l)</hi> I am but little acquainted with this land, although I have once been on it. It was received, (many years ſince) in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of a debt to me from Daniel Janifer Adams at the value annexed thereto, and muſt be worth more. It is very level; lies near the river Potowmack.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(m)</hi> This tract lies about 30 miles above the city of Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, not far from Kittoctan. It is good farming land and by thoſe who are well acquainted with it, I am informed that it would ſell at twelve or fifteen dollars per acre.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(n)</hi> This land is valuable on account of its local ſituation, and other properties. It affords an exceeding good ſtand on Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock's road, from Fort Cumberland to Pittſburgh, and beſides a fertile ſoil poſſeſſes a large quantity of natural meadow, fit for the ſcythe. It is diſtinguiſhed by the appellation of the Great Meadows, where the firſt action with the French in 1754 was fought.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(o)</hi> This is the moiety of about 2000 acres, which remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſold of 6071 acres on the Mohawk river, (Montgomery county) in a patent granted to <hi>Daniel Coxe,</hi> in the townſhip of Coxebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough and Carolinas, as will appear by deed from <hi>Marinas Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> and wife, to <hi>George Clinton,</hi> (late Governor of Newyork) and myſelf. The latter ſales have been at ſix dollars an acre, and what remains unſold, will fetch that or more</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(p)</hi> The quality of theſe lands and their ſituations, may be known by the ſurveyors' certificates, which are filed along with the patents. They lie in the vicinity of Cincinnati; one tract near the mouth of the Little Miami; another ſeven, and the third ten miles up the ſame. I have been informed that they will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand more than they are eſtimated at.</p>
            <p>

Beſides the general good quality of the land, there is a valuable bank of Iron Ore thereon, which when the ſettlement becomes more populous, (and ſettlers are moving that way very faſt) will be found very valuable; as the Rough Creek, a branch of Green River, affords ample water for furnaces and forges.</p>
            <p>LOTS, viz. CITY OF WASHINGTON.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(r)</hi> The two lots near the Capital in ſquare 634, coſt me 963 dollars only. But in this price I was favored, on condition that I ſhould build two brick houſes, three ſtories high each; without this reduction, the ſelling prices of thoſe lots would have coſt me about 1350 dollars. Theſe lots, with the buildings thereon, when completed, will ſtand me in 15,000 dollars at leaſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(s)</hi> Lots No. 5, 12, 13 and 14, on the Eaſtern branch, are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly ſituated on the water, and although many lots, much leſs convenient, have ſold a great deal higher, I will rate theſe at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>2 cents the ſquare foot only.</p>
            <p>ALEXANDRIA.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(t)</hi> For this lot, though unimproved, I have refuſed 3500 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. It has ſince been laid out into proper ſized lots for build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on; three or four of which are let on ground rent forever, at three dollars a foot on the ſtreet, and this price is aſked for both fronts on Pitt and Princeſs ſtreet.</p>
            <p>WINCHESTER.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(u)</hi> As neither the lot in the town or common have any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements on them, it is not eaſy to fix a price; but as both are well ſituated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is preſumed that the price annexed to them in the ſchedule is a reaſonable valuation.</p>
            <p>BATH.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(v)</hi> The lots in Bath, (two adjoining) coſt me, to the beſt of my recollection, between fifty and ſixty pounds, 20 years ago; and the buildings thereon, 150<hi>l.</hi> more. Whether property there has increaſed or decreaſed in its value, and in what condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the houſes are, I am ignorant; but ſuppoſe they are not valued too high.</p>
            <p>STOCK.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(w)</hi> Theſe are the ſums which are actually funded; and though no more in the aggregate than 7566 dollars, ſtand me in at leaſt ten thouſand pounds, Virginia money, being the amount of bonded and other debts, due to me, and diſcharged during the war, when money had depreciated in that rate, ☞and was ſo ſettled by public authority.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(x)</hi> The value annexed to theſe ſhares is what they have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually coſt me, and is the price affixed by law; and although the preſent ſelling price is under par, my advice to the Legatees. (for whoſe benefit they are intended, eſpecially thoſe who can afford
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:038994_0021_10128B75B81C22C0"/>
to lie out of the money) is, that each ſhould take and hold one; there being a moral certainty of a great and increaſing profit, ariſing from them in the courſe of a few years.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>(y)</hi> It is ſuppoſed that the ſhares in the James River Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany muſt be productive. But of this I can give no decided o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, for want of more accurate information.</p>

               <hi>(z)</hi> Theſe are the nominal prices of the Shares in the banks of Alexandria and Columbia; the ſelling prices vary according to circumſtances; but as the ſtock uſually divide from eight to ten per cent per annum, they muſt be worth the former, at leaſt, ſo long as the banks are conceived to be ſecure, although from circumſtances, they may ſometimes be below it.</p>
            <p>The value of the live ſtock depends more upon the quality than quantity of the different ſpecies of it, and this again upon the demand and judgment, or fancy of purchaſers.</p>
