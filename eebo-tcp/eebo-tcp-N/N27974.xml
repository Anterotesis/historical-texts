            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>MY principal deſign in the preſent publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, is to eſtabliſh the truth reſpecting the origin of the yellow fever in this country; and, to communicate what appears to me to be an improvement, in the treatment of that dangerous malady.</p>
            <p>The intelligent reader will perceive, that the preſent performance contains ſome ſentiments in ſome reſpects different from thoſe I former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertained, and particularly with reſpect to the identity of the yellow fever with that of the typhus gravior or common malignant fever of camps and hoſpitals: I therefore beg leave to remind him, that knowledge muſt neceſſarily be progreſſive on new and intricate ſubjects; and that ſince my former publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, additional obſervations and more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and accurate views, have afforded me more correct ideas on the ſubject.</p>

               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:037274_0003_100CA4D36D8AC488"/>
It is my ſincere wiſh that all ambiguity ſhould be removed, and the truth eſtabliſhed independent of every other conſideration: if therefore any material miſtakes ſhould be diſcovered in the following pages, I ſhall eſteem the correction of them as an act of friendſhip; for I conſider the ſituation of a man to be ſingularly unfortunate, who, while he is ſeeking to enlighten others, is walking in the dark himſelf.</p>
            <p>With thoſe ſentiments, and this diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the preſent production is dedicated to the candid and intelligent part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,</p>

            <head>A SKETCH, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE firſt caſes of the peſtilential or yellow fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver that occurred laſt year in Philadelphia, were in the neighbourhood of Meſſrs. Willing and Francis's wharf, between Pine and Lombard-ſtreets, near the ſouthern boundary of the city: and in ſouthwark, in the neighbourhood of the ſtill-houſe wharf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few paces of the Swedes church.</p>
            <p>The firſt caſes that have come to my knowledge in the neighbourhood of the firſt mentioned wharf, were the following, <abbr>viz.</abbr> A young woman at No. 17, about the 15th or 16th of June; Mr. Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mead, a little lower down in Front-ſtreet, on the 17th, who died on the 23d. Mr. Thomas, who had been on board a veſſel from Curracoa, and came from the quarantine ground the 15th, was taken ill with the fever on the 17th. A ſhoemaker's boy, on the 21ſt, was moved from Southwark to Arch near Seventh-ſtreet and there died. Mr. John
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037274_0005_100CA4D8EF889440"/>
M'Donald, who lodged near Meſſrs. Willing and Francis's wharf, at No. 17, Penn-ſtreet, directly back of the wharf, was attacked on the 24th and died on the 29th. The mate of a ſnow from Hamburgh, at that time lying at the ſame wharf, was alſo taken with the fever on the 24th and died on the 29th.</p>
            <p>The next caſes in the order of time that occurred in the neighbourhood of that wharf, were, a young woman at Mr. Samuel Rhoads's, on the 25th, who died on the 30th: Mr. Smith, who had been on board of two veſſels at the wharf, on the 27th: Captain Roſs's daughter on the 28th, and his wife about the firſt of July: Mr. Thomas Cuthbert on the 27th or 28th of June. Mr. James Smith's ſon, in Lombard-ſtreet, who had been on the wharf marking caſks belonging to the Hamburgh ſnow, was attacked on the 28th of June. Several other caſes occurred in the ſame neighbourhood a few days later; and from thoſe the diſeaſe gradually ſpread into different parts of the city.</p>
            <p>A ſmall ſloop called the Molly, prize to the Ganges, had lain at the wharf near the place where the firſt caſes of the fever commenced, from the 13th of May. Her cargo, conſiſting chiefly of coffee, was landed and ſtored near the wharf early in June: her hatches were kept ſhut till the 21ſt of June, at which time they were opened on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037274_0006_100CA4DA77A13218"/>
of the ſtench proceeding from her, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the account of Samuel Fiſher, who had the care of her, 500 buckets of water were thrown into her to clean and ſweeten her. The bedding of ſome of the ſeamen that came in her, were left on board: the prize maſter and ſeamen that brought her in had left her. She was employed trading from Turk's iſland to St. Domingo, at the time of her capture. No perſons were then ſick on board, nor did any one become ſick while navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating her into port. The prize maſter became ſick ſoon after her arrival, but I have not learned what became of him.</p>
            <p>Near this ſloop lay a ſnow from Hamburgh, the mate and cook, and one of the ſeamen of which ſickened ſoon after the hatches of the Molly were opened, and two of them died with malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſymptoms, the other recovered. Mr. Smith's ſon was near the ſloop marking caſks leſs than a week before his attack: he recovered. During the time the ſloop lay at Meſſrs. Willing and Francis's wharf, the ſhip Amiable-Creole, from Havanna, arrived at the city, and came to at the wharf next to Willing and Francis's, called Nixon's wharf. Reſpecting this laſt veſſel I have been able to obtain no ſatisfactory information. Mr. Hollingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth's lighters alſo landed the cargoes of ſeveral veſſels from the Weſt Indies, while under quaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:037274_0007_100CA4DCB9156B28"/>
upon or near the ſame wharf, at different times in the early part of June.</p>
            <p>The firſt caſes in the order of time that occurred in the neighbourhood of the ſtill-houſe wharf, were two boys belonging to the Eliza from Leghorn. Theſe boys were attacked with malignant ſymptoms on the 24th of June, and ſent down to the Marine Hoſpital, where one of them died. Mr. Shortall, the owner of the ſtill-houſe wharf, was taken ill with the fever about the 26th of June, and with difficulty recovered. James Arthur, Brady and M'Clary, worked in the loft of the ſtill-houſe. Arthur was taken ill on the 29th of June, and died with ſymptoms of high malignity and very yellow ſkin, in ſix days. Brady and M'Clary were taken ill a few days later. Brady died—M'Clary recovered.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Burk and her huſband viſited Mr. Shortall during his illneſs: Mrs. Burk was taken ill with fever on the 2d of July; her nurſe, little ſon, and an apprentice boy, a few days later—the appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice died; the other three recovered.</p>
            <p>The Eliza was removed on the 21ſt of June to Mr. M'Cullough's wharf, at Queen-ſtreet, a ſhort ſquare above the ſtill-houſe, for the purpoſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving repairs. Mr. M'Cullough's ſon was attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037274_0008_100CA4DEC2A137C0"/>
a few days after, and ſeveral in the ſame family in leſs than two weeks.</p>
            <p>At the time the Eliza came to the ſtill-houſe wharf, which was on the 19th of June, two veſſels lately arrived from the Weſt Indies lay at it, the one a ſchooner called the Minerva, on the 9th, the other a brigantine called the Abigail, on the 17th of June. Theſe being neareſt the ſhore, the Eliza took her ſtation along ſide of them. Mr. Green, in a ſmall ſloop with naval ſtores from North Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, came to the ſame wharf before the Eliza left it. The veſſel commanded by Mr. Green left the wharf the 23d or 24th of June, and proceeded on her homeward voyage, but was forced, on account of ſickneſs which had ſeized himſelf and crew, to put into Milford, on Muſkmellon creek in Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware ſtate, about 100 miles from Philadelphia, where the maſter, one hand and a paſſenger died, and only one recovered. The dates of the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing account are taken from Mr. Shortall's wharf book.</p>
            <p>The College of Phyſicians held a ſpecial meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the 28th of June, and agreed to inform the Board of Health, that a malignant fever of the ſame nature as that which occurred in Philadelphia in the years 1793, 1797 and 1798, had appeared in Penn-ſtreet and its vicinity, and recommended
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037274_0009_100CA4E143FC5708"/>
the removal of all veſſels as well as the inhabitants from that neighbourhood, and the prevention of intercourſe between the inhabitants of the infected parts and thoſe that were ſtill healthy, which at that time was the caſe with every part of the city to the north of Spruce and weſt of Front-ſtreet.</p>
            <p>On the 2d of July the College received an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from the Board of Health, informing them that they could not coincide in ſentiment with them, regarding the propriety of iſſuing a procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or giving directions for the removal of the inhabitants from the part of the town they had ſpecified, or the veſſels from the wharves adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe ſuch public notification would perhaps excite a terror, that might add to the prediſpoſing cauſe of the diſeaſe, if any ſuch exiſted. They were convinced of the neceſſity of early precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but they alſo dreaded to give an alarm which muſt injuriouſly affect the welfare of the city, and which might perhaps eventually be unneceſſary; the conſequence of which as it regarded the health was doubtful, but which would certainly operate powerfully againſt the intereſt of the citizens.</p>
            <p>Though a few caſes of the yellow fever occurred before the middle of June, its progreſs was ſo ſlow, that only twenty-two caſes had come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all the members of the College of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians from that time to the 6th of July. That
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037274_0010_100CA4E2CDB5CFB8"/>
the Board of Health might not be deceived, and the citizens lulled to a fatal ſecurity by this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, one of the members of the College ſent them the following letter.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter">

                  <p>I expect you all recollect, that every time the peſtilential or yellow fever has occurred in this city, ſince the year 1793, it has made its firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance near ſome one of the wharves of the city on the Delaware, and that it has been confined for the firſt week or more to the particular neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood where it was firſt obſerved, or to perſons whoſe occupations led them to frequent that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular part, or had buſineſs with veſſels or cargoes recently arrived; and that after the death or reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of thoſe firſt attacked, it has made a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able though a partial pauſe, after which it has gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually ſpread or been conveyed into more diſtant parts, and has rapidly advanced with the advancing ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>This having been the ſtate of the riſe and progreſs of the fever in former years, what reaſon have we to expect a different event this year?</p>
                  <p>We learn from paſt obſervations, that a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain condition of the atmoſphere muſt concur with
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037274_0011_100CA4E50BF16B38"/>
the matter of contagion, before the diſeaſe can be communicated from one to another, or be propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by contagion (which is the only way it can be propagated.) What that preciſe condition of the atmoſphere is, which favours the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the diſeaſe from one to another, has not yet been unequivocally aſcertained; but from the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of the diſeaſe not being communicated in high, dry, open and airy ſituations in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, during the ſeaſon when it is moſt highly ſo in the city, which is a fact, with a few extraordinary exceptions, well eſtabliſhed, it amounts to a degree of probability almoſt equal to certainty, that the atmoſphere where the diſeaſe prevails and is readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly communicated from one to another, muſt not only be of a certain temperature, but at the ſame time calm, confined or motionleſs, and, perhaps contaminated with exhalations from putrefying ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable or animal ſubſtances, or from living animal bodies deprived of freſh and purer air in cloſe and confined ſituations, which render it a fit conductor for the matter of contagion, at the ſame time that the air thus contaminated, by impairing the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent powers of the body, prediſpoſes it to be more eaſily acted upon by the contagion, not only of peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential, but of ſhip, hoſpital, jail, or nervous fevers.</p>
                  <p>A few caſes of the yellow fever have certainly appeared in the lower part of this city already this ſeaſon, amounting in the whole, excluſive of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037274_0012_100CA4E72179FDF8"/>
ambiguous ones, to twenty-one; and of theſe twenty-one, eleven have died. The exiſting caſes at preſent are indeed very few; and if we could depend upon the continuance of the pure and fluctuating ſtate of the atmoſphere in the city which at preſent prevails, there would be no ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous cauſe of apprehenſion. But as it is impoſſible to judge with any degree of certainty, in ſo change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a climate, how long the preſent ſtate of the atmoſphere, ſo unfavourable to the operation of contagion, may continue; and as there is the ſtrongeſt reaſon to expect the revival and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the diſeaſe with all its complicated horrors, if an unfavourable change ſhould take place in the atmoſphere, while any of the matter of contagion remains, however ſmall in quantity, and however obſcurely it may lurk, or if it ſhould by any means be again introduced: and, believing that the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the citizens, and perhaps the future proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the city, depend upon the meaſures you may deviſe or adopt for averting a calamity ſo awfully diſtreſſing, I beg leave to offer to your ſerious conſideration the following account of the means employed with the greateſt ſucceſs, in other countries, for preventing peſtilential fevers from ſpreading or becoming epidemic.</p>
                  <p>"The magiſtrates of the city of Ferrara in Italy, when all the ſurrounding country was infected with a peſtilential fever, obſerving the ill ſucceſs of the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037274_0013_100CA4E9B4E0C9F8"/>
conduct of their neighbours, who, <hi>for fear of loſing their commerce,</hi> did all they could to conceal the diſeaſe, by keeping the ſick in their houſes; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, whenever occaſion ſhould require, to take a different method: accordingly, as ſoon as they diſcovered that any perſon had died in their city of the diſeaſe, they immediately removed the whole family to which he belonged, or in which he died, to a ſafe diſtance from the city."</p>
                  <p>"The example of Ferrara was afterwards fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by other towns in the ſame territory with the ſame ſucceſs. In conſequence of which it was thought expedient to iſſue a proclamation for the information of the whole world: "That the only means of preventing peſtilential diſeaſes from ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or becoming epidemic, is to make the moſt early diſcovery of the diſeaſe that is poſſible; and as ſoon as its exiſtence is aſcertained, to remove without delay, and without reſpect of perſons, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſuſpicious caſe thereof, together with the family in which he reſides, and every perſon in the ſame houſe, with all their goods, furniture and apparel, to a ſafe diſtance from the city, and to clean and purify the vacated dwellings before any perſon be permitted to reoccupy them."</p>
                  <p>"In addition to the above regulations, Dr. Ruſſel, who publiſhed an elaborate and voluminous treatiſe on the plague in the year 1791, adviſes, that all
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037274_0014_100CA4EB43687790"/>
who have had intercourſe with the ſick, or who have been expoſed to infected articles, whether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentionally or not, be alſo compelled to leave the place where the diſeaſe has begun to appear, for a certain time.—"To permit the infected to remain in a populous city, is to collect magazines of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, ſooner or later to be diſtributed into every quarter, and of courſe to convert a whole city into a theatre of diſeaſe and death."</p>
                  <p>By the ſtrict obſervance of thoſe regulations, Cardinal Gaſtaldi, who was appointed commiſſary general of health, with diſcretionary and unlimited powers, ſuppreſſed the plague at Rome in the year 1657, after the diſeaſe had made conſiderable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. The Cardinal's rigorous proceedings at firſt excited great popular diſcontent and clamour; but as he acted with impartiality, and his proceedings ſucceeded, he afterwards received the public thanks.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1720, the plague was ſuſpended at Marſeilles by ſimilar means for ſome weeks, and, no doubt, would have been entirely extinguiſhed, if caſes had not been permitted to multiply, owing to this deceitful pauſe, a circumſtance which gave occaſion to the populace to treat the phyſicians and ſurgeons with indignity, for creating what they ſuppoſed a falſe alarm.—In conſequence of this
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037274_0015_100CA4ED7037C000"/>
conduct the diſeaſe made too great progreſs to be afterwards ſuppreſſed.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now conclude with obſerving, that if any reliance is to be placed on paſt events, unleſs you adopt the moſt vigorous meaſures for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, the diſeaſe will revive, and compel the citizens to conſult their ſafety in flight; an event ſo ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the intereſt and proſperity of the city, that it requires no great ſagacity to foreſee its final de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>population, as the inhabitants cannot poſſibly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſuch ſacrifices many years, as they have been forced to make of late. On your management and exertions, therefore, we rely, under Providence, for our preſervation from ſo deplorable an event; and I truſt we ſhall not be diſappointed.</p>
                  <p>The intereſt and deep concern I take, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with yourſelves, in the welfare of our fellow-citizens, I hope, will apologize for the intruſion and trouble which has now, as well as heretofore, been given you, by</p>

                  <p>Your friendly communication under date of the 6th inſt. is at hand. We are happy in having an opportunity of contradicting the injurious reports regarding the health of this city: reports which fear has induſtriouſly diffuſed and greatly magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. They originated from ſeveral perſons in one ſquare of the city having become ſick. Perſons who had no acquaintance or connexion with each other; each of whoſe indiſpoſition can be attributed to diſtinct and different cauſes ſufficient to have produced that effect; cauſes which would have operated ſimilarly in every country and ſituation equally warm. Their families, nurſes, and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants continue well, neither has any new caſe of ſickneſs occurred in the neighbourhood for ten days paſt, from which circumſtances the alarm has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſubſided.</p>
                  <p>We accept your propoſal of correſpondence with pleaſure, and ſhall cheerfully give every informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the health of our city, together with the probable cauſe which may have produced ſickneſs, ſhould it at any period exiſt.</p>

            <p>Examples in other countries of the influence of local and commercial intereſt over official duty, are common. No one is willing to believe the deſtroyer is at work, leſt buſineſs ſhould be ſuſpended and the intereſt of the city ſuffer. Time and temper are waſted on the queſtion, <q>how and whence does it come?</q> Every one endeavours to perſuade himſelf and his neighbour that it is not come, till he diſcovers it at his own door. Every one is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with him who pronounces the diſagreeable truth. Circumſtances are ſifted, and the firſt vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims to the dreaded diſeaſe are proclaimed to have periſhed by other diſorders. The phyſicians are looked at with impatience and reſentment, and though they are in no danger of being torn to pieces in this country by the populace, as they were in Moſcow in the year 1771, for telling them the plague had got among them, it was propoſed to drive them out of the city, or to throw them into the river, not by the populace, but by certain popular characters poſſeſt of more zeal than know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>

The prize ſloop already mentioned, was ordered by the Board of Health to the quarantine ground, and fell down on the 29th of June as far as South-ſtreet, where ſhe remained till the 1ſt of July. She then hauled out and proceeded to her place of deſtination.</p>
            <p>The fever had been dreadfully mortal at the Havanna, before its appearance in Philadelphia, as appears from the letter of Mr. Iznardi, Conſul for the United States at that port, publiſhed in ſeveral of the news-papers.</p>
            <p>The Amiable-Creole from Havanna, lay in the neighbourhood where the fever commenced, as well as the prize ſloop already referred to. Goods from the ſame ſickly port were alſo frequently landed at the ſame place, by the lighters already mentioned.</p>
            <p>It is alſo notorious, that the quarantine was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly violated, by perſons coming up from veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels under quarantine in the night, and returning on board before morning. Seven perſons from the city, at a later period, were detected going to the veſſels, and were confined fifteen days on State iſland by the Board of Health. Treſpaſſes of this nature might be prevented by the eſtabliſhment of a night watch. I have been aſſured by a wharf builder of reſpectability, that the maſter of a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037274_0019_100CA4F5A344E670"/>
from New England, but laſt from the Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, eluded the quarantine by ſwearing he was lately from New England.</p>
            <p>A liſt of the deaths in the city and liberties was publiſhed in one of the papers the 10th of July, from which it appears, that the average number had been for ſome time about ſix a day.</p>
            <p>About the 12th of July a few freſh caſes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in Penn, Little Water, Queen-ſtreet, and in the neighbourhood of the ſtill-houſe wharf. The alarm which had nearly ſubſided began to revive again. The Board of Health, in conſequence of this freſh alarm, wrote to the phyſicians, requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a return of all the caſes under their care.</p>
            <p>On the 15th of July, Harden a Stevedore and a man of the name of Pineyard were known to be dangerouſly ill in different families in Queen near Water-ſtreet; Mrs. Arnold and Mr. Roſs's daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in Penn-ſtreet; Mr. Lawrence, a cooper, bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the gauger, in Water above Market-ſtreet; and Banner Thomas, in Front below Chriſtian-ſtreet, dangerouſly ill. A freſh caſe of fever oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred the 17th, at the corner of Queen and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſtreets. From this time very few freſh caſes were obſerved till the 22d; on this day a lad that lived at Downs's, who had died ſome days before, in Little Water-ſtreet eaſt of Penn-ſtreet, was taken ill.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:037274_0020_100CA4F840B7BB28"/>
There were nineteen funerals in the city and liberties on the 17th, including two from accidents, <abbr>viz.</abbr> eight adults and eleven children. From the 17th to the 23d of the month, ſeveral perſons were attacked in the neighbourhood of Front, Lombard and Penn-ſtreets, in the families of Mr. Bridges, Mrs. Woods, Mr. Blackiſon and Mr. Thomas. Several perſons were attacked in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, at ſufficiently long intervals to juſtify a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion that the diſeaſe was contagious, eſpecially as ſeveral other families in the ſame neighbourhood were entirely exempt, which would not have been probable if the diſeaſe had ariſen from noxious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations floating in the atmoſphere.</p>
            <p>A lady moved from Penn-ſtreet to Wilmington early in July, and died there of the fever, but did not communicate the diſeaſe to any other perſon.</p>
            <p>A journeyman ſhoemaker who reſided at Downs's, died of the diſeaſe in Little Water-ſtreet the latter end of July, a few days after Downs's lad.</p>
            <p>The whole number of deaths on the 29th of July, amounted only to nine, ſeven of which were at the City-hoſpital.</p>
            <p>The Board of Health received official informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the beginning of Auguſt, of the exiſtence of the yellow fever in New York.</p>
            <p>

For the letter of the Board of Health of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia to that of Boſton, complaining of their ſubjecting the veſſels from Philadelphia to quaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, and their denial of the exiſtence of a conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious diſeaſe in Philadelphia, I refer to the True American of the 2d of Auguſt.</p>
            <p>I have received aſſurances from a reſpectable phyſician in New-York, that he is in poſſeſſion of unqueſtionable evidences of the importation of the fever into that city in the month of July, by the ſhip Gen. Wayne, from St. Domingo.</p>
            <p>The number of caſes had ſo greatly diminiſhed in Philadelphia by the beginning of Auguſt, that at a meeting of the College of Phyſicians on the 6th, only four confirmed caſes were known to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt in the city and liberties, and very few diſeaſes of any other deſcription.</p>
            <p>A Newbury-Port paper of the 26th of July ſtates, that the fever at that time prevalent there, was believed to have been imported by the ſchooner Sally from St. Thomas's, which arrived there the 27th of June, as no perſon had been attacked with the fever who had not been on board that veſſel, or that did not reſide or viſit in the vicinity of the lower long wharf, where the veſſel was unladen. It is alſo aſſerted, that no caſe of ſuch a fever had occurred, until five or ſix days after the arrival of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037274_0022_100CA4FBD1F2AE48"/>
the Sally, excepting that of a lad who came from ſea in her: ſoon after which, eleven perſons died in that town; two in Salſbury, and one in Newbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who had worked on board of her.</p>
            <p>The above account is confirmed by Dr. James Tytler, in a treatiſe lately publiſhed at Salem in New England, who adds, at page 535—"that of 30 perſons taken with the fever, in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of the wharf where the Sally lay, 16 died, the majority within the period of ſeven days."</p>
            <p>The fever in Philadelphia increaſed ſo ſenſibly after the middle of Auguſt, that the College of Phyſicians had a ſpecial meeting on the 21ſt and made the following laconic communication to the Board of Health.</p>

This communication appeared in ſeveral of the news-papers, a day or two after it was ſent to the Board. Conſternation ſeized every one that heard of it; and every part where the diſeaſe was ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to exiſt, was inſtantly deſerted. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, the Board of Health, governed by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy that I do not underſtand, or miſled by ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and miſtaken notions reſpecting the nature and cauſe of the diſeaſe, did not publicly acknowledge its exiſtence, much leſs that it was making progreſs, which was now no longer in their power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul, till the 22d of Auguſt. They then, with evident reluctance, acknowledged that a number of perſons had been taken ill the laſt ſix days, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in the lower part of the city and in South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark, ſome of whom had died after a few days ſickneſs; but that from the few caſes of mortality, and from the favourable change which had taken place in the weather, they were in hopes that a check would be given to its progreſs; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore "they did not think there was ſufficient ground for the great alarm which pervaded the city."</p>
            <p>The citizens convinced of their danger, from the frequent appearance of the herſe and the ſick coach, put no confidence in the declaration of the Board, but fled to the country in every direction and from every quarter; ſo that by the 1ſt of September a great part of the city, as well as Southwark, was
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:037274_0024_100CA50098522A70"/>
almoſt deſtitute of inhabitants. Many, however, who had no places provided to retreat to, were forced to remain: and many fell victims to the diſeaſe, who might have eſcaped if the ſignal of danger had been given earlier; and particularly if the line of communication had been cut off early between the infected and the other parts of the city, by removing both the diſeaſed and the ſound from that part to a ſafe diſtance in the country.</p>
            <p>The diſeaſe gradually extended to almoſt every part of the city eaſt of Seventh-ſtreet; but very few caſes occurred weſtward farther than that ſtreet, and not one either on Schuylkill or in Kenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, as far as I can learn.</p>
            <p>A few nights of ſevere froſt after the middle of October, deprived the contagion of its power, and put a period to the diſeaſe ſo completely, that the greateſt part of the citizens returned to their wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come homes before the end of the month.</p>
            <p>The Board did not begin to publiſh the daily return of deaths in the city and liberties till the 21ſt of Auguſt. From this time to the 18th of October, when they deſiſted from publiſhing them, the number of deaths amounted to 720, including thoſe that died at the City hoſpital. I believe it may be ſafely computed, that the number of deaths in the city and liberties from the 21ſt of June to
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037274_0025_100CA5022036C3E0"/>
the 21ſt of Auguſt, on an average, did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed 10 a day, including yellow fever caſes, which is leſs than has occurred many years when no yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever prevails; for that period is the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalubrious part of the year to infants and young children in Philadelphia, as September and Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber have always been to adults.</p>
            <p>According to the return made by the Board of Health to the Governor, the interments from the 10th of July to the laſt of October did not exceed 1276. During the laſt mentioned period, 324 pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients were received into the City hoſpital; of theſe 193 died.<note n="*" place="bottom">The number of patients with the yellow fever admitted into the Lazaretto or Marine hoſpital was 95, of whom 21 died.</note> The remedies chiefly employed were blood-letting, and mercury, both internally, and externally, for the purpoſe of inducing ſalivation as ſpeedily as poſſible.</p>
            <p>In the year 1793, 807 patients were received into Buſh-Hill hoſpital (which is ſituated in a much more eligible and ſalutary ſituation than the preſent hoſpital) from the 22d of September to the 6th of November; of theſe 448 died. The chief reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies employed in 1793, were, occaſional but very ſparing bleeding, mild laxatives, diluting drinks with vegetable acids, bliſters and camphorated ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous powders, partial warm bath, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:037274_0026_100CA5042B15D4B8"/>
In 1797 I do not know the number admitted. Bleeding was ſeldom employed; but mercury was employed in ſmall and repeated doſes, for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of inducing ſalivation. The proportion of deaths, however, was nearly equal to that of 1799.</p>
            <p>In 1798, in addition to free blood-letting and the liberal uſe of mercury in recent caſes, active emetics were frequently employed about the fourth day of the diſeaſe, for the purpoſe of "ſhaking the gall-bladder;" the quantity and vitiated qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the bile being at that time ſuppoſed, by ſome gentlemen, to be the principal cauſe which kept up the febrile ſtate. The proportion of deaths however was greater in 1798, if my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is correct, and I have made a careful inquiry, than in any of the other years that have been mentioned.</p>
            <p>Some of the nurſes became ſick at the hoſpital in 1799, but were all well when the patients were diſcharged, and the houſe ſhut up on the 2d of November. In the courſe of the diſeaſe, the alms-houſe and Pennſylvania hoſpital were ſhut; in conſequence of which the poor, with diſeaſes of different kinds, were received for ſome time into the City hoſpital.</p>

Though the diſeaſe pervaded different parts of the city, inſomuch that it was judged hazardous to hold the election at the ſtate-houſe in Cheſnut be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Fifth and Sixth-ſtreets, neither of the banks nor the cuſtom-houſe were removed; and, though they were daily viſited, and buſineſs tranſacted with them by gentlemen from the country, there was not an inſtance of any one taking the diſeaſe from that circumſtance that I have heard of: a proof that the cauſe of the diſeaſe was not diffuſed through the atmoſphere.</p>
            <p>No proviſion having been made for the poor, they were reduced to a moſt deſtitute and famiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condition; in conſequence of which many were ſent to the hoſpital, as well as ſeveral orphan chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. The compaſſion of the guardians of the poor being rouſed by theſe diſtreſſing circumſtances, they negociated a loan towards the end of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and appointed a committee of humane citizens (of which Dr. Samuel Powel Griffitts was one) to ſupply them with neceſſaries.</p>

               <p>The weather in Auguſt was very variable; the thermometer ſometimes as high as 86, at others as low as 76: and a conſiderable quantity of rain fell at different times in the courſe of the month, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (repeatedly in the firſt week) accompanied with loud thunder.

               <p>Very few caſes of the fever appeared this year after the 20th of October, nor did any perſon that I have heard of, take it after their return from the country, though they returned earlier than uſual; and but three or four that have come to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the courſe of the winter, though it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued milder and more moderate, till the end of January, than any winter that has occurred for ſeveral years: and no attention has been paid by the Board of Health, that I can learn, to purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infected houſes, bedding or wearing apparel.</p>
               <p>After the thawing of a deep ſnow in Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a catarrhal complaint, or diſtreſſing cough, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came epidemic, which proved mortal to a few chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and old people.</p>
               <p>In the winter of 1793, ſeveral caſes of the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever occurred which came under the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the writer of this ſketch.

            <p>I SHALL now proceed to ſtate the evidences and arguments, which have convinced me that the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever has originated from foreign contagion, and not from domeſtic cauſes, every time that it has appeared in this country: and, as this is not a queſtion of amuſement, but of ſerious import; not between different and contending parties, but a conteſt between truth and error, on the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which, not only the intereſt, but in a great meaſure the very exiſtence of our cities depend, I truſt I ſhall meet with a fair and impartial hearing.

In Port de Paix and ſeveral other places it deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch numbers, that the king of France publiſhed an edict, ordering all veſſels coming from Martinico to perform quarantine. And in the year 1708, penal laws were made, inflicting the puniſhment of death upon any ſeaman or paſſenger from thoſe iſlands that ſhould land in any part of France with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out legal examination and permit.</p>
               <p>It is related in Hutchinſon's Hiſtory of New-England, vol. ii. p. 72,—"that Admiral Sir Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037274_0034_100CA514C4EDE2F8"/>
Wheeler was ſent with a fleet to invade and conquer Martinique, but his men were ſeized with a malignant fever which deſtroyed three-fourths of them; in conſequence of this the fleet ſailed to Boſton and introduced the diſeaſe into that town, where it occaſioned dreadful mortality." From this account, however, it cannot be aſcertained whether this was the yellow fever or the common putrid fever.</p>
               <p>The firſt appearance of the yellow fever in Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes, of which any account is recorded or handed down by popular tradition, was in the year 1691; at which time the Rev. Griffith Hughes (Nat. Hiſt. Barbad.) ſays it was called the New Diſtemper, and afterwards Kendal's fever, the peſtilential fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the bilious fever.</p>
               <p>Dr. Warren, who reſided in Barbadoes, and publiſhed a treatiſe on the diſeaſe in 1739, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, "that it was introduced into Barbadoes from Martinique by the Lynn man of war, in the year 1723, and from the ſame place ten years after by a veſſel, the ſurgeon of which, Mr. Nelſon, was ſick on the paſſage, and died a few days after his arrival at Barbadoes." Dr. Warren adds, "The fever had broke out, as he was informed by Mr. Nelſon and others, at Port St. Pierre, ſoon after the arrival of a provençal fleet from Marſeilles."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:037274_0035_100CA516D74317E8"/>
"This diſtemper," ſays Dr. Warren, "cannot be reaſonably attributed to any corruption of the air that ariſes from lakes, marſhes or woods, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the land in this iſland is the beſt cultivated, and entirely free from lakes or marſhes, and, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately for the inhabitants, there is not a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of wood on it for fuel; but it is agreeably diverſified with hills and riſings, on the very tops of which the beſt canes grow. The air here is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo remarkably pure and freſh, and probably more ſalubrious than in any of the other ſugar colonies."</p>
               <p>Before the introduction of the diſeaſe firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by this author, into the iſland, he ſays he had for ſeven or eight years paid particular atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the effects produced on health by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſeaſons and ſtate of the weather; during which time ſome years had been diſtinguiſhed for ſultry heats and long intolerable droughts, ſome by almoſt inceſſant rains, and ſeveral by unſettled and tempeſtuous weather, and yet no footſteps of this fever did appear in all that time. He has frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved, that a continuation of dry and hot weather has been ſo far from giving any aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the contagion, that it has ſeemed rather to repreſs it, till the returning rains and a moiſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere have renewed its activity.</p>
               <p>Dr. Warren proceeds, "The reader may judge as he thinks fit of this account of the origin of this
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:037274_0036_100CA519ABCA6B30"/>
diſeaſe. I am ſatisfied that it was introduced among us the two laſt times in the manner deſcribed; and that it is not by any means the natural growth of this iſland, but truly a foreign intruder, let the firſt cauſes of it be what or from whence they may."</p>
               <p>This author aſſerts, that "intermitting fevers are rarely, if ever, the product of Barbadoes, let the weather vary ever ſo much, though continued fevers upon their going off, ſometimes put on the appearance of intermittents, and perſons with agues are often brought here from ſome of the other iſlands."</p>
               <p>"In ſome of the other iſlands, where the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours are muddy and the adjacent ground low and wet, the <hi>natives</hi> as well as <hi>strangers,</hi> are in an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent degree, ſubject to intermittents and remittents, reſembling double tertians, which are frequently obſtinate and irregular, but which with due pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration and precautions ſubmit at length to the bark." In another place he ſays, "bark did no good in the malignant fever. And that the iſland had not been entirely exempt from the malignant fever from the year 1733 to 1739, the time his treatiſe was written." And we know from the publications of Drs. Hume and Wright, that it proved deſtructive to the crews of Admiral Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non's fleet, in the year 1741.</p>

In a pamphlet, entitled, a Diſcourſe on the Plague, publiſhed in London, in the year 1721, it is related, that "a peſtilential fever was introduced into Virginia in the year 1697, by Admiral Nevill's ſquadron, which arrived there from the Weſt Indies."</p>
               <p>The firſt occurrence of the yellow fever in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, of which there is any record, or recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was in the year 1699. This fever is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Journal of Thomas Story, recorder of the city, who ſays, "ſix or eight perſons died of it daily for ſeveral weeks, and ſome days ten or twelve."</p>
               <p>From an anecdote reſpecting Roger Gill, a noted preacher of the Friends ſociety (who prayed in public that he might be accepted as a ſacrifice and the people ſpared) it appears the fever at that time was moſt general and mortal, the laſt week in September. And from the regiſter of deaths kept by the meeting, it appears to have entirely ceaſed before the 1ſt of November. The city at that time contained but about 600 families, of courſe its population muſt have been greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the mortality.</p>
               <p>In a letter from Iſaac Norris, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> quoted by Mr. Webſter, dated Auguſt 15th, 1699, the diſeaſe prevalent at that time in Philadelphia, is called the

And John Gough, in his Hiſtory of the Friends (Vol. iii. p. 516) ſays, "the diſeaſe which raged in Philadelphia, in the year 1699, was the ſame as that which has ſince been called the <hi>yellow fever,</hi> which had been very mortal in the Weſt India iſlands for a conſiderable time before it made its appearance in Philadelphia.

                           <p>It was in the year 1741 I firſt ſaw that horrid diſeaſe, which was then imported by a number of convicts from the Dublin jail.</p>

                           <p>The third time, it was generated on board crowded ſhips in the port, which brought in their paſſengers in health, but ſoon after became very ſickly.

               <p>"The cities of New-York and Philadelphia, have ſeveral times experienced the fatal effects of dangerous infections, ſome of them reſembling the jail fever, from dirty ſhips, crowded with dirty paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, from Rotterdam, which from that cauſe took the name of the palatine fever."</p>
               <p>At that time there was no legal proviſion againſt thoſe dangers: veſſels with this load of impurity came immediately up to the wharves and the ſick were landed in the town. The legiſlature of New-York have ſince paſſed a law for preventing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of diſeaſes into that city; but laws will be of no avail unleſs they are enforced with rigor and impartiality.</p>
               <p>We are informed by Dr. Lind, in his 2d paper on infection, that he had received information from a gentleman in Philadelphia, who had been a ſufferer by the diſeaſe, "that the yellow fever was introduced into that city, in the year 1741, by means of a trunk of wearing apparel belonging to a gentleman who had died of the fever in Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, and that it proved mortal to more than two hundred of the inhabitants."</p>

Dr. Lining of Charleſton, in a letter to Dr. Whytt, publiſhed in the 2d vol. of the Phyſical and Literary Eſſays of Edinburgh, gives an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the occurrence of the yellow fever in that city, in the years 1732, 1739, 1745 and 1748, and aſſerts, "that it had been traced to ſome perſons or veſſel lately arrived from ſome of the Weſt India iſlands, every time that it had occurred there." Dr. Lining alſo adds, "that ſome of the ſeaſons in which it had been epidemic or general were more cool and ſalutary than many that had preceded or intervened, in which the diſeaſe had not appeared at all."</p>
               <p>Dr. Mitchel of Virginia, in a letter to Dr. B. Franklin, informs him, "that a malignant contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous fever, (which from his deſcription appears to have been the yellow fever) was prevalent in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain parts of that ſtate, in the years 1737 and 1741, and that it originated from an infection <hi>ſui generis,</hi> and had been twice brought into thoſe parts by ſhips of war which ſailed in thoſe ſeas."</p>
               <p>From the year 1747, when it was again partially epidemic in Philadelphia and New-York, as appears from letters which have been preſerved by ſome of their inhabitants, Philadelphia was exempt from it till the year 1762, when, according to the notes of Dr. Redman, preſident of the College of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, which were communicated to the College in
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:037274_0044_100CA5298B4A5D98"/>
1793, it was imported from Havanna, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by a ſick ſailor to the family with whom he lodged near the New Market, in the lower end of the city, and from that family to others in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, till it pervaded nearly one half of the city, particularly that part below the great dock and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, which at that time was neither arched nor drained. It then ceaſed of a ſudden, about the middle of October, and was no more heard of in any of the ſtates, till the year 1793.</p>
               <p>For an account of the prevalence of the diſeaſe in Philadelphia in the years 1793, 1797 and 1798, the reader is requeſted to conſult the late publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the College of Phyſicians, entitled, "Facts and Obſervations on the Origin and Nature of the Peſtilential or Yellow Fever," &amp;c. in which he will find the importation of the diſeaſe proved by the moſt poſitive and undeniable teſtimony.</p>
               <p>Dr. Monſon, of New Haven, (a phyſician of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectability and eminence) in his printed account of the yellow fever which occurred in that town in June 1794, and became epidemic, relates, "that Captain Truman arrived there early in June from Martinique, in a ſloop that was infected with the contagion of the yellow fever, and laid at a wharf within a few rods of Iſaac Gorham's houſe; and that a cheſt of wearing apparel, belonging to a man who had died on board the veſſel at Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nique,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:037274_0045_100CA52CA0F2D468"/>
was carried from the veſſel to Mr. Auſtin's ſtore, and opened in the preſence of Captain Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Mr. Auſtin, Henry Hubbard and Polly Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, the three laſt of whom were infected and died in a few days after their expoſure to the contents of the cheſt. No perſon in the town was known to have had the yellow fever previous to the arrival of Captain Truman's veſſel." Dr. Monſon aſſerts, "he could trace every caſe that occurred to conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and that, of 64 patients which was the number that died of this diſeaſe, 44 had black vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting." <hi>See Webster's Collection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a ſubſequent letter, Dr. Monſon ſays, he was for a conſiderable time at a loſs to account for the caſe of a child who took the diſeaſe, as it could not be diſcovered that it had been expoſed to any ſource of contagion. But a man, after the termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the diſeaſe, who had been employed as a nurſe to thoſe in the fever, informed the family that he had taken it up in the ſtreet and carried it into the houſe, to prevent it from being hurt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceived by any of the family.</p>
               <p>By what means the diſeaſe was introduced into Baltimore in the year 1794, or into Norfolk in the year 1795, I have not been able to collect poſitive proofs; but from its firſt appearance at Fell's point, where the ſhipping lay, and from its gradual progreſs into other parts of the town, there is a
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:037274_0046_100CA52E2952BC40"/>
ſtrong preſumption it was introduced into Balti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more by one or more infected veſſels from the Weſt Indies where it had become before that time almoſt univerſal.</p>
               <p>The proofs of the introduction of the yellow fever into New-York in the year 1795, by the brig Zephyr, from Port-au-Prince, publiſhed by the Board of Health of that city, though controverted by ſome of the medical gentlemen of that place, are ſufficiently authentic and valid to convince any impartial and diſintereſted inquirer, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that <hi>year into New-York by that veſſel.</hi> Thoſe proofs may be ſeen in the Philadelphia Gazette, dated September 24th, 1795.</p>
               <p>In the year 1796 it appeared and became epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic in Boſton, and in the town of Chatham on Connecticut river. From whence it originated in Boſton has never yet been aſcertained; but we are informed by Mr. Webſter in his Hiſtory of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic and Peſtilential Diſeaſes, vol. ii. p. 344, after returning from his reſearches among revolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing planets, blazing comets, exploding volcanoes and wide-yawning earthquakes, to ſolid ground; "that the fever at Chatham was traced, in every inſtance, to a veſſel from a port in Hiſpaniola, which was highly infected; and that no perſon was affected without direct intercourſe with the veſſel, the clothing or the ſick. It was not taken
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:037274_0047_100CA53072420B08"/>
by paſſing along the ſtreet, nor from houſe to houſe. It commenced late in September and had no precurſors."</p>
               <p>Dr. Monſon, in a letter to Dr. Hoſack of New-York, aſſerts, "that the yellow fever was not only decidedly and clearly traced to importation at Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam in 1796, but alſo at Newbury-Port in 1797; in the latter place by a veſſel which arrived there in the month of May, from one of the ports of the Weſt Indies, on board of which one or more perſons had died on her homeward paſſage."

               <p>The following, among other circumſtances, prove that the fever was imported into Philadelphia in the year 1798. The ſhip Deborah from Jeremie, a port of St. Domingo, arrived at the quarantine ſtation the 8th of July with about 90 perſons on board, including paſſengers. After remaining un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der quarantine ten days, ſhe came up to the city, diſcharged her cargo, and proceeded to the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of Kenſington to be refitted. It appears by ſeveral depoſitions, particularly by thoſe of Col. Depeyſter, who came paſſenger in her, and Mr.

While at Port-au-Prince, Henry Philips, one of the ſailors of ſaid ſhip, was taken very ill with what is called the yellow fever; that during his illneſs, the ſaid Henry Philips told this deponent, (and ſeveral times ſince) that he had taken the yellow fever in attending on a man of his acquaintance, who had the yellow fever, and died on board an Engliſh brig at Port-au-Prince, while the ſaid Philips was on board ſaid brig with his ſaid acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.

hands with the yellow fever during her ſtay at Jeremie, and five on her homeward paſſage, and three paſſengers including one child." Theſe were reported at the Health Office to have died with fluxes: and it was declared on oath, that there was no perſon ſick at the time of her arrival at the quaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine ground but one black girl, and that ſhe had nothing but a ſlight fever and lax. But it appears from the books of the Board of Health, that three men were ſent from her to the Marine Hoſpital the very next day after her arrival, one on the 10th, and two on the 11th, with ſymptoms of yellow fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;

and that part of the clothing of the deceaſed remained on board. The firſt caſes that occurred in the city were traced to perſons that had worked on board or had done buſineſs with the Deborah. And ſoon after her arrival at Kenſington, which before her arrival was entirely free from the diſeaſe, ſeveral perſons who worked on board of her, and others in the neighbourhood where ſhe lay took the fever; the majority of whom died. The proofs of this are detailed by the College of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians at page 41, and are indiſputable. To op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe fanciful ſpeculations and arguments drawn from remote analogies, to facts ſo clearly and fairly eſtabliſhed as theſe, is not only trifling with our underſtandings, but is an outrage upon common ſenſe; and as ſuch fanciful ſpeculations have a tendency to ſupport and perpetuate diſtreſſing and unavailing apprehenſions, and to affect the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of all the commercial towns in the union, it is a grievance that demands the interference of the federal legiſlature.</p>

appeared to me alſo, that infected houſehold goods and furniture, brought from the city by our ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lops had more influence in ſpreading the contagion than diſeaſed perſons: for it was very remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the diſeaſe was not communicated from the firſt perſon who died of it, and who came down and ſickened it the land ſtage. But, when the fever became epidemic, it took its riſe at the water edge, and infected all, or with few excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, gradually up to High-ſtreet. Above this the town is more thinly built, and the caſes were ſolitary as in the country. Although the diſeaſe made its appearance among us, in the beginning of Auguſt, we hoped for our uſual exemption until near the middle of the ſame month, when the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demic nature of it appeared ſo manifeſt, that a committee of health was appointed, and a ſlight hoſpital arrangement was conſtructed, for the relief of the poor and neceſſitous."</p>
               <p>Dr. Brackett of Portſmouth (N. Hamp.) in a letter to Dr. Oliver of Salem relates, that "the yellow or peſtilential fever made its firſt appearance in that city about the 1ſt of Auguſt, 1798, eight or ten days after the arrival of a veſſel from Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nique, on board of which two men had been ſick before ſhe left the iſland, one of whom died on the paſſage and the other was on the recovery at the time of her arrival at Portſmouth: at which time there was not, nor had been a caſe of any
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:037274_0052_100CA53A9E633C60"/>
kind of fever for a long time in that place. On the 1ſt of Auguſt the day the veſſel arrived a child of the owner was taken ill with ſymptoms of cholera, and died on the 4th. On the 3d of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt his brother, 15 years old, was taken with ſimilar ſymptoms, but with more inflammation and diſtreſs. He was bled freely, took calomel, bark, &amp;c. and died on the 5th day from the attack. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the 8th and 20th of the month, four or five of the other children and ſervants were taken with the ſame complaint. One of the daughters, attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the 17th, and treated with bleeding, mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, warm bath and bark, died on the 9th day from the attack. She loſt a great quantity of blood from her noſe and mouth the three days preceding her death. Many other perſons were taken ill in the ſame neighbourhood between the periods juſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, about one half of whom died. I loſt 15 out of 45. If I could procure a ſoreneſs of the fauces by giving mercury in ſmall doſes, and by rubbing it upon the gums, or by external frictions, on the third or fourth day, I was ſure of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's recovery.—The diſeaſe was confined almoſt entirely to the ſtreets near to the wharf where the veſſel lay, and to the beach where ſhe was graved, though thoſe ſtreets are in the higheſt part of the town, are as free from putrid filth as any other ſtreets in the town, and have always been eſteemed the moſt healthy."</p>

To the facts which have now been ſtated reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the importation of the yellow fever into this country, and conſequently of its being a contagious diſeaſe, under certain circumſtances, I ſhall only add one more, lately furniſhed by Dr. Bayley, phyſician and inſpector of veſſels for the port of New York. In a letter from Dr. Bayley to the mayor of New York, publiſhed in different papers, it is ſtated, "that the ſhip General Wayne ſailed from New York on the 14th of April for Havanna, navigated by 25 men under the command of John Seaman. On the 25th of May, whilſt lying in the harbour of Havanna, John Brown a ſailor died, and John John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the 1ſt of June. During the paſſage of the ſhip to the port of New York, Jonas Willis ſickened, and died on the 14th of June. The ſhip arrived at the quarantine ground the 22d of June, at which time James Gardner, a ſeaman, was ſick with the <hi>Yellow Fever.</hi> He was ſent to the Marine Hoſpital and died the next day. On the evening of the 27th of June, Mr. John Wright, a paſſenger on board the Gen. Wayne, was attacked with the fever, and received into the hoſpital on the morning of the 28th. In the courſe of the diſeaſe Mr. Wright became very yellow, bled from the month, and had exceſſive vomiting of matter which was of a dark colour, but recovered."</p>
               <p>After remaining at anchor at the quarantine ground 22 days, and having undergone the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:037274_0054_100CA53F2A64EF90"/>
of waſhing and ſcrubbing the decks and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilating the hold, without unlading or ſhifting the cargo, this veſſel proceeded to New York, and came alongſide of Coentie's ſlip. Soon after her arrival, ſeveral caſes of yellow fever occurred in the neighbourhood of that wharf which was perfectly healthy before her arrival. This circumſtance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the declaration of Capt. Seaman, the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Gen. Wayne, that ſhe was an infected veſſel, which has been ſtated by Mr. Watkins, one of the owners, in the New York Gazette, exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated the inhabitants of that neighbourhood to ſuch a degree that they compelled her removal.</p>
               <p>In the year 1793, after an exemption of thirty years, the yellow fever (having firſt committed great ravages in Granada, Tobago and Antigua, in the laſt of which the inhabitants depend on the clouds for all the water they uſe, according to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count publiſhed by Dr. Lettſom, in the Gentleman's Magazine,) entered Philadelphia, and raged with uncontroulable fury;—but was epidemic that year in no other town in America.</p>
               <p>In 1794, it prevailed in New Haven, Baltimore, and partially in Philadelphia, while all the other ſeaports in the United States eſcaped.</p>
               <p>In 1795, in New York, Baltimore and Norfolk.</p>
               <p>In 1796, in Newbury-Port, Haddam, Boſton, and Charleſton.</p>

                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:037274_0055_100CA541768E1468"/>
In 1797, in Norfolk, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Briſtol, and Providence.</p>
               <p>In 1798 it prevailed with unuſual mortality in Portſmouth, (N. Hamp.) Boſton, New London, (the latter of which is ſituated on a high, dry and rocky ſhore, where there is neither marſh nor pond of ſtagnant water, and of courſe exempt from putrid vegetable exhalations,) New York, Philadelphia, Cheſter, Marcus Hook, Wilmington, (Del.) Peterſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, and Wilmington, N. C.—And in 1799, in Newbury-Port, New York, Philadelphia, Eden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and Charleſton, while Boſton, Dover and Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timore, and many other towns ſurrounded with putrid materials eſcaped.</p>
               <p>If this diſeaſe originates from the putrid exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſtreets and gutters, can any man poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of common ſenſe ſuppoſe, that the flats of Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timore and the towns of Charleſton and of Dover could have eſcaped in 1798, when the leſs putrid ſtreets of Portſmouth, New London, Boſton and Wilmington were thronged with the ſick, the dying and the dead? Reference alone to the dates and facts which have now been ſtated, in conjunction with the circumſtance of the diſeaſe appearing only in the commercial towns of the United States; one year in the centre, another in the ſouth, a third in the north, and a fourth in the eaſt, while intermediate ones have remained perfectly free

from its deſolating effects, afford an accumulated weight of teſtimony in favour of the doctrine of its foreign origin, which it would ſeem impoſſible for any mind, however ſubjugated and bigoted to former opinions, to reſiſt. But that no farther ambiguity may remain, reſpecting the origin of this dreadful diſeaſe, the following facts and arguments are added.</p>
               <p>It is aſſerted by Aſtruc on Peſtilential Diſeaſes; by Sauvages in his Noſologia Methodica; by Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portes and Dazille, both of whom were phyſicians of eminence in St. Domingo; and by Mr. Moreau de St. Mery, in his Hiſtory of the French Part of St. Domingo, page 700, "that the yellow fever was not known in the Weſt Indies till the year 1689, when it was imported into Martinico by a fleet from Siam in the Eaſt Indies, hence called the Maladie de Siam. Hughes ſays it was firſt obſerved in Barbadoes in the year 1691: and Ulloa in his Voyage to South America, book i. chap. 5. "that its firſt appearance on that continent was in the year 1729, and deſtroyed the greateſt part of the crews of the Guarda Coſta's at Santa Martha."</p>
               <p>This diſeaſe has ſeldom been epidemic in the Weſt Indies, excepting in time of war when fleets and armies have been ſtationed there: and, if the teſtimony of Blane and of other reſpectable authors is to be credited, it was ſo much confined

to the harbours and ſeaports in the year 1782, that very few medical gentlemen who reſided in the country had ever ſeen a caſe of it. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and other facts contained in Blane's work formerly deceived me ſo much, that I thought the yellow fever was only a modification of the typhus gravior, or the common malignant fever of ſhips, &amp;c. but recent obſervations and more accurate inquiries have convinced me that the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

From the ceſſation of the revolutionary war in America in 1783 to the year 1793, there were no traces of the diſeaſe in either Granada, St. Domingo or Barbadoes; and I have met with no author that has made mention of it in any other of the iſlands between the periods juſt mentioned; if there has, I ſhall be thankful for correction, for my ſole aim in this account is to ſeparate truth from error. But early in the year 1793 it made its appearance in the town of St. George, ſoon after the arrival of the ſhip Hankey, with a ſickly crew from the coaſt of Guinea; which was on the 17th of February. This fact is eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed not only on the reſpectable teſtimony of Drs. Chiſholm and Wright, but by the public

papers of Grenada and Kingſton, and by the Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Chronicle, dated October 12th, 1793.</p>
               <p>From Grenada the diſeaſe was ſpeedily convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſeveral of the other Weſt India iſlands in ſucceſſion, particularly to Tobago, St. Domingo, Guadaloupe, St. Vincents, Antigua, Dominique, Jamaica and Barbadoes; and ſince to Cuba, &amp;c. According to Dr. Clark, it did not reach Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica till the 12th of June, which was ſoon after the arrival of a number of refugees from St. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingo; a great portion of whom, contrary to what happened in Philadelphia, were the firſt affected and the greateſt ſufferers. In Dominica it was alſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the Negroes lately arrived from Africa, a circumſtance alſo contrary to the obſervations of moſt of the former Weſt India authors.—See Duncan's Annals for 1797.</p>
               <p>In Barbadoes it muſt have been communicated by contagion, and could not have originated there, as there are no ſources of intermittents or remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of the mildeſt form in the whole iſland, at leaſt not ſufficient to render the diſeaſe general.—See Hugh's Natural Hiſtory of the iſland publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the year 1750.—Even Antigua which is not only free from marſhes, but has neither ſpring nor rivulet on the whole iſland, has not eſcaped this ferocious and deſtructive diſeaſe.</p>

The immenſe commerce of the United States, and the ſhortneſs of the voyage, render the Weſt Indies to them the ſame ſource of contagion that the Levant is to Europe.</p>
               <p>During the exiſting war, though the yellow fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver has ſucceſſively pervaded almoſt all the iſlands, it has been moſt ſeverely felt in the French iſlands Guadaloupe and St. Domingo, which have been the principal ſcenes of military operations. With thoſe iſlands the American commerce has been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on to a greater extent than with any of the others; and as the American veſſels neceſſarily have had frequent communication with the fleets in the ports of thoſe iſlands, they could not avoid being infected. When the infected veſſels return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home early in the ſpring or ſummer, or late in the fall, the temperature of the air not being fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to retain or convey the matter of conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, no diſeaſe or only a few ſolitary caſes have been the conſequence. The reaſon that the diſeaſe occurs more commonly about the end of July or beginning of Auguſt, in the United States (though there are many exceptions to this fact, for it has ſometimes occurred in the month of May) is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is more generally epidemic in the Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia iſlands in that ſeaſon, as we learn from ſeveral writers of credit, than at any other time of the year, which is the moſt rainy ſeaſon within the tropics.</p>

In the month of June in the year 1793, a great number of veſſels, which were at Cape Francois during the capture of that town by the negroes, took on board and conveyed from thence a great many of the diſtreſſed inhabitants that had eſcaped the fury of the captors, to Philadelphia, as well as to ſome of the iſlands.—And it is a remarkable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, as recorded by Dr. Clark, that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe made its firſt appearance in Dominica a few days after the arrival of a number of the fugitives there;<note n="*" place="bottom">See Duncan's Annals of Medicine for 1797.</note> which was preciſely the caſe at Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. A few days after the middle of July, ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral veſſels from Cape Francois arrived at the port of Philadelphia, crouded with paſſengers and goods of various deſcriptions; and about the ſame time, or a few days later, a French privateer called the Sans-culotte, from Nantz but laſt from the Weſt Indies, which brought in the ſhip Flora of Glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gow, captured on her paſſage.</p>
               <p>The diſeaſe made its appearance the beginning of Auguſt, firſt in the lodging houſe of Mr. Denny, in the neighbourhood of the wharves where two veſſels which had landed ſickly paſſengers and the Sans-culotte lay. The firſt victim to the diſeaſe was an Engliſhman of the name of Moore, who lodged at Denny's. From the ſuddenneſs of his death and the livid appearance of the dead body,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:037274_0061_100CA54ED9280488"/>
Drs. Cathrall and Phyſick ſuſpected he had taken poiſon, and obtained permiſſion to open his body, but could diſcover nothing to juſtify their ſuſpicions. On the 3d of Auguſt Dr. Cathrall attended at the ſame houſe a female lodger of the name of Parker, who died on the ſixth day from the attack. Two French boarders in the ſame houſe ſickened a few days later, one of whom died. Mrs. Denny, her huſband and two daughters, were alſo taken ill a few days after the death of Mrs. Parkiſon—Mr. Denny and wife died: the daughters recovered. Mr. Philips's family, whoſe houſe joined Mr. Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's, alſo ſuffered about the ſame time. Several of the paſſengers had reſted themſelves on their firſt coming on ſhore in Mr. Lemaigre's kitchen, which ſtands near the wharf, ſome of whom appeared in a very ſickly condition, according to the teſtimony of Mr. Lemaigre and his clerk, and alſo of Major Hodgſon, Mr. Aſhbridge, and others, who commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated this account to Drs. Leib, Cathrall, and the writer of theſe pages. Three of Mr. Lemaigre's ſervants were attacked with the diſeaſe on the 2d of Auguſt; Miſs Phillips at Major Hodgdon's on the 6th; two of Mr. Smith's daughters and one of Mr. Andrew Hodge's, all of whom lived in the ſame neighbourhood, about the ſame time. All theſe were attended by Dr. Hodge (except the Miſs Smiths who were attended by Dr. Carſon) and Dr. Hodge treated them with <hi>mercurial purges.</hi> Dr. Carſon alſo preſcribed the ſame for Mr. Smith's family,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:037274_0062_100CA5506160EC00"/>
from a ſuppoſition that they were only violent caſes of the common endemic of the city (the remittent of autumn) and from recollecting that he had once experienced ſenſible benefit, when ill of a bilious fever, by taking twenty grains of calomel at one doſe, by the advice of the late Dr. William Smith.</p>
               <p>Capt. Swartz's veſſel from St. Thomas's, which lay a few paces above the veſſels that had landed the ſick paſſengers, was moved up to Kenſington about the 16th of Auguſt. The Captain ſickened two days after, and two of the crew a few days later: the Captain died, the others recovered. Soon after the arrival of Capt. Swartz's veſſel at Kenſington, the diſeaſe made its appearance in ſome of the families there, and ſoon after became general.</p>
               <p>For ſome time the diſeaſe was confined to that part of Water-ſtreet where it commenced, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every caſe that occurred for the firſt two weeks, could be traced to that particular place. The arrival of a cargo of damaged coffee a ſhort time before the fever made its appearance, gave riſe to an opinion among ſome gentlemen, that the diſeaſe originated from that ſource; but in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of others, it might with equal juſtice be aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a cargo of millſtones which lay in the ſame neighbourhood: for though there are many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances on record of intermitting and remitting fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers originating from the effluvia of putrid vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:037274_0063_100CA55287FED448"/>
in low, damp, marſhy and unventilated ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in the autumnal ſeaſon, when the ſurrounding atmoſphere is moiſt and impure, there is not a ſingle well atteſted example to be found of either the plague, or the fever called the yellow fever, which appears to be only a lower degree of the plague, or of any other contagious fever originating from that cauſe.</p>
               <p>The cities of Europe in ſimilar climates and ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations are equally ſubject to the leſſer tribe of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brile diſeaſes with the United States; and ſome of them that have much intercourſe with the Weſt India iſlands, and Cadiz in particular, have been invaded by the yellow fever.<note n="*" place="bottom">That it has never been epidemic in London may be ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the greater coolneſs and purity of the atmoſphere in that climate; though I have documents of its prevalence there in the year 1713, and of its being introduced into other parts of England ſince; but it has never ſpread ſince that time from one family to another.</note> (See Lind on Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of Hot Climates.)</p>
               <p>Many of the cities of the United States have now exiſted near 200 years, and Philadelphia more than 100. During this period, by clearing and cultivating the ſurrounding country, and by drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, paving and arching the reſervoirs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting the ſtagnation of water, and the putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of animal and vegetable ſubſtances to any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable

degree within their precincts, they have overcome all the natural and uſual diſadvantages of new ſettlements; in conſequence of which, fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and fluxes, once ſo formidable, had almoſt diſappeared in the cities for ſome years before the yellow fever made its appearance, particularly in New York and Philadelphia, as is evident from their bills of mortality, which prove them to be more healthy than any city in Europe in the ſame latitude, with a proportionable population.</p>
               <p>Dr. Monſon (whoſe name has already been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned with reſpect) in a letter to Dr. D. Hoſſack of New York, after aſſuring him that the yellow fever was clearly and decidedly proved to have been imported into Haddam on Connecticut river, in the year 1796, and into Providence in the year 1797, remarks, "that the name which has been given to this fever has occaſioned the diſputes which have ariſen about its nature and cauſes, both in the Weſt Indies and in this country. The fever called the ſeaſoning fever, to which ſtrangers are ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſubject on their firſt arrival in the Weſt Indies, has been confounded by moſt of the Weſt India writers with the peſtilential fever: and ſome of them have confounded it with the bilious or remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting fever occaſioned by the air of marſhes, or the exhalations from collections of putrid vegetable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; though it is evident it can have no connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the latter, becauſe the natives are equally
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:037274_0065_100CA55762D6A3E0"/>
ſubject to bilious fevers with ſtrangers, and alſo becauſe the bilious fever is not a contagious diſeaſe in either the Weſt Indies or in this country, the reverſe of which is the caſe with both the yellow fever and the common malignant fever of jails and hoſpitals.<note n="*" place="bottom">The malignant fever of hoſpitals, however, is leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious in the Weſt Indies than the yellow fever, but more ſo in this country.</note> Theſe unfortunate miſtakes have, no doubt, occaſioned and kept alive the diverſity of opinion and the unavailing controverſy which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. This I think clearly appears from the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous accounts publiſhed in the news-papers, and in Mr. Webſter's collection; for the gentlemen who have communicated their obſervations, moſt of whom had never ſeen many, and ſome of them not a ſingle caſe of the yellow fever, have taken its identity with the marſh fever for granted, and of courſe have confounded it with what they are pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to call the dock fever of New York, the pond fever of Sheffield, the horſe-neck fever of Montgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery, and the cabbage-head fever of Hartford."</p>
               <p>If the yellow fever, with its dreadful train of malignity and almoſt reſiſtleſs violence, was only a higher grade of the common remitting fever, and originated from the ſame cauſes, it has been aſked, How came it all at once to aſſume ſuch a new and terrific form, as there is no example of ſuch a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:037274_0066_100C85118CD41690"/>
and extraordinary change in the diſeaſes of any other country?</p>
               <p>To extricate themſelves from the dilemma in which they are involved by this queſtion, the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters of the domeſtic origin of the yellow fever have recourſe to an imaginary change in the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the atmoſphere, which they ſay has taken place of late years, and has become inflammatory: and, that this inflammatory conſtitution of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, in conjunction with putrid exhalations, which before this change of conſtitution took place occaſioned only fevers of a ſimple and mild kind in this country, now gives origin to the malignant and deſtructive yellow fever. In ſupport of this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, its advocates appeal to the ſeaſon of the year when the diſeaſe begins, progreſſes and terminates; and to the more ſpeedy ripening and decay of fruit, increaſe of inſects, &amp;c. than formerly: and, no doubt, they would have conſidered the Heſſian fly as an unanſwerable argument in favour of their opinion, if, unfortunately, it had not appeared too early for their purpoſe.—Mr. Webſter, with equal reaſon, conſiders the death of oyſters and large draughts of ſhad, as links of the ſame chain of cauſes which produce earthquakes and yellow fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver! But it ſurely requires ſomething more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial, to eſtabliſh a doctrine fraught with ſuch ſerious conſequences to the welfare and intereſt of the community, than the mere ſuggeſtions of fancy:
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:037274_0067_100CA558EA69F4B8"/>
And till thoſe gentlemen ſubject the atmoſphere to eudiometrical experiments, and demonſtrate that ſuch a conſtitution does exiſt, or that ſome material change has taken place, it cannot with juſtice or ſafety be conſidered as any thing more than the mere ſuggeſtions of fancy, and deſerves no more reſpect than the viſionary opinions which prevailed in the dark ages of Gothic ignorance, when the conjunction or oppoſition of certain planets were believed to be the cauſe of the plague.</p>
               <p>The following lines of Fracaſtoricus, who pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his obſervations about the middle of the 16th century, give ſome idea of this doctrine:
<q>
                     <l>An hundred years, twice told, have ta'en their flight</l>
                     <l>Since Saturn mix'd with Mars his hated light;</l>
                     <l>Which, by their baneful influence, did infeſt</l>
                     <l>The rich and potent nations of the Eaſt.</l>
                     <l>Hence rag'd a dreadful peſt, before unknown,</l>
                     <l>Which ſeiz'd the lungs, and made the breaſt its throne.</l>
                     <l>Four days it reign'd with dreadful ſway,</l>
                     <l>When life burſt forth in purple ſtreams and fled away.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The ancient doctrine of the influence of certain planets in the production of peſtilential diſeaſes, being the offspring of ignorance and ſuperſtition, and not of rational and unprejudiced obſervations, is deſervedly rejected. This muſt eventually be the caſe with the more modern doctrine reſpecting the change which is ſuppoſed to have taken place of
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:037274_0068_100CA55B1720BB08"/>
late years in the conſtitution of the atmoſphere, and aſſigned as the cauſe of the converſion of our formerly mild fevers into thoſe of a malignant and peſtilential kind—For this doctrine is neither ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by obſervations nor direct experiments: on the contrary, it is ſo palpably erroneous, that the New York reviewers have given judgment againſt it;</p>
               <p>1ſt. Becauſe it derives no ſupport from eudio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical experiments nor any other <hi>direct</hi> proof.</p>
               <p>2d. Becauſe it ſeems to be rendered impoſſible by the ſeaſon of the year, when theſe malignant fevers are moſt apt to prevail; i. e. the latter end of ſummer and the autumn, at which time, if at any ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the year, the relative quantity of the oxygene (or pure portion of the atmoſphere,) it would ſeem probable is moſt <hi>ſcanty.</hi> A conſiderable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of vegetable ſubſtances is then dead, and even the living vegetables, a principal ſource of that air, have at this time much declined from the freſh, vigorous and healthy ſtate in which they emit it moſt copiouſly.</p>
               <p>3d. Becauſe a greater proportion of the oxygene air, or inflammatory principle, exiſts in the winter, ſpring and early part of the ſummer, than during the remainder of the year, as ſeems to be rendered probable, by the brighter, and more florid com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:037274_0069_100CA55D237B4C38"/>
of people, at ſuch ſeaſons, and by the nature of the diſeaſes then moſt apt to prevail.</p>
               <p>4th. Becauſe if it was owing to an increaſed proportion of oxygenous air or an inflammatory conſtitution, the diſeaſe ſhould appear among the inhabitants in the country, more readily than in the air of cities.</p>
               <p>The late experiments of Dr. Carmichael Smyth, alſo appear to militate againſt this opinion. The fumes produced according to his directions to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy contagion, conſiſt, as Mr. Keir aſſerts, of highly oxygenated nitrous vapour, mixed with a large quantity of oxygenous or pure air.</p>
               <p>It is a maxim in philoſophy, not to admit any thing for the cauſe of an effect that is not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by accurate and repeated obſervations or direct experiments. Therefore, till more ſubſtantial proofs than arbitrary aſſertions or ingenious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, are offered in ſupport of this doctrine, it ought neither to be adopted nor reſpected.</p>
               <p>Equally powerful objections apply to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of gazeous oxyd of azote.</p>
               <p>The doctrine of Mr. Webſter on this ſubject, notwithſtanding his elaborate reſearches, appears
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:037274_0070_100CA55FBA0B15C8"/>
ſtill more exceptionable, and to be as much the creature of imagination as the tales of the fairies.</p>
               <p>Some gentlemen, confounding contagion which ariſes occaſionally in certain climates and ſituations, with that which is permanent and always exiſting, have hazarded and aſſertion, in contradiction to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived opinion and common obſervation, that the yellow fever is not contagious. This doctrine, if erroneous, would be attended with ſuch ſerious conſequences, that nothing but the moſt poſitive and unambiguous proofs ſhould induce any one to give credit to it. For though many inconveniencies and evils ariſe from the dread of contagion when it does not exiſt, there has been no truth more clearly proved, than that ſtill greater inconveniencies and injuries are the conſequence of believing there is no danger in viſiting and attending the ſick, when the diſeaſe is contagious. Surely, therefore, before the adoption of an opinion which, if falſe, would be attended with ſuch ſerious and fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, the moſt indiſputable proofs ſhould be exhibited.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the difficulties which attend all inquiries into the nature and properties of conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and the influence of various cauſes on its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, there are but few ſubjects on which people in general are ſo well agreed. And if men of eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition had truſted to the teſtimony of their ſenſes,
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:037274_0071_100CA56146601868"/>
inſtead of the fallacious pictures of their imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, many countries and cities would have eſcaped the dreadful ſcourge of the plague, the contagious nature of which, as well as that of the yellow fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, has been openly denied by men who have roved among the planets in ſearch of cauſes, inſtead of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the phenomena and occurrences before their eyes.—The reaſons moſt commonly advanced in ſupport of this extraordinary opinion, were, becauſe many of the attendants on the ſick were not affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe its progreſs was fluctuating, and it was moſt prevalent and mortal among the pooreſt claſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and might be owing to poverty, unfound food, unwholeſome water, and many other ſuppoſed cauſes. That this miſtake was eventually the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the moſt dreadful calamities, is well known to thoſe who have read the hiſtory of the plagues which have been imported from the Levant, at different times, into the cities of Europe. Similar opinions have of late been attempted to be revived in this country; but I hope the recent experience, and the good ſenſe of the people, will preſerve them from adopting ſo erroneous and miſchievous a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, which has a tendency to relax the vigilance of thoſe ſtationed at the poſt of danger.</p>
               <p>It is a fact well known to thoſe who have had the charge of priſon-ſhips or tranſports crouded with men, that it is not only from a direct com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with the ſick that contagious fevers are
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:037274_0072_100CA5634E2FD218"/>
occaſioned and propagated, but from the perſons and clothes of thoſe that have lately been ſick, or that have even remained long in an infected atmoſphere; that is, in that portion of the atmoſphere that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds the ſick, which being received into woollen, cotton, ſilk, and many other porous materials, not excepting timber and furniture, are capable, after having been conveyed a great diſtance and preſerved a great length of time in ſituations excluded from freſh air, of producing the ſame effect as an immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate communication with the ſick themſelves: of this fact, the examples on record are ſo numerous as to put the matter beyond the poſſibility of a doubt. It has alſo been obſerved by ſeveral late writers of diſtinguiſhed talents and information, that the moſt highly contagious fevers, in clear and well venti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated hoſpitals, do not in general affect the patients lodged in the ſame ward, but the nurſes only, and thoſe patients or other perſons that aſſiſt them in taking them out or putting them into bed, or thoſe that lie in the beds contiguous to, or very near them. The ſame obſervation applies to private families in large, clean and ventilated apartments; for there it is rare for any perſons but thoſe who are under the neceſſity of ſleeping in the chamber, or of approaching ſo near the ſick as to be ſenſible of the warmth or exhalations from his body, to be infected, eſpecially if they guard againſt ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppoſite to the courſe of the wind when the windows are open; for the matter of contagion,
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:037274_0073_100CA565789AFF50"/>
like noxious gaſes, only operates injuriouſly when concentrated and unmixed with pure air, and is harmleſs when diffuſed in the unconfined atmoſphere.</p>
               <p>The ingenious Dr. Hunter, who had charge of the military hoſpitals in Jamaica in the years 1781, 1782, and 1783, remarks that the typhus gravior<note n="*" place="bottom">The common contagious continued fever of camps, hoſpitals and priſon ſhips, &amp;c.</note> (which is known to be contagious in temperate cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates in all cloſe, unventilated and uncleanly ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, crowded with people) was never contagious in the hoſpitals of Jamaica, though they were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently crowded with patients with diſeaſes of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent deſcriptions. Dr. Lind informs us, that this fever, ſo extremely contagious on board ſhips, was ſeldom contagious in the clean and airy hoſpital of Haſlar in England.</p>
               <p>Both theſe authors, as well as the unrivalled Cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, are decidedly of opinion, that the contagion of fever received and retained in the wearing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel and bedding of the diſeaſed, is the moſt dangerous mode in which it can be communicated, and is much more certain in producing fever than when it firſt iſſues from the body of the patient. In ſupport of this opinion, Dr. Lind appeals to the circumſtance of the naked ſlaves from Africa eſcaping, while the convicts ſent to America with dirty foul clothing, generally ſuffer by it during
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:037274_0074_100CA56811043768"/>
their voyage, though much leſs crowded than the unfortunate ſlaves. It is alſo well known to thoſe acquainted with the preſent ſtate of medical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or that have been employed in military hoſpitals or priſon ſhips, that the fever which originates in confined and foul ſituations crowded with people, is of a continued form, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious in winter as well as at other ſeaſons of the year; which we now know is not the caſe in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate climates with either the plague or the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever, both of which prevail or become epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic only in the latter part of ſummer and during the autumnal ſeaſon; and which have ſo many ſymptoms in common, and have their principal ſeats in the ſame parts of the ſyſtem, as diſſections demonſtrate, that if there is any dependence on analogy, they originate from the ſame cauſe and are only different degrees of the ſame diſeaſe, varied in ſome reſpects by difference of climate.</p>
               <p>We now know from repeated obſervations, that the contagion of the yellow fever, like that of the peſtilence, requires a certain range of temperature, as well as a calm or ſtagnant condition of it, to enable it to operate injuriouſly on the principle of life. When the temperature of the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere is above 80, the contagion is volatilized and diſſipated: when as low as the freezing point, the caloric or matter of heat by which it is render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed volatile and active is detached, and it falls harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:037274_0075_100CA569988851B8"/>
to the ground.—This is illuſtrated by the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous juice of the Weſt India caſhu nut, which in a certain temperature riſes into the atmoſphere; and, though imperceptible to the ſenſes, when it comes in contact with a tender part of the ſurface of the body where the cuticle is thin, it occaſions a burning ſenſation and a painful eruption, which ſometimes excites a conſiderable degree of fever.</p>
               <p>I apprehend I have now proved the yellow fever to be a contagious and imported diſeaſe, by teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that can neither be denied nor invalidated, and conſequently that the doctrine of its domeſtic ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin is palpably erroneous. This is a fact of great importance to the true intereſt of this country; for if the erroneous doctrine of the domeſtic origin of the diſeaſe was generally believed, foreign com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce would ſhun our dangerous ports, and the veſſels of our merchants would be ſubjected to the inconvenience and vexation of a tedious and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive quarantine in foreign ports. This has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been propoſed at Marſeilles, as appears from a pamphlet received from thence by the ſecretary of ſtate. The induſtrious claſſes of our citizens, ſore vexed by cheerleſs poverty, would ſeek ſome ſafer and more favourable ſituation, and the ſtately edifices of our cities themſelves would ſoon crumble into ruins:—for few that deſerve the name of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional beings, would be found ſo prodigal of health and life, however powerful their love of gain, as to
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:037274_0076_100CA56BD0ECB3E0"/>
immigrate to, or venture to reſide in the ſeat of peſtilence and death.</p>
               <p>The arguments of thoſe gentlemen who contend, that the belief in the doctrine of the domeſtic ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of the diſeaſe would promote the intereſt of this country, reſemble the arguments of the athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, who maintain that the cauſe of morality would be promoted by the belief that there is no future ſtate of accountability; a belief that would take off all reſtraint from triumphant vice, and all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation from ſuffering virtue.</p>
               <p>My obſervations however incline me to believe, that although the yellow fever is never generated in this country, it is communicated from one to another more readily and certainly when the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere is replete with putrid exhalations, than when it is more pure or free from ſuch exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Prudence, therefore, dictates the propriety of removing from the city and its vicinity all putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable ſubſtances, and to promote coolneſs and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilation during the hot ſeaſon, as far as practicable; at the ſame time, I think our main force ſhould be directed with energy and inceſſant vigilance to the ſource of importation; convinced, if that poſt was faithfully and effectually guarded, our health would not be endangered nor our intereſt and proſperity blaſted by the diſaſtrous calamity of the yellow fever.</p>

               <p>BESIDES being diſtinguiſhed from the bilious fever in the circumſtance of contagion and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances on diſſection, the peſtilential yellow fever differs from every variety of the bilious fever, in the generality of caſes that prove mortal, in the following ſymptoms, which ſtrongly indicate that they not only differ in degree but in kind.</p>
               <p>1ſt. In the circumſtance of the ſudden ſubſidence or intermiſſion of all the moſt conſpicuous febrile ſymptoms in the courſe of the third or fourth day from the attack, and the ſpeedy ſucceſſion of a more diſtreſſing and dangerous train of ſymptoms, <abbr>viz.</abbr> inceſſant retching, ſtraining, and puking of mucilaginous or ropy fluids, but rarely any bile, accompanied with a burning ſenſation in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, ſtricture, anxiety, frequent ſighing and reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs; and ſoon after, by a bilious or deep yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low colour of the whole ſurface of the body, which firſt appears in the eyes, previouſly inflamed and watery and gives them a muddy and dull aſpect. The countenance alſo at this period is expreſſive of great miſery and diſtreſs, contracted and ghaſtly.</p>
               <p>2d. In the ſudden ſubſidence of all the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſymptoms, and return of temporary eaſe and
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:037274_0078_100CA56D5EB04708"/>
tranquillity, followed by vomiting of dark colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed matter reſembling coffee grounds, accompanied with bloated and livid countenance, moiſt tongue, deadly coldneſs of the limbs, diſordered and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded intellects, apparently renovated ſtrength, and finally convulſions. When, however, the chief force of the diſeaſe is exerted on the brain, inſtead of vomiting and reſtleſſneſs, a deep lethargy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the ſenſes, accompanied with haemorrhages and purple ſpots and terminates in death.</p>

               <head>A Review of the Different Methods of Treating the Yellow Fever.</head>
               <p>SINCE the publication of Dr. Chiſholm on the peſtilential fever which appeared in Grenada in the years 1793 and 1794, in which he recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends producing a ſalivation as early as poſſible by means of mercury, as the moſt effectual and certain method of curing the diſeaſe, the ſame method has been adopted by the majority of the phyſicians of America: and its ſuppoſed good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects have been accounted for, upon the fanciful principle, firſt taught by Sir John Hunter, of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one diſeaſe by creating another. But if my obſervations have not greatly deceived me, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury has protracted the fever and retarded the cure in every caſe where inflammatory ſymptoms have predominated, and inflammatory ſymptoms do
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:037274_0079_100CA571F684B210"/>
predominate at the beginning of the diſeaſe in a conſiderable proportion of caſes; except it be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in doſes ſufficiently large to occaſion copious evacuations from the bowels. Mercury has alſo invariably not only failed in curing, but has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably accelerated the fatal event in all the caſes in which I have ſeen it employed, either in large or ſmall doſes, when ſymptoms of malignity were evident. In more mild and ſimple caſes, milder remedies proved equally effectual and much leſs hazardous.</p>
               <p>It is true that in moſt caſes in which ſalivation was produced the patient recovered, and generally without any ſubſequent bad effect; whereas ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral have been reduced to the neceſſity of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding for life with the loſs of their hair, teeth, and even part of a jaw bone, and ſome with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions ſo impaired as to become walking ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles of wo! In ſome perſons diſpoſed to gout a ſmall doſe of calomel has impaired the digeſtive powers of the ſtomach and rendered the ſufferer hypochondriac. The pain and debility it has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times occaſioned, have thrown the patient into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions that have terminated in ſudden death.</p>
               <p>It was ſeldom poſſible to excite ſalivation in any caſe where ſymptoms of malignity were evident; on the contrary, mercury appeared to force out life in rapid ſtreams, and when ſalivation was excited in
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:037274_0080_100CA574072C6918"/>
mild caſes, it was by no means a proof that the mercury occaſioned the removal of the diſeaſe, but more probably that the ceſſation of the fever was the cauſe of the ſalivation taking place; for in ſimple and mild caſes, a ſolution of the fever gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally takes place without any remedy, on or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the fifth day from the attack.</p>
               <p>In caſes where mercury has been given or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued after evident marks of malignity have made their appearance, ſuch as blue or duſky ſpots on the ſkin, great depreſſion of ſtrength, reſtleſſneſs and haemorrhages from the noſe and mouth, or from the bowels, it has deſtroyed life with as much cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and almoſt with as much celerity as light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. We are informed by Kramer and Lind, that it once occaſioned the ſame fatal effects among the Hungarian ſoldiers in the advanced ſtage of the ſcurvy.</p>
               <p>Mercury was once in as much credit in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and cure of the ſmall pox as it has been of late in the yellow fever; but (with a few excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) is at preſent entirely out of credit in that diſeaſe, and would ſoon be the ſame in the yellow fever, if we were to judge of its utility from the abuſe or miſapplication that has been made of it, abuſe which has attached the idea of horror to the very name of mercury. There are circumſtances, however, ſometimes attending this diſeaſe, in which
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:037274_0081_100CA57621466AD8"/>
mercury has done the moſt conſpicuous ſervice, and in which it has moſt aſſuredly reſcued many valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble lives from the graſp of death. The caſes in which mercury has performed this extraordinary ſervice, have been accompanied with evident ſigns of local congeſtion or effuſion, and particularly in caſes of coma, in which the dilated pupils indicated compreſſion of the brain from congeſtion or effuſion. Under theſe circumſtances, it was given in large and repeated doſes.</p>
               <p>In the year 1744, ſalivation was recommended in the plague, in an Inaugural Diſſertation by Mr. Lowry of Edinburgh, in conformity to the theory which was taught at that time, that all febrile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes depended on morbific matter in the blood: a doctrine which has ſince been demonſtrated to be extremely erroneous.</p>
               <p>The ſweating treatment, by the means directed by Dr. Warren of Barbadoes, and by cordial and ſtimulating remedies, and the external applications of heat and moiſture, whether with or without a load of oppreſſive bed-clothes, as far as I have been able to learn, proved not only unſucceſsful, but in the majority of caſes that ſubmitted to it was a ſpeedy though painful paſſport to the grave.</p>
               <p>When tenſion of the pulſe, with hot ſkin, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated inflammatory diatheſis, and eſpecially when
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:037274_0082_100CA578B7908490"/>
accompanied with pain in the head, ſide or ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, in addition to the antiphlogiſtic regimen and frequent purging, by means of a ſolution of glau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſalts and tartarized antimony, blood-letting was of ſenſible ſervice; and in ſome extraordinary caſes, where no mercury was uſed, the ſymptoms called for it to a fourth or fifth time at the ſhort intervals of eight or ten hours. In mild caſes, where mercury was given in ſmall doſes ſo as to keep up an inflammatory diatheſis, bleeding has been employed to an almoſt incredible extent, and in many caſes without apparent injury; but as the diſeaſe was then an artificial one, and not the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal fever, I leave it for others to determine the propriety of ſuch treatment.</p>
               <p>In general, in the moſt inflammatory caſes, three moderate bleedings, when aided by the free uſe of cathartics, were the greateſt number neceſſary; and it was for the moſt part neceſſary to reſtrict bleeding to the firſt three days from the attack of the fever.</p>
               <p>In caſes where the fever began with great and ſudden proſtration of ſtrength, and the ſymptoms continued with great oppreſſion and weight about the heart, accompanied with pale or livid counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, low pulſe and moderate heat, and ſuch caſes were numerous, bleeding did manifeſt and irrepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable injury.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="unknown:037274_0083_100CA57A44EE0620"/>
In a diſeaſe, therefore, which varies ſo ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly in different caſes, no preciſe rules for blood-letting can be laid down; but the practitioner muſt be governed by the ſtate of the ſyſtem, which a careful examination of the leading ſymptoms will unfold to his view.—I do not pretend to explain the reaſon why the contagion acts as ſtimulant in one patient, and as a poiſon which expels or diſſolves the vital principle in another, and leaves every fibre in his body ſoft, putrid and powerleſs; but repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed obſervations warrant me in aſſerting this to be the fact.</p>
               <p>In caſes where ſymptoms of malignity and great debility in the animal powers made their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance early, or came on in the courſe of the diſeaſe, I think I have ſeen the fatal event longer retarded by the liberal uſe of ſulphuric acid ſufficiently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with water; waſhing the patient's body and limbs at the ſame time two or three times a day with cold wine, or brandy and water, than by any other remedies. The body and limbs were wiped dry after every waſhing, and covered from the air for ſome time. If ſenſible ſtrength ſucceeded the waſhing, it was encouragement to proceed with it in the ſame manner. When that was not the caſe, warm applications were ſubſtituted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="unknown:037274_0084_100CA57BE5A9EFF0"/>
When that dreaded ſymptom, the black vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note n="*" place="bottom">The judicious experiments lately made by Dr. I. Cath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, decidedly prove that the black matter thrown up by vomiting in the laſt ſtage of this fever, is neither vitiated bile nor putrid blood.</note> made its appearance, which was very common towards the cloſe of life, accompanied with ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pain, moiſt tongue, cold extremities, and pulſe ſlower than in health, no remedies that I have ever ſeen tried were of much avail—though ſome medical gentlemen in New York declare that they have recovered a great many in that condition by means of the free and frequent uſe of ſimple lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water and ſweet milk. Some inſtances have alſo been recorded, in other places, of the diſeaſe being cured by the liberal uſe of brandy and water taken cold.</p>
               <p>The cold bath, as recommended by Drs. Wright, Jackſon, M'Clean and others, was repeatedly tried in the early ſtage of the diſeaſe in the year 1793, in Philadelphia, but without the beneficial effects that were expected from it; in conſequence of which it has not been reſumed here. In the Weſt Indies, thoſe gentlemen ſtill perſiſt in declaring it ſucceeded, after the early loſs of from 15 to 20 ounces of blood, an active cathartic, and previous immerſion in the warm bath, the patient being put to bed immediately after the application of the cold water, and taking mild tepid drinks. This proceſs they adviſe to be renewed, without the bleeding,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:037274_0085_100CA57E8EDC0808"/>
in a few hours, if the fever does not ſenſibly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide and the patient feel relief.</p>
               <p>In the year 1797, Dr. Hodge employed full vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting in the early ſtage of the fever, after mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate bloodletting, with remarkable ſucceſs; for of ſeventy patients which he treated in this manner, he loſt but three.</p>
               <p>Wine, bark and opium, ſo frequently beneficial in bilious and typhous fevers, were found decidedly injurious in every caſe of the yellow fever—a fact which affords an additional argument in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the doctrine, that it does not only differ in degree but in kind from the bilious fever of this country.</p>
               <p>When the febrile ſymptoms ſuddenly ſubſided, and were ſhortly after ſucceeded by inceſſant incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to vomit, with great reſtleſsneſs and ſighing, which in dangerous caſes generally occurred on the third or fourth day from the attack, moderate and repeated bloodletting, clyſters, and bliſters to the ſtomach and thighs, and the liberal uſe of cool aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulated drinks, were the moſt ſucceſsful remedies, although the apparent debility ſeemed to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>indicate their uſe. In the latter ſtage of dangerous caſes with typhous ſymptoms, unconnected with ſymptoms of inflamed ſtomach or congeſtions in the brain, liver, or any of the other viſcera, boluſes of
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:037274_0086_100CA5812DD21270"/>
volatile ſalts, inſtantly followed by a table ſpoonful of lemon juice diluted with cool water, and in ſome caſes camphorated vinegar, have been employed with apparent benefit. Port wine and porter, as well as every other remedy that ſtimulated conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diderably or ſuddenly, aggravated the diſeaſe; whereas the diluted juices of freſh vegetables, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of lemons, oranges, grapes and currants, bottled ſmall beer and mead, were not only fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently beneficial but highly grateful to the patient.</p>
               <p>Dr. Ferriar of Mancheſter has found the nitrous acid in doſes of half a drachm, given three times a day, very uſeful in the latter ſtages of the common typhus, or low nervous fever.</p>
               <p>Dr. Garnet of Glaſgow and Dr. J. Currie of Liverpool have found ſtill more beneficial effects from the uſe of the oxygenated muriate of potaſh, in doſes of from three to ſix grains according to Dr. Garnet, and fifteen grains according to Dr. Currie, who directs it to be increaſed according to its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and remarks, "Sometimes it ſeems as inactive as any other neutral ſalt, but at other times it very much increaſes the heat of the body."</p>
               <p>As in malignant caſes of every kind of fever there appears to be an extraordinary deficiency of oxygene, if we may judge from the colour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of the blood, medicines which contain the
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:037274_0087_100CA582B66FEDA8"/>
greateſt portion of that material, and part with it moſt eaſily, promiſe to be the moſt uſeful remedies. On this principle, the oxygenated muriate of pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſh will be found ſuperior to any other remedy at preſent known; for "about ſeventy-five inches of extremely pure oxygene gas may be procured by means of heat from one hundred grains of this ſalt, to which the oxygene is ſo looſely attached that it is diſengaged even by the light of the ſun. It is rapidly diſengaged, and combines with combuſtible ſubſtances, as is evident from its detonation with ſulphur, and ſtill more violently with phoſphorus. We may therefore conclude, it will be readily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed by the carbon and hydrogen in the blood, and increaſe the proportion of oxygene, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any further tendency in the ſolids to gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene."<note n="*" place="bottom">Annals of Medicine for 1797 and 1798.</note>

The declaration of William Schooly, however, appears, from the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt taken in the cabin of the veſſel on the 22d of June, immediately after her arrival at the quaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine anchorage at Staten-iſland, to be incorrect with reſpect to the number ſick at the time of his impreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though it appears to agree with the manifeſt in other reſpects.</p>
               <p>Dr. Bayley acknowledges,<note n="*" place="bottom">See the preceding Sketch at page 54.</note> that ſome of the hands had died on board before and after her arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:037274_0091_100CA58B2A30A0F0"/>
at the quarantine ground. He, however, ſtill maintains that the diſeaſe was not introduced into New York laſt year by the Gen. Wayne or any other veſſel, but was generated by the mud and putrid materials of Coentie's ſlip.—In ſupport of this opinion, he aſſerts, that the yellow fever in the years 1797 and 1798 made its appearance on the very ſame ſpot, in the ſame month, and within a few days of the ſame time. In addition to this declaration, he aſſerts, ſeveral caſes of yellow fever had occurred in New York before the arrival of the Gen. Wayne. That there were a few ſpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic caſes of the yellow fever in New York is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by Dr. Hoſack, who has explained it upon a very different and in my opinion much more ſatisfactory principle than Dr. Bayley, who moſt evidently confounds the yellow fever with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon remitting fever of warm ſeaſons and marſhy ſituations, to which it bears no more analogy than the ſmall-pox or meazles. It muſt be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, however, that Dr. Bayley has ſupported his opinion with much plauſibility, and an ingenuity that indicates conſiderable talents.</p>
               <p>For the defence of his opinions, and the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances on which he reſts his belief that the yellow fever is not a contagious diſeaſe, the reader is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the New York Gazette, of the 16th of January laſt, printed by Mr. John Lang.</p>

               <head>Extract of a Letter from Dr. G. Blane, a Gentleman of the firſt Medical Reputation in England, to an Official Character at the Britiſh Court, from the United States of America, dated London 26th No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, 1798.</head>
               <p>THE adopting of meaſures for the prevention of diſeaſe, is one of the moſt important duties of a wiſe and patriotic government, and the diſcovery of theſe means, as well as the efficiency of the ſteps to be taken, muſt depend on a thorough knowledge of the cauſes by which it is excited and influenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. My opportunities upon actual ſervice in the Weſt Indies, in the late war, when phyſician to the fleet under the command of Lord Rodney and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral Pigot, and my preſent official duty as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the medical board of the navy, have neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily brought to my knowledge a number of facts relating to this ſubject; and I ſhall be extremely happy, if the communication of ſome of the moſt important of them can throw any light which may prove uſeful to the American government, in checking an evil ſo afflicting and calamitous.</p>
               <p>The firſt queſtion that occurs with a view to preventive meaſures is whether this diſeaſe be infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and under what circumſtances it is ſo?</p>
               <p>In thoſe ſituations in which I obſerved it in the Weſt Indies it was evidently ſo. There was the
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:037274_0093_100CA58F56BA0610"/>
moſt inconteſtible evidence of this both on board of ſhips and at hoſpitals, and the doubts which have ariſen on this point, ſeem to have ariſen from the effects of infection, being blended with thoſe which aroſe from other cauſes.</p>
               <p>But whatever doubts there may be on this ſubject in the Weſt Indies there can be none in the climate of North America. This will be the beſt proved and illuſtrated by an example:</p>
               <p>On the 16th of May 1795, the Thetis and Huſſar frigates captured two French armed ſhips from Guadaloupe, on the coaſt of America. One of theſe had the yellow fever on board, and out of fourteen men ſent from the Huſſar to take care of her, nine died of this fever before ſhe reached Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifax on the 28th of the ſame month, and the five others were ſent to the hoſpital. Part of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners were removed on board of the Huſſar, and though care was taken to ſelect thoſe in perfect health, the diſeaſe ſpread rapidly in that ſhip, ſo that near one-third of the whole crew was more or leſs affected by it.</p>
               <p>This fact carries a conviction of the reality of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as irreſiſtible as volumes of argument; and it further affords matter of important and inſtructive information, by proving that the infection may be conveyed by men in health.</p>

               <opener>
                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I received your favour of the 19th inſt. requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any evidence in my poſſeſſion, relative to the origin of the <hi>yellow fever</hi> as it appeared in <hi>New York</hi> during the laſt ſummer.</p>
               <p>In reply to your requeſt, I believe there have been two ſources of the diſeaſe of the laſt year; the one I believe to have been the remains of the <hi>poiſon</hi> of the preceding year, where care had not been taken to cleanſe or deſtroy the clothing and bedding of the ſick. It is alſo poſſible that goods which may have become charged with infection from being expoſed in the atmoſphere in which the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe formerly prevailed, may have given origin to ſome caſes of the diſeaſe which appeared the laſt ſummer. It certainly accords with the obſervations of practical writers, that infection is not totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in a ſingle ſeaſon. Upon this principle I ſhould be very much ſurpriſed if the yellow fever ſhould entirely diſappear in one or even two years after the moſt rigid quarantine that could be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed. But in my opinion this was not the <hi>only ſource</hi> of the diſeaſe of the laſt ſummer.</p>
               <p>I encloſe you a copy of the teſtimonies relative to the importation of it by the ſhip Gen. Wayne.
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:037274_0095_100CA59375C15658"/>
Theſe teſtimonies have been collected by a very worthy and reſpectable man, Mr. Thomas Storm. Some time after Dr. R. Bayley, our health officer, publiſhed ſome remarks with the view if poſſible to remove the impreſſion from the minds of our citizens which they were calculated to produce; a copy of which is alſo encloſed. You will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, he premiſes a declaration, that the yellow fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appeared in this city before the arrival of the Gen. Wayne, and refers to three or four perſons as examples, and quotes Dr. Miller and myſelf as the phyſicians who attended one of them. It is true Mr. Stephenſon died of the yellow fever; but if the foregoing <hi>principle</hi> be juſt, it will account for his caſe, <abbr>viz.</abbr> expoſure to the latent infection of the preceding year revived and rendered active by returning heat, which may have been retained in goods, &amp;c. To this I can add the caſe of another perſon whom I viſited, before the arrival of the <hi>Wayne,</hi> at the New York hoſpital ill of this diſeaſe: this perſon arrived in a veſſel from the Havanna. He told me that ſome others had been ill on board the ſame veſſel on her paſſage, and had died of the <hi>yellow fever.</hi> As he had all the characteriſtic ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the yellow fever, I reported him at the health office; he was directly conveyed to Staten Iſland, where, I am informed he died a few days after.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="unknown:037274_0096_100CA59585E8B200"/>
                  <hi>When we thus find perſons ill with this diſeaſe, or coming from infected ports, without paſſing through a regular quarantine, permitted to come to the city with their veſſels, we ſhould not be ſurpriſed, that caſes of the yellow fever appeared in New York be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the arrival of the Gen. Wayne.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſame letter of Dr. Bayley, he tells you that it appeared preciſely at the ſame ſpot where it had appeared in 1797 and 1798. But, he has omitted to add that it very ſoon prevailed in Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay ſtreet, in Warren, Murray and Chambers ſtreets, <hi>a part of the city which had been</hi> heretofore proverbially healthy. Whether it was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by contagion to this part of the city you will readily judge.—Theſe ſtreets have <hi>no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitories</hi> of <hi>filth,</hi> no ſunken, new-filled lots, no ſewers, no dead horſes half buried to poiſon the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere. If it were the product of the corrupted atmoſphere of Coentie's ſlip, and is not contagious, how did it get into this part of the city?</p>
               <p>Before I conclude I muſt add another fact which, in my opinion, is very much oppoſed to the favourite doctrine of our <hi>home-generating gentlemen.</hi> Our inſpector general of beef, Mr. Edmund Prior, a well-informed and careful obſerver, informed me that of 40 perſons whom he had employed during the laſt ſummer in examining the beef, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving and emptying ſuch barrels as were found
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:037274_0097_100CA59832EA12A8"/>
in a <hi>putrid state,</hi> not one was taken ill with the yellow fever while employed in that ſervice; and what affords ſtill farther confirmation that this is not of itſelf a ſource of yellow fever, 38 of the 40 were ſeized with a complaint of a very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent nature, the <hi>dyſentery.</hi>—The remaining two left him and for ſeveral days worked on board veſſels, were ſeized with the yellow fever, of which they died.—Their ſyſtems it ſeems were ſuſceptible of the poiſon of the yellow fever, but the putrid beef produced no other effect than it uſually does in all other countries. You will find in Pringle and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other writers ſimilar facts.</p>
               <p>As a proof of my candour and impartiality on this ſubject, and as an apology for my <hi>ſeeming</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency, I muſt inform you that in the year 1798, in which the diſeaſe was aſcribed here to the <hi>effluvia</hi> of <hi>putrid beef,</hi> having received informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Mr. Roorbeck, on Long Iſland, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the yellow fever, of which he died, from opening and handling a barrel of putrid beef which had floated upon the ſhore where he reſided, I communicated this fact as I then conſidered it, to Drs. Lettſome, Pearſon and Marſhal of London, and to profeſſors Gregory, Duncan and Hamilton of Edinburgh, as an evidence oppoſed to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I had previouſly entertained and expreſſed: I alſo added, if that fact ſhould be eſtabliſhed I ſhould not heſitate immediately to renounce my former
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:037274_0098_100CA599BA8D22C0"/>
opinion of its foreign ſource. But I have ſince been informed by a gentleman, who at that time reſided on Long Iſland, that Mr. Roorbeck, a few days before his illneſs, viſited a perſon ill of yellow fever, who had contracted it in New York, which at once invalidates the pretended and important fact of his having received it from the putrid beef. In the above expreſſion of foreign ſource, pleaſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, I do not undertake to trace it to <hi>Siam,</hi> or any particular climate or country, but conſider it as one of the ſame myſterious family of diſeaſes with the ſmall-pox, meaſles, plague, and many others whoſe ſpecific cauſes are unknown.—Here I muſt end for the preſent.</p>

               <head>Copy of a ſecond Letter from Dr. D. Hoſack, dated March 3d, 1800.</head>
               <p>THIS morning I received yours of the 28th Feb. requeſting permiſſion to introduce my laſt, with the documents incloſed, into your publication. Although it was written in haſte and only intended for your own inſpection, if you ſhall judge it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of being made public, you have my permiſſion to make ſuch uſe of it as you may think proper.</p>

                  <pb n="100" facs="unknown:037274_0099_100CA64FD6B216D0"/>
I ſhall now add a few obſervations on the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in addition to thoſe contained in the Inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Diſſertation of my brother, reprinted in your city in 1797, by Mr. Dobſon, but muſt premiſe the view of the diſeaſe which led me to adopt the mode of treatment I purſued, and which may not have been ſufficiently inſiſted upon in that Diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
               <p>I conſider fever to be of two kinds, either ariſing from the ſenſible changes of the atmoſphere, or from a matter of a peculiar quality, introduced into the ſyſtem: of the firſt kind are ſimple inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory fever, pleuriſy, acute rheumatiſm, inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the brain, ſtomach, inteſtines, and all thoſe diſeaſes which are purely inflammatory. Of the latter claſs of fevers are ſmall pox, meaſles, chicken pox, influenza, hooping cough, ſcarlet fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, dyſentery, yellow fever, plague, &amp;c. &amp;c. ariſing from certain noxious matters introduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſyſtem, which remain in it a certain length of time, producing more or leſs violent operation in proportion to the virulence of their nature, and at length "wear themſelves out," leaving the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy more or leſs debilitated, according to their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or their violence of action.</p>
               <p>I have introduced this obſervation to illuſtrate the analogy which I ſuppoſe to exiſt in a certain degree between yellow fever and all thoſe diſeaſes
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:037274_0100_100CA59BDE9AB780"/>
which ariſe from foreign matter introduced into the ſyſtem. In the treatment of this claſs of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, there appears to me but one principle to be purſued: to attend to the different functions of the body, that the action of the poiſon may be rendered as moderate as poſſible, and that every other ſource of irritation be removed, until the cauſe producing the diſeaſe be entirely exhauſted: and that the means of accompliſhing this indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be ſuch as leaſt debilitates the body.</p>
               <p>In the management of yellow fever I have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the ſame doctrine; in this diſeaſe there is a peculiar poiſon introduced, which like the poiſon of the plague, or of a venomous ſerpent, produced violent irritation and fever, with a derangement of all the functions of the body.</p>
               <p>When thus introduced, the principles of my practice have been to moderate its action, and to remove every other ſource of irritation: both of theſe indications I believe may be generally accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed by the ſame means, the chief of which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be—firſt, to remove from the bowels any matters which may aggravate the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly—To reſtore the perſpiration, which is for the moſt part obſtructed. I make this laſt a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate article in the cure of this diſeaſe, inaſmuch as the matter diſcharged by perſpiration even in
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:037274_0101_100CA59D71078F38"/>
health is of a noxious quality (as is proved by the late experiments of Mr. Abernethy of London) and if retained muſt add greatly to the fever and vitiated ſtate of the fluids which take place in this diſeaſe. As to the medicines I have employed in accompliſhing theſe intentions, and the different remedies adapted to the peculiar condition and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the patient, I can add nothing more to what are detailed in the above mentioned diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertation: they are the means I have experienced to be the moſt ſucceſsful. But that part of the treatment upon which I am diſpoſed to place the moſt reliance, is ſweating. Common obſervations have long ſince eſtabliſhed the importance of this remedy in fevers in general: but I was more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly directed to the advantages and neceſſity of attending to this remedy in the treatment of the yellow fever, by Dr. John Bard of this city, and the writings of Dr. Warren, in his hiſtory of the yellow fever of Barbadoes.</p>
               <p>If there is a ſpecific in the cure of any diſeaſe; if the Peruvian bark is to be relied upon in the cure of intermittent fever, ſweating, when induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within <hi>the first twelve hours</hi> from the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the diſeaſe, I believe I may venture to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert is a no leſs certain remedy in the cure of yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever. In ſhort, ſo ſtrongly is my mind im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with the ſalutary nature of this diſcharge in yellow fever, and I have been ſo rarely diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:037274_0102_100CA5A00E4CE768"/>
in its effects, that when I find my patient ſweating within a few hours after the attack of the diſeaſe, I congratulate him as ſecure from dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, provided it be continued a conſiderable length of time, thereby urging him to the diligent uſe of the means preſcribed for accompliſhing it. It is a remedy I moſt ſincerely and devoutly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to your particular conſideration and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but to ſecure its good effects, I again repeat the remark, that it muſt be employed as early as poſſible, after attention to the bowels, which ſhould be the firſt object of the phyſician's preſcription.</p>
               <p>Having been actively employed in the yellow fever of 1798 and 1799, I had an opportunity of purſuing this mode of treatment upon an extenſive ſcale, and am prepared to bear the moſt unequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal teſtimony in its favour. In the year 1798, Dr. Samuel Bard and myſelf viſited and attended about 550 patients with this diſeaſe—of this number we loſt between 60 and 70.—In 1799 I attended 98 perſons and loſt 12.—Although the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of 1799 is nearly in the ſame proportion with that of 1798, there is a very material difference as it regards the practice we <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the patients in thoſe different years.—In 1798 we loſt many perſons of great reſpectabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> who were ſo ſituated as to obtain every comfort which ſickneſs requires.—In 1799, except thoſe I viſited in conſultation with other phyſicians,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:037274_0103_100CA5A219A3F700"/>
which caſes are not included in the liſt of my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients, I did not loſe more then than four where they had the advantages of good nurſing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable lodging and pure air. In 1798, upon receiving the Narrative of Bryce on Yellow Fever, in addition to the teſtimonies of Dr. Ruſh, Dr. Chiſholm and others, in favour of mercury, both Dr. Bard and myſelf reſolved to employ it with the expectation that it would prove a valuable auxiliary to the practice we then purſued. We accordingly employed it agreeably to the plan re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by thoſe gentlemen. We gave it in the firſt inſtance with a view to its purgative effects, in doſes of ten grains—afterwards continued it as an alterative, in doſes of two grains, and in many inſtancès in conjunction with opium, to ſecure, if poſſible, its operation upon the ſalivary glands. In this manner we adminiſtered it to our patients for the ſpace of a fortnight; but that fortnight was a fatal period in our practice. During that ſhort ſpace of time near 40 of our patients fell victims to this mode of treatment. I truſt the friends of the deceaſed will forgive me for this candid declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when they reflect upon the motives which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced us to make this alteration in our practice. In every caſe wherein it proved fatal, it appeared to produce its effects by the irritation it excited in the ſtomach. For I rarely introduced mercury in the yellow fever where it did not excite vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or at leaſt ſuch a degree of nauſea as prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:037274_0104_100CA5A42553D4F8"/>
the ſtomach from receiving a ſufficient quantity of drink to operate upon the ſecretions; but in many inſtances vomiting was induced by the firſt doſe which was exhibited and did not ceaſe until the death of the patient. Salivation was very rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly produced by the uſe of this medicine.</p>
               <p>Having been thus unfortunate in the uſe of mercury, we immediately returned to our former mode of practice, which again proved as <hi>ſucceſsful</hi> as the mercurial treatment had been fatal. The laſt patient to whom I exhibited mercury was the ſiſter of Mr. Edmund Prior. Her ſituation became extremely dangerous, but ſhe recovered after ſix weeks illneſs. Compare her ſituation with the other members of Mr. Prior's family who were treated by the ſudorific plan, as ſtated in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement publiſhed by Mr. Prior, under the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature of a Citizen, after his recovery from a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere attack of this diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>If it were neceſſary I could ſubjoin many teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies of a ſimilar nature, in favour of the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by purging and ſweating, which has now become very general with our practitioners.</p>
               <p>But it has been objected to the ſudorific prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice by the advocates for the lancet, that it is very difficult to produce perſpiration. I grant that it is in ſome inſtances attended with difficulty, but I
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:037274_0105_100CA5A5ADB18280"/>
have as generally remarked that this difficulty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the ſlovenly and careleſs manner with which the remedies for this purpoſe are employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but in the greater number of caſes the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration immediately follows the operation of the remedies made uſe of to open the bowels. Theſe are ſalts diſſolved in a large quantity of water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gruel, given warm and very frequently until they produce ſufficient diſcharges by the bowels, aided in their operation by frequent draughts of warm gruel or warm lemonade. I alſo very particularly enjoin it upon my patient to remain in bed during the operation of his medicine, and ſtrange as it may appear, I add one or two blankets to the bed covering uſually employed in the ſummer ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the atmoſphere immediately ſurrounding the body may become warm and thereby relax the excretory veſſels of the ſkin. Its proceſs is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſucceeded by a very general and profuſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge. Where it is not ſufficient, I employ bricks heated and ſteeped in vinegar, with fomentations of vinegar and water to the legs. In ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances I have kept the lower extremities immerſed in a veſſel of warm vinegar and water for half an hour or upwards; at the ſame time ſupplying my patient with warm drinks until the ſurface of the body becomes relaxed.</p>
               <p>One of the moſt obſtinate caſes which I have met with in practice occurred laſt ſummer: the patient
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:037274_0106_100CA5A800047C70"/>
was Jonathan Burrell, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> of this city, caſhier of the United States branch bank. He was attacked with the uſual ſymptoms of this diſeaſe, pain in the head, back and limbs; countenance fluſhed, eyes loaded, ſkin hot and dry, pulſe frequent and hard. I immediately preſcribed for him ſalts and warm drinks in the manner before mentioned. After their operation his ſymptoms continued to increaſe, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a great propenſity to ſleep, bordering on ſtupor—his ſkin remained hot and dry, without the leaſt appearance of perſpiration. Finding the above remedies were ineffectual, I immerſed his legs in a veſſel of warm water and vinegar, ſupplied him largely with warm drinks, at the ſame time kept him well covered with his bed-clothes while ſitting upon the ſide of the bed. In this ſituation he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained upwards of half an hour, when he became faint, his ſkin relaxed and moiſt, and was followed with a moſt profuſe perſpiration, which was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued by means of warm drinks for the ſpace of three days, when his fever was entirely removed. During the whole of this proceſs he remained in bed, without change of bedding or clothing—this I conſider a very neceſſary regulation during the febrile ſtage, and an eſſential part of the ſudorific treatment.</p>
               <p>Another circumſtance of great importance in this mode of treatment, is, to continue the perſpiration without the leaſt intermiſſion until the fever is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely

removed: for the leaſt check that is given to this diſcharge is very apt to produce irritation at the ſtomach, which, if not ſpeedily removed, is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by that diſtreſſing and characteriſtic ſymptom of this diſeaſe the <hi>black vomit.</hi> In this ſtage of the diſeaſe I have frequently employed bliſters to the region of the ſtomach with great benefit; but I have generally remarked, that they were rendered much more effectual in their operation by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of fomentations to the extremities.—When the heat and burning at the ſtomach are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by theſe remedies, and <hi>black vomit</hi> ſucceeds, we have little to hope of ſucceſs from any ſource whatever. <hi>Yeast</hi> and the <hi>ſaline mixture</hi> have occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally given relief in this deſperate period of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe; but there is one ſpecies of the black vomit wherein the matter diſcharged exhibits the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of coffee-grounds, in which I have been more ſucceſsful in the uſe of lime-water than with any other remedy—but that ſpecies of black vomit, wherein the matter diſcharged appears in the form of <hi>black flakes</hi> indicating a deſtruction of the coats of the ſtomach, I have never ſeen removed by lime-water or any other remedy. But in the firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſpecies, if it were neceſſary I could enumerate more than twenty caſes, wherein this generally fatal ſymptom has been removed and the patients reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by the uſe of the lime-water. In the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advertiſement Dr. Bard bears witneſs to its ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in theſe caſes: if it were required he could add

                     <p>A caſe of black vomit relieved by lime-water, which I at preſent recollect, was that of Weſt, whom I attended with Dr. Hamerſley in '98. Laſt year, you know, I was out of town. This was a decided caſe, and was attended with haemorrhage from the noſe. The uſe of lime-water was, in this inſtance, attended with the happieſt effect.</p>

               <p>Many reſpectable practitioners in this city have informed me that they have exhibited this remedy with great advantage, not only in removing the black vomit, but in allaying the <hi>heat, burning,</hi> and <hi>pain at the stomach,</hi> which are the uſual precurſors of the black vomit—but with many other medical gentlemen both in New York and Philadelphia, I find that lime-water has acquired but little reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Their want of ſucceſs in the uſe of it I aſcribe to ſeveral cauſes: the firſt is, that it was not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed until every other remedy had failed; ſeveral inſtances of this ſort I have met with, in which it was not adminiſtered until the pulſe was ſcarcely to be perceived, the extremities cold, and the vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="111" facs="unknown:037274_0110_100CA5B14C03B2E8"/>
in which time the powers of life were nearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted. A ſecond cauſe of want of ſucceſs is, the exhibition of other remedies at the ſame time that the lime-water is employed. I have frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved thoſe gentlemen who are partial to the uſe of mercury, to continue the uſe of that medicine at the ſame time the lime-water was given. As the operation of mercury generally produces irritation at the ſtomach, nauſea and vomiting, it is ſcarcely to be expected of lime-water or any other remedy to compoſe the ſtomach under thoſe circumſtances. I ſhould as readily expect that lime-water would allay vomiting at the moment <hi>tartar emetic</hi> was exhibited with the view to excite it.</p>
               <p>A third cauſe of the unſucceſsful uſe of lime-water is the want of perſeverance in the uſe of it. I was credibly informed, that a practitioner in this city who ſtands high in his profeſſion, upon hearing of this remedy, adminiſtered a ſingle doſe of it, and upon its failure has never employed it a ſecond time, but affects to deſpiſe it as inert and uſeleſs.</p>
               <p>When I firſt employed lime-water in the yellow fever, I generally directed it to be mixed with an equal quantity of milk, and a wineglaſs-<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> the mixture to be given every hour. Since that time, I have in ſeveral inſtances given it in porter with bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, where the mixture of it with milk was rejected. A Mr. Graham, whom I viſited laſt ſummer, on Long Iſland, is a ſtriking example of the advantage
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:037274_0111_100CA5B2D410BFD0"/>
of this combination. Porter when given alone ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failed to excite heat and pain at the ſtomach, which continued until it was diſcharged by vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but mixed with the lime-water thoſe ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms were all allayed, and by the continuance of this remedy he was reſtored to health.</p>
               <p>If the above rude and haſty outline of my practice in yellow fever may contain any hints which may prove of public utility, you are welcome to make ſuch uſe of them as you may think proper.</p>

               <head>POST SCRIPT BY THE EDITOR.</head>
               <p>My review of the ſudorific plan of treating this diſeaſe was printed before I received Dr. Hoſack's account of its ſucceſs in New York: and as it only applies to the mode in which it was conducted in a few caſes in Philadelphia, it by no means applies to the mode of conducting it which he ſo forcibly recommends on the authority of repeated facts.</p>
               <p>From the experiments lately made by Dr. Cathrall, it appears that lime-water produces its ſalutary effects by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting the corroſive acid which is generally contained in the ſtomach at the time the black vomiting commences. On this principle calcined magneſia would have a ſimilar effect.</p>
