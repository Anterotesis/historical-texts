            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>IT muſt appear at firſt glance to be of infinite importance to the authors and abettors of the doctrine of univerſal ſalvation, that they conſider well the ground on which they ſtand. The error, (if it be one) cannot be ſmall, or of little conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. It ſtrikes at the character and government of Jehovah the Eternal King. If they ſhould be found talking wickedly for God, and pleading de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully for him, the caſe is dreadful! The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of the doctrine to their own ſouls cannot be unintereſting, and if they be contributing their exertions to harden the hearts of the impenitent, to ſooth and flatter them in ſin, and ſing them into a deeper ſleep on the falling brink of eternal ruin; how tremenduous is the idea! The apoſtle ſays, knowing the terror of the Lord we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men; our God is a conſuming fire; it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. Hope and fear ſeem to be the two powerful ſprings of action in the human mind. The goſpel is a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ſerious addreſs to both; there the lightnings of God's wrath flaſh; his thunders roar; his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, purity, truth and juſtice appear in terrible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray; there alſo his love and goodneſs aſſume the moſt winning aſpect; his grace and mercy ſhine with the moſt amiable radiance. But there is no truth in all the book of God more clear, than that an acceptance of the Saviour and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:020203_0003_0FAE3C6EF3F17858"/>
to him, are indiſpenſibly neceſſary to our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by him; and that this acceptance and ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion muſt take place in this life, in order to gain that end, one would think, is pretty clearly taught alſo. The doctrine of a diſpenſation of the goſpel in hell, or of tenders of grace and mercy there, to ſay the leaſt of it, does not ſound well. The author of this is a lover of mankind, and of divine truth; he wiſhes to follow truth wherever it leads. If the new doctrine be truth, he wiſhes to ſee it. From love to mankind, and he hopes, a ſincere regard to their ſalvation, he has given his ſentiments on it, which he ſubmits to the candour of the public.</p>

            <head>BRIEF ANIMADVERSIONS ON THE DOCTRINE OF UNIVERSAL SALVATION.</head>
            <p>IN order to a clear perception of the abſurdity of that doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which I am about to conſider, it may be proper to premiſe ſome obſervations on the nature of God's moral go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; as inattention to this, ſeems to lie at the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the new ſcheme. The idea of puniſhing men for their ſins appears hideous, and the idea of eternal puniſhment much more ſo. The doctrine of univerſal ſalvation is extremely po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular, and bears the ſemblance of great benevolence in its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. But were it even true, ſome have queſtioned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it would ſhew benevolence to propagate it, as it can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce no good effects on ſociety. But if falſe, as moſt certainly it is, it is the moſt ſhocking cruelty to deceive men with a lie.</p>
            <p>It will be readily granted by all men, that God has an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted right to give laws to his creatures. He has a proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in them which is altogether ſingular. He is the univerſal parent, the creator and preſerver of all creatures. Has a father a right to govern his family? a governor to execute the laws of his government? much more has the father of all, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme governor of the univerſe, a right to give laws to the workmanſhip of his own hands and ſee them execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It muſt alſo be granted, that the goodneſs of God is clearly manifeſted in giving laws to his creatures, for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of their conduct. This is a remark to which we ſhould carefully attend. We are apt to ſuppoſe, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine goodneſs is diſplayed only in giving us theſe things which we call benefits or mercies; and that his laws are arbitrary, unneceſſary and unreaſonable reſtraints. But this is far from being the caſe; for the divine laws are all calculated not only to promote the glory of the lawgiver, but alſo the good of the creation. This remark is univerſally true. It is by the laws of the ſyſtem that the ſyſtem is uphold. Were the law of attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or gravity to ceaſe, this globe would fall to pieces, perhaps to annihilation. Were the ſun to depart from the center and flame lawleſs through the mighty void. Were the planets to fly off from their orbits and ruſh wildly through the vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe: or were the ſea to riſe from its bed and daſh itſelf over
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:020203_0005_0FAE3C70777C44F8"/>
its boundaries on the face of the earth: or were the brutal tribes to loſe their reverence for man and riſe in one general conſpiracy againſt his life: on all, on any of theſe ſuppoſitions, the life of man would be totally extinguiſhed: on ſome of them matter would be wreck'd on matter, and worlds cruſh'd on worlds. But what are theſe ſuppoſitions? they are no more than to ſuppoſe that God ſhould revoke, or that theſe creatures ſhould tranſgreſs were it poſſible the laws which God hath given them. But ſhall we ſuppoſe ſuch terrible conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences to follow on inanimate or irrational creatures tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing the laws of their nature; and no ill conſequences to follow on rational and ſpiritual beings tranſgreſſing the laws of theirs? That is, ſhall we ſuppoſe that matter is more excellent than ſpirit; the laws of matter more noble than the laws of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; or the deſtruction of matter more terrible than the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of ſpirits? That the divine laws are all culculated for the good of man, is manifeſt. It will readily appear to any attentive obſerver, that the principal part of our miſeries flows from the wickedneſs of man's nature and life. His unruly paſſions have broken looſe from the reins of reaſon. They are an overflowing ſource of miſery to himſelf and his fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. From whence come wars and fightings among you? ſays the apoſtle, come they not of your luſts which war in your members. Whence is it that this world is deluged with human blood? whence the neceſſity of gaols and gibbets? whence fraud, cruelty, injuſtice, extortion, oppreſſion, thefts, robberies, murders and all the works of the fleſh mentioned by the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Gal. 5th chap. proceed they not from the wicked heart of man; which is ſaid to be deceitful above all things and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately wicked? Yes, the carnal mind is enmity againſt God; and is not ſubject to his law, neither indeed can be. Out of the heart do proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, thefts, falſe witneſs and blaſphemies. This is the poiſoned fountain which deluges the world with ſin and miſery. This is the corrupt tree which bears corrupt fruit in a great abundance. And on the whole, what a happy world would this be; take it in every other way juſt as it is; were men to be and do to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others, what the laws of God require them to be and do?</p>
            <p>It is true man is not governed, and cannot be governed by the ſame kind of laws as the irrational and inanimate creatures. No, he muſt be governed by laws ſuited to his nature whatever
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:020203_0006_0FAE3C71447EC5A8"/>
that be, as they are by laws ſuited to their nature. Wherein he partakes with them in any thing common to their nature, he is governed by the ſame laws. His material body is ſubject to the law of gravity or attraction as well as other pieces of matter; and in ſubmiſſion to this, his will has no choice; and in many perſons the underſtanding no knowledge. He has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctive propenſities in his nature, which are common to him with the brutes, viz. to propagate his ſpecies and preſerve his life. And as in theſe he aſcends in the ſcale of being nearer to intelligence, his underſtanding and will have ſcope for exerciſe, in the direction and government of them. It is true, he can no more, by any act of his underſtanding and will, eradicate theſe propenſities from his nature, than the brutes can; and it is fit and proper it ſhould be ſo, they were never intended to be eradicated. They anſwer moſt valuable purpoſes in God's creation. But they ought to be kept by him under the conduct and guidance of reaſon; and moſt certainly a man yielding to theſe propenſities without the government of reaſon, levels himſelf to an equality with the brutes; nay, degrades himſelf far below them, for they act according to the complete ſyſtem of laws in their nature; but he does not; his rational and ſpiritual powers are proſtrated in the duſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe propenſities above mentioned, clearly belong to his material and animal part. His rational and ſpiritual part muſt be governed in a quite different and far higher manner. Man is a rational, intelligent, a free, and therefore a moral a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. He is capable of acting ſpontaneouſly or from choice; and God will be ſerved by him agreeably to the exalted rank which he holds in the ſcale of being, that is, not from neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity but choice. In a word, man cannot be governed ſolely by inſtinct, for this good reaſon, he is not a brute, nor can he be under a mechanical government, becauſe he is not a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine; nor can he be governed by neceſſity and force, becauſe he is not inanimate matter. Therefore the method which God has taken to govern him (and none other could be ſuitable to his nature) is, to propoſe a law, holy, juſt and good to his reaſon, enforce it by his rightful and dread authority, and ſecure obedience by a penal ſanction. The authority of the lawgiver and goodneſs of the law, are calculated to gain the aſſent of his reaſon; the promiſe of felicity in caſe of obedience, to engage the conſent of his will; the penal ſanction to work on his fears, and deter him from diſobedience. It is clear that a penal ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:020203_0007_0FAE3C720F7ECFE8"/>
is neceſſary to conſtitute a moral law; without it there can be no ſuch law. The precept, if we may on this ſuppoſition call it ſo, will amount to no more than a ſimple advice. If the creature take it, it is well; if not, there is no danger; and thus the will of the creature, not that of the lawgiver is the rule, which will place man totally independent of God. It is further manifeſt, that if a law once had a penalty annexed to it; but after a while the penalty be taken away; in that caſe we may certainly affirm, the law is repealed; or which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to the ſame thing, if the penalty be not executed in caſe of tranſgreſſion, there is a total repeal of the law; hence it follows, that the divine goodneſs is manifeſted not only in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a law to man, but alſo in enforcing obedience by a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſanction, and in executing the penalty in caſe of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. Is the divine goodneſs diſplayed in ſuſtaining the laws of the material ſyſtem, in ſupporting this earth in its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious revolutions, ſeaſons and productions? much more in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the moral ſyſtem. Is it manifeſted in keeping the brutal tribes in ſubjection to the laws of their nature? much more in keeping angels and men ſubject to the laws of theirs, or even in taking the wiſeſt and fitteſt meaſures for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; better, infinitely better, I had almoſt ſaid, that ten thouſand material ſyſtems ſhould periſh, than that the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the moral ſyſtem ſhould ſlide and give way, or God's moral government over angels and men ſhould fail, and on ſuppoſition of the penalty not being executed in caſe of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, it muſt totally fail; the divine law muſt be totally vacated; the precept is violated by the creature, and the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſet aſide by the creator, and thus there is an end of all law; moral government is no more; the divine adminiſtration is at an end. And let men, if they can, invent any other way to ſuſtain this government, than the one pointed out, that is, any other ſuited to the nature of angels and men. The voice of reaſon proclaims aloud its propriety and fitneſs, and revelation aſſures us, this is the very way invented by infinite wiſdom and goodneſs, and eſtabliſhed by divine authority.</p>
            <p>There is a moral fitneſs in things, from which the deity can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not depart, from which it would be imperfection in him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. Shall angels and men, intelligent, free and moral agents; be governed in the ſame manner as brutes or inanimate matter? it cannot be. Thoſe then who would exalt the divine mercy to ſuch in pitch, as to let ſin paſs without any adequate puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:020203_0008_0FAE3C76F07238C0"/>
or in other words ſet aſide the penalty of the law; would exalt or rather debaſe it ſo as to repeal all the laws of heaven. Mercy would overturn juſtice, overthrow the divine govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, proſtrate in the duſt Jehovah's throne; diſſolve the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of all moral duty; fully the character of the ſupreme magiſtrate of heaven and earth; and overwhelm the whole ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creation with ſin, anarchy, death and ruin. It would (horribile dictu) extinguiſh all intelligence, God, angels and men! there is no other alternative but one, and that is to make angels and men brutes or inanimate matter: or to ſay that there never ſhould have been in the ſcale of being ſuch creatures as angels and men. How tremenduous is the impiety of men, which not only ſpreads diſorder, confuſion and ruin among the works of God: but thus aſſaults the throne of the omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent himſelf!</p>
            <p>This world is therefore full of the goodneſs of the Lord. It is true it lies in wickedneſs and is full of ſin. But this does not impair or diminiſh the divine goodneſs. But God manifeſts his goodneſs like himſelf, or in a manner worthy of his divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. He is good, not only as a Creator and preſerver, but alſo as a moral governor. The judge of all the earth will do right. He manifeſts his goodneſs in a manner adapted to the ſinful and rebellious ſtate of the world; in ſuſtaining the majeſty of his government, the obligation of his law, the glory of his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the whole moral ſyſtem; by the execution of the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He will never abdicate nor overturn his own government; nor give his conſent to man's ſin and rebellion. It cannot be. He is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity and cannot look on ſin. The wages of ſin is death. He will aſſert his own ſovereignty and dominion; we ſee him ſometimes taking the work of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance into his own hand, and by the flood deſtroying the world of the ungodly; by famine, by peſtilence and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes; laying waſte nations, kingdoms and cities. It is true, there is not an equal diſtribution of rewards and puniſhments in this life. We apprehend the truth on this ſubject to be, that there is ſo much of this diſtribution, as clearly to evince there is a God who judgeth in the earth. But at the ſame time ſo much of an inequality in it, as to give full force to the argument, that there muſt be a future ſtate of retribution; when every work will be brought into judgment, and every ſecret thing; and when God will render to every man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his works. The myſtery of providence will then be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:020203_0009_0FAE3C796DA2F008"/>
all apparent diſorders in the divine government recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and all inequalities made equal. So that light ſprings from this dark cloud, and the infinite wiſdom of God ſhines in the midſt of this obſcurity. For were the diſtribution of rewards and puniſhments here, leſs equal, we would not ſo clearly ſee the footſteps of the divine majeſty in his government of the world. Were it more ſo; we ſhould want a ſtrong irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable argument from reaſon, for the doctrine of a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments. God in innumerable inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhews in this life, that he is not an idle and careleſs ſpectator of the wickedneſs of men. This he manifeſts in adapting the diſpenſations of his providence to the moral character of nations, by granting proſperity to the virtuous, and having always a rod of correction or deſtruction ready for thoſe who far exceed in wickedneſs. And the ſame remark may often be made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting individuals; he makes atrocious vices as certainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume their authors, as fire does the ſtubble. This is wonderfully verified, in the frequent detection of the unnatural crime of murder; and bringing the perpetrator to condign puniſhment even in this life, by a chain of providences which the wiſdom of man had no hand in forming, and of which the criminal had neither the ſmalleſt foreſight nor fear. But yet it cannot be denied, that irreligion and vice in a certain degree, are many times proſperous and on ſome occaſions triumphant; while religion and virtue are oppreſſed and borne down. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of reaſon is, that to finiſh the plan of the divine govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and fully diſplay the juſtice and goodneſs of the divine character; there muſt be a future ſtate of rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Thus far reaſon goes without halting, and while it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily draws this concluſion, it is beautiful to obſerve the coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of revelation: its voice confirms it, for God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by that man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given aſſurance to all men, in that he hath raiſed him from the dead.</p>
            <p>It may be objected to this reaſoning, that the execution of the penalty annexed to human laws is not always neceſſary to the ſuſtentation of government among men. Very true; but in general it is neceſſary, and takes place; and were any magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate generally to neglect the execution of it, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of mercy; we ſhould ſay he was very weak, very wicked, cruel and unjuſt. Mercy to criminals would be cruelty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:020203_0010_0FAE3C79920E5080"/>
to the community at large. But there is an unavoidable imperfection in all human affairs; human governments cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly partake of this imperfection; their laws are imperfect; their penalties inadequate; and their adminiſtrations defective. Sometimes government is too feeble to bring ſome bold and powerful malefactor to juſtice. Sometimes men ſee fit to remit the penalty to one, in order to detect and bring to puniſhment a greater number. Sometimes only the leaders are capitally puniſhed; becauſe it is ſuppoſed that thoſe who were inſnared by them, were deceived, and therefore not ſo guilty. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it would weaken a ſtate too much, were it to puniſh all the offenders. This however we may affirm, that wherever we ſee governments remitting the penalty of a law, it muſt be owing to ſome imperfection or other in the law, the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the government, or the character of the governors. For were we to form an idea of a government abſolutely perfect, it would be one which ſtated a perfect ratio between crimes and puniſhments; and in no caſe whatſoever failed to execute the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty. It is abſurd therefore to argue from imperfect govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments among men, to the perfect government of God. His government is like himſelf, infinitely perfect. There can be no defect in his laws, no weakneſs in his character, no imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in his adminiſtration, and accordingly we ſee, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning mercy revealed in the goſpel, is granted only on the ground of a full and complete atonement, made by Jeſus Chriſt as the ſinners ſurety. The penalty had its full effect on him, and thus all the purpoſes of maintaining the authority of the divine law, ſuſtaining the majeſty of government, and aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dignity of the divine character, are fully anſwered in the caſe of thoſe who accept of that atonement; while mercy, infinite mercy reigns in their ſalvation; becauſe their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal characters are as wicked, as vile, and fall as far ſhort of what the law demands, as if no atonement had been made at all; or as if they had been ſaved without a regard to any.</p>
            <p>But were we even to allow ourſelves to reaſon from imperfect governments among men, to the abſolutely perfect government of God, it would afford but ſmall ground of hope; for it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident that even according to the courſe of human goverments, but a very few could be pardoned, and it would be totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, who theſe ſhould be. To talk of repentance as intitling to pardon, is nonſenſe; for this is far from being the caſe, even in the weak imperfect and feeble governments among men. Beſides, if repentance in one, intitle to pardon, certainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:020203_0011_0FAE3C7AED53CA50"/>
in all will do the ſame, otherwiſe God would be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial and unjuſt. And as no doubt the criminal, when he ſees the miſery to which he hath reduced himſelf, will from a principle of ſelf-love regret his folly; this would infer the neceſſity of remitting the penalty to all, and ſo put an end to the divine law and government. And on this ſuppoſition, the divine law would have no penalty, but repentance, which would make the divine government more imperfect than any among men, convert the penalty into a bleſſing and rather encourage to ſin than deter from it. But we ſee that men under the divine adminiſtration may repent, and yet periſh. Judas repented, and yet plunged into abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute deſpair. Indeed the goſpel repreſents faith and repentance as neceſſarily, connected with an intereſt in Chriſt's atonement; and in this connection alone they are available to pardon and ſalvation. We do not here ſpeak of God's remitting temporal puniſhments in the preſent ſtate; which ſtate is preparatory and in ſome ſenſe probationary for the grand aſſize, the final judgment. As he regards any degree of moral virtue and good order a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, and conſequently any degree of repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; he may for a time remit the temporal puniſhment, and give them longer time. Thus he ſpared Nineveh when pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitent. One grand deſign of the divine diſpenſations in this ſtate, is to prepare the world for the day of judgment and final retribution, that the wicked may be inexcuſable at that day. But not one inſtance in all the book of God can be produced, which will prove, that repentance alone will avail at that awful day. See Proverbs, chap. I. 24—33.</p>
            <p>On this ſcheme of reaſoning, we ſee the neceſſity of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice and atonement of Jeſus Chriſt. If mercy be manifeſted to the ſinner, let it be honourable mercy, comporting with the glory of the divine character, his ſpotleſs holineſs and perfect juſtice: mercy conſiſtent with the honour of his law, the ſupport of his government and the good of the rational and moral world. Not ſuch mercy as would annihilate all government, overturn all juſtice, repeal every moral precept, ſubvert all order and equity, put a final period to the moral ſyſtem, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne God, deſtroy angels and men, and convert the whole intelligent and rational creation into a maſs of ſin, iniquity and ruin.</p>
            <p>The authors and abettors of the doctrine of univerſal ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, would do well ſolemnly to ponder theſe things, leaſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pretext of exalting the divine mercy, they be found
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:020203_0012_0FAE3C7AF656EF38"/>
pleading wickedly for God and talking deceitfully for him. There have appeared two ſchemes of that doctrine; one is, that there will be no puniſhment at all in a future ſtate; the other allows that there will; but maintains that the wicked ſhall be all purified in hell, and after paſſing through, perhaps, many ſtates of torment, ſhall all finally, ſome ſooner, ſome later, eſcape to glory and felicity. The two ſchemes are not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially different; they differ only as to the time of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The firſt is diametrically oppoſite to the principles of the divine government ſtated above. It ſubverts the principles of natural religion and moral government. In effect denies a day of judgment, and a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments; goes on the falſe hypotheſis that there is an equal diſtribution of theſe in the preſent ſtate, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the divine government to ſink under the charge of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and injuſtice; contradicts every doctrine and every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the bible relative to the ſubject. It is the doctrine of ſadducees, epicureans, ſceptics, deiſts, atheiſts; bears the moſt malignant aſpect towards the order, purity and peace of civil ſociety, while it is manifeſt, that it can be of no ſervice to men, either in this life or that which is to come; for were it true, thoſe who deny it, are in no danger; but if falſe, as moſt certainly it is, how dreadfully pernicious! In ſhort it is ſuch a chaos of abſurdity, impiety and nonſenſe, that it is truly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhing any rational creature ſhould be involved in a moments doubt about it. The ſecond ſcheme is at firſt appearance more plauſible, and therefore likely to have a wider range. We ſhall therefore make a few ſtrictures on it. They begin with telling us, that the Hebrew and Greek words tranſlated <hi>eternal, everlaſting,</hi> and, <hi>for ever and ever,</hi> are ſometimes applied to a limited duration, and ſignify in many inſtances no more than a long period; and therefore when applied to hell torments muſt mean no more. This would be fine reaſoning. In ſome caſes they ſignify no more; therefore they can ſignify no more in this caſe. In ſome caſes it is extremely wicked to take away a man's life; therefore it is extremely wicked to do ſo in the caſe of lawful war; or in purſuance of a juſt ſentence of a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial court. The authors of the ſcheme cannot deny, that theſe words ſometimes point out a proper eternity or endleſs duration; becauſe the ſame words are uſed to expreſs the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and perfections of the deity. They cannot be ignorant that in all languages words are uſed both in a proper and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative ſenſe. When we hear the everlaſting hills mentioned,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020203_0013_0FAE3C7BAE4E5AD8"/>
common ſenſe teaches, that the phraſe is figurative. When an Engliſhman ſays, I am infinitely or eternally obliged to you; every body knows he ſpeaks figuratively and uſes theſe words in an improper ſenſe. What is the true, proper and ſtrict mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the words, <hi>everlaſting, eternal,</hi> and <hi>for ever and ever?</hi> Is it not an endleſs duration? If this then be their proper mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how will they prove that they are uſed in a figurative and not in their proper ſenſe, when applied to hell torments? But they will ſay we cannot prove, that when ſo applied, the words muſt mean an endleſs duration. This however we will attempt. There is no way to determine when they are uſed figuratively or properly; but by attending to the ſubject to which they are applied. If applied to any thing in this world, or in this life, they muſt be uſed figuratively; but when ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to any thing in the other world, or in a future ſtate, they muſt be uſed in their ſtrict proper ſenſe. Now hell torments appertain not to this world, but the next, not to time but to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. There muſt be an eſſential difference between the mode of duration called time, and the mode of duration called eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. This difference we cannot define with certainty, becauſe we are acquainted only with the firſt. An able writer has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted it<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Soame Jenyns,</hi> Eſq. one of the lords of trade in Britain.</note>. We acquire ſays he, the idea of time, by a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of ideas; but ſome have called eternity, a <hi>ſtanding point, an everlaſting Now.</hi> Common ſenſe however teaches, that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity muſt be eſſentially different from time, and therefore if there be any future happineſs or puniſhment at all, they muſt be eternal. The new ſcheme is abſurd in this, that its authors ſuppoſe men ſtill to be in time, after they are departed out of time into eternity; that is they ſuppoſe time to be eternity, and eternity time. It is certain that hell torments never point out a time-puniſhment, but an eternal one.</p>
            <p>The advocates for this dangerous doctrine plead the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and atonement of Jeſus Chriſt as the foundation of their opinion, and if that were embraced and accepted by all men; doubtleſs all men would be ſaved by it. But the goſpel tells us, and facts confirm the truth; that many reject it. The ſame goſpel aſſures us, that if this atonement be rejected, inſtead of being ſaved by it; this rejection will aggravate moſt terribly the condemnation of the rejectors. How ſhall we eſcape if we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect ſo great a ſalvation? if he that deſpiſed Moſes law, died without mercy under two or three witneſſes; of how much ſorer
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:020203_0014_0FAE3C7CA40C2E10"/>
puniſhment, ſuppoſe he ye, ſhall be thought worthy, who hath troden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant an unholy thing, and hath done deſpite to the ſpirit of grace? but the univerſaliſts tell us, theſe and other texts to the ſame purpoſe do not move them. The merit of Chriſt's obedience and death is infinite. He has paid the debt of the whole human race. They owe nothing to God; but God owes every thing to them; happineſs in this world and eternal life in the world to come. God is now the debtor and they the creditors. His full due is paid; yea more, he is enriched by the payment. Their debt was but finite. He has got an infinite reimburſement. Let men live as they liſt; wantonly violate the divine law or ſtudiouſly keep it; it is all one. God has no juſt demands on them. It would be injuſtice in him to find fault; at leaſt the height of injuſtice to puniſh them eternally. Perhaps, ſay ſome, impenitent ſinners may ſuffer a few years in the other world; but an eternity of happineſs muſt follow that period; in compariſon of which eternity, many years or ages of ſuffering will be only as the drop of a bucket compared to the ocean. If it were poſſible to reaſon with men in ſuch a reverie, we might pauſe a moment and aſk: is there any ſuch language in all the book of God? what wealth did God loſe by man's diſobedience? How much poorer did he become? what riches are reſtored to him by Jeſus Chriſt? what profit accrues to the almighty by the ſervice or righteouſneſs of any? can a man be profitable to God as he that is wiſe may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to himſelf? Is it any gain to the almighty that thou art righteous? and is not Jeſus Chriſt himſelf the mighty God and everlaſting Father? any queſtion about wealth, property, debt, or commercial juſtice, is altogether foreign to the purpoſe here.</p>
            <p>It is alſo abſurd to argue, that becauſe Chriſt's merit is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite; therefore it muſt extend to the whole human race; for by the ſame argument it muſt extend to all the devils; and if it be ſaid, God did not ſee it proper to include them in the appointment of Chriſt's death, it may be readily anſwered, this overthrows the argument which is built on the infinite merit of Chriſt, and places it on the divine ſovereignty. And it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ſcriptures aſſert the ſame ſovereignty in the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and acceptance of the death of Chriſt only for thoſe who ſhould accept or embrace it. The truth is, the neceſſity of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite atonement does not ariſe from the number, but nature of ſin. An infinite atonement is as neceſſary to the pardon of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:020203_0015_0FAE3C7D297EB9F8"/>
one ſin, as ten thouſand; and its end may be gained as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely in the one caſe as the other. He that offends in one point is guilty of all, ſays James. Numbers do not vary the nature or kind. Sin is juſtly ſaid to be an infinite evil. See what one ſin in our firſt parents did. It brought ruin on the whole world. It defaced the image of God on man, corrupted his nature, involved him and all his poſterity in a ſad moral neceſſity of ſinning ſtill more and more; which is a part of the curſe as well as penal evil, and is the very thing meant by ſpiritual or moral death, that is, men are wicked becauſe they will not be good, their carnal minds are enmity againſt it; which is no excuſe for ſin, but an aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. It has expoſed the whole human race to innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able miſeries in this life, to death itſelf, and to the pains of hell for ever. And take any one ſin committed by any of all the human race, and ſuppoſe it the firſt ſin in the world; it would produce the ſame effects on him and his poſterity. The firſt ſin of the rebel angels was equally fatal. The connection between ſin and perdition does not ariſe only from the appointment of heaven, but from the nature of the thing. For as the earth, in her diurnal revolution, turning her face from the ſun, is neceſſarily involved in darkneſs; by an equal or greater neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, a ſpirit revolting from God, is involved in darkneſs death and ruin. The end and deſign of the death of Chriſt has been already pointed out, viz. the manifeſtation of the glory of the divine character, the ſuſtaining of his moral government, the honour and obligation of his law, while he pardons ſin. Now this end would be gained effectually in he ſalvation of one ſinner; and Chriſt's atonement would have been neceſſary to the ſalvation of that one.</p>
            <p>Can it be injuſtice in God then, to puniſh eternally thoſe who reject that atonement? far from it. Nay, we may af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, the great judge of heaven and earth Jeſus Chriſt, would do no act of diſtributive or perſonal injuſtice to true believers, were he to caſt them into utter darkneſs and puniſh them for their ſins eternally in hell, his atonement and their faith in it notwithſtanding. The injuſtice in this caſe (if any) would be done to himſelf, in ſubmitting to puniſhment which he did not deſerve. Their ſalvation is not an act of ſtrict diſtributive or perſonal juſtice; but of mere rich ſovereign grace.</p>
            <p>When we ſpeak of the imputation of Chriſt's righteouſneſs to believers, it would be abſurd to underſtand it, as if the act of righteouſneſs were transferred from the ſaviour to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:020203_0016_0FAE3C7DEA6AAC50"/>
ſo as to become the ſinner's perſonal act. Nor is it leſs abſurd to ſay, Chriſt's merit is transferred. Merit and deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit are perſonal qualities, which can never be transferred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally from one to another; they muſt forever adhere to the ſubjects of the one and the other. Riches or wealth may be transferred; but moral good and turpitude cannot ſhift hands ſo. When we ſpeak of the imputation of ſin to Chriſt, it would be abſurd to ſay, the act of ſin or even the turpitude of it, was transferred to Chriſt; or that the ill deſert of it became perſonally his ill deſert. He was the Father's beloved Son, his delight, and deſerved the higheſt glory, even when ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the deepeſt ignominy. And when we affirm the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imputation of ſin and the imputation of righteouſneſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, it cannot mean, that the act of ſin is no more; for what is done cannot be undone; nor is the ill deſert of ſin an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated. Even when they are accounted righteous and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed accordingly, they are perſonally deſerving of hell; and this is what makes free grace conſpicuous in their ſalvation.</p>
            <p>It may be therefore affirmed, that no injuſtice taken in a ſtrict diſtributive ſenſe, would be done to true believers; were they to be caſt for ever into hell. What injuſtice then can be done to unbelievers who reject the atonement; though Chriſt reject them. Do not many of them account it fooliſhneſs? do not they deſpiſe and mock it? have not many of them vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olently perſecuted Chriſt and thoſe who followed him?</p>
            <p>It is to no purpoſe to ſay here, that his goſpel is not preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all men; and therefore multitudes of men cannot ſpurn or reject it; for it is certain, thrice at leaſt, ſalvation through him has been publiſhed to all men. It is incontrovertible that Adam taught it to his poſterity. And again Noah a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of righteouſneſs to his children. We can entertain no ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional doubt of this. How then did they loſe it? through the enmity and oppoſition of their own hearts to it; by their own pride, perfidiouſneſs and baſeneſs. Some great man among them, conſpicuous for his genius and abilities; ſome noted deiſt, ſome Hume, Voltaire, or Herbert, would in the pride of his heart deſpiſe the divine counſels; pronounce them fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and promiſe to ſhew the people a better way. They ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring his genius and boldneſs, would, through the pride of their hearts and wiſhing to reſemble ſuch a Coloſſus as much as poſſible, liſten to him with earneſt attention, and embrace his ſcheme. Some Nimrod or Jeroboam wiſhing to eſtabliſh his tyranny on the ruins of the peoples liberties, would ſtudy to ſink them in ignorance and blind ſubmiſſinn to his will.
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:020203_0017_0FAE3C7EDCAAE5D0"/>
Thus Jeroboam would not permit Iſrael to go up to Jeruſalem to worſhip the true God, leaſt it ſhould alienate their hearts from his government; and this finally ſunk them in ignorance, idolatry and ruin. Again after the reſurrection of Chriſt, the goſpel was publiſhed to all nations. Go, ſays Chriſt to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, into all the world and preach the goſpel to every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. That this was verily done, we have authentic evidence from hiſtory. In Aſia, in Europe, and Africa, famous churches were erected; where now heathen and mahometan darkneſs reigns. How came they to loſe the ineſtimable privilege? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not value it, did not think it worthy of reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The carnal mind is enmity againſt God, and is not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his law, neither indeed can be. There is a ſurpriſing proclivity in the human heart to revolt from God. Facts uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally confirm this, eſpecially the three great apoſtaſies; after Adam, Noah and the apoſtolic age. God cannot and will not force mercies on men.</p>
            <p>It is ridiculous to hear men talking in the form univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts do. Let us look to the great men in our day; do they eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem the goſpel as a privilege worth retaining? are not many of them profeſſed or in part concealed deiſts? do not they make their ſport of the goſpel in converſation and writing? do they not neglect the public ordinances of religion, and account it a mean thing to ſit at Jeſus feet and hear his words? are there not many ſuch in the city of Philadelphia? are they not doing what they can to baniſh the goſpel and with it the chriſtian religion from the land? do not many who pretend to literature, prefer the philoſophy of Greece and Rome to the philoſophy of Jeſus? and the writings of Tacitus, Livy, Homer and Virgil, to the Bible? while many, who profeſs to believe the goſpel, corrupt its principles and diſhonour it in their practice. The goſpel is the butt of the enmity and oppoſition of all men except a few. All things on earth conſpire to prevent its taking root where it is not, and to tear it from the place where it is. It is a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it is not quite baniſhed from the world; and were it not for the divine mercy and power, this would ſoon be the caſe. This ſingular remark may be made concerning the bible, that there is no other book in the world, which all men have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired to render uſeleſs as they have it; which, conſidering the depravity of human nature, is no obſcure proof that it is of God. A very great majority of Chriſtians ſo called, from a principle of pretended reverence for it, think it ought to be ſecreted from the people; the Roman Catholics think it is too
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:020203_0018_0FAE3C8363F8C550"/>
holy to be touched by the profane vulgar. Many who do not eſpouſe that principle, let it lye by neglected in their houſes, while learned deiſts and profane mockers, from age to age, are writing and ſpeaking reproachfully of it. Would not God be juſt in giving up ſuch men to their own hearts luſts, and in allowing them to return to their beloved regions of heathen darkneſs? would it be injuſtice in God to ſwear in his wrath, concerning all the deiſts and neglectors of religion in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia and elſewhere? you ſhall never be permitted again to ſee the bible, nor to obſerve one ſabbath; nor celebrate one ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nor preſent one prayer to me; neither you nor your poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity. Could or would theſe men complain? would they not obtain their hearts wiſh? It is certain many in effect paſs this ſentence againſt themſelves and fix the ſame doom as far as in their power on their poſterity. It is clear, the conduct of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in theſe affairs and indeed of the heads of families in an inferior degree, muſt always involve the fate of their poſterity. The conſequences of their conduct muſt unavoidably deſcend to their children. For inſtance, does the parent of a family prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe no religious worſhip in his houſe; it is more than probable his children will copy after his example; and when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come parents, each of them will ſet the ſame pattern of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity before their children; and theſe again in their turn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore theirs. And thus one irreligious parent begins the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, which widens, deepens, and rolls on like a great river of death; ſpreading deſolation wherever it goes, and never ends, 'till ſwallowed up in the dead ſea of eternal perdition. This ſhould make the primores regni the chiefs of a nation, and heads of families, extremely cautious and circumſpect in ſuch matters; becauſe they reject and forfeit not only for themſelves; but alſo for their poſterity; and it is manifeſt great revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in nations cannot take place eaſily or in one day.</p>
            <p>It may be not improperly added here, that the goſpel has been frequently offered to the Indian tribes in this country. Have they diſcovered a propenſity to accept it? or rather have they not very generally rejected it? and have not deiſts and profane chriſtians hardened them againſt it? We are apt to find fault with divine providence, when the blame lies entirely at our own door. How ſhocking and tremenduous after all this—af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all men, except a few, are thus acting in harmony and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert, to render the goſpel abortive or unſucceſsfull in this world, yea to baniſh it from the world, by the pride, enmity, athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm and other luſts of their own hearts; to hear them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:020203_0019_0FAE3C85C1436CE0"/>
to ſuch benevolence to mankind, as to plead, there muſt be a diſpenſation of the goſpel in hell; and that other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe God would be cruel and unjuſt! Were it really to be ſo, and theſe men retaining the ſame temper there as here, they would deviſe means to render it abortive there too. But ſuch perverſe reaſoning is ſo wicked, that the mind of man cannot conceive it. Language fails to give it utterance. It is a full proof, that the heart of man is deſperately wicked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful above all things. Juſtice, ſtrict and perſonal juſtice then, does not require the ſalvation even of true believers. It would not be injuſtice in Chriſt to caſt them into hell for their ſins and puniſh them eternally. Their ill deſert is not and cannot be taken away; nor is his merit ſo imputed to them as to become their perſonal merit, or to make them perſonally as righteous as he is. This cannot be in the nature of things. But while their ill deſert remains, his merit is ſuſtained in law as the ground or reaſon of their eternal ſalvation. Juſtice, it is true, does not forbid their ſalvation, every obſtacle from that quarter is removed by the atonement and righteouſneſs of Chriſt. It is conſiſtent enough with the glory of God, the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his law and government, to ſave them; but their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is an act of rich grace and mere mercy; and this grace requires it, and God's faithful promiſe ſecures it. Were any thing more neceſſary to be added, we might ſubjoin, that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral or public, not ſtrict diſtributive juſtice, makes their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation neceſſary.</p>
            <p>On what ſhadow of ſound reaſoning then, can it be pleaded, that juſtice, ſtrict juſtice requires the ſalvation of thoſe who deſpiſe Jeſus Chriſt; who reject the councils of God againſt their own ſouls; who trample under foot his precious blood and do deſpite to the ſpirit of grace; who force their way to hell, taking their poſterity with them, againſt goſpel light! goſpel grace and mercy! Juſtice require their ſalvation!! Juſtice in every ſenſe require their damnation. Diſtributive juſtice demands it! public juſtice demands it! ſpurned love, deſpiſed blood, affronted mercy demand it! and the word of God declares it ſhall be infallibly executed.</p>
            <p>The deſign of God the Father, in committing the adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of affairs in this world to Jeſus Chriſt the mediator and his Eternal Son, ſeems to be, that the ſon might ſubdue all things to himſelf, or bring all things which the ſin and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of angels and men had thrown into the greateſt diſorder, back again under the dominion of law and juſtice. This is not
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:020203_0020_0FAE3C86C4F65ED8"/>
obſcurely pointed forth by the Apoſtle, 1 Corinth. 15—24—28. Then cometh the end, when he ſhall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the Father; when he ſhall have put down all rule and all authority and power. For he muſt reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet. The laſt enemy that ſhall be deſtroyed is death. For he hath put all things under his feet, and when all things ſhall be ſubdued unto him, &amp;c. The apoſtle evidently refers unto that notable paſſage in the 110 Pſalm. Sit thou at my right hand, ſays the eternal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to his beloved Son, until I make thine enemies thy foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool; which may be thus paraphraſed, I give unto thee my ſon, all power in heaven and earth, and inveſt thee with the full and abſolute adminiſtration of affairs in my kingdom, until I by thy agency have put all rebellion down, reduced all things back again under the dominion of law and juſtice, or put all mine and thine enemies under thy feet; and then ſhalt thou deliver up the kingdom to me without any thing to hurt or offend in it, every ſuch thing being caſt out.</p>
            <p>It appears to have been a common ſaying among the Jews that the Meſſiah when he cometh will reſtore all things. There are two ways in which Chriſt carries this deſign into execution and will finally accompliſh it. The firſt is by a work of grace on true believers; by which their minds are enlightened in the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt; ſee the infinite evil of ſin, are brought to hate it with a perfect hatred and turn from it with full purpoſe of heart and endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our after new obedience; voluntarily ſubmit themſelves to the infinite mercy of God, as it reigns through the atonement; acquieſce, cordially acquieſce in the divine law as holy, juſt and good both in precept and penalty; become reconciled to God's perfections, God's providence and God's moral government. Perſons of this deſcription ſhall be eternally ſaved. Their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation commences in this life, it begins in their ſaving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to God, in the remiſſion of their ſins, the adoption of their perſons, and acceptance of their feeble imperfect but ſincere ſervices. They are preſerved in Chriſt Jeſus and kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation. Their whole dependence is placed on the grace of God in Chriſt, and to that and that alone they will aſcribe all the glory of it through all eternity. But there is another claſs and a very numerous one too, who know not God nor obey the goſpel of his Son, who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord and the glory of his power.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:020203_0021_0FAE3C86F30FB378"/>
They ſhut their eyes againſt the light here, but will lift them up in hell being in torment; and an impaſſable gulph will be fixed between believers and them. They would not know nor believe, under the adminiſtration of the goſpel, that God infinitely hates ſin and will certainly puniſh it; but will and muſt know it, to their eternal coſt under the miniſtration of wrath. They, by the pride of their hearts, rejected free juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification through the righteouſneſs of Chriſt, ſpurned his love, deſpiſed his blood and did deſpite to his ſpirit of grace. They adhered to the law, truſted to their own righteouſneſs, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured down the ſtream of life and launched into the ocean of eternity on that plank. All their life long they perſiſted in appealing to the law, and to the law they muſt go, and by it be judged at the tribunal of God. Their pretended religion and virtue were put in the Saviour's place, and exalted to his throne to the utter rejection of the goſpel and of law and juſtice likewiſe. Will God acquit ſuch at his bar? will he clear the guilty? will he overthrow his glorious goſpel and his holy law both at once? will he juſtify ſinners as they do themſelves? on account of what? righteouſneſs? no; but wickedneſs. For what greater wickedneſs can be imagined, than to reject the counſels of infinite wiſdom and infinite love? what greater wickedneſs than while they do this, to attempt to anſwer the demands of the law by their own imperfect and polluted frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of imaginary merit? while it is certain they never per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed one duty from proper principles, holy motives, nor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected it to a reaſonable and proper end, the glory of their creator. Chriſt will put ſuch down; will put them under his feet, will caſt them forth into utter darkneſs and eternal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. They will be ſubdued under law and juſtice indeed, but it will be by their ſuffering the penalty and enduring the curſe of the law. Darkneſs and deſpair will encloſe them round. And they will be involved in a dreadful moral neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſinning and ſuffering ſtill more and more, but in ſuch a manner as not any longer to ſpread the infection of ſin, and diſturb the order of the kingdom of peace and righteouſneſs. This moral neceſſity will conſiſt in an unconquerable averſion of the heart from God and enmity againſt him; which is the true ſpiritual idea of ſpiritual or moral death; and this death will eternally have dominion over them.</p>
            <p>It is certainly a part of our authors ſcheme, though they do not ſpeak it out, that there will be a diſpenſation of the goſpel in hell, there the throne of grace will be erected; the mercy-ſeat
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:020203_0022_0FAE3C87B114FCB8"/>
revealed; that men ſhall enter on a ſecond probation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary ſtate after death; and perhaps ſome go through ten or ten thouſand ſuch probations. Is not this altogether vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary? what foundation in God's word for ſuch a notion? the bible ſays <hi>now</hi> is the accepted time, <hi>now</hi> is the day of ſalvation. <hi>To day</hi> if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. If we ſin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more ſacrifice for ſin: but a certain fearfull looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation which ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the adverſaries. for it is impoſſible for thoſe who were once enlightened, and have taſted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and have taſted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come, if they ſhall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance; ſeeing they crucify to themſelves the ſon of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame. Becauſe I have called, and ye refuſed, I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man regarded. But ye have ſet at nought all my counſel, and would none of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; I alſo will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh: When your fear cometh as deſolation, and your deſtruction cometh as a whirlwind; when diſtreſs and anguiſh cometh upon you. Then ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me: for that he hated knowledge, and did not chooſe the fear of the Lord. They would none of my counſel; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed all my reproof. Therefore ſhall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices. For the turning away of the ſimple ſhall ſlay them, and the proſperity of fools ſhall deſtroy them. There is a ſin unto death, ſays John, I do not ſay that ye ſhall pray for it. The apoſtle judged it would be diſpleaſing to God, to pray for ſome men even in this Life. But if the ſcheme of our innovators be true, there is no impropriety in praying for all the damned in hell; that God would ſanctify their torments to their purification; that he would mitigate and ſhorten them as much as poſſible. How ſhocking is error!</p>
            <p>Our authors tell us, that the wicked ſhall be purified in hell and ſo fitted for heaven. Here they acknowledge, that in hell they muſt be in a ſinful and morally deprav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtate, at leaſt for a conſiderable time; that is, until the force of hell-fire purge off their impurity; and alſo, that the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of glory muſt be in a ſtate perfectly holy and pure; and that the impure cannot join the ſociety of the pure and holy, until they be cleanſed and purified. Indeed this is ſo well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:020203_0023_0FAE3C8877AFD430"/>
in ſcripture and ſo conſonant to reaſon, that it could not well be denied. Now here the queſtion is, what ſhall be the efficient cauſe of their purification? who ſhall be the agent in this buſineſs? we can think only of two or three, one or other of which it muſt be; either the ſpirit of God; or hell-fire; or themſelves. The ſcriptures aſcribe ſoul purification en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely and only to the ſpirit of grace. Except a man be born of the ſpirit, ſays Chriſt, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the ſpirit is ſpirit, and that which is born of the fleſh is fleſh. Not by might nor by power but by my ſpirit ſaith the Lord. If any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt he is none of his. If ye through the ſpirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye ſhall live. It is true the operations of the ſpirit in ſoul-purification are compared, to the operation and efficacy of water and fire to cleanſe and purge ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial filth from material ſubjects: but theſe are only emblems; the one referring to baptiſm, which is only an outward ſign of moral purification; as when he ſays except ye be born of the water and of the ſpirit, &amp;c. correſponding with another text, he that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved. In the other emblem, to wit, fire, there is an alluſion to Iſaiah 6—6. Then flew one of the ſeraphims unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar, and he laid it upon my mouth, and ſaid; lo! this hath touched thy lips, &amp;c. accordingly John the baptiſt aſſures the diſciples of the Lord that they ſhould be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt as with fire. This evidently had its accompliſhment, when the holy Spirit deſcended on them at pentecoſt in the ſhape of cloven tongues of fire. By this ſpirit their hearts were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with love and holy zeal, and the miraculous power of ſpeaking all languages was communicated to them. The prophet and they were fitted and qualified, for the execution of their offices, by the ſpirit of Chriſt. By his divine influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they were purified from ſin, animated with love and holy zeal, their tongues tipt with heavenly fire and made like flaming torches to diſpenſe light and warm life through the churches of God. And it is remarkable, that Chriſt when delivering this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe after his reſurrection, drops the emblem of fire, and only ſays, ye ſhall be baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, Acts 1. If then we aſcribe the purification of the damn'd in hell to the agency of the ſpirit of grace; God's gracious preſence muſt be in hell, which would turn hell into heaven; and on this ſuppoſition, that word is
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:020203_0024_0FAE3C8ACB817AF8"/>
not true, depart ye curſed, &amp;c. nor that, they ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the <hi>preſence</hi> of the Lord, &amp;c. 2 Theſ. 1—9. nor that word, my ſpirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man; that prayer is vain, caſt me not away from thy preſence, nor take thy holy ſpirit from me, Pſalm 51. theſe exhortations have no meaning, grieve not the ſpirit, quench not the ſpirit, reſiſt not the ſpirit. It follows, that if God's word be true, we cannot aſcribe the purification of the damned to the ſole agent in ſoul-purification; the ſpirit of grace. Their puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication muſt therefore be aſcribed to the torments of hell alone. But how abſurd the idea! that mere torment or puniſhment will conciliate love to the puniſher. What is ſoul-purification? it is holineſs. What is holineſs? it is conformity to the law of God. What is conformity to the law of God? it is love. For Chriſt ſums up the whole law in theſe two, ſupreme love to God and love to our neighbour as to ourſelves. But it is love that begets love. We love him becauſe he firſt loved us. Mere torment will never beget love. Some raving advocates for the doctrine againſt which we contend, drop in their argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the idea of ſpiritual or moral purification; and ſubſtitute in its place, the purification of body or matter; and tell us that fire and brimſtone conſtitute a fine chymical preparation for this purpoſe. But this drollery and nonſenſe is too profound, to merit a ſerious anſwer. It is certain that devils have not bodies of clay. A ſpirit hath not fleſh and bones as ye ſee me have, ſays Chriſt. Beſides, fire and brimſtone; the lake of fire; are figurative expreſſions, pointing forth the poignancy of the torments of the damned: as on the contrary, the felicity of heaven is pointed out by a throne, a crown, a river of life and a tree of life. The beſt ſcriptural idea of theſe torments, which we can form, is, that they conſiſt in anguiſh, horror, deſpair, rage, enmity and fury. And how theſe torments will trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the ſoul into love is not eaſy to ſee. It is certain that theſe are the torments of ſuch as are made ſignal monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of divine wrath in this life. Here permit me to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a ſtory from my own perſonal knowledge, the truth of which I can avouch by the teſtimony of ſcores of living wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. There lived in the ſtate of New-York, a few years ago, a ſenſible intelligent man, whoſe name it is proper to conceal. He with ſome others, laid a plot to maſſacre a number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, who during the former war between Britain and France, retreated into the ſettlements of the white people, as being
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:020203_0025_0FAE3C8B7785CE60"/>
peaceably diſpoſed towards the colonies. The wicked men did this under the pretext of theſe Indians holding a correſpondence with their brethren at war. He and his club having prepared themſelves with ſtrong drink, for the execution of the infernal project, went in the night and barbarouſly murdered the moſt of the poor ſavages. The blaſting curſe of God viſibly fell upon the perſons or property of the whole bloody band. The man of whom I ſpeak after ſome time took up with a woman of indifferent fame, ſaid he was married to her, and had ſeveral children by her. It was whiſpered among the people, that they were not married. He ſaid they were, and threatened to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute at law any who would affirm the contrary. But the ſuſpicion was ſo ſtrong, that he could not get baptiſm to his children. He told me himſelf, that he then determined to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize them himſelf; and, ſays he, as I felt ſome horror at the thoughts of doing it; I made myſelf drunk for the purpoſe, and went through with it; baptizing them in the name of the Trinity. Then, added he, my trouble was completed. The ſpirit of God entirely forſook me. I have committed the ſin unto death; there is no mercy for me, and I wiſh for none, yea ſays he, I wiſh for none. Soon after he had done the laſt ſhocking deed; he parted from his woman; bound out his children; and he told me, that one day in a fit of raging de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, when reflecting on his coveting earthly things and what that and other luſts had brought him to. He took a parcel of paper money, went and ſtamped it in a ſwamp. But O! the livid horrors which disfigured his countenance! he was ſtrong, healthy, intelligent and a good ſcholar; but ſoon became pale, meagre, haggard, wild in his looks, with his hair briſtling out. He would repeat many terrible words from the bible againſt himſelf, and tell me, hell was his eternal portion. I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to comfort him with the conſolations of the goſpel, preached to him, prayed for him, and exhorted him to pray for himſelf, but in vain! He often attempted to murder himſelf! and frequently, in the moſt ſerious manner, put the queſtion to me, whether it were not better for him to do ſo, and go to hell at once, to know the worſt, than to live in his preſent condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? from which I earneſtly diſſuaded him. He would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times blaſpheme! curſe God! and wiſh he were more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than he! he ſpent his time in whittling ſticks, &amp;c. and would lift up his knife, ſtab it into the mantle piece, and ſay, O! if that wereG—! I once took him aſide and urged him
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:020203_0026_0FAE3C8C414881A8"/>
much to attempt to pray, with long entreaty I prevailed. He fell upon his knees, uttered a few words, ſtarted up in horror, and ſaid, I cannot pray! When the late war began, he inliſted in the troops that went to Canada, Anno 1775. The laſt words he uttered to me when I bid him farewell at parting, were, I wiſh a bullet may pierce through my heart! and he nearly got his wiſh! at the ſiege of Quebec, when the continental ſoldiers had erected breaſt works of ice againſt the wall of Quebec, and the firing began, though he did not belong to the train of artillery, againſt the advice of Capt. M—, a worthy officer who told it to me himſelf, he would go to the breaſt works, where a cannon ball from the city took his head, and ſcattered his brains and blood on the ground. This is a ſpecimen only in this life, of the effects of torment on the human mind. And ſurely we may ſay it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God <note n="*" place="bottom">In the picture of the above mentioned unhappy man the colouring is not to high: on the contrary it does not come up to the life; there are ſeveral facts which I do not chuſe to mention; and the truth of my information can be atteſted by many living witneſſes. Some will ſay, the man was mad or delirious and under ſome bodily indiſpoſition. I believe indeed he was delirious under the inſupportable weight of the wrath of God; mad in much the ſame manner as the damned in hell are, though in a far inferior degree. He was otherwiſe intelligent ſenſible and made a good regular and obedient ſoldier.</note>! If it be ſaid the damned will purify themſelves by their own exertions; it may be anſwered, this is more than any could do in this life, with all the aſſiſtance of the means of grace and common operations of the ſpirit. We are not ſufficient of ourſelves ſays Paul to think any thing as of ourſelve<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The changing of the whole frame and contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our ſpiritual and moral nature, is a greater and more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult work of power, than the creation of the ſun, moon and ſtars. Can any perſon force himſelf to love what by nature he hates? Can the Ethiopean change his colour, or the Leopard his ſpots? no more can they that are accuſtomed to wickedneſs do that which is good. If men in hell can by their own power return to God, they are not ſo far from him there as here; and on this ſuppoſition, there was no neceſſity for the blood of Chriſt, or the miſſion of the ſpirit to bring them to God. Moreover, the word of God teaches, that at the day of judgment the mediatorial ſcheme will be finiſhed, and the mediatorial
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:020203_0027_0FAE3C8CE67A0190"/>
kingdom delivered up to the Father; that God may be all in all; let us compare here, Matth. 13—39, and Matth. 24—14, with 1 Corinth. 15—24. The harveſt is the end of the world; this goſpel of the kingdom ſhall be preached in all the world, for a witneſs unto all nations, and then ſhall the end come. Then cometh the end, when he ſhall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, that God may be all in all. The kingdom to be delivered up muſt be the mediatorial king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; the delivering it up muſt mean his finiſhing the ſcheme of grace; the end, when it ſhall be finiſhed, is the day of judgment; conſequently, if any be ſaved after that, it muſt be by another Saviour than Jeſus Chriſt, and by another redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than his atonement. The unavoidable conſequence is, that the damned muſt make an atonement for their ſins, by their own ſufferings, and on this ſuppoſition, there was no need for the atonement and ſatisfaction of Chriſt at all. For if after a man has ſpent his life in ſin, aggravating his tranſgreſſion all the time, by reſiſting the light, and rejecting Chriſt and his atonement, he can make ſatisfaction for all his ſins, and for the rejection of Chriſt too the greateſt of them all; much more might he have made a ſufficient atonement, by his own ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, if Chriſt had never come at all. It is clear, if Chriſt had never come in the fleſh nor ſuffered, men would never have been guilty of the moſt aggravated ſin they can commit, viz. the rejecting of this gift of God and trampling on his divine blood, and ſo would have had infinitely leſs to ſatisfy for, than they now have, who live and die rejecting him; and if by paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome time in hell, they can ſatisfy for all this aggravated guilt, much more might they, if they had never contracted this laſt and greateſt guilt. Thus, if Chriſt had never come in the fleſh, nor died for ſinners, not only would the ſalvation of all men have been very poſſible; but the ſalvation of many, of all the damn'd at leaſt, would have been much more eaſily attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by their own ſufferings, than it can be in their preſent circumſtances. What neceſſity then for the ſufferings and death of the Son of God? what advantage by it? or rather is not the diſadvantage ariſing from it very great, at leaſt to many, as only aggravating their guilt and doubling their puniſhment. It cannot be ſaid that the Saviour hath procured this by his ſatisfaction, that the ſinners own atonement for all his ſins, that of rejecting him among others might become more eaſy. It is clear there is no ſuch idea held forth in the ſcriptures, but
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:020203_0028_0FAE3C90DAD44940"/>
the contrary is declared in the ſtrongeſt language, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of his atonement will infinitely aggravate the guilt and puniſhment of the rejectors; and on this hypotheſis the mediatorial ſcheme will not be finiſhed, nor the mediatorial kingdom delivered up at the day of judgment, which we are aſſured it will be. Beſides if there be an infinite ſufficiency in the atonement of Chriſt, and if it be available to ſalvation whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther accepted or rejected, why demand any more at all of the ſinner? but if it be ſaid that Chriſt atoned for all our ſins, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that of rejecting him, and that we muſt ſatisfy by our own ſufferings for that; then it will follow that our ſufferings muſt be equally meritorious as the ſufferings of Chriſt, if not more ſo; for ſurely there is more guilt, ingratitude, enmity and baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in ſpurning redeeming blood, and trampling on redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blood, through all our life, than in all our other ſins. By other ſins men reject the authority of God; but by this they not only reject the authority which commands them to believe in his Son, but alſo pour contempt on infinite love and mercy; and the rejection of the ſaviour prevents their ſanctification and is at the bottom of all other ſins; at moſt a little longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in hell would have done the buſineſs, without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation and ſatisfaction of Chriſt. How tremenduous is the precipice of error!</p>
            <p>The truth is, a gift rejected can avail us nothing, unleſs to aggravate our guilt. If Chriſt's atonement be finally rejected we can receive no benefit by it; and this is the uniform lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of God's word. He that believeth ſhall be ſaved: He that believeth not ſhall be damned. Whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life. But the fearful and the unbelieving, and all liars, ſhall have their portion in the lake which burns with fire and brimſtone. Which Chriſt explains thus, depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. But the doctrine we oppoſe gives the lie to all this and repeats the old temptation, ye ſhall not ſurely die. In fine, on this abſurd ſcheme of principles, we may aſk, what meaning in the peculiar doctrines of the goſpel? It ſeems to unhinge the whole. What ſenſe in the doctrine of election? what in the doctrine of regeneration? Except a man be born again he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate; for many I ſay unto you ſhall ſeek to enter and ſhall not be able. What meaning in the doctrine of juſtification by faith in Chriſt? Why does our Lord ſay, except ye repent ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh. What
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:020203_0029_0FAE3C91D27E1D98"/>
ſenſe in the doctrine of the ſin unto death, or the unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſin? What in theſe texts, Bleſſed are the dead who die in the Lord. If ye believe not that I am he ye ſhall die in your ſins. The prophet Daniel ſtates the ſeperation between the righteous and the wicked, Dan. 12—2, And many of them that ſleep in the duſt, ſhall awake, ſome to everlaſting life, and ſome to ſhame and everlaſting contempt. The Prince of prophets confirms his ſervant's declaration, Matth. 25—31—46. When the Son of man ſhall come in his glory, then ſhall he ſit on the throne of his glory, and before him ſhall be gathered all nations; and he ſhall ſeparate them one from another, as a ſhepherd divideth the ſheep from the goats; and he ſhall ſet the ſheep on his right hand and the goats on his left; and he ſhall ſay unto them on his right hand: come ye bleſſed, &amp;c. and to them on the left, depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire, &amp;c. the ſolemn ſeene cloſes with theſe words: and theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment; but the righteous into life eternal. Here is a final ſeparation made; do we ever hear of their coming together again? Here are two parallel lines, and both drawn out into eternity by Jehovah himſelf. Is it poſſible they can ever meet? mathematicians tell us of lines which may eternally approximate and yet never meet; but theſe modern divines tell us of a greater paradox; two lines which never approximate and yet ſhall meet.</p>
            <p>Much more might be ſaid in oppoſition to this dangerous doctrine, but as others have oppoſed it with much good ſenſe and ſtrength of reaſoning; I have thought proper to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute only this mite. I am perſuaded the authors are on ground infinitely dangerous, and they have much need to pauſe and conſider; leaſt while they pretend to exalt the divine mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; they be found attempting to fully Jehovah's character; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturn his throne; ſubvert his moral government; ſtain his holineſs and diſhonour his juſtice. Do not they make the God of truth a liar? the oath of God a nullity? for he has ſworn in his wrath that unbelievers ſhall never enter into his reſt. The God of infinite purity a tolerator of ſin? the God of order the author of confuſion? Nay the ſcheme tends to the annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all moral rectitude in God, angels and men. And as it is infinitely ſoothing and flattering to the luſts and corruptions of men; no queſtion, but its promoters will meet with ſucceſs. Deiſtical principles prevail much already; and this doctrine is calculated to give them greater force and a wider range. For men of ſuch principles will naturally aſk, can theſe preachers believe the bible, when they ſo earneſtly propagate what has
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:020203_0030_0FAE3C9230608580"/>
ſo little countenance from it? yea is ſo oppoſite to it. In fine, the doctrine has had its riſe, it will run its courſe, and muſt have its fall, and none who wiſh the proſperity of the church, need be over much concerned. Hereſies muſt needs come, that thoſe who are approved may be made manifeſt. None of Chriſt's ſheep can be loſt. The church is built on a rock, and the gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it.</p>
            <p>There is one manifeſt defect in the new ſcheme. Its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors are very ſilent about the eternal fate of the fallen angels. They ſay nothing at all about them. But it is evident, that on their principles of benevolence in the deity, and the injuſtice of eternal puniſhment; it would be equally inconſiſtent to damn them to eternal ſufferings: as the wicked among men: yea, more ſo; as they have never been guilty of rejecting a Saviour offered to them. And if men can atone for all <hi>their</hi> aggravated guilt by their own ſufferings, much more may the devils for <hi>theirs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The exiſtence of moral evil under the government of an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely good God is a myſtery; that it does exiſt is unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. But how it came to exiſt is a dark queſtion; doubtleſs it is the conſequence of free agency in rational creatures; and muſt originate in an abuſe of their liberty. But it is manifeſt that God dwells and reigns in the midſt of this thick darkneſs; he ſuſtains the majeſty of his government, notwithſtanding the tendency of ſin to drive it to ruin; this he does by inflicting the penalty of his law on tranſgreſſors. It is certain that in the eternal ſtate, holy angels and the ſpirits of juſt men made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, will ſtill be rational, free and moral agents. They will indeed be unchangeably fixed in a ſtate of perfect holineſs; but in ſuch a manner, as will be conſiſtent with freedom. They will not be fixed as in a froſt. They will be eternally free a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents. But a free agent muſt be governed by motives; which preſent him a free choice. The eternal puniſhments of devils and wicked men may therefore touch ſome wheel and produce ſome effect in the divine government, of which we are not aware. They may tend to give eternal energy to the divine adminiſtration. The glorified may be kept immutably in a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtate, by clear views of the glory of the divine nature; the beauty of holineſs; the inflexibility of divine juſtice diſplayed in the eternal puniſhment of ſin. But indeed this ſubject is too far from our reach. In all this argument, I have ſaid little about the infinite evil of ſin. It is not eaſy to fix the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:020203_0031_0FAE3C92EC32D990"/>
idea of any thing infinite in the finite mind of man, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore reaſoning deduced from it, does not ſtrike with ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction. It is certain however, that ſeveral things afford ground to form this idea of it. It is ſaid, Job 22—5, Is not thy wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs great and thine iniquities infinite? Sin is the rejection of an infinite good, God himſelf. It is rebellion againſt an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſovereign; and were it as powerful as it is ſinful, it would caſt down his throne and annihilate his being and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; for as the ſinner will not regard the authority of the lawgiver, we are ſure he would not ſuffer the penalty, if he could reſiſt, the conſequence is, an end would be put to the divine government. And God muſt hate ſin with an infinite hatred, and muſt manifeſt this hatred in an infinite manner; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly in the room of all the redeemed, an infinite ſurety was appointed, and an infinite atonement exacted. By which atonement, all who accept it, are ſaved with an infinite ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; and therefore reaſon would ſay, thoſe who reject it, muſt periſh with an infinite or everlaſting deſtruction; but on this I do not inſiſt.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude the whole, with a ſhort addreſs to thoſe who have embraced the univerſal ſcheme. I have no hopes of making any impreſſions on the teachers of it. Their pride, their honour, their fame, their intereſt, which are powerful ſprings of action in the human heart, are all combined againſt me; and will probably not ceaſe to operate, until they have finiſhed the ſcene. But poſſibly ſomething may be done with their followers.</p>
            <p>My poor deluded brethren; it behoves you to conſider well the ground on which you ſtand. It is a matter of infinite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to your own ſouls, and the ſouls of others: to your own ſouls; how dreadful to go down to the grave with a lie in your right hand! how terrible to meet God at the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeat in a ſtate of war againſt the truths of his word, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his ſovereignty, his government, his juſtice, mercy, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs truth and holineſs! his law and goſpel both! will you ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to appear at his awful bar, and call him a liar to his face! To the ſouls of others; your principles and conduct muſt in the nature of things ſpread the infection among others, and ſome of you are not a little zealous to propagate the ſcheme.

beſeech you, conſider well, what you are about. What if the blood of your children and of many others, whom you have tempted to make ſhipwreck of faith and a good conſcience, ſhould be required at your hands. It was a ſaying of Luther, the eminent German Reformer, to whoſe exertions in the cauſe of God the whole world is indebted; that ſatan will never be at reſt for the good word's ſake. For a long time, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to deſtroy the church by perſecution; but was fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated in his attempt, for the blood of the ſaints was the ſeed of the church. Now ſince the rights of mankind have been better underſtood, and perſecution has in a great meaſure ceaſed throughout the nations; he endeavours to work the ruin of Chriſt's kingdom by odious and monſtruous errors. We might have argued <hi>a priori</hi> or before it happened, that this would be the caſe. Facts confirm it. He is a maſter in the arts of deception. Has the knowledge of an angel, the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of a devil and the ſkill of a practitioner. What a pity that profeſſors of religion ſhould be deceived through his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilties and devices.</p>
            <p>When I ſee you running after every new projector in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, methinks I behold you greedily ſipping the poiſon of aſps and the venom of dragons. I do not mean by this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark to preclude free inquiry, but there is an infinite differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between free enquiry and ſcepticiſm. You ought not to be like children toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, and cunning craftineſs of men whereby they lye in wait to deceive; ever learning and never coming to the knowledge of the truth. Only think from the inſtance of the poor frantick ſhakers how far a ſpirit of deluſion may carry men! think of the nonſenſe, wherewith the common ſenſe and underſtandings of mankind, were for a conſiderable time abuſed and inſulted by one of the prime promoters of the doctrine; namely that in hell ſin ſhould be puniſhed, but not the ſinner: as if the act could be ſeparated from the agent in this caſe: or as if the law of the ſtate could puniſh murder while the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer eſcaped with impunity. Think of the mad blaſphemous pretenſions of I—m—m—h W—n; and yet ſhe has her followers. An enemy is doing theſe things. Satan is ſowing tares in God's field. Let not a falſe pretence to benovolence, to liberality of ſentiment, a fondneſs for ſingularity and pride of underſtanding, carry you down the ſtream and over the daſhing falls, the rocks and precipices of error and deluſion. Chriſt will never loſe his church; but you may be loſt. Do
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:020203_0033_0FAE3C954426E590"/>
not ſay it is a ſmall matter and of little conſequence what your opinions be in religion, providing your practice be good. It cannot be a matter of indifference whether you think as God thinks; whether the ſame mind be in you, which is in Chriſt Jeſus; whether you have heard and learned of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not; whether you be taught by the ſpirit of God or the ſpirit of error; whether you have communion with God and glorified Spirits and the Saints of God on earth, in the truth; or not; whether you grieve the hearts of God's children or not. You do not yet ſee whither the doctrine leads you. The maſk is not thrown off. You may be under the reſtraint of former and better principles. A regard to the good opinion of thoſe who differ from you; an ardent deſire to advance the ſchemes may make you apparently virtuous and religious. But the doctrine does undoubtedly lead to diſſipation. It ſaps the foundations of religion and morality.</p>
            <p>Its purport is plainly this, let men live as they pleaſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to the divine law or goſpel; they muſt be ſaved: otherwiſe God would be cruel and unjuſt. That is, creatures muſt be totally independent of their creator. All re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to his will, all reſpect to his authority in the law and his grace in the goſpel muſt be drop't and yet they ſaved. Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful worms muſt be as Gods. They wiſh for ſalvation in ſin not from it. But ſalvation is nothing elſe than reducing the rebel back to a cordial ſubordination to the will of God, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning his rebellion, conſiſtently with the honour of the law-giver, obligation of his law and ſupport of his government. And were your doctrine univerſally embraced, it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce fearfull effects on ſociety. The language of men would be; come, let us eat and drink for to-morrow we die. I heartily wiſh you may be recovered from the ſnare of ſatan, AMEN.</p>
            <p>☞ I have given my ſentiments freely upon the ſubject, treated of above, under a deep ſenſe of my inability to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle it as it deſerves. If any will candidly convince me of any error or miſtake, I will thank them, and readily give it up. I have often declared my mind, in detached thoughts from the pulpit, on the ſubject, in New-England and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; and humbly think the miniſters of Chriſt from a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

If any erroneous ſentiment ſhould be found in this performance; I alone am accountable for it; as no man living ſaw the piece before it went to the Preſs. And if it ſhould be acceptable to the church of Chriſt and obtain the dear Redeemer's bleſſing to do any good; I purpoſe a ſecond ſmall piece, in which I will anſwer the objections of the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries of the univerſal doctrine and wreſt from their hands the texts of ſcripture by the perverſion of which they attempt to build up their Babel.</p>

            <head>The connexion ſtated between Civil Government and religion.</head>
            <p>CIVIL magiſtracy is unqueſtionably an ordinance of God. And it is alſo called an ordinance of man; becauſe though God has inſtituted government and order among men: yet he hath left the particular form altogether free to the choice of nations. The inſtitution, without doubt, proceeds from God as the creator and moral governor of the world. Dominion is not founded on grace. Jeſus Chriſt is indeed given to be head over all things for the good of his body the church; and all power is given to him in heaven and earth. But this will not infer, that magiſtracy is an ordinance of Chriſt as media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; or that it proceeds from him in that character; no more than the ſubordination of angels to him as his miniſters; and the ſubjection of the elements to his power, will infer, that theſe were created by him as mediator. Magiſtracy has its foundation not in the grace of the goſpel; but in the law and light of nature. Its end is not the eternal ſalvation of men, but the preſervation of order among them in this world. Its rewards and puniſhments do not extend to the life to come, but are confined to this. Nevertheleſs we believe, that being an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance of God, it muſt bear a relation to him, and ought to be applied to his glory. And civil government being moral go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, it muſt have its foundation in moral ſentiments; which moral ſentiments conſtitute natural religion: and as the chriſtian religion contains all the principles of natural religion and makes many valuable additions to them; though we cannot affirm, that the knowledge of what is peculiar to it, is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the being of civil government, yet it conduces much to its well-being. Civil communities and their rulers, will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore find, that to cultivate moral ſentiments, or promote the practice of virtue, which is founded on the knowledge and fear of God, is eſſentially neceſſary to the preſervation of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment among them. And communities made up altogether, or chiefly, of Chriſtians will find, that the encouragement and promotion of the chriſtian religion, by the body of the people and their rulers, as far as is competent to them even in their civil capacities, will infinitely conduce to their intereſt and advantage in this life, or to the purpoſes of peace, order and good government among them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:020203_0036_0FAE3C9B77582AC8"/>It is natural for erring mortals to run into extremes. While ſome of our worthy anceſtors gave perhaps too much power to the civil magiſtrate about religion; ſome in our days, to ſhun that extreme, ſeem to have run into the oppoſite. They teach, that the magiſtrate as ſuch, has nothing to do with it, and there is the greateſt reaſon to believe, that, what many among us underſtand by liberty of conſcience in religion, is a liberty, ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to diſregard all religion and caſt off all conſcience. This too plainly appears from the practice of many, from the neglect of religion in our civil conſtitutions and laws; and the inattention of magiſtrates to put in force the inadequate and feeble laws which have been enacted againſt irreligion, profanity and vice. But ſurely there muſt be a wide difference between theſe two. Liberty of conſcience ſuppoſes conſcience to exiſt, conſcience of duty both towards God and man. But without a ſenſe of religion and moral excellence, it cannot exiſt; without the knowledge of theſe, we ſhould be as void of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience as the inhabitants of the foreſt. To grant liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience then is one thing, and to purſue ſuch a line of conduct, as tends to annihilate all conſcience, is ſomething very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</p>
            <p>In order to a clear diſcuſſion of this important ſubject, it will be neceſſary to explain the term religion, and then ſtate the queſtion with preciſion. By religion in this queſtion, we mean, a belief of the exiſtence of God, ſome competent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of knowledge of his nature and perfections; of our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire dependence on him; that we muſt be accountable to him for our conduct; a belief of his providence; and that he is the avenger of the wicked and rewarder of the good; that he is eſſentially holy, juſt and good; that if the wicked eſcape the judgment of man, they cannot eſcape the judgment of God; or if they ſhould eſcape his righteous judgment in this life, they will not in the life to come. But a ſecret belief of theſe things will not anſwer the purpoſe, it muſt be viſible to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety in ſome way or other. Therefore there muſt be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion a viſible profeſſion of this belief, a confeſſion of the name of God, a reverence and fear of his divine majeſty, and all this expreſſed in worſhipping him, in that form which is moſt agreeable to the worſhipper's conſcience.</p>
            <p>The queſtion then is not, whether the magiſtrate ought to aſſume the power of managing the internal government of the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:020203_0037_0FAE3C9C75189720"/>
church of Chriſt? or meddle with the internal order of any religious ſociety? This all men will readily grant would be improper. Nor, 2dly is it, whether full liberty as to modes and forms of worſhip, or even principles of doctrine which do not ſap the foundation of good order in civil ſociety ought to be allowed? this is readily granted. Nor, 3dly is it, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the magiſtrate may act in this buſineſs <hi>ex arbitrio,</hi> or by his mere will and pleaſure without the conſent of the ſubjects or a majority of them, forcing on them by his ſole authority, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and the modes of it? It is certain the civil magiſtrate has no legal power to do ſo; and it is equally true, that in this ſenſe, he has no legal power to do any thing. His authority is delegated. He is the ſervant of the public. His authority is derived from the grant, conſent, or previous compact of the people. But the queſtion is, what may the community at large do? what ſtipulations and conditions may they lawfully fix on in their compact with each other and their magiſtrates? may they neglect religion altogether? or may they not provide for the ſecurity and practice thereof? and if they may, is it not the duty of their magiſtrates in the adminiſtration of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſee theſe ſtipulations and conditions fulfilled, or in other words to ſee the laws in favour of religion and virtue executed? we affirm they may and ought ſo to do; and to maintain the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, is to found civil government, not indeed on heatheniſm, the foundation is not ſo good as that; but on abſolute atheiſm. It would place it intirely independent of God.</p>
            <p>The very nature of the civil compact ſhews religion in the ſenſe above defined to be neceſſary to its formation; for with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it men can place no confidence in each other; without it there can be no faith among them. This compact is a ſacred covenant between the members of the community and between the whole community and their magiſtrates, in which they ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly engage to be faithful to each other, to ſubmit to whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome laws agreed on by the whole, and ſupport their magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates in the execution of theſe laws; while their rulers with equal ſolemnity engage to execute them: and though the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant be chiefly about ſecular or temporal intereſts; yet a ſenſe of the obligation to fulfill it muſt ariſe from religion. In ſuch a covenant God is called to witneſs their ſincerity, either explicitly or implicitly; and to be the avenger of ſuch as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſly break it. No doubt the ſtate engages to puniſh the violation of the compact; but whence ariſes the obligation on
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:020203_0038_0FAE3C9CAF5314F0"/>
them to do ſo? and what ground of confidence in them that they will do ſo? ſurely a ſenſe of the authority of God obliging them, is the origin of this. If it be ſaid, that a ſenſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon danger will oblige them. We anſwer a ſenſe of common danger will make a herd of ſwine ſtand in defence of each other. But men are ſuperior in nature to ſwine, and muſt be governed by higher motives; beſides, previouſly to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial compact, the members might have kept themſelves free, or in a ſtate of nature; and after it is formed they may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to that ſtate, on occaſion of every little difficulty, or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined ſeverity; unleſs they have ſome ſenſe of the obligation of their plighted faith in the compact, which ſenſe muſt origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in the knowledge and fear of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I argue the point from the nature of man. Man is a rational, a free and moral agent. There is a kind of ſociety among many of the brutal tribes. Herds of ſheep and oxen run into ſociety, his they do merely by a blind inſtinct. God ſees meet to govern and rule them in that manner and it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to their nature; but man is poſſeſſed of a higher na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He is a rational and voluntary agent. A ſociety of men then ought not to be formed on the ſame principles as a ſociety of brutes, not from a principle of blind inſtinct, nor merely from a ſenſe of common danger, but from a perception of the authority of God, a diſcernment of the divine inſtitution, and a regard to the honour and glory of God and the good of mankind. A rational and moral agent muſt be actuated by motives, and theſe motives muſt be rational or adapted to the dignity of his nature: and to move him to form ſociety and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the duties of the ſocial union; no motives are truly ſo; but thoſe above mentioned; all which neceſſarily involves the knowledge fear and worſhip of God. Some moral philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have called man a religious animal, and tell us this is his principal diſtinction from the brutal tribes and chief ſuperiority above them. Muſt they not then proceed ignorantly and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly, who would propoſe to form or preſerve a ſociety of theſe creatures, without any regard to religion. Suppoſing a number of men, accidentally meeting on an uninhabited iſland, and about to form themſelves into a body politic; they neceſſarily behoved to fix on ſome religious and moral principles, as the baſis of the ſocial union among them; for without this, as has been ſaid in the former argument, there could be no faith among them, no truſt or confidence in each other. If religious and moral prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:020203_0039_0FAE3C9D70084F78"/>
be neceſſary to the formation of ſociety, they are equally neceſſary to its preſervation, and without a ſteady regard to them no ſociety can ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The affirmative of the queſtion may be argued from the nature of civil government. Civil government is certainly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral government, and by it God carries on his moral govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the world. The rule of this government is the moral law or the law of God; for let men diverſify their laws as they pleaſe, they muſt coincide with the divine law. They cannot contradict it without contradicting the eternal and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable principles of equity and juſtice. The variety of laws among men calculated for the good of ſociety (and they have no moral power to make any other) is no more than the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the divine law to the infinite variety of circumſtances in ſociety. The authority which obliges to obedience, does not originate only in the conſent or compact of ſociety, but in a ſource infinitely higher, the will of the ſupreme governor. God who created man a rational and moral agent, under the obligation of his laws, alſo formed him a ſocial being. He made him with a ſtrong propenſity to ſociety, and mutual wants and neceſſities ſtrenghten this principle, and urge men into ſociety. One of the ſtrongeſt propenſities in human nature, the inclination of the two ſexes to each other, is the firſt attracting power, and lays the foundation of the ſocial union. But men are bound to yield to this propenſity, not by blind inſtinct as the brutes; but by a moral obligation, the authority of God: and to perform the duties reſulting from that relation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all the other duties of the ſocial union, by the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. He who gave laws to men as individuals, alſo gave laws to ſocieties of men. And indeed it is only in a ſtate of ſociety, that the chief part of the divine law can have practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally any place, or that there can be any ſcope for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of what it requires.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We argue the point from the character given to civil rulers. They are not mere creatures of the ſtate, but miniſters of God for good, as the apoſtle calls them. Civil rulers are improperly ſtiled legiſlators or lawgivers. The ſupreme God is the law-giver to men. And they are but miniſters of his law: and muſt be accountable to him for their conduct; he is king of kings and Lord of Lords. Daniel ſays to Belſhazzar, the God in whoſe hand is thy breath, and whoſe are all thy ways, that is, to whom thou muſt be accountable for them all, haſt thou
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:020203_0040_0FAE3C9E31BD3EF0"/>
not glorified. He that ruleth over men muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of God. None can deny, that all the duties of the civil or ſocial union are moral duties, which affect the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and oblige it. But who has a right to rule the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? not any civil ſtate, but God only. Who is the Lord of conſcience not the ſtate but God. If the laws of a ſtate ſhould in any inſtance contradict the laws of God they have no moral obligation; no man is bound to obey for conſcience ſake. But it is an unſpeakable mercy, that the precepts of moral duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man, are generally ſo clear, and every man has got ſuch a legible copy of them on his heart; that ſtates in a general way will not, if honeſtly aiming at truth and equity, go far wrong in the application of them. At any rate if civil rulers pretend to rule rational and conſcientious beings, if they would act in a higher character, than herdmen ruling over ſo many cattle. All that they can in reaſon pretend to; is to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter and apply the divine law; and act as miniſters under God the ſupreme Lord of conſcience. And to place civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment independent of God and religion; is either to diveſt men of reaſon and conſcience, and ſo make them brutes: or it is to make the ſtate, or magiſtrate of the ſtate, the Lord of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; and the law of the ſtate the only rule of conſcience.</p>
            <p n="5">5. We argue it from the neceſſity and uſe of oaths in civil ſociety. It is manifeſt that when men enter into compact with and ſwear to be faithful to each other. It is by the name of God they ſwear. Thus princes bind themſelves to their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and ſubjects to their princes. We cannot have a marriage; nor a governor; a barriſter; a juryman; nor a witneſs in a court; without a ſolemn appeal to the deity. An oath is for confirmation and puts an end to all ſtrife. It is abſurd to ſay, that this is only an artificial mode of forming and ſuſtaining ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety invented by men; and that the only object of terror is the puniſhment appointed by the ſtate to the crime of perjury; for on that ſuppoſition, it would anſwer the purpoſe as well, to ſwear the witneſſes by the judge's little finger; only take care to puniſh perjury when detected. Poor blind mortals that we are<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We depend on God in every ſenſe and do not ſee it in any. His ſacred and adorable name has been in all ages, and ever well be the grand pillar to ſupport civil ſociety. But unleſs religion or the knowledge, fear and worſhip of God be promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the citizens, it is abſurd to ſwear them by his name. The fear of God will be a more powerful reſtraint from crimes
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:020203_0041_0FAE3C9F231D9FC0"/>
than all the terrors of gaols and gibbets; and without ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of a religious fear of the deity, in vain ſhould we hold out to men theſe terrors; it merits our attention here, that this ſolemn appeal to the deity in an oath is univerſal and perpetual as human nature itſelf; which is no obſcure hint that our argument is founded on the common ſenſe of mankind.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If the magiſtrate as ſuch have no concern with religion, then it follows that the ſubjects or citizens as ſuch have as little. And thus in idea at leaſt, we have a ſociety of rational and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral agents, more dangerous than the moſt furious beaſts of prey. Their reaſon without the controul of religion only makes them capable of greater miſchief. And on this plan, we ſee a moral relation ſubſiſting among moral agents, without any regard to a moral law, or to God the giver of that law: This is atheiſm and abſurdity with a witneſs. And we may venture to affirm that no ſociety of men ever could be formed on theſe principles: or if formed, it could not ſubſiſt for one day. But let men in their ſpeculations err as they pleaſe, God hath fixed boundaries to human nature over which it cannot paſs. And we may aſſert there never was and never will be a ſociety of men alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in ſuch a ſtate; though by erroneous views of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and men's inattention to religion in civil ſociety; great damage may be done, and we may be reduced to the loweſt or nearly the loweſt degree of conſiſtency and order in the ſocial ſtate. In a word religion and virtue form the very baſis of good government. The knowledge, fear and worſhip of God are neceſſary to the very being and conſervation of civil ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
            <p n="7">7. This truth may be argued from the very deſign of civil government, which is to prevent or puniſh theſe mal-practices, that tend to overthrow the order; ſubvert the ſtability and peace; and ſo work the diſſolution of civil ſociety. That this is the deſign of the inſtitution and erection of civil government, is ſelf evident. But the difficulty is to inveſtigate and aſcertain the true extent of the power which ought to be veſted in civil rulers for this purpoſe. The propoſition divides itſelf into two branches, the firſt is to prevent, the ſecond is to puniſh crimes. It is much ſafer and wiſer to prevent crimes, if poſſible, than to puniſh them. Puniſhments eſpecially by death muſt be always diſagreeable to humane rulers; and though ſometimes neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ought never to be executed with a vindictive ſpirit, but only in terrorem; or to prevent a repetition of the crime by
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:020203_0042_0FAE3C9FA9DB1E50"/>
the offender himſelf or by others. And thus the laſt branch of the office of rulers namely puniſhing, finally reverts into the firſt; which ſerves to ſhew in the cleareſt manner that to prevent crimes, is the grand deſign of civil government. The work of puniſhing is the laſt, moſt unſucceſsful and diſagreeable expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. If no previous pains be taken for this purpoſe; but the whole reſted on puniſhments; the work will grow on the hands of rulers. The more they puniſh the more they will find to do; until the ſtate like a rotten houſe, fall on its maſters and cruſh them in its ruins. Thoſe then who think that the ſole deſign of civil government, is to puniſh, goad and compell men like beaſts of burden, are greatly miſtaken. The chief deſign of the inſtitution, is to form the manners of the people to virtue and every ſpecies of moral goodneſs. They who rigorouſly puniſh, but take no previous pains to prevent crimes; may be aptly compared to thoſe harſh and tyrannical pedagogues, who uſe no diligence to lead their pupils on to knowledge; but ſeverely chaſtiſe them when found deficient, or not ſo wiſe as they ought to be.</p>
            <p>But by what means ſhall crimes be prevented? the queſtion is truly important. In order to it, it is neceſſary to ſtrengthen the internal bonds of the ſocial union; or in other words the ſprings of virtue and true goodneſs. All theſe may be ſummed up in two. At leaſt I know not any but will fall under the one or the other. Whatever external bonds may be deviſed and framed by men to hold ſociety together; the internal are ſocial love and conſcience. With theſe men are fitted by the all-wiſe creator, both to form and conſerve human ſociety. Take one or both away, and there can be no more coherence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong mankind, than among ſcattered atoms driven with a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious wind. We ſhall conſider them in order, and firſt for ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial love. By what means ſhall it be diffuſed through the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the people? there is but one way to do this, and that is to promote the knowledge, fear and worſhip of God. God muſt be made known to them, as the common parent, friend and benefactor of all men; as the author of all our bleſſings, which he pours out with a profuſe and liberal hand. They muſt hence learn to view their fellow creatures as children of the ſame family; under the care of the ſame indulgent father, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to the ſame righteous judge. That perſonal intereſt conſiſts in promoting that of the public; that the happineſs of each individual is comprehended in the good of the whole. In
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:020203_0043_0FAE3CA48736F450"/>
a word, that true ſelf-love and ſocial are the ſame. The Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion is admirably calculated to ſtrengthen benevolence and promote brotherly love. The doctrine that God ſo loved the world as to give his only begotten Son, that whoſoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in him ſhould not periſh, &amp;c. That the Son voluntarily laid down his life to redeem us to God, and the commandment of this beloved Saviour, that men love one another, enforced with this cogent argument, his infinite love to them, if properly repreſented and urged, might produce glorious conſequences. This divine benevolence, if deeply rooted in the heart, would lead ſpontaneouſly to all the duties, which we owe to our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. A ſacred authority aſſures us that love is the fulfilling of the law, and can work nothing but good to our neighbour, and we muſt ſuppoſe the laws of every ſtate to be calculated for the good of mankind, and howſoever diverſified, if founded on the immutable principles of virtue, muſt be correſpondent to and coincident with the divine law; and therefore this divine principle would lead to the obſervation of the laws of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>The ſecond bond of the ſocial union, which civil rulers ought carefully to ſtrengthen in order to prevent crimes, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Conſcience is juſt the voice of God in the ſoul; and may be defined, a man's own judgment on his intentions and actions; in conſequence of examining them by the divine law, acquitting or condemning himſelf as theſe agree or diſagree with ſaid law. This is a powerful bond of ſociety. Were it not for this there would be no government among men at all. God in mercy to men has implanted more or leſs of it in every breaſt. And God alone is the Lord of conſcience and not any civil ſtate; conſequently the divine law is the rule of conſcience; and the laws of the ſtate only in ſo far as they are agreeable to it. It is evident that the moral ſenſe or conſcience will admit of various degrees. Indeed, through ignorance of God and his law, and a habitual courſe of wickedneſs, men may loſe much if not every degree of it.</p>
            <p>A perception of good and evil, of moral beauty and deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; of praiſe and blame may be almoſt totally eradicated from their minds. A ſacred authority aſſures us, that ſome men have their conſciences feared as with a hot iron, and are paſt feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: yea may arrive at that dreadful ſtate as to glory in their ſhame, and be aſhamed of their glory; and thouſands in our country are advanced ſo far already. It is incumbent then on civil rulers, to uſe every mean in their power, to give vigour
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:020203_0044_0FAE3CA5B72AF878"/>
and elaſticity to conſcience. This can be done only by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the knowledge of the divine law, the rule of conſcience, and of Jehovah the Lord of conſcience; which brings us exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the ſame ground, where the former point placed us; and ſhews in the cleareſt manner, that all good government is certainly founded on the knowledge, fear and worſhip of God; the knowledge of his law, his ſacred authority, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But another queſtion occurs here, how ſhall civil rulers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the knowledge, fear and worſhip of God? Their own example is a great deal. Let them ſeek after the knowledge of God and his Son Jeſus Chriſt the Saviour; let them fear and reverence his holy name; let them practiſe his worſhip both public and private, and particularly be careful to ſanctify the holy ſabbath. The obſervation of a ſabbath for religious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, or ſetting apart, a portion of our time for acquiring the knowledge of God and worſhipping him, is a plain dictate of the law of nature. The heathen nations all practiſed it, though ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularly and devoted much more of their time to religious exerciſes ſuch as they were, than God requires of us, which is only the ſeventh part; and without a ſabbath, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, fear and worſhip of God would inevitably periſh from among men. Irreligious rulers may pretend to be friends to their country; but they are the very plagues of it: while by the exerciſe of power they think to build up the ſocial fabric: by their practice they ſap its deepeſt foundations. Like fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh phyſicians, while they pretend to heal wounds, cure diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers incident to the body, and without pity lop off mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; they corrupt and poiſon the juices, and tear aſunder the ligaments and joints. We have ſhewed already, that the grand deſign of civil government is not merely to puniſh crimes when committed, but to prevent them by forming the manners of the people to virtue and goodneſs. But how will this work in the hands of profane rulers? Men in exalted ſtations muſt have an amazing influence on the lower claſſes; if the pattern they ſet be good, they may do much good; if bad, much, very much evil. Blind and infatuated men! who think they can uphold ſociety by their own ſhort-ſighted policy and harſh power, while by example they are undermining its foundations. The laws of the ſtate ſentence poor wretches to the gibbet; but perhaps in very many inſtances it will be found that ſome of the men who enacted the laws, or execute them, may have been the occaſion, by their infidelity in principle and profanity in prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, of bringing them there.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:020203_0045_0FAE3CA67A37F9F8"/>It is a work highly worthy of virtuous rulers, and will co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate with their good example to gain the end propoſed, by proper laws to fix and encourage a ſufficient number of ſchoole, and other ſeminaries of learning, throughout the country; and particular attention ſhould be paid to the character of the teachers, and proviſion made that the pupils be taught not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the arts and ſciences, but the principles of religion and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. But above all, they ſhould encourage the ſpreading of the goſpel of peace. There is no neceſſity for, no propriety in granting a civil eſtabliſhment to any one denomination of Chriſtians, even the pureſt. But without this, laws might be framed, that would greatly tend to ſpread the goſpel and with it true and undefiled religion. Whatever men may think, who do not allow themſelves to think deeply or frequently on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; the goſpel is the great river of life, which, if it had free courſe through the nations, would certainly in a high degree purify them; it is the tree of life, which bears twelve manner of fruits, and bears them every month, and the leaves thereof are for the healing of the nations. What a pity to ſit on the banks of this river and refuſe its waters! to ſit under the ſhadow of this tree and reject its fruits! Finally they ſhould let all men know, that they ought to profeſs; and it is expected of them, that they will profeſs; yea and muſt profeſs ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. That we look on a man who profeſſes no religion, as a wild beaſt; as the worſt of all wild beaſts; that his reaſon only makes him capable of greater miſchief than his brethren in the deſert. That we are ſure, he is not bound in conſcience, to diſown and deny God; blaſpheme his name; profane his ſabbath, &amp;c. That he might with equal reaſon pretend he is bound in conſcience to commit robbery, theft, burglary. There is nothing more natural to the human mind than religion in ſome form or other; and yet there is nothing to which the heart of man is ſo much oppoſed as to the true religion; and it is no doubt a collateral proof of Chriſtianity being truly of God; that no wicked man can love it in its native ſimplicity. But this is conſiſtent enough with our firſt poſition, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of ſome kind or other is natural to the human heart. He then muſt act a moſt unnatural part who profeſſes no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in any form. All nations worſhip ſome deity; and all men in the day of calamity and death will ſeek to their God. It is adverſity, and eſpecially death approaching, that gives the heart a free vibration. Proſperity debauches it, incarcerates it, deceives it. It is only in proſperity, that men can think
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:020203_0046_0FAE3CA726CBB3A0"/>
and act as if they were independent of God. But alas! it is only when enjoying ſome degree of proſperity, health at leaſt; that they are capable of any ſocial duties; and thus ſociety gets their ſervice, only when diveſted in ſome degree of cool recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. When we ſee men utterly diſregarding God and pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing contempt on his infinite majeſty; it is natural to aſk: can that man who makes no conſcience of his duty to his maker, make any of his duty to his neighbour? will he not injure me if he can with a proſpect of advantage, and hopes of impunity? when we hear a man wantonly profaning the name of God. We aſk, how can any court admit his oath in evidence? will he in that caſe venerate the name of God which he daily treats with the moſt wanton contempt, and perhaps only to give vent to his cruel diabolical paſſions. And ſuppoſing him to be ſworn on the Holy Evangeliſts, as the phraſe is, what dignity in the bible, or any part of it; but what is derived from God its author? and what propriety in ſwearing a man by or on the goſpels, who can paſs his ſcornful and profane jeſts on them, as freely as blaſpheme their author? In a word it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to ſwear by the true God a man who does not know, fear, reverence and worſhip him. It is abſurd to ſwear a perſon on, or by the Evangeliſts, who does not believe them, and who openly manifeſts that he does not. Thus irreligious men, like Sampſon, graſp the pillars of the temple and pull them down to their own ruin and that of thouſands.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, if the internal bonds of the ſocial union were once properly ſtrengthened; there would be little occaſion for puniſhments. Crimes would be but comparatively few; ſuch as are of an atrocious nature fewer. Rulers would have little to do but to enjoy the honours of their office. And all this felicity can ſpring from no other ſource, but true religion and virtue. We have in the above argument ſuppoſed, that if our civil rulers do any-thing effectually for the advancement of religion; it muſt be the chriſtian religion: Becauſe we are a nation of profeſſed chriſtians. And it is certain, no religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on like it to gain theſe grand purpoſes. It was long ago fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, that theſe ſhould be the effects and fruits of it. The wolf ſhall dwell with the lamb; the leopard ſhall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child ſhall lead them: The lion and the bear ſhall feed; their young ones ſhall lie down together; the lion ſhall eat ſtraw like the ox; and the ſucking child ſhall play on the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:020203_0047_0FAE3CA7EDB3A178"/>
hole of the aſp; and the weaned child on the cockatrice's den; they ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy mountain, ſaith the Lord. In that ſtrong figurative ſtile, peculiar to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental nations, wicked men are repreſented under the images of wolves lions, bears, ſerpents, &amp;c. but it is foretold that by the influence of the goſpel, they ſhould put off the ferocity of their nature and become harmleſs as lambs and little children. And this is no viſionary thing; the goſpel has in numberleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, produced this effect. It has transformed the moſt wicked men into the moſt amiable and uſeful members of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. Why then ſeek to change the chriſtian religion for any other. Hath a nation changed their Gods, which yet are no Gods? but my people, ſays God, have changed their glory for that which ſhall not profit. Every nation under heaven will ſtudy to advance and ſupport the religion of their country, and indeed they cannot any other, until they know it; and why ſhould not we ſtudy to advance that which we have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe is the true religion; at leaſt it muſt be granted even by deiſts, that it has a better claim to that character, than any other in the world. It contains all the principles of natural religion, all its promiſes, all its precepts, and all its motives, and makes many valuable additions to them. No re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion comparable to it, to promote the peace, purity and feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of human ſociety. We ſhould make a miſerable exchange; if inſtead of it, we ſhould embrace judaiſm, mahometaniſm, or heatheniſm. But were any profeſſing theſe religions to come among us, it would be unjuſt and againſt chriſtianity to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them by force; or to diveſt them of any natural rights on that account; though conſiſtently enough they might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from places of power and truſt in the government; becauſe offices in any government are not natural rights. Thus in my opinion all forms of religion, the principles of which, do not ſubvert the foundation of good government; may be ſafely tolerated; but the man of no religion is the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and in fact is not a fit ſubject of moral government. In the caſe of crimes againſt the ſtate the perpetrators muſt be puniſhed; and in the preſent degenerate ſtate of ſociety among us, puniſhments will be often neceſſary, they ought to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly apportioned, neither exceeding in ſeverity nor lenity, and punctually and inflexibly executed. Our rulers ſhould ſtrike the blow at the root. Neglect and contempt of God, curſing, profane ſwearing, violation of the ſabbath, gaming and ſuch
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:020203_0048_0FAE3CA8CE67B6B0"/>
evils, ſhould feel their indignation; and as has been remarked, ſuch puniſhments will be auxiliary to the grand deſign of preventing crimes.</p>
            <p>All that has been ſaid above about the means of promoting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is perfectly conſiſtent with all the rights of conſcience. For what is conſcience? Let us attend to the former definition of it, or to ſum it up in fewer words, it may be called a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the obligation of the divine law. Can ever reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able beings pretend then, that they are bound by the divine law to violate that law? or that they are bound in conſcience to caſt off all conſcience. This is not much leſs abſurd, than to ſay that a man is bound to jump down his own throat. Liberty of conſcience is out of the queſtion, when we ſpeak of the duties of morality; it is equally foreign to the queſtion, when we ſpeak of the plain eſſential duties of religion, ſuch as acknowledging God, revering his ſacred name, keeping his ſabbath; or at leaſt devoting ſome part of our time to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and the ſeventh part is a rational and eaſy precept. Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of conſcience extends only to ſpeculative opinions and modes of worſhip. Full latitude in theſe ought to be granted. Our conſtitutions and laws grant it; our civil rulers diſcover no diſpoſition to infringe it. To promote religion and virtue is therefore ſo far from being a violation of the rights of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; that in fact, it is the only method to illuminate, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and ſtrengthen conſcience<note n="*" place="bottom">The writer of this publiſhed the ſubſtance of the ſeventh argument ſeveral years ago in Mr. London's paper of New-York; with a ſincere deſire to correct the extravagant ideas prevailing about religious liberty.</note>.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The truth which we defend, is ſupported by the uniform practice of all civilized nations. None of them pretend to erect or preſerve civil government without laying the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the fabrick in religious and moral ſentiments. This is a fact not only in modern times; but if we look back in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to antiquity we ſhall ſee it was equally the caſe. It is a fact not only in nations called chriſtian; but was equally ſo among the ancient heathen. Do we ſee any of the great legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of antiquity treating religion with neglect or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt? Nay, they earneſtly promoted it according to the light they had. And ſome of them to affect the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of their citizens the more; pretended to receive their laws from the Gods. They were men of underſtanding and ſenſe, and knew well, that unleſs they diffuſed abroad
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:020203_0049_0FAE3CA96462C220"/>
the knowledge, fear and worſhip of a deity; men are ſuch creatures, that all human authority and power would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to reſtrain them from the wildeſt outrages. It is allowed to be a good argument to prove the greateſt of all truths, the exiſtence of a ſupreme being; that all nations in all ages have unanimouſly agreed in it. The argument is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually good and concluſive in the preſent caſe. Our anceſtors were men of deep underſtanding in the ſcience of government. It was not for nothing, that they in their conſtitutions and laws, paid ſo much attention to religion. They may in ſome inſtances have run into error. But ſome in our days, in order to avoid their errors, have run into extremes equally if not more dangerous. The Weſtminſter confeſſion of faith ſeems to give rather too much power to the civil magiſtrate about the church. Theſe paſſages appear to have been adapted to civil eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of religion, which have no place in this country, and therefore are not applicable to our circumſtances. We ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to the confeſſion in theſe, only in ſo far as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the rights of conſcience, the ſpiritual and independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent nature of Chriſt's kingdom, the principles above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and eſtabliſhed, and the circumſtances in which provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath placed us.</p>
            <p>Finally, let us on this ſubject attend to fact and experience. Who are the people that croud our gaols and load our gibbets? are they the ſtrict profeſſors of the chriſtian religion? are they dragged from theſe religious ſocieties, where the pure doctrines of the goſpel are embraced? where God is worſhipped with chriſtian ſimplicity and purity? and where a ſtrict ſcriptural diſcipline is maintained? By no means. And we fear not to appeal for the truth of this obſervation to the greateſt enemies of religion. Are duellers, murderers, thieves, robbers, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, fornicators, profane ſwearers, and blaſphemers, to be found among the diſciples of the humble and Holy Jeſus? nay, there are examples of religious ſocieties conſiſting of many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſouls, of which we may boldly affirm, that in the ſpace of half a century or more, not half a dozen of their members have ſuffered by the hands of public juſtice in any form. And it would be a moſt proper expedient to elucidate this fact, that nations ſhould keep regiſters of all who ſuffer for their crimes; but eſpecially whether they profeſſed any religion, walked in communion with any church, and what their religion was; and publiſh theſe annually. This would bring fully to light, a truth
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:020203_0050_0FAE3CAD1712E7F8"/>
and fact, which would not reflect much honour on the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glecters and oppoſers of religion. It would then appear, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the theatre or the church, whether ſtage plays or the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, have the moſt ſalutary influence on the morals of mankind, and tend moſt to promote the good order of civil ſociety. O ye advocates for theatrical entertainments, mimickry and non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe, for duelling, gaming, balls, &amp;c. before ſuch a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, you would bluſh as the owl before the ſun! One might expect, were things conducted by reaſon in this world, that the above undeniable facts, would be ſufficient to induce civil communities, and their rulers; earneſtly to ſtudy to promote true religion; and give proper checks to the ſources of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and diſſolution above mentioned. They would not labour in vain. Good fruits would follow. All the virtues follow in the train of true religion.</p>
            <p>On the whole we confeſs it is extremely difficult perhaps im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, preciſely to fix limits on this ſubject; or to ſay parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly how far and no farther; communities &amp; rulers may go in their conſtitutions and laws to promote religion and virtue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. That they ought not by any means to invade the prerogatives of the church, or infringe upon the rights of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, is undoubtedly true. But that in order to avoid this invaſion and infringement, they ought to pay no attention to the ſubject; but permit the principles and bonds of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial union to be quite corrupted and diſſolved, is a moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and unreaſonable principle. This is the principle which I reprobate; and contend that as legiſlative bodies and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, would ſtudy the preſervation of the body politic, they muſt in order to this, ſtudy to promote religion and morality. The means to be uſed are not obſcure. They have been part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hinted. But the manner of applying theſe means; and how far civil authority may be ſafely uſed for the purpoſe; will require the deepeſt penetration and cloſeſt attention, to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern. And no doubt much may be learned from experience.</p>
            <p>I do not mean to intimate, that nothing of the kind, has been done in the United States. They have at leaſt given the fulleſt liberty to religion; that is, they declare they will not hinder or forbid it in any form. This is at leaſt favouring it in a negative way. But ſurely it is of ſo much importance to ſociety, as to merit ſome poſitive encouragement. We are convinced, that the idea of civil liberty entertained by many, amounts to licentiouſneſs, or a rejection of all due ſubordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

As to religion our caſe is much worſe; even ſenſible good men ſeem to have carried their ideas of the ſpiritual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the church, and her independency on the civil powers, to a dangerous extreme. While many others fondly imagine, that the civil authority ought to pay no regard to religion and morality at all, but allow, not only the fulleſt liberty as to principles and forms of religion; but even permit all, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to drop every principle and form of it, if they pleaſe. This is the dangerous error we would wiſh to overthrow; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſuaded, that a man in ſuch a ſtate, cannot poſſibly be a ſubject of moral government. There is no handle by which we can take hold of him; no principle by which we can bind him. We may ſubjoin here the words of a ſenſible writer on this ſubject<note n="*" place="bottom">See a piece, entitled, "True Patriotiſm, or Public Spirit, by Mr. Archibald Bruce, a member of the Aſſociate Synod of Edinburgh." The ſubſtance of which was delivered before ſaid Synod. Let the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates for a ſervile ſubordination to that Synod, compare theſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſentiments, with what they have publiſhed to the world as their principles on this ſubject.</note>: It may be difficult, ſays he, always to preſerve the diſtinction between the civil and eccleſiaſtical ſtate, and the rights and powers belonging to each, without encroachment on the one ſide or the other. Thoſe powers which are co-or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate, ſubſiſting together in the ſame time and place, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about ſome objects in common, but in a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, will be in great danger of interference: rivalſhip and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual jealouſies may be expected naturally to ariſe between them; and attempts will not be wanting to render one of them ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate and dependent on the other: and, in fact, ever ſince the magiſtrate became Chriſtian, theſe mutual ſtruggles and uſurpations have been almoſt unintermitting; and either the one or the other hath claimed, or actually exerciſed, an undue ſuperiority; ſometimes the eccleſiaſtical power overtopping, and baſely ſubjecting the temporal, as under the Papacy; or the temporal, in its turn, aſſuming a ſupremacy and legiſlative authority in ſpiritual things, as hath been, and continues to be, viſibly the caſe in many countries profeſſing the Reformation, and appears to become ſtill more and more the caſe in almoſt all nations of Chriſtendom, whether Proteſtant or Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic; which is a new kind of political Papacy, no leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and tyrannical than the former, rearing itſelf on the
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:020203_0052_0FAE3CAE7462F320"/>
ruins of the old. But yet in order to avoid one extreme, there is no neceſſity of running into another. A church and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth may have certain connections together, and may perform mutual offices and duties towards each other, without loſing their peculiar diſtinctive characters, and without being abſurdly blended together in one heterogeneous conſtitution. A medium may be found, however hard to hit, between an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſtian ſupremacy and Sectarian anarchy; tyrannical ſlavery and lawleſs licentiouſneſs.</p>
            <p>"If indifference about the cauſe of God be culpable in others, how can it be excuſable or laudable in rulers? Are they, of all men, excepted from the authority of Chriſt? or are they the only perſons who, by virtue of their office, are neceſſarily debarred from any poſſibility of knowing with certainty <hi>what is truth?</hi> Or are they, upon ſuch a diſcovery, under the hard neceſſity of neglecting, and, on the matter, renouncing it again; having their hands tied, in their official character, from ſhowing it any diſtinguiſhed reſpect, or affording it any peculiar aſſiſtance; being equally obliged, in order to rule well, to nurſe up its oppoſite with the ſame care and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs? Muſt the crown of Caeſar and the crown of Chriſt be ever at variance, and incapable of any friendly alliance? Shall a cry be raiſed among any, but ſuch as have a mind that Chriſt ſhould be crucified, that the man who ſhall paſs a ſentence in favour of Chriſt from the judgment-ſeat, is not "Caeſar's friend," nor a friend to the natural rights and liberties of mankind? Or is the ſceptre ſo profane, that it may not touch any thing that hath the image and ſuperſcription of Jeſus upon it? However ſuch maxims ſhould now be cried up as the quinteſſence and height of good policy, and as containing the model of the moſt perfect and happy government, I am afraid they can hardly be exempted from the charge of impiety.</p>
            <p>"A magiſtrate who, like <hi>Gallio,</hi> ſhould account religious matters none of his care, inſtead of meriting hereby the title of a good magiſtrate, would more properly deſerve that of an irreligious infidel or atheiſt."</p>

            <head>The Reader is deſired to attend to the following Notes:</head>
            <p>
               <hi>Note for Page 15.</hi> There is doubtleſs an infinite ſufficiency in the death of Chriſt for all men, yea for all the fallen angels. This we may affirm without any danger of exaggeration. The blood of the Son of God was and is ſufficient to waſh the fouleſt devils white. But it muſt be carefully obſerved that the neceſſity of an infinite atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment does not ariſe from the number but nature of ſin. It is as neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the pardon of one ſin, as ten thouſand—to the ſalvation of one ſinner as ten millions. It would eclipſe the glory of the divine character, and be as repugnant to his holineſs, juſtice and moral go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to pardon one ſinner without an atonement, as to pardon ten thouſand millions. For he that offends in one point, is guilty of all; and if one ſin in its nature did not infer the neceſſity of an infinite atonement to pardon, ten thouſand millions would not infer that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; becauſe degrees do not alter the ſpecies or kind; numbers do not vary nature. If we then reſt the argument about the extent of Chriſt's death, on its infinite ſufficiency; that argument will extend it to all the devils as well as to all men; yea, to every thing that is in any manner affected by the ſin of angels and men. If we do not build it on its ſufficiency, as indeed it is prepoſterous and abſurd to do ſo; then it muſt reſt on the divine ſovereignty. And in fact no other reaſon can be aſſigned why God appointed his death for men and not for the fallen angels. Well then if the extent of his death reſts on the divine ſovereignty; the concluſion of that argument is, that Chriſt died juſt for thoſe for whom God ſaw meet to appoint his death. And it follows, that he died only for his ſheep, I lay down my life for the ſheep, or thoſe given to Him by the Father. Some will ſay this is diſcouraging doctrine. But why diſcouraging? For even ſuppoſing Chriſt ſhed his blood for all men, it is clear from the bible that without faith in it, it would avail you nothing. And the ſame word aſſures you, that if you believe in him, accept and ſubmit to him, you ſhall be certainly ſaved by him. Thus ſuppoſing the falſe doctrine true, you are juſt where you were, it could give you no more comfort than you now have. For if any accept of Chriſt as offered in the goſpel this aſcertains the appointment of the death of Chriſt for him; on this ground he may ſtand and look back into the eternal councils and ſee God appointing Chriſt's death for him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note for Page 16.</hi> I have ſaid that it would be no act of ſtrict diſtributive injuſtice, were Jeſus Chriſt to coſt even true believers e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally from his preſence. This may at firſt alarm ſome honeſt minds;
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:020203_0054_0FAE3CAF8E14D008"/>
I will therefore explain: By ſtrict diſtributive juſtice I mean treating a perſon according to his perſonal merit or demerit: now were the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of true believers an act of juſtice in that ſenſe, it is manifeſt, it could not be an act of mere grace and mercy; if they perſonally me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited pardon and ſalvation, they would be juſtified by works, not by grace; but their ſalvation is ever in the ſcriptures aſcribed to rich ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign grace. Neither the act nor merit of Chriſt's righteouſneſs can with propriety be ſaid to be transfuſed into believers ſo as to become really their perſonal act and merit. But his complete righteouſneſs is ſuſtained in law as the ground or reaſon of their juſtification; and God is juſt in juſtifying them; diſtributive juſtice can make no objection to their ſalvation, though it do not require it. Juſtification is not a real but a relative change: It is not the infuſion of righteouſneſs, but only placing righteouſneſs to the perſon's account and treating him accordingly; all which is grace, not diſtributive juſtice. But juſtice taken in a large ſenſe, in which ſenſe it includes whatever is morally fit and proper to be done, certainly demands their ſalvation. God muſt be juſt to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, true to his word, faithful to the promiſes of his grace and mercy, juſt to reward the ſufferings of his Son and the fruits of his own gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Spirit in the hearts and lives of true believers. Among many other texts that might be quoted in proof of my aſſertion, I ſhall only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to <hi>Pſ. 51—11.</hi> Caſt me not away from thy preſence, &amp;c. and indeed the whole Pſalm is to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>Pſ. 130—3,</hi> if thou Lord ſhouldſt mark iniquity, O Lord! who could ſtand, <hi>Lam. 3—22,</hi> it is of the Lord's mercies we are not conſumed, <hi>Mal. 3—6,</hi> I am God I change not therefore the ſons of Jacob are not conſumed, <hi>Pſ. 143—2,</hi> Enter not into judgment with thy ſervant, for in thy ſight ſhall no fleſh living be juſtified. And even thoſe Chriſtians who may be ſtartled at the expreſſion will juſtify it in their prayers. They will freely confeſs God would be juſt and his throne guiltleſs were he to caſt them into hell. They pray for mere mercy; and this is the tenor of all their addreſſes to the throne of grace.</p>
