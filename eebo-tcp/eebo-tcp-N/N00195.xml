            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

When</hi> Coepio <hi>was dead his Brother</hi> Cato <hi>expended eight Talents in erecting for him a Tomb of</hi> Thracian <hi>marble, that his brothers Name might never dye.

And I am the rather wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to do so, for that these Sermons (though much short of what they would have been had the Author Himself emitted them) when first in this way made publick found great acceptance with the Lords People. As for this</hi> second Impression, <hi>it hath been promoved by the charity of a pious Gentlewoman (a Mother in this</hi> Israel) <hi>who out of respect to her own Children and Posterity, as also the good of the</hi> Rising Generation in <hi>New-England, was desirous (God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving put it into her heart) to encourage the Republication and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persion of what is here presented.</hi>

               <hi>Concerning the Author, my near Relation to him prohibits my saying much, nor is it needful; since it is well known that he was a</hi> Common Father <hi>unto all those Plantations in this Wilderness, where God had cast his Habitation. He was for several years, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much exercised with inward, spiritual Temptations. Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation (said</hi> Luther) <hi>maketh a Divine: It doth so indeed, though it may be the Temptations are sometimes</hi> Horribillia de Deo, Terribillia de Fide. <hi>The Lord did sanctifie the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons

of this my Brother, so as to keep him humble and low thoughted of himself; And doubtless they were one Reason of his being such an inward searching Preacher, as I know not whether he hath left any amongst us, in that respect going beyond him. Howbeit, just before his last sickness, God did graciously lift up the Light of his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and shine in upon his Soul. For the last words which I find written in his</hi> Diary, <hi>are these,</hi> July 10. 1669. This Evening if my heart deceive me not, some sweet workings of Soul after God in Christ, according to the Terms of the Covenant of grace; The general and Indefinite expression of the Promise was an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to look to Christ, that he would do that for me, which he hath promised to do for some, and I need as much as any; The Lord hath not excluded me, nor dare I exclude my self. But if the Lord will help I desire to lye at his Feet, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of grace in his own way, and to wait his own Time through his Power enabling of me; Though I am dead, without strength, help or hope in my self, yet the Lord requireth nothing at my hand in my own strength<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> but that by his Power I should look to him, to work all my works in me and for me. When I find a dead heart the thoughts of this are exceeding sweet and reviving, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of grace, and discovering the very heart and love of Jesus. <hi>These were (so far as doth appear) the last words that ever he wrote in his Life. The next day, finding himself not well, he set his House in order, his sickness proving a violent Feaver. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter twelve dayes Conflict with that disease he went to the Bosome of that Jesus, of whose heart<g ref="char:punc">â–ª</g> and love towards him, He had such a late and blessed discovery. This did the Lord find him. And bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed is that Servant whom the Lord at his coming shall find so doing.</hi>

            </epigraph>
            <p>IN the beginning of this Chapter we have the Historical Relation of a General Assembly of the Representative Body of <hi>Israel,</hi> the end whereof was the bringing in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p n="2">2. His famous Prayer, from <hi>ver.</hi> 22, to 54.</p>

2. The Illustration, <hi>As he was with our Fathers.</hi> In the latter there is a gemination of the same Request, by divers expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions importing the same thing, <hi>Let him not leave us, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake us.</hi> And all this is to note the weightiness of the thing prayed for and earnestness of desire that it might be granted. Whence the Doctrine to be observed from the words, is,</p>
            <q>Doct. That the Continuance of the Lords gracious Presence with a People, from Fathers to Children after them, is a special favour of God, and much to be desired by all that are cordial to the weal of the Israel of God. Or thus: That the Lord would be graciously present with the Succeeding Generation, as he was with their Fathers, not leaving nor forsaking of them, is the great desire of those that wish well to the Lords people.</q>
            <p>See some Scriptures for this.</p>
            <p>That the Lords gracious Presence is a special favour, and much to be desired, see <hi>Gen</hi> 26. 3. This we see was <hi>Moses</hi> his great request, <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 15. <hi>q. d.</hi> what is an Angel without thee? what is <hi>Canaan</hi> without thee? See also <hi>Josh.</hi> 1. 5. and <hi>Judg.</hi> 6. 16. And that the Succession of the Lords Presence from one Generation to another, is especially to be desired, see 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 22. 10. and 28. 20. <hi>Psal.</hi> 90. 16.</p>
            <p>A few words briefly for the Explication of this Doctrine: Application being the main thing intended.</p>
            <p>Quest. 1 <hi>What is meant by the Lords being with them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> First, there is an <hi>Essential Presence</hi> of God, whereby he is every where, not excluded out of Hell, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. 7. this is not the thing that <hi>Solomon</hi> prayes for here.</p>
            <p>Secondly, there is a <hi>Gracious Presence</hi> of God; and this is the thing here desired: and this contains as much good as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly can be desired; universality, fulness, perpetuity of good is in the Lords gracious Presence. This in the inchoation of it is the beginning of Heaven, in the perfection of it, it is the compleatment of Heaven. Now God is graciously present divers wayes.</p>

That faithfulness and mercy that fathers had experience of, do not put a stop to it at their Children, but let there be a succession of grace to their Successors. 3. To cast off by way of contempt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>Hos.</hi> 4. 11. And for that word <hi>Forsake,</hi> it signifies liberty, or freedome in leaving, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 9. 5.

            <p>Moreover there are special Reasons why the <hi>Lords presence</hi> should be desired to succeeding Generations, which shall be but mentioned.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> from the less to the greater: we desire other bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings for Children, much more should we desire this; you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to leave an Inheritance to your Children, <hi>Prov.</hi> 13. 22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. 14. there is much more reason to desire that they might inherit the Lords blessing.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> Because they have as much need of the Lords Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence as their Fathers; their Fathers could not live and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie God in their generation, had not the Lord been with them, no more can those that succeed them, there is like ground to desire for the one as for the other, in respect of need, that one hath as well as other: 1.

            <p>

It stands all to consider (both such of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Generations, that are yet surviving, &amp; those of this other Generation, that are succeeding in the room of their Fathers) What, is God with us as in times past? God was with them, &amp; is he with us, as he was with them? Let us view the footsteps of God, and mark whether the Lord be with us, as in days of old. And for that end I shall spread before you some <hi>Signs of the Lords leaving a people.</hi> And the first is this.</p>
            <p>First Sign. <hi>When the Lord gives up a people to a slight Spirit,</hi> not minding the Lords Presence, whether with them, or farre off from them: Surely the Lord cannot be very near unto that people, that are not sensible of it. The presence of Gods grace is a very evident sensible thing, and therefore if men feel not this, nor mourn not for the want of it; it is a symptome the Lord is withdrawn. Hence the Lord warns his people, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 8. <hi>Be instructed, O Ierusalem, lest my soul depart from thee;</hi> if unsensible, and unmindful, I will be gone further and further from you, <hi>Ier.</hi> 26. when people are left to a regardless heart, respecting the tokens of the Lords displeasure against them, <hi>

               </hi> feel other things leave them, but not the Lord. It is not with them as it was wont to be in respect of Trade, the fruits of the Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this they take notice of, but take no notice how it is with them in respect of the Lords Presence Jer. 44. 17. 18 <hi>Then we had plenty of victuals, and were well, and saw no evil; but since wanted all things, have been consumed by the Sword, and by the Famine,</hi> They take notice of outward plenty, and outward scarcity, of abundance and plenty respect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things of this life, but as to the Lords Presence with them, not a word spoken of that. As mens hearts upon serious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the Lords nearness to, or removal from them are affected or not affected therewith, so is the Lord answera<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bly abiding with, or leaving of a People. The Lord is farre gon when there is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

that passeth from man to man, from Plantation to Plantation, from Generation to Generation? Is this the Enquiry of the old and gray-headed, Oh, is the Lord with us as he was wont to be?
