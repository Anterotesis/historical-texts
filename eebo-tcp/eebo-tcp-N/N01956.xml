            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHEN <hi>Jacob</hi> awoke out of his ſleep he was ſtruck with a great <hi>awe</hi> and holy reverence, as well he might, and indeed ought to be. He was <hi>afraid,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>How dreadful is this place!</hi> He ſet up the <hi>stones</hi> whereon he had ſlept for a <hi>Pillar</hi> and Monument of that memorable event: He called the Place <hi>Bethel,</hi> i. e. <hi>the houſe of God;</hi> and then made his ſolemn <hi>Vow</hi> in the Words of my <hi>Text; And Jacob vowed a Vow, ſaying, If God will be with me, and will keep me,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

1. THE <hi>Matter</hi> of his Vow, or the thing vow'd, which is plain, ſhort, and full; <hi>The Lord ſhall be my God. Jehovah,</hi> the true God, his Father's God, ſhould be his God. He <hi>owns</hi> Gods propriety in him, domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over him, right and title to him. He <hi>chuſes</hi> God for his God, and makes a free ſubmiſſion, a voluntary ſurrender of himſelf to him, and devotes himſelf to his ſervice and glory, to worſhip and obey him, <hi>as God and his God.</hi> He <hi>covenants</hi> for himſelf; for he had been circumciſed in his Infancy, and given up to God in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; ſet apart for him, by his mark put upon him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE <hi>Manner</hi> of this Vow, is ſomething in form of a <hi>Condition, If God will be with me, and keep,</hi> &amp;c. But here we muſt obſerve,
<list>
                  <item>1. THAT to be ſure <hi>he meant not to preſcribe</hi> any terms or conditions to the Great God, which unleſs he fulfilled, he ſhould not be his God. Far be this from our Thought, as it was from his. Suppoſe that God ſhould deny him bread to eat, and raiment to put on; ſuppoſe he ſhould never bring him back again to his Father's houſe; ſhould God then be none of his God? God forbid. We are taught to ſay, and no doubt <hi>Jacob</hi> had learnt as much, Job. 13.15. <hi>Tho' he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>JACOB</hi> certainly meant by this manner of ſpeech, <hi>If the Lord will be with me,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to expreſs his faith in the word and promiſe of God</hi> juſt before given him, v. 15. <hi>Behold I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest, and bring thee again into this land.</hi> Now ſays <hi>Jacob, "Seeing</hi>

He depends upon God's <hi>word</hi> to him, and makes his <hi>vows</hi> to God. Or,</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>JACOB</hi> meant it <hi>as a prayer</hi> to the God of his Life, his great Preſerver and Benefactor, that he would be with him in his way, and thro' his Life; guide, provide for him, and bleſs him, as he had ſaid; and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002325_0005_0FDB24F98EECE858"/>then he ſubjoyns a religious promiſe and holy engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to God, as meet to render for ſuch Benefits. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to what we read, Job. 22.27. <hi>Thou ſhalt make thy PRAYER unto him, and he ſhall hear thee, and then ſhalt pay thy vows.</hi> And taking it thus as a <hi>prayer</hi> and deſire to God, we may obſerve theſe <hi>three</hi> things of it.

                        <item>1. THAT his firſt petition is for the <hi>preſence</hi> of God with him, and his <hi>favour</hi> to him, which is more than life.</item>
                        <item>2. THAT his requeſt as to worldly things is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>modeſt, humble</hi> and <hi>moderate.</hi> He asks only <hi>bread to eat, and raiment to put on:</hi> He leaves it with God to chooſe for him convenient food: If he have but juſt enough, and bare neceſſaries, it ſhould content him, And,</item>
                        <item>3. OBSERVE how his natural and pious <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to his father's houſe and his native place</hi> wrought in him: <hi>So that I come again to my father's houſe in peace.</hi> He hop'd to find his <hi>dear Parents</hi> alive at his return; he in effect begs this of God, that he might again ſee their faces. "<hi>Eſau</hi> had longed (as one notes) for the <hi>days of mourning for his father:</hi> Not ſo <hi>Jacob;</hi> no, one ſpecial thing his heart was ſet on is, that he might ſee again the venerable face of his <hi>Father,</hi> who was already blind with age.</item>

            </p>
            <p>BUT I will not detain you any longer in deſcant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the copious <hi>Text:</hi> The ſum is, If God ſhould pleaſe to favour him in theſe his petitions, he ſhould ever hold himſelf moſt ſtrongly engaged to <hi>cleave</hi> to him and <hi>rejoyce</hi> in him as his God.</p>
            <p>UPON all, there is the abundant <hi>Grace</hi> &amp; condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bleſſed GOD to be ſeen, in his allowing duſt and aſhes to ſpeak to him and covenant with him after this manner; <hi>i. e.</hi> after our own manner. As <hi>parents</hi> on earth give leave to their Children to expreſs their affection, reverence and duty to them after their childiſh manner; ſo does our <hi>Father in heaven</hi> by his poor children here on earth.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I SHALL ſpeak to this <hi>Doctrine</hi> under the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heads.
<list>
                     <item>1. That we are under the vow and bond of God from our <hi>Infancy.</hi>

                     <item>2. That the vow we are then brought under is this. <hi>That the Lord ſhall be our God.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. That children ſhould be early taught this, and often ſeriouſly admoniſhed of it; and as our young people <hi>grow up</hi> in their fathers houſes, they ſhould ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002325_0007_0FDB24FD9FCA7938"/>prepare to take this vow upon themſelves, and make it to the Lord with holy ſolemnity.</item>
                     <item>4. That when they are leaving their parents houſes, and <hi>going forth into the world,</hi> may be a very proper ſeaſon for ſuch a ſolemn tranſaction with the Holy God.</item>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>WE are under the vow and bond of God from our Infancy.</hi> So was <hi>Jacob</hi> from his birth: At eight days old he received the token of God's Covenant in his <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> which was the <hi>ſeal of the ſame righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of faith</hi> that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> now is to us, in the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of it in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church: The ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant and <hi>bleſſing being come upon us Gentiles by faith,</hi> which God gave to <hi>Abraham;</hi> namely this, <hi>I will be a God to thee and to thy ſeed.</hi> Our Children therefore from their Infancy are as much in the Covenant ſtate, and the initiating ſeal of the Covenant does as much belong to them, as the Covenant of Circumciſion did to the Infants under the Law. <hi>Elſe were your children unclean, but now they are holy,</hi> 1 Cor. 7.14. We there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are under the vow and bond of God from our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy: And no doubt but ſo were the <hi>firſt</hi> children that were born into the world accounted and dedicated to God; which it may be <hi>Eve</hi> meant when ſhe ſaid upon the birth of <hi>Cain, I have gotten a man from the Lord;</hi> a child <hi>for</hi> him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THE <hi>Vow</hi> that we are brought under by the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of God from our <hi>Infancy,</hi> and by our <hi>Baptiſm</hi> then, is this in the <hi>Text, That the Lord ſhall be our God.</hi> This 'tis, and neither more nor leſs; as God gave it to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and as it is come on us, Gen. 17.7. <hi>And I will eſtabliſh my covenant betwen me and thee, and thy ſeed after thee in their generations, to be a God to thee, and to thy ſeed after thee.</hi> We and our ſeed therefore have ſignificantly ſaid <hi>of</hi> and <hi>to</hi> the Lord, <hi>He ſhall be my God. Jacob</hi> now ſaid for himſelf, no more than what his Father <hi>Iſaac</hi> had ſaid for him, and bound upon him, in the day when he circumciſed him. The Covenant is now given to us in the ſame Words, Heb. 8.20. <hi>I will be to you a God, and ye ſhall be to me a people.</hi> This is the compendium, the ſummary and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002325_0008_0FDB11DA856C5610"/>ſubſtance of the <hi>Covenant of Grace;</hi> comprehending all the mercy, grace, favour and bleſſing promiſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> 
                  <hi>God's part</hi> in the Goſpel of <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and all the duty and obedience required and engaged <hi>on ours.</hi> So ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>broad</hi> are theſe few words, <hi>The Lord ſhall be my God.</hi> The Covenant Engagement which our <hi>Infants</hi> are brought under in their Baptiſm, is this in the Text, <hi>The Lord ſhall be my God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">OUR Children ſhould be <hi>early taught</hi> this, and often admoniſhed of it by their parents; <hi>and as they grow up ſhould be put on a ſerious preparation to take this Vow upon themſelves, and make it their own Act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT ſhould be the care of parents early to inſtruct their Children in the Covenant Bonds to God which they are under, and to charge them with the ſerious remembrance of them, and to prepare as they grow up to recognize the ſame. The mother of <hi>Solomon</hi> did ſo by him; ſhe taught him that he was <hi>the ſon of her vows,</hi> and under a holy dedication to God.</p>
               <p>AND as Children arrive at Years of underſtanding, the firſt thing that ſhould be prepared for, and ſeriouſly done by them is this, the taking their Baptiſmal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant on themſelves, and giving themſelves up to God.</p>
               <p>IT was your Parents Act in your Baptiſm, and they did well to bring you to God in his appointed Way, and under his holy Bonds: they had right, power and authority to do as they did; they did but their Duty to God and to you: they can oblige you in other things, and can't they in this, that the Lord ſhall be your God? they can Act for you in your name to Men, and bind you for your good; and why not to God? The Mother of <hi>Samuel</hi> vow'd him to God before he was conceived within her; and he religiouſly ſtood to her Act.</p>
               <p>OUR Children owe it to God and to their Parents, and to the Church of Chriſt, to abide by their Baptiſm, and join themſelves to the Lord in an everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, by their own Act and Deed. In this, if in any thing they <hi>obey their parents in the Lord;</hi> and wherein can they more profanely and impiouſly deſpiſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002325_0009_0FDB250389163F88"/>to obey them, than if they abide not by the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Dedication that they made of them to God from their Birth-Could your Parents do better for you than they did? or can you do better for your ſelves than to ſtand to their pious Act in your behalf, and in obedience to God who gave you to them? If they did ill by thee you ſhall not be obliged by it; but if well, why ſhould you depart from it?</p>
               <p>CAN there be a more direct Way to the great End of thy Being, (the Glory of God from thee, in thy own everlaſting Happineſs) than thy kapriſmal Decicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the Womb, and thy early Recogaition thereof, in uprightneſs and with ſolemnity? Thy <hi>Saviour</hi> was ſo circumciſed and preſeated in the <hi>Temple</hi> according to the Law, and <hi>at twelve Years old he went up with his parents to the Paſſover:</hi> And <hi>wiſt you not</hi> that you too ſhould be betimes <hi>about your heavenly Father's Buſineſs,</hi> and careful for your own Souls Salvation? <hi>remembering your Creator in the Days of your youth,</hi> and <hi>ſecking him early?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>OUR baptized Children are obliged actually, formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and explicitly, to aſſent and conſent to the Covenant of Grace when they come to years; to chuſe the Lord to ſerve him, and let them refuſe at their peril! it were Atheiſm, blaſphemy and rebellion in them to reject their Fathers God and deſpiſe his Covenant; and it were Damnation to them to do it.

               <p>HERE I will chuſe to propoſe, and make ſome An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to theſe three Enquiries.
<list>
                     <item>1. What is the <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                        <pb n="9" facs="unknown:002325_0010_0FDB25051E42B828"/>of this ſacred Word and <hi>Act, the Lord ſhall be my God's</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. <hi>How</hi> ſhould our Children come into it?</item>
                     <item>3. <hi>Why</hi> ſhould they do ſo?</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>WHAT is the meaning of this ſacred Word and Act; the Lord ſhall be my God?</hi> I anſwer, briefly and in general; (for my time will not allow me to branch our into particulars and enlarge on them)</p>
               <p>TO ſay unto God that He ſhall be our God implies,
<list>
                     <item>1. A <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of his rightful propriety in us, and Dominon over us, and our indiſpenſable obligation to be his, only and wholly, for ever to worſhip, obey and glorify him.</item>
                     <item>2. It ſuppoſes to be ſure a <hi>rejection</hi> and abjuration of all things beſides God; our ſelves and the fleſh, the world and the devil, the ſervice of Sin and Satan, and all falſe Gods eſpecially, and falſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</item>
                     <item>3.

                     <item>4.

               </p>
               <p>IN a Word, For us to ſay, The Lord ſhall be my God, is
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>To take him to be to us</hi> all that which he is in himſelf unto his reaſonable Creatures, and all that which in his word and Covenant, thro' Jeſus Chriſt, he tenders himſelf to be unto periſhing penitent Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: And</item>

               </p>
               <p>WELL then. Have we ever ſaid thus to the Lord, <hi>Thou art and ſhalt be my God!</hi> Can we, do we, will we ſay it? Or rather, have we not ſaid it in our <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> and ſome of us at the <hi>Table</hi> of Chriſt? Do we not ſay it in our ſolema <hi>worſhiping</hi> of God from time to time, in publick and in private? Have we on any <hi>ſingular
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002325_0011_0FDB2509D73BF7B0"/>Occaſions</hi> ſaid thus to God, under the impreſſions of <hi>mercies</hi> ſhown us, or in the purſuit of them? or in our <hi>griefs</hi> and ſorrows, <hi>fears</hi> and dangers? Or ſhould we not ſay to God as they, Joſh. 24.24. <hi>We are witneſſes that we have choſen the Lord our God to ſerve him: The Lord our God we will ſerve, and his voice we will obey?</hi> Pſal. 48.14. <hi>This God is our God for ever and ever; be ſhall be our guide even to death?</hi> Pſal. 119.57. <hi>Thou art my portion, O Lord, I ſaid that I will keep thy word.</hi> And let our children now ſay, Pſal. 122.20. <hi>Thou art my God from my mother's belly:</hi> And Exod. 15.2. <hi>He is my God, and I will prepare him an habitation, my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's God, and I will exalt him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. BUT ſecondly. <hi>How</hi> ſhould our young people come into this ſacred word and act; to ſay, <hi>The Lord ſhall be my God?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ANSWER,
<list>
                     <item>1. To be ſure <hi>not reſhly, ſuddenly, light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and without ſerious conſideration of the thing, and preparation for it; and ſome good grounds to hope that God has given us a heart to ſay it in a right manner. Our danger is raſhneſs, and youth is prone to be ſudden and confident. Let <hi>Solomor's</hi> Caution therefore be ever kept in mind, and ly with weight upon us, Eccl. 5.</item>
                     <item>2. <hi>Be not raſh with thy mouth to utter any thing before God,</hi> and in vowing to him. Be ſenſible and fearful of thy <hi>wicked and deceitful heart,</hi> and <hi>jealous over thy ſelf with a godly jealouſy.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>THEREFORE, 2. Be very <hi>ſerious, deliberate, ſolemn</hi> in a tranſaction of this nature; conſider of it, and pray over it, and continue in prayer: Implore the Divine Grace to make thee upright and keep thee ſo; commit thy ſelf to it, and make trial of thy ſelf if thy heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide with God, if his Spirit in his bleſſed Influences be with thee; and after ſome happy experience hereof, in a growing humility for ſin, watch againſt it, deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter holineſs, delight in prayer, meditation, and reading God's word, and a fixed purpoſe of heart (truſting in God) to govern your ſelf by it all your dayes, you may humbly renew your Vows to God, and your Covenant with him. And 1. Do it very ſeriouſly in <hi>ſecret</hi> before
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002325_0012_0FDB250B141DC3D8"/>the Lord; and 2. <hi>Openly</hi> and ſolemnly before the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>VERY ſeriouſly in ſecret;</hi> after much prayer, and ſome good time of experience, and reaſon to hope that thy heart is ſincere with God; as I ſaid before. Enter then into thy cloſet, and fall on thy knees before thy Father which ſees in ſecret: Beg of him to accept of thee in Chriſt, to poſſeſs thee by his Spirit, to ſanctify thee to his ſervice and glory, to ſeal to thee the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of ſin, to ſhed abroad of his love in thy ſoul, to make thee fear always; to ſearch thee and know thy heart, to try thee and know thy thoughts, and ſee if there be any wicked thing in thee, and to lead thee in the way everlaſting. And having done this ſeriouſly in ſecret, then</p>
               <p n="2">2. PROCEED to do it <hi>openly,</hi> in publick, in the face of the World: Go to thy <hi>Paſtor,</hi> who is required by Chriſt to feed his lambs, lay open thy reader and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt heart before him, receive with reverence his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, counſel and advice in the matter, his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions and charges from God; let him receive thy profeſſions and lay them before the Church of Chriſt; and join (yea give) thy ſelf to the people of God, chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them for thy people, and their God for thy God.</p>
               <p>THIS was the primitive way, 2 Cor. 8.5. <hi>They firſt gave their own ſelves to the Lord, and to us by the will of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AFTER this manner <hi>our Fathers,</hi> in theſe Churches of our <hi>Lord Jeſus,</hi> from the beginning of this land, firſt took the Lord to be their God, and then gave their Poſterity to him; taking the Scripture for their rule and directory in this matter; and we ariſe and declare it to our children, that they might ſet their hope in God, and do his Commands. We would call upon them and change them as <hi>David</hi> did his <hi>Solomon,</hi> 1 Chron. 28. 9. <hi>And thou Solomon my Son, know thou the God of thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſerve him,</hi> &amp;c. And we take comfort in thoſe of our children, who in the manner before deſcribed have given, or do give themſelves to the Lord, as their God. And now I ſuppoſe I need not ſpend many more
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002325_0013_0FDB250CADD0BE98"/>words upon the third thing propos'd, which is,</p>
               <p n="3">3. TO give ſome reaſons <hi>why</hi> our young people ſhould betimes prepare for this very ſerious tranſaction with God? For ſurely nothing can be more <hi>juſt,</hi> nothing more <hi>neceſſary.</hi> Had your parents never gone before you, to lead you and oblige you in this thing, yet in point of <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>intereſt</hi> it had been incumbent on you. There muſt needs be an <hi>eternal</hi> and <hi>unchangeable Obligation</hi> on the reaſonable Creature, to ſay unto the GOD that made him, to rule and govern him, <hi>The Lord ſhall homy God.</hi> It is a <hi>law</hi> written on every heart of man, and graven in our rational natures; thy <hi>Conſcience</hi> bears witneſs to this, and thy <hi>thoughts</hi> approve it, and render thee a law to thy ſelf in this matter. Thy Obligation to it is <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant</hi> and <hi>perpetual,</hi> and nothing can releaſe thee from it. Turn thy thoughts any way thou wilt, you can ſind nothing <hi>againſt</hi> what has been propos'd, but every thing is <hi>for</hi> it.</p>
               <p>CAN any thing be more <hi>reaſonable, righteous, grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> from thee, than to ſay of and unto the Lord, thy Maker, Preſerver, Father, Benefactor, <hi>The Lord ſhall be my God?</hi> can any thing be more <hi>honourable</hi> to thee, than to be allowed this? Can any thing be more <hi>beneficial</hi> to thee than this wiſe and good Act? whereby you put your ſelf betimes in the way of God's favour, care, grace and bleſſing? Can you act <hi>better</hi> for Soul or Body? for your temporal, ſpiritual, or eternal ſelicity? Or can any thing be more <hi>injurious and detrimental</hi> to thee, than the neglect of God thy Maker and Judge? which he juſtly interprets a renouncing of him, and will re venge accordingly, by an utter rejection of them that take him not for their God! Why ſhould you, a Son of <hi>Adam</hi> who was <hi>the Son of God,</hi> go out like <hi>Cain</hi> from the preſence of the Lord, and run into the everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of his glory. Finally, conſider the <hi>diſhonour and injury done to Christ,</hi> by thee a baptiſed Child of his houſe, if you do not early lay hold of the better Covenant, and promiſes <hi>in him,</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by his blood, publiſhed in his Goſpel, and ſealed to thee in the Sacraments of Chriſtianity: Thro' him it
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002325_0014_0FDB250E18FC7430"/>is that God is now ready to be thy God, and to receive thee graciouſly and love thee freely. You deſpiſe the riches of grace in Chriſt, and trample under foot the blood of the Everlaſting Covenant, if your Soul does not conſent to and cloſe with <hi>the God of Abraham, the Father of our Lord Jeſus,</hi> ſaying to him, The Lord ſhall be my God. We are under the <hi>last</hi> diſpenſation of the Covenant, a diſpenſation of the cleareſt <hi>light and grace;</hi> whereof the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> ſpake by the <hi>Prophet, In thoſe days I will make a new Covenant with the Houſe of Iſrael.</hi> The <hi>bleſſings</hi> of this ſure and well order'd Covenant are importunately tender'd to you and urg'd upon you from your infancy, and the <hi>terms</hi> thereof explained, the way of holineſs laid plain before you; the word is <hi>nigh</hi> thee before thy eyes and in thy ears dayly, and what canst thou ſay, or how wilt thou eſcape, if you neglect and contemn ſo great Salvation.</p>
               <p>THUS I have ſhown that we are under the Covenant and vow of God from our Infancy, and that it is <hi>this</hi> in ſhort, that the Lord ſhall be our God: I have hinted the <hi>Import</hi> of this Covenant Engagement, &amp; the <hi>reaſons why,</hi> as well as the <hi>manner</hi> wherein our Children as they grow up with us, ſhould renew their baptiſmal Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: It remains yet in the 4th Place, to add,</p>
               <p n="4">4. THAT it may be <hi>a very proper ſeaſon and time,</hi> for our Children (ſeriouſly diſpoſed and rightly prepared (to do this, when the Providence of God calls them <hi>to leave their father's houſe and go forth into the World.</hi> This was <hi>Jacob's</hi> caſe in the text, and as it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes yours, God give you his heart and ſpirit. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing is <hi>beautiful in its ſeaſon,</hi> and this Act of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is truly ſo at <hi>ſuch</hi> a ſeaſon. For the World you are going into is an Enemy to God and to religion; but this frame and Act of <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhall help to guard you againſt and ſave you from its temptations and ſnares; as it did <hi>Joſeph</hi> (the beloved Son of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the heir of his grace and good Spirit) who remembred his father's God when he was ſold and carried away, and kept his Covenant, and <hi>the God of his Father was with him</hi> and bleſs'd him, and made all that he did to proſper. So
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002325_0015_0FDB2512E357AB20"/>do thou ſtand to the Covenant of God, and commend thy ſelf to his ſpecial providential care, and Covenant kindneſs; and tho' you may not ſee with your eyes the <hi>Angels</hi> of God, and his hoſts when you need them, yet you may be ſure they will be near thee, <hi>to bear thee up in their arms;</hi> to miniſter to thee in troubles, and to defend thee in danger, of to gather thee in their arms for <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſome.</p>

               <p>AND ſo I have run thro' the firſt <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which was, That young people as they grow up under the roof of their parents, and under the admonitions of the word of God, and before or as they leave their fathers houſe and go forth into the world, ſhould be able and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſeriouſly to renew their Covenant with God, and <hi>avouch the Lord Jehovah to be their God.</hi>

                  <hi>DOCT. II.</hi> THAT in making this Vow to God (if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline and enable you to do it) as you grow up in your parents houſes, or are leaving the ſame, you must ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly implore and humbly confide in the ſpecial preſence,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002325_0016_0FDB2514DF0E0AF0"/>favour and grace of God to be with you, and keep you in the way that you go. <hi>If God will be with me, ſaid</hi> Jacob, <hi>and keep me in this way that I go.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>IN which words he <hi>implores</hi> the ſpecial <hi>providential</hi> preſence of God with him; and not only ſo, but his <hi>ſpiritual</hi> preſence alſo, and the keeping of God's grace; and indeed <hi>commits</hi> himſelf thereunto, puts his truſt therein, caſts himſelf upon it, for guidance, protection and bleſſing, and for influence, ſanctification, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in duty &amp; obedience: And God ſaid not to him, ſeek to me, truſt in me, in vain.</p>
               <p>NO more will he to any of the believing, praying <hi>ſeed of Iſrael,</hi> who ſet him always before them, and whoſe ſpirits are ſtedfaſt with him: Who ever eye him in his governing Providence, ordering and diſpoſing eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that befals them; and in every thing by pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſupplication with thankſgiving make their requeſts known unto him; who rely on him for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, ſafety and ſucceſs in their affairs, and aſcribe all they receive to him; who thus daily are giving glory to him, and ſtaying themſelves on him; who thus keep up a conſtant communion with God under every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, proſperous or adverſe; walking humbly with him, and with a perfect heart before him, as the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty &amp; alſufficient God. For as he once ſaid to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> ſo does he to every <hi>ſon of Abraham</hi> by faith, Gen. 17.1. <hi>I am God Almighty, walk before me and be thou perfect, and I will make my covenant between me and the:</hi> And again, Gen. 15.1. <hi>Fear not, Abraham, I am thy ſhield and thy exceeding great reward.</hi>

               <p>WHEREFORE, commit thy ſelf to his Providence and Grace, as thou entereſt on, and paſſeſt thro' an evil world of ſin and trouble; beg his divine preſence with thee; truſt in his grace, hope in his mercy, and keep his way, that he may keep thee thro' the world, keep thee from the evil.

               <p>THE God of <hi>Jacob</hi> will be the God of every praying <hi>Jabez,</hi> and give him his requeſt: 1 Chron. 4.10. <hi>And Jabez called upon the God of Iſrael, ſaying, O that thou wouldeſt bleſs me indeed, and enlarge my coaſt, and that thy hand may be with me, and that thou wouldeſt keep me from evil.</hi> Thus implore and confide in the preſence of a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God, depend on it, aſcribe to it, for thou art not at all ſufficient for thy ſelf.</p>

               <p>THIS is the life and ſpirit of my Text, If God will be with me, <hi>and will give me bread to eat, and raiment to put on, ſo that I come again to my father's houſe in peace</hi> How <hi>good</hi> is God to his Children, that he gives them leave as it were to <hi>indent</hi> with him! <hi>Our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father knows that we have need of theſe things.</hi> But then how <hi>devoted</hi> ſhould we be, and that wholly, to his will and glory! how <hi>abstracted</hi> from the things of this life, and <hi>intent</hi> upon the ſpiritual and eternal bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of that to come; knowing that in heaven we have a better and enduring ſubſtance.

               <p>HERE then, <hi>I. You may bring the tempoval mercies, which you are in the honeſt and lawful purſuit of, into your vows to God upon particular Occaſions.</hi> The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

It was <hi>as when a ſon asks bread of his father;</hi> and ſhall he not give it? So <hi>Jephtha</hi> vow'd to God, if he would give him <hi>Victory</hi> over his Enemies. And when <hi>Arad</hi> the <hi>Canaanite</hi> came out againſt <hi>Iſrael, Iſrael vowed to the Lord and ſaid, If thou wilt deliver this people into my band, I will utterly deſtroy their cities.</hi> And to name no more, <hi>Hannah</hi> being in carneſt prayer for a <hi>Son,</hi> vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Lord, and ſaid, <hi>O Lord of Hoſts, if thou wilt indeed look upon my affliction.</hi> Theſe are great liberties and <hi>freedoms</hi> indulg'd us by a gracious God, which we muſt uſe with great <hi>caution</hi> and wiſdom; for it is eaſie to <hi>err</hi> in them. Wherefore,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>IT muſt be with a moderation of deſire after the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral bleſſings, and a ſubmiſſion of our wills to God with reſpect to them, that we may bring them into our vows to God, when we are in the purſuit of them.</hi> Indeed <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah</hi>'s deſire after a Son ſeems not to have been with all that moderation which one would chuſe and praiſe; yet her <hi>zeal for God's honour and ſervice</hi> in the midſt of her tears for a child is obvious to obſerve, and her <hi>entire ſubmiſſion</hi> of the thing to God, <hi>O Lord of Hoſts if thou wilt indeed.</hi> But the moderation of <hi>Jacob's</hi> wiſhes after a worldly Eſtate is more illuſtrious in my Text.
