            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>We need not ſpend much Time to ſhew, that the Lord of Hoſts, the Mighty God of War, is concern'd to defend the righteous Cauſe, and to arm his Power againſt the rebellious. All ſovereign Power, we know, is immediately derived from him; by Commiſſion from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Many of the <hi>Scottiſh Rebels,</hi> we humbly hope (without any Breach of Chriſtian Charity) are convinced before this Time, of the pernicious Conſequences of unſtable Principles: They have been taken in the Devices they imagined, and have had the Reward of their Deſerts. Surely ſuch Wretches muſt have been addicted to change with a Vengeance, who could prevail upon themſelves to join the Inhabitants of <hi>Babylon,</hi> to raſe the Walls of their own <hi>Sion,</hi> to conſpire and rebel againſt a Prince, who is a Defender of the Faith they profeſs, and to join with one who by the Principles of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is under the moſt ſolemn Obligations to deſtroy it. But this requires a more particular Conſideration.</p>
            <p>Now, what can be more aſtoniſhing? How could ſuch a Relation ever obtain Credit, were it not verified in Fact, that any of our Fellow Subjects ſhould be given over to ſuch Infatuation; tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> ſhould have ſo little Regard either to his Religion or the Welfare of his native Country, as upon any Account whatſoever, to favour and encourage the Introduction of <hi>Popery,</hi> and the bringing over a <hi>French Army</hi> to ſubdue and enſlave it? Oh! <hi>tell it not in Goth, publiſh it not in the Streets of Aſkalon!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however, ſuch it ſeems there are Many; Many who have dared to lift up their treacherous Hands againſt that very <hi>Crown</hi> they had ſworn to ſupport upon his Majeſty's Head, and to ſet up the <hi>Standard</hi> of that <hi>Pretender</hi> whom they had frequently and ſolemnly abjured: Many who have been audacious enough to proclaim the Title of their <hi>ſham Prince,</hi> with thoſe very Tongues with which they had often ſworn, that he had no Right or Title whatſoever to the Imperial Crown of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and with which they had imprecated the Divine Vengeance upon their own Heads, if they did not act ſincerely. Can ſuch Monſters as theſe hope for Succeſs? What do they take the Almighty to be? Think they that he can be impoſed upon with broken Vows and Perjury? Can ſuch be delivered? Oh, no! God has declared himſelf a jealous God, a God that will not hold them Guiltleſs that take his Name in vain.—But let us pauſe and conſider, what Arguments can be framed, what Excuſes or Pretences made for this unnatural Rebellion, this turning our Mother Country into a Scene of Confuſion and Blood. Can his Majeſty's Right and Title be diſputed? Is not his Claim as good a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And has not this Title been recognized in moſt ſolemn Prayers and Thankſgivings to Almighty God, when Men could not prevaricate without the vileſt Hypocriſy? I know there has a Noiſe been made about indefeaſible hereditary Right, and the like; but the Advocates for that Scheme have not duly conſidered, that <hi>that</hi> Doctrine will invalidate the Right of any Prince upon Earth; for upon their Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, there can be but one Perſon in the Univerſe, that has any Right to be a King, and he muſt prove himſelf deſcended in a right Line from the eldeſt Son of <hi>Noah,</hi> the Conſequence of which muſt be Diſorder, Anarchy, Confuſion.</p>
            <p>But, this Hypotheſis will appear altogether whimſical, whether we conſult the Laws of God, or the Laws and Cuſtoms of our own Country. If we conſult the Scriptures, we ſhall there find <hi>David,</hi> who was of another Tribe and Family, ſucceeding <hi>Saul; Solomon</hi> ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <hi>David,</hi> in Preference to his elder Brother; and <hi>Jehoahaz</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to <hi>Jehoiakim;</hi> with many other Inſtances. If we conſult the Laws and Cuſtoms of our own Country, we ſhall find, that from <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> to his preſent Majeſty King GEORGE, (in which Time we have a Succeſſion of thirty and one Kings and Queens) we have not had above four, who have ſucceeded one another in (what is called) <hi>the right Line;</hi> and we ſhall there likewiſe find, that in the Reigns of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> it was enacted High Treaſon to queſtion the Power of Queen and Parliament to limit and bind the Crown, and the Deſcent and Inheritance thereof. Theſe Authorities ſhew (beyond all Contradiction) that his Majeſty's Title to the Crown of his Realms is conſiſtent with, and eſtabliſh'd both by the Laws of God, and the Laws and Cuſtoms of the Land.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>ſecondly.</hi> May not his Majeſty have exerciſed ſome Acts of Tyranny and arbitrary Power? May he not have made his Will the Meaſure of his Actions, and govern'd by Luſt, Prejudice or Fancy? How the Subject is to ſeek for Relief in ſuch difficult Circumſtances as theſe, is not my Buſineſs to determine: But this we are certain of, that nothing of this Sort can be objected againſt our Sovereign, by the moſt audacious and inſolent of thoſe Rebels that are, or have been in Arms againſt him.

            <p>The <hi>Curſe of God,</hi> ſays the Prophet <hi>Zechariah, ſhall enter into the Houſe of him that ſweareth falſly by my Name; and it ſhall remain in the midſt of his Houſe, and ſhall conſume it, with the Timber thereof, and with the Stones thereof.</hi> 5. C. 4. v. It is really melancholy, to ſee any of our Countrymen thus expoſe themſelves to the Curſe of God: But however, it is Matter of ſome Conſolation, that this Curſe will attend the Cauſe they have eſpouſed; will be a dead Weight upon it, and finally ſink it. Oh! may we never then entertain a Thought of ſuch Perfidiouſneſs and Perjury; but in all Reſpects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have ourſelves in a loyal and dutiful Manner to our gracious King, as our Church inſtructs and obliges us. The next great Duty to Piety to God, is Loyalty to our Prince, as God's Vicegerent and Miniſter. What Preſumption then does it argue in Men, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to promote Religion by Sedition and Rebellion? It may as well be done by curſing, ſwearing and Debauchery. He that pretends Religion for an Excuſe for rebelling, has loſt what he contends for, before he begins the Conteſt. For how can any Man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Let us then, <hi>my beloved,</hi> ſhew that we <hi>fear God,</hi> by <hi>honouring the King,</hi> and <hi>medling not with them that are given unto change.</hi> This is the Language of <hi>Scripture,</hi> this is the Doctrine of our <hi>Church,</hi> the very ſame that was taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, free from <hi>Popiſh</hi> or <hi>Fanatical</hi> Corruptions and Additions.</p>
