            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Many of the <hi>Scotti≈øh Rebels,</hi> we humbly hope (without any Breach of Chri≈øtian Charity) are convinced before this Time, of the pernicious Con≈øequences of un≈øtable Principles: They have been taken in the Devices they imagined, and have had the Reward of their De≈øerts. Surely ≈øuch Wretches mu≈øt have been addicted to change with a Vengeance, who could prevail upon them≈øelves to join the Inhabitants of <hi>Babylon,</hi> to ra≈øe the Walls of their own <hi>Sion,</hi> to con≈øpire and rebel again≈øt a Prince, who is a Defender of the Faith they profe≈øs, and to join with one who by the Principles of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is under the mo≈øt ≈øolemn Obligations to de≈øtroy it. But this requires a more particular Con≈øideration.</p>
            <p>Now, what can be more a≈øtoni≈øhing? How could ≈øuch a Relation ever obtain Credit, were it not verified in Fact, that any of our Fellow Subjects ≈øhould be given over to ≈øuch Infatuation; tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Oh! <hi>tell it not in Goth, publi≈øh it not in the Streets of A≈økalon!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But however, ≈øuch it ≈øeems there are Many; Many who have dared to lift up their treacherous Hands again≈øt that very <hi>Crown</hi> they had ≈øworn to ≈øupport upon his Maje≈øty's Head, and to ≈øet up the <hi>Standard</hi> of that <hi>Pretender</hi> whom they had frequently and ≈øolemnly abjured: Many who have been audacious enough to proclaim the Title of their <hi>≈øham Prince,</hi> with tho≈øe very Tongues with which they had often ≈øworn, that he had no Right or Title what≈øoever to the Imperial Crown of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and with which they had imprecated the Divine Vengeance upon their own Heads, if they did not act ≈øincerely.

I know there has a Noi≈øe been made about indefea≈øible hereditary Right, and the like; but the Advocates for that Scheme have not duly con≈øidered, that <hi>that</hi> Doctrine will invalidate the Right of any Prince upon Earth; for upon their Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothe≈øis, there can be but one Per≈øon in the Univer≈øe, that has any Right to be a King, and he mu≈øt prove him≈øelf de≈øcended in a right Line from the elde≈øt Son of <hi>Noah,</hi> the Con≈øequence of which mu≈øt be Di≈øorder, Anarchy, Confu≈øion.</p>
            <p>But, this Hypothe≈øis will appear altogether whim≈øical, whether we con≈øult the Laws of God, or the Laws and Cu≈øtoms of our own Country.

If we con≈øult the Laws and Cu≈øtoms of our own Country, we ≈øhall find, that from <hi>William the Conqueror,</hi> to his pre≈øent Maje≈øty King GEORGE, (in which Time we have a Succe≈ø≈øion of thirty and one Kings and Queens) we have not had above four, who have ≈øucceeded one another in (what is called) <hi>the right Line;</hi> and we ≈øhall there likewi≈øe find, that in the Reigns of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> it was enacted High Trea≈øon to que≈øtion the Power of Queen and Parliament to limit and bind the Crown, and the De≈øcent and Inheritance thereof. The≈øe Authorities ≈øhew (beyond all Contradiction) that his Maje≈øty's Title to the Crown of his Realms is con≈øi≈øtent with, and e≈øtabli≈øh'd both by the Laws of God, and the Laws and Cu≈øtoms of the Land.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>≈øecondly.</hi> May not his Maje≈øty have exerci≈øed ≈øome Acts of Tyranny and arbitrary Power?
