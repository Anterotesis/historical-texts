            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>EVERY Engliſhman muſt deplore the ill ſucceſs, and abhor the unworthy treatment which attended the two late conciliatory plans in relation to America. Pregnant with good ſenſe, benevolence, and ſound reaſon, they will do eternal honor to the wiſdom, juſtice, policy, and humanity of the heads and hearts that formed them. How different was the plan of North. Crafty, mean, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidious, impolitic, irrational, ſhallow, and (like himſelf and his coadjutors) beneath contempt. This was not treating with America, but inſulting her, every ſtep againſt her hitherto has been found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the greateſt inhumanity, the groſſeſt ignorance, and the worſt policy. I will proceed to prove my aſſertions, and defy the whole cabal of miniſterial ſlaughtermen to confute me. I do not call upon the maſter-butcher, becauſe he can only be conſidered
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:013977_0002_0F925A47FAF304C8"/>(after the part he has acted by aſſerting) an executive, and not as a rational maſter in this buſineſs.—Firſt then, for the humanity of theſe proceedings, let it be granted only, as it muſt, that the crown ſtands in the ſame relation to America as a parent to her child, and my firſt aſſertion proves itſelf. Have any gentle, tender, ſenſible means been uſed to reconcile her? Have not her humble remonſtrances, propoſals, ſubmiſſions and ſupplications, been treated with contempt? Not ſuffered to lie upon the table of a Britiſh Houſe of Commons? Have they been deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worthy of a thought by her pious Sovereign? Has ſhe not been branded with the ignominious name of rebel by act of Parliament, for no other reaſon (I mean no true one) than becauſe ſhe has wiſely and calmly diliberated upon, remonſtrated againſt, and ſteadily, but not tumultuouſly, reſented the repeated injuries ſhe has received? As to riots by mobs, they are not to be imputed to her as treaſon and rebellion. America (as a nation moſt unconſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally oppreſſed) has hitherto only deliberated upon her ſufferings. She has not acted. My Lords Suffolk, Pomfret, Radnor, Apſley, Sandwich, they have not acted. It is as yet no treaſon, my Lords, to think, to adviſe, to fear, and to prepare. You cannot, you dare not, move to annul (as you may wiſh) the ſtatute of treaſons in America. The Americans have as good a right to that as your Lordſhips. I mean as yet, my Lords, becauſe I am not quite ſatisfied that (even in the preſent ſmuggled and corrupt Parliament) the boldeſt and moſt venal proſtitute durſt make ſo dangerous a trial upon the patience and long ſufferance, of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. I will now inform your Lordſhips that it is contrary to the law of nations to attempt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction even of the moſt inveterate enemy by
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:013977_0003_0F925A48CA71E3A0"/>famine, until he has been firſt ſolemnly ſummoned to ſubmit. Have the Americans ever yet been (though if men they ſhortly will be) in arms? Have they yet had a proſpect of any other terms than ſuch as would make them ſlaves? Will they be weak enough to ſubmit to ſuch conditions? The prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, hitherto propoſed, have been founded in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, not in reaſon; they are fit for brutes, not men. The lenient, the compaſſionate North has treated America like the aſſaſſin of an alley, with his knife at her throat he has humanely left it at her choice to ſtrip herſelf for fear ſhe ſhould be ſtripped by him. Why have the miniſtry had recourſe at firſt to this inhuman ſcheme of famine? They fear the army will relent, when they find they muſt wade through the Hood of their own countrymen. Their preſent General (Gage) has, to his honor, declined the bloody taſk. Even a foreigner, to whom the ſame command was offered, has revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at the thought. Is not this ſtratagem of ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freemen into ſlavery the moſt inhuman, as well as the moſt cowardly of all others, eſpecially when it is conſidered that all the remonſtrances of theſe unhappy ſufferers have been rejected? I ſhould inſult the reader's underſtanding by wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a reply, I therefore come to the next in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient in the American perſecution, ignorance. I muſt firſt remark that ſome of their wiſe Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips were for having Maryland and Virginia (very remote inland countries) prohibited from the fiſhery. Thus far have ſome of the great and ſage coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors of this nation been ignorant even of the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of that part of their fellow creatures, whom they wiſh to involve in the moſt dreadful of all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, famine. But the very ſcheme itſelf is impracticable; theſe wretched people cannot be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:013977_0004_0F925A498EB430D0"/>deſtroyed either by butchery or famine; their numbers are great and formidable; in ſuch a vaſt extent of country their reſources will be endleſs; they are not deſtitute of arms already, and they will be ſupplied with more in ſpite of our vigilant fleet. They have all the materials neceſſary for war in the bowels of their country; they have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, handicraftſmen, manufacturers, and mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nics of all ſorts; cattle of all kinds; fruit of the earth in vaſt abundance; fine ſtreams and rivers; though no doubt adminiſtration (for the ſake of conſiſtency) will give ſtrict orders, and pay highly for the poiſoning of theſe; but that will not eaſily be effected; theſe people in general know the uſe of arms; they have perſeverance, courage, reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and above all (moſt prophetic Lord Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich!) they have virtue, which can never be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. Should our army ſtrike and fail, the hatred enmity and revolt of America is fixed for ever; they never will ſubmit to lick the tyrant hand, which has once been raiſed againſt their liberties, their properties, and their lives. Under the above conſiderations, the preſent ſcheme of government muſt ſeem impracticable; if ſo, or if from ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and reſentment it has been viewed but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, it is the groſſeſt ignorance to purſue it. Should heaven interpoſe on the ſide of juſtice, we ſhall perceive our error too late; but were our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts by ſword or famine ſure of ſucceſs, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is only deſtroying its own vitals.—What then is the policy of this unnatural war? It is like the war between the belly and the other members; the whole ſtate muſt feel its conſequences. Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low North told the Houſe of Commons (for it is his) that the imports from the American Continent were inconſiderable. Now, my Lord, you ought
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:013977_0005_0F925A4DC9C1E108"/>to know (and in honor you ſhould have declared) that the imports of that part of America into our ſugar Colonies were the very life of them; neither planters, nor Negroes, can ſubſiſt without them, particularly in the prohibited, interidicted article of fiſh, which, when ſalted, is their general food. Your Lordſhip, by your war, and your intended famine, has effectually ſtarved and ruined all the paſſive and obedient ſugar Colonies, as well as your declared enemies in America. Thus a moſt valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fiſhery, a conſiderable ſugar trade, and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands (perhaps millions) of innocent and brave lives will be ſacrificed by a narrow minded miniſtry to wicked views, and inſatiable reſentments, in the reign of a Monarch born a Briton! An ancient Pict, or a wild Indian (ſavage in their natures) would bluſh and ſhudder at ſuch proceedings. With the Colonies and trade the revenues muſt ſink. If royal profuſion, and miniſterial corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were to ſink likewiſe, it would be well; but they will ſtill attempt to draw blood from the moſt impoveriſhed veins. The commercial, the landed intereſt, the public bank, at laſt, muſt feel the ſhock. Then, perhaps, when famine threatens at our own doors, the Britiſh lion will be rouſed.—Then (for I will prophecy in my turn) comes a revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, fatal to minions, penſioners, placemen, knaves and tyrants; but happy for the nation, if from the aſhes of all theſe peſts, the rights of ſuffering and inſulted Engliſhmen can be once more eſtabliſhed. We ſhall find it to our coſt, in vain to ſend Engliſh ſoldiers (none but Scotch will do the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) againſt Engliſh breaſts. I am of opinion (let the wiſhes of the miniſtry be what they will) that if every officer who goes upon this aſſaſſination were a Burgoyne, he would be diſappointed of the
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:013977_0006_0F925A4FAC9525A0"/>blood he pants for, his command will be a ſinecure, and his victory a brave and virtuous deſertion. All who deſerved the names of ſoldiers, would throw down their arms, and embrace their gallant and unhappy countrymen. An Engliſh army will not, and a navy cannot, deſtroy the liberties of America; the miniſtry, who wiſh to deceive the nation, are (as they frequently are) deceived themſelves; they cannot execute their plan without extraordinary and ſucceſſive (almoſt perpetual) drafts of forces. Should the patient ſpirit of this kingdom riſe at ſuch a time in arms, and France and Spain add to the horrors of a civil war, even in the midſt of theſe calamities it will be ſome conſolation that the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſers, abettors, and deteſtable heads of theſe dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical meaſures, cannot long eſcape the vengeance of an injured people. CASCA.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding we have given almoſt the uſual quantity of matter already, we cannot here omit, without injury to our readers and the cauſe of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, the ſpirited city remonſtrance which will do immortal honor to the heads and hearts of thoſe who framed it.</p>
            <div type="petition">
               <head>The ADDRESS, REMONSTRANCE and PETITION of the CITY of LONDON.</head>
               <p>"We your Majeſty's dutiful and loyal ſubjects, the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Livery of the city of London, beg leave to approach the throne, and to declare our abhorrence of the meaſures which have been purſued, and are now purſuing, to the oppreſſion of our fellow ſubjects in America. Theſe meaſures are big with all the conſequences which can alarm a free and commercial people. A deep and perhaps a fatal wound to commerce; the ruin of manufactures; the diminution of the revenue, and conſequent increaſe of taxes; the alienation of the Colonies; and the blood of your Majeſty's ſubjects.</p>
               <p>But your petitioners look with leſs horror at the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, than at the purpoſe of thoſe meaſures. Not deceived by the ſpecious artifice of calling deſpotiſm dignity, they plainly perceive that the real purpoſe is—To eſtabliſh arbritrary power over all America.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="unknown:013977_0007_0F925A51034A9338"/>
Your petitioners conceive the liberties of the whole to be inevitably connected with thoſe of every part of an empire founded on the common rights of mankind. They cannot therefore obſerve, without the greateſt concern and alarm, the conſtitution fundamentally violated in any part of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's dominions. They eſteem it an eſſential and unalterable principle of liberty, the ſource and ſecurity of all conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional rights, that no part of the dominion can be taxed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being repreſented. Upon this great leading principle, they moſt ardently wiſh to ſee their fellow ſubjects in America ſecured in what their humble petition to your Majeſty prays for, peace, liberty and ſafety.—Subordination in commerce, under which the Colonies have always cheerfully acquieſced, is, they conceive, all that this country ought in juſtice to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. From this ſubordination ſuch advantages flow, by all the profits of their commerce centering here, as fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate this nation for the expence incurred, to which they alſo contribute in men and money for their defence and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion during a general war; and in their Provincial wars they have manifeſted their readineſs and reſolution to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. To require more of them would, for this reaſon, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate from the juſtice and magnanimity which have been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto the pride and character of this country.</p>
               <p>It is therefore with the deepeſt concern, that we have ſeen the ſacred ſecurity of repreſentation in their aſſemblies wreſted from them; the trial by jury aboliſhed; and the odious pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of exciſe extended to all caſes of revenue; the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary of their houſes laid open to violation at the will and pleaſure of every officer and ſervant in the cuſtoms; the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of juſtice corrupted, by rendering their Judges de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent for their ſeats and ſalaries on the will of the crown; liberty and life rendered precarious by ſubjecting them to be dragged over the ocean, and tried for treaſon or felony here; where the diſtance, making it impoſſible for the moſt guiltleſs to maintain his innocence, muſt deliver him up a victim to miniſterial vengeance; ſoldiers and others in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica have been inſtigated to ſhed the blood of the people, by eſtabliſhing a mode of trial which holds out impunity for ſuch murder; the capital of New-England has been puniſhed with unexempled rigour, untried and unheard, involving the innocent and the ſuſpected in one common and inhuman cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; chartered rights have been taken away, without: any forfeiture proved, in order to deprive the people of every le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal exertion againſt the tyranny of their rulers; the Habeas Corpus act, and trial by Jury, have been ſuppreſſed; and French deſpotic government, with the Roman Catholic religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have been eſtabliſhed by law, over an extenſive part of
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:013977_0008_0F925A51C3316200"/>your Majeſty's dominions in America; dutiful petitions for redreſs of thoſe grievances, from all your Majeſty's American ſubjects, have been fruitleſs.</p>
               <p>To fill up the meaſure of theſe oppreſſions, an army has been ſent to enforce them.</p>
               <p>Superadded to this, meaſures are now planned upon the moſt mercileſs policy of ſtarving our fellow ſubjects into a total ſurrender of their liberties, and an unlimited ſubmiſſion to arbitrary government.</p>
               <p>Theſe grievances have driven your Majeſty's faithful ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to deſpair, and compelled them to have recourſe to that reſiſtance which is juſtified by the great principles of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, actuated by which, at the glorious period of the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, our anceſtors transferred the impartial crown of theſe realms from the Popiſh and tyrannic race of the Stuarts, to the illuſtrious and Proteſtant Houſe of Brunſwick.</p>
               <p>Your petitioners are perſuaded, that theſe meaſures origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the ſecret advice of men who are enemies equally to your Majeſty's title, and to the liberties of your people. That your Majeſty's miniſters carry them into execution by the ſame fatal corruption which has enabled them to wound the peace and violate the conſtitution of this country; thus they poiſon the fountain of public ſecurity, and render that body, which ſhould be the guardian of liberty, a formidable inſtrument of arbitrary power.</p>
               <p>Your petitioners do therefore moſt earneſtly beſeech your Majeſty to diſmiſs immediately, and forever, from your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, thoſe miniſters and adviſers, as the firſt ſtep towards a full redreſs of thoſe grievances which alarm and afflict your whole people.
