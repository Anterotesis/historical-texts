            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>YOu English <hi>Mattachusians</hi> all</l>
            <l>Forbear sometime from sleeping,</l>
            <l>Let every one both great and small</l>
            <l>Prepare themselves for weeping.</l>
            <l>For he is gone that was our freind,</l>
            <l>This Tyrant Death hath wrought his end.</l>
            <l>Who was the very Chief among</l>
            <l>The chiefest of our Peers</l>
            <l>Who hath in peace maintain'd us long</l>
            <l>The space of nineteen years,</l>
            <l>And now hee's breathless, lifeless, dead,</l>
            <l>Cold earth is now become his bed.</l>
            <l>The Jews did for their <hi>Moses</hi> weep</l>
            <l>Who was their Gubernator,</l>
            <l>Let us for <hi>Winthrope</hi> do the like,</l>
            <l>Who was our Conservator</l>
            <l>With Lines of gold in Marble stone</l>
            <l>With pens of steel engrave his name</l>
            <l>O let the Muses every one</l>
            <l>In prose and Verse extol his Fame,</l>
            <l>Exceeding far those ancient Sages</l>
            <l>That ruled <hi>Greeks</hi> in former Ages.</l>
            <l>O spightfull Death and also cruel</l>
            <l>Thou hast quite slain <hi>New-Englands</hi> Jewel:</l>
            <l>Shew us vile <hi>Tyrant</hi> if thou can</l>
            <l>Tel where to find out such a man?</l>
            <l>Methinks I hear a spirit breathe</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Non est inventus</hi> here beneath.</l>
            <l>He was (we surely may say this)</l>
            <l>
               <hi>Rara avis in terris,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>Therefore let us give him his due,</l>
            <l>To him is due this stile,</l>
            <l>He was an <hi>Israelite</hi> full true</l>
            <l>Without all fraud or guile.</l>
            <l>Let <hi>Winthrops</hi> name still famous be,</l>
            <l>With us and our Posterity.</l>
            <l>What goods he had he did not spare,</l>
            <l>The Church and Commonwealth</l>
            <l>Had of his Goods the greatest share,</l>
            <l>Kept nothing for himself.</l>
            <l>My tongue, my pen, my rustick art</l>
            <l>Cannot express his true desert.</l>
            <l>The nature of the Pelican</l>
            <l>Read storyes what they say,</l>
            <l>To her I would compare this man</l>
            <l>If lawfully I may.</l>
            <l>To <hi>Moses</hi> meek, to <hi>Abraham,</hi>
            </l>
            <l>To <hi>Joseph</hi> and to <hi>Jonathan.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>He was <hi>New-Englands</hi> Pelican</l>
            <l>
               <hi>New-Englands</hi> Gubernator</l>
            <l>He was <hi>New-Englands Solomon</hi>
            </l>
            <l>
               <hi>New-Englands</hi> Conservator.</l>
            <l>Time and Experience the best tryal,</l>
            <l>These two admit of no denial:</l>
            <l>Let nineteen yeares then witness be</l>
            <l>Of <hi>Wintrops</hi> true sincerity.</l>
            <l>Such gifts of grace from God had he,</l>
            <l>That more than man he seem'd to be.</l>
            <l>But now hee's gone and clad in clay,</l>
            <l>Grim Death hath taken him away.</l>
            <l>Death like a murth'ring Jesuite</l>
            <l>Hath rob'd us of our hearts delight.</l>
            <l>Let's shew our love to him by weeping</l>
            <l>That car'd for us when we say sleeping.</l>
            <l>O that our dry eyes fountains were,</l>
            <l>Our heads a living spring,</l>
            <l>O that our sighs the clouds could tear,</l>
            <l>And make an eccho ring:</l>
            <l>Let us sit down in sorrow fel,</l>
            <l>And now with tears ring out his knel.</l>
            <l>Bright shining <hi>Phoebus</hi> hide thy face</l>
            <l>Let misty clouds make dark thy sky,</l>
            <l>Fair <hi>Cynthia</hi> count it no disgrace</l>
            <l>To aid us with thy weeping eye.</l>
            <l>O weep with us for <hi>Joshua</hi>
            </l>
            <l>The Loadstone of <hi>America.</hi>
            </l>
            <l>My sences they are all too weak</l>
            <l>His praises due to write or speak</l>
            <l>Now I must leave it to their skill</l>
            <l>Who can endite and write at will.</l>
            <l>
               <hi>New-England</hi> thou hast cause to mourn,</l>
            <l>For that thy special friend is gone.</l>
            <l>Yet see you mourn with moderation,</l>
            <l>No cause you have of Desparation,</l>
            <l>They yet survive who may renew</l>
            <l>Decay'd and dying hopes in you</l>
            <l>With honour due let us respect them,</l>
            <l>No cause we have for to reject them,</l>
            <l>They are to us as true Directors</l>
            <l>And under God our chief Protectors.</l>
            <l>Here you have <hi>Lowells</hi> loyalty,</l>
            <l>Pend with his slender skill</l>
            <l>And with it no good poetry,</l>
            <l>Yet certainly good will.</l>
            <l>Read these few verses willingly,</l>
            <l>And view them not with <hi>Momus</hi> eye,</l>
            <l>Friendly correct what is amiss,</l>
            <l>Accept his love that did write this.</l>
