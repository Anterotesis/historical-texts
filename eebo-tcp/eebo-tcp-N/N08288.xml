            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>But as in moſt Caſes, thoſe who proſeſs a Scheme, eſpecially if they be ſuch as look upon themſelves as of the foremoſt Rank, don't care to ſee or hear of any Thing, which they apprehend will diminiſh or leſſen the Credit of their Propoſals, wherefore divers of thoſe that had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken the Schiſm, neglecting no Opportunity of cultivating their Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Propoſals, were very induſtrious in urging their own Opinions, and there it reaſon to believe, being Conſcious, that whoſoever read and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the aforeſaid Chriſtian Duty, muſt be of Opinion, that to d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

is more Publick; yet nevertheleſs by their Vigilance, Induſtry, and boldly appointing, and as rejolutely purſuing their Scheme, divers weak People have been drawn into a Compliance in Part of their Notions; and others there are who are, as may be term'd, Lukewarm in thoſe Caſes, and rather than contend, will hold their Peace, whereby thoſe that have undertaken thus to uſurp the Authority of introducing new Mattters and Forms, have ſo far encouraged themſelves, as in Effect to preſume an Alteration in the civil Government Affairs.</p>
            <p>Oh! I wiſh this may be well conſidered; its not my deſign to write my Sentiments on this Subject at this Time, but cannot help obſerving that it ſeems a moſt unhappy Time: Well, under the Conſideration of thoſe Things, and for the good Will and Eſteem I have bad, and ſtill retain for thoſe People, and the many ineſtimable Priviledges we have enjoyed in this Province, owing chiefly to the happy Conſtitution and good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, I wiſh we may ſufficiently Prize it.</p>
            <p>Well, as divers Friends have wrote ſufficiently clear, both in reſpect of Government, and in regard of Cuſtoms and Tribute, I have taken the pains to collect ſome few out of ſuch unexceptionable Authors, and I flatter myſelf you will not think your Time ill ſpent, in comparing their Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with thoſe of the preſent high Profeſſors, and conſider the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and examine whether there is not ſome Inconſiſtencies, and ſee whether you can reconcile the Matters; if not, which muſt be received, and which rejected, for I would not that any People ſhould be ſo unſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in Matters of Faith, as to be ready to follow every new Opinion let it come under ever ſuch a ſanctified Appellation, remembring the Words of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> in that Caſe.</p>
            <p>If the Profeſſors of that Society, will candily conſider the following Collection, and govern themſelves accordingly, it will I preſume redound to their Peace of Mind, and Satisfaction of the Publick, and be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Recompenſe to a Friend and Wellwiſher of this once happy Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Mankind in General.</p>

                  </gap>t us as a religious Society, and moſt deeply ſo at hearing that ſome Friends in <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> aſſert, that they cannot, for Conſcience Sake pay the preſent Tax; I take the Freedom to commit ſome Thoughts to Writing on the Subject, which thou may (if thou thinkeſt thee may be of any Service in it) communicate to ſome who are ſaid to be the Leaders in that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, for ſeveral of whom I have a moſt ſincere Regard. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade myſelf neither thou nor they will expect a finiſhed Eſſay, where the Intention is ſimple and honeſt. A few Miſtakes (if ſuch ſhould appear) will, by the Candid, meet with a favourable Conſtruction. Truth will bear the Teſt of a few and impartial En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirers; and thoſe who ſeek it ſincerely will be pleaſed to meet with any Objections which carry Light and Information in them. And as on one Hand all ſitting and due Regard ought to be paid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious Scruples, ſo on the other Hand, the utmoſt Care ſhould be taken, that nothing is received in the Church as a Matter of Faith and Practice, or be approved by the Society as ſuch, without proper Evidence and Demonſtration; otherwiſe the Church or Community may eſpouſe Articles of Faith which cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, neither the Members be able to render a Reaſon of the Hope that is in them.</p>
               <p>The firſt Law was for raiſing 55000 £. for the King's Uſe; the next, for the further Sum of 100,000 £ for the ſame Uſe: But let it firſt be conſiderd, what can be advanced as ſufficient Reaſons for us to pay all Taxes for the Support of Government, and then the Objections that are made to theſe.</p>
               <p>The firſt in Courſe is that in <hi>Mat.</hi> xxii. 17. and <hi>Mark</hi> xii. 14. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> a memorable Paſſage related by ſeveral of the Evangeliſts when the <hi>Herodians</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> joined in putting the Queſtion to our Lord, What thinkeſt thou? is it lawful to give Tribute un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Caeſar</hi> or not? It appears from the Account that <hi>Joſephus</hi> gives of the State of the Jews at that Time, that thoſe two Parties, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rodians</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> included almoſt the whole Nation; one of them alledged, that they were forbid by God to acknowledge any Sovereign Power but God only; and that it would be therefore very wrong in them to pay Tribute to an Heathen Emperor: The
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:010583_0005_0F80F1CB07B01BF0"/>
other Party alledged, that as they were brought under the <hi>Roman,</hi> Yoke, it would be the wiſeſt Courſe they could take to ſubmit pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently thereto. This religious Diſpute ran very high with them on their putting the aforeſaid Queſtion to our Lord. He bid them ſhew him the Tribute Money, and aſked whoſe Image and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription it had? They ſay unto him Caeſar's. Then faith he unto them, Render unto Caeſar the Things that are Caeſar's, and unto God the Things that are God's. That this was clearly the Will of our Lord, appears by his own Practice when at Capernaum, where he wrought a Miracle to enable <hi>Peter</hi> to pay Tribute for them both, and giveth a weighty Reaſon, left we ſhould offend them. And that the Apoſtles, immediate Followers of our Lord, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood this indiſputably to be his Mind, appears from their being uniformly in the ſame Practice; for there is not (or I have not met with) one Inſtance of their being charged with the contrary: And the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> in the 13th Chapter of <hi>Romans,</hi> is very clear in ſeveral Verſes, particularly the 6th, "For this Cauſe pay we Tribute." Heretofore the Example and Precepts of our Lord have appeared ſo ſtrong, that I ſhould not have ſcrupled, ſaying with the Apoſtle, "If any Man teach otherwiſe, and conſent not to wholeſome Words, even the Words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, he is proud, knowing nothing, but doating about Queſtions and Strifs of Words, <hi>&amp;c."</hi> But as I believe ſome concerned in the preſent Matter are deſirous of diſcharging a good Conſcience, I ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently deſire to treat them with Gentleneſs. It is well known to all who are acquainted with the <hi>Roman</hi> Hiſtory, that the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to which our Lord paid Tribute was a military Government, with indeed all that was left of the civil Power, which was but a Shadow included in one Seaſon, for it was an uſurped abſolute Monarchy at that Time, poſſeſſed by <hi>Tiberius,</hi> one of the moſt wicked Men that ever reigned.—But let us come to our Brethrens Objections. The Goſpel Diſpenſation, ſay ſome, was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, the Son of God not being offered up, and therefore his paying Taxes may be anſwered as fulfilling the Law, or being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the legal Diſpenſation. If it be conſidered, that the Tribute was paid to an Heathen, and that no ſuch Payment was never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived by the Law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> our Lord's Conduct cannot, with any Propriety, be underſtood to fullfil the Righteouſneſs of the Law, becauſe, in this Inſtance, it was no ways relative thereto. Our ancient Friends, thoſe Glorious Sons of the Morning, in <hi>London,</hi> have, from time to time, frequently publiſhed to the World, That they were a People that freely pay all Taxes for the Support of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and uſually, in Addreſſes to the King, or Applications to the Parliament, have ſet Faith out chearfully, paying their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Cuſtom, and Taxes to the Crown, by which, having demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated their Loyalty and Subjection, thought themſelves intitled to the Indulgence and protection of the Crown. It hath been ſaid, that Friends in <hi>England</hi> refuſed to pay Trophy Money, and that the

               <p>That it is not a Publick Tax for the ſupport of Government is clear, no Account is ever rendered thereof to the King's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, nor the Parliament; it is not paid into the Treaſury, nor raiſed annually in the Nation, but in particular Places as Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may require, and relates to the <hi>Militia</hi> only.—But to proceed with our Bretherns Objections, when the Matter was under Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, at the Time an Epiſtle on the Subject was Signed by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Friends, it was urged as the Principal Inducement to that Step, by thoſe who had the greateſt Weight in that Conference, that the Members of our Society were a Majority in the Aſſembly, and ought not to have voted Money for Warlike Purpoſes, but to have ſtood firm to the Teſtimony, and not deviate therefrom; and our freely paying that Tax would be joining with them in that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: This had great Weight with Friends on that Occaſion, who had been long pained in Mind, on Account of the Conduct of ſome Friends in the Aſſembly; but is it not evident that this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt paying the firſt Tax is removed, reſpecting the ſecond, <hi>viz.</hi> a Majority of our Profeſſion in the Aſſembly, and the laſt being laid by other People; and tho' it may be called a Supplement, or Graft on the old R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ot, yet that Supplement or Craft was not made by thoſe who profeſs with us, nor can it be proved that the firſt was a Cauſe of, or produced the ſecond; there being no Room to ſuppoſe; but the late Money Bill would have paſſed, had there been none before, the Crown having demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Proviſion ſhould be made, for the defence of the Province.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010583_0007_0F80F1D1F8BBF0E8"/>
The Appropriating any Part of this Money, by thoſe who are intruſted with it, to Purpoſes we do not approve of, cannot I think be inſiſted on as an Argument againſt our paying it, at leaſt not by thoſe who allow the Example of our Lord and his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to be of any Weight. They did not, that we have any Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of at all, enquire into the Uſes, which the Governor would make of their Money; and it never can be applied to worſe Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes than was common in thoſe Governments. If it be granted (as it readily will) that the Legiſlator have Power to levy Taxes, or alienate a Part of the Eſtate of the Subjects to the Uſe and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of the Crown; and when they have ſo done, Is not ſo much Caeſars Due, or Right, and the legal Property of the Crown? the Subject ſays no, it is yet his. Does not the Subject who ſo refuſes, depart from his Allegiance, and deny Subjection, contrary to the Apoſtolick Injunction? But to this may be objected, we don't pay Tythes, and they are enjoined by Law. Tythes were origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſaid to be given to God, and the Holy Church, not by ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, but by eccleſiaſtick Power, and were claimed as due by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Right, and are for the ſupport of an Antichriſtian Miniſtry, and were afterwards only confirmed by Law; they were not given to Caeſar nor claimed by him, being deem'd to relate to Spiritual Things; and as Spiritual Things, or Matters relating to the Church of Chriſt, are not in the Power of the civil Magiſtrates, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain to God only, ſo there is no Parity between the Payment of Taxes for the Support of Government, and the Payment of Tythes for the Support of an Hireling Miniſter: by the firſt we comply with what is in the Power of the civil Magiſtrates to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join as God's Miniſters, but a Compliance with the latter, would be to give him God's Due, which is Addoration and Worſhip; and Caeſar is not to have them both, but one only, <hi>viz.</hi> his Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, his Tribute. Thus we may render to Caeſar the Things that are Caeſars, and unto God the Things that are God's. Seeing then all outward Evidence, both Precept and Example, favour the Payment of Taxes, for the Support of Government, upon what Foundation can the Scruple ariſe? Why, ſay ſome, we are not eaſy to pay the Preſent Tax: We ſhould bring a Load on our Minds if we did; and we apprehend we have a Revelation of ſome Things more than has heretofore been diſcovered, or a Call to bear a clearer Teſtimony againſt War than was ever yet Done. But would it not be Prudent in theſe Friends to conſider, that as this Manner of Scrupling is not warranted by Scripture Reaſon, nor the Practice of the faithful in all Ages, it calls for a ſerious Re-conſideration, in what Manner their Miſſion can be proved. New Revelation, if it be received by others, muſt carry new Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and very ſtrong Ones theſe ought to be to convince ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Minds, that they may ſafely leave the Example of their Lord and Maſter, and act directly contrary thereto: And may not, by the ſame Means now propoſed, I mean Pretences to further Light,

the moſt abſurd Opinions be introduced into the Society, as Articles of Faith, if the Precept and Practice of Chriſt, and his immediate followers, and our worthy Elders, are not to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as ſufficient Bars to ſuch Pretences.</p>
               <p>My Deſires are ſo earneſt, that what I look upon as an Extream in thoſe our Brethren may be ſtoped, that it occaſions much Matter to flow into my Mind, to offer to their Conſideration; but Time at Preſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And Oh! that I could hope there may never be Occaſion to ſay more on the Subject; but however that may be, I cannot conclude without this Remark, Ought, or is it conſiſtent for any Member of our Society to embrace any Thing, or practice any Scruple, whereby the whole Body may be affected, without firſt conſulting, or having the concurrent Sentiment of their Brethren in Society, (I mean the whole Society) as we are one People, and profeſs one Univerſal Spirit the World over? May not a Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, contrary to this, by a Perſon in the Society, under any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences whatſoever, promote Independency, and introduce Anarchy, whereby the Body may be ſplit into Parties; which is contrary to the true Nature and End of the Society.</p>

In the mean Time came the Czar and the other to us; the other I ſuppoſe was Prince <hi>Menzicoff,</hi> his General; our Backs were towards them, and our Hats on, and when they approached, the Perſon with whom we had converſed looked down upon the Floor with profound Reſpect and Silence, but we ſtood in our firſt Poſture, with our Faces towards the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, as if we had not taken any Notice of them; the Perſon we had converſed with was an Engliſhman, a <hi>Muſcovy</hi> Merchant, known to the Czar in his own Country, underſtood his language, and was his Interpreter: Then the Czar ſpoke ſomething to him which we did not underſtand, upon which he aſked us why do you not pay reſpect to great Perſons when you are in their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence? I anſwered, ſo we do, when we are fully ſenſible of it, eſpecially to Kings and Princes; for though we have laid aſide and decline all vain and empty Shews of reſpect and Duty, and flattering Titles, whereby they are generally deceived, by inſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere and deſigning Men, who ſeem to admire them for their own Ends; yet we yield all due and ſincere Reſpect and Duty to ſuch, and all in Authority under them, by giving ready Obedience to all their lawful Commands: But when at any Time any of them, either through Tyranny or Ignorance, or ill Counſel, happens to Command any Thing contrary to our Duty to the Almighty, or his Chriſt our Lord; then we offer our Prayers and Tears to God, and humble Addreſſes unto ſuch Rulers that their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings may be opened, and their Minds changed towards us.</p>
               <p>The Czar gave no reply to this, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For could Friends obtain the ſame in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and other Places, they would willingly have done it, and did proffer themſelves for to do it to the Governors; but becauſe that they would not bring Swords and Guns, and other Arms, to watch againſt the Spaniards as they pretended, their ſtanding Fine was about Seventeen Shillings each Man's Neglect, but they took of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Thirty Shillings Worth for it, and tied ſome of them Neck and Heels beſides, till the Blood hath come forth at their Mouths, Noſe and Ears; and this I have ſeen upon Record, who freely proffered to watch in their own Way, but it would not be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and in other Places it hath been the ſame.</p>
               <p>And now, as for watching in itſelf, Don't you watch your Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations againſt Thieves in the Night? And are not common Watches ſet to diſcover Thieves in the Towns, or Houſe-breakers, or ſuch as might wickedly Fire Houſes?

So you are not to be the Revengers, but he is the Revenger; and to that Power that executes the Revenge, and brings the Sword upon the Adulterer, Murderer, Thief, falſe Witneſs, and other evil Doers, we muſt be ſubject to that Power, and own that Power; not only for Wrath, but for Conſcience Sake; which is for the Puniſhment of the evil Doers, and the Praiſe of them that do well. For if any ſhould come to burn your Houſe, or rob you, or come to raviſh your Wives or Daughters, or a Company ſhould come to fire a City or Town, or come to kill Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Don't you watch againſt all ſuch Actions?

And for this Cauſe we pay Tribute to them, and gives Caeſar his Due, that we may live a godly and peaceable Life under them, as they are God's Miniſters, attending upon this very Thing, to wit, the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the evil Doers, and the Praiſe of them that do well; for the Law was not made for the Righteous; but for the Sinner and Diſobedient, which is good in its place.</p>
               <p>Now if they do not do their Duty, we are clear in giving them their Tribute or Cuſtoms; I ſay, if they do not do their Duty to keep down evil Doers, and be for the Praiſe of them that do well, God Almighty will turn againſt them.

Wherefore if you be dead with Chriſt, from the Rudiments of the World, why, as though living in the World, are ye ſubject to Ordinances, touch not, taſte not, handle not, which all are to periſh with the uſing, after the Commandments and Doctrines of Men? Now theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, theſe Doctrines, theſe Commandments, were concerning Religion and Worſhip: And that was another Thing, where the Apoſtle ſaith, be ſubject to every Ordinance of Man, for the Lord's Sake, which was for the Praiſe of them that do well, and for the Puniſhment of the evil Doer. So he makes Diſtinction here. And you know that Maſters of Ships, and Friends have their Watches all Night long; and they watch to preſerve the Ship, and to prevent any Enemy or Hurts that might come to the Ship, by Paſſengers or otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>And Chriſt came in the fourth Watch of the Night, walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the Sea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Peter</hi> was in the Ship, and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as you may ſee i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And then he brings a Compariſon; And this know, that if the good Man of the Houſe, ſaid he, had known, what Hour the Thief would come, he would have watched, and not ſuffered his Houſe to be broken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>. And ſo here is the good Man's watching againſt Sin and Evil without, and the Spoiler and Thief without, whom the Magiſtrate is to revenge, and to lay his Sword upon. And here is alſo a watching againſt Sin and Evil within, and a waiting to receive Chriſt the Lord at his coming.</p>
               <p>And as there is a ſhutting the outward Doers, to keep out the Murderers and the Thieves, and a bolting and locking them out; ſo there is a ſhuting up, and locking the Door of the Heart, to keep out the Adulterer and Murderer, and all that is deceitful, from coming within into the Heart.</p>
               <p>And Friends, the Prieſts and Profeſſors uſed to bring this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, "You muſt be ſubject to every Ordinance of Man, for the

Lord's Sake, to the end that we ſhould pay them their Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and hold up their Worſhip.—And when the Magiſtrates brought that Scripture for theſe Ends, we could not obey them in theſe Things, nor touch, nor taſte their Ordinances, Doctrines nor Commandments; but to be ſubject to every Ordinance of Man, for the Lord's Sake, which was for the Puniſhment of evil Doers, as Drunkards, Thieves, Murderers, Adulterers, and ſuch like, and to keep down ſuch evil Doers, and that we might live a godly and peaceable Life under them, which was for the Praiſe of them that do well, this we always owned, and were ſubject to, and watched againſt, and declared againſt in our own Way, and laid ſuch Actors and Actions before the Magiſtrates, for them to puniſh, and keep down with their Power, which is their Sword of Juſtice; but if they would compel us to Things that we could not do, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to our Conſcience, for the Lord's Sake, we ſuffered for it. So where Friends has the Government, as in <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> and that Province, Friends was willing to watch, in their own Way; and they made a Law that none ſhould be compelled to take Arms. So Friends have always proffered the Magiſtrates, though they could not join with them in carrying Arms, Swords and Piſtols; yet to watch in their own Way, againſt the evil Doers.</p>
               <p>And this they have proffered in <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> as I have heard, to diſcover if Negroes ſhould riſe up to burn Plantations, or ſteal, or do any hurt, or other Indians invading their Land.</p>
               <p>And ſo if the Foreign Indians ſhould come to ſteal your Goods, or to kill; for you to be left to your Freedom to watch in your own Way, and to diſcover to the Magiſtrate ſuch as would deſtroy your Lives or Plantations, or ſteal, let them come from at home, or come from abroad, ſuch evil Doers the Magiſtrate is to puniſh, who is for the Praiſe of them that do well; ſo that you may live and lead a godly and peaceable Life under them: And you that are Righteous, your watching, diſcovering and declearing againſt ſuch evil Doers, and Things, you clear yourſelves, and demonſtrate that your Teſtimony is againſt ſuch Things; and if the Magiſtrates ſhould be evily inclined, and God ſhould bring the evil Doers as a Rod upon them, yet you are clear in your Teſtimony, that knows Truth, and are in your Duty, and in your Obedience; and for this Cauſe he has his Tribute, and his Cuſtom, and his Due, and double Honour, if he rules well; and God has his Praiſe and his Honour, and in that Power and Truth of God, which is againſt Untruth and the Power of Darkneſs; and in the Light which is againſt Evil, and in the Life which is againſt Death; you diſcover the bad to him, for him to puniſh them upon true Evidence, and if he does not do it, it will lye upon him. And if he be a Praiſe to the Evil, and a diſcouragement to the Good, then the Lord will deal with him; and tho' to ſuch for Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and for the Lord's Sake, we cannot be ſubject to the evil, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and keeps down the evil, and are glad of it; and we deſire that Juſtice were uppermoſt in all Magiſtrates, that they would hear Friends at their Yea and Nay, that do come to them, and diſcover to them the evil, and that they might ſee what they ſhould do, and what they ſhould not do; ſo Friends may diſcover all that which is evil, which comes to devour and deſtroy, both within and without, both within the <hi>Iſland</hi> and without, to them that ſhould keep it down. And ſo in the Lord's everlaſting Power, in which Freedom is and Dominion, the Lord God Almighty keep you in his Power and Life in the Goſpel, which brings Life and Immortality to Light in you, that you may ſee over the Devil that had darkened you, and kept you in a Seperation from God; ſo that by his Goſpel, the Power of God, which was before the Devil was, and will be when he is gone, who was the Author of Strife, that in that Power you may all freely approach to God, and in it feel nothing betwixt you and the Lord of hindering your Paſſage unto him; ſo that in this Goſpel, the Power of God, in which Life and Immortality is brought to Light, you may keep and feel your Everlaſting Fellowſhip and Order of the Goſpel; which is not of Man nor by Man.</p>
               <p>So with my Love to all Friends in all thoſe Parts, as though I named them; and be at Peace one with another, neither judge one another about ſuch Things, but live in Love, which doth edify. And in the Power of God, that your Hearts and Souls, and Minds may unite together in it, and all to walk as becomes the Goſpel; and let your Lives and Converſations Preach that with a Meaſure of the Spirit of God, you may reach to that of God in all; ſo that his Name may be glorified, and he honoured, in your bringing forth much heavenly Spiritual Fruit, from the heavenly Seed, that Chriſt the heavenly Seed's-man hath ſown in your Hearts; that ſo an hundred fold of Holineſs, Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Godlineſs, Virtue and Piety, from this heavenly Seed you may bring forth and increaſe in this Life time, and in the World <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet when Laws and Statutes were made, requiring certain Conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which for Conſcience Sake could not be complied with, by our faithful Friends; ſome Magiſtrates, inſtead of the Sword of Juſtice, took up the Sword of Perſecution againſt them; Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs they did not reſiſt, but patiently ſuffered the ſpoiling of their Goods, grievous Impriſonments, Scourging and Baniſhment from their tender Families, Friends and Relations, chuſing, as the holy Apoſtles did in the like Caſe, to obey God rather than Men. For they could not but ſpeak the Things which they had ſeen and heard; and for all this cruel Uſage and Sufferings, they paid their Taxes and Tributes, rendering to Caeſar the Things which were his, and to God the Things that were his; for ſo was the Will of God, that with well-doing, they ſhould put to Silence the Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of fooliſh Men.</p>

Secondly, to cherriſh thoſe that do well; which gives Government a Life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Corruption, and makes it as durable in the World as good Men ſhall be; ſo that Government ſeems a Part of Religion itſelf, a Thing ſacred in its Inſtitution and End: For if it does not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly remove the Cauſe, it cruſhes the Effects of Evil, and is as ſuch (though a lower yet) an Emanation of the ſame divine Power, that is both Author and Object of pure Religion; the Difference lying here, that the one is more free and mental, the other more corporeal and compulſive in its Operations; but that is only to evil Doers, Government itſelf being otherwiſe as capable of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Goodneſs and Charity, as a more private Society. They weakly err, that think there is no other Uſe of Government than Correction, which is the coarſeſt Part of it. Daily Experience tells us, that the Care and Regulation of many other Affairs, more ſoft and daily neceſſary, make up much the greateſt Part of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and which muſt have followed the peopling of the World, had <hi>Adam</hi> never fell, and will continue amongſt Men on Earth, under the higheſt Attainments they may arrive at, by the the Coming of the bleſſed Second <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord from Heaven. Thus much of Government in general, as to its Riſe and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

My Reaſons are, Firſt, that the Age is too nice and difficult for it, there being nothing the Wits of Men are more buſy and divided upon. 'Tis true, they ſeem to agree in the End, <hi>to wit,</hi> Happineſs; but in the Means they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, as to divine, ſo to this human Felicity; and the Cauſe is much the ſame, not always want of Light and Knowledge, but want of uſing them rightly. Men ſide with their Paſſions againſt their Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and their ſiniſter Intereſts have ſo ſtrong a Biaſs upon their Minds, that they lean to them againſt the Good of the Things they

know. Secondly, I do not find a Model in the World, that Time, Place, and ſome ſingular Emergencies have not neceſſarily altered; nor is it eaſy to frame a civil Government that ſhall ſerve all Places alike. Thirdly. I know what is ſaid by the ſeveral Admirers of Monarchy, Ariſtocracy and Democracy, which are the Rule of one, a few, and many, and are three common Ideas of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when Men diſcourſe on that Subject. But I chuſe to ſolve the Controverſy with this ſmall Diſtinction, and it belongs to all three. Any Government is free to the People under it (whatever be the Frame) where the Laws Rule, and the People are a Party to thoſe Laws; and more than that is Tyranns, Oligarchy, or Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But, laſtly, When all is ſaid, there is ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Governments, like Clocks, go from the Motion Men give them; and as Governments are made and moved by Men, ſo by them they are ruined too; wherefore Governments rather depend upon Men, than Men upon Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Let Men be good, and the Govern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m: But let them conſider, that tho' good Laws do well, good Men do better; for good Laws may want good Men, but good Men will never want good Laws, nor ſuffer ill Ones. 'Tis true, good Laws have ſome Awe upon ill Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, but that is where they have no Power to eſcape or aboliſh them, and the People are generally wiſe and good; but a looſe and depraved People (which is to the Queſtion) love Laws and an Adminiſtration like themſelves. That, therefore, which makes a good Conſtitution, muſt keep it, <hi>viz.</hi> Men of Wiſdom and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; Qualities that, becauſe they deſcend not with worldly Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritances, muſt be carefully propagated by a virtuous Education of Youth, for which, after Ages will owe more to the Care and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Founders, and the ſucceſſive Magiſtracy, than to their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents for private Patrimonies.</p>
               <p>Theſe Conſiderations of the Weight of Government, and the nice and various Opinions about it, made it uneaſy to me to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the enſuing Frame, and conditional Laws, foreſeeing both the Cenſures they will meet with from Men of differing Humours and Engagements, and the Occaſion they may give of Diſcourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my Deſign.

(An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered) We are ſubject, and for that Cauſe we do pay Taxes, Tribute and Cuſtom, and give unto Caeſar the Things that are his, and unto God the Things that are his, <hi>to wit,</hi> Worſhip <hi>&amp;c."</hi>

               <p>To which may be added two or three Paſſages out of <hi>Arſcotts</hi> Works, Page 251, and 52. "And in Regard we have been favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Government, with the Enjoyment of our religious Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties in common, with other Proteſtant Diſſenters, and in an eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecial Manner relieved, by the Legiſlator in ſeveral Caſes, which peculiarly concerns us as a People, We therefore think ourſelves obliged earneſtly to adviſe all Friends, that they be particularly careful to behave with all Dutifulneſs and Gratitude, and eſpecially to diſcountenance every the leaſt Appearance of indecent Freedom, or Mark of Diſſatisfaction in Word or Writing, relating to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment".</p>
               <p>And in the Epiſtle for 1732, is the following Clauſe, "It is acceptable to us to find by the Accounts from the ſeveral Parts of the Kingdom, that (according to former Exhortation of the Meeting) Friends continue generally careful not to defraud the King of his Cuſtoms, Duties or Exerciſes; and ſo far to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage ſuch Practices, as to avoid dealing in Goods, reaſonably ſuſpected to be run. This is a Care highly commendable, and no doubt very incumbent on every honeſt Subject: But as the Government hath ſignally favoured us in our religious Liberties, we are under the greater Obligation of Gratitude, as well as Duty, to manifeſt that we are as truly Conſciencious to render to Caeſar the Things that are Caeſar's, as to ſupport any other Branch of Chriſtian Teſtimony."</p>
               <p>Alſo in the yearly Meeting Epiſtle for 1733, the Duty is again recommended in theſe Words, "The good Account we have received of Friends Care in general, to keep themſelves clear of defrauding the King, in any of his Cuſtoms, Duties and Exciſe, are very acceptable to us, and we do, as formerly, ſo now again, recommend the Continuance of a Duty ſo neceſſary and incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on every good and faithful Subject, being expreſly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Chriſt himſelf; Render therefore unto Caeſar the Things which are Caeſar's, <hi>Matthew</hi> xxii <hi>Chap. 21 Verſe."</hi>

               <p>And our Friend <hi>Joſeph Beſſe,</hi> in his Defence of Quakeriſm, in anſwer to <hi>Patrick Smith,</hi> Vicar of <hi>Great Paxton,</hi> in Hunterdon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, where he accuſes Friends of holding unreaſonable and ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Principles, highly deſtructive of Government, hath theſe Words, in Page 135.</p>
               <p>"The paying of our Taxes, impoſed by Law, for the Service of Government, is conſiſtent with the Precept of Chriſt, Render unto

Caeſar the Things that are Caeſar's, to which we yield a ready Obedience; nor does it concern us, what Purpoſes Caeſar ſhall apply theſe to; but the Caſe of paying Tythes is quite different, where the Law, as we think, enjoins us to do what Chriſt hath prohibited; therefore, chuſe therein to obey God rather than Man.</p>
               <p>This is a Principle neither unreaſonable nor ſeditious, unleſs the prefering Chriſt's Precepts to Men's Injunctions can merit thoſe Epithets." Again, in Page, 217, anſwers thus, "This Tale has no more Weight than the former. Was not the Government there (meaning <hi>Pennſylvania</hi>) always ſubject to the Government here, from whence they received their Authority? And were they not as Subjects obliged in Duty to ſupply the Government here with ſuch Sums of Money as ſhould be equally laid upon them, for the common Good and Security of the Plantations there? In finding Money therefore for the Service of the Government, they performed but that which all Quakers hold to be their Duty. <hi>viz.</hi> Rendering to Caeſar the Things that are Caeſar's; they muſt then have been very inconſiſtent with themſelves, to have diſown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Man for acting agreeable to their Principles."</p>
               <p>And I think that worthy Miniſter of the Goſpel, <hi>Robert Barclay,</hi> hath theſe Words in Page 486, concerning the Power of the Civil Magiſtrate, in Matters purely religious, and pertaining to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</p>

I ſhall conclude with the Advice of the Apoſtles, "Let all your Things be done with Charity; put on therefore, as the Elect of God, holy and beloved, Bowels of Mercy, Kindneſs, humbleneſs of Mind, Meekneſs, Longſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, forbearing one with another, and forgiving one another, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And above all Things put on Charity, which is the Bond of Perfectneſs; and above all Things nave fervent Charity among yourſelves, for Charity ſhall cover a multitude of Sins.</p>

               <p>Here Chriſt cuts off that Power and Authority which grows up in the corrupt Nature of Man, which was ever and anon ſpringing up even in the Diſciples. Here he wholly excludes it out of his Church, and ſays, expreſly, he would have no ſuch Thing among them; no ſuch Kind of Greatneſs, nor no ſuch Kind of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

               <p>Two Things are here excluded by Chriſt, from whence all the Miſchief ariſeth in the Church (all the Tyranny and Oppreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Men's Conſciences, and of their Perſons, Eſtates and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties for Conſcience Sake) firſt, Greatneſs; ſecondly, the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing Dominion and Authority by thoſe that would be Great therein.</p>

He did not hold forth to them whatever he knew to be Truth, requiring them to believe it, but was content with them in their State, and waited till their Capacities were enlarged, being ſtill ſatisfied with the Honeſty and Integrity of their Hearts in their preſent State of Weakneſs. Nor did he ſtrive to reign over the World, or call for Fire from Heaven, when they would not receive him or expreſs Indignation when they deſired him to depart out of their Coaſts; or pray for twelve Legions of Angels when they came to betray him, and moſt unrighteouſly ſought his Life; but the Life he had received of his Father, he gave up as a Ranſom for his Diſciples, yea, and for his Enemies. Mark, he did not make uſe of what was given to him, to raiſe himſelf up above others, to make his Word to ſtand for a Law, and be received, but he waited till that was opened in his Diſciples, and in People which was able to receive his Teſtimony; and he made uſe of his Power of Life, and the Fulneſs of the Spirit, to enable him the more abundantly to ſerve and to wait in Patience, for the fulfiling of the Will of the Father.

               <p>Thus Chriſt himſelf, though he miniſtered to his Diſciples, yet he alſo was their Lord and Maſter, and in the Spirit and Life of the Father, ruled over them; and thus the Apoſtles and other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt, had likewiſe, in the Spirit, the Care of the Churches, and Authority in the Lord, by his Spirit, to govern the Spirits of his People; not to govern after a fleſhly Manner, by their own Wills; not to preſcribe them in a lordly Way, either what they ſhould believe or practiſe, but in the Light, and in the

When the Spirit moves in any one to ſpeak, the ſame Spirit moves in the other to be ſubject and give way; and ſo every one keeping to his own Meaſure in the Spirit, here can be no Diſorder, but true Subjection of every Spirit; and where this is wanting, it cannot be ſupplyed by any outward Rule, or Order, ſet up in the Church by common Conſent; for that is fleſhly, and lets in the Fleſh, and deſtroys the true Order, Rule and Subjection.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles and Miniſters of Chriſt, come from Chriſt with a Meſſage of Life and Salvation, with a Teſtimony concerning the good Will of God, and his Love to Mankind, pointing out the Way from Death to Life, from Bondage to Liberty, from W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Now, that which they Preach to, is Men's Conſciences in the Sight of God. They open the Truth which they know, they give their Teſtimony in the moving, leading and Power of the Spirit, and they leave it to the ſame Spirit, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o demonſtrate it to Men's Conſciences, as it pleaſeth. They are nothing, they can do nothing, they cannot convert any Man to God; but the Power that ſpeaketh by them, the ſame Power worketh in other Men's Conſciences, at its Pleaſure. And here is the Beginning of the Government of Chriſt in the Heart, when his Truth carries Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction with it to the Conſcience, and the Conſcience is drawn to yield itſelf up to him; then he lays his Yoke upon it, and takes upon him the guiding of it; he cheriſheth it, he cleanſeth it, he comforteth it, he ordereth it at his Pleaſure, and he alone preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it pure, chaſte, gentle, meek and pliable to the Impreſſions of his Spirit; and as the Conſcience is kept ſingle and tender to Chriſt, ſo his Government increaſes therein; but as it becomes
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010583_0029_0F80F1E44D0A7870"/>
hard, or ſubject to Men's Wills, ſo another Spirit gets Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over it.</p>
               <p>Thererefore the great Work of the Miniſter of Chriſt, is to keep the Conſcience open to Chriſt, and to preſerve Men from receiving any Truths of Chriſt's, as from them, further than the Spirit opens, or to imitate any of their Practices, further than the Spirit leads, guides and perſuades them. For Perſons are exceeding prone to receive Things as Truths from thoſe whom they have an high Opinion of, and to imitate their Practices, and ſo hurt their own Growth, and endanger their Souls. For if I receive a Truth before the Lord makes it Manifeſt to me, I loſe my Guide, and follow but the Courſe of the Fleſh, which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding greedy of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>eving Truths, and running into religious Practices without the Spirit; therefore the main Thing in Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, to keep the Conſcience pure to the Lord, to know the Guide, to follow the Guide, to receive from him that Light whereby I am to walk, and not to take Things for Truths, becauſe others ſee them to be Truths, but to wait till the Spirit makes them Manifeſt to me; nor to run into Worſhips, Duties, Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances or Practices, becauſe others are led thither, but to wait till the Spirit lead me thither. He that makes haſte to be rich, even in Religion, running into Knowledge, and into Worſhips and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances before he feel a true and clear Guidance, ſhall not be innocent, nor the Lord will not hold him guiltleſs, when he comes to viſit for ſpiritual Adultery and Idolatry. The Apoſtles were exceeding tender in this Point, for though they certainly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly knew what was to be believed, yet they were not Lords over Mens Faith, but waited till he who is Lord of the Faith, would open the Way into Men's Conſciences. They did not take upon them to be able to turn the Key, to let in Truth and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction into Mens Spirits (as Men in theſe Days have been too apt to undertake) but directed them to him who had the Key, there to wait for the Conviction and Illumination of their Minds, and ſo to receive in as they found him give forth to them.</p>
               <p>Let every Man, ſaith the Apoſtle, be fully perſuaded in his own Mind. Take heed of receiving Things too ſoon, take heed of running into Practices too ſoon, take heed of doing what ye ſee others do, but wait for your own particular Guidance, and for a full Perſuaſion from God what is his Will concerning you; though I know this to be a Truth, yet do not ye receive it, till God make it Manifeſt to you; receive Truth from his Hand; ſtay till he give it you. Indeed the main Matter in Religion, is to keep out the wrong Part, the forward Part, the baſtardly Birth from running into Duties, catching of Op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And ſo the Apoſtle Warns Believers, to take heed of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another on too faſt, or of judging one another in ſuch Tnings as ſome of them might have light in, others not. He that eateth, not to judge him that did not eat; and he that did not eat, not to judge him that did eat. Yea, in Matters of Worſhip, he that obſerved a Day, and kept a Sabbath, not to judge him that obſerved not a Day, or kept not a Sabbath; for the <hi>Jews,</hi> which were truly converted, yet were hard to be drawn off from the Obſervation of their Sabbath, could hardly bear with the believing Gentiles, who were never taught to keep their Sabbath with them, but were taught to eſteem every Day, and ſanctify it to the Lord, <hi>Rom. 14th Chap. 5th Verſe.</hi> And theſe who eſteemed every Day, and dedicated it to the Lord, (ceaſing from Sin, and reſting in him, for under the Goſpel we are not to ſet up a new Type, but to enter by Faith into the true Reſt, which is the Subſtance of wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

lead them on faſt enough, and give them Light faſt enough, for he taketh Care of ſuch, and knoweth what Light and what Practices are moſt proper for them; but for Men to walk on faſter than the Lord holds forth his Light to them, this overturns them, raiſing up a wrong Thing in them, and the true Birth hereby comes to ſuffer, to ſhrink, and be drawn back. And, O! how ſweet and pleaſant is it to the truly ſpinitual Eye; to ſee ſeveral Sorts of Believers, ſeveral Forms of Chriſtians in the School of Chriſt, every one learning their own Leſſon, performing their own pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Service, and knowing, owning, and loving one another in their ſeveral Places, and different Performances to their Maſter, to whom they are to give an Account, and not to quarrel with one another about their different Practices, <hi>Romans</hi> xiv. 4. For this is the true Ground of Love and Unity, not that ſuch a Man walks and does juſt as I do, but becauſe I feel the ſame Spirit and Life in him, and in that he walks in his Rank in his own Order, in his proper Way and Place of Subjection to that; and this is far more pleaſing to me, than if he walked juſt in that Track wherein I walk: Nay, ſo far as I am ſpiritual, I cannot ſo much as deſire tnat he ſhould do ſo, until he be particularly led thereto, by the ſame Spirit which led me. And he that knows what it is to receive any Truths from the Spirit, and to be led by the Spirit, and how prone the fleſhly Part is to make haſte, and how dangerous that haſte is, will not be forward to preſs his Knowledge or Practices upon others, but rather wait patiently till the Lord fit them for the receiving thereof, for fear, leſt they ſhould receive and Practiſe too ſoon, even in that Part which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſerve the Lord. And this I can truly ſay, concerning myſelf, I never found my Spirit forward to draw any, either to any Thing I believed to be true, or to any Practice or Way of Worſnip I obſerved or walked in, but deſired that the Power and Leadings of Life might go before them; and was afraid leſt Men ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Things from my Hand and not from the Lord's. Yea, and this I very well Remember, that when I walked in the Way of Independency (as it hath been commonly called) I had more Unity with, and more Love towards ſuch as were ſingle hearted in other Ways and Practices of Worſhip (whoſe Spirits I had ſome feeling of in the true Simplicity, and in the Life) than with divers of ſuch, who were very knowing and zealous in that Way of Independency, in whom a wrong Thing in the mean time had got up, which had cauſed them to ſwerve from the Life and from the Simplicity.</p>
               <p>So that the true Church Government being in the Spirit, and over the Conſcience, as in the Sight of God, the great Care muſt be to keep it within its Bounds, that nothing elſe govern but the Spirit, and that the Government be extended only unto that which is to be governed.</p>

Every Miniſter in the Church is to watch over his own Spirit, that it intrude not into the Work of God, that it take not upon it to be the Teacher, Exhorter, the Reprover, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And every Member is to wait in that Meaſure of the Spirit which he hath received, to feel the goings ſorth of the Spirit, in him who teacheth and governeth, and ſo to ſubject, not to Man, but to the Lord, to receive from the Lord, to obey the Lord. Not to know any Miniſter, according to the Fleſh, but to receive and ſubmit to what comes from the Spirit, in the Spirit. Not to know <hi>Paul</hi> or <hi>Apollo,</hi> or <hi>Cephas,</hi> but the Spirit miniſtering in them. <hi>Paul</hi> may err; <hi>Apollo</hi> may err; <hi>Peter</hi> may err (And did err, where he compelled the <hi>Gentiles</hi> to live as the <hi>Jews, Gal.</hi> ii. 14.

               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Care muſt be had that the Conſcience be kept tender, that nothing be received but according to the Light in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.

his Burthen with him. O! How ſweet and lovely is it to ſee Brethren dwell together in Unity, to ſee the true Image of God raiſed in Perſons, and the knowing, and loving one another in the ſame Image, and bearing with one another through Love, and helping one another under their Temptations and Diſtreſſes of Spirit, which every one muſt expect to meet with.</p>
               <p>If thou art a Chriſtian in Deed, and in Truth, preſerve thy Conſcience pure and tender towards God; do not defile it with ſuch religious Practices, Duties, Ordinances, <hi>&amp;c.,</hi> as thou doſt not feel the Spirit leading thee into; for all ſuch are Idols and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly pollute thee. And be tender alſo of thy Brother's Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and be not an Inſtrument to draw him unto any Thing which the Lord leads him not into, but rejoice if thou find him in Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of Heart, ſtartling at any Thing; for if he abide here faithful, his Guide will in due Seaſon appear to him, and clear up his Way before him; but if he be too haſty he may follow a wrong Guide, and that Guide will never lead him aright towards the Kingdom, but intangle him further and further from it.</p>
               <p>O how many have run a Whoring from the Lord! How many have firſt loſt the Guidance of his Spirit, and then drowned their Life in religious Performances! How many have drunk of the Cup of Fornication from the Life; at the Hands of the fleſhly Wiſdom! How many have filled their Spirit with New-Teſtament Idols and Images! How many have even hardened their Hearts and Conſciences, by following the Doctrines of Men, their imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Meanings of Scriptures, and the Imaginations and Dreams of their own Hearts! Is it not time for Men at length to turn back towards the Lord, to wait for the Viſitation and Light of his Spirit, from whom they have gone a Whoring, and whom in all theſe Things they have grieved? And if ever any feel and enjoy the Guidance of God's Spirit, their Conſcience muſt be ke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

My Sheep hear my Voice, ſaith Chriſt, they know it; and the Voice of the ſtrange Spirit they know not, ſo as to follow it, but turn from it both in themſelves and others: But that which is not the Sheep, but hath only the Sheep's Cloathing, cries out, how ſhall we know the Voice of the Spirit? We may be deceived. Nay, that which is born of God, that which is the Elect of God, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deceived. Wait therefore for the Birth of the Spirit, to which the Spirit is given for a Guide, who infallibly guides it out of Deceit. All Deceivers are out of this Birth, out of this Spirit, perhaps in ſome Birth or other, framed from the letter, and living in the Imitation of ſome Practices and Ordinances from the letter (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which Cover they lie in wait to deceive) but Strangers to the Life and Power, and to that Wiſdom which begets and bears to God.

the coming of Chriſt. Thus the Chriſtians (in Name) have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally erred all along the Apoſtacy, and indeed (for the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallity) have not been true Chriſtians, but only a perſecuted Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant amongſt them, whoſe Life hath been nouriſhed and preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not by Doctrines and Obſervations which they have been taught by the Precepts of Men, nor by the Knowledge which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves have gathered; but by a little Bread daily handed to them from the Father of Mercies out of the Wilderneſs: That was the Thing which nouriſhed their Souls up to God, though many of them knew not diſtinctly what it was that nouriſhed them, nor how they came by it.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Yea, Uniformity is very lovely, and to be deſired and waited for, as the Spirit of the Lord which is one, leads and draws into one. But for the fleſhly Part (the wiſe reaſoning Part of Man) by fleſhly Ways and Means to ſtrive to bring about fleſhly Uniformity which enſnares and overbears the tender Conſcience, this is not lovely, nor ſpiritual, nor Chriſtian like. And the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, who exhorts Chriſtians to one Mind, yet doth not bid them force one another into one Mind, but walk together ſweetly ſo far as they had attained, and wherein they were otherwiſe minded, God in his due Time would reveal more to them, <hi>Philip</hi> iii. 15, 16. He that hath, to him it ſhall be given; and the Intent and Work of the Miniſtry (with the ſeveral Miniſtrations of it) is to bring into the Unity, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> iv. 13. as Perſons are able to follow, and not to force all Men into one Practice or Way; that's the Way to deſtroy the Faith, and the true Unity, and at beſt can Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce but a fleſhly Appearance of Unity in ſuch a Form of Worſhip and Godlineſs, as eats out the Power. And for being of one Heart and one Way, bleſſed be the Lord, this is in a Meaſure known and witneſſed; the Way is one Chriſt, the Truth of God; and he that is in the Faith, and in the Obedience to that Light which ſhines from his Spirit into the Heart of every Believer, hath a taſte of the one Heart, and of the one Way, and knoweth that no Variety of Practices (which is of God) can make a Breach in the true Unity. This is the one Way, for every one to be ſubject to that Light of Chriſt's Spirit which he hath received from Chriſt; and every one keeping here, there is alſo one Heart kept in the midſt of all the Variety, and Diverſity of Practices. And the Unity being thus kept, all will come into one outwardly; alſo at length, as the Light grows in every one, and as every one grows into the Light; but this muſt be patiently waited for from the Hand of God (who Hath the right Way of effecting it, and who alone can do it) and not harſhly and cruelly attempted by the rough Hand of Man.</p>
