            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Friends and Brethren, I have found it no ſmall matter, to enter in at the ſtrait gate and to keep the narrow way that leads unto life, for it bath lead me to forſake a dear Wife and Children, yea, my houſe and land, and all my worldly enjoyments, and not
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001233_0006_0FB1347FA17DDA40"/>only ſo, but to loſe all the friendſhip of the world, yea, to bury all my honour and glory in the duſt, and to be counted the off-ſcouring and filth of all things; yea, the ſtrait and narrow way hath lead me into Priſons, into Stocks, and to cruel Scourgings, mockings and deriſion, and I could not keep in it without perfect Patience under all theſe things; for through much Tribulation muſt we enter into the Kingdom of God; for it is written, All that will live Godly in Chriſt Jeſus muſt ſuffer perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and it is he only that overcometh that ſhall be crowned with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And the holy Ghoſt ſent down from heaven, by the father, in the name of the ſon, is the <hi>Third;</hi> and theſe three are but One God; for the Father is a Spirit, the Word is a Spirit, and the holy Ghoſt is a Spirit; and theſe three are but one God, one Life, one Spirit; and this Life, this Spirit, or this God, was not a Father before the Son was brought forth, according to what is written <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.22. &amp;c. And in creating all things, he became a creator; and in making himſelf a Lord-ſhip, became a Lord; ſo that he was the only God, from eternity before he was a father, or before he was the Word, or before be was a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or before he was a Lord, yea, before he was diſtinguiſhable; for the word of God was the firſt born of every Creature, and is the ſecond, being brought forth of God

            <p>Our firſt Parents while in an innocent ſtate, had not the knowledge of good and evil, which knowledge was the light of the ſpiritual law of God; for their firſt ſin was a tranſgreſſion in the figure; but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon that tranſgreſſion, the eyes of them both were opened; but an opened eye cannot ſee, without light, for whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever

            <p>In a word, the two Trees in the midſt of the garden of God repreſented the ſtate of the two <hi>Adams,</hi> and their Poſterity; the Tree of Knowledge, repreſented the miniſtration of the Law, to the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> and from him, to his poſterity, that by it we might underſtand what ſtate he ſtood in, even under the Law, by which Law came the Knowledge of Sin; and ſo death by ſin.

<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001233_0054_0FB134D8B7A1D240"/>his Miniſtry, it would have been as the offering of ſtrange fire, which the Lord commanded not; for the baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> was from heaven, &amp; proper only to himſelf to baptize, and not another, and all held John as a Prophet in power to that office particularly, and no other perſon; and therefore this was a Myſtery, that neither <hi>Johns</hi> diſciples, nor the <hi>Jews,</hi> could compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend; and therefore <hi>Johns</hi> diſciples repair to him, to inform him in the matter, that another was baptizing in the land of <hi>Judea,</hi> giving him an account who it was; for <hi>Johns</hi> Teſtimony of Chriſt was, that he that came after him ſhould baptize with the holy-ghoſt, and with fire, which was the Baptiſm they expected would have followed <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm, according to <hi>Johns</hi> Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but Gods ways are paſt finding out, till he diſcovereth them, for Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was to proclaim the name of his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Son in a higher degree than under Johns Miniſtry; but when they come to John, he quickly gives them light in the matter; for he was a burning and a ſhining light, his anſwer to them is <hi>v.</hi> 27. a man can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing except it be given him from heaven: thus John ſoon opens the matter to them, that Chriſt the Son of God, had his authority from heaven, to impower his
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:001233_0055_0FB134DBC1489918"/>diſciples to baptize in his name; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaith John to them, Ye your ſelves bear me witneſs, that I ſaid, I am not the Chriſt, but am ſent before him, he is the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, and hath the Bride; I am his friend, and rejoyce to hear his voice; he muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, but I muſt decreaſe; the Father loveth the Son, ſaith he to them, and hath given all things into his hand. Thus John ſoon ſatisfieth his diſciples, that Chriſt was the Son, and had power from heaven given him to impower his Servants to baptize in his name, yea, under this Commiſſion, they did not only baptize, and preach in his name, but did all manner of Cures, and caſt out Devils; for the Father glorified the Son, and gave all things into his hand, who had power to ſend forth his Apoſtles in his own name, to do all theſe things, to his glory and honour; and tho' the Apoſtle John calls this new miniſtration of Water Baptiſm, the Baptiſm of Chriſt, ſaying, Jeſus Baptized with his diſciples, &amp; that he baptized more diſciples then John, and that all men came to his Baptiſm; yet it is to be underſtood, he did it by his Commiſſion; for ſaith John at the end of the matter, Jeſus himſelf baptized not, but his diſciples.

Then ſuddenly <hi>Herod</hi> beheaded John in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and immediately heard of theſe mighty works alſo, and ſaid unto his ſervant, This is <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> he is riſen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do ſhew forth themſelves in him, but Chriſts ſame did ſtill increaſe more and more, according to Johns Teſtimony, who ſaid, I muſt decreaſe, but he muſt increaſe; for John did no miracle
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:001233_0057_0FB134DF61F73C78"/>under his Miniſtry; but Chriſts glory is ſet forth more and more, from one Miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to another.</p>
            <p>But the Spirit is not yet given forth, which <hi>John</hi> in his Miniſtry did point at, neither was it to be given, till Chriſt ſhould be glorified with a Reſurrection from the dead; for tho' the Father did glorifie the Son in Johns Miniſtry, with that lovely voice from heaven, and in the Apoſtles Miniſtry, with mighty ſigns and wonders, which they did in his name, yet in his Sufferings he was leaſt in the Kingdom of Heaven; for he came nor for to be miniſtred unto, but to miniſter, and to give his life a ranſom for many.</p>
            <p>Thus we have gone throw two Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, and both carried on under elementary figures, being ſigns of Sanctification by Jeſus Chriſt, that the Maſter may have the glory alone, of the vertue or thing thereby ſignified, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is divine, as he is divine, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth down from heaven, and therefore is to ſet forth his glory alone, who is the Lamb of God, and hath the ſeven Spirits of God, ſent forth into all the earth; as John ſaith, I have need to be Baptized of thee.</p>
            <p>After theſe two Miniſtrations, the Lord of life and glory was crucified for our ſins,

In the firſt place let us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, when and where this Order or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was given unto them; where it was given, is to be ſeen in the 16 and 17 <hi>v.</hi> Then the eleven diſciples went away into <hi>Galilee,</hi> into a Mountain, where Jeſus had appointed them; and when they ſaw him they worſhiped him, but ſome doubted. In the next place, let us ſearch the time when, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.31, 32. Then ſaid Jeſus, all ye ſhall be offended becauſe of me, this night, &amp;c. but after that I am riſen again, I will go before you into <hi>Galilee:</hi> Compare this with the 28 Chap. 7 and 10 <hi>v.</hi> and they teſtifie, that very early on the firſt day of the week, while it was yet dark the Angel of the Lord, and the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſent <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> in great haſte, to tell his diſciples, that they ſhould go
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:001233_0060_0FB134E4C0B5DAB0"/>into <hi>Galilee,</hi> there they ſhould ſee him; which was the place he appointed to meet with them, the night in which he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed: And in the 16. <hi>v.</hi> it is ſaid, Then the Eleven diſciples went away into <hi>Galilee</hi> into a Mountain, where Jeſus had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. And in the 18. <hi>v.</hi> it appears that there, and then, he gave them this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. Thus is appears, that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was delivered to them in <hi>Galilee,</hi> and immediately upon their firſt ſight of him after his Reſurrection. In the next place, let us view the Commiſſion, with the Orders and Promiſe annixt to it; <hi>firſt,</hi> They are to go under his Authority; <hi>ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> they are to diſciple the nations; <hi>thirdly</hi> to baptize them; and, <hi>fourthly,</hi> to teach them to obſerve all things which Chriſt had commanded them to teach; and, <hi>fifthly,</hi> A promiſe is joyned to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, to wit, that Chriſt himſelf will be with them alway, even unto the end of the world. From hence we may obſerve, that this promiſe is not made only to them; but to all that ſhould after believe through their word, ſucceſſively, even to the end of the world. In the next place, we are to conſider, here is no account, what it was he did order them to teach the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to obſerve, neither have we and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:001233_0061_0FB134E5AFC5C838"/>what baptiſm this was that they were to baptize with; and thoſe are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary things to know, and by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion it ſelf we cannot know them; And tho' the Lord declared them to the Eleven Apoſtles in private, yet they were to make them publick to the whole world; and therefore we are to conſider, we muſt come to know them by the Apoſtles Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine and Practice; for this was the way Chriſt did then intend to make them known by; the next thing in order to know what they did teach, &amp; with what baptiſm they did baptize with, is to come to their Miniſtration under this Commiſſion, ſeeing that was the way Chriſt did then purpoſe to make it known by to the Nations.</p>
            <p>I queſtion, Whether they entred upon their Miniſtry, as ſoon as they received their Commiſſion? <hi>Anſwer,</hi> No, for they received their Commiſſion in <hi>Galilee,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath been proved; and immediately upon the Reſurrection of Chriſt, but he aſſembled himſelf with them forty days after this, and commanded them to wait at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for the promiſe of the Spirit, which <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> fore-told of; ſaying, <hi>Is ſhall baptize you with the holy Ghoſt, and with Fire,</hi> Acts 1.4, 5. But, ſaith he, wait for the promiſe of the Father, which, ſaith
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:001233_0062_0FB134E716FEF680"/>he, ye have heard of me; for <hi>John</hi> truly baptized with Water, but ye ſhall be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized with the holy Ghoſt not many days hence. From hence we may obſerve, that Chriſt puts his Apoſtles in mind of that Promiſe, which the Father promiſed by <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> concerning himſelf how that the Son ſhould have that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> put upon him, as to baptize with the holy Ghoſt, and ſignifies it to his twelve Apoſtles that the time is now at hand, that John for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

From hence it appears, that the Apoſtles themſelves had need to be baptized by Chriſt, as well as John the Baptiſt.</p>
            <p>Now while they were waiting at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with one accord, in one place, ſuddenly there came a ſound from heaven, as of a ruſhing mighty Wind, and it filled all the houſe, where they were ſitting; and there appeared unto them cloven Tongues, like as of fire, and it ſat upon each of them; and they were all filled with the holy Ghoſt. This is the Baptiſm which John fore-told of; now we ſee they are endued with power from heaven, under a ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion

               </gap>im of the time that they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to enter into their Miniſtry, under the aforeſaid Commiſſion; and Johns Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony is fulfilled concerning Chriſts Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, who baptizeth with the holy Ghoſt and with ſire, before the eyes of all Nations under heaven. So that it appears, he that gave the Commiſſion, baptizeth with the holy Ghoſt and with Fire, according to Johns Teſtimony; but what Baptiſm they that were commiſſionated to baptize, it doth not yet appear what it was with, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.14, But <hi>Peter</hi> ſtanding up with the Eleven [Note, it is a mutual voice] and ſaid unto them, Hear theſe words, Jeſus a man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of God, ye have taken and by wicked
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:001233_0064_0FB134EA47C739E8"/>hands have <hi>crucified,</hi> whom God hath raiſed up where of we all are witneſles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart, &amp; ſaid unto <hi>Peter,</hi> &amp; to the reſt of the Apoſtles, (note this that they enquire of <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; of the reſt of the Apoſtles, what their duty is, accordingly they give them a particular account, <hi>Firſt,</hi> To Repent, and <hi>Secondly,</hi> To be baptized, every one of them, in the name of the Lord, for the Remiſſion of ſins; and, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Apoſtles make an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute promiſe unto them, that upon theſe terms they ſhall receive the gift of the holy Ghoſt. Here it appears plainly, what Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines they were ordered to preach, and what Baptiſm they were ordered to Baptize with, under this Commiſſion; for now they have diſcovered it to all nations under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven at once. <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to their Doctrine, they preach a crucified Chriſt to them, and teſtifie to them, that God hath raiſed him from the dead; and that they are his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the truth of it; this is their Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which they go to diſciple them into the belief of; and it is ſuch a Doctrine which was never before preacht, which Doctrine did prick them to their hearts, and made them cry out to know what was required of them to do? The Apoſtles an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, Repent, and, <hi>Secondly,</hi> be baptiſed
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:001233_0065_0FB134EC8E3F27E0"/>in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sins; and, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the promiſe they the afore-mentioned things being done, they ſhall receive the gift of the holy Ghoſt. So that this Baptiſm which they were to baptize with, in this Commiſſion, was ſuch a Baptiſm, as they could baptize them with, before they received the holy Ghoſt; for the gift of the holy Ghoſt was that Baptiſm which the Apoſtles themſelves were at this time baptized with, before their eyes, and is proper only to Jeſus Chriſt to baptize with, who hath the Spirit without meaſure, and who alone can baptize with it. So that it appears, this Baptiſm which the Apoſtles were to Baptize with, under this Comiſſion, was to guide their faith, in that doctrine which they taught them, to wit, in Chriſts death and Reſurrection, by which faith they ſhould come to obtain the Remiſſion of their ſins, and alſo come to receive the gift of the holy Ghoſt from him who alone is able to baptize with the Spirit, and thereby to ſeal to their Miniſtry and Apoſtleſhip. And we have here a further account that they which gladly received his Word, were baptized, and continued ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrine, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayer: Thus they taught them, as they were ordered in their Commiſſion; for
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:001233_0066_0FB134EDDB003758"/>their order in their Commiſſion, was, To teach them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have commanded you, ſaith Chriſt; and ſuch as received their word, continued in their Doctrine ſteadfaſtly. And among other things, we have here an account, that they taught them the Ordinance of breaking of Bread, which was to be a guide to their Faith, that by the death of Chriſt, his Church comes to be fed with the Bread of Life from heaven, and is to continue in his Church, to ſhew forth his death till he comes, who hath purchaſed by his bitter Death, this living Bread ſent down from heaven, to feed and nouriſh his Church with.</p>
            <p>Seeing it was the purpoſe of our Lord to let all the world know, what Baptiſm they were commiſſionated to baptize with in this commiſſion, by their publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, let us therefore go on, and view what baptiſm they did baptize with, and their Succeſſors, who had their information from the Apoſtles mouthes; for it was the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Chriſt, in that Commiſſion, to be with them, and with their Succeſſors, in their Miniſtration, even unto the end of the world; ſo that we muſt be guided by their Doctrine and Practice, which is a ſtanding Rule, which Chriſt hath ſet in his Church, even unto the end of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:001233_0067_0FB134EF5B392978"/>
In the <hi>8th Chap.</hi> of the <hi>Acts,</hi> we have an accourt, that <hi>Phillip</hi> had an immediate Call of God, to the work of the Miniſtry, who was the Apoſtles Succeſſor in their day and time, who had information from their Mouthes, what their Orders in that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was, who followed their foot ſteps, came to <hi>Samarita</hi> and there preached the Goſpel to them, and both men and women believed, and were baptiſed. Now when the Apoſtles which were at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> heard that the Samaritans had received the Word of God, they ſent unto them <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> (theſe are the two chief of them, which received the orders and directons from Chriſts own Mouth, from whom Phil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip had his directions,) who when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might recive the holy Ghoſt; for as yet, he was fallen upon none of them, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were baptized into the Name of the Lord Jeſus; for ſo all the latter tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlators agree to, that it is the ſame word that is in the Commiſtion, to wit, into the Name of the Lord Jeſus; ſo likewiſe, where <hi>Paul</hi> thanked God, he baptized only <hi>Criſpus</hi> and <hi>Gaius</hi> of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> leſt (ſaith he) any ſhould ſay I had baptized into my own name, uſing the word <hi>into</hi> according to the Commiſſion; ſo that it appears, theſe which
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:001233_0068_0FB134F0D6DD35E0"/>
               <hi>Paul</hi> baptized with Water, and theſe which <hi>Phillip</hi> baptized before they received the holy Ghoſt, they both baptized them according to the Commiſſion, to wit, <hi>into</hi> the Name of the Lord Jeſus. Now both theſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were Succeſſors to the twelve Apoſtles being afterwards immediately called to preach the Goſpel, and received this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Baptiſm, by tradition, from the Apoſtles, who delivered it to the Church by Chriſts order, to be a ſettled Ordinance, to guide the faith of the Church in Chriſts death, for the Remiſſion of her ſins, that the Church might not be bewildered in her imaginations, concerning the Remiſſion of her ſins, but might know it to be by the death of Chriſt, which Baptiſin pointeth at; as will appear more evidently hereafter</p>
            <p>So that by this Baptiſm, they baptized them into a profeſſion of the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, believing that the Remiſſion of their ſins came only and alone by the meritorious Death of Jeſus Chriſt, by whom they are juſtified; and upon this Faith and Baptiſm Chriſt himſelf, as Saviour, bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizeth them with the holy Ghoſt, by which Baptiſm he ſeals his name upon them; for it is he only that hath the Seal of the living God, and ſo ſeals us to the day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, by his holy Spirit; but not the Apoſtles, nor any other Miniſter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="unknown:001233_0069_0FB13584922BF270"/>
And as I before ſaid, when <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were come down, they prayed for them (whom <hi>Phillip</hi> had before baptized into the name of the Lord Jeſus, that is, into the faith of the Lord Jeſus,) that they might recive the holy Ghoſt; for as yet he was fallen upon none of them, (ſaith the Scripture,) but only they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jeſns; then laid they their hands on them, and they received the holy Ghoſt. Thus was <hi>Phillips</hi> Miniſtry and Baptiſm confirmed by the Apoſtles, and Chriſt himſelf from Heaven, ſo that their Doctrine and Baptiſm under that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, was confirmed to their Succeſſors immediately from Heaven; and ſo <hi>Phillip</hi> goes on in his Miniſtry, by the immediate motion of the Spirit of God, and baptizeth the Eunuch, as is written, they both went down into the water and he baptiſed him.</p>
            <p>And in the <hi>10th</hi> of the <hi>Acts,</hi> we have an account, that the Angel of the Lord appeare<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> unto <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and bid him ſend for <hi>Peter,</hi> for (ſaith the Angel) he ſhall tell thee what thou oughteſt to do. Thus we may obſerve, that the Apoſtles ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors were to be informed of them, what they ought to do; for Chriſt delivered his Orders to them and directed their ſucceſſors to receive them from their months; ſo that
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:001233_0070_0FB1358A167D33C0"/>what they did and taught, was Gods mouth to us; and the Orders they received, was immediate from Chriſts mouth. Now when <hi>Peter</hi> was come to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> he tells him how they ſlew Chriſt and hanged him on a Tree, and how that God raiſed him from the dead, and that they were his witneſſes of theſe things; and while <hi>Peter</hi> was thus ſpeaking, the holy Ghoſt fell on all them that heard him: Then anſwered <hi>Peter,</hi> Can any man forbid Water, that theſe ſhould not be baptized, which have received the holy Ghoſt as well as we? and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them to be baptized, in the Name of the Lord. From hence we may obſerve, That <hi>Cornelius</hi> was ordered to ſend for <hi>Peter</hi> to be informed what he ought to do; <hi>Secondly,</hi> when <hi>Peter</hi> was come to him, he preached Chriſt crucified to him and how God raiſed him from the dead, &amp;<hi>c.</hi> And, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> how that while <hi>Peter</hi> was ſpeaking, the holy Ghoſt fell on all them that heard him. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Let us take notice of <hi>Peters</hi> Anſwer, by way of queſtion, Can any man forbid Water, ſaith he, that theſe ſhould not be baptized, which have received the holy Ghoſt as well as we? And he commanded them to be baptized in the Name of the Lord. Here is two things obſervable; the <hi>firſt</hi> is, <hi>Peter</hi> uſeth it as an undeniable
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:001233_0071_0FB1358B56A46AD0"/>argument, that theſe ought to be baptized, ſeeing they had received the holy Ghoſt; and, <hi>Secondly,</hi> he that was ſent of God, to teach them what they ought to do, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them with Authority to be baptized in the Name of the Lord, from whom he had his Comiſſion to baptize; and this was immediately upon their entrance into their Office, under their laſt Commiſſion; for in their firſt Commiſſion, they were ſent to preach and to baptize, only to the loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but not to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as hath been already proved; but under this Commiſſion, they are to preach and to baptize all Nations; and this <hi>Cornelius</hi> was the firſt of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> was ſent to, under this Commiſſion, immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon his receiving power to preach and baptize under it, as appears in the firſt of the <hi>Acts,</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> But ye ſhall receive Power, after the holy Ghoſt is come upon you, and ye ſhall be witneſſes unto me, both in <hi>Jer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> and in <hi>Judea,</hi> and in <hi>Samaria,</hi> and unto the uttermoſt part of the Earth. In the 11th chap. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> it appears, that the Angel did not only bid <hi>Cornelius</hi> ſend for <hi>Peter,</hi> to be informed by him what he ſhould do, but told him alſo, that <hi>Peter</hi> ſhould ſpeak words whereby he and all his houſe ſhould be ſaved; which ſalvation was
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:001233_0072_0FB1358CE1161BA8"/>preached to him through Chriſt crucified; he readily believes the Doctrine, and God ſeals his Salvation to him, through this faith in Chriſts Blood; and Baptiſm is an Ordinance ſtated by God, to guide the faith of his Church in Chriſts Blood alone, for the remiſſion of ſins; and when <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw that the holy Ghoſt ſealed to <hi>Cornelius</hi> his ſalvation, through faith in Chriſts Blood, ſaid he, <hi>Can any man forbid Water?</hi> his words implyed, ſeeing our Authority un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Chriſts Commiſſion to preach and to baptize, is ſeen to be from heaven, and therefore under this Commiſſion, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them with Authority to baptize.</p>
            <p>And as to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> tho' he was immediately called of God to preach the Goſpel, (as all Gods Miniſters are,) yet he was the Apoſtles Succeſſor, and therefore muſt receive his orders ſuccesſively; for he comes under the order of their Commisſion and therefore when the Lord firſt appeared unto him, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid, What ſhall I do Lord? and the Lord ſaid unto him, ariſe, and go into <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and there it ſhall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do. Thus he is ordered to receive his Directions from his Predeceſſors, they muſt be Chriſts mouth to him, which is agreeable to the Scriptures handing them
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:001233_0073_0FB1359144E1D120"/>down to us, from their mouth; for when <hi>Annanias</hi> came to him, to inform him what he ſhould do, and had laid his hands on him ſo that he had received his ſight, and was filled with the holy Ghoſt, why tarrieſt thou (ſaith <hi>Annania<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi>) ariſe and be baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 22.16. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 9.17, 18. Thus it appears that baptiſm is a ſtated Ordinance in the Church, by Chriſts Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his Apoſtles, and none ſince called in particular, immediately of God to baptize, tho' they are called of God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to preach the Goſpel; but it is to be practiſed as an Ordinance delivered to the Church, according to <hi>Pauls</hi> Teſtimony, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. Now I praiſe you Bretheren, that you remember me in all things, and keep the Ordinances, as I delivered them to you. Thus the Church of Chriſt, is to be in the practiſe of the Ordinances of Chriſt from the information of the Scriptures, as <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> who were the Apoſtles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="73" facs="unknown:001233_0074_0FB13593CEC1F828"/>that <hi>Annanias</hi> was commanded to do it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We have an account in <hi>Acts</hi> 19. that <hi>Paul</hi> found certain diſciples, of whom he enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Whether they had received the holy Ghoſt, fince they believed? and they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, they had not ſo much as heard whether there be any holy Ghoſt; and he ſaid unto them, Into what then were ye baptiſed?

And, no doubt but multitudes, that were baptized with <hi>Johns</hi> baptiſm, which was to believe on him which was to come after him, were after baptiſed into the Name of the Lord Jeſus; for <hi>John</hi> was ſent before to make ready a people for the Lord, and it is ſaid, that all <hi>Judea,</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was baptiſed of <hi>John</hi> in the River of <hi>Jordan;</hi> and after when Jeſus came into the Land of <hi>Judea,</hi> and tarried with his diſciples, and baptiſed, it is ſaid that all men came to him, and that he made and baptized more diſciples than <hi>John,</hi> tho' he himſelf baptized not; for he did it by his Commiſſion, and it is evident, that theſe were baptiſed into the Name of the Lord Jeſus with Water by <hi>Paul,</hi> and that he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards laid his hands on them, and then they received the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.5, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, (at the ceſſation of that Paſſover, which was to guide the faith of his Church in him that was to come, till he ſhould come and fulfill that Ordinance in the Kingdom of God, by the ſacrifice of himſelf,) hath ſettled a New-Teſtament Ordinance in his Church; to ſhew forth his

And therefore for any to ſay, <hi>I have bread from heaven, by which I live, and am daily nouriſhed by it; the outward Bread can but feed my outward man, I have drank of the Spirit of Life, which is the Cup of my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, by which I ſhall thirſt no more; this makes my heart glad more than a Cup of Wine, which will only refreſh the outward man.</hi>

But now mine eye ſeeth thee, yea, every one of Gods faithful Children do behold the glory of the Lord, with open face, as in a glaſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, 18. for that ſpirit ſent into our hearts is the Lord Jeſus in his divine nature, as in the 17. <hi>v.</hi> for the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> is a quickning Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45.

But the annointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you, but as the ſame anointing teacheth you: This anointing is the Spirit of truth, which all Gods faithful Children are anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

Examine your ſelves whether ye be in the faith, prove your own ſelves, know you not your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be Reprobates? for it is the living creating Word of God, that made all things in the beginning, that gives us ſtrength againſt the wicked One, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 2, 14. I have written unto you Young men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ye are ſtrong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked One, This is that very Word which created all things, and after was made fleſh, and is become a great high Prieſt unto his people, being called of God as was <hi>Aaron;</hi> And his people know in themſelves the truth of the Scriptures Teſtimony of his being ſo; But they that are in a dead faith
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:001233_0106_0FB183F61B0AF558"/>only believe him to be ſo by the report of the Scriptures, but are not made partakers of the benefit of his Prieſtly Office, and therefore have no experimental knowledge of the Truth of the Scripture; for he is not their high Prieſt, tho' they hypocritically profeſs him to be ſo, not being partakers of the benefit of his Prieſtly Office. Now the reaſon of the difference of theſe two ſtates is this, tho' the firſt tidings of the report that Jeſus Chriſt is a High Prieſt, comes by the Scripture, and they both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the report by one and the ſame faith at the firſt; yet they do not both take the ſame courſe, to be benefited in his Prieſtly Office, for the one doth endeavour to be benefited in his Prieſtly Office by Repentance and earneſt Prayer and Supplication to God, for the pardon of all theis ſins, hoping to obtain it, accordingly they do; for upon this Repentance and hope, God confirms to them the truth of the ſcriptures Report, in taking away the guilt of their ſins from off their Conſciences; for where remiſſion of ſin is, there remains no more guilt upon the Conſcience; for God ſends the Spirit of his Son into their inward parts, and ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies them and makes them inwardly clean and holy; and thus their hiſtorical faith is become a living faith; for now they are
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:001233_0107_0FB183F7634119C8"/>come to know the truth of the Scriptures report; ſo that now their faith is from an inward ſight: But the other taketh another courſe; for they believing the ſcriptures report, concerning Chriſts Prieſtly Office, with a dead faith, or an hiſtorical faith, they come to obtain a dead hope of mercy and forgiveneſs of their ſins; and upon this faith and hope, they imbody themſelves into an outward Church fellowſhip, and partake of the Ordinances, and under this dead faith and dead hope, they offer to God abundance of dead Prayers, and all this is done in their ſinful ſtate: So that theſe never come to know the certainty of the truth of the Scriptures report, nor ſee the ſtate of the other; and ſo much the exacter they walk according to the letter of the Scripture, (tho' they have no fellowſhip with the Spirit of God) ſo much greater is their deluſion.</p>
            <p>But the other are really freed from the guilt and polution of ſin, through Chriſts Prieſtly Office, according to the Scriptures teſtimony, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.18.

Therefore if any man be in Chriſt, he is a New Creature, old things are paſt away, behold all thing are become new. This wonderful change hath God wrought in every one that is intereſted in Chriſts Prieſtly Office; for they ſee this great work wrought in themſelves, with their own eyes, for the old things which are now gone away, were the effect and
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:001233_0109_0FB183FB6DEA68E8"/>fruit of their body of ſins, but now their body of ſin is nailed to the Croſs of Chriſt, that is, Chriſt hath ſuffered for them on the croſs, and this Offering God hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted for a full Satisfaction, and hath ſignified it to them, by freeing them from their ſin, and ſo creating all things a new in them, ſo that now they are become new Creatures; and all that are under a profeſſion of being Chriſtians, and do not ſee this change wrought in themſelves, they are Hypocrites and Anti-chriſtians, and are not intereſted in Chriſts Prieſtly Office, and do but lye, in ſaying, Chriſt is their Prieſt, for they are none of his Church, but are of the Synagogue of Satan, according to what is written, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.9. <q>Behold, I will make them of the Synagogue of Satan which ſay they are <hi>Jews,</hi> and are not, but do lye;</q> behold, they ſhall come and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. But all that are intruſted in Chriſts Prieſtly Office, ſee this great work of Mortification and Sanctification wrought in themſelves, and can ſay in truth, that Jeſus Chriſt is their Prieſt, not becauſe the ſcripture ſaid he is a Prieſt, for theſe are eye witneſſes of the truth of it, being partakers of the benefit of it, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to what is written, <hi>Gal.,</hi> 3.1. before

It is written in the Prophets, And they ſhall be all taught of God, every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father, cometh to me; not that any man hath ſeen the father, ſave he which is of God, he hath ſeen the father. Thus it appeareth plainly, the reaſon why the one hath a living faith, and the other but a dead faith, becauſe the one hath a faith in God only from the report of the ſcriptures, but are altogether alienated from any right knowledge or acquaintance with God; but the faith of the other, is from their hearing of Gods voice immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, with their own ears, being taught by him, and in ſeeing of him with their own eyes; for their Bodies are his Temple, where they ſee his face, and here his Voice, for his word abideth in them, ſaith the ſcripture, 1 <hi>Job.</hi> 2.14.</p>

               </gap>dge in your ſelves, is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered, doth not even nature it ſelf teach you, that if a man have long hair, it is a ſhame unto him, but if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given her for a Covering. From hence we may plainly ſee, it is a covering placed (by God) in nature, and given only to the Woman to cover her head with, and nature teacheth the woman to make a covering of it, and to cover her head with it; for ſaith the Apoſtle, her hair is given her for a covering; but contrary wiſe, nature teacheth the man, not to make uſe of his hair, to cover his head with it, as the woman doth, becauſe God hath not given it to him for a covering, is be hath to the woman; and therefore
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:001233_0148_0FB18444A73D2A80"/>nature it ſelf teacheth the Man, not to wear his hair any longer than is for his comfort; for ſaith the Apoſtle in the ſeventh verſ. <hi>A Man indeed ought not to cover his head, for as much as he is the image <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> and glory of God; but the Woman is the glory of the Man.</hi> So that God hath given this covering to the Woman, in ſign of her ſubjection to him, who is made in the Image of God.</p>
            <p>Therefore for the man to make uſe of his hair for a covering, as the woman doth, diſhonoureth himſelf, who is the head; for as much as he is in the Image and glory of God, but the Woman is made to be a glory to the Man, by her ſubjection to him; and her ſubjection to him, is her glory in the ſight of God; for ſhe was made for him, and not the Man for her; <hi>for this cauſe</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) in the 10. v. <hi>ought the Woman to have power on her head, becauſe of the Angels:</hi> for as the Angels are made miniſtring Spirits before him, in whoſe image man was made, ſo is the woman an help, as before him, who is made to be her head &amp; ſhe is to be a glory to him, by her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and hath power given her of God to cover her head with her hair, in token of it.</p>
            <p>Thus it appeareth, by what the Apoſtle writeth to this Church, that the man pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God, and prophecying to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="148" facs="unknown:001233_0149_0FB18447A6D68140"/>his head being thus covered, diſhonoureth his head; when as God hath not given him his hair to cover his head with, as the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man doth, and ought to do. And therefore every woman praying or propheſying with her head uncovered, diſhonoureth her head, (for ſaith the Apoſtle) her Hair is given her for a Covering.</p>
            <p>Thus it appeareth, that it is the hair that the Apoſtle is treating upon, and that it is a ſhame for a man to wear long hair, and much more for a man to pray or prophecy with it on his head in the preſence of God and his Church, when as it is not given him for a covering, as it is to the Woman, ſo that it ought not to be on the mans head, as any time, but ought to be on the Womans head at all times, and the Apoſtle telleth them, ſaying, <hi>We have no ſuch cuſtom, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Churches of God,</hi> that is, to wear long hair, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
