            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A FEW REASONS IN FAVOUR OF VENDUES.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T has always been considered as a general rule, That trade will regulate itself; and this being granted, Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues or Auctions will be found rather advantageous than destructive: For, should it be said, that great quantities of goods are by this means sold to a loss, let it be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that this must be owing to the too great quantities imported, which must either be kept on hand a long time, or be disposed of in this manner.</p>
            <p>BY there being Vendues, or places of public sale of goods in and about this city, many strangers, (Captains of vessels and others) are encouraged to import quantities of goods, who, from their situation, are prevented from selling them upon equal terms with our settled merchants, not knowing the people, or who to trust, and perhaps obliged to return in a short time, they are of course led to this mode of sale, by which they <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> immediately in cash for their goods, and enabled to purchase our produce.</p>
            <p>PARTICULARLY the traders to and from Ireland, who, it is well known, import large quantities of linens and other goods into this place annually, and depend in a great measure on the Vendues to turn them into cash, which they usually lay out in the purchase of flax-seed, flour or lumber.</p>
            <p>BUT it has been objected, that encouraging strangers to sell their goods among us, who are here but a short time, and bear no part of the burdens occasioned by taxes, &amp;c. is injurious to our merchants.</p>
            <p>THIS must appear to have little weight, when we consider that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent flourishing state of this province and city, is in a great measure owing to the encouragement given to strangers, (if the merchants and traders from Great Britain and Ireland may be called so) who, by being permitted to bring their goods and wares to our market, have kept the country well supplied; and in return, have taken off large quantities of our produce.</p>
            <p>ADD to this, that where ever the greatest quantities of goods are, there of course will the people resort, both with their cash and produce, not only from being sure of obtaining what they may want, but from a prospect of obtaining their goods on better terms.</p>
            <p>IF it be granted, that the importation of British manufactures are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, and of advantage to the country, then those persons that introduce and dispose of them on the lowest terms, must be confessed the best friends to the community, and deserve their countenance and encouragement.</p>
            <p>BUT strangers, from their situation and circumstances, generally dispose of their goods at a much lower rate than the stated merchant; therefore, it is the interest of the community to encourage their trade with us. By this means, we get those goods that we want for our own consumption (and for which we are beholden to other countries) at the lowest rates; and those people in return, generally give the highest price for our produce.</p>
            <p>WE might here quote the New-England trade, by which large quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of fish, oil, &amp;c. are imported into our province, and in return, they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase our flour, pork, iron, &amp;c. which certainly keeps up the price of those commodities, and must be of advantage to our country: They also supply us with a great sum in bills of exchange, which prevents the merchants from sending off the specie in remittance. Put all those considerations to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and they do certainly prove, that it is the interest of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to give the greatest encouragement to strangers trading among us; and therefore, the suppressing the Vendues, or laying any tax or duty upon the goods sold by them, which for the greatest part belong to strangers, must be a discouragement to their trade with us, and in its consequences injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the country in general.</p>
            <p>THOSE persons who are desirous to have the Vendues suppressed, or laid under a heavy duty or fine, have mentioned the conduct of the New-York Assembly, as a pattern for ours to follow (which, by the bye, is the first instance of the kind in America). In answer, it may be observed, that the New-Yorkers once, by an order of their corporation, fixed the price of meat, butter, eggs, &amp;c. that the country brought in for their daily provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; but this has not yet been copied by our corporation, as, no doubt, they must have seen the absurdity of it; for the event proved, they had like to have been starved, the country justly resenting such a regulation, and with-holding their produce until the ordinance was repealed. In like manner, we find they have already been obliged to amend the first law made against Vendues, and have now reduced their duty from five to two <hi>per cent.</hi> and it is not to be doubted, but in a little time they will be obliged to take it entirely off.</p>
            <p>THE suppression or taxing of Vendues will probably introduce Pawn-Brokers, as in London, when those who are in great want of cash, and under the necessity of raising it in a short time, will be oblige to pledge their goods at, perhaps, quarter their value, and allow the Broker a large premium beside for the use of the money; and if those goods are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed at the limited time, they become the property of the Broker, at the price they were pawned or pledged at. This evil must be confessed to be much greater than the most extravagant description given of Vendues.</p>
            <p>BUT, if it should be said by any person, that the design of the petition carried to the Honourable House of Assembly, is not to suppress, but to regulate Vendues, then the question might be asked, In what manner the regulation is proposed? Whether, by subjecting the goods sold at them to a certain fee or duty, or by only regulating the mode in which their public sales shall be conducted?</p>
            <p>IF the first should be attempted, it certainly will be injurious, and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate as a great discouragement to strangers, and a tax upon the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, as it is confessed, that goods, as they are at present sold at Vendue, will not bear an additional charge.</p>
            <p>SHOULD the latter be all that is intended, it is presumed, that the Vendue-Masters themselves would have no objection, as several of them have frequently expressed a desire that such a measure should take place.</p>
            <p>AND in this, perhaps, we could not follow better examples, than some of the great trading cities in Europe. In Amsterdam, the numbers of Brokers are limited to 395, who are obliged to take out licences, give security, and be upon oath. In London, the number of Brokers are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited, but they are also obliged to take out licences, give security, and be upon oath.</p>
            <p>THIS is mentioned, as it appears from the face of the petition, that the subscribers only request a regulation; and, it is beyond all doubt, that a very great majority of them look on Vendues both useful and necessary, and would not have signed the petition, had they imagined any thing more than regulation was intended.</p>
            <p>IT has been hinted, to suppress all Vendues in the Northern Liberties and Southwark, by which all business in that way will fall into the hands of <hi>one</hi> only. The partiality and injustice of such a measure, is too great to suppose it would meet with the least encouragement by so respectable and impartial a body as our Representatives.</p>
            <p>THERE are at present a number of gentlemen employed in that business, of unexceptionable characters, who have done the business of their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployers with the greatest honour and punctuality, notwithstanding the many illiberal reflections thrown out by some persons: And must these per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons at once be deprived of their livelihood? shall a business that can give bread to so many be monopolised by one? will the public be better served by this means? or, will it put a stop to the pretended evil? Certainly, No.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole, therefore, as this matter is now laid before the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable House of Assembly, it is not to be doubted, that, should they be of opinion, that a regulation of Vendues are become necessary, they will endeavour to do it in such a manner as will tend to promote the best inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of the community in general. At the same time, that they will be tender of the interest of those individuals who are employed therein; by not giving an undue preference to one to the great injury of the rest.</p>
