         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Short ANSWER TO <hi>John Graham</hi>'s SERMON.</head>
            <p>I Obſerve, firſt, that <hi>John Graham</hi> takes for his Text, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.9. <hi>Be not carried about with divers and ſtrange Doctrine</hi> &amp;c. And in his firſt Page, ſays, <hi>the main Defects of Wit are Error and Ignorance.</hi> Anſwer, I think it would have been much more proper for him to have ſaid, <hi>Religion</hi> than <hi>Wit,</hi> ſeeing his Diſcourſe is concerning Religion, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I ſhall let that paſs without further Notice, and ſhall freely own, that <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> are both very bad in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and very often are found together, one being, as it were the Effect of the other; for when People are kept in Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance by their Teachers, and are not allowed, (nor do not take the Liberty themſelves) to ſearch and try for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002508_0003_0FDB672499A87B40"/>
nor to prove all things, that ſo they may diſcern Truth from Error, they are often, nay, generally kept in Error as well as Ignorance, and often made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that <hi>Error</hi> is <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Truth Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</hi> Therefore it behoves us all to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well what is Error and what Doctrines are <hi>Strange Doctrines,</hi> which I conclude all to be, that are contrary to the true Doctrines of Chriſtianity taught by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles. And to <hi>John Graham</hi> goes on preaching againſt Error and Ignorance, exhorting his hearers to beware of it, and warning them againſt converſing wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>he People called <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,</hi> or reading their Books, pretending they are Guilty thereof, which if it were ſo, I ſhould allow his Cautions to be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but if on Tryal and Examination it ſhould prove quite otherwiſe, and that the <hi>Quakers</hi> and their Books are Sound and <hi>Orthodox,</hi> and himſelf and his Book guilty of <hi>Error, Ignorance</hi> and <hi>ſtrange Doctrines,</hi> as I doubt not but I ſhall plainly prove, and that by the Teſtimony of Holy Scripture, which he, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002508_0004_0FDB6726A546C150"/>
calls the <hi>Word</hi> and would have all Spirits tryed by it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> I am willing that our Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines, Principles and Practices, and his too, ſhould be brought to the Teſt of Holy Scripture, and that which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant and agreeable thereto, ſhould be condemned, and that which is, to be approved; and when that is done, I make no Queſtion, but it will plainly appear that we are clear and himſelf guilty, ſo I adviſe his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>rers and all others to Search and Try for themſelves like as the Noble <hi>Bereans</hi> did in Days of Old who when <hi>Paul</hi> preached to them, that which ſome then called <hi>ſtrange Doctrines,</hi> as <hi>Acts</hi> 17.20. for <hi>thou bringeſt certain ſtrange Things to our Ears,</hi> &amp;c. They ſearched the Scriptures to ſee whether theſe things were ſo, and did not to take their Teachers Words for it, that all is Error and Hereſie that they call ſo; for that is the way to be kept in Ignorance and Darkneſs, as ſome whole Nations are at this Day, by heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning unto and following their Blind Guides, who call every Appearance of Light and Truth, by the Name of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie</hi>

and <hi>Error, and if the blind lead the blind, both ſhall fall into the Ditch,</hi> Mat. 15.14.</p>
            <p>Therefore I deſire all to ſee for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and try whether they be in the true Faith or not, ſeeing we muſt all give an Account every one for himſelf, before God, and then it will not be a ſufficient excuſe to ſay, our Teachers told us that the <hi>Truth</hi> was <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and we took their Words for it, without further Tryal. So I ſhall paſs over the moſt of the fore part of his Book, which is in general levelled againſt <hi>Error</hi> and <hi>Hereſie,</hi> and thoſe that Teach it, ſeeing we are not ſuch (though by him intended) that I may come to thoſe Particulars that ſeem chiefly to concern Us, and our Doctorine, and prove them, even all that we Hold and Teach to be neither <hi>Error</hi> nor <hi>Hereſie,</hi> but <hi>Goſpel Truths,</hi> and that he is Guilty of <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Error,</hi> by oppoſing and ſpeaking Evil of Truth, and thoſe that profeſs it, and walk therein, and thereby prove and make appear, <hi>that we are none of thoſe that are carried about with divers and ſtrange Doctrines,</hi> neither is the Light
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002508_0006_0FDB672B0F9DDD20"/>
that is in us Darkneſs, but the light of Chriſt, that lighteth every Man that cometh into the World, with the light of Life, See <hi>John</hi> 1. for that is the light that we ſpeak of and bear Teſtimony of, and the <hi>Spirit of Truth</hi> that Chriſt ſaid his Father would ſend in his Name to lead true believers into all Truth.</p>
            <p>IN Page 14. <hi>John Graham</hi> comes to particularize thoſe <hi>ſtrange Doctrines,</hi> that he had before preached againſt in general, and ſays, he ſhall mention Eight, the <hi>firſt,</hi> he ſays, <hi>is to deny the Morality of the fourth Commandment,</hi> and then ſays, there are a Sort of <hi>Creatures ariſen up who in open Defiance to God and all good Order, live in the conſtant Breach of an Expreſs Divine Law, by denying the Morality of the fourth Commandment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Barely denying the Morality of the fourth Commandment is not living in a Breach of any Divine Law, for that Law was only given and commanded unto the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> as the reſt of the <hi>Moſaical Law</hi> was, and therefore not moral and perpetual, nor binding to us, becauſe then commanded and written on

Tables of Stone, and put into the Ark; but was ended in Chriſt, who is the true believers Reſt, and is the Anti-tipe of the Jewiſh Sabbath; for that was but a Tipe, Signe and Shadow, therefore not Moral and Perpetual, See <hi>Ezek</hi> 20.12. <hi>Coll.</hi> 2.17. but <hi>John Graham</hi> ſays, <hi>that all the Laws given in the Old Teſtament, are to be diſtinguiſhed in regard of their continuance,</hi> into theſe two ſorts, 1ſt, Perpetual, bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all Men in all Ages, 2<hi>dly,</hi> Tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, binding only ſuch as lived before the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and then conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des this to be of the firſt Sort; but that I deny; and though he has pretended to prove it, yet falls ſhort in his Proof; for though he ſays, <hi>This Precept was given to</hi> Adam <hi>in innocency,</hi> and for his Proof quotes <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.2. Yet there he is much not beſide the Matter; for that Scripture relates matter of Fact, how that God made all things in Six Days, and reſted the Seventh, but is no command at all, neither to <hi>Adam,</hi> nor any of this Poſterity, neither is there any command for the keeping of a Sabbath, to be found in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture given to any People but only to the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002508_0008_0FDB67310A664310"/>
Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and therefore not binding to any other People; for what the Law ſaith, it ſaith to them that are under the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aw. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19 but we are not under the Law, but under Grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. But he ſays, it was one of the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, and therefore concluded it muſt be binding as well as the other Nine <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which I ſay, the other Nine, are not binding to us, becauſe then command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> &amp;c. but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are naturally Moral and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Precepts, and belong to the Chriſtian Religion, and without the Obſervance of which we cannot be good Chriſtians, but we may without keeping the Jewiſh Sabbath or Seventh Day of the Week, which was the Sabbath commanded by that Law or Ten Commandments. Now though <hi>J. G.</hi> ſays in Page 15. that it is binding to all Men in all Ages, yet in Page 29. He ſays, becauſe the Jew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſh Sabbaths were then annulled. See how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory this is, ſo that now we may ſay, that he himſelf has denied the Morality and Perpetuity of the fourth Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but his Shift for this is, that it was
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002508_0009_0FDB67328977B4C0"/>
altered from the Seventh to the Firſt Day of the Week after Chriſts Reſurrection, but can prove no ſuch thing, although he ſtrives hard for it, yet when he has done all he can, he only proves, that after Chriſts Reſurrection the Apoſtles and pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Believers met together on the Firſt Day of the Week for the Worſhip of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And ſo do we, and more than that, we refrain from Bodily Labour; and what does <hi>J. G.</hi> and his Brethren more? So what does he cavil at? we keep the ſame Day as he does, and to the ſame Ends, ſo that he might have ſpared his Pains and long Stories on that Score from Page 14 to 35. moſt part of which is not worth reading, ſo I ſhall ſay no more to thoſe two of this ſtrange Doctrines, ſeeing if they are ſo, he is guilty as well as we. His 3d ſtrange Doctrine is to deny the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Ten Commandments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> We do not deny the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments nor any other Part of the Old or New Teſtament, but highly eſteem them, as the Apoſtle ſaid, to be profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Doctrine, Reproof, Correction and Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs, and we do
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002508_0010_0FDB6736F4D4FE70"/>
frequently give good Proof thereof by Quoting them in our Writings and Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, as will plainly appear by our Friends Books, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore this is a wrong charge and Reflection on us, undeſerved.</p>
            <p>His 4th ſtrange Doctrine is to aſſert the Spirit or Light within, in Oppoſition to the Scripture, to be the only Guide.</p>
            <p>

So they are a good Secondary Rule and Guide, but the Holy Spirit is the firſt and beſt, ſeeing it was before the Scripture, and the Scriptures proceeded from it, therefore muſt be inferiour to it, but <hi>J.

Title to the Scriptures, as is given to Chriſt the Son of God, who by way of Excellency is called the Word of God? And though <hi>J. G.</hi> ſays, the Light the Heathens had in them was Darkneſs, yet I cannot agree to that, neither doth <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.18. prove any ſuch thing, only that ſome of the wicked Heathens had their underſtandings darkned, and that was for want of taking heed to the Light and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in it, whilſt it ſhined into their Hearts, and would have manifeſted the Deeds of Darkneſs; but he ſays, the Light within is every Mans pretence, and in moſt a falſe Light, and in one contrary to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.</p>

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Light of Chriſt which we pretend to and bear Teſtimony of is not a falſe Light in any, but is the Light of life in all and is not in one contrary to what it is in another, but is one and the ſame in all and in full Unity, and makes manifeſt the Deeds of darkneſs in all that take heed unto it; and the Primitive believers did take heed unto it, and were therefore Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Apoſtle, and I deſire that we may alſo take heed unto it when it

            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> If this be Strange Doctrine then Chriſt himſelf and his Apoſtles held and taught Strange doctrine as well as we, and ſo we have good Company, for Chriſt taught his Diſciples Prefection, be ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore perfect as your Father that is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is Perfect <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.4, and the Diſciple is not above his Maſter, but every one that is perfect ſhall be as his Maſter, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.4. and the Apoſtles in many Places, exhorted the Believers to be perfect, and declared they were perfect <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 26.2. <hi>Cor</hi> 13.11. <hi>Ephes</hi> 4, 12.13.

Theſe with many more Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that might be mentioned, do very plainly prove that Chriſt and his Apoſtles held the Doctrine of ſinleſs Perfection at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainable in this Life, and that they did experience it, and yet <hi>J G.</hi> has the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, to ſay, that it is contrary to the daily Experience of the moſt Holy Men

alive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neither did <hi>Paul</hi> ever diſclaim Perfection, though there was a Time when he had not attained it, nevertheleſs, he then followed after and did afterwards at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it; nor does he declare Perfection to be reſerved to a future State, as <hi>J. G.</hi> ſays, quoting for his Proof 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9, 10, 12. Which Place ſpeaks nothing of any other future State then in this Life.</p>
            <p>His 6<hi>th ſtrange Doctrine</hi> is to <hi>hold total and final Apoſtacy</hi> from <hi>true Grace</hi>; by which I underſtand, he means to hold, that good Men that have received true Grace, may fall from it, looſe it, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come wicked, and ſo be loſt or caſt away.</p>
            <p>Now if I cannot plainly prove this by plain Scripture Teſtimony, then I ſhall be contented to own, that I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to held <hi>ſtrange Doctrine,</hi> but if I do prove it to be true <hi>Chriſtian Doctrine,</hi> it will follow, that he holds <hi>ſtrange Doctrine,</hi> in holding the contrary.

his Sin,</hi> and the <hi>Righteous shall live by his Righteousneſs,</hi> and that <hi>the Son shall not bear the Iniquity of his</hi> Father, and <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. ſays <hi>but when the Righteous turneth away from his Righteouſneſs, and committeth Iniquity, and doeth according to all the Abominations that the wicked Man doth, shall he live? All his Righteouſneſs that he hath done shall not be mentioned, in his Treſspaſs that he hath Treſspaſſed, and in his Sin that he hath Sinned, in them shall he die,</hi> And verſ. 26 is to the ſame purpoſe. <hi>And John</hi> 15. Chriſt calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the <hi>true Vine,</hi> and his Father the <hi>Husband-man,</hi> and his Diſciples the <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi> and ſays, <hi>Every Branch in me that beareth not Fruit, he taketh away.</hi> Now certainly thoſe Branches that are in Chriſt, have true Grace, and when they are taken away, they looſe it. This the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> alſo confirms, in the 11th Chap. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> where he ſays, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6. <hi>For if the firſt Fruit be Holy, the Lump is alſo Holy, and if the Root be Holy, So are the Branches.</hi> So that thoſe that are Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in Chriſt, the heavenly Vine, the Root of <hi>David,</hi> the bright and Morning

Star, are in a State of Grace, or have true Grace; and when they are taken away, they looſe it, even by departing from the Faith, and making Shipwreck of it, and of a good Conſcience, as <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Alexander</hi> did, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20. See here is matter of Fact proved, <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> had Faith and a good Conſcience, which none can have but by the Grace of God, and they had fallen from it. This appears further by what the Apoſtle ſays, in his Compariſon concerning the Olive-Tree, and being Grafted into it, and taken away again, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>Well becauſe of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelief they were broken off, and thou ſtandeſt by Faith, be not high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded, but fear; for if God ſpared not the natural Branches, take heed leſt he alſo ſpare not thee: Behold therefore the goodneſs and ſeverity of God; to them which fell Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, but towards thee Goodneſs, if thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in his Goodneſs, otherwiſe thou alſo shalt be cut off: And they alſo, if they bide not ſtill in Unbelief, shall be graffed in; for God is able to graff them in again.</hi>

and looſe it, through Sin, Unbelief and Unwatchfulneſs, and afterwards may, through Repentance and turning from Evil, and forſaking it, come into a State of Grace and Favour with God again. And this will further appear by <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.15. 25. Where the Author exhorts to dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence <hi>leſt any Man fail of</hi> (or fall from) <hi>the Grace of God</hi>; therefore he thought it poſſible to fall from true Grace; for the Grace of God is true Grace; otherwiſe that Exhortation had been needleſs And <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5.6. and 10.26, 29. with many more Scriptures, hold forth the ſame Doctrine very plainly. So that it is no <hi>ſtrange Doctrine,</hi> but a <hi>true Chriſtian Doctrine</hi>; but the contrary Doctrine, <hi>i. e. Once in Grace, and ever in Grace,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a very ſtrange Doctrine, and quite contrary to the whole Tenour of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, from one end to the other, and to the Teachings of Chriſt and his Apoſtles; for Chriſt Taught his Diſciples to <hi>Watch and Pray, leaſt they should enter into Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> which would have been needleſs, had there been no danger; he alſo exhorted them to <hi>abide in him,</hi> and <hi>that his Word

might abide in them</hi>; and much more to the ſame Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>But <hi>J. G.</hi> ſays, <hi>Whom God loves, he loves to the end.</hi> Very true, if they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in his Love, in his Fear, in his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, <hi>John</hi> 15.4.6, 7, and none can pluck them out of his Hand, but if they forſake him, he will forſake them; for it is only thoſe that hold out to the end that ſhall be ſaved. Therefore it is good for all to be watchful and careful, even ſuch as have attained to a good Eſtate in Grace, and in the Love and Favour of God, and not be preſumptuous, thinking it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to fall away; for the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſuppoſed it poſſible for him, when he ſaid <hi>I keep under my Body, and bring it into Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, leſt that by any means, when I have preached to others, I my ſelf should be a caſt away,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.27.

            <p>His 7<hi>th Strange Doctrine,</hi> is, <hi>to hold that human Learning is not a neceſſary Qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation for a Goſpel Miniſter.</hi>

Miniſters, who had it not? For we read, that they were unlearned and ignorant Men, not only before they were called and ſent forth to be Miniſters, but alſo after Chriſts Reſurrection, as we may ſee <hi>Acts</hi> 4.13. So that they had not humane Learning in an ordinary, nor extraordinary Way nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for the pouring forth of the Holy Ghoſt on them, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. was not humane Learning. So it is plain, God did not only imploy one Perſon without it, but many; and I cannot find that it was ever counted neceſſary by Chriſt nor his Apoſtle, did not Chriſt ſay, <hi>I thank thee O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the Wiſe and Prudent, and haſt revealed them unto Babes,</hi> Mat. 11.25. And did not <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, that <hi>God had made Foolish, the Wisdom of this World,</hi> and that the <hi>World by Wiſdom did not know God.</hi> Neither is it any Reflection on the Wiſdom of God, but much exalts it; and the contrary is rather a Reflection on the Wiſdom of God, as if he could not Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and fit his Miniſters for his Work and Service, by his Holy Spirit, without being beholden to Men to teach them <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane

they overcame the evil one, and by which their Hearts were purified and were made free from Sin, and became the Servants of Righteouſneſs, and brought forth Fruit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Holineſs; for <hi>if the Son make you free, then shall you be free indeed,</hi> John 8.36. but he that committeth Sin, is the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Sin, and ſo not made free; and no wonder that ſuch plead for Sin and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sinleſs perfection, and call the <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Perfection</hi> a ſtrange Doctrine.</p>
