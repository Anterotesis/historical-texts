            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS the Captivity of Benjamin Gilbert's Family has been a Subject of much Inquiry, and many of their Friends were anxious to have a particular Account of their Sufferings; the following Narrative is preſented to them and the Public, reciting the Tranſactions as circumſtantially as could be furniſhed from Memory, after comparing Accounts with each other on their Return from Canada.</p>
            <p>That their Lives were preſerved through the many threatning Scenes they paſſed, whilſt in the Hands of the Indians, is to be aſcribed, with Gratitude and Thankfulneſs, to the great Ruler of the Univerſe, who can ſay unto the Sea, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>Thus far ſhalt thou go, and no further.<g ref="char:endq">”</g> And though Benjamin Gilbert, the Elder, was permitted to ſink under the Weight of his Fatigue and Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:018497_0003_0FA7A930E28DAC30"/>
he lived to be reſtored to Liberty, and breathed his laſt in the Arms of his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Wife.</p>
            <p>To be caſt into the Power of Savages, who, from Infancy, are taught a Hardneſs of Heart, which deprives them of the common Feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Humanity, is enough to intimidate the firmeſt Mind: But when we hear of help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Women and Children torn from their Homes, and dragged into the Wilderneſs, we ſhudder at the Thought, and are bound to acknowledge our infinite Obligations to the Almighty, that <hi>we</hi> are ſo much more enlightened than theſe unhappy Wretches of the Deſert; to moſt of whom, the Glad-Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of the Goſpel remains yet to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed: <g ref="char:startq">“</g>Glory to God in the Higheſt; on Earth Peace and good Will to Men.<g ref="char:endq">”</g>

            <head>A NARRATIVE OF THE CAPTIVITY OF BENJAMIN GILBERT AND HIS FAMILY.</head>
            <p>BENJAMIN GILBERT, Son of Joſeph Gilbert, was born at Byberry, about 15 Miles from the City of Philadelphia, in the Year 1711, and received his Education among the People called Quakers.</p>
            <p>He reſided at or near the Place of his Nativity for ſeveral Years; during which Time of Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he married, and after the Deceaſe of his firſt Wife, he accompliſhed a ſecond Marriage with Elizabeth Peart, Widow of Bryan Peart, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in this Neighbourhood until the Year 1775, when he removed with his Family to a Farm ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate on Mahoning Creek, in Penn Townſhip, North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton County, being the Frontiers of Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018497_0005_0FA7A934508270C0"/>
not far from where Fort Allen was erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Improvements he carried on here were according to the uſual Manner of new Settlements, Convenience being principally attended to; his Houſe and Barn being of Logs, to this he had added a Saw-Mill and a commodious Stone Griſt-Mill, which, as it commanded the Country for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Diſtance, conduced in ſome Meaſure to render his Situation comfortable.</p>
            <p>This ſhort Account may not be improper, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to intereſt our Feelings in the Relation of the many Scenes of Affliction the Family were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to, when ſnatched from the pleaſing enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Neceſſaries and Conveniencies of Life. The moſt flattering of our Proſpects are often marked with Diſappointment, expreſſively inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us that we are all Strangers and Sojourners here, as were our Forefathers.</p>
            <p>This Family was alarmed on the 25th Day of the 4th Month, 1780, about Sun-riſe, by a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of eleven Indians, whoſe Appearance ſtruck them with Terror; to attempt and Eſcape was Death, and a Portion of Diſtreſs not eaſy to be ſupported, the certain Attendant on the moſt patient and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive Conduct. The Indians who made this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion, were of different Tribes or Nations, who had abandoned their Country on the Approach of General Sullivan's Army, and fled within Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Britiſh Forts in Canada, promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſettling within their Neighbourhood, and, according to Indian Cuſtom of carrying on War, frequently invading the Frontier Settlements, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Captive the weak and defenceleſs.</p>
            <p>The Names of theſe Indians, with their reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive Tribes, are as follow:

an Hour, during which Time the reſt of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors employed themſelves in plundering the Houſe, and packing up ſuch Goods as they choſe to carry off, until they had got together a ſufficient Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for three Horſes which they took, beſides compelling the diſtreſſed Priſoners to carry Part of their Plunder. When they had finiſhed plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, they began their Retreat, two of their Number being detached to fire the Buildings, which they did without any Exception of thoſe belonging to the unhappy Sufferers; thereby aggravating their Diſtreſſes, as they could obſerve the Flames, and the falling in of the Roofs, from an adjoining Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence called Summer Hill. They caſt a mournful Look towards their Dwellings, but were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſtop, until they had reached the further Side of the Hill, where the Party ſat down to make a ſhort Repaſt; but Grief prevented the Priſoners from ſharing with them.</p>
            <p>The Indians ſpeedily put forwards from this Place; as they apprehended they were not ſo far removed from the Settlements as to be ſecure from Purſuit. Not much further was a large Hill called Mochunk, which they fixed upon for a Place of Rendezvous: Here they halted near an Hour, and prepared Shoes or Sandals, which they call Mockaſons, for ſome of the Children: Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering themſelves in ſome Degree relieved from Danger, their Fears abated ſo that they could enjoy their Meal at Leiſure, which they ate very heartily. At their Removal from this Hill, they told the Priſoners that Col. Butler was no great Diſtance from them, in the Woods, and that they were going to him.</p>
            <p>Near the Foot of the Hill flows a Stream of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter called Mochunk Creek, which was croſſed, and the ſecond Mountain paſſed; the ſteep and difficult

Aſcent of which appeared very great to the much enfeebled and affrighted Captives: They were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to reſt themſelves for ſome Minutes, and then preſſed onwards to the Broad Mountain, at the Foot of which runs Neſcaconnah Creek.</p>
            <p>Doubly diſtreſſed by a Recollection of paſt Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and a Dread of the Miſeries they had now to undergo, they began the Aſcent of this Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with great Anguiſh both of Mind and Body. Benjamin Gilbert's Wife, diſpirited with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing Difficulties, did not expect ſhe was able to paſs this Mountain of Foot; but being threatened with Death by the Indians if ſhe did not perform it, with many a heavy Step ſhe at length ſucceeded. The Broad Mountain is ſaid to be 7 Miles over in this Place, and about 10 Miles diſtant from Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin Gilbert's Settlement. Here they halted an Hour, and then ſtruck into the Neſkapeck Path; the Unevenneſs and Ruggedneſs of which, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it exceedingly toilſome, and obliged them to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ove forwards ſlowly. Quackac Creek runs acroſs the Neſkapeck Path, which leads over Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire Hill. At this laſt Place they ſtopped to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſh themſelves, and then purſued their March along the ſame Path, thro' Moravian Pine Swamp, to Mahoniah Mountain, where they lodged, being the firſt Night of their Captivity.</p>
            <p>It may furniſh Information to ſome, to mention the Method the Indians generally uſe to ſecure their Priſoners: They cut down a Sapling as large as a Man's Thigh, and therein cut Notches, in which they fix their Legs, and over this they place a Pole, croſſing the Pole on each Side with Stakes drove in the Ground, and in the Crotches of the Stakes they place other Poles or Riders, effectually con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſining the Priſoners on their Backs; beſides which, they put a Strap round their Necks, which they
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018497_0009_0FA7A936E2C9BF18"/>
faſten to a Tree: In this Manner the Night paſſed. Their Beds were Hemlock Branches ſtrewed on the Ground, and Blankets for a Covering, which was an Indulgence ſcarcely to have been expected from Savages: It may reaſonably be expected, that in this melancholy Situation, Sleep was a Stranger to their Eye-lids.</p>
            <p>Benjamin Peart having fainted in the Evening, occaſioned by the Sufferings he endured, was threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be tomhawked by Rowland Monteur.</p>
            <p n="26">26<hi>th.</hi> Early this Morning they continued their Route, near the Waters of Teropin Ponds. The Indians thought it moſt eligible to ſeparate the Priſoners in Companies of two by two, each Company under the Command of a particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, ſpreading them to a conſiderable Diſtance, in order to render a Purſuit as impracticable as poſſible. The old People, overcome with Fatigue, could not make as much Expedition as their ſevere Taſk-maſters thought proper, but failed in their Journey, and were therefore threatned with Death, by the Indian under whoſe Direction they were placed: Thus circumſtanced, they reſigned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to their unhappy Lot, with as much Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude as poſſible. Towards Evening the Parties again met and encamped, having killed a Deer, they kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled a Fire, each one roaſting Pieces of the Fleſh up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſharpened Switches. The Confinement of the Captives was the ſame with the firſt Night, but, as they were by this Time more reſigned to the Event, they were not altogether deprived of Sleep.</p>
            <p n="27">27<hi>th.</hi> After Breakfaſt a Council was held con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Diviſion of the Priſoners, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſettled, they delivered each other thoſe Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers who fell within their ſeveral Allotments, giving them Directions to attend to the particular Indians whoſe Property they became. In this Day's Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018497_0010_0FA7A937A44A6F90"/>
they paſſed near Fort Wyoming, on the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Branch of Suſquehanna, about forty Miles from their late Habitation. The Indians, naturally timid, were alarmed as they approached this Garriſon, and obſerved great Caution, not ſuffering any Noiſe, but ſtepped on the Stones that lay in the Path, leſt any Footſteps ſhould lead to a Diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Not far from thence is a conſiderable Stream of Water, emptying itſelf into Suſquehanna, which they croſſed with great Difficulty, it being deep and rapid, and continued here this Night. Benjamin Gilbert being bound faſt with Cords, underwent great Sufferings.</p>
            <p n="28">28<hi>th.</hi> This Morning the Priſoners were all paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed according to the Cuſtom among the Indians, ſome of them with red and black, ſome all red, and ſome with black only: Thoſe whom they ſmut with black, without any other Colour, are not conſidered of any Value, and are by this Mark generally devoted to Death: Although this cruel Purpoſe may not be executed immediately, they are ſeldom preſerved to reach the Indian Hamlets alive. In the Evening they came to Suſquehanna, having had a painful and weariſome Journey through a very ſtony and hilly Path. Here the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians ſought diligently for a private Lodging-place, that they might be as ſecure as poſſible from any Scouting-parties of the white People. It is unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make further Mention of their Manner of Lodging, as it ſtill remained the ſame.</p>
            <p n="29">29<hi>th.</hi> They went in Search of the Horſes which had ſtrayed from them in the Night, and after ſome Time found them. They then kept the Courſe of the River, walking along its Side with Difficulty. In the Afternoon they came to a Place where the Indians had directed four Negroes to wait their Return, having leſt them ſome Corn for a Subſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018497_0011_0FA7A93862A09408"/>
Theſe Negroes had eſcaped from Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and were on their Way to Niagara, when firſt diſcovered by the Indians; being challenged by them, anſwered "They were for the King," upon which they immediately received them into Protection.</p>
            <p n="30">30<hi>th.</hi> The Negroes who were added to the Company the Day before, began cruelly to domineer and tyrannize over the Priſoners, frequently whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping them for their Sport, and treating them with more Severity than even the Indians themſelves; having had their Hearts hardened by the Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Condition, and long Subjection to Slavery. In this Day's Journey they paſſed the Remains of the Indian Town, Wyalooſing. The Lands round theſe Ruins have a remarkable Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Fertility. In the Evening they made a Lodgement by the Side of a large Creek.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>th.</hi> Month 1<hi>ſt</hi> After croſſing a conſiderable Hill in the Morning, they came to a Place where two Indians lay dead. A Party of Indians had taken ſome white People, whom they were carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off Priſoners, they roſe upon the Indians in the Night, killed four of them, and then effected their Eſcape. The Women were ſent forwards, and the Men-Priſoners commanded to draw near and view the two dead Bodies, which remained; (the other two being removed) they ſtaid to obſerve them a conſiderable Time, and were then order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a Place where a Tree was blown down. Death appeared to be their Doom; but after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining in a State of ſad Suſpenſe for ſome Time, they were ordered to dig a Grave; to effect which, they cut a Sapling with their Tomhawks, and ſharpened on End, with which wooden Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment one of them broke the Ground, and the others caſt the Earth out with their Hands, the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018497_0012_0FA7A939244293D8"/>
being permitted to beat them ſeverely whilſt they were thus employed. After interring the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, they went forwards to the reſt, and overtook them as they were preparing for their Lodging. They were not yet releaſed from their Sapling Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>d.</hi> Having ſome of their Proviſions with them, they made an early Meal, and travelled the whole Day. They croſſed the Eaſt Branch of Suſquehan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na towards Evening, in Canoes, at the Place where General Sullivian's Army had paſſed it in their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition. Their Encampment was on the Weſtern Side of this Branch of the River; but two Indians who did not croſs it, ſent for Benjamin Gilbert, jun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Jeſſe Gilbert's Wife, and as no probable Cauſe could be aſſigned why it was ſo, the Deſign was conſidered as a very dark one, and was a grievous Affliction to the others.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>d.</hi> The Morning however diſpelled their Fears, when they had the Satisfaction of ſeeing them again, and underſtood they had not received any Treatment harder than their uſual Fare. The Horſes ſwam the Suſquehanna, by the Side of the Canoe. This Day the Indians in their March found a Scalp, and took it along with them, as alſo ſome old Corn, of which they made a Supper. They frequently killed Deer, and by that Means ſupplied the Company with Meat, being almoſt the only Proviſion they ate, as the Flour they took with them was expended.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>th.</hi> The Path they travelled this Morning was but little trodden, which made it difficult for thoſe who were not acquainted with the Woods to keep in it. They croſſed a Creek, made up a large Fire to warm themſelves by, and then ſeparated into two Companies, the one taking the Weſtward Path, with whom were Thomas Peart, Joſeph Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018497_0013_0FA7A939E5C6F1B8"/>
Benjamin Gilbert jun. and Jeſſe Gilbert's Wife Sarah; the others went more to the North, over rich level Land. When Evening came, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry was made concerning the four Captives who were taken in the Weſtward Path, and they were told, that <g ref="char:startq">“</g>Theſe were killed and ſcalped, and you may expect the ſame Fate to Night.<g ref="char:endq">”</g>

            <p n="5">5<hi>th.</hi> In the Morning the Indians returned; their Search for Andrew Harrigar being happily for him unſucceſsful: The Priſoners who remained, were therefore treated with great Severity on Account of his Eſcape, and were often accuſed of being privy to his Defign. Capt. Rowland Monteur, carried his Reſentment ſo far, that he threw Jeſſe Gilbert down, and lifted his Tomhawk to ſtrike him, which the Mother prevented, by putting her Head on his Forehead, beſeeching him to ſpare her Son: This ſo enraged him, that he turned round, kicked her over, and tied them both by their Necks to a Tree, where they remained until his Fury was a little abated; he then looſed them, and not long after bid them pack up and go forwards. They paſſed through a large Pine Swamp, and about Noon reached one of the Kittareen Towns, which was deſolated. Not far from this Town, on the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of a Mountain, there iſſues a large Spring,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018497_0014_0FA7A39AA46663D0"/>
forming a very conſiderable Fall, and runs very rapidly in an irregular winding Stream down the Mountain's Sides. They left this Place, and took up their Lodging in a deſerted Wigwam covered with Bark, which had formerly been Part of the Town of the Shipquagas.</p>
            <p n="6">6<hi>th,</hi> 7<hi>th,</hi> 8<hi>th,</hi> They continued theſe three Days in the Neighbourhood of theſe Villages, which had been deſerted upon General Sullivan's Approach. Here they lived well, having in Addition to their uſual Bill of Fare, plenty of Turnips and Potatoes, which had remained in the Ground, unnoticed by the Army. This Place was the Hunting-Ground of the Shipquagas, and whenever their Induſtry prompted them to go out hunting, they had no Difficulty to procure as many Deer as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired.</p>
            <p>Roaſt and boiled Meat, with Vegetables, afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them plentiful Meals: they alſo caught a wild Turkey, and ſome Fiſh, called Suckers. Their Manner of catching Fiſh, was, to ſharpen a Stick, and watch along the Rivers until a Fiſh came near them, when they ſuddenly pierced him with the Stick, and brought him out of the Water.</p>
            <p>Here were a Number of Colts, ſome of them were taken, and the Priſoners ordered to manage them, which was not eaſily done.</p>
            <p n="9">9<hi>th,</hi> When they renewed their March, they placed the Mother upon a Horſe that ſeemed dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to ride, but ſhe was preſerved from any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. In this Day's Journey they came to Meadow Ground, where they ſtaid the Night, the Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confined as before related, and the Negroes lay near them for a Guard.</p>
            <p n="10">10<hi>th.</hi> A wet Swamp, that was very troubleſome, lay in their Road; after which they had to paſs a rugged Mountain, where there was no Path. The

Underbruſh made it hard Labour for the Women to travel; but no Excuſe would avail with their ſevere Maſters, and they were compelled to keep up with the Indians, however great the Fatigue: When they had paſſed it, they tarried awhile for the Negroes who had lagged behind, having ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="11">11<hi>th.</hi> A long Reach of Savannas and low Ground, rendered this Day's Route very fatigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and painful, eſpecially to the Women: Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Peart's Huſband not being allowed to relieve her by carrying the Child, her Spirits and Strength were ſo exhauſted that ſhe was ready to faint; the Indian under whoſe Care ſhe was, obſerving her Diſtreſs, gave her a violent Blow. When we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Temper and Cuſtoms of theſe People, with thoſe of our own Colour, how much Cauſe have we to be thankful for the Superiority we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from the Bleſſings of Civilization.</p>
            <p>It might truly be ſaid, Days of bitter Sorrow, and weariſome Nights were appointed the unhappy Captives.</p>
            <p n="12">12<hi>th.</hi> Their Proviſions began to grow ſcant, having paſt the hunting Grounds: The Want of proper Food to ſupport them, which might render them more capable of enduring their daily Fatigue, was a heavy Trial, and was much increaſed by their Confinement at Night. Elizabeth Gilbert was reduced ſo low, that ſhe travelled in great Pain all this Day, riding on Horſe-back in the Morning, but towards Evening ſhe was ordered to alight, and walk up a Hill they had to aſcend; the Pain ſhe ſuffered, together with Want of Food, ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came her, that ſhe was ſeized with a Chill: The Indians adminiſtered ſome Flour and Water boiled, which afforded her ſome Relief.</p>

            <p n="14">14<hi>th.</hi> The Mother had ſuffered ſo much, that two of her Children were obliged to lead her. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Noon they came to Canadoſago, where they met with Benjamin Gilbert, jun. and Jeſſe Gilbert's Wife Sarah, two of the four who had been ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from them ten Days paſt, and taken along the Weſtern Path: This Meeting afforded them great Satisfaction; the Doubt and Uncertainty of their Lives being ſpared, often diſtreſſing their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate Relations.</p>
            <p>John Huſton, jun the Indian under whoſe Care Benjamin Gilbert was placed, deſigning to diſpatch him, painted him black; this exceedingly terrified the Family, but no Intreaties of theirs being likely to prevail, they reſigned their Cauſe to him whoſe Power can controul all Events. Wearied with their Weakneſs and travelling, they made a Stop to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover themſelves, when the Pilot returning, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them they ſhould ſoon receive ſome Proviſions. The Negroes were reduced ſo low with Hunger, that their Behaviour was different from what it had been, conducting with more Moderation. At their Quarters in the Evening, two white Men came to them, one of which was a Volunteer amongſt the Britiſh, the other had been taken Priſoner ſome Time before; theſe two Men brought ſome Hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

found, they made a more comfortable Supper than they had enjoyed for many Days.</p>
            <p n="15">15<hi>th.</hi> In the Morning the Volunteer having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Information of the rough Treatment the Priſoners met with from the Negroes, relieved them, by taking the four Blacks under his Care. It was not without much Difficulty they croſſed a large Creek which was in their Way, being obliged to ſwim the Horſes over it. Benjamin Gilbert be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to fail; the Indian, whoſe Property he was, highly irritated at his Want of Strength, put a Rope about his Neck, leading him along with it; Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue at laſt ſo overcame him, that he fell on the Ground, when the Indian pulled the Rope ſo hard, that he almoſt choaked him: His Wife ſeeing this, reſolutely interceded for him, although the Indians bid her go forwards, as the others had gone on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; this ſhe refuſed to comply with, unleſs her Huſband might be permitted to accompany her; they replied. <g ref="char:startq">“</g>That they were determined to Kill the old Man,<g ref="char:endq">”</g> having before this ſet him apart as a Victim: But at Length her Entrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirs prevailed, and their Hearts were turned from their cruel Purpoſe.

The Priſoners, in the mean Time, were ordered to dig up a Root, ſomething reſembling Potatoes, which the Indians call Whop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies. They tarried at this Place, until towards the Evening of the ſucceeding Day, and made a Soup of wild Onions and Turnip Tops; this they eat without Bread or Salt, it could not therefore af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ſufficient Suſtenance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> either for young or old; their Food being ſo very light, their Strength daily waſted.</p>
            <p n="17">17<hi>th.</hi> They left this Place, and croſſed the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſee River, (which empties its Waters into Lake Ontario) on a Raft of Logs, bound together by Hickory Withes; this appeared to be a dangerous Method of ferrying them over ſuch a River, to thoſe who had been unaccuſtomed to ſuch Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances. They fixed their Station near the Geneſee Banks, and procured more of the wild Potatoe Roots before mentioned, for the Supper.</p>
            <p n="18">18<hi>th.</hi> One of the Indians left the Company, taking with him the fineſt Horſe they had, and in ſome Hours after, returned with a large Piece of Meat, ordering the Captives to boil it; this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand they cheerfully performed, anxiouſly watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Kettle, freſh Meat being a Rarity which they had not eat for a long Time: The Indians, when it was ſufficiently boiled, diſtributed to each one a Piece, eating ſparingly themſelves. The Priſoners made their Repaſt without Bread or Salt, and eat with a good Reliſh, what they ſuppoſed to be freſh Beef, but afterwards underſtood it was Horſe-Heſh.</p>
            <p>A ſhrill Halloo which they heard, gave the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners ſome Uneaſineſs; one of the Indians imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately rode to examine the Cauſe, and ſound it

was Capt. Rowland Monteur, and his Bother John's Wiſe, with ſome other Indians, who were ſeeking them with Proviſion. The Remainder of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſoon reached them, and they divided ſome Bread, which they had brought, into ſmall Pieces, according to the Number of the Company.</p>
            <p>Here is a large Extent of rich farming Land, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for is Levelneſs and beautiful Meadows.

            <p>The Captain and his Company had brought with them Cakes of Hommony and Indian Corn; of this they made a good Meal. He appeared pleaſed to ſee the Priſoners, having been abſent from them ſeveral Days, and ordered them all round to ſhake hands with him.

            <p n="19">19<hi>th.</hi> Pounding Hommony was this Day's Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, the Weather being warm, made it a hard Taſk; they boiled and prepared it for Supper, the Indians ſetting down to eat firſt, and when they had concluded their Meal, they wiped the Spoon on the Soal of their Mockaſons, and then gave it to the Captives: Hunger alone could prevail on any one to eat after ſuch Filth and Naſtineſs.</p>

ſtill continued through rich Meadow. After wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering for a Time out of the direct Path, they came to an Indian Town, and obtained the neceſſary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation to purſue their Journey: the Indians ran out of their Huts to ſee the Prifoners<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the Plunder, but no Part of it ſuited them. Being directed to travel the Path back again, for a ſhort Diſtance, they did ſo, and then ſtruck into another, and went on untill Night, by which Time they were very hungry, not having eat ſince Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; the Kettle was again ſet on the Fire, for Hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, this being their only Food.</p>
            <p n="21">21<hi>ſt.</hi> The Report of a Morning-Gun from Nia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they heard, contributed to raiſe their Hopes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they rejoiced at being ſo near. An Indian was diſpatched on Horſe-back, to procure Proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the Fort.</p>
            <p>Elizabeth Gilbert cold not walk as faſt as the Reſt, ſhe was therefore ſent forwards on Foot, but was ſoon overtaken, and left behind, the Reſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obliged by the Indians to go on without regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her. She would have been greatly perplexed, when ſhe came to a Diviſion-path, had not her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band lain a Branch acroſs the Path which would have led her Wrong: An affecting Inſtance of both Ingenuity and Tenderneſs. She met ſeveral Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who paſſed by without ſpeaking to her.</p>
            <p>An Indian belonging to the Company, who was on the Horſe Elizabeth Gilbert had rode, over-took her, and, as he went on ſlowly, converſing with her, endeavoured to alarm her, by ſaying that ſhe would be left behind, and periſh in the Woods; yet, notwithſtanding this, his Heart was ſo ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before he had gone any great Diſtance from her, that he alighted from the Horſe and left him, that ſhe might be able to reach the Reſt of the Company. The more ſeriouſly ſhe conſidered this,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:018497_0021_0FA7A9866839CE48"/>
the more it appeared to her, to be a convincing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the overruling Protection of him, who can "turn the Heart of Man, as the Huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man turneth the Water-Courſe in his Field."</p>
            <p n="22">22<hi>d.</hi> As the Indians approached nearer their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations, they frequently repeated their Halloos, and after ſome Time, they received an Anſwer in the ſame Manner, which alarmed the Company much; but they ſoon diſcovered it to proceed from a Party of Whites and Indians, who were on ſome Expedition, though their Pretence was, that they were for New-York. Not long after parting with theſe, the Captain's Wife came to them; ſhe was Daughter to Siangorochti, King of the Senecas, but her Mother being a Cayuga, ſhe was ranked among that Nation, the Children generally reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Deſcent from the Mother's Side. This Princeſs was attended by the Captain's Brother John, one other Indian, and a white Priſoner who had been taken at Wyoming, by Rowland Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teur; ſhe was dreſſed altogether in the Indian Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſhining with Gold Lace and Silver Baubles: They brought with them from the Fort a Supply of Proviſion. The Captain being at a Diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, when his Wiſe came, the Company waited for him. After the cuſtomary Salutations, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed himſelf to his Wife, telling her that Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca was her Daughter, and that ſhe muſt not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, by any Conſideration, to part with her; whereupon ſhe took a Silver Ring off her Finger, and put it upon Rebecca, by which ſhe was adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as her Daughter.</p>
            <p>They feaſted upon the Proviſions that were brought, for they had been for ſeveral Days before pinched with Hunger, what Suſtenance they could procure not being ſufficient to ſupport Nature.</p>
            <p n="23">23<hi>d.</hi> Their Spirits were in ſome Degree revived,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018497_0022_0FA7A9872361B188"/>
by the Enjoyment of Plenty, added to the pleaſing Hope of ſome favourable Event procuring their Releaſement, as they were not far diſtant from Nia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara.</p>
            <p>The Indians proceeded on their Journey, and continued whooping in the moſt frightful Manner. In this Day's Route, they met another Company of Indians, who compelled Benjamin Gilbert, the Elder, to ſit on the Ground, and put ſeveral Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions to him, to which he gave them the beſt An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers he could; they then took his Hat from him and went off.</p>
            <p>Going through a ſmall Town near Niagara, an Indian Woman came out of one of the Huts, and ſtruck each of the Captives a Blow. Not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Departure from this Place, Jeſſe, Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, and their Mother, were detained until the others had got out of their Sight, when the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was ordered to puſh on; and as ſhe had to go by herſelf, ſhe was much perplexed what Courſe to take, as there was no Path by which ſhe could be directed: In this Dilemma, ſhe concluded to keep as ſtraight forward as poſſible, and after ſome Space of Time, ſhe had the Satisfaction of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking the others. The Pilot then made a ſhort Stay, that thoſe who were behind might come up, and the Captain handed ſome Rum round, giving each a Dram, except the two old Folks, whom they did not conſider worthy of this No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. Here the Captain, who had the chief Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, painted Abner, Jeſſe, Rebecca, and Elizabeth Gilbert, jun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and preſented each with a Belt of wampum, as a Token of their being received into Favour altho' they took from them all their Hat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> and Bonnets, except Rebecca's.</p>
            <p>The Priſoners were releaſed from the heavy Loads they had heretofore been compelled to carry, and
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:018497_0023_0FA7A987E36E05C8"/>
was it not for the Treatment they expected on their approaching the Indian Towns, and the Hardſhip of a Separation, their Situation would have been tolerable; but the Horror of their Minds, ariſing from the dreadful Yells of the Indians, as they approached the Hamlets, is eaſier conceived than deſcribed, for they were no Strangers to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomary Cruelty exerciſed upon Captives on enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Towns: The Indians, Men Women, and Children collect together, bringing Clubs and Stones, in order to beat them, which they uſually do with great Severity, by Way of Revenge for their Relations who have been ſlain; this is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed immediately upon their entering the Village where the Warriors reſide: This Treatment can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be avoided, and the Blows, however cruel, muſt be borne without Complaint, and the Priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers are ſorely beaten, until their Enemies are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the cruel Sport. Their Sufferings were in this Caſe very great, they received ſeveral Wounds, and two of the Women who were on Horſe-back, were much bruiſed by falling from their Horſes, which were frightned by the Indians. Elizabeth, the Mother, took Shelter by the Side of one them, but upon his obſerving that ſhe met with ſome Favour upon his Account, he ſent her away; ſhe then received ſeveral violent Blows, ſo that ſhe was almoſt diſabled. The Blood trickled from their Heads, in a Stream, their Hair being cropt cloſe, and the Cloaths they had on, in Rags, made their Situation truly piteous: Whilſt they were inflicting this Revenge upon the Captives, the King came, and put a Stop to any further Cruelty, by telling them "It was ſufficient," which they immediately attended to.</p>
            <p>Benjamin Gilbert, and Elizabeth his Wife, Jeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe Gilbert, and his Wife, were ordered to Captain
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:018497_0024_0FA7A988A80AB68"/>
Rowland Monteur's Houſe, the Women belonging to it, were kind to them, and gave them ſomething to eat: Sarah Gilbert, Jeſſe's Wife, was taken from them by three Women, in Order to be placed in the Family ſhe was to be adopted by.</p>
            <p>Two Officers from Niagara Fort, Captains Dace, and Powel, came to ſee the Priſoners, and prevent (as they were informed) any Abuſe that might be given them: Benjamin Gilbert informed theſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, that he was apprehenſive they were in great Danger of being murdered, upon which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him they would ſend a Boat, the next Day, to bring them to Niagara.</p>
            <p n="24">24<hi>th.</hi> Notwithſtanding the kind Intention of the Officers, they did not derive the expected Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from it, for the Indians inſiſted on their going to the Fort on Foot, although the Bruiſes they had received the Day before, from the many ſevere Blows given them, rendered their Journey on Foot very diſtreſſing; but Capt. Monteur obſtinately perſiſting, they dare not long remonſtrate, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe.</p>
            <p>When they left the Indian Town, ſeveral iſſued from their Huts after them, with Sticks in their Hands, yelling and ſcreeching in a moſt diſmal Manner; but through the Interpoſition of four In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Women, who had come with the Captives, to prevent any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ty) the Indians to get into it, with the Captives, which relieved them
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:018497_0025_0FA7A98965021348"/>
from the Apprehenſions of further Danger. After reaching the Fort, Capt. Powel introduced them to Col. Guy Johnſon and Col. Butler, who aſked the Priſoners many Queſtions, in the Preſence of the Indians. They preſented the Captain with a Belt of Wampum, which is a conſtant Practice amongſt them, when they intend a Ratification of the Peace. Before their Connexion with Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans, theſe Belts were made of Shells, found on the Coaſts of New-England and Virginia, which were ſawed out into Beads of an Oblong Shape, about a Quarter of an Inch long, which when ſtrung together on leathern Strings, and theſe Strings faſtened with find threads made of Sinews, compoſe what is called, a Belt of Wampum: But ſince the Whites have gained Footing among them, they make Uſe of the common Glaſs Beads for this Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>The Indians, according to their uſual Cuſtom and Ceremony, at three ſeparate Times, ordered the Priſoners to ſhake Hands with Col. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton.</p>
            <p n="25">25<hi>th.</hi> Benjamin Gilbert, Elizabeth his Wife, and Jeſſe Gilbert, were ſurrendered to Col, John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: This Deliverance from ſuch Scenes of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, as they had become acquainted with, gave them a more free Opportunity of cloſe Reflection than heretofore.</p>
            <p>The many ſorrowful Days and Nights they had paſſed, the painful Anxiety attendant on their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Separation from each other, and the Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Fate of the Reſt of their Family, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed them with Grief.</p>
            <p n="26">26<hi>th.</hi> Expreſſion is too weak to deſcribe their Diſtreſs, on leaving their Children with theſe hard Maſters; they were not unacquainted with many of the Difficulties, to which they would neceſſarily

               </gap>tion, the Kindneſs of Sympathy was awakened in one of the Indian Women, who even forgot her Prejudices, and wiped away the Tears which trickled down Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Gilbert's Cheeks.</p>
            <p>The particular Attention of Col. Johnſon's Houſkeeper to them, from a Commiſeration of their Diſtreſs, claims their Remembrance: Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min, his Wife, and Jeſſe Gilbert, were invited to her Houſe, where ſhe not only gave the old Folks her beſt Room, but adminiſtered to their Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and endeavoured to ſooth their Sorrows.</p>
            <p>Jeſſe Gilbert was favoured to get Employ, which, as it was ſome Alleviation of his Miſfortunes, may be conſidered as a providential Kindneſs.</p>
            <p n="28">28<hi>th.</hi> A few Days after they came to the Fort, they had Information that Benjamin Peart was by the River Side, with the Indians; upon hearing this Reports, his Mother went to ſee him, but every At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for his Releaſe was in Vain, the Indians would by no Means give him up. From this Place they intended to march with their Priſoner, to the Geneſee River, about an Hundred Miles Diſtance. As the affectionate Mother's Solicitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons proved fruitleſs, her Son not only felt the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting Loſs of his Wife and Child, from whom he had been torn ſome Time before, but a Renewal of his Grief, on this ſhort Sight of his Parent: She procured him a Hat, and alſo ſome Salt, which was an acceptable Burden for the Journey.</p>
            <p>Benjamin Gilbert, converſing with the Indian Captain who made them Captives, obſerved that he might ſay what none of the other Indians could, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>That he had brought in the oldeſt Man,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:018497_0027_0FA7A98AE344C730"/>
and the youngeſt Child;<g ref="char:endq">”</g> his Reply to this was expreſſive; <g ref="char:startq">“</g>It was not I, but the great God who brought you through, for we were determined to kill you, but were prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.<g ref="char:endq">”</g>
            </p>
            <p>The Britiſh Officers being acquainted that Jeſſe Gilbert's Wife was among the Indians, with great Tenderneſs agreed to ſeek her out, and after a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Enquiry, found that ſhe was among the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawares, they went to them, and endeavoured to agree upon Terms for her Releaſement; the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans brought her to the Fort the next Day, but would not give her up to her Relations.</p>
            <p n="29">29<hi>th.</hi> As the Cabbins of the Indians were but two Miles from the Fort, they went thither, and Jeſſe and the Officers uſed ever Argument in their Power to prevail upon them, repreſenting how hard it was to part theſe two young People; at Length they conſented to bring her in next Day, with their whole Tribe, for a final Releaſe.</p>
            <p n="30">30<hi>th.</hi> They accordingly came, but ſtarted ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Objections, that ſhe was obliged to return with them.</p>
            <p n="31">31<hi>ſt.</hi> Early next Morning, Capt. Robeſon gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly undertook to procure her Liberty, which, after much Attention and Solicitude, he, together with Liutenant Hillyard, happily accompliſhed. They made the Indians ſeveral ſmall Preſents, and gave them thirty Pounds as a Ranſom.</p>
            <p>When Sarah Gilbert had obtained her Liberty, ſhe altered her Dreſs more in Character for her Sex, then ſhe had been able to do whilſt amongſt the Indians, and went to her Huſband and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents at Col.

procured Clothing for them from the King's Stores.</p>
            <p n="6">6<hi>th</hi> Month 1<hi>ſt.</hi> About this Time, the Senecas, among whom Elizabeth Peart was Captive, brought her with them to the Fort; as ſoon as the Mother heard of it, ſhe went to her, and had ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with her, but could not learn where ſhe was to be ſent to; ſhe then enquired of the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, and preſſed on his Friendſhip, to learn what was to become of her Daughter; this Requeſt he compiled with, and informed her that ſhe was to be given away to another Family of the Senecas, and adopted among them, in the Place of a deceaſed Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               </gap>aſe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and offered to purchaſe her of them, but the Indians refuſed to give her up; and as the Mother and Daughter expected they ſhould ſee each other no more, their Parting was very affecting.</p>
            <p>The Indian Woman who had adopted Rebecca as her Daughter, came alſo to the Fort, and Elizabeth Gilbert made Uſe of this Opportunity to enquire concerning her Daughter, the Interpreter informed her, there was no Probability of obtaining the Enlargement of her Child, as the Indians would not part with her: All ſhe could do, was, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend her to their Notice, as very weakly, and of Conſequence not able to endure much Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>d.</hi> and 3<hi>d.</hi> Not many Days after their Arrival at Niagara, a Veſſel came up Lake Ontario to the Fort, with Orders for the Priſoners to go Montre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. In this Veſſel came one Capt. Brant, an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Chief, high in Rank amongſt them. Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Gilbert immediately applied herſelf to ſolicit and intereſt him on Behalf of her Children who yet remained in Captivity; he readily promiſed her to uſe his Endeavours to procure their Liberty.

A ſhort Time before they ſailed for Montreal, they received Accounts of Abner and Elizabeth Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert the younger, but it was alſo underſtood that their Poſſeſſors were not diſpoſed to give them up.

            <p>Here they became acquainted with one Jeſſe Pawling, from Pennſylvania, who was an Officer among the Britiſh, and behaved with Kindneſs and Reſpect to the Priſoners, which induced them to requeſt his Attention alſo to that Part of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily remaining in Captivity; it appeared to them of ſome Conſequence to gain an additional Friend.

4<hi>th,</hi> The Veſſel ſailed down the Lake, on the ſixth Day of the Week, and on Firſt-day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being the fourth Day of the Sixth Month, 1780, came to Carlton Iſland, where there were ſuch a Number of ſmall Boats, which brought Proviſions, that it had the Appearance of a Fleet. Benjamin Gilbert, and Jeſſe, went on Shore to obtain Leave from the commanding Officer, to go to Montreal in the ſmall Boats, as the Veſſel they came in could proceed no further: They met with a kind Reception and their Requeſt was granted.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>th.</hi> On Second-day following, they left Carl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Iſland, which lies at the Mouth of Lake On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tario, and took their Paſſage in open Boats down the River St. Laurence, and paſſed a Number of ſmall Iſlands. There is a rapid Deſcent in the Waters of this River, which appears dangerous to thoſe unacquainted with theſe Kind of Falls. The French Men who rowed the Boats, kept them near the Shore, and paſſed without much Difficulty between the Rocks.</p>
            <p n="6">6<hi>th,</hi> 7<hi>th,</hi> and 8<hi>th.</hi> Benjamin Gilbert had been much indiſpoſed before they left the Fort, and his Diſorder was increaſed by a Rain which fell on their Paſſage, as they were without any Covering. They paſſed Oſwagatchy, an Engliſh Garriſon, by the Side of the River, but they were not permitted to ſtop here; they proceeded down the St. Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and the Rain continuing, went on Shore on an Iſland in Order to ſecure themſelves from the Weather: Here they made a Shelter for Benjamin Gilbert, and when the Rain ceaſed, a Place was prepared for him in the Boat, that he might lie down with more Eaſe. His bodily Weakneſs made ſuch rapid Progreſs, that it rendered all the Care and Attention of his Wife neceſſary, and likewiſe
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:018497_0031_0FA7A98F657D7150"/>
called forth all her Fortitude; ſhe ſupported him in her Arms, affording every poſſible Relief to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate his extreme Pains: And although in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Condition, he, notwithſtanding, gave a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory Evidence of the Virtue and Power of a patient and holy Reſignation, which can diſarm the King of Terrors, and receive him as a welcome Meſſenger: Thus prepared, he paſſed from this State of Probation, the eighth Day of the Sixth Month, 1780, in the Evening, leaving his Wife and two Children, who were with him, in all the Anxiety of deep Diſtreſs, although they had no Doubt but that their Loſs was his everlaſting Gain. Being without a Light in the Boat, the Darkneſs of the Night added not a little to their melancholy Situation. As there were not any others with Elizabeth Gilbert but her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and the four French Men who managed the Boat, and her Apprehenſions alarmed her, leſt they ſhould throw the Corps overboad, as the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be an unfeeling Company, ſhe therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to ſome Britiſh Officers who were in a Boat behind them, who diſpelled her Fears, and receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her under their Protection.</p>

Squire Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell, who had the Charge of the Priſoners, when he heard of Benjamin Gilbert's Deceaſe, ſent Jeſſe to the Commandant of this Garriſon to get a Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin, in which they put the Corps, and very haſtily interred him under an Oak not far from the Fort. The Boat-men would not allow his Widow to pay the laſt Tribute to his Memory, but regardleſs of her Affliction, refuſed to wait; her Diſtreſs on this Occaſion was great indeed, but being ſenſible that it was her Duty to ſubmit to the Diſpenſations of

            <p>Near this Place they paſſed by a Griſt-mill, which is maintained by a Stone Wing extended into the River St. Laurence, the Stream being very rapid, acquires a Force ſufficient to turn the Wheel, without the further Expence of a Dam.</p>
            <p>The Current carried their Boat forwards with amazing Rapidity, and the Falls became ſo dangerous that the Boats could proceed no further; they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore landed in the Evening, and went to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Officer of Fort Laſheen to requeſt a Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but the Houſes in the Garriſon were ſo crowded, that it was with Difficulty they obtained a ſmall Room belonging to the Boat-builders to retire to, and here they ſtowed themſelves with ten others.</p>
            <p n="10">10<hi>th.</hi> The Garriſon of Laſheen is on the Iſle of Jeſu, on which the Town of Montreal ſtands, about the Diſtance of nine miles; hither our Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers had to go by Land, and as they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely unacquainted with the Road, they took the Advantage of an empty Cart (which was going to the Town) for the Women to ride in.</p>
            <p>The Land in this Neighbourhood is very ſtony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Soil thin; the Cattle ſmall, and ill favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>When they arrived at Montreal, they were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to Brigadier General M'Clean, who after examining them, ſent them to one Duqueſne, an Officer amongſt the Loyaliſts, who being from Home, they were deſired to wait in the Yard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he came; this Want of Politeneſs, gave them no favourable Impreſſions of the Maſter of the

Houſe; when he returned, he read their Paſs, and gave Jeſſe an Order for three Days Proviſions.</p>
            <p>Daniel M' Ulphin received them into his Houſe; by him they were treated with great Kindneſs, and the Women continued at his Houſe and worked five Weeks for him.</p>
            <p>Jeſſe Gilbert met with Employ at Thomas Buſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by's, where he lived very agreeably for the Space of nine Months.</p>
            <p>Elizabeth Gilbert had the Satisfaction of an eaſy Employ at Adam Scott's, Merchant, having the Superintendence of his Kitchen, but about ſix Weeks after ſhe engaged in his Service, Jeſſe's Wife Sarah, was taken ſick at Thomas Buſby's, which made it neceſſary for her Mother to diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage herſelf from the Place where ſhe was ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſituated, in Order to nurſe her — Theſe three were favoured to be conſidered as the King's Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, having Rations allowed them; this Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance was very comfortable, but Elizabeth's Name being eraſed out of the Liſt at a Time when they needed an additional Supply, they were much ſtraightned: Upon an Application to one Col. Campbell, he, together with Eſquire Campbell, took down a ſhort Account of her Sufferings and Situation, and after preparing a conciſe Narrative, they applied to the Brigadier General, to forward it to General Haldimand at Quebec, deſiring his Attention to the Sufferers, who ſpeedily iſſued his Orders, that the Releaſement of the Family ſhould be procured, with particular injunctions for every Garriſon to furniſh them with Neceſſaries as they came down.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as Sarah Gilbert recovered from her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, her Mother returned to Adam Scott's Family.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:018497_0034_0FA7A991A39A6528"/>
Thomas Gomerſom hearing of their Situation, came to ſee them; he was educated a Quaker, and had been a Merchant of New-York, and travelled with Robert Walker in his religious Viſits; but upon the Commencement of the War, had devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated from his former Principles, and had loſt all the Appearance of a Friend, wearing a Sword: He behaved with Reſpect to the Priſoners, and made Elizabeth a Preſent.</p>
            <p>The particular Attention of Col. Cloſs, and the Care he ſhewed by writing to Niagara, on Behalf of the Captives, as he was entirely a Stranger to her, is remembered with Gratitude.</p>
            <p>As there was an Opportunity of hearing from Niagara, it gave them great Pleaſure to be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Elizabeth Gilbert was amongſt the white People, ſhe having obtained her Releaſe from the Indians, prior to the others.</p>
            <p>Sarah Gilbert, Wife of Jeſſe, becoming a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Elizabeth left the Service ſhe was engaged in, Jeſſe having taken a Houſe, that ſhe might give her Daughter every neceſſary Attendance; and in Order to make their Situation as comfortable as poſſible, they took a Child to nurſe, which added a little to their Income. After this, Elizabeth Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert hired herſelf to iron a Day for Adam Scott; whilſt ſhe was at her Work, a little Girl belonging to the Houſe, acquainted her that there were ſome who wanted to ſee her, and upon entering into the Room, ſhe found found ſx of her Children; the Joy and Surpriſe ſhe felt on this Occaſion, were beyond what we ſhall attempt to deſcribe. A Meſſenger was ſent to inform Jeſſe and his Wife, that Joſeph Gilbert, Benjamin Peart, Elizabeth his Wife, and young Child, Abner and Elizabeth Gilbert, the younger, were with their Mother. It muſt afford very pleaſing Reflections to any affectionate Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:018497_0035_0FA7A99263F31830"/>
to dwell awhile on this Scene, that after a Captivity of upwards of fourteen Months, ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py a Meeting ſhould take Place.</p>
            <p>Thomas Peart, who had obtained his Liberty, and tarried at Niagara, that he might be of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the two yet remaining in Captivity, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Benjamin Gilbert, jun. and Rebecca Gilbert.</p>
            <p>Abigail Dodſon, the Daughter of a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Farmer, who was taken with them, having inadvertently informed the Indians ſhe was not of the Gilbert Family, all Attempts for her Liberty were fruitleſs.</p>
            <p>We ſhall now proceed to relate how Joſeph Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, the eldeſt Son of the deceaſed, fared amongſt the Indians: He, with Thomas Peart, Benjamin Gilbert, jun. and Jeſſe Gilbert's Wife Sarah, were taken along the Weſtward Path, as before related; after ſome ſhort Continuance in this Path, Thomas Peart and Joſeph Gilbert were taken from the other two, and by a different Rout through many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, they were brought to Caracadera, where they received the Inſults of the Women and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, whoſe Huſbands or Parents had fallen in their hoſtile Excurſions.</p>
            <p>Joſeph Gilbert was ſeparated from his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and removed to an Indian Villa, called Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, about ſeven Miles from Caracadera; his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence was, for ſeveral Weeks, in the King's Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, whoſe Hamlet was ſuperior to the other ſmall Huts. The King himſelf brought him ſome Hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and treated him with great Civility, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Adoption into the Family, in the Place of one of his Sons, who was ſlain when General Sullivan drove them from their Habitations. As Nundow was not to be the Place of his Abode, his Quarters were ſoon changed, and he was taken back to Caracadera; but his Weakneſs of Body
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:018497_0036_0FA7A99328292890"/>
was ſo great, that he was two Days accompliſhing this Journey, which was only ſeven Miles, and not able to procure any other Food than Roots and Herbs, the Indian Oeconomy leaving them without any Proviſions to ſubſiſt on. Here they adopted him into the Family of one of the King's Sons, informing him, that if he would marry amongſt them, he ſhould enjoy the Privileges which they enjoyed; but this Propoſal he was not diſpoſed to comply with, and as he was not over anxious to conceal his Diſlike to them, the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings he underwent were not alleviated. The Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his Life differing ſo much from what he had before been accuſtomed to, having to eat the wild Roots and Herbs before mentioned, and as he had been lame from a Child, and ſubject to frequent Indiſpoſitions, it was requiſite for him to pay more Attention to his weak Habit of Body, than his Captors were willing he ſhould. When the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Family was at Home, the Reſpect he ſhewed to Joſeph, and his Kindneſs to him, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his Situation more tolerable than in his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. Frequnently ſuffering with Hunger, the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of a plenteous Table, appeared to him as an ineſtimable Bleſſing, which claimed the warmeſt Devotion of Gratitude: In ſuch a diſtreſſed Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Hours rolled over with a Tediouſneſs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inſupportable, as he had no agreeable Employ to relieve his Mind from the Reflections of his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful Captivity: This Manner of Life continued about three Months, and when they could not long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er procure a Supply by their hunting, Neceſſity compelled them to go to Niagara Fort for Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The greater Number of the Indians belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Caracadera attended on this Journey, in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to obtain a Supply of Proviſions; their Want of Oeconomy being ſo great, as to have conſumed
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:018497_0037_0FA7A99E3745AE0"/>
ſo early as the eighth Month, all they had raiſed the laſt Year, and the preſent Crops unfit to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Their profuſe Manner of uſing their ſcant Pittance of Proviſion, generally introducing a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, after a ſhort Time of Feaſting. They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute the Diſtance from Caracadera, to Niagara Fort, to be of 130 Miles; on this Journey they were upwards of five Days, taking ſome Veniſon in their Route, and feaſting with great Greedineſs, as they had been a long Time without Meat.</p>
            <p>When they reached the Fort, they procured Cloathing from the King's Stores for Joſeph Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, ſuch as the Indians uſually wear themſelves, a Match-coat, Leggings, &amp;c. His Indiſpoſition confined him at Col. Johnſon's for ſeveral Days, during which Time, the Britiſh Officers endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to agree with the Indians for his Releaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but they would not conſent. The aſſlicting Account of the Death of his Father, which was here communicated to him, ſpre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d an additional Gloom on his Mind. After continuing at the Fort about four Weeks, the Indians ordered him back with them; this was a sore Stroke, to leave a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Eaſe and Plenty, and reſume the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips of an Indian Life: With this uncomfortable Proſpect before him, added to his Lameneſs, the Journey was toilſome and painful. They were five Days in their Return, and when they arrived, their Corn was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ipe for Uſe; this, with the Advantage of hunting, as the Game was in its greateſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, furniſhed a preſent comfortable Subſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>Joſeph had Permiſſion to viſit his fellow Captive, Thomas Peart, who was at a ſmall Town of the Indians, about ſeven Miles Diſtance, called <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, to whom he communicated the ſorrowful
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:018497_0038_0FA7A99544B9ABC8"/>
Intelligence of their Mother's widowed Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>At the firſt Approach of Spring, Joſeph Gilbert and his adopted Brother employed themſelves in procuring Rails, and reparing the Fence about the Lot of Ground they intended to plant with Corn; as this Part of preſerving the Grain was allotted to them, the planting and Culture was aſſigned to the Women, their Huſbandry being altogether per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Hoe.</p>
            <p>The Indian Manner of Life was by no Means agreeable to Joſeph Gilbert; their Irregularity in their Meals was hard for him to bear; when they had proviſions in Plenty, they obſerved no Plan of domeſtic Oeconomy, but indulged their voracious Appetites, which ſoon conſumed their Stock, and a Famine ſucceeded.</p>
            <p>In the early Part of the ſixth Month, 1781, their Corn was ſpent, and they were obliged to have Recourſe again to the wild Herbage and Roots, and were ſo reduced for Want of Proviſion, that the Indians having found the Carcaſe of a dead Horſe, they took the Meat and roaſted it.</p>
            <p>An Officer from the Fort came down to enquire into the Situation of the Indians, upon obſerving the low Condition Joſeph was in, not being likely to continue long without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ome Relief, which the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer privately afforded, he being permitted to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent his Houſe, he adviſed him by Flight, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour an eſcape from the Indians, informing him that he had no other Expedient for his Releaſe; this confirmed him in a Reſolution he had for ſome time been contemplating, but his Lameneſs and weak Habit, for Want of proper Suſtenance, rendered it impracticable to make ſuch an Attempt at that Time, and it would require much Care and Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his own Health and Strength, to gather ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:018497_0039_0FA7A997AF52A3A8"/>
for ſuch an Undertaking; he therefore made Uſe of the Liberty allowed him to viſit the Officer, and partake of his Kindneſs and Aſſiſtance, that he might be prepared for the Journey.</p>
            <p>Embracing a favourable Opportunity, when the Men were generally from Home, ſome in their War Expeditions, and ſome out hunting, he left them one Night whilſt the Family ſlept, and made the beſt of his Way towards Niagara Fort, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Path, as he had once before gone along it. Having a ſmall Piece of Bread which he took from the Hut, he made a haſty Repaſt, travelling Day and Night, in Order to eſcape from the further Diſtreſſes of Captivity. As he neither took any Sleep, or other Food by the Way than the Piece of Bread mentioned, for the two Days and Nights he purſued his Journey, he was much fatigued when he reached the Fort, and he experienced the Effects for ſeveral Days. Upon his applying to Col. Johnſon, he was hoſpitably entertained, and the next Day ſaw three of the Indians whom he had left at the Town when he ſet off.</p>
            <p>After a few Days Stay here, as moſt of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily were diſcharged from Captivity, and waiting for a Paſſage to Montreal, a Veſſel was fitted to take them on Board, in Order to proceed down the Lake.</p>
            <p>We come next to Benjamin Peart, who remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the firſt Night after his arriving at the Indian Huts, with his Wife and Child, but was ſeparated from them the next Day, and taken about a Mile and an Half, and preſented to one of the Families of the Seneca Nation, and afterwards introduced to one of their Chiefs, who made a long Harrangue which Penjamin did not underſtand. The Indians then gave him to a Squaw, in Order to be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as her adopted Child, who ordered him to a
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:018497_0040_0FA7A9986598C180"/>
private Hut, where the Women wept over him in Remembrance of the Relation in whoſe Stead he was received: After this, he went with his Mother (by Adoption) to Niagara River, about two Miles below the great Falls, and ſtaid here ſeveral Days, then went to the Fort on their Way to the Geneſee River, where he had the Pleaſure of converſing with his Mother, and receiving Information con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Wife and Child; but even this Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction was ſhort lived, for he neither could obtain Permiſſion to viſit his Wife, nor was he allowed to converſe freely with his Mother, as the Indians hurried him on board their Bark Canoes, where having placed their Proviſions, they proceeded with Expedition down the Lake to the Mouth of the Geneſee River; the computed Diſtance from the ſmall Village to the Mouth of the River, being one Hundred Miles, and from thence up the Geneſee to the Place of their Deſtination, thirty Miles; in their Paſſage up the River they were about five Days, and as the Falls in this River near its Entrance into Lake Ontario, has made a Carrying place of about two Miles, they dragged their Canoe this Diſtance to the Place of Boating above the Falls. There were nine Indians of the Party with them. They frequently caught Fiſh by the Way.</p>
            <p>It no Doubt was a ſore Affliction to Benjamin, to be ſo far removed from his Wife and Child whilſt amongſt the Indians: Patience and Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alone could endure it.</p>
            <p>When the Party arrived at the Place of their deſigned Settlement, they ſoon erected a ſmall Hut or Wigwam, and the Ground being rich and level, they began with their Plantation of Indian Corn. Two white Men who had been taken Priſoners, the one from Suſquehanna, the other from Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinks, both in Pennſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="42" facs="unknown:018497_0041_0FA7A99929487758"/>
Settlement, and were allowed by the Indians to uſe the Horſes and plant for themſelves: Theſe Men lightened the Toil of Benjamin Peart's Servitude, as he was frequently in their Company, and he had the Liberty of doing ſomething for himſelf, tho' without much Succeſs.</p>
            <p>His new Habitation, as it was not very healthy, introduced freſh Difficulties, for he had not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued here long, before he was afflicted with Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which preyed upon him near three Months, the Indians repeatedly endeavouring to relieve him by their Knowledge in Simples, but their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours proved ineffectual; the Approach of the Winter Seaſon afforded the Relief ſought for. Their Proviſion was not very tempting to a weakly Conſtitution, having nothing elſe than Hommony, and but ſhort Allowance even of that, inſomuch that when his Appetite increaſed, he could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure Food ſufficient to recruit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is Strength. The Company of his Brother Thomas Peart who vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited him, was a great Comfort, and as the Town he lived at was but the Diſtance of eighteen Miles, they had frequent Opportunities of condoling with each other in their Diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>The Indian Men being abſent on one of their War Excurſions, and the Women employed in ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering the Corn, left Benjamin Peart much Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to reflect in Solitude.</p>
            <p>Towards the Beginning of the Winter Seaſon the Men returned, and built themſelves a Log Houſe for a Granary, and then removed about twenty Miles from their Settlement into the hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Country, and procured a great Variety of Game, which they uſually eat with<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Bread or Salt. As he had been with the Indians for ſeveral Months, their Language became more familiar to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:018497_0042_0FA7A999E4AF1530"/>
Hunting and feaſting after their Manner being their only Employ, they ſoon cleared the Place where they ſettled of the Game, which made a ſecond Removal neceſſary, and they are ſo accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to this wandering Life, that it becomes their Choice.</p>
            <p>They fixed up a Log Hut in this ſecond Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, and continued until the ſecond Month, when they returned to their firſt Settlement, tho' their Stay was but a few Days, and then back again to their Log Hut.</p>
            <p>A heavy Rain falling melted ſome of the Snow which had covered the Ground about two Feet deep.</p>
            <p>The whole Family concluded upon a Journey to Niagara Fort by Land, which was compleated in ſeven Days. At the Fort he had the Satisfaction of converſing with his Brother Thomas Peart and the same Day his wife alſo came from Buffaloe Creek, with the Senecas to the Fort<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; this happy Meeting, after an Abſence of ten Months, drew Tears of Joy from them. He made an Inquiry after his Child, as he had neither heard from it or the Mother ſince their Separation. The Indians not approving of their converſing much together, as they imagined they would remember their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Situation, and become leſs contented with their preſent Manner of Life, they ſeparated them again the ſame Day, and took Benjamin's Wife about four Miles Diſtance; but the Party with whom he came, permitted him to ſtay here ſeveral Nights, and when the Indians had compleated their Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Traffic they returned, taking him ſome Miles back with them to one of their Towns; but upon his telling them he was deſirous of returning to the Fort to procure ſomething he had before forgot, in Order for his Journey, he was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. As he ſtaid the Night, his adopted Brother
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:018497_0043_0FA7A99AA5E78590"/>
the Indian came for him, but upon his complaining that he was ſo lame as to prevent his travelling with them, they ſuffered him to remain behind.</p>
            <p>He continued at the Fort about two Months be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Indians came back again, and as he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured for the white People, he had an Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of procuring ſalt Proviſion from the King's Stores, which had been for a long Time a Dainty to him.</p>
            <p>When one of the Indians (a ſecond adopted Brother) came for him, Benjamin went with him to Capt. Powel, who with earneſt Solicitations and ſome Preſents prevailed upon the Indian to ſuffer him to ſtay until he returned from his War Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; but this was the laſt he ever made, as he loſt his Life on the Frontiers of New-York.</p>
            <p>After this another Captain (a third adopted Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) came to the Fort, and when Benjamin Peart ſaw him, he applied to Adjutant General Wilkin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to intercede for his Releaſe, who accordingly waited upon Col. Johnſon and other Officers, to prevail with them to exert themſelves on his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half; they concluded to hold a Council with the Indians for this Purpoſe, who after ſome Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſurrendered him up to Col. Johnſon, for which he gave them a valuable Compenſation.</p>
            <p>Benjamin Peart after his Releaſe was employed in Col Johnſon's Service, and continued with him for ſeveral Months. His Child had been releaſed for ſome Time, and his Wife by earneſt Entreaty and Plea of Sickneſs, had prevailed with the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to permit her Stay at the Fort, which proved a great Conſolation and Comfort after ſo long a Separation.</p>
            <p>About the Middle of the eighth Month, there was Preparation made for their Proceeding to Montreal, as by this Time there were ſix of the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:018497_0044_0FA7A99B649B2B88"/>
Priſoners ready to go in a Ship which lay in Lake Ontario, whoſe Names were Joſeph Gilbert, Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin Peart, his Wife and Child, Abner Gilbert, and Elizabeth Gilbert the younger: Theſe went on Board the Veſſel to Charlton Iſland, which is as far as the large Veſſels they uſe in the Lake can proceed; the Remainder of the Way (on Account of the frequent Shoals) they are obliged to go in ſmaller Boats.</p>
            <p>The commanding Officer at Niagara procured a ſuitable Supply of Proviſion, and furniſhed them with Orders to draw more at the ſeveral Garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as Occaſion required.</p>
            <p>In two Days they arrived at the upper End of Charlton Iſland, and went to the Commander in Chief to ſhew their Paſs, and obtain what they were in Need of. Afterwards they continued on to the Garriſon of Oſwagotchy by the Side of the River St. Laurence, in an open Boat rowed by four Frenchmen, this Claſs of People being chiefly employed in laborious Services.</p>
            <p>The Stream was ſo rapid and full of Rocks, that the Priſoners were too much alarmed to remain in the Boat, and concluded to go on Shore until they paſſed the Danger; but the Frenchmen, who had been accuſtomed to theſe wild and violent Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pids, (the longeſt of which is known by the Name of the long Sou) kept on Board: This ſurpriſing Scene continued for the Diſtance of ſix Miles, and they viewed it with a Degree of Horror, their Heads becoming almoſt giddy with the Proſpect. When the Boats had ſhot the Falls, they again went on Board and continued down the River to Cour de Lac. No great Diſtance below this they anchored, and landed at the Place where their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was interred, ſhedding many Tears of filial Affection to his Memory. They afterwards appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:018497_0045_0FA7A99C2454B090"/>
to the commanding Officer of the Garriſon for Proviſions and other Neceſſaries; they then bid Adieu to this ſolemn Spot of Sorrow, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to Laſheen, which they reached the twenty-fourth Day of the eighth Month, having been eight Days on their Voyage.</p>
            <p>After refreſhing themſelves at this Garriſon, they ſet forward on Foot for Montreal, which they reached the ſame Day. They went to the Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier General and ſhewed him their Paſſport, and as ſoon as at Liberty waited on their Mother at Adam Scott's, as has been already related.</p>
            <p>The Situation of Elizabeth Peart Wife of Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin, and her Child is next to be related;</p>
            <p>After ſhe and the Child were parted from her Huſband, Abigail Dodſon and the Child were taken ſeveral Miles in the Night to a little Hut, where they ſtaid till Morning, and the day following were taken within 8 Miles of Niagara, where ſhe was adopted into one of the Families of Senecas; the Ceremony of Adoption to her was tedious and diſtreſſing; they obliged her to ſit down with a young Man an Indian, and the eldeſt Chi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſtain of the Family repeating a Jargon of Words to her unintelligible, but which ſhe conſidered as ſome form amongſt them of Marriage, and this Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion introduced the moſt violent agitations, as ſhe was determined, at all events, to oppoſe any ſtep of this Nature; but after the old Indian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded his Speech ſhe was relieved from the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Embarraſſment ſhe had been under, as ſhe was led away by another Indian.</p>
            <p>Abigail Dodſon was given the ſame day to one of the Families of the Cayuga Nation, ſo that Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Peart ſaw her no more.</p>
            <p>The Man who led Elizabeth from the Company took her into the Family for whom they adopted
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:018497_0046_0FA7A99CE6727FB0"/>
her, and introduced her to her Parents, Brothers and Siſters in the Indian ſtile, who received her very kindly, and made a grievous Lamentation very kindly, and made a grievous Lamentation over her according to Cuſtom. After ſhe had been with them two Days, the whole Family left their Habitation and went about two Miles to Fort Sluſher, where they ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d ſeveral Days: This Fort is about one Mile above Niagara Falls.</p>
            <p>As ſhe was much indiſpoſed, the Indians were detained ſeveral Days for her; but as they cared little for her, ſhe was obliged to lie on the damp Ground, which prevented her ſpeedy Recovery. As ſoon as her Diſorder abated of its Violence, they ſet off in a Bark Canoe which they had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, intending for Buffaloe Creek; and as they went ſlowly, they had an Opportunity of taking ſome Fiſh.</p>
            <p>When they arrived at the Place of their intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Settlement, they went on Shore and built an Houſe.</p>
            <p>A few Days after they came to this new Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they returned with Elizabeth to Fort Sluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, when ſhe was told her Child muſt be taken away from her; this was truly afflicting, but all Remonſtrances were in vain.</p>
            <p>From Fort Sluſher ſhe travelled on Foot, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Child to Niagara, it being eighteen Miles, and in ſultry Weather, rendered it a painful Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Thoughts of parting with her tender offspring. The Intent of their Journey was to obtain Proviſions, and their Stay at the Fort was of ſeveral Days Continuance. Capt. Powel afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her an Aſylum in his Houſe.</p>
            <p>The Indians took the Child from her, and went with it acroſs the River to adopt it into the Family they had aſſigned for it, notwithſtanding Capt. Powel, at his Wife's Requeſt, interceded that it
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:018497_0047_0FA7A99DA8012E30"/>
might not be removed from its Mother; but as it was ſo young, they returned it to the Mother after its Adoption, until it ſhould be convenient to ſend it to the Family under whoſe Protection it was to be placed.</p>
            <p>Obtaining the Proviſion and other Neceſſaries they came to Niagara to trade for, they returned to Fort Sluſher on Foot, from whence they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked in their Canoes. It being near the Time of planting, they uſed much Expedition in this Journey.</p>
            <p>The Labour and Drudgery in a Family falling to the Share of the Women, Elizabeth had to aſſiſt the Squaw in preparing the Ground and planting Corn.</p>
            <p>Their Proviſion being ſcant they ſuffered much, and as their Dependence for a ſufficient Supply un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the gathering their Crop, was on what they ſhould receive from the Fort, they were under the Neceſſity of making a ſecond Journey thither.</p>
            <p>They were two Days on the Road at this Time. A ſmall Diſtance before they came to the Fort, they took her Child from her, and ſent it to its deſtined Family, and it was ſeveral Months before ſhe had an Opportunity of ſeeing it again. After being taken from her Huſband, to loſe her darling Infant, was a ſevere Stroke: She lamented her Condition and wept ſorely, for which one of the Indians inhumanly ſtruck her. Her Indian Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeemed a little moved to behold her ſo diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and in Order to conſole her, aſſured her they would bring it back again, but ſhe ſaw it not until the Spring following.</p>
            <p>After they had diſpoſed of their Peltries, they returned to their Habitation by the ſame Route which they had come.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:018497_0048_0FA7A99E700EEAE0"/>
With a Heart oppreſſed with Sorrow, Elizabeth trod back her Steps, mourning for her loſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, for this Idea preſented itſelf continually to her Mind; but as ſhe experienced how fruitleſs, nay how dangerous, Solicitations in Behalf of her Child were, ſhe dried up her Tears and pined in Secret.</p>
            <p>Soon after they reached their own Habitation, Elizabeth Peart was again afflicted with Sickneſs. At the firſt they ſhewed ſome Attention to her Complaints; but as ſhe did not ſpeedily recover ſo as to be able to work, they diſcontinued every At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and built a ſmall Hut by the Side of the Corn-field, placing her in it to mind the Corn. In this lonely Condition ſhe ſaw a white Man, who had been made Priſoner among the Indians: He informed her that her Child was releaſed and with the white People; this Information revived her drooping Spirits, and a ſhort Time after ſhe reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of her Indiſpoſition, but her Employment ſtill continued of attending the Corn until it was ripe for gathering, which ſhe aſſiſted in. When the Harveſt was over, they permitted her to return and live with them.</p>
            <p>A Time of Plenty commenced, and they lived as if they had Sufficient to laſt the Year through, faring plentiouſly every Day.</p>
            <p>A drunken Indian came to the Cabbin one Day, and the old Indian Woman complaining to him of Elizabeth, his Behaviour exceedingly terrified her; he ſtormed like a Fury, and at Length ſtruck her a violent Blow which laid her on the Ground; he then began to pull her about and abuſe her much, when another of the Women in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

it totally deprives them both of Senſe and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
            <p>A <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>edious Winter prevented them from leaving their Habitation, and deprived her of the Pleaſure of hearing often from her Friends, who were very much ſcattered; but a Priſoner, who had lately ſeen her Huſband, informed her of his being much indiſpoſed at the Geneſee River, which was upwards of one Hundred Miles Diſtance: receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Intelligence, ſhe ſtood in Need of much Conſolation, but had no Source of Comfort, except in her own Boſom.</p>
            <p>Near the Return of Spring their Proviſion fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they were compelled to go off to the Fort for a freſh Supply, having but a ſmall Portion of Corn which they allowanced out once each Day.</p>
            <p>Through Snow and ſevere Froſt they went for Niagara, ſuffering much from the exceſſive Cold. And when they came within a few Miles of the Fort, which they were four Days accompliſhing, they ſtruck up a ſmall Wigwam for ſome of the Family with the Priſoners to live in, until the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the Warriors from the Fort.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as Capt. Powell's Wife heard that the young Child's Mother had come with the Indians, ſhe deſired to ſee her, claiming ſome Relationſhip in the Indian Way, as ſhe had alſo been a Priſoner amongſt them. They granted her Requeſt, and Elizabeth was accordingly introduced, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that her Huſband was returned to the Fort, and there was ſome Expectations of his Releaſe. The ſame Day Benjamin Peart came to ſee his Wife, but could not be permitted to continue with her, as the Indians inſiſted on her going back with them to their Cabbin, which, as has been related, was ſome Miles diſtant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:018497_0050_0FA7A9A1CB08CC70"/>
Elizabeth Peart was not allowed for ſome Days to go from the Cabbin, but a white Family who had bought her Child from the Indians to whom it had been preſented, offered the Party with whom Elizabeth was confined a Bottle of Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> if they would bring her acroſs the River to her Child, which they did and delighted the Fond Mother with this happy Meeting, as ſhe had not ſeen it for the Space of eight Months.</p>
            <p>She was permitted to ſtay with the Family where her Child was for two Days, when ſhe returned with the Indians to their Cabbin. After ſome time ſhe obtained a further Permiſſion to go to the Fort, where ſhe had ſome Needle work from the white People, which afforded her a Plea for often Viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. At length Capt. Powell's Wiſe prevailed with them to ſuffer her to continue a few Days at her Houſe, and work for her Family, which was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. At the Expiration of the time, upon the coming of the Indians for her to return with them, ſhe pleaded Indiſpoſition, and by this means they were repeatedly diſſuaded from taking her with them.</p>
            <p>As the time of Planting drew nigh, ſhe made uſe of a little Addreſs to retard her Departure; having a ſmall Swelling on her N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ck ſhe applied a Poultice, which led the Indians into a Belief it was improper to remove her, and they conſented to come again for her in two Weeks.</p>
            <p>Her Child was given up to her ſoon after her Arrival at the Fort, where ſhe lodged at Capt. Powell's, and her Huſband come frequently to viſit her, which was a great happineſs, as her Trials in their Separation had been many.</p>
            <p>At the Time appointed ſome of the Indians came again, but ſhe ſtill pled Indiſpoſition, and had conſined herſelf to her Bed. One of the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:018497_0051_0FA7A9A225D0BD88"/>
Women interrogated her very cloſely, but did not inſiſt upon her going Back. Thus ſeveral Months elapſed, ſhe contriving Delays as often as they came</p>
            <p>When the Veſſel which was to take the other five, among whom were her Huſband and Child, was ready to ſail, the Officers at Niagara conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe might alſo go with them, as they ſaw no reaſonable Objection, and they doubted not but it was in their Power to ſatisfy thoſe Indians who conſidered her as their Property.</p>
            <p>Abner Gilbert, another of the Captives, when the Company had reached the Indian town within three miles of Niagara Fort, was, with Elizabeth Gilbert the Younger, ſeparated from the reſt, about the latter part of the fifth Month 1780, and were both adopted into John Huſton's Family, who was of the Cayuga Nation. After a Stay of three Days at or near the Settlement of theſe Indians, they removed to a Place near the Great Falls, which is about eighteen Miles diſtant from the Fort, and loitered here three Days more; they then croſſed the River and ſettled near its Banks, clearing a Piece of Land and prepared it by the Hoe for Plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Until they could gather their Corn their Dependance was entirely upon the Fort.</p>
            <p>After the ſpace of three Weeks they packed up their Moveables, which they generally carry with them in their Rambles, and went down the River to get Proviſions at Butlerſbury, a ſmall Village built by Col Butler and is on the oppoſite Side of the River to Niagara Fort. They ſtaid one Night at the Village, obſerving great Caution that none of the White People ſhould converſe with the Priſoners. Next Day, after tranſacting their Buſineſs, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their Settlement, and continued there but about one Week, when it was concluded they
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:018497_0052_0FA7A9A2E5F0C0D8"/>
muſt go again for Butlerſbury; after they had left their Habitation a ſmall diſtance the Head of the Family met with his Brother, and as they are very ceremonious in ſuch Interviews, the Place of Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was their Rendezvous for the Day and Night. In the morning the Family, with the Brother before mentioned, proceeded for Butlerſbury, and reached it before Night. They went to the Houſe of an Engliſhman, one John Seecord, who was ſtiled Brother to the Chief of the Family, having lived with him ſome time before.</p>
            <p>After ſome Deliberation it was agreed that Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Gilbert ſhould continue in this Family till ſent for; this was an agreeable Change to her.</p>
            <p>Abner returned with them to the Settlement; his Employ being to fence and ſecure the Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch; ſometimes he had plenty of Proviſions but was often in want.</p>
            <p>The Miſtreſs of the Family one Day intending for Butlerſbury, ordered Abner to prepare to go with her; but ſhe had not gone far before ſhe ſent him back. Notwithſtanding he had long been inured to frequent Diſappointments, he was much morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at returning, as he expected to have ſeen his Siſter. When the Woman came Home ſhe gave him no Information about her, and all Inquiries on his Part would have been fruitleſs.</p>
            <p>The Place they had ſettled at ſerved for a Dwelling until Fall, and as it was not very far Diſtant from the Fort, by often applying for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, they were not ſo much diſtreſſed between the failing of their old Crop and the gathering of the new one, as thoſe who lived at a greater Diſtance.</p>
            <p>In the Fall John Huſton, the Head of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, went out hunting, and in his Return caught Cold from his careleſs Manner of lying in the Wet, and thereby loſt the Uſe of his Limbs for a long

Time. On being informed of his Situation, the Family moved to the Place where he was; they fixed a Shelter over him (as he was unable to move himſelf) and continued here about a Month; but as it was remote from any Settlement, and they had to go often to the Fort for the Neceſſaries of Life, the concluded to return to their own Habitation. Abner, one Indian Man, and ſome of the Women carried the Cripple in a Blanket about two Miles; this was ſo hard a Taſk, they agreed to put up a ſmall Houſe and wait for his Recovery: But not long after they had an Opportunity of conveying him on Horſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> back to the Landing, about nine Miles above the Fort. As this was their Plantation and the Time of gathering their Crops, they took in their Corn, which, as has been before obſerved, is the Buſineſs of the Women. Then they chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Quarters, carrying they lame Indian as before in a Blanket, down to the River Side, when they went on board Canoes, and croſt the River in order to get to their Hunting-Ground, where they uſually ſpend the Winter.</p>
            <p>Abner Gilbert <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ived a droniſh Indian Life, idle and poor, having no other Employ than the gathering of Hickory-Nuts; and although young, his Situation was very irkſome.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Family came to the Hunting-Ground, they patched up a ſlight Hut for their Reſidence, and employed themſelves in hunting. They took Abner along with them in one of their Tours, but they were then unſucceſsful, taking nothing but Rac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="55" facs="unknown:018497_0054_0FA7A9A4651E8870"/>
which continued to be his Employment for the Remainder of the Seaſon.</p>
            <p>In the Spring John Huſton, the Indian who had been lame the whole Winter, recovered, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily had it in his Power to obtain a Supply of Rum, which he frequently drank to Exceſs; and always when thus debauched was extravagantly moroſe, quarreling with the Women who were in the Family, and at L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t them. Soon after his Departure the Family moved about forty Miles, near Buffalo Creek, which empties its Waters into Lake Erie. At this Place Abner heard of his Siſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Rebecca Gilbert, who ſtill remained in Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity not far from his new Habitation. This was their Summer Reſidence, they therefore under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to clear a Piece of Land, in which they put Corn, Pumpkins and Squaſhes.</p>
            <p>Abner, having no uſeful Employ, amuſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with catching Fiſh in the Lake, and furniſhed the Family with frequent Meſſes of various Kinds, which they eat without Bread or Salt; for the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this Settlement from the Fort prevented them from obtaining Proviſions ſo frequently as neceſſary. Capt. John Powell and Thomas Peart (the latter had by this time obtained his Releaſe from the Indians) and ſeveral others came among the Indian Settlements with Proviſion and Hoes for them. The Account of their coming ſoon ſpread amongſt the Indians. The Chiefs of every Tribe came, bringing with them as many little Sticks as there were Perſons in their Tribe, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Number, in Order to obtain a juſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the Proviſion to be diſtributed. They are ſaid to be unacquainted with any other Power of explaining Numbers than by this ſimple hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphic Mode.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:018497_0055_0FA7A9A523759360"/>
It was upwards of a Year ſince Abner had been parted from his Relations, and as he had not ſeen his Brother Thomas Peart in that Space of Time, this un-expected Meeting gave him great Joy, but it was of ſhort Duration, as they were forced to leave him behind. During the Corn Seaſon he was employed in tending it, and not being of an impatient Diſpoſition he bore his Captivity without repining.</p>
            <p>In the ſeventh Month, 1781, the Family went to Butlerſbury, when Col. Butler treated with the Woman who was the Head of this Family for the Releaſe of Abner, which ſhe at Length conſented to, on receiving ſome Preſents, but ſaid he muſt firſt return with her, and ſhe would deliver him up in twenty Days. Upon their Return, ſhe gave Abner the agreeable Information that he was to be given up. This added a Spur to his Induſtry, and made his Labour light.</p>
            <p>Some Days before the Time agreed on, they proceeded for Butlerſbury, and went to John Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord's where his Siſter Elizabeth Gilbert had been from the Time mentioned in the former Part of this Narrative.</p>
            <p>Abner was diſcharged by the Indians ſoon after his Arrival at the Engliſh Village, and John Secord permitted him to live in his Family with his Siſter. With this Family they continued two Weeks, and as they were under the Care of the Engliſh Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, they were permitted to draw Cloathing and Proviſions from the King's Stores.</p>
            <p>Afterwards Benjamin Peart and his Brother Thomas, who were both releaſed, came over for their Brother and Siſter at John Secord's, and went with them to Capt. Powell's in Order to be nearer to the Veſſel they were to go in to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:018497_0056_0FA7A9A5E57D7150"/>
The next of the Family who comes within No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is Elizabeth Gilbert the Siſter. From the Time of her being firſt introduced by the Indian into the Family of John Secord, who was one in whom he placed great Confidence. She was under the Neceſſity of having new Cloaths, as thoſe ſhe had brought from Home were much worn. Her Situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation in the Family where ſhe was placed was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. After a few Days Reſidence with them ſhe diſcovered where the young Child was, that had ſome Time before been taken from its Mother Elizabeth Peart, as before mentioned; and her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, together with John Secord's Wife with whom ſhe lived, and Capt. Fry's Wife went to ſee it, in Order to purchaſe it from the Indian Woman who had it under her Care; but they could not then prevail with her, though ſome Time after Capt. Fry's Wife purchaſed it for thirteen Dollars. Whilſt among the Indians it had been for a long Time indiſpoſed, and in a lingering diſtreſſing Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation; but under its preſent kind Protectreſs, who treated the Child as her own, it ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited.</p>
            <p>Elizabeth Gilbert, jun. lived very agreeably in John Secord's Family rather more than a Year, and became ſo fondly attached to her Benefactors, that ſhe uſually Stiled the Miſtreſs of the Houſe her Mamma. During her Reſidence here, her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abner and Thomas Peart came ſeveral Times to viſit her.</p>
            <p>The afflicting Loſs of her Father, to whom ſhe was affectionately endeared, and the Separation from her Mother, whom ſhe had no Expectation of ſeeing again, was a ſevere Trial, although mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated by the kind Attentions ſhown her by the Family in which ſhe lived.</p>

John Secord having ſome Buſineſs at Niagara, took Betſy with him, where ſhe had the Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſeeing ſix of her Relations who had been Captives, but were moſt of them releaſed: This happy Meeting made the Trip to the Fort a very agreeable one. She ſtaid with them all Night, and then returned.</p>
            <p>Not long after this Viſit, Col. Butler and John Secord ſent for the Indian who claimed Elizabeth as his Property, and when he arrived they made Overtures to purchaſe her, but he declared he would not ſell his own Fleſh and Blood; for thus they ſtyle thoſe whom they have adopted. They then had Recourſe to Preſents, which overcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Scruples, they obtained her Diſcharge; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which ſhe remained two Weeks at Butlerſbury, and then went to her Mother at Montreal.</p>
            <p>Having given a brief Relation of the happy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe and Meeting of ſuch of the Captives as had returned from among the Indians, excepting Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Peart, whoſe Narrative is deferred, as he was exerting his endeavours for the Benefit of his Siſter and Couſin who ſtill remained behind.</p>
            <p>It may not be improper to return to the Mother, who with ſeveral of her Children were at Montreal. The Nurſe-Child which they had taken, as related in the former Part of this Account, dying, was a conſiderable Loſs to them, as they could not, even by their utmoſt Induſtry, gain as much any other Way.</p>
            <p>In the Fall of the Year 1781, Col. Johnſon, Capt. Powell, and ſome other Officers came to Montreal upon Buſineſs, and were ſo kind in their Remembrance of the Family, as to inquire after them, and to make them ſome Preſents, congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulating the Mother on the happy Releaſement of ſo many of her Children. They encouraged her
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:018497_0058_0FA7A9A763F94638"/>
with the Information of their Agreement with the Indians, for the Releaſement of her Daughter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca, expecting that ſhe was by that Time at Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agara; but in this Opinion they were miſtaken, as the Indian Family who adopted her, valued her too high to be eaſily prevailed with, and it was a long Time after this before ſhe was given up.</p>
            <p>Elizabeth Gilbert and her Daughters took in Cloaths to waſh for their Support, and being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious and careful, it afforded them a tolerable Subſiſtence.</p>
            <p>Jeſſe Gilbert obtained Employ in his Trade as a Cooper, which yielded a welcome Addition to their Stock.</p>
            <p>Elizabeth Gilbert ſuffered no Opportunity to paſs her, of inquiring about her Friends and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations in Pennſylvania, and had the Satisfaction of being informed by one who came from the Southward, that Friends of Philadelphia had been very aſſiduous in their Endeavours to gain Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation where their Family was, and had ſent to the different Meetings, deſiring them to inform themſelves of the Situation of the captivated Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and, if in their Power, afford them ſuch Relief as they might need.</p>
            <p>It gave her great Pleaſure to hear of this kind ſympathizing Remembrance of their Friends, and it would have been eſſentially ſerviceable to them, could they have reduced it to a Certainty.</p>

               </gap>eborah Jones, a Daughter of Abraham Wing, a Friend, ſent for Elizabeth Gilbert in order to attend her as a Nurſe; but her Death, which was ſoon after, fruſtrated the Proſpect ſhe had of an agreeable Place, as this Woman was better grounded in Friends Principles than moſt ſhe had met with; which Circumſtance united them in the Ties of a cloſe Friendſhip: And as Elizabeth Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:018497_0059_0FA7A9A824A1C6F0"/>
had received many Civilities and Favours from her, her Death was doubly afflicting to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily.</p>
            <p>A Perſon who came from Crown-Point, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her that Benjamin Gilbert, a Son of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed by his firſt Wife, had come thither in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be of what Service he could to the Family, and had deſired him to make Inquiry where they were, and in what Situation, and ſend him the earlieſt Information poſſible.</p>
            <p>A ſecond agreeable Intelligence ſhe received from Niagara, by a young Woman who came from thence, who informed her that her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Rebecca was given up to the Engliſh, by the Indians. This Information muſt have been very pleaſing, as their Expectations of her Releaſe were but faint; the Indian, with whom ſhe lived, conſidering her as her own Child.</p>
            <p>It was not long after this, that Thomas Peart, Rebecca Gilbert, and their Couſin Benjamin Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert came to Montreal to the reſt of the Family. This Meeting, after ſuch Scenes of Sorrow as they had experienced, was more compleatly happy than can be expreſſed.</p>
            <p>Reflection, if indulged, will ſteadily point out a protecting Arm of Power to have ruled the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Storms which often threatned the Family with Deſtruction on their Paſſage through the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, under the Controul of the fierceſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and preſerved and reſtored them to each other, although ſeparated among different Tribes and Nations: This ſo great a Favour, cannot be conſidered by them but with the warmeſt Emoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Gratitude to the great Author.</p>
            <p>Rebecca Gilbert and Benjamin Gilbert, jun. were ſeparated from their Friends and Connexions at a Place called the Five Mile Meadows, which
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:018497_0060_0FA7A9A8E59C4FA8"/>
was ſaid to be that Diſtance from Niagara. The Seneca King's Daughter, to whom they were allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Diſtribution of the Captives, took them to a ſmall Hut where her Father Siangorochti, his Queen, and the Reſt of the Family were, eleven in Number. Upon the Reception of the Priſoners into the Family, there was much Sorrow and Weeping, as is cuſtomary upon ſuch Occaſions, and the higher in Favour the adopted Priſoners are to be placed, the greater Lamentation is made over them.</p>
            <p>After three Days the Family removed to a Place called the Landing, on the Banks of Niagara Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: Here they continued two Days more, and then two of the Women went with the Captives to Niagara, to procure Cloathing from the King's Stores for them, and permitted them to ride on Horſe-back to Fort Sluſher, which is about eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Miles diſtant from Niagara Fort. On this Journey they had a Sight of the Great Falls of Niagara.</p>
            <p>During a Stay of ſix Days at Fort Sluſher, the Britiſh Officers and others uſed their utmoſt En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to purchaſe them of the Indians; but the Indian King ſaid he would not part with them for one thouſand Dollars.</p>
            <p>The Indians who claimed Elizabeth Peart, came to the Fort with her at this Time, and although ſhe was very weakly and indiſpoſed, it was an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Opportunity to them both of converſing with each other, but they were not allowed to be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently together, leſt they ſhould increaſe each others Diſcontent.</p>
            <p>Rebecca being dreſt in the Indian Manner, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very different from what ſhe had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to: Short Clothes, Leggings, and a gold laced Hat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="unknown:018497_0061_0FA7A9A9A408AF88"/>
From Niagara Fort they went about eighteen Miles above the Falls to Fort Erie, a Garriſon of the Engliſh, and then continued their Journey about four Miles further, up Buffalo Creek, and pitched their Tent. At this Place they met with Rebecca's Father and Mother by Adoption, who had gone before on Horſe-back. They caught ſome Fiſh and made Soup of them, but Rebecca could eat none of it, as it was dreſſed without Salt, and with all the Careleſſneſs of Indians.</p>
            <p>This Spot was intended for their Plantation, they therefore began to clear the Land for the Crop of Indian Corn. While the Women were thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, the Men built a Log Houſe for their Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and then went out hunting.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding the Family they lived with, was of the firſt Rank among the Indians, and the Head of it ſtyled King, they were under the Neceſſity of labouring as well as thoſe of lower Rank, although they often had Advantages of procuring more Proviſions than the Reſt. This Family raiſed this Summer about one Hundred Skipple of Indian Corn (a Skipple is about three Pecks) equal to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty-five Buſhels.</p>
            <p>As Rebecca was not able to purſue a Courſe of equal Labour with the other Women, ſhe was favoured by them by often being ſent into their Hut to prepare ſomething to ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and as ſhe dreſt their Proviſions after the Engliſh Method, and had erected an Oven by the Aſſiſtance of the other Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in which they baked their Bread, their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily fared more agreeably than the others.</p>
            <p>Benjamin Gilbert, jun. was conſidered as the King's Succeſſor, and entirely freed from Reſtraint, ſo that he even began to be delighted with his Manner of Life; and had it not been for the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:018497_0062_0FA7A9AB92D263D0"/>
Counſel of his Fellow-Captive, he would not have been anxious for a Change.</p>
            <p>In the Waters of the Lakes there are various Kinds of Fiſh, which the Indians take ſometimes with Spears; but whenever they can obtain Hooks and Lines they prefer them.</p>
            <p>A Fiſh called Ozoondah, reſembling a Shad in Shape, but rather thicker and le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s bony, with which Lake Erie abounded, were often dreſſed for their Table, and were of an agreeable Taſte, weighing from three to four Pounds.</p>
            <p>They drew Proviſions this Summer from the Forts, which frequently induced the Indians to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair thither. The King, his Daughter, Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daughter, and Rebecca went together upon one of theſe Viſits to Fort Erie, where the Britiſh Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers entertained them with a rich Feaſt, and ſo great a Profuſion of Wine, that the Indian King was very drunk; and as he had to manage the Canoe in their Return, they were repeatedly in Danger of being overſet amongſt the Rocks in the Lake.</p>
            <p>Rebecca and Benjamin met with much better Fare than the other Captives, as the Family they lived with were but ſeldom in great Want of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, which was the only Advantage they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed beyond the Reſt of their Tribe.</p>
            <p>Benjamin Gilbert, as a Badge of his Dignity, wore a Silver Medal pendant from his Neck.</p>
            <p>The King, Queen, and another of the Family, together with Rebecca and her Couſin Benjamin ſet off for Niagara, going as far as Fort Sluſher by Water, from whence they proceeded on Foot car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying their Loads on their Backs. Their Buſineſs at the Fort was to obtain Proviſions, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned them frequently to viſit it, as before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:018497_0063_0FA7A9AC628F0008"/>
Rebecca indulged herſelf with the pleaſing Epec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of obtaining her Releaſe, or at leaſt Permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to remain behind among the Whites; but in both theſe Expectations ſhe was diſagreeably diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed having to return again with her Captors; all Efforts for her Releaſe being in Vain. Col. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Houſekeeper, whoſe repeated Acts of Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to this captived Family have been noticed, made her ſome acceptable Preſents.</p>
            <p>As they had procured ſome Rum to carry Home with them, the Chief was frequently intoxicated, and always in ſuch unhappy Fits behaved remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably Fooliſh.</p>
            <p>On their Return, Thomas Peart, who was at Fort Niagara, procured for Rebecca an Horſe to carry her as far as Fort Sluſher, where they took Boat and got Home after a Stay of nine Days.</p>
            <p>Soon after their Return, Rebecca and her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin were ſeized with the Chill and Fever, which held them for near three Months. During their Indiſpoſition the Indians were very kind to them; and as their Strength of Conſtitution alone, could not check the Progreſs of the Diſorder, the Indians procured ſome Herbs, with which the Patients were unacquainted, and made a plentiful Decoction; with theſe they waſhed them, and it ſeemed to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them ſome Relief: The Indians accounted it a ſovereign Remedy.</p>
            <p>The Deceaſe of her Father, of which Rebecca received an Account, continued her in a drooping Way a conſiderable Time longer than ſhe would otherwiſe have been.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as ſhe recovered her Health, ſome of the Family again went to Niagara, and Rebecca was permitted to be of the Company. They ſtaid at the Fort about two Weeks, and Col. Johnſon exerted himſelf in order to obtain her Releaſe,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:018497_0064_0FA7A9ACA50320D0"/>
holding a Treaty with the Indians for this Purpoſe; but his Mediation proved fruitleſs: She had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to return with many an heavy Step. When they came to Lake Erie, where their Canoe was, they proceeded by Water. While in their Boat a Number of Indians in another Canoe came to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and informed them of the Death of her Indian Father, who had made an Expedition to the Frontiers of Pennſylvania, and was there wounded by the Militia, and afterwards died of his Wounds; on which Occaſion ſhe was under the Neceſſity of making a Feint of Sorrow, and weeping aloud with the reſt.</p>
            <p>When they arrived at their Settlement, it was the Time of gathering their Crop of Corn, Pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes, Pumkins, and preſerving their Store of Hickory Nuts.</p>
            <p>About the Beginning of the Winter ſome Britiſh Officers came amongſt them, and ſtaid with them until Spring, uſing every Endeavour for the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the two Captives, but ſtill unattended with Succeſs.</p>
            <p>Some Time after this, another Britiſh Officer, attended by Thomas Peart, came with Proviſion and Hoes for the Indians. It afforded them great Happineſs to enjoy the Satisfaction of each others Converſation, after ſo long an Abſence.</p>
            <p>Rebecca and her Couſin had the additional Pleaſure of ſeeing her Brother Abner, who came with the Family amongſt whom he lived, to ſettle near this Place; and as they had not ſeen each other for almoſt twelve Months, it proved very agreeable.</p>
            <p>Thomas Peart endeavoured to animate his Siſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by encourageing her with the Hopes of ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily obtaining her Liberty: But her Hopes were often diſappointed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:018497_0065_0FA7A9AD64E49098"/>
An Officer amongſt the Britiſh, one Capt. Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teridge, came and ſtaid ſome Time with them, and intereſted himſelf on Behalf of the Priſoners, and appeared in a fair Way of obtaining their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement; but being ordered to join his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was prevented from further Attention until his Return from Duty; and afterwards was commanded by Col. Johnſon to go with him to Montreal, on Buſineſs of Importance, which ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually barred his undertaking any Thing further that Winter.</p>
            <p>It afforded her many pleaſing Reflections when ſhe heard that ſix of her Relatives were freed from their Difficulties, and Thomas Peart viſiting her again, contributed, in ſome Meaſure, to reania<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate her with freſh Hopes of obtaining her own Freedom. They fixed upon a Scheme of carrying her off privately; but when they gave Time for a full Reflection, it was evidently attended with too great Danger, as it would undoubtedly have much enraged the Indians, and perhaps the Lives of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one concerned would have been forfeited by ſuch Indiſcretion.</p>
            <p>During the Courſe of this Winter ſhe ſuffered many Hardſhips and ſevere Diſappointments, and being without a Friend to unboſom her Sorrows to, they appeared to increaſe by Concealment; but making a Virtue of Neceſſity, ſhe ſummoned up a Firmneſs of Reſolution, and was ſupported un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her Diſcouragement beyond her own Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>The Youth and Inexperience of her Couſin did not allow of a ſufficient Confidence in him, but ſhe had often to intereſt herſelf in an Attention to, and Overſight of, his Conduct; and it was in ſome Meaſure owing to this Care, that he retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Deſires to return amongſt his Friends.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:018497_0066_0FA7A9AE269BC618"/>
Col. Butler ſent a String of Wampum to the Indian Chief, who immediately called a Number of the other Indians together upon this Occaſion, when they concluded to go down to Niagara, where they underſtood the Deſign of the Treaty was for the Freedom of the Remainder of the Priſoners; for eſpecial Orders were iſſued by Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Haldimand, at Quebec, that their Liberty ſhould be obtained. At this Council Fire it was agreed they would ſurrender up the Priſoners.</p>
            <p>When they returned they informed Rebecca that Col. Butler had a Deſire to ſee her, which was the only Information ſhe could gain: This being a frequent Cuſtom amongſt them to offer a very ſlight Surmiſe of their Intentions.</p>
            <p>After this the whole Family moved about ſix Miles up Lake Erie, where they ſtaid about two Months to gather their annual Store of Maple Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, of which they made a conſiderable Quantity.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Seaſon for this Buſineſs was over, they returned to their old Settlement, where they had not continued long, before an Indian came with an Account that an aſtoniſhing Number of young Pigeons might be procured at a certain Place, by falling Trees that were filled with Neſts of young, and the Diſtance was computed to be about fifty Miles: This Information delighted the ſeveral Tribes; they ſpeedily joined together, young and old, from different Parts, and with great Aſſiduity purſued their Expedition, and took Abundance of the young ones, which they dried in the Sun and with Smoke, and filled ſeveral Bags which they had taken with them for this Purpoſe, Benjamin Gilbert was permitted to accompany them in this Excurſion, which muſt have been a curious one for whole Tribes to be engaged in.
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:018497_0067_0FA7A9AEE4EEA2B8"/>
On this Rarity they lived with Extravagance for ſome Time, faring ſumptuouſly every Day.</p>
            <p>As the Time approached, when, according to Appointment, they were to return to Niagara and deliver up the Priſoners, they gave Rebecca the agreeable Information, in order to allow her ſome Time to make Preparation. She made them Bread for their Journey with great Cheerfulneſs.</p>
            <p>The Indians, to the Number of thirty, attended on this Occaſion with the two Captives. They went as far as Fort Sluſher in a Bark Canoe. It was ſeveral Days before they reached Niagara Fort, as they went ſlowly on Foot. After attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Col. Butler's, and confering upon this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, in Conſideration of ſome valuable Preſents made them, they releaſed the two laſt of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives Rebecca Gilbert, and Benjamin Gilbert, jun.</p>
            <p>As ſpeedily as they were enabled, their Indian Dreſs was exchanged for the more cuſtomary and agreeable one of the Europeans; and on the third of the ſixth Month, 1782, two Days after their happy Releaſe, ſailed for Montreal.</p>
            <p>The Narrative of the Treatment of Thomas Peart, another of the Family, ſtill remains to be given:</p>
            <p>He was taken along the Weſtward Path with the Priſoners before mentioned, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Joſeph, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, and Benjamin Gilbert jun.</p>
            <p>Thomas was compelled to carry a heavy Load of the Plunder which the Indians had ſeized at their Farm. When ſeparated from the reſt, they were aſſured they ſhould meet together again in four Days.</p>
            <p>The firſt Day's Travel was in an exceeding diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable Path, acroſs ſeveral deep Brooks, through which Thomas had to carry Sarah and Benjamin Gilbert, jun. This Taſk was a very hard one, as
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:018497_0068_0FA7A9AFA5269AD8"/>
he had been much reduced for Want of ſufficient Nouriſhment.</p>
            <p>The firſt Night they lodged by the Banks of Cayuga Creek, the Captives being tied as uſual. The next Morning they took a Veniſon, and this, with ſome decayed Corn which they gathered from the deſerted Fields, ſerved them for Suſtenance. This Day's Journey was by the Side of Cayuga Creek, until they came to a ſteep Hill, which they aſcended with Difficulty.</p>
            <p>When Night came on, they ſought a Wigwam which had been deſerted precipitately upon Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Sullivan's March againſt the Inhabitants of theſe Parts.</p>
            <p>The Land in this Neighbourhood is excellent for Cultivation, affording very good Paſture.</p>
            <p>Thomas Peart aſſured the Indians, that he, with the other Captives, would not leave them, and therefore requeſted the Favour to be freed from their Confinement at Night; but one of them checked his Requeſt, by ſaying he could not ſleep if the Captives were ſuffered to be untied.</p>
            <p>Their Meat being all exhauſted, Thomas and three Indians went near three Miles to gather more decayed Corn; and this, mouldy as it was, they were obliged to eat, it being their only Food, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few Winter Turneps which they met with. They went forwards a conſiderable Diſtance by the Side of Cayuga Creek, and then with much Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty croſſed it; immediately afterwards they aſcended an uncommon miry Hill, covered with Springs. Going over this Mountain they miſſed the Path, and were obliged to wade very heavily through the Water and Mire.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay they came to a ſine Meadow, where they agreed to continue that Night, having no other Proviſions than the Mouldy
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:018497_0069_0FA7A9B063DAE0F8"/>
Indian Corn they accidentally met with in the Indian Plantations, which had been cut down and left on the Ground by General Sullivan's Army.</p>
            <p>Next Morning they ſet forwards, walking leiſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on, ſo that the Company who went by the other Path might overtake them, and frequently ſtopped for them.</p>
            <p>When Night approached, they came to a large Creek where ſome Indians were, who had begun to prepare the Ground for planting Corn. At this Place they ſtaid two Nights, and being too indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to procure Game by hunting, their Diet was ſtill very poor, and their Strength much exhauſted, ſo that they became impatient of waiting for the others, which was their Intention when they firſt ſtopped.</p>
            <p>After travelling till near Noon, they made a ſhort Stay, ſtripped the Bark off a Tree, and then paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in their Indian Manner, themſelves and the Priſoners on the Body of the Tree; this done, they ſet up a Stick with a Split at the Top, in which they placed a ſmall Buſh of Leaves, and leaned the Stick ſo that the Shadow of the Leaves ſhould fall to the Point of the Stick where it was fixed in the Ground; by which Means the others would be directed in the Time of Day when they left the Place.</p>
            <p>Here they ſeparated the Priſoners again, thoſe to whom Thomas Peart and Joſeph Gilbert were allotted went weſtward out of the Path, but Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah Gilbert and Benjamin Gilbert jun. with one Indian, continued in the Path. This was very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſing to Sarah to be torn from her Relations and deprived of all the Comforts and even Neceſſaries of Life. Theſe two, with the Indian who had the Care of them, after they had parted with the other two and travelled forward a few Miles, came to
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:018497_0070_0FA7A9B127688BF8"/>
ſome Indians by the Side of a Creek, who gave them ſomething to eat. The next Day the Indian who was their Pilot exerted himſelf to obtain ſome Proviſions, but his Endeavours proved fruitleſs, they therefore ſuffered greatly. At Night the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an aſked Sarah if ſhe had ever eaten Horſe-Fleſh, or Dog's; ſhe replied, ſhe had not; he then further ſurpriſed her by aſking whether ſhe had ever eat Man's Fleſh; upon her expreſſing her Abhorrence, he replied that he ſhould be under the Neceſſity of killing the Boy, for he could not procure any Deer. This Threat, altho' perhaps not intended to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, terrified her exceedingly. He hunted with great Diligence, leaving the Captives by themſelves, and appeared to ſhudder himſelf, at what he had theartned, willing to try every <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

They went forwards ſlowly, being very weak, and in addition to their Diſtreſs there fell a very heavy Rain, and they were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to continue in it as they were without Shelter. In this reduced Situation they at Length came to one of the Huts at Canodo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>As the few Days ſolitary Sufferings of Sarah Gilbert had been before unrelated, the foregoing Digreſſion, from the Narrative of Thomas Peart's, may not be thought improper.</p>
            <p>To return to the two who were ſeparated from the Path, and had to go forwards acroſs Mountains and Vallies, Swamps and Creeks.</p>
            <p>In the Morning they eat the Remainder of their Corn. The Indians then cut off their Hair, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting a ſmall rund Touft on the Crown of the Head; and, after painting them in the Indian

Manner, in Order to make them appear more ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, they took from them their Hats. Being thus obliged to travel bare Headed in the Sun, they were ſeized with violent Head achs; and this added to a Want of Proviſions, was truly diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>When they approached the Indian Settlements, the Indians began their cuſtomary Whooping, to announce their Arrival with Priſoners, iſſuing their diſmal Yells according to the Number brought in.</p>
            <p>After ſome ſhort Time an Indian came to them: With him they held a Diſcourſe concerning the Priſoners, and painted them afreſh, part black, and part red, as a diſtinguiſhing Mark. When this Ceremony was concluded, the Indian who met them returned, and the others continued their Route.</p>
            <p>As they were not far from the Indian Towns, they ſoon ſaw great Numbers of the Indians col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting together, though the Priſoners were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Motives.</p>
            <p>When they came up to this diſagreeable Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the Indian who firſt met them, took the String that was about Thomas Peart's Neck with which he had been tied at Night, and held him whilſt a Squaw ſtripped off his Veſt.</p>
            <p>Joſeph Gilbert was ordered to run firſt, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lame and indiſpoſed, could only walk. The Clubs and Tomhaws ſlew ſo thick, that he was ſorely bruiſed, and one of the Tomhawks ſtruck him on the Head and brought him to the Ground, when a Lad of about fifteen Years old run after him, and, as he lay, would undoubtedly have ended him, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:018497_0072_0FA7A9B2A42288B8"/>
After him, Thomas Peart was ſet off; he ſeeing the horrid Situation of his Brother, was ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that he did not recollect the Indian ſtill kept hold of the String which was round his Neck; but, ſpringing forwards with great Force and Swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he pulled the Indian over, who, in Return, when he recovered his Feet, beat him ſeverely with a Club. The Lad who was ſtanding with a Tomhawk near Joſeph Gilbert, as he paſſed by him, threw his Tomhawk with great Dexterity, and would certainly have ſtruck him, if he had not ſprung forwards and avoided the Weapon. When he had got oppoſite to one of their Huts, they pointed for him to take Shelter there, where Joſeph Gilbert came to him as ſoon as he recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In the Room were a Number of Women who appeared very ſorrowful, and wept aloud; this, though cuſtomary amongſt them, ſtill added to the Terror of the Captives, as they imagined it to be no other than a Prelude to inevitable De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
            <p>Their Hair cropt cloſe, their Bodies bruiſed, and the Blood guſhing from Joſeph Gilbert's Wound, rendered them a horrid Spectacle to each other.</p>
            <p>After the Lamentations ceaſed, one of them aſked Thomas Peart, if he was hungry; he replied, he was: They then told him, <g ref="char:startq">“</g>You cat by and by.<g ref="char:endq">”</g> They immediately procured ſome Victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and ſet it before them, but Joſeph Gilbert's Wounds had taken away his Appetite.</p>
            <p>An Officer, who was of the French Families of Canada, came to them, and brought a Negro with him to interpret. After queſtioning them, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded to write to Col. Johnſon, at Niagara, rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the Priſoners.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="unknown:018497_0073_0FA7A9B477CD7A08"/>
The Indians adviſed them to be contented with their preſent Situation, and marry amongſt them, giving every Aſſurance that they ſhould be treated with the utmoſt Reſpect: But theſe Conditions were inadmiſſable.</p>
            <p>After this, Joſeph Gilbert was taken from his Brother, as related in the Narrative of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>Thomas Peart continued at the Village that Night, and the next Day was given to the Care of a young Indian, who went with him about two Miles, where ſeveral Indians were collected, dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in horrid Maſks, in Order, as he ſuppoſed, to make Sport of his Fears, if he diſcovered any: He therefore guarded againſt being ſurpriſed, and when they obſerved him not to be intimidated, they permitted him to return again. Not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his arriving at the Village, Capt. Rowland Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teur came in, who gave Thomat Peart ſome Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count how the others of his Family had ſuffered, and told him that he had almoſt killed his Mother and Jeſſe, on Account of Andrew Harrigar's mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Eſcape. He had come in before the others, in Order to procure ſome Proviſions for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who were in great Need of it.</p>
            <p>When the Captain returned, Thomas Peart ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied him Part of the Way, and the Capt. adviſed him to be cheerful and contented, and work faithful for the Friend, for ſo he ſtyled the Indian under whoſe Care Thomas Peart was plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, promiſing him that if he complied, he ſhould ſhortly go to Niagara.</p>
            <p>They employed him in chopping for ſeveral Days, having previous to this taken the String from his Neck, which they had carefully ſecured him with every Night.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="unknown:018497_0074_0FA7A9B5329B4E98"/>
The Plantation on which they intended to ſix for a Summer Reſidence, and to plant their Crop of Corn, was ſeveral Miles down the Geneſee or Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle River. Prior to their removing with the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſome of the Men went thither and built a Bark Hut, which was expeditiouſly performed, as they executed it in about tow Days, when they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their old Habitation.</p>
            <p>Thomas Peart was the next Day given to the chief Indian, who endeavoured to quiet his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, aſſuring him he ſhould meet with kind Treatment.</p>
            <p>The Indian Manner of Life is remarkably dirty and louſy; and although they themſelves diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard their Filth, yet it was extremely mortifying to the Priſoners to be deprived of the Advantages of Cleanlineſs: And this was by no Means among the Number of ſmaller Difficulties.</p>
            <p>As Thomas Peart had been accuſtomed to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and when firſt among the Indians was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly exerting himſelf, either in their active Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions or uſeful Labour, they were much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with him. When they had conclued upon ſending him to the Family he was to reſide with, they daubed him afreſh with their red Paint. He was then taken about ſeven Miles, where he was adopted into the Family, and ſtyled "Ochnuſa," or Uncle. When the Ceremony of Adoption was performed, a Number of the Relatives were ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned together, and the Head of them took Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Peart into the Midſt of the Aſſembly, and made a long Harrangue in the Indian Language. After this he was taken into the Houſe, where the Women wept aloud for Joy, that the Place of a deceaſed Relation was again ſupplied.</p>
            <p>The old Man, whoſe Place Thomas Peart was to ſill, had never been conſidered by his Family
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:018497_0075_0FA7A9B5A39BFB68"/>
as poſſeſſed of any Merit; and ſtrange as it may appear, the Perſon adopted, always holds in their Eſtimation the Merits or Demerits of the deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and the moſt careful Conduct can never over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come this Prejudice.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Ceremony of Adoption at this Place was finiſhed, he was taken by the Family to Nundow, a Town on the Geneſee River. The Head of this Family was a Chief or King of the Senecas. But before Thomas was fully received into the Family, there was a ſecond Lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>Their Proviſions, notwithſtanding it was a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of great Plenty, was often Deers Guts, dried with the Dung, and all boiled together, which they conſider ſtrong and wholeſome Food. They never throw away any Part of the Game they take.</p>
            <p>Thomas Peart's Dreſs was entirely in the Indian Style, painted and ornamented like one of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, though in a meaner Mannner, as they did not hold him high in Eſteem after his Adoption.</p>
            <p>Greatly diſcontented, he often retired into the Woods, and reflected upon his unhappy Situation, without Hopes of returning to his Relations, or ever being reſcued from Captivity.</p>
            <p>He continued in this ſolitary Secluſion about five Weeks, when their Corn was moſtly conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and as their Dependence for a freſh Supply was on Niagara Fort, they concluded to go thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but at firſt would not conſent that Thomas ſhould accompany them; but he was ſo urgent, they at length conſented, and the next Day they had an Indian Dance preparatory to their Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>In the Route Thomas Peart got a Deer, which was an acceptable Acquiſition, as they had been
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:018497_0076_0FA7A9B665D3E620"/>
for ſome Days without any Meat, and their Corn was likewiſe expended.</p>
            <p>When they came within two Miles of the Fort they halted, and ſtaid there until Morning.</p>
            <p>A white Priſoner, who came from the Fort, gave Thomas Peart a particular Relation of his fellow Captives: This was the firſt Account he had of them ſince their Separation at the Indian Towns. As ſoon as he came to the Fort, he appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſome of the Officers, requeſting their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to procure Thomas's Liberty, if poſſible; but he was diſappointed, as nothing could be then done to ſerve him.</p>
            <p>He eat ſome ſalt Proviſions, which, as he had taſted but little Salt ſince his Captivity, (although pleaſing to his Palate) affected his Stomach, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing difficult for him to digeſt.</p>
            <p>As he was to return with the Indians in about a Week, it was very diſtreſſing, being much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted with the Fare he met amongſt them.</p>
            <p>They returned by Way of Fort Sluſher, and then along Lake Erie, up Buffalo Creek, taking ſome Fiſh as they went. They paſſed by the Place where Elizabeth Peart and Rebecca Gilbert were, but he had not an Opportunity of ſeeing them.</p>
            <p>The Stores they took Home with them, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Rum, Salt, and Ammunition.</p>
            <p>Lake Erie is about three hundred Miles long from Eaſt to Weſt, and about forty in Breadth: It receives its Supply of Waters from Lakes Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, Michigan and Huron, by a North-weſt Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, called the Streights of Detroit. A very long narrow Piece of Land lies on its North Side, which projects remarkably into the Lake, and has been noticed by moſt Travellers, and is known by the Name of Long Point. There are ſeveral Iſlands in it, which, with the Banks of the Lake, were
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:018497_0077_0FA7A9B726C33F90"/>
more infeſted with different Kinds of Snakes, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the Rattle-Snake, than other Places.</p>
            <p>The Navigation of this Lake is allowed to be more dangerous than the others, on Account of the high Lands projecting into it; ſo that when ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Storms ariſe, Boats are frequently loſt, as there are but few Places to land, and ſeldom a Poſſibility of finding a Shelter near the craggy Precipices.</p>
            <p>The Waters of Erie paſs through a North-eaſt Communication into the River Niagara, which, by a No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>herly Courſe of near thirty-ſix Miles, falls into Lake Ontario.</p>
            <p>At the Diſcharge of this River into Lake Onta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> on the Eaſt Side, ſtands Fort Niagara; and at the Entrance from Lake Erie lies Erie Fort; between theſe two Forts are thoſe extraordinary Falls which claim the Attention of the curious, and are amongſt the moſt remarkable Works of Nature.</p>
            <p>This ſtup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ndous Cataract is ſupplied by the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the ſeveral Lakes, and their diſtant Springs; which, after traverſing many hundred Miles, ruſh aſtoniſhingly down a moſt horrid Precipice, and which, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

            <p>The Streight of Niagara is eſteemed dangerous for a Mile or upwards above the Falls. The Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Falls raiſes a very heavy Miſt, ſomewhat reſembling a Continuation of the River, and this Deception, together with the Rapidity of the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, frequently hurries the Ducks and Geeſe down this dreadful Precipice.</p>
            <p>

This vaſt Body of Water, after paſſing through the Streight of Niagara, is received by Lake On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tario, or Cataraqui, which is nearly of an oval Form. Its greateſt Length is from North-eaſt to South-weſt, and is generally allowed to be ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Miles in Circumference. And although the leaſt of the five great Lakes of Canada is much the ſafeſt for Shipping, as the Channel is leſs ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by Rocks or Iſlands, than the other Lakes. The South Side is the moſt commodious for Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teaux and Canoes, having a moderately ſhelving Bank and Shore on that Side: The other is more rocky.</p>
            <p>Many of the Rivers which fall into it, are bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in their Entrances by broken Hills, but the Vallies are uncommonly fertile.</p>
            <p>On the South the moſt conſiderable Rivers which fall into this Lake, are, the great and little Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. The Falls of theſe Rivers, render them not navigable near the Lake; but after the Carrying-places are paſſed, they run ſlow and deep.</p>
            <p>In Order to keep up the Communication be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the different Parts of Canada, there is a Portage from the Landing below Niagara Falls, to the Landing above, up three ſharp Hills, along which, the Road for about eight or nine Miles, has been made as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aſy for Carts as it poſſibly could; (thence to Lake Erie is about eighteen Miles) but the Stream is ſo ſwift here, that it is almoſt impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to ſtem it for a Mile or two in a Ship with the ſtiffeſt Gale; though Batteaux and Canoes Paſs along without much Danger, as the Current is leſs rapid near the Shore. On the North-eaſt it emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties itſelf into the River Cataraqui.</p>
            <p>From this ſhort digreſſive Account of the Lakes, we may return to the Situation of the Priſoner, and the Indian Family:</p>

When they had conſumed their laſt Year's Stock of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>orn, they lived very low, and were reduced to great Neceſſity, digging what wild eſculent Roots they could find; this was ſo different from what he had been accuſtomed to, that he could not bear it with that Cheerfulneſs with which the Indians met ſuch Difficulties. His painful Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Want of Neceſſaries, reduced him exceeding low.</p>
            <p>Whilſt in this Diſtreſs, he happily obtained the Uſe of a Teſtament from a white Woman, who had been taken Captive, and afterwards married amongſt them: With this ſolacing Companion, he frequently retired into the Woods, and employed himſelf in reading and meditating upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction couched in it.</p>
            <p>The Indians directed a white Girl to inform him, that they intended a Hunt of twenty Days, and were deſirous he ſhould attend them; to this he agreed, and the whole Family accompanied the Hunters. They paſſed by the Town where Joſeph Gilbert was, who informed his Brother that he was going to Niagara: Thomas Peart replied he had already been there, and then informed him how the others of their Relations were diſperſed.</p>
            <p>On their Way up the Geneſee River, where they intended to hunt, they took a Deer.</p>
            <p>The fourth Day, as Thomas Peart was beating for Game, he loſt his Company; but at Length came to ſome Indians who directed him. When he came to the Family, much fatigued, and told them he had been loſt, they were very much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted at the perplexing Situation he had been in.</p>
            <p>The next Day they moved further, hunting as they went, and in the Evening fixed their Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>s, where they ſtaid two Nights.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="unknown:018497_0080_0FA7A9B965B8EBE0"/>
Thomas Peart, not endeavouring to pleaſe them, they took Umbrage at his Neglect: This, added to a Fit of the Ague, induced them to leave him in the Woods, he being ſo weak he could not keep up with them, and was obliged to follow by their Tracks in the Leaves.</p>
            <p>Their Proviſions ſoon began to waſte, and it was not long before it was entirely conſumed; and as they took no Game, they were under the Neceſſity of eating wild Cherries.</p>
            <p>The Proſpect appeared very gloomy to our Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, to be thus diſtreſſed with Hunger, and to be from Home near one hundred Miles with the whole Family: But this Situation, though ſo alarming to him, did not appear to reach their Stoic Inſenſibility. In this Extremity one of the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans killed a fine Elk, which was a long wiſhed-for and delightful Supply; but as the Weather was very warm, and they had no Salt, it ſoon became putrid, and filled with Maggots, which they, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, eat without Reſerve.</p>
            <p>After they had been out upwards of thirty Days, the Indians changed their Courſe, towards their own Habitation, making but little Progreſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, as they kept hunting as they went. And as Thomas had long been uneaſy, and deſirous to return, not expecting to have been abſent more than twenty Days, they gave him ſome Directions and a ſmall Share of Proviſions; he then left them after an unſucceſsful Hunt of forty Days: And, although weak and unfit for the Journey, he ſet off in the Morning, and kept as near a North-weſt Courſe as he could, going as faſt as his Strength would permit over large Creeks, Swamps and rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Hills; and when Night came on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made up a ſmall Fire, and being exceedingly fatigued, ſaid
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:018497_0081_0FA7A9BA2460B2C8"/>
himſelf down on the Ground, and ſlept very ſoundly: In the Morning he continued his Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.</p>
            <p>When he conſidered the great Diſtance through the Woods to the Indian Towns, and the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of procuring Game to ſubſiſt on, it dejected him greatly. His Spirits were ſo depreſſed, that when his Fire was extinguiſhed in the Night, he even heard the wild Beaſts walking and howling around him, without regarding them, as with all his Exertions and Aſſiduity, he had but ſmall Hope of ever reaching the Towns, but providenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally he ſucceeded.</p>
            <p>On the Journey he eat a Land Tortoiſe, ſome Roots and wild Cherries.</p>
            <p>When he reached the Town, the Indians were pleaſed with his Return, and inquired the Reaſon of his coming alone, and where he had left the Family he went with; which he fully informed them of.</p>
            <p>This being the Time for feaſting on their new Crop of Corn, and they having plenty of Pump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins and Squaſhes, gave an agreeable Proſpect of a ſhort Seaſon of Health, and frequent, though ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Feaſts.</p>
            <p>About ten Days after this, the Family returned; they ſoon inquired if Thomas Peart had reached Home, and upon being informed that he had, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied that it was not expected he ever could.</p>
            <p>The Indians concluding to make a War Excurſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, aſked Thomas to with them; but he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately refuſed them, and was therefore left at Home with the Family; and not long after had Permiſſion to viſit his Brother Benjamin Peart, who was then about fifteen or eighteen Miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, down the Geneſee River.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="83" facs="unknown:018497_0082_0FA7A9BAE6883A30"/>
Benjamin Peart was at that Time very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed: Thomas, therefore, ſtaid with him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Days, and, when he recovered a little Strength, left him, and returned to his old Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>He was thoroughly acquainted with the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, Manners and Diſpoſitions of the Indians, and obſerving that they treated him juſt as they had done the old worthleſs Indian, in whoſe Place he was adopted, he having been conſidered a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite of the Squaws; he therefore concluded he would only fill his Predeceſſor's Station, and uſed no Endeavours to pleaſe them, as his Buſineſs was to cut Wood for the Family; notwithſtanding he might eaſily have procured a ſufficient Store, yet he was not ſo diſpoſed, but often refuſed, and even left it for the Squaws ſometimes to do themſelves, not doubting if he was diligent and careful, they would be leſs willing to give him his Liberty.</p>
            <p>Joſeph Gilbert came to ſee him, and, as has been mentioned, informed him of the Deceaſe of their Father.</p>
            <p>Some Time in the Fall, the King (whoſe Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Thomas was called) died, and he was directed to hew Boards and make a Coſſin for him; when it was compleated, they ſmeared it with red Paint. The Women, whoſe Attention to this is always inſiſted on amongſt the Indians, kept the Corps for ſeveral Days, when they prepared a Grave, and interred him; it being conſidered amongſt this Tribe, diſgraceful for a Man to take any No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this ſolemn and intereſting Scene. A Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Squaws collected upon this Occaſion, and there was great Mourning, which they continued for ſeveral Days at ſtated Times. As the Place of Interment, as well as that appointed for weeping,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:018497_0083_0FA7A9BBA3C07358"/>
was near the Hut Thomas Peart reſided at, he had an Opportunity of indulging his Curioſity, through the Openings of the Logs, without giving Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>Soon after this, one of the Women who was called Thomas's Siſter, deſired him to accompany her about fifty Miles towards Niagara. Some others of the Family went with them, and in their Way they took a Deer and other Game.</p>
            <p>They were from Home on this Journey about ſix Days; during the Time, there fell a very heavy Snow, which made their Journey toilſome. The Women were ſent homeward before the reſt, to prepare ſomething againſt they came.</p>
            <p>When they had loitered at Home a few Days, they ſet about gathering their Winter Store of Hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kory-nuts: From ſome of them they extracted an Oil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which they eat with Bread or Meat, at their Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Frequently before they ſet off on their Hunting Parties, they make an Indian Frolick; when, commonly, all the Company become extravagantly intoxicated: And when they intend to go off this Winter, they firſt give the preparatory Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>After they were gone, Thomas Peart and the Miſtreſs of the Family diſagreeing, ſhe inſiſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his joining to the Hunters, and living on the Game, that ſhe might ſave more Corn. He plead the Coldneſs of the Seaſon, and his Want of Cloathing, but it would not avail; he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore turned out, and upon finding the Hunters, he built them Hut, where they ſtaid for ſome Weeks, taking the Game, and eating wild Meat without Corn, as the Supply they had raiſed was ſhort.</p>
            <p>When they were weary with their Employ, they moved to their old Hut, and lived in their idle
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:018497_0084_0FA7A9BD943CE0B0"/>
Manner for a long Time. They then again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to their Hut, and ſtaid about ten Days, and took ſeveral Deer.</p>
            <p>A few Days after their Return from hunting, they acquainted Thomas that they ſhould ſet off for Niagara; which was truly grateful to him. There were fifteen of them on this Viſit. The old Woman gave Thomas Peart a ſtrict Charge to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn.</p>
            <p>Although the Proſpect of ſeeing or hearing from his Relations was delightful, yet the Journey was exceſſively painful; the Snow covering the Ground to a conſiderable Depth, the Cold increaſed, and they had to wade through ſeveral deep Creeks, the Water often freezing to their Legs; and Thomas Peart, as well as the Reſt, were uncloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, excepting a Blanket and Pair of Leggings.</p>
            <p>In five Days they came to Fort Sluſher, and at the Treats they there received, were moſt of them drunk for the Day.</p>
            <p>Next Morning they went to Niagara, where he immediately made Application to the Britiſh Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to ſolicit his Releaſe. Capt. Powell informed Col. Johnſon, who requeſted it of the Indians; they required ſome Time to deliberate upon the Subject, not willing to diſoblige the Col. and at Length concluded to comply with his Requeſt; telling him, that however hard it might be to part with their own Fleſh, yet, to pleaſe him, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to it, hoping he would make them ſome Preſent.</p>
            <p>Col. Johnſon then directed him to his own Houſe, and deſired him to clean himſelf, and ſent Cloaths for him to dreſs with. Here he had Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſalt Proviſions, and every Neceſſary of Life: This, with the happy regaining of his Liberty,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:018497_0085_0FA7A9BE3458B608"/>
gave a new Spring to his Spirits, and, for a few Days, he ſcarcely knew how to enjoy ſufficiently, this almoſt unlooked-for Change.</p>
            <p>When recruited, he went to work for Col. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and a few Weeks after had the Satisfaction of his Brother Benjamin Peart's Company; who, though not releaſed, yet was permitted to ſtay at the Fort, and worked with his Brother until Spring; when Capt. Powell, Lieutenant Johnſon, and Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Peart went up Buffalo Creek, with two Boats loaded with Proviſions, and a Proportion of plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Corn, together with Hoes, to be diſtributed among the Indians.</p>
            <p>In this Expedition Thomas had the Satisfaction of ſeeing and converſing with his Siſter Rebecca, which was the firſt of their Meeting together, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Separation of a Year.</p>
            <p>At the Diſtribution of the Corn and Hoes, the Indians met and made a general Feaſt; after which, they diſperſed; and the Officers, when they had compleated their Buſineſs, returned to Niagara, after an Abſence of eight or nine Days.</p>
            <p>Thomas Peart was ſettled at Col. Johnſon's, to work for him at two Shillings and ſix Pence per Day, till the eighth Month, when ſix of the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives were ſent to Montreal, and Thomas alſo had Permiſſion to go, but he choſe rather to ſtay, to afford his Aſſiſtance to his Siſter Rebecca Gilbert, and his Couſin Benjamin Gilbert, jun. who yet remained in Captivity; exerting himſelf as ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly as poſſible on their Behalf.</p>
            <p>In the Fall, he went up again to Buffalo Creek, where he ſaw his Siſter and Couſin a ſecond Time, and aſſured his Siſter that the Col. intended to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on her being relaſed: This encouraged her to hope.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="unknown:018497_0086_0FA7A9BEA44391C0"/>
The Indians are too indolent to employ ſufficient Pains to preſerve their Grain in the Winter; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thoſe who plant near the Fort, generally ſend the greater Part to the Engliſh to preſerve for them, and take it back as they want it: Therefore, what this Neighbourhood had more than for a ſhort Supply, they carried with them in their Boats to the Fort.</p>
            <p>In the Winter, Thomas Peart undertook to chop Wood for the Britiſh Officers, and built himſelf a Hut about two Miles from the Fort, in which he lodged at Night. A drunken Indian came to his Cabbin one Evening with his Knife in his Hand, with an Intention of Miſchief; but, being debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated with Liquor, Thomas Peart eaſily wreſted his Knife from him.</p>
            <p>A Wolf came one Night up to the Door of his Cabbin, which he diſcovered next Morning, by the Tracks in the Snow; and, a few Nights after, paid a ſecond Viſit, when he fired at him, and, by the Blood on the Snow, ſuppoſed he had mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded him.</p>
            <p>Next Spring, Thomas went with the Officers again up Buffalo Creek, when he afreſh animated his Siſter, by informing her that General Haldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand had given Orders to the Officers, to procure their Liberty.</p>
            <p>As they returned by Fort Erie, their Boats were in Danger from the Ice in the Lake and River. It continues in theſe Parts until late in the Spring; ſometimes as late as the fifth Month; and, as ſoon as melted, the Vegetation is aſtoniſhingly quick.</p>
            <p>About two Weeks after they returned, Thomas Peart went back again with ſome Officers, who were going to the Indians.</p>
            <p>After a Tour of fifteen Days, he came again to the Fort, where he ſtaid for ſeveral Weeks,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:018497_0087_0FA7A9BF6510A1D8"/>
and received ſeveral Letters from his Relations, at Montreal, by ſome Officers who were on their Way to Cataraguors, on Lake Erie, about eighty Miles from Niagara; who, in their Way, ſaw Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becca and Benjamin Gilbert, jun. with a Number of Indians, going for Niagara. Thomas Peart made as quick Diſpatch as poſſible, to meet them, delighted with the Proſpect of their obtaining their Liberty.</p>
            <p>They took a Porcupine, which is ſomewhat larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than a Rackoon, and covered remarkably with Quills of Bone, about eight or nine Inches long, which they can diſcharge with ſuch Force, as to penetrate through a Man's Hand at a conſiderable Diſtance.</p>
            <p>A few Days after he returned from this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the Captives were delivered up: Theſe two had been with the Indians upwards of two Years.</p>
            <p>In a ſhort Time after their Releaſe, Thomas Peart procured Permiſſion for them and himſelf to proceed to Montreal, and was furniſhed with a Paſs, containing an Order to obtain what Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions they might be in Want of in their Paſſage.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Day of the ſixth Month, 1782, they went on Board the Ship Limner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and proceeded towards Montreal. When they came againſt the Place where their Father was interred, thoſe whom they were with, gave Thomas and Rebecca No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, though they did not land, but purſued their Voyage; and, after being ſeven Days on the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they reached Fort Laſheen, where they ſtaid that Night, and the next Day went to Montre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to their Relations: Soon after which, a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was received from the before mentioned Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin Gilbert, then at Caſtleton, acquainting them of his being ſo far on his Way to Montreal, in
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:018497_0088_0FA7A9C0261F9138"/>
Order to give them Aſſiſtance in getting Home, and requeſting that Permiſſion might be obtained for his Coming in; which, Elizabeth immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately applyed to the Officers for: Who, with great Cheerfulneſs, wrote in her Behalf to General Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimand, at Quebec, who readily granted her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, together with other Favours to Elizabeth, worthy of her grateful Remembrance; by which Means, Benjamin's Arrival at Montreal was ſoon effected, where he had the Pleaſure once more of ſeeing and converſing with his Relations and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Connexions, to their great Joy and Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after an Abſence of near three Years; during which Time, they had but little if any certain Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of each other.</p>
            <p>After ſome Time ſpent in inquiring after their Relatives and Friends, and converſing on the once unthought of and ſtrange Scenes of Life they had paſſed through ſince their Separation, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came neceſſary to prepare for their Journey home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which was accordingly done, and in about five Weeks from the Time of Benjamin's Arrival, they took Leave of the Friends and Acquaintances they had made during their Reſidence there; whoſe hoſpitable and kind Treatment, merits their grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſincere Acknowledgements, and moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Deſires for their Welfare in every Scene. And on the twenty-ſecond Day of the eighth Month, 1782, attended by a great Number of the Inhabitants, they embarked in Boats prepared for them, and took their Departure. Having croſſed the River, and Carriages being provided, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on their Journey without much Delay, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they came to St. John's, where they went on Board a Sloop; but the Winds being unfavourable, rendered their Paſſage in the Lake ſomewahat te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="unknown:018497_0089_0FA7A9C0E490AC08"/>
They did not arrive at Crown-Point, until about two Weeks after their Departure from Montreal. They continued here ſeveral Days, and from thence went in open Boats to Eaſt-Bay in about two Days, where they landed and ſtaid all Night, and were next Day delivered up to the Officers of Vermont. Here ſome of the Company ſtaid two Nights, on Account of Benjamin Peart's Child being very ill; by which Time it ſo recovered, that they proceeded on to Caſtleton, where thoſe that went before had halted, and near that Place ſtay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all Night, and in the Morning Elizabeth the Mother having engaged to do an Errand for a Friend, was under a Neceſſity of riding about thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-five Miles, which occaſioned her to be abſent two Nights from the Family, who were at Capt. Willard's; at which Place Benjamin provided Horſes and Waggons for the Remainder of the Journey, together with ſome Proviſions. Here they were very civilly treated, and generouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertained free of Expence.</p>
            <p>The Family then proceeded on, and met their Mother at the Houſe of Capt. Lonſon, where they ſtaid that Night, and until Noon next Day, and were alſo kindly treated by him.</p>
            <p>Continuing their Journey, they met with John Bracanage (who, together with Capt. Lanſon, were Paſſengers with them to Eaſt-Bay) he gave them an Invitation to his Houſe, which they accepted, and arrived there about Noon next Day, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with him two Nights, and were reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully entertained.</p>
            <p>Having prepared for proſecuting their Journey, the proceeded on for the North-River, where they met with Lot Trip and William Knowles, who kindly conducted the Women to the Houſe of David Sands, where they lodged that Night. The
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:018497_0090_0FA7A9C1A5253F30"/>
reſt of the Family came to them in the Morning, and ſeveral of them attended Friends Meeting, not having had the like Opportunity for ſeveral Years before.</p>
            <p>In the Afternoon they purſued their Journey, the before mentioned Lot Trip and William Knowles accompanying them, and being in a Waggon, kindly took Elizabeth and her younger Daughter Paſſengers with them, which proved a conſiderable Relief.</p>
            <p>In a few Days they came into Pennſylvania, where they met with ſome of their Relations and former Acquaintances and Friends, who were unitedly rejoiced at the happy Event of once more ſeeing and converſing with them.</p>
            <p>The next Day, being the twenty-eighth Day of the ninth Month, 1782, they arrived at Byberry, the Place of their Nativity, and the Reſidence of their neareſt Connexions and Friends, where Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth and her Children were once more favoured with the agreeable Opportunity of ſeeing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with her ancient Mother, together with their other neareſt Relatives and Friends, to their mutual Joy and Satisfaction; under which happy Circumſtance we now leave them.</p>
