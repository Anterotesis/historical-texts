            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>HAD we aſſembled this day, my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-citizens, for the purpoſe of private mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that we might ſympathize with a diſtreſſed family deprived of a parent, or weep over the ruins of youth and beauty when conveyed to the tomb, our conduct would deſerve approbation and reſpect. We are MEN, and therefore, I truſt, never inſenſible of the calls of humanity. An event far more important arreſts our notice, and hath given birth to the ſolemnities of the day. The common triumphs of the laſt enemy of man, though ſevere and terrible; yet are ſhort in their effects. When <hi>one generation paſſeth away</hi> another

riſes in its place. When wiſe and good men of local eminence retire from the world, others are raiſed up by Providence to fill their ſtations. If the flowers are deſtroyed by the ſeverity of winter froſts, ſtill the ſpring will repair their ravages. Though the ſun <hi>goeth down</hi> in the weſtern hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere he will again ariſe, he will ſhine on new forms of beauty in the natural world—and on a new ſucceſſion of rational beings, who in turn muſt pay the like tribute to mortality. But when will the beams of that glorious luminary again be reflected on ſuch an object as we now lament; when in any future period will they behold one, who like him, ſo perfectly united in himſelf the amiable citizen, the uncorrupt patriot, and the invincible hero; one whom we know not whether more to love for the excellent qualities of his heart, or admire for his peerleſs greatneſs and ſplendid appearance on the human drama? Our <hi>civil Fathers</hi> have pronounced him "Firſt in War, Firſt in peace, and Firſt in the affections of the people." The re-echoing groans and ſighs of millions of our nation, have demonſtrated their warm approbation of the ſentiment.</p>
            <p>THIS day, devoted to funeral honors, which before had been dedicated to joy and innocent
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:038622_0004_1012A9686F5C5BF0"/>
amuſements, as the nativity of the political ſaviour of his country: this day, witneſſes our keen ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities for his death, and our unaffected gratitude to his memory.</p>
            <p>IN paying due honours and the laſt offices of reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, in our power, to the higheſt grade of human virtue, we copy after the beſt and faireſt exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of antiquity, both ſacred and profane. Even in the pure and ſimple ages of the world we find the patriarch Jacob followed to the grave by all his countrymen and kindred, as well as by the Egyptian Court. The children of Iſrael mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thirty days for Moſes their illuſtrious leader, who delivered them from ſlavery, and conducted them to Canaan. The princes and patriots of the ſame nation, were honoured after their exit by all the ſignals of public mourning—and the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of David exiſted for more than a thouſand years.</p>
            <p>THE Athenians, renowned through the world for their great wiſdom and acquirements, though ſo jealous of their liberties that they baniſhed from their country citizens, whoſe power, or even vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, gave them too great an aſcendancy; yet granted to the ſame, as well as to other great men,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:038622_0005_1012A96CA8343898"/>
who were their benefactors, funeral honours which equalled in pomp and magnificence their religious ſolemnities. In other nations of Greece, as well as among the Romans, the inventors of Arts and Sciences; the authors of free governments, and the deſtroyers of tyranny; thoſe who had fought and died for their country, have been held in the higheſt veneration. They were admitted even to divine honours, their deeds of glory have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by the hiſtorian, have been embelliſhed by the orator, and ſounded by the poet. The arts of painting and of ſtatuary have lent their aid— that after ages might not only be favored with the diſplay of their minds, but gratified in beholding —the very image of their perſons. Criminal and ungrateful ſhould we be, my fellow townſmen, if we ſuffered our illuſtrious Friend to depart from life without mingling our tears with the reſt of our countrymen. Is it not the duty of America to exhibit ſuch an example of wiſdom and virtue— ſuch courage, public ſpirit, and uſefulneſs to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as a model for poſterity? Our hearts give a ſufficient reply—he is worthy of our love and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration—and he ſhall ever retain them. "On ſuch ſacrifices (to uſe a bold figure of antiquity) the Gods themſelves ſtrow incenſe."</p>

               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:038622_0006_1012A96F8D59BD68"/>UNDER patience of this reſpectable audience, we ſhall proceed to a review of the more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant paſſages of his life. Though your organ con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes himſelf unequal to the ſublimity of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; yet impreſſed with the higheſt ſenſe of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude to the Father of his country—and the moral obligation on every citizen of the United States to reverence his memory and ſuitably contemplate this melancholy event—he hopes his beſt efforts to comply with your wiſhes may compenſate for his want of abilities or eloquence.</p>
            <p>GEORGE WASHINGTON was born the eleventh of <hi>February</hi> 1732, of an ancient and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable family in the Commonwealth of <hi>Virginia.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>In one edition of Dr. <hi>MORSE's</hi> Geography, in a ſhort biographical account of General <hi>WASHINGTON,</hi> it is ſaid—"That his anceſtors were Royaliſts and emigrated to <hi>Virginia,</hi> after the death of <hi>Charles I.</hi> when <hi>England</hi> became a Republic." The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extract from <hi>Oldmixon</hi>'s hiſtory of <hi>England,</hi> publiſhed A. D. <hi>1730,</hi> affords a corroborating proof of that aſſertion.</p>
                  <p>"In <hi>1643.</hi> Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> with an army of <hi>20,000</hi> horſe and foot, coming before <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and the ſummons being refuſed, laid ſiege to it, and the next day gave a fierce aſſault, but was beaten off. He continued his attacks with great reſolution, and was as reſolutely reſiſted, till Col. <hi>WASHINGTON</hi> gained the out works, and made a breach in the wall."</p>
               </note> Strong powers of mind, a good private educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038622_0007_1012A9711E034210"/>
and a robuſt conſtitution fitted him very early to appear in public life—and to render important ſervices to his country, as well as to give ſtrong preſages of his future greatneſs; even at an age when young gentlemen of fortune are too apt to be rioting in luxury and diſſipation. For before he arrived at the age which the laws of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try conſider as manhood, he was delegated by his native Colony to remonſtrate againſt the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the French and Indians on their weſtern frontiers. War ſucceeding, he was appointed to the command of a provincial regiment in that army, of which <hi>BRADDOCK</hi> was General. There he diſcovered the force of his genius in warlike affairs, by uniting the ardour and courage of a young man with the penetration and ſkill of a vet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eran ſoldier. He remonſtrated with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander againſt the arrangments of the battle; and when he could not convince that obſtinate man, who fell a deſerved ſacrifice to his preſumption and ignorance, the great WASHINGTON, at twenty-two years of age, covered and protected the retreating army. Such were the hopes excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his abilities and virtue, that even then he was deſignated in prophetic language to be the future ſaviour of America. Theſe were exploits ſufficient for the morning of a brilliant life, and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:038622_0008_1012A9744A782530"/>
enough to have procured him an honourable name on the hiſtorick page. Yet they are loſt by the contemplation of the numerous and more impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant events which ſucceeded.—As theſe are more intereſting, let us follow him in his career.</p>
            <p>HAVING gone through the ſeveral grades of Legiſlator and Magiſtrate in his native province, he was appointed in 1774, a Delegate to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Congreſs. He ſincerely joined with that hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable band of Patriots, in every effort to reſtore the violated rights of his country, without a civil war. But their attempts were fruitleſs. The more humbly they petitioned, the more haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they were rejected by the Government of Great Britain. At length, when all other reſources fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, an appeal was made to Heaven, to be decided by the ſword. At that time, America was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out arms, amunition, money, or publick credit. No inconſiderable proportion of her citizens be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came her avowed enemies. Theſe, from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the royal governors, were, many of them, poſſeſſed of publick offices, and had great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and conſideration in ſociety. Though the people at large were united, yet numerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingences might have deſtroyed an alliance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by common danger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:038622_0009_1012A975D9FFE628"/>THE nation, with whom we contended, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded an extenſive revenue and an unlimited credit; abounding in military reſources. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent triumphs of her arms in Europe and Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ica, had been heard by all, and witneſſed by no inconſiderable proportion of the world. She ſent over generals to command her armies, who had been fluſhed with conqueſt; and a navy—the terror of all maritime powers. She directed her inſtruments of vengeance and death to deſtroy property and life, as far as each might be neceſſary to reduce us to unqualified ſubmiſſion. In this ſtate of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal anxiety and diſmay, the attention and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining hopes of Congreſs were directed to our departed FATHER; by their unanimous ſuffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, he was choſen CAPTAIN GENERAL of the armies of the United States. It was then in the day of your calamity, that he abandoned ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery domeſtick comfort—left the enjoyment of an opulent fortune, and expoſed his precious and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable life, that he might defend your cauſe and eſtabliſh your independence. With induſtry, he diſciplined your armies; with prudence, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed your weakneſs, not only from your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but from yourſelves. With equal ſkill and fortitude (under the ſmiles of Heaven) he drove the Britiſh forces from yonder city.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:038622_0010_1012A97C9FAE2738"/>SHALL we retroſpect this illuſtrious MAN in his retreat through the Jerſies, like another <hi>Eneas,</hi> carrying with him the hopes and fortunes of his country? Great and venerable in adverſity, he was himſelf an hoſt. Though by ſickneſs and ill ſucceſs, our army was nearly annihilated; yet while WASHINGTON lived, it was accounted criminal to deſpair of the Commonwealth.—Ye war-worn veterans, whoſe aged heads are covered with the "bloſſoms of the grave," ſpeak, for you can tell! You, who have ſo often followed and attended this wonderful MAN through the viciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of the late revolution, and to whoſe co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating valour we are indebted for our <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Independence.</hi> How dauntleſs and unappalled in the midſt of ſurrounding dangers! How often hath he waſted the midnight lamp in planning for your and our ſafety! As you have ſeen his fortitude under the ſevereſt ſhocks of fortune; ſo have you known his humanity after ſucceſs. The vanquiſhed found in him, not an implacable victor, but a generous and ſympathizing friend. What attention and kindneſs did he not diſplay to the brave compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of his danger? He bled for your wounds; and, like the Emperor Trajan, was ready to tear his garments, that he might bind them up. Was

there one of your number, who was not willing to die fighting under his banner? or who would not have coveted the ſacrifice of his own life to protect that of his General? In a word, who did not ſubmit to his commands from motives of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, rather than fear?</p>
            <p>AT the cloſe of the late war, when murmurs for <hi>unrewarded ſervices</hi> and <hi>cruelly neglected merits</hi> had pervaded the camps, and nearly introduced a civil war, the powerful influence of this invariable FRIEND to his country, like the fabled viſage and aſcenſions of the Monarch of the Ocean, calmed the ſtorm, quenched the torch of diſcord, and ſaid to the impetuous paſſions "peace be ſtill."</p>
            <p>BY the gracious interpoſition of Almighty God, the war with Britain was brought to a favourable iſſue, and the national ſovereignty of America was acknowledged by her enemies. This great man did then retire to domeſtic occupation—like the famous Dictator <hi>Cincinnatus.</hi> He ſought in the ſhades of private life the bleſſings for which he had contended with ſucceſs, taking at the ſame time a farewell of all public honours and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:038622_0012_1012A98018987E58"/>BUT had he not now done enough for his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try? Was he not crowned with unwithering laurels? Was not the orb of his glory full? Enough it may be anſwered for any other hero or ſtateſman. But yet from our illuſtrious PARENT immortal ſervices were to be performed in a mortal life. It was not only neceſſary that he ſhould lay the foundations, but that he ſhould complete the ſuperſtructure of LIBERTY in theſe American regions.—In the year 1787, he was ſent as a delegate to a Convention, convoked under the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the ſeveral ſtates in the union, to form a general conſtitution. That body of ſages choſe him to preſide in their aſſembly. When this ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem was adopted, the univerſal wiſhes and ſuffrages of the people created him their ſupreme political head. To any other man but GEORGE WASHINGTON, this exalted ſtation would have been the higheſt object of ambition. But when it is conſidered that he had already acquired the univerſal good will of his country, and a repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which could ſcarcely be increaſed, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the voice of his fellow-citizens, was a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,—yea, a ſacrifice which added to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of our obligations to his memory, for it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated that he was not only willing to expoſe his life, but even hazard his fame, when the ſacred
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038622_0013_1012A98446F5AD60"/>
calls of duty and the publick neceſſity demanded it at his hands.</p>
            <p>HOW wiſely he aſſiſted in organizing this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, in reconciling contending parties, in guarding againſt foreign influence, in preſerving our neutrality, and finally in performing the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and arduous duties of his exalted ſtation, I ſhall leave to be recorded by ſome future hiſtorian, and properly tranſmitted to the important tribunal of poſterity.—Thus much it is proper to obſerve, that though very different apprehenſions were formed of the events of that day; yet all great and good men who differed from our Preſident in his political adminiſtration, reverenced the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his motives, and rectitude of his heart.</p>
            <p>WHEN eight years of his valuable and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant life had been devoted to the intereſts of his native land—when different parties were in ſome meaſure compoſed, and the government ſtrengthened by time and habit, and the acceſſion of all the ſtates, he quitted his high and exalted ſtation, with more pleaſure than it would have been received by the moſt ſanguine votary of ambition and power.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:038622_0014_1012A9872AECAD90"/>NO long interval exiſted from his reſignation of the Preſidency, before he was once more called into publick life. The violent revolutions in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, threatening America with the danger of a war—he accepted the command of our army, in a rank inferior to what he had poſſeſſed before. This elevation of ſoul, ſuperior to all common notions of grandeur, reminds us of the old vener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Roman, who when he had gone through all the publick grades of office, fought as a private under his own ſon when Conſul.</p>
            <p>THUS honourable, thus truly uſeful and emin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently great, was our beloved PARENT in his publick character.—Thus gloriouſly did he diſcharge every duty in peace and war, which his country aſſigned him. We ſhould do criminal injuſtice not only to his memory, but to ſociety, were we here to cloſe, and omit to declare his private virtues, as an example for the world. This part of the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is by no means unimportant; for his amiable qualities when properly exhibited, may be as much more uſeful than thoſe of an obſcure citizen, poſſeſſing the ſame meaſures of moral and ſocial virtue, as his name and influence is more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:038622_0015_1012A988B978BCF0"/>THOUGH poſſeſſed of a ſplendid fortune, he did not feel himſelf raiſed above the duties of induſtry, and the common calls of private life. He obſerved ſuch method and order in the management of his affairs, that notwithſtanding his repeated liberal do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, and princely hoſpitality, he greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed his paternal eſtate. As a huſband, he was ſuch an example of conſtancy and tender affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as proved that the <hi>amiable</hi> may be united with the <hi>ſublime,</hi> in the moral character. As a maſter, he united dignity and authority with ſuch mildneſs of temper, as procured prompt obedience and warm attachment. And it is worthy of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that in all the important ſcenes he hath paſſed through, and the high truſts he was obliged to repoſe on the fidelity of his attendants, that there never hath appeared an inſtance of treachery in any member of his family. While this demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates his penetration and inſight of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture—it evidences the excellency of his heart and manners, in thus commanding the good affections and eſteem of all degrees of men. Far from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the brilliancy of his publick character as a mantle for his private vices, he was uniformly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect. His manners were affable, but dignified. In a word, ſuch was his attention to decorum and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038622_0016_1012A98CE49645A0"/>
propriety, that no man dared to profane his feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings by vicious or indecent converſation.</p>
            <p>IN this age of infidelity and licentiouſneſs, he was not aſhamed to avow and honour the ſyſtem of Chriſtianity. He frequently attended its publick inſtitutions, and in his laſt addreſs has warmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended religion to the notice of his fellow-citizens.</p>
            <p>THE laſt authenticated act of his life was wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of himſelf. In his laſt will and teſtament, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides having beſtowed large ſums for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of literature and publick utility, he hath lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erated all the Africans who belonged to his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. He was obliged to poſtpone his noble and generous deſign during his life, on account of the ſituation of the ſouthern ſtates. Yet he took care to furniſh thoſe men with ſuch inſtructions, as would qualify them for freedom, and hath made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the ſupport of the old and infirm, as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation for their paſt labours. Thus <hi>uniform</hi> in all his conduct, was this FRIEND of the <hi>Rights of Mankind</hi>—thus conſiſtent, were his <hi>Republican Principles.</hi>

            <p>A SUMMARY review of the character of this
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:038622_0017_1012A98FC887DA68"/>
great MAN, will afford ſufficient reaſons for the applauſes which his country hath beſtowed on his actions, and the uncommon honours which have been paid to his memory.</p>
            <p>HAD any one, ſkilled in military affairs, beheld him forming and diſciplining his army—perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt arduous enterprizes, executing all the duties of a conſummate general, ſubduing the proud and expreſſing humanity to the vanquiſhed, he would have concluded that WASHINGTON muſt have been born in a camp, and warlike glory had been his only purſuit. Was our illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious CHIEF to have been viewed as a ſtateſman, a lawgiver and preſident—the inference would have been that his higheſt ambition was to be a ſage and patriot—and that his whole employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was political ſtudies.</p>
            <p>HAD a philoſopher viewed the undeviating purity of his morals—and the elevation and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity of his mind in receiving the higheſt honours and plaudits ever given to mere man, without the leaſt token of inſolence or vanity; would he not have tranſported himſelf in idea to Athens—and imagined that WASHINGTON, in the Grove of Plato, had learned to ſubdue all
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:038622_0018_1012A992A23216E0"/>
paſſions, riſe above all ſublunary grandeur, and to place his whole happineſs in intellectual pleaſures and the cultivation of his ſoul!</p>
            <p>THOUGH we doubt not, other Generals have been equally brave in the field, conducted equally difficult enterprizes, and made more ſplendid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts; other Patriots and Sages have had an equal affection for their country, and have been ready to devote their talents to preſerve, or die to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend its liberties; and other private citizens have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled him in moral and ſocial duties: yet, where is the man (the inſpired characters recorded in the holy ſcriptures excepted) who hath united in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſuch meaſures of military, political and moral excellence? We ſhould do injuſtice by comparing him with any one exalted name which hath been celebrated through the world. As a balanced compariſon to his character, we muſt call up to memory a conſtellation of the brighteſt luminaries of all antiquity, or all the "ſons of glory," in modern times.</p>
            <p>MIGHT not our beloved FATHER have made the ſame declaration in his laſt moments with Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles, the Athenian, "That no American had ſhed a tear by his means"? or like the Emperor

            <p>AS to WASHINGTON, he hath raiſed a monument, which no revolutions or commotions in the natural or moral world can overturn.
