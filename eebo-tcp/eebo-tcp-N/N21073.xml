            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE JOURNAL OF WILLIAM SCUDDER.</head>
            <p>I WAS born at Weſtfield, in New-Jerſey, and for a number of years in my youth could never ſay that I enjoyed a ſtate of health; however, my days glided on until at the age of twenty-two years, when I was united in the bands of matrimony to a perſon who was not my choice. Here it may not be improper to caution all parents againſt too much rigidneſs in the choice of their children's marrying. In caſe of any accident, perſuaſions and good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ought juſtly to be exerciſed; but to lay a poſitive command, and put it in force, brings an endleſs and living ſorrow upon the married pair; at the ſame time I would particularly recommend it to all young people, to live a virtuous and religious life, as the reverſe brings on ſorrows and reflections not eaſily eraſed—The ſpring of life being gone, which thought is very oppreſſive to a feeling mind, at leaſt when not ſpent to that purpoſe for which the Great Author of our exiſtence deſigned it. It is certain, that in the time of youth, the greateſt comforts are to be enjoyed; for in general, health is ſhooting forth her blooms, which renders the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect before us pleaſing and entertaining; there is ſo great a field for improvement in the time of youth,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:027681_0004_0FD5DA08C63059C0"/>
that if properly cultivated, will lay in ſuch a rich harveſt, as will bring us on the great theatrical ſtage of life, up<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

I would never adviſe a perſon to marry altogether for fancy's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>conomical life, their affections will cement and reſt proximate together.</p>
            <p>After my marriage, my two brothers being ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled ſome diſtance from home, my father thought proper to continue me in his houſe, and being of a fretful diſpoſition, and growing old and his faculties failing, added to my afflictions: for let me do right or wrong, I was almoſt ſure of meeting with blame, although he was a tender hearted man, and the poor often experienced his benevolence. I would ever adviſe a new married pair, not to live under the ſame roof with their parents, (eſpecially farmers) as it frequently creates a diſcord, they having two ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate intereſts, generally ſpeaking. Thus I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued until the tenth day of November, 1775, when I engaged in the firſt Jerſey regiment, under Captain Andrew M'Myers, what was called a firſt ſerjeant, and I thought it a great office; however, a number of my acquaintances ſuſpected I would not continue in the ſervice; but being a whig, and all for liberty, I left home, which was by no means irreputable, as my father had a handſome eſtate, and plenty of aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>After recruiting ſome young men of good charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:027681_0005_0FD5DA1B0137C480"/>
we were quartered in the barracks in Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth-Town. We went that winter to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>empſtead Plains, on Long Iſland, to diſarm ſome inhabitants who it was reported were unfriendly to the common cauſe, under the command of General Heard, who brought the Middleſex militia with him, and our regiment, which was under Lord Stirling, made up about twelve hundred men, with which we boldly marched on; our martial appearance ſo ſtruck the poor inhabitants, that they came running in with their old ruſty firelocks and ſwords, ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not to have been fired off ſince the days of Oliver Cromwell. In a few days we made a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and returned back gallant and victorious, not having a man killed or wounded, only a brother ſerjeant of mine fainted away, on the Plains, from a report that ſome regulars, were in Hempſtead, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenching themſelves.</p>
            <p>In February our regiment was ordered to New-York, and began to fortify the town. In the ſame month I met with an old friend of mine, who had formerly been well acquainted at my father's houſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and had juſt received a captain's commiſſion from the New-York provincial congreſs; he ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited me to accept a commiſſion and go with him, which I had no objection to, as I had often to ſtand cap in hand to ſome officers whom I did not think my equals before they received their commiſſions and became men of conſequence; I therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately made application to Lord Stirling, who interceded with General Lee, then commander in chief, and on producing a warrant from the New-York Congreſs, obtained a diſcharge. I then pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed a ſword and became an officer. I went on recruiting rapidly, ſo that by the aſſiſtance of one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

bodied men, all quartered in Weſtfield, on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, at one dollar each man per week; ſo that I judge, in the whole monies expended, I loſt one hundred pounds, part of which I had to pay in hard money, after the cloſe of the war. In April we were ordered to New-York, and from thence to Stillwater, where we lay about ſix weeks, and then went to Ticonderoga. In June I had the command of ſome batteaux (by order of Colonel Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> ſuch a ſcene of mortality as was exhibited at that place, I never had beheld. The hoſpital I judged to be about one hundred and fifty feet in length; on the lower floor in two ranges on each ſide <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Their diſorder was chiefly the ſmall-pox—Some groaning and begging for water, ſome dying, and others dead and ſewed up in their blankets; let it ſuffice to ſay, that by the middle of the afternoon they would begin to carry the dead from the hoſpital: I counted twenty-one carried out at one time, and it was common to bury fifteen or twenty in a day. At Fort George the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order prevailed, with other epidemical diſeaſes, which were as fatal as at Crown Point. My me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory will not permit me to aſſert, but as near as I can recollect, it was judged that near ſix thouſand perſons died in that campaign, which was in the year 1776. In New-Jerſey that year, the mortality was great, although General Waſhington's army was more healthy.</p>

            <p>In July or Auguſt General Gates took the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand at Ticonderoga, and the mount on the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſide of the lake was fortified.

            <p>The ſame fall, an appointment of officers took place in the York line, and I received a lieutenant's commiſſion, under Col. G. Van Schaick, who order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me on the recruiting ſervice, at which, being a ſtranger in the ſtate of New-York, I thought to ſtand a better chance in Jerſey, where I was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, but found it impracticable to liſt any men in that quarter of the world, as General Howe, lay in Brunſwick, and General Waſhington, in Morris-Town. During my ſtay in Jerſey that winter, a great many ſkirmiſhes happened between the Britiſh and Americans, chiefly foraging parties. I was at a place called Hanover, where ſome of the Jerſey mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia lay, and an expreſs arrived with intelligence that a party of the enemy from New-York, were coming on to Morris-Town, which ſpread a general alarm; however, it turned out to be about three hundred priſoners, who were chiefly taken at Fort Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and had been confined in ſugar houſes, cold jails, &amp;c. The poor objects preſented a ſhocking view; for their appeared nothing in them but mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents of cruelty—emaciated with cold, hunger and poverty, being ſo feeble as ſcarcely to be able to ſupport their cold and benumbed limbs, and to be ſhort, their hardſhips had been ſo ſevere, that the major part of them died after returning home, in ſpight of every effort for their relief.

               </gap> the poor priſoners in New-York, were prohibited from giving them any relief. I remained in Jerſey until towards ſpring, when I joined my regiment at Fort George, and lay there until Ticonderoga was evacuated.</p>
            <p>Our army retreated by Skeenſborough to Fort Edward. We lay about fifteen days at Fort George after the evacuation, and then burnt four fine new brigs, which had been built for the defence of the lake, together with the barracks, and blew up the fort. We then marched to Kingſbury and encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near Fort Edward for a few days, having previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſent all our ſtores from Fort George to Fort Edward, even the cannon-balls, before we decamped.</p>
            <p>The ſecond day after we encamped at Kingſbury, a guard, about a mile from us, towards Fort Ann, was attacked by ſome Indians, who killed twelve of them. Our regiment was immediately ordered to march where the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ring was, and to the honor of our Lieutenant-Colonel (Vandyke) and the regiment, they were ſoon under a full march to the ſpot, where every one, in my opinion, expected we ſhould have an attack; but on our approach, the Indians fled. The men who were killed were all from New-England, fine, young, genteel perſons. A few days after, we retreated towards Fort Miller; the army was then under the command of General Schuyler. I am at a loſs exactly where we encamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but I judge about three miles from Fort Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The next morning, it being my tour to go on duty, I was ordered with a party of men to go about half way from camp to Fort Edward. Some jocular converſation happened between my good friend Licut. Tobias Van Vactor and myſelf; he
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:027681_0010_0FD5DA1290FAF838"/>
remarked that I was going forward to be a terror to the wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ds, &amp;c. After quitting camp about one mile, a heavy diſcharge of muſquetry was given juſt ahead, on which we mended our pace, and to our ſurpriſe, found ſix men and an officer expiring with their wounds, all being ſcalped. They were on their way to Fort Edward, where ſome of our troops then lay; and as they had gone without or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and a report ſpread in camp of the affair it was taken for granted that it was my party which was cut off, and that I was killed; it was mentioned at head quarters, by the Colonel of our regiment, that myſelf and party muſt have fallen. After view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the melancholy ſight, we proceeded a little fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and according to orders, ſecreted ourſelves in the woods until evening, when we returned to camp, to the no ſmall joy of our brother officers and ſoldiers.</p>
            <p>The next day, my friend Lieutenant Van Vactor, was on duty, and a party was to go to the heights beyond Fort Edward. The duty lay between him and another officer. Some propoſals were made to draw lots, but poor Tobias, ſcorning any thing which had the leaſt appearance of fear, chearfully ſet out with his guard; and in the ſame jocular way, in return to him, I remarked—"Now Tobias, ſurely the ſavages will tremble at your approach"—But I little thought on what I was ſaying; for the heights where he lay, about the middle of the afternoon, were attacked by the Indians, and being overpower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was himſelf killed and all his guard, except one man. The Indians then proceeded within gun ſhot of Fort Edward, and took the mother and daughter by the name of M'Crea (the young lady's chriſtian name was Jane) and carried them on the ſpot where the above bloody ſcene was tranſacted, and there
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:027681_0011_0FD5DA0F22A75E50"/>
murdered and ſcalped both mother and daughter. They ſtripped poor Van Vactor, and after ſcalping him, ſtabbed him in ſeveral places; they then faſtened a tomahawk in his breaſt, ſharpened a ſtick and erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him on his feet, by bracing the ſharp part of the ſtick under his chin, and left him a ſtanding monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their barbarity.</p>
            <p>Thus was my dear friend, who ventured his life in the cauſe of freedom and his country, treated! Good God! what a ſcene preſented! to meet him thus mangled, together with Miſs M'Crea, ſide and ſide in a horſe-cart! Melancholy thought! The theme is too mournful to dwell on.—After this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of cruelty, vengeance was ſworn againſt the Indians, which I am of opinion was of advantage, as they never acted with that boldneſs afterwards. The death of Miſs Jane M'Crea, ſpread a general alarm, particularly through the New-England ſtates, and I believe drove many to arms, who before ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to appear in ſuſpence. Her death alſo made ſome diſturbance amongſt the Britiſh; for it was reported ſhe was waiting at Fort Edward, for the Britiſh ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to come forward, as a Mr. Jones, was in ſaid ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to whom ſhe was ſhortly to be married. The next day I was a pall-bearer to aſſiſt in conveying my good friend to his laſt retreat, which could not be done with dry eyes; he was buried with the honors of war. Miſs M'Crea was alſo buried in the ſame grave with him. The two harmleſs monitors lay ſilent as the night, not an intervening cloud to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb their repoſe. Lie there hapleſs pair, and as your reſt appears cordial together under the cold clods, may your better part be triumphing in that haven, where all ſorrows are wiped away, and but one continued repoſe, will be your everlaſting bliſs.

            <p>Mr. Van Vactor was born and brought up in Brunſwick, in New-Jerſey, but had lived ſome time with General Schuyler, in a reputable office and character.</p>
            <p>This ſcene puts me further in mind of a piece of poetry I read on the tomb of two Pennſylvania of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, who were killed and ſcalped at Crown-Point, unarmed:</p>
            <l>Brave ſons of America, lie quiet here,</l>

            <l>And tremble Europe, ſons of ſavage race,</l>
            <l>Death and revenge, awaits you with diſgrace.</l>
            <p>The officer who was killed going to Fort Edward without arms or orders, belonged to the New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland line. The day we decamped from the ground where Van Vactor was buried, the Britiſh took poſſeſſion of Fort Edward. We marched to the heights oppoſite Col. M'Crea's, and lay for a few days. The morning our regiment left that place, it was my tour to go on duty as far as our laſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping

ground, and on my arrival, General Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold, with a number of militia was on the oppoſite ſide of the north river; the General ordered me to croſs the river, which I did on a raft of boards, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Enſign with the party, and was informed ſome Britiſh and Indians had a few minutes before parted from a houſe within ſmall gun-ſhot of where we then were, on that ſide of the river. And, after receiving ſome orders from the General, returned with the party (conſiſting of about thirty men) with precaution, as we had to march ſome diſtance thro' the woods, within about two miles of five hundred Indians, and a number of Burgoyne's army. On our arrival on the ground, the army had marched to Fort Miller; however, we overtook them, as the graſs did not grow under our feet. The mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia aforementioned whom we left on the oppoſite ſide of the river, appeared in high ſpirits, and were careleſsly walking about, as the land was clear and they apparently out of danger. Some Indians ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in about half an hour after our departure, the ſame ſide we were on; the militia fired and whooped at them through deriſion, but about thirty of their moſt expert warriors croſſed the river, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceived, and by the aſſiſtance of ſtumps, &amp;c. got oppoſite the militia before they diſcovered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; they then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ired and gave the war whoop, which ſo frightened the militia, that without firing a gun, every man took to his heels promiſcuouſly for near two miles; the Indians followed in cloſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit and killed a number of men; but being met by the brave Capt. John Graham and ſome volunteer troops from General Pomeroy's brigade, with a field piece, a check was given the Indians, and in turn our people planted ſeveral of them. If I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not, General Arnold's aid-de-camp, as a volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer,

was wounded in the neck. The reaſon why I make uſe of the term volunteer, is—that it being impoſſible to put the whole army, or even a large command, on ſo ſudden an emergency, in motion, with that expedition which appeared neceſſary, a few therefore voluntarily aſſembled to make an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate advance. My party at the ſame time had not reached the main body, although we had a fair view of part of the militia's retreat; but the river being impaſſable and our number ſo ſmall, that we ſuppoſed any attempt in vain, as we were unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the number of the enemy. I do not think that General Arnold had any command of the militia, but himſelf and aid were on a reconnoitering <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="17" facs="unknown:027681_0015_0FD5DA0505C96648"/>
braſs pieces of artillery, were ordered for the relief of the garriſon, under the command of General Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold. The artillery was commanded by Captain Dunbar, and Lieutenants Driſkel, and Kemper. Accordingly, about the middle of the afternoon, we marched, and by a hard route on the third day ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the German Flats, oppoſite what was called Shoemaker's, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>here we heard almoſt a conſtant fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring. A young man, I think by the name of Schuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, who held a commiſſion in the Britiſh ſervice, had come to the Flats where he was acquainted, to perſuade the people from their allegiance to the ſtates, particularly ſo, after the ſad overthrow of ſo large a number of the militia, who were inhabitants of that county, under General Herkimer; but it appeared the people ſtood firm, although it might be ſaid their place was invaded; they were certainly in great danger, but were ſtill ſo determined as to make Schuyler a priſoner; he was tried by a court-martial of the officers under Arnold's command, and condemned to be hanged as a ſpy; a gallows was accordingly erected for that purpoſe. Arnold how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, concluded to grant him a reprieve, on condition that he would leave an hoſtage behind to hang in his place, if he did not perform the buſineſs he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſend him on, with punctuality, and return: otherwiſe, if an hoſtage was produced, and a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliance on Schuyler's part, the hoſtage ſhould die in his ſtead. A man appeared and entered into Schuyler's place, on which General Arnold gave Schuyler the following directions—"That he the ſaid Schuyler, ſhould go immediately to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the Britiſh, lying before Fort Stanwix, and inform him, that he the ſaid Arnold, had under his immediate command, thirteen hundred well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined troops, with a good train of artillery, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:027681_0016_0FD5DA01F3934710"/>
that if he did not, without delay, raze the ſiege, they might expect he would march his army and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> them off, or make priſoners of the whole"—wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> Schuyler performed with punctuality, and returned the next day with intelligence that the Britiſh, on hearing the report, had razed the ſiege and gone off, which was authenticated by an expreſs from the ſaid fort. Schuyler was ſent to Albany and the army put under marching orders.—I am not certain that the above are the words of Arnold's orders to Schuyler, but are to the purport, as far as I could learn.</p>
            <p>During the ſiege at Fort Stanwix, General Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kimer, as I before mentioned, met with an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw. Having embodied the major part <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the beſt inhabitants of that county (amounting to about ſeven hundred men) into a brigade, in order to go to the relief of the ſaid fort, they were met on their march by the Indians, who totally defeated them; four hundred men or more were killed in the action, ſuppoſed to be through miſconduct, as part of the militia ran away in the firſt onſet: thoſe who ſtood were almoſt to a man cut off. The General received a wound in his leg, which was amputated; but it being warm weather, and he a corpulent man, died of the wound.</p>
            <p>The battle happened about eight days before our arrival, and after we marched for the ſort. Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſiege was razed, we left our artillery in order to make what force we could, expecting to come up with the rear of the enemy; we had to march over the ground where Herkimer's battle was fought, and as the dead had not been buried, and the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther warm, they were much ſwoln and of a purple colour, which repreſented the frailty of man in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry figurative ſenſe; we muſt have marched over and very near, about four hundred dead bodies; which
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:027681_0017_0FD5DA0667EA5A70"/>
brought on this reflection—to what a pitch of vanity muſt they arrive, who are ſo doatingly fond of the lump of clay which they poſſeſs; as it is daily ſubject to putrifaction and decay.</p>
            <p>We continued our march, without any moleſtation, until our arrival at the fort, where we congratulated the old beſieged officers and ſoldiers with joy for their being relieved. The next morning, about five hundred men were ſent down Wood Creek after the enemy, but they had gone off.</p>
            <p>General Arnold and the New-England troops continued a few days at the garriſon and then march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down to join the main army, at Stillwater, leaving our regiment at the Fort, not knowing but the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh might again return to the ſiege.

            <p>General Waſhington's army met with a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able loſs that campaign, at the Brandywine; but hutted themſelves very ſnugly the winter following, at a place called Valley Forge, whilſt General Howe lay in Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>We marched from Schenectady to Albany, where the main body of General Gates's army in a few days arrived, having ſent Burgoyne's troops, who ſurrendered on the 15th of October, to Boſton.—Our army lay about two or three weeks, and then marched from Albany to join General Waſhington, except the regiment to which I belonged. The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, from information, had a tedious, rainy, cold march, as it muſt have been ſome time in Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber before they arrived at their cantonments, and had then to hut themſelves; but a braver ſet of troops perhaps never exiſted.</p>
            <p>Our regiment lay a few weeks after the army had marched to the ſouthward, and then returned to Schenectady, where we were quartered all winter, although ſome troops continued in Albany.</p>

Suſſex, Eaſt-Town, and ſo to Valley Forge, where we arrived about the middle of the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, but I am not certain as to the day of the month; we were ordered to proceed on to a place, near the Blue-Ball eighteen miles from Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, and were quartered in houſes, where we lived comfortably, amongſt a ſociable ſet of inhabitants, until July; when orders were received for us to join the main army, to proceed after the Britiſh who had evacuated Philadelphia, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Sir Henry Clinton. We purſued them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til we came near Princeton; a draught was made to form a light infantry, to be commanded by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lee, and it being my tour of duty, it fell to my lot to go into the ſaid infantry; and accordingly, having twenty-two men of my choice from our regiment, joined them. The next day we arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at Engliſh-Town, near Monmouth Court-Houſe, within little more than a mile of the out wing of the Britiſh army; our regiment was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Colonel Richard Butler, Lieutenant Colonel Harmer, and Major Benjamin Ledyard, who was a Major in the regiment to which I belonged; the other gentlemen were of the Pennſylvania line. About break of day on the 28th, we were all under arms, and a little after ſunriſe came oppoſite to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth Court-Houſe on the left, having paſſed thro' woods where ſome of the Britiſh had that night en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped. However, previouſly to our proceeding ſo far, General Lee joined us with the main body of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, and the whole being formed into ſections four deep, made a grand and extenſive appearance; it was not eaſy to determine our number particularly: a foot officer cannot form a judgment with as much preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as an officer on horſeback; but if I miſtake not, the calculation was at leaſt five thouſand men. On
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:027681_0020_0FD5DA36EA769718"/>
our front appearing oppoſite the enemy, who were marching on the main road; it apparently ſtruck them with conſternation; was the rear of their army, where were a number of waggons, &amp;c. On our firſt approach, we received a few ſhot from their muſquetry on the right in the fields. We continued our march to the heights on the left of the court-houſe, and halted in a piece of woods; Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Wayne being forward, I heard him give orders to a horſeman, to inform General Lee of the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Britiſh were in, and that a fairer proſpect of attacking them with ſucceſs, never could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited! but to our aſtoniſhment, General Lee, had wheeled the whole of the infantry off to the right, except our regiment, and came on the rear of the enemy; but we, not knowing Lee's manoeuvres, marched down into the fields. Our dragoons, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 50 in number, were forward, and appeared to form ſome diſtance on the right of our regiment, on which the Britiſh made a charge on them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing overpowered by numbers, they retreated; our regiment ſupported them, and the Britiſh in turn were forced to give way, leaving two horſes ſhot dead. We retreated into the edge of a wood, where we ſuſtained a cannonade from their artillery for nearly an hour, during which time the Britiſh were manoeuvring to form all their force together, in order to advance for battle. At length, a ſtrong party appeared in order to attack us, which our of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers perceiving, and finding the whole army was in motion, we retreated on the right of where Lee was; but, in fact, we had marched near two miles before we diſcovered him; he was then making a ſtand, but on the approach of the enemy (their dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons being in front and making a charge) our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry immediately retreated, by order of General
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:027681_0021_0FD5DA2E289E25C8"/>
Lee, as was ſaid, and it is a matter I do not doubt, as the army continued to retreat until the Britiſh came fairly in ſight of our main army, commanded by General Waſhington.—I mentioned that our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment was on the right flank, ſome conſiderable diſtance from Lee; indeed we were the whole re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat oppoſite the main Britiſh army; and on their making a halt, we alſo halted, about half a mile from them, in an orchard, when a party of Britiſh about equal to our number, advanced within muſkes ſhot of us, and a firing commenced on both ſides, in the open field (except a few apple-trees.) One cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which took place in the action, I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:—A certain William Orr, who was a corporal in the firſt York regiment, appeared to be fitting down, and I, ſuppoſing he was wounded, went to him and aſked what was the matter; he told me nothing;—that he was only fixing his gun, on which he immediately fired; and as near as I could tell, the ball firſt ſtruck the ground, and by bouncing, killed an officer who was ſtanding a ſmall diſtance from a large old trunk of a tree, as at that very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant the officer fell. It was judged that we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in the field, and ſuſtained a conſtant fire, for about fifteen or twenty minutes, when Colonel Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber came and ſaid, it was the commander in chief's orders, that we ſhould retreat. At this time, if I miſtake not, the Colonel, on his return to the main army, received a fleſh wound. We were ordered to go and take refreſhment, on which we marched about two miles in the rear of the army, the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing exceſſive hot, and having loſt a number of men; out of three hundred and ſixty, we did not march more than one hundred and ſixty to camp, but num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers returned the next day, having been ſo overpow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with the heat, as to ſink under the fatigue.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:027681_0022_0FD5DA4A2A2323D0"/>
The party of the Britiſh with which we were enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, could not have been the troops who were firſt ſent to attack us, as this party appeared to be detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their main army, and were approaching us when we halted, and what became of thoſe in our rear, I never could learn.</p>
            <p>I remarked in a former part of this memoir, that the Britiſh appeared to be ſtruck with conſternation; and thoſe ſentiments are ſtill retained, as I imagine they were not aware of our army's being ſo near them, particularly in ſo early a part of the day; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I believe they thought we would not attack them at all: but had we engaged them with the whole of our infantry at our firſt approach, I am of opinion, nor can it be reverſed, that we might have taken a large body of the rear of their army; and at that time my judgment was not alone. As to Lee, I can ſay by him as Michael did to the devil—"that he would bring no railing accuſation againſt him, but the Lord rebuke thee:" ſo I will not rail againſt the conduct of Lee, but if he has any conſcience, let him feel the rebuke of his country.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon, on the ſame day, the New-York brigade, and ſome of the New-England troops, were ordered to march and make an attack on a party who had advanced on the right wing of the main army, nearly on the ſame ſpot where we had been in the morning's ſkirmiſh, where it was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a general battle would be brought on; but it did not happen, although the American troops had certainly the better of the ground; a number fell on both ſides, particularly the Britiſh. My reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able friend Colonel Van Schaick, I underſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved with calmneſs and true courage during the action, as well as the officers in general of the York. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>; indeed the whole diviſion received the thanks
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:027681_0023_0FD5DA4A2617DC90"/>
of the commander in chief, for their good conduct. That night we lay on our arms, expecting the next morning to have a general battle, but the Britiſh had retreated from the ground in the dead of night, and left their killed on the field; the next day or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were given to bury them, and it was a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſpectacle, to ſee ſo many dead bodies lay ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the elements, and the exceſſive heat added to the ſight. We judged the Britiſh loſt about five hundred men, and our army ſomewhere between three and four hundred. There is no doubt with me, from the beſt information I could obtain, that had not the Britiſh retreated that night, the next day a general battle between the two main armies would have been inevitable, and the conſequence, on one ſide or the other (and perhaps on both) would undoubtedly have proved very ſerious. Thus much may be ſaid, that our main army lay in ſight of the Britiſh for about two thirds of the day, and ſupported a heavy cannonade from their artillery, during which time the balls, &amp;c. were continually ſcreaming in the air, and ſtriking amongſt them, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the almoſt intolerable heat of the day; all which they appeared to ſupport with undaunted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and true courage. Our artillery in turn was ſo well ſerved on them, that the Britiſh condeſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſay, that in time they would become equal to veteran troops: but my opinion is, that a better ſet of artillerymen never went into a field, than what America could that day boaſt of. In fact the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican army, generally ſpeaking, gained the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fading laurels. This account of the battle of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, may prove very imperfect to a critical eye; but as it is only written for amuſement, and on the ſtrength of memory, after the term of five years has elapſed, thoſe who are better acquainted with the facts herein related, will, I truſt, excuſe me.</p>

               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:027681_0024_0FD5DA1F760CCEA8"/>
After the battle, the army was put under march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing orders, and in two days arrived on the heights, above the town of Brunſwick. Our regiment en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped on the eaſt ſide of the Raritan river, the light infantry having again reverted to the ſeveral regiments to which they before belonged.</p>
            <p>On the fourth day of July, being the ſecond an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſary of our independence, a ſue-de-joye was diſplayed by the army, it being formed in two lines on the ſouth ſide of the river, on the heights oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite the bridge, and having the artillery placed with the ſeveral brigades, a running fire began from the right to the left, and ſo on, through the two lines. My health on that day being ſomewhat impaired, I did not join the army, but was a ſpectator on the oppoſite ſide of the river. The regularity of the firings, as an eaſy and ſteady running fire of muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ketry, and a diſcharge of the artillery of each bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade at the inſtant the muſketry on their line ceaſed, together with a continued flame and ſmoke, added to the grandeur of the proſpect, and beſpoke the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a warlike people, contending for true liberty—What horrid engines of death appeared!—as if Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> Etna was vomiting forth from her volcanoes, fire and ſmoke. Surely, ſaid I, this is all through the pride and ambition of a few aſpiring mortals.</p>
            <p>From Brunſwick, the army moved by diviſions through Jerſey, to Dobbs's Ferry, where they croſſed the North River, and paſſed on to the White Plains. By general orders, a draft was again made to form a light infantry brigade, which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by General Scott; old Doctor Skinner, was our head Surgeon, both of whom would now and then ſwear a word. Capt. John Graham, Lieut. Charles Perſon, and myſelf, were drafted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and we
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:027681_0025_0FD5DA3FD5987528"/>
joined Colonel Richard Butler's regiment. We marched down towards Kingſbridge, to a place call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tuckehowe, and were ſtationed in that part of the country to watch the motions of the Britiſh, who had arrived at New-York. They kept a ſtrong garriſon at Kingſbridge, and were often out into the country foraging, or marauding. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands from our infantry were every day or two or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered out to watch the motions of the enemy, and guards were alſo kept out ſome diſtance from our encampment, which made the infantry duty pretty hard. I think it was in September, when a party was ſent out towards Kingſbridge, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Major Stewart; we proceeded within one mile of the fort, when we were ſuddenly fired on by the Britiſh, they being in the woods and our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in a long open field; it appeared the enemy were almoſt round us before they began to fire. Major Stewart, with a few men, were on horſeback; and although he never was called a coward, yet he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his horſe with what dragoons were with him, and left us in the open field to ſhift for ourſelves. There was a captain by the name of Odale, a Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Williams, from Col. Graham's regiment of nine months or three years men, but am not certain, and if I miſtake not, Lieutenant John Hardenbergh—however, there were no more officers except my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and I think about forty-five or fifty privates. We were immediately charged on by a body of Britiſh dragoons, but every ſoldier ſtood his ground; and after the horſe had fired on us with their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, they retreated to load and charge on the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty again. We had at that time ſome Stockbridge Indians in our army, and if they had riſen out of the ground they could not have appeared more unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. The head warrior came foremoſt, calling
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:027681_0026_0FD5DA5ECDF52E60"/>
us cowards, becauſe we did not purſue the horſe when they retreated; they being intoxicated with liquor, all arguments proved ineffectual; the horſe made another charge, and then retreated, which the Indians perceiving, ran whooping and bellowing after them. Capt. Odale thought it beſt to march a party forward in order to ſupport the Indians, and accordingly took I think ſixteen men; but the foot appearing to be marching in the ſame direction to aſſiſt the horſe, they gave one more charge; on which the Indians took to their heels, and the field being very long the horſe came up with them, and orders were given by the officer who commanded the dragoons, to give no quarters to the copper-heads, which was put in force, as they killed every one, except three, who were in the party, and moſt inhumanly too. Poor Odale and his party were ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoners; but the reſt of us made our eſcape through a cornfield.</p>
            <p>In a few weeks after, a conſiderable party of what was called Ya<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gers, were out on their old trade, and our people falling in with them, killed and took eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man. They were chiefly of the Heſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ian dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons. I was not in the party, and of conſequence got no ſhare of the prize; although I made a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of one of the horſes, ſaddle and bridle, that were taken; and to be ſure, when I was mounted on my beaſt that was near ſixteen hands high, with my Dutch ſaddle, I muſt have cut a figure. The ſaddle was compoſed of two pieces of wood in the form of a half moon, the back part reſting on the horſe, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by a pad and ſheep-ſkin, and the top covered by a ſheep-ſkin in the ſame manner; ſo that when mounted, it was not eaſy to retreat from the ſeat, as a bowſprit appeared not only in the bow, but alſo in the ſtern, and the bridle weighed at leaſt twelv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

pounds. Thus we went on from pillar to poſt, and from poſt to pillar, until the latter end of November, when our regiment was ordered to go to Fort Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wix; of conſequence, the York troops had to join their regiment which then lay at Peeks-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ill, and from thence began our march and proceeded on to Fiſh-Kill, and in time arrived at Albany.</p>
            <p>An anecdote occurs to my mind. On our paſſage up the North river, we came to anchor not far from Claverack, and a number of officers, among whom I recollect were Lieut. Perſon, and James Bingham, and ſome others whoſe names I have forgotten; however, we all went on ſhore, and walked near or quite two miles into the country, to a public houſe, to refreſh ourſelves with ſupper, &amp;c. and I think not a perſon had his ſide arms or any kind of weapon of defence; but being in our diſhabille on board, went ſo on ſhore, or at leaſt we had not our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimentals. Upon our arrival at the Inn, we aſked for ſomething to drink; the landlord pretended he had nothing but ſower cider, which we took for granted, and called for ſome, and ſower enough it was; indeed it was ſo bad we could not drink it. We then aſked if he could mull ſome of it in eggs (uſing their phraſe.) Why yes, he believed he could; but appeared to do it with reluctance, and when it came, it was curdled, and to make ſhort, we could not drink it. We had called for victuals, but received very ſurly anſwers—that there was no proviſion in the houſe, and ſo on. At length the houſe was ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with armed men, and a Captain of the militia came in and enquired very ſtrictly where we came from, and which way we were bound. We were at a loſs what conſtruction to put on ſuch queſtions, but final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told them the regiment we bel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ged to, and which way we were bound, but found great difficulty in
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:027681_0028_0FD5DA312A30B478"/>
making them believe us; and, if I miſtake not, they would put no confidence in what we ſaid, until they had ſent down and ſeen the ſloop, &amp;c. However, after they found us out, the Captain addreſſed us in the following manner—"Well gentlemen, as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you be, for I am now convinced; you ſee here is my neighbour landlord, and I ſuppoſed he would not give you any thing to eat or drink, and he his not to blame, let you think what you will; for you know, neighbours, (for I muſt now call you ſo) that a number of vagrants are running through the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try pillaging, and what not; and then they run down to the Britiſh, or ſomewhere elſe, and we were not certain but you were of that kind of people, as our neighbour landlord, ſent me word as ſoon as you came to his houſe, as how a party was there, and was diſtruſtful; and therefore we came to ſee who you were, and which away, and ſo on. Why you have no regimentals, you have no ſwords, no bayo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, nor them long ſticks with ſharp iron on the end, I forgot what they are called." We told him, we ſuppoſed he meant eſpontoons—"Ay, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> eſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toons. Well, well, landlord, I believe the men are honeſt, let them have what they want." On which our generous landlord produced good liquors and an excellent ſupper. We took care how we ventured on ſhore again without our ſide arms, at leaſt.</p>
            <p>We continued a ſhort time in Albany, and then marched to Schenectady. Our baggage was put in batteaus to go up the Mohawk river. On our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at Fort Johnſon we received the news that Cherry Valley was beſieged, which occaſioned our regiment to march early the next morning; and on our arrival at Colonel Clock's an expreſs came with information that the enemy had retreated. We continued on, as the weather was very cold (it
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:027681_0029_0FD5DA5323ED53A0"/>
being ſome time in the middle of December) ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſmall ſnows fell during our march; but finally we arrived at the garriſon, not far from Chriſtmaſs, where we were welcomed by Colonel Ganſevoort's officers, who, poor fellows, had been for a long time pent up in that garriſon. The next day they marched for Albany, (a diſtance of one hundred miles, a conſiderable part of which was through the woods)—We had not been long at Fort Stanwix, before our friendly Indians made application to have a fort picquetted in their town for them, as a defence againſt the Indians, who adhered to the crown of G. Britain; and the requeſt was thought ſo reaſonable that a party of about forty men under the command of Captain John Wendell, Lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Van Valkenburgh and myſelf, were ſent to the Oneida caſtle. Our Lieutenant Colonel (Van-Dyke,) and my Lord Hanſon; our iſſuing commiſſary for the garriſon, accompanied us, and the next e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening we had a grand ball or dance. I had never fairly ſeen one of their dances before, only a ſmall ſketch at Skeenſborough, and was ſo elevated that I became an aſſiſtant in their muſic; but I had to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend my pipes ſo high, and now and then being plyed with a glaſs of rum, (which I thought the Colonel or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered the oftener, to fix me) I finally grew fatigued with my birth, and ſuddenly made my eſcape; two Indians followed to catch me, in order to return to the dance, but had not the good fortune to find me out that night. For a deſcription of their method of dancing, I ſhall refer to where I was a priſoner among them.</p>
            <p>The next day all hands went to work, ſome one way and ſome another, in order to erect our fort. It was the ſoldiers' duty to break the ground and dig the trenches for the piquets, which was done by
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:027681_0030_0FD5DA8CDC616D38"/>
giving every ſoldier his taſk, and that was, to cut twelve feet each man a day, two feet deep; and having ſo many hands, we made faſt work, although the ſnow and froſt were very deep. The Indians drew the logs for picquets, and old Daniel Tucker laid out the fort; and ſuch another I gueſs was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeen; but be it as it will, it had ſeveral corners ſomething in form of Baſtions. In one corner the Indians would cut a man's face on the picquets, which denoted one thing, the other corner another, and ſo on; one was good news, another was bad news; and one was this name, and the other that; they called me <hi>Carrawhaxet,</hi> that is, <hi>Bad News;</hi> I have forgot the names given to the Captain and Van Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenburgh. We continued there about two weeks, when we were relieved by Captain John Copp, and returned to the garriſon. As this fort buſineſs is of ſuch conſequence, I muſt not forget to mention, that one corner was called Congreſs, another General Waſhington, but Lee, I believe was left out. The winter was paſſed with a good degree of harmony in our quarters; we were ſo induſtrious as to cut and draw our own fire-wood for the garriſon, at leaſt the ſoldiers did it for us.

            <p>In the latter end of March I was ordered on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs to Fort Herkimer; but it being in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon when I left home, and having to ride thirty miles, night came on before I could croſs the river, at what was called Oriſka, and a heavy ſnow ſtorm commencing, I had to ſtay the whole night in the woods alone, without either fire or covering, except the canopy of Heaven, amid the ſolemn ſhades of a dark and beating ſtorm, expoſed to wild beaſts, and

worſe than all, the ſavages were frequently making incurſions on the courſe I was ordered, which added not a little to the gloom of my ſituation. The day appearing, I purſued my journey, and ſwam my horſe acroſs the Mohawk at Shoemaker's; I rode on that ſide of the river to the fort, where I was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> acroſs by a boat from the garriſon. In the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon I returned to Oriſka, and tarried all night at an old Dutchman's houſe; the man was from home, and the old lady ſpoke but very little Engliſh. She aſked me if I could ſpeak Dutch; I told her (in Dutch) a little, which was all the Dutch I could produce from my ſkill in that language, and I got ſadly paid for it: for all the Engliſh eloquence I was maſter of, would not convince her but I could talk Dutch; and ſhe was ſo offended, that I went to bed ſupperleſs. The morning being clear and cold, I aroſe by break of day, and gave a boy a dollar to go with me to the river, as he ſaid there was a canoe in which I could croſs myſelf, and ſwim my horſe; but on coming to the river, the canoe was gone.

hard as ice could make them. I travelled a rough road, in that ſituation, until I arrived, and ſhall ever think that I took ſuch a cold on the occaſion, that I never recovered until my return from captivity. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this time, ſome troops arrived at our garriſon, but their intention was unknown. If I miſtake not, they were part of Colonel Ganſev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ort's regiment, and one or two rifle companies. The Indians ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very inquiſitive to know the meaning of their arrival, and was anſwered—'to reinforce and make an addition to the fort'—which the Oneidas appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pacified with.</p>
            <p>On the night of the 16th of April, ſome batteaus were croſſed from the Mohawk river to Wood Creek ſo privately, that ſcarcely any one in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, except the guards, knew any thing of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair; but, previous to the movement of the boats, every officer and private received orders to hold themſelves in readineſs to go on command. Some time before day, the garriſon troops and thoſe who joined them, conſiſting of about five hundred men, were under way to Wood Creek: the baggage was put on board the boats, and the main body marched to the Oneida lake, a party being left, ſufficient to manage the boats; I was with them; we arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the lake and took refreſhment about day-light-in, and then the whole of the troops embarked on board the boats, and made their way on the lake. About ten o'clock, we arrived at an iſland oppoſite Fort Brewington, at the mouth, being the furtheſt end of the lake, which is computed to be thirty-ſix miles in length. The party was immediately put on ſhore, and under way for the Onondaga town, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Colonel Van Schaick of the 1ſt New-York regiment, and Lieut. Col. Willett, of the 2d New-York regiment; Major Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hran was the other
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:027681_0033_0FD5DA51996B08C8"/>
field officer. I was ordered to ſtay and take the command of the boats. The party proceeded and lay on their arms that night; the next morning, by ten o'clock, they ſurrounded and took a number of priſoners, and brought them off, with ſome valuable trinkets which belonged to the Indians; they burnt their town, deſtroyed their corn, and what they met in their way of cattle, grain, &amp;c. They returned the day following to the boats, when we all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked, croſſed the lake, and the next day arrived at our garriſon.</p>
            <p>I would here remark—that this expedition was conducted with ſuch ſecrecy and judgment, that an inſtance of the kind was not common, and received the thanks of the commander in chief.</p>
            <p>Nothing material happened from that time (except that ſerjeant Bogert and ſome privates, were taken pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners by the Indians on the 4th of June,) until the fatal 23d of July, 1779. It was my tour to go on command, as a guard to a party of men who were making hay, in the meadow about half a mile below the fort. The ground on which the men were at work, was a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row ſtrip, having the woods on one ſide, and the Mohawk river on the other, and extended about one mile in length; the party under my command, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of one ſerjeant, one corporal and twenty-eight privates. We ſaw that morning over the Mohawk river, an uncommon ſmoke, and the centinels at the fort, ſaid they had ſeen ſome Indian dogs, which was not common: however, therein I believe they were miſtaken; for the Indians never take dogs with them to war, or, at leaſt, I never heard of it: ſtill I had a ſuſpicion that an enemy was near, and expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſentiments to Captain John Graham. We left the fort by ſun-riſe in the morning, and march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within about one hundred yards of where the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:027681_0034_0FD5DAA0F71699A0"/>
guard had lain the day before. It had been a rule to ſend fourteen of the guard as centinels along the woods; and although I thought at that time it was improper, I dare not break the rules which had been eſtabliſhed, of conſequence the centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels were placed, with orders (in caſe of an alarm) to make immediately for the party. There were ſtill ſome hillocks of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ortification at the landing place, which had been put up the laſt French war, and the party were ordered if attacked, to all make for that place firſt; but no ſooner were the centinels placed, than the Indians laying then in ambuſh, immediately ruſhed on them and took every man, and fired on us; the party received orders not to diſcharge their pieces, but we had a mulatto fellow who ſtarted to run, and on being ordered to his ranks, returned and fired into the woods, and the whole guard fired likewiſe; on which the Indians made their appearance in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ield. We were only muſket ſhot from the woods, and their number amounted to three hundred and ſixty Indians; the guard in ſpite of any further ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort endeavored promiſcuouſly to make their eſcape, but were every man taken:—and in fact, to ſee ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſavages appear ruſhing on towards us almoſt naked, and painted up with their warlike figures, with ſuch engines of death in their hands, and whooping and yelling like ſo many infernal fiends, muſt make the ſtouteſt heart that ever exiſted, quake with ſear; in particular, when there appears no kind of relief. After all of us were taken, we were led from the meadow, and the Indians received ſeveral ſhot from the cannon of the fort. Captain Graham, came out with a ſtrong party from the garriſon for our relief, but it was all in vain; indeed the garriſon uſed their utmoſt endeavors to re-take us again; but I am of opinion, had any of the Indians been killed, the whole
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:027681_0035_0FD5DAB176C5DDA8"/>
of the priſoners would have been immediately put to death. I will further remark, that had we have had our bayonets (which for ſome reaſon were not with the guard) and all of us been in one body and not diſcharged our pieces, the Indians would have never entered in the open field againſt us.</p>
            <p>We were immediately taken beyond the ſluice, at an old fort which had been built laſt French war, called Newport, where poor old Monday, a ſoldier, being wounded, was immediately tomahawked and ſcalped. The Indians then had five ſcalps, but I never could find out what men were killed, except the one juſt mentioned. We were then ſtripped, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a ſhirt and ſmall-clothes; my ſword and chain with my hat were taken from me by the Indian who took me firſt; but as to my other clothes, boots, &amp;c. they were taken from me ſo ſuddenly, that I did not know who had them. The weather was ſo extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly warm, I could never have undergone the march, had not my clothes been taken from me. We after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards had all our arms pinioned, and a tump line, or ſlat braided ſtring, put round our necks; I received from a Mr. Larama, a Frenchman, with the rank of a Lieutenant in the Britiſh ſervice, a cap and pair of mockiſons; ſeveral of the priſoners received mock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſons from Mr. Larama, who was a kind tender heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man. When the priſoners were ordered to march, they conſiſted of one lieutenant, two ſerjeants, one corporal and twenty-eight privates, in all thirty-two, as the mowing party was alſo taken. We ſuddenly heard a heavy firing in our rear, which I took to be our party from the fort, and then expected inſtant death, which feelings are ſo awful, that language is inadequate to expreſs them; but when reflecting on the torture which I expected we muſt all undergo (as I had no other thought left, but of being burnt and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:027681_0036_0FD5DA96B702E6A8"/>
tortured to death in the manner the Indians general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do) I muſt confeſs I felt a calm reſignation to the fatal ſtroke; but the ſkirmiſh proved by Mr. Larama's account, to have been our Indians, and the party who took us, making a ſham-fight, as the Indians from the fort, pretended they muſt fight, or our great people, the rebels, would blame them, and then gave a whoop, pretending the enemy were too ſtrong for them, and ran off to the garriſon. Our arms be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all pinioned, we ſtarted, and went on a trot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtep to the Pine Ridge, where we made a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> minutes halt, it being about ten miles; we then turned off to the right, and went, as I judge, a north northweſt courſe, until about twelve o'clock, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very faſt; as it is cuſtomary for Indians when they take priſoners, to run with them for a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſtance, pretending the enemy may follow them; although I am perſuaded they were under no ſuch apprehenſions on this occaſion. After we halted, I was offered ſome parched corn, pounded coarſe and put in water; but being very unwel with a billious complaint, which had been on me from the time the Onondagas were cut off, I could not eat; nor had I, for a long time before, lived on any thing but boiled milk in ſpikenard, with a trifle of bread; any food of a coarſe nature, was like embers in my bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. The Indians took ſeveral horſes from the fort, and had them with them. We reſted about one hour, and then purſued our march very faſt. The weather was warm and ſuffocating, particularly in our ſituation, being confined with a large number of Indians in the woods, which rendered the air more condenſed than uſual: I was almoſt faint unto death. We marched until ſun-down, and by Mr. Larama's account, were forty miles from Fort Stanwix. They made fires and cooked ſome wheat meal, and a few
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:027681_0037_0FD5DA9E5EB4F258"/>
ſmall pieces of pork boiled up in water, and made not unpalatable ſoup, with a few cakes baked, which the priſoners each had a ſmall ſhare of. After ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, one of the chiefs aroſe, and made a lengthy ſpeech, during which I felt very uneaſy, as I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, after he had finiſhed, the torture on the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners would commence; but to my inexpreſſible joy, for that time, Mr. Larama told me that the purport of his ſpeech was, to divide the priſoners a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the different nations, which he was in hopes would not maſſacre us. The party conſiſted of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſedagoes, Mohawks, Tauwaus, Caughnawagoes, Jebowees, and Tuſkaroras; two Canadians and a white woman were with the Indians, beſides Mr. Larama. I fell to a chief of the Conoſedago nation; and on being delivered to my maſter, he gave three long whoops, ſeemingly with a mournful tone, and in an inſtant, a diſmal yell, which the whole joined in. At this time in their ceremonies, I was informed that death or mercy was the event; and, as they had concluded on mercy (which I was ignorant of) joy rebounded through the camp. Good God! what a ſcene was this to withſtand!—No language can expreſs, no eloquence can paint, no tongue can utter, what horrid ideas muſt impreſs the mind at ſo awful a criſis—the thought of being bound in thongs, and put to death by inches, is terrible beyond all imagination. The whole of the priſoners were handed to their different maſters in the ſame manner that I was, by giving three long and mournful whoops, and then three loud yells; and after they had finiſhed dividing the priſoners, they gave three long, loud, diſtinct yells, which, by Mr. Larama's information, was a token of mercy.</p>
            <p>After they had done, I deſired Mr. Larama to aſk permiſſion, in my name, for me to addreſs them
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:027681_0038_0FD5DABE2DB93728"/>
in a few words, which was conſented to; and I ſtood up and thanked them for their kind care and goodneſs to the priſoners. I told them, that if I lived to return home, I would mention it to our great people—that I was ſomething unwel when taken, but knew their goodneſs ſo well, that they would march a little flower, rather than I ſhould die like a beaſt, in the woods—that it was not common for warriors to murder their priſoners; it was only cowards reckoned among us, who abuſed priſoners; and that I had no doubt, after this uproar was over, we ſhould meet and ſhake hands: which Mr. Lara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma interpreted for me. They thanked me for my ſpeech; and my chief ſaid he would protect me thro' the woods, if I was not able to march; but I did not put much faith in what he ſaid. That night ſome of our Oneida Indians came from Fort Stanwix af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their horſes, which they ſaid belonged to them, and it being confirmed by the priſoners, they were given up; on which the Oneidas (by Mr. Larama's account) inquired whether the Indians had any of the Britiſh among them; and was anſwered in the negative. The Oneidas told them it was very well; and if they came without <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>tiſh ſoldiers, they might take as many of the Yan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> as they pleaſed, for they would meet with no hindrance from them.—After this, the Oneida Indians took the horſes back, which, in fact, belonged to the garriſon. I was aſked whoſe horſes they were, but anſwered that I could not tell; as I ſuppoſed, being an officer, had I have told them a lie, they, perhaps, would have made a ſerious matter of it. After all theſe ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, I had my arms unpinioned, with the reſt of the priſoners, and a cord tied to each arm; an old blanket <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>as ſpread for me, and I laid down between two Indians, and ſoon ſell aſleep. I was awakened
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:027681_0039_0FD5DABFB25884F0"/>
the next morning, by day break, to prepare for marching, which was done by an Indian riſing and calling how, how, how; on which, in an inſtant, every Indian was on his feet under way, in Indian file; indeed ſome warning for marching was given beforehand, when they all ſat with their knapſacks ready fixed, but from the time the word was given to denote march, I am certain the whole party was under way in a minute, and then a continual firing was kept up for (I judge) four miles. We travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led till about ten o'clock, and by going a very faſt walk, I was exceedingly faint; but eating ſome of their doe cakes, I felt revived. We halted about half an hour, and then ſet off and travelled until two o'clock, when we again halted for an hour. We then ſtarted, and continued a ſteady march until a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſun an hour high, when John Groſs, a ſoldier from Captain John Copp's company, was ſo fatigued that he was unable to proceed; he ſaid he had the cramp, but if he could reſt a few minutes, he ſhould be able to go on again. I was allowed to ſtand and talk with him a few minutes, but was ordered to march on. About ſun-down we halted, when I was informed that poor old Groſs was tomahawked and ſcalped. He belonged to the nation I was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to, was about fifty years of age, and had a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly near Albany; and what made it appear more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, he went on duty as a volunteer, in the place of another man. We ſupped on our uſual diet, and being faint and fatigued, and reflecting alſo on the treachery of the Indians in their conduct towards Groſs, as they left ſome young men with him, who pretended they would ſtay until he recovered and aſſiſt him, but on the contrary, they killed him in a few minutes after the party paſſed by; and being in the midſt of their whoopings, ſcreamings and
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:027681_0040_0FD5DAC5173E12C0"/>
yellings, I could ſometimes ſcarcely think myſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong human beings, as I could not have ſuppoſed ſo uncommon a contraſt in the diſplay of mortals, ever poſſible. I was again tied, as uſual, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a blanket ſpread for me, ſoon fell aſleep. I was awaked at the break of day, and informed that our proviſions grew ſcant, and having left ſome on their way, they were going to make a force march to the place where their proviſions were left, which was a long day's journey; and being on the twenty-fifth day of July, my birth-day, gave me ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the manner in which it was cuſtomary (for officers in particular) to celebrate the day of their birth, which is generally in feſtivity; or at leaſt, if any notice be taken of a birth day it muſt be done in merriment, and commonly with exceſs, which is certainly contrary to a right underſtanding of the day; for ſurely, at the expiration of each year we are ſo much nearer the cloſe of life, and muſt ſo much ſooner give an account, not only of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the year paſt, but alſo the whole of our miſs-ſpent time.</p>
            <p>We were ſoon under way, and marched very faſt until ten o'clock, when we made a halt. The wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being very warm, I was never nearer fainting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but eating a piece of their doe cake, and reſting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half an hour, felt more revived, although I was the whole time in great diſtreſs in my bowels, as my food was of little uſe to me. We ſtarted and travelled till two o'clock, when we arrived at one of their encampments, where we reſted about half an hour, eat ſome victuals, and again proceeded on our journey. About ſun-down we arrived at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of their encampments, where were the provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions they had left on their way. We all ſupped on ſoup made of a few pieces of pork cut into ſmall
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:027681_0041_0FD5DAC7F46D0540"/>
pieces (like crumbs of bread) ſome beans, and flour, boiled together, which was a great repaſt. I muſt ſay the priſoners were uſed well, conſidering the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation we were in. My chief gave me that day, a callico waiſtcoat. The Indians appeared to be more ſociable; and Mr. Larama informed me, that by ten o'clock the next day, we ſhould reach the boats on Lake Ontario. I ſlept that night very comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably.</p>
            <p>At break of day on the 26th, we were called on to march. My feet were ſore, having only a thin pair of mockiſons, made of deer's leather, and the land being rooty and braky, with ſeveral low inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vales, ſome pine lands and ſeveral hemlock ſwamps, although the land in general was level, or there were no mountains to paſs, and few ſtones. We marched until about nine o'clock, and forded a large creek, an entire rock on the bottom, as ſmooth as a ſlate; but in ſome places there were pretty large holes where the ſalmon kept; our Indian boys catched ſeveral and brought them on their march. This creek empties into Lake Ontario. After we paſſed the creek ſome diſtance, we halted and reſted for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fifteen minutes, at which time, ſome of the ableſt of the priſoners were ſent off with a party of young Indians, to get to the boats and prepare vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuals againſt the whole came up. We purſued our journey; the land being more uneven than what we were accuſtomed to, made it more toilſome, as we walked faſt; but about half paſt twelve o'clock, to our inexpreſſible joy, we arrived at the boats, where the party that had gone before us had ſome victuals ready cooked. We all refreſhed ourſelves on ſome fiſh, and our uſual diet, and I felt myſelf great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly revived, particularly with the thoughts of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguing march being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

is written in Provoſt at Quebec, in September, 1779, and it is on the ſtrength of my memory; but however far I may err in judgment, it was the opinion of Mr. Larama, ſerjeants Weed and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fereſt, (the two laſt were priſoners) that we travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one hundred and fifty miles; they ſaid, perhaps one hundred and ſeventy, but at a moderate computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was what was firſt mentioned, through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent land, ſome white-oak timber, but the main part beech and maple; the ſoil black and rich, very little mountainous or broken lands, and clear of ſtones; I did not notice any but would admit of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement.</p>
            <p>Our boats lay in a creek, about two miles from Lake Ontario; and, as near as I can judge, about twenty leagues from Bucks, or what the Britiſh call Carlton Iſland; they conſiſted of Britiſh batteaus and Indian canoes. The canoes were made of birch bark, lined with ſplints, and ſewed together with ſtrings made out of the roots of elm. Some of their canoes will carry twenty and ſome thirty men; and are ſo light that two of their boys could carry them. After refreſhing ourſelves, we embarked on board of the boats, about two o'clock; I was placed in the ſtern of their bark canoe, next to the ſteerſman, and was not allowed to row. We ſtood, as near as I could gueſs, after coming into the lake, about a north courſe, acroſs the eaſt end of Lake Ontario, rowing faſt until the ſun went down. One thing I thought much of, the Indian who took me firſt was in the canoe, and was a young, ſmart likely fellow; before I gave up, he was within about ſix rods of me, and frequently ordered me to ſtop, but not obeying him, he levelled his piece to fire at me, and ſhe ſnapped; on which I ſaw him fixing her to fire, and finding no poſſibility of eſcaping, handed my ſword; he returned

it to me again, and left me in charge of another In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian on the meadow, and ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to take another priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. There were ſome gulls flying over the lake, and one hovering over us, he made ſigns for me to take his gun and ſhoot it, it being the ſame he had ſnapped at me; I took the gun and ſhot the gull; and after it was brought into the canoe, there being one Indian on board who ſpoke a little Engliſh, I made him underſtand, that when the owner of the gun ſnapped it at me, it did not go off; the Indian who underſtood me, telling him of it, he immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pointed upwards, and made ſeveral jeſtures. I aſked what it meant, and the Indian told me, that the man ſaid the Great Spirit would not let his gun go off when it was pointed at me.</p>
            <p>We came to an iſland, and put up a few miles from the mouth of the river St. Lawrence, at which place we catched ſalmon and Oſwego baſs. On the morning of the 27th, we embarked and rowed about ten miles, when we came to an iſland, within ſight of the garriſon, called Carlton Iſland. The Indians painted themſelves and all the priſoners, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept myſelf; I ſpoke<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to Mr. Larama about my clothes, and mentioned, that if the Indians would let me appear amongſt the Britiſh like an American officer, I would be happy, and they could take my clothes again; On which Mr. Larama, took me to the different boats, and my clothes, even to my boots, were returned; but having a long beard, and my linen not of the whiteſt kind, I did not make ſo great a figure. We then embarked, and ſailed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſmall breeze, for the fort; we were met a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a mile from the garriſon, by a large gun-boat. The Indians lowered all their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ails, which appeared like a ſmall fleet, as that morning every one put up ſomething in ſhape of a ſquare-ſail, and of different
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:027681_0044_0FD5DACAEF322358"/>
colours—Some were red, with one or two white ſtreaks through them; ſome of one, and ſome of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other colour. The boats were all in a line, about one hundred yards apart; thoſe who had ſcalps, hoiſted them up at the bow of their boat: the ſcalps, were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Immediately on their low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering ſail, on the approach of the gun-boat, ſhe and all the Indians lay on their oars, when a general ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence enſued. At length, an Indian on the right of the line, gave as many long whoops as the nation to which he belonged had priſoners and ſcalps; the next nation in turn gave the ſame whoop, and ſo on through the ſix nations, three times over, which took I judge, near an hour; it ſeemed when they began with their whoop, they would hold their breath for a minute, and the intervals between the nations, made the ſcene melancholy indeed; when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hey had done with their long whoops, they all gave three diſmal yells, beginning on the right and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing to the left. As ſoon as they had finiſhed that part of their ceremony, the gun-boat turned and made ſail for ſhore; the Indians then began a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

the ſhore. I was ordered to ſtand up in the canoe, on our near approach to the garriſon, and had no objection, as there were a number of tories, old de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerters from our army and country, &amp;c. who were making their remarks on us in general, which was not done in a very familiar way of converſation. We paſſed ſome little diſtance along the iſland be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore landing, and on going aſhore, which the Indians pretty nearly ſtruck together, and were then as ſtill as the Pacific ocean, in a calm. On my landing, I was ſurrounded by a great number of gazing ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators, as if I had come from ſome planet or other. A tory officer aſked me for the firſt queſtion, the ſtrength of Fort Stanwix; I returned for anſwer, that being a priſoner of war, it was the rule of all chriſtianiſed nations to treat them well, and that he in a regimental dreſs, which beſpoke him an officer, certainly muſt ſuppoſe the queſtion improper: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I received from the rabble ſome heavy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciations, as rebel, &amp;c. which is improper to commit to a journal. My having on the regimentals of our regiment at the time, I ſuppoſe occaſioned more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity amongſt them, than perhaps would have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe been ſhewn; but I was not long in that ſituation before a young gentleman by the name of Smith, an Adjutant of a Britiſh regiment, came and informed me, that the commanding officer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to repair to head-quarters. I went with him, and on entering the room was met by Major Naron, the commanding officer, who accoſted me very civilly, and invited me to breakfaſt, which I readily accepted of; and I believe the whole of the garriſon officers of the Britiſh line were at breakfaſt. I continued at head-quarters until one o'clock. Mr. Smith made me a preſent of a ſilk handkerchief. The Major aſked me in private, a few queſtions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:027681_0046_0FD5DAD06D65A4A0"/>
to our main army, and General Sullivan's movements; but I knew but trifling about either, &amp; was rather more ignorant at that time than common. I mentioned to one of the officers, that I thought the Indians muſt be of great expence to the crown, as the ſcout that took us had expended a great deal of proviſion, and were on their return back, conſtantly firing and waſting their ammunition. He told me that he had made a computation of the expence the party was at that had taken us, and it could not fall much ſhort (if any) of one thouſand eight hundred pounds ſterling money, or that would be the expend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iture by the time the Indians gave the priſoners all up. It ſeems that we had three young kings in the party, and they being all Canadian Indians, (which I was ignorant of until we got to Lake Ontario) leave was aſked to addreſs the commanding officer; which was conſented to; and after the Major had ſeated himſelf, the three young Blood Royals were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a ſeat not far from him; an interpreter was at hand, and an old Chief aroſe with a great deal of compoſure, and addreſſed his Kings in a long and ſpirited ſpeech, whilſt the old Major who was a Scotchman, and as much of a gentleman as walked the Britiſh army, ſat knitting his brows, not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding a word, as I took it; and after the Chief had finiſhed, the Major addreſſed the interpreter—"weal and what is all this? Whey do they want now." The interpreter mentioned, that the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of their ſpeech was, that they and a number of their anceſtors had been old ſervants to their Great Father, who lived acroſs the big water, and that they (the party) had now ſeriouſly taken up the hatchet for his defence, and meant at all times to hold themſelves in readineſs to go out againſt the people who ſat around the council fire, and who had
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:027681_0047_0FD5DA9C6DDB1ED8"/>
taken up the hatchet againſt their Great Father and his warriors, (meaning the King of Great-Britain and his army) and, that as it was the firſt time they had gone out, and had done their beſt in taking pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners and ſcalps, they wiſhed to have a barrel of milk (that is rum) to make themſelves merry with.</p>
            <p>The old Major, after a ſhort pauſe, expreſſed himſelf as follows—"And what is it they want—a barrel of rum, to get all drunk and kill the priſoners. The De'il on them and their rum, they ſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

About one o'clock, my chief came for me to go to the boat, in order to ſet off. I took my leave of the gentlemen, who treated me with a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of politeneſs, I mean thoſe of the line in the Britiſh army; as to the tory officers, there was not common notice taken of them. We all ſat off, and went on our way down the river St. Lawrence, which is very deep and of an eaſy current. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as we glided along ſhore, ſome very inſulting language from men who had deſerted from our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment. The river I ſuppoſed two miles wide.—We rowed about thirty miles, and lay that night on the weſtern ſhore; the Indians ſhot ſome fowls, ſuch as gulls, and a few other kinds, and catched ſome fiſh.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the 28th, before day, we were all under way down the river, and ſun about half an hour high, ſhot ſome ducks that could not fly, as I was informed, they had ſhed their feathers. They were fine and fleſhy, but of what kind I cannot tell; ſome
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:027681_0048_0FD5DAAFC978D1E8"/>
gulls alſo, were killed, and indeed the Indians would ſhoot any fowl—crows, hawks, &amp;c. and eat them, but I never was offered any but ſuch as were good birds. About nine o'clock we came too, and cooked our fowls. Our boat that morning was ahead, and the batteaus being heavy, were generally in the rear. I cool<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d a duck, and found it delicious food. We embarked in about an hour, and rowed ſteady until four o'clock, when we arrived at Oſwegotia, a Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh garriſon, about thirty-five leagues from Car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ton iſland, and the whole of the way a gradual ſtill cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; the river appeared ſo deep, that I judge a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of heavy burthen might paſs up and down. I was invited into the quarters of Captain Robertſon, who was commanding officer, and received <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e into his room with hoſpitality, as himſelf and a Captain Frazier, who was there, had been taken priſoners, at St. John's, and were through Elizabeth-Town; and after being informed that it was my native place, they appeared to give me every mark of their friendſhip, as well as the other priſoners, who all ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived a ſhort time after us. I continued at head quarters until about midnight, and fared as well as I could wiſh. I told Capt. Robertſon, I thought it beſt for me to go and lodge with my chief—He replied that a bed was provided for me. But as I knew we muſt ſtart by day-light, and my clothes being none of the neateſt, having been ſo long with the Indians, I prevailed and took my leave, and ſlept with my chief as uſual.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the 29th, before day-break, we aroſe, eat ſome victual<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and as ſoon as it was light enough, embarked and rowed down the river St. Lawrence about ſix or eight miles, with nearly the ſame current; the river then begins to run ſtronger, and at the diſtance of two miles further, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes

a mere rapid in ſome places, by reaſon of large rocks lying in the river, ſome of which it is ſuppoſed, are not more than four feet below the ſurface of the water, which occaſions the water to heave into ſwells, and obliges the boats to keep in ſhore, or by the iſlands, as there are ſeveral in that part of the river; we judged that we drove down with the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ten or twelve miles an hour. We continued along ſhore for better than an hour, the water grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething ſmoother; the Indians in our boat ſaw a large buck ſwimming, they made after him and he was ſoon overtaken and killed. About two o'clock came too and dreſſed the veniſon; he was divided into as many parts as there were Indians and priſoners, and after being boiled, every perſon had their piece. We then ſat off, and in half an hour arrived at an Indian town called Tuſkerora, where one of the nations that were in the party lived; ſix of the priſoners fell to them, and were put on ſhore; we tarried half an hour, and then proceeded, leaving the ſix priſoners mentioned, with them; the current not being ſo rapid, and after having a ſmall thunder-guſt (which occaſioned a fair wind) we put up our ſail and ran about ten miles, to a ſmall Lake in the river, about thirteen miles in length, and four in breadth, which we croſſed that afternoon and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening. About ten o'clock at night we came too on the weſt ſhore by an Indian houſe, as near as I could calculate, thirty leagues from Oſwegotia.</p>
            <p>On the thirtieth, early in the morning, we em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked and went about fifteen or twenty miles down the river with a forcable current. Two Indians, with one of the priſoners and myſelf were put on ſhore; we travelled about two miles and ſtopped at a Frenchman's houſe, who gave us ſome bread and milk, and each a twiſt of tobacco. We then went
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:027681_0050_0FD5DA97F528E300"/>
on about eight miles and came to our boats, which were two miles up the river, that leads out of the Lake of two mountains into St. Lawrence; there were two nations at this place called Conoſodagoes and Mohawks; the other three nations, lived farther down the river St. Lawrence—we embarked and rowed up the river near thirty miles, and paſſed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral French ſettlements and Indian huts, but were met about ten miles from the Lake, by two canoes, having ſome of their chiefs on board, who congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated their friends and brothers, as they were from the ſame town to which our party belonged. We all rowed until we came to the lake, and put up on an iſland about two miles from their town, where the Indians painted themſelves and the priſoners. We had a viſit from a number of boats from the town, having Squaws on board, who brought cakes for their friends and the priſoners; the ſquaws ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to have the immediate rule and conduct of the priſoners; I was put into a canoe with ſome of the chiefs' wives. We then rowed for the town, leaving all the Indians and priſoners behind on the iſland. When we came on ſhore, a young rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed ſquaw came and took me by the hand, and led me part of the way through the town into a houſe, and paſſing one room, entered a genteel parlor, handſomely papered, with a good deſk, cheſt and chairs, in as faſhionable a manner as an Engliſh room, although I believe it was the only decent apartment in the town, as I ſaw none of the like in the other houſes. After being a few minutes ſeated by the mother of the young ſquaw in a decent chair, and ſome drink being prepared for me, I made ſigns that I wanted to go to the door to ſee the priſoners come in; which was granted. Previous to the approach of the Indians, a cannon that was in town, was load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:027681_0051_0FD5DA9B0BE07378"/>
and prepared, and alſo, a large flag-ſtaff was ſtanding with the colours flying. The Indians ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on the lake, moving very ſlowly all in a line, and on their near approach, gave a running fire from right to left, and was anſwered by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their cannon, which was repeated three times over. They then exerted themſelves to get on ſhore, in the ſame manner as at Carlton Iſland. An Indian boy took one of the priſoners by the hand and ran to the flag-ſtaff; they appeared promiſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to every one catch at the firſt priſoner they could get hold of, and immediately run to the ſtaff, until they had all arrived; the whole of the Indians and priſoners then danced round the flag for about fifteen minutes, and all at once, each Indian who had his priſoner, ſat off running and pulling his priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with him as faſt as poſſible to the council houſe, and all the reſt of the Indians after them yelling and ſcreaming with all their might; they continued dancing with the priſoners for near half an hour, the whole time ſinging a war ſong, and then each Indian took his priſoner home with him, without being the leaſt abuſed or hurt, and gave them pl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of proviſions.—What a happy circumſtance was this! for inſtead of being bound in thongs, and ſuffering the moſt excruciating tortures, by having the finger nails torn out, and pine knots drove into the fleſh and ſat on fire, with many other unheard of tortures, we were all treated like chriſtians, not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven having been compelled to run what is termed the gantlet, although it is cuſtomary for the Indians to form two lines, about ſix feet apart, between which the priſoners muſt run and receive blows with fiſts, clubs, and ſometimes tomahawks, and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="54" facs="unknown:027681_0052_0FD5DA8E2E913038"/>
men. One thing I would not wiſh to omit on this occaſion, and which I ſuppoſe was a favor to the priſoners. There were in the town, a large cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, or houſe of worſhip, and three Roman clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men reſided among the ſavages, by which means the town is under ſtrict and religious regulations, according to their manner of worſhipping, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears with ſolemnity. I was viſited by the three gentlemen, and invited to dine with them, which I readily accepted of, and was received with as great a degree of cordiality as I ever met with in any place. I continued to dine and ſup with them during my ſtay at the place, as it was cuſtomary to break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt at home on bread and milk, and ſometimes tea—The catholic prieſts make no formal breakfaſt, as they generally, and I believe always, attend to prayers from 6 until 9 or ten in the morning, and then take a cut of bread and cheeſe, or ſome light diet, but regularly dine at twelve on rich food, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Friday and Saturday; they eat no meat on thoſe days, but fiſh, butter, eggs, &amp;c. is their diet. The Indians are very attentive on maſs, and ſing melodiouſly, particularly the women; every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening they all attend worſhip, and on their bended knees ſeem to offer ſincere devotion to the King of Kings. I was ſtrictly attentive to their maſs, as it would have even diſpleaſed what we deem the wild ſavage of the woods, not to have paid my devotion with them.</p>
            <p>On the firſt day of Auguſt, a large Indian came to my quarters and ordered me by ſigns to take off my coat and jacket, which I at once complied with; he then brought me a long coat, waiſtcoat, and leggons, and dreſſed me in the manner of themſelves, and then took me to the flag-ſtaff, where, after giving three long and ſolemn whoops, the whole of the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:027681_0053_0FD5DAADD70F3E78"/>
town appeared inſtantly to aſſemble. One of the chiefs made a lengthy and loud ſpeech, and from what I could gather, the purport was,—that after a loſs cometh gain; ſtating the ſucceſs they had gained by their arms, and that now, having priſoners in poſſeſſion, they could be put in the place of ſome of their loſt relatives: on which I was adopted by one of the chief's inſtead of an uncle he had loſt about a year before, and who I underſtood died a natural death. They have no very formal way of adopting, except by laying their hands on the priſoner's head, and a few ceremonies of the like in the time of their orations, and then he is delivered to the man by whom adopted, who in a friendly manner takes him by the hand and kiſſes him, and then the ſquaws, (every one who bears any relation to the family wherein the priſoner is adopted.) The whole of the priſoners were ſerved in the ſame way. I am of opinion, ſhould this journal be read, ſome will ſay that when the Indians adopt, they are not apt to give their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners up; but let it ſuffice, that what is written can be proved by living and ſubſtantial witneſſes. A handſome room was provided for me, but I believe it is cuſtomary for the civilized nations to be more particular in their furniture. I remember an inſtance in the Onondago nation, of a family (their names I do not recollect) whoſe houſe was faſhionably furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, after the manner of white people; and would further remark, that where the Indians place their confidence or good will, they are very particular, and warmly attached; their uncommon friendſhip to an adopted priſoner will prove my aſſertion. Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally a remark on the ſavages of America, is worthy of our attention. If the whole of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians were under religious government, and civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, what a great family of people they muſt be;
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:027681_0054_0FD5DAAB7AE42FE8"/>
although I am of opinion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they could never be brought to live in the manner of the white people, as their conſtitutions appear to be adapted for the wilderneſs; and it has often been noticed, that they decrea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> in an old ſettled country: but what I mean, is reſpecting their moral principles, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of worſhip: but this will be a work of time, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a friendly aid would not be amiſs.</p>
            <p>After being adopted, by my couſin, a room in his houſe was provided for me; therefore I had to leave my parlor, although I was often a viſitor, and in fact, was, with the other priſoners, treated with great friendſhip by the whole of the inhabitants. The town lies on an elbow, much in the manner of New-York, having a handſome lake in the front, lying ſouth from the town, and on the north ſide, the river which is ſaid to lead from Michilimachinac, of a large extent, and oppoſite the town middling wide; it runs bye, and empties into the lake, and from thence to the river St. Lawrence, and I imagine lies about 45 leagues from Oſwegotia, about a north courſe.</p>
            <p>The Indians do but very little labour in the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and have dances almoſt every day, in a long houſe built for that purpoſe; the men dance by themſelves in a long ring, as their houſes are lengthy, but not wide. They have a narrow rim, in ſhape of a drum, with two heads to it and a ſmall mallet with which one ſtrikes on the head; four men have each two ſticks, and ſtrike them together; another one has a hollow gourd with ſhot or corn in it; he firſt ſets his muſic to play, by giving his gourd three or four ſhal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> quick, with a ſong accompanying his time, and then more ſlow, on which the drum ſets in, with the four who have ſticks, and all ſtrike together; their ſong and whole muſic beats together, which make it not diſagreeable, as their dances are very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular.
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:027681_0055_0FD5DA7C2CD7C838"/>
The Indians have ſmall bells around their ancles to make a jingling, and ſtamp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ard on the ground, as a wooden floor would diſcommode their method of dancing. They have a great number of attitudes and poſitions in their whole dance, which laſts ſometimes two hours, and from the firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of it until the whole are on the floor, does not exceed fifteen minutes; the women ſlide on their heels and toes, by forming a ring, and will go round in that manner for a great number of times; they have no other method of dancing, and I think have no inſtrumental muſic, but ſing merrily, and are very jocular and ſociable in their dances.—There are a few French families in town.</p>
            <p>In the fall of the year, all the Indians, men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and children, except a few old and decrepit perſons, go up the river four, five, and ſometimes ſix hundred miles, and ſtay all winter, where they live by hunting, and in the ſpring return down the river with their peltry, meats, &amp;c. and by what lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle grain they raiſe, and the profits they get on their furr, with the fiſh which they catch in the lake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the town, (which are plenty) all contribute to make them live eaſy the whole ſummer, and to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance plentiful, particularly as to bread, as they had a baker in town, and many bought conſtantly. The firſt ſabbath I went to maſs, my couſin dreſſed me in a long ſcarlet coat, velvet jacket, and a large cocked hat, all trimmed with broad tinſey lace, with ſcarlet leggons, mockiſons trimmed very gay with ribbons and the like, and a ſilver headed ſword, a ruffled ſhirt, and I muſt ſay, that I felt quite import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant through the day. After the forenoon exerciſe was over, a white woman came and aſked me in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh, what part of America I lived in when at home. I informed her near Elizabeth-Town, in New-Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey.

who ſpoke conſiderable good Engliſh, and appeared to be a man well bred, and much of a gentleman, as were the others; and I underſtood they were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the crown of France, to diſſeminate what knowledge they could amongſt the Indians: as the town conſiſted of two nations, there were a number of people aſſembled to worſhip. Every morning I took a walk by the ſide of the river and lake, which gave a beautiful proſpect, being about thirty miles in length, and ten in breadth, and on the point is a ſmall breaſtwork built of ſtone, where their cannon is placed, I ſuppoſe an indulgence from the Engliſh. There are in the town a number of bark canoes, which I underſtood were built the laſt French war; the bark itſelf is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

By pacing the length of ſome of the boats, I found them ſixty feet; with a proportionable width, and would undoubtedly carry fifty men or more, with proviſions. About a mile from the town, is a ſmall building on an eminence, with a croſs near it, where they all go once a year in proceſſion to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in the manner of the Roman Catholics.</p>
            <p>On the ninth of Auguſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the evening, I was informed that the next day we were all to embark for Montreal; and on the tenth, after dining with the prieſts and a gentleman from near Montreal, I took any leave of them and the town, although my couſin, his wife, with every priſoner's relation, came on board of can<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

New-England, and was gone to Michilimachinac trading. She uſed me very well, and I was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated with a genteel room, a good ſupper, and liquors: the priſoners all fared very well, and next morning we ſat out on foot, after breakfaſt, and travelled to Montreal. We paſſed ſeveral churches and French ſettlements, from the lake of two moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> to Montreal; they were cutting their wheat, which was of a middling ſize. The drought was ſo ſevere that the graſs appeared to be ſcorched; the land looked like a white loam. About eleven o'clock, we arrived at Montreal, after travelling better than ten miles. I was conducted to Mr. Luke Le Corn's houſe, who treated me to a glaſs of good old Madei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra. Doctor Huntly who has the care of the nun's hoſpital, came into Mr. Le Corn's, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended me to ſaid place for the recovery of my health, as I was far from being in a ſound ſtate of body. A French gentleman who had a Britiſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and had been taken with General Burgoyne, was alſo at Le Corn's, &amp; walked with me to Colonel Campbell's quarters, who had the command, or rather was an agent of the Indian department, and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with politeneſs. Whilſt I was at the Colonel's quarters, Alexander Campbell came into the room, and as I had quartered in his houſe at Schenectady, we were acquainted with each other, and then living in Montreal, he obtained permiſſion for me to go home with him; and on our arrival, Mrs. Campbell ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared rejoiced to ſee me, and we all dined together as mutually as formerly. After dining, I took my leave of Mrs. Campbell; Mr. Campbell walked with me to the nun's hoſpital; after my arrival, a centinel was placed at the door to keep me from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting. The nuns never marry, and when they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the hoſpital it is for life, if they behave well;
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:027681_0059_0FD5DAB26B5B0B78"/>
they take in the ſick of the town, and are ſupported that way, and the patient pays according to his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, from a low to a high price. There are no peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple more faithful to their patients; two of them are up at a time the whole night, to give them drink and medicine, according to the directions of the phyſicians. Their hoſpital is kept very clean, and in warm weather, cool, by ſprinkling the floor with vinegar, or ſomething to make it agreeable; the beds are neat, and in two rows, as the houſe is long but not wide, an entry way is between the beds, having green curtains, which is a great help to the eyes of perſons, particularly when weak; each pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient has his bed, and is never offered victuals or medicine, before the perſon who gives it aſks a bleſſing on it. They are conſtant in prayer at ſix o'clock every morning, and frequent maſs, all which is performed on the bended knees, to appearance, with great devotion; in fact, through all their ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar duties of domeſtic life, they appear to invoke the Great Arbiter of the univerſe for a bleſſing; and what is ſingular, amongſt ſo many women, and for ſo long a duration, all is harmony and concord, not ſo much as a contradiction, which muſt proceed from that regularity of ſyſtem which is kept up among them, both civil and religious. In the evening I was viſited by Stephen Tuthill, (who formerly lived at Saratoga, he left the Americans in the ſpring of 1779, and married Major John Graham's ſiſter) who gave me a bottle of Madeira; indeed I owe a debt of gratitude to ſeveral gentlemen, who frequently paid me their viſits, and were kind and liberal; but would rather ſuppoſe it imprudent to mention their names in this journal, for fear of accident: for not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I am ſenſible that in this province there are many ſincere friends to the cauſe of America,

yet the major part of the military dons in particular, are vaſtly important, and even knit their brow at the ſight of a rebel, and portend with great compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his fate to be deſperate.</p>
            <p>Auguſt 12th.—This afternoon I had a viſit from a French lady, who made me a preſent of a handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and ſeveral other things; ſhe was acquainted in Elizabeth-Town, and appeared to be a perſon of diſtinction. Colonel Campbell and my couſins viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me; the Indians alſo came to take their final leave of me; my couſin Indian made a ſpeech, the purport as follows—that he had come to pay me his laſt viſit, and was in hopes that after the uproar be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Great King and my council and warriors was over, that we might meet again, and be great friends, as he looked upon me as an uncle, and I was going to be for a long time (if not forever) loſt from him, for which reaſon he could not help me any more; he left me as long as I remained priſoner, to the care of the great men, who acted under his Great Father, over the big water, (meaning the king of England)—he wiſhed me very well, and that if ever I returned home again to my friends, which he was in hopes I ſhould; he adviſed me not to get drunk and from my ſenſes again, in fighting againſt his Great Father and mother (meaning the King of England and people) which he looked on as wrong; and that our men, who ſat around the Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Fire, and held the big knife, under whom I acted (meaning Congreſs) were all drunk and from their ſenſes, in fighting and acting againſt his and our Great Fathers and mothers—and then himſelf and wife bade me farewell, ſhook hands, kiſſed me, and ſhed plenty of tears. Surely ſaid I this is friendſhip indeed; it brought to my mind the beautiful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Doctor Young, in his night thoughts, on friendſhip.</p>

               <pb n="63" facs="unknown:027681_0061_0FD5DA40EF18D998"/>
The next day Colonel Campbell ſent me a blue broad cloth coat, under clothes, ſtockings, ſhoes, buckles, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>On the 14th, being ſtill unwell, and as there was ſcarcely any one to converſe with, (for what was ſpoken, was chiefly in the French language) I made application to go to the general hoſpital, which was granted; and Mr. Jones, maſter of Provoſt, walked with me; we had a ſociable converſation together on the war between England and America. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be a man of ſenſe, and ſeemed to ſpeak feelingly on the unhappy diſpute. On my arrival at the hoſpital, I was introduced to Captain Gideon Brownſon, an American officer, who was wounded in the foot, having one of his toes ſhot off, and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven wounds in his body by ſmall ſhot; a ſerjeant being with him from the fame regiment, who had received a ball through the knuckle of his left hand. It ſeems that a party on the 15th of July, 1779, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of Major Hopkins, Captain Brownſon, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Smith, Lieutenant Dunning, two ſerjeants and ſome privates, (two of whom had wives) went to the fourteen mile iſland, on lake George, on a party to fiſh and gather ſome berries which were plenty there. The wind blew up ahead towards night, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with rain, and they having no apprehenſion of danger, drew their boats on ſhore, which they turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over and lay under all the night; but it appeared the Indians that day had diſcovered them, and on ſeeing an old batteau on a ſmall iſland below, ſwam to it, and fixed it so as to be able by the aſſiſtance of that boat to go to the iſland where the party was, and juſt as the day broke, landed and fired on the whole as they lay under the boats without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of an enemy being near; they killed the Major, a ſerjeant, five privates, a little boy, and the
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:027681_0062_0FD5DA8892EC1DC0"/>
two women, one of whom had a ſucking child in her arms which was alſo killed. The men were ſcalped, but it is ſaid the women were not; the remainder were brought into Montreal, conſiſting of Captain Brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Captain Smith, Lieutenant Dunning, Serjeant Curtis, and three privates; they belonged to Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Warner's regiment. Captain Smith and lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Dunning were confined in the Provoſt at Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal, amongſt all ſorts of priſoners. The ſame day Colonel Campbell viſited me, and made me a preſent of ſome ſtockings and a half-joe—In juſtice to that gentleman, I muſt ſay, that I was treated with a great degree of attention, benevolence and philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy. I cannot omit mentioning the goodneſs of Mr. James White, merchant in Montreal, when at the nun's hoſpital; he every morning ſent me a good diſh of green tea and toaſt, with ſome port wine, which, conſidering the nature of my diſorder, was to my benefit, which bounties appeared to be dictated by the feelings of humanity, and not from an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ea of being deemed a friend to the American cauſe. I had a few turns of the fever and ague, but Doctor Morrington, head phyſician of the hoſpital, gave me relief ſo as to prevent their return. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Brownſon and myſelf, can have no reaſon of complaint reſpecting our treatment at that place, as we were found with ſuch neceſſaries as were for our comfort, and we alſo daily received ſmall preſents from particular gentlemen.</p>
            <p>Auguſt 21ſt.—About ten o'clock this morning we received orders to be ready to embark for Quebec, and at four in the afternoon went on board the Snow Liberty, Captain Moore, commander, where I was introduced to Captain Simeon Smith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> formerly from Litchfield, in Connecticut, and Lieutenant Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael Dunning, from Ballſtown, in the ſtate, of
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:027681_0063_0FD5DA4FB6C2C89"/>
New-York; Captain Brownſon was from Vermont, ſerjeants Weed and Deforeſt, with ſeven privates who were taken with me, were on board; alſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven old men from the Mohawk river, and ſerjeant Curtis. The officers are the gentlemen who were taken on the fourteen mile iſland, and were, before the unhappy cataſtrophe, quartered at Fort George; they and Major Hopkins, were ever eſteemed brave good officers; but it was certainly imprudent to lay in ſuch a place without a centinel planted; ſtill from what has been before mentioned, they being ſo ſecure in their own minds, pleads for the neglect; yet I hope it will prove a warning for the future, to all perſons who ſhall ever hear of the circumſtance. On board of our veſſel was a guard of ſixteen men, of what was called Scotch emigrants, of Colonel M'Leans rigiment, the guard was commanded by an enſign named M'Graw. In the ſaid corps were fifty men who were taken from our army, on the attempt to ſtorm Quebec; the reſt conſiſted of all nations, all ſorts, and all ſizes, (ſpeaking not far from within bounds.) We lay that night before Montreal; ſome of the officers ſlept on the quarter deck, expoſed to the night air, but I went into the hold of the veſſel and the eaſieſt birth I found, was the coil of a large cable; I laid myſelf on that and took ſome reſt, as our Captain appeared to be one of thoſe ſort of people who wiſh to make a ſhort affair of converſation or politeneſs; for he neither gave us a friendly anſwer to a queſtion, altho' aſked ever ſo civilly, nor had the manners to aſk a man to his cabbin door, nor to eat or drink with him; and to make ſhort of my text, he was the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed brute I ever met with, or ever ſhall.</p>
            <p>Early the next morning we weighed anchor, and having a fair wind with a ſtrong current, ſailed faſt,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:027681_0064_0FD5DA86C4A4DF90"/>
and paſſed ſeveral ſmall ſettlements, having churches in each ſettlement; about three o'clock in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon we came to anchor before Sorell, it being about fifteen leagues from Montreal. Our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander went on ſhore, and in one hour returned, weighed anchor and proceeded on our voyage until the ſetting of the ſun, when he again came to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor at the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th of a ſmall lake, called Saint Peter.</p>
            <p>On the 23d we made ſail, with a fine fair breeze, and paſſed the lake which is ſhoal, except the channel. It was ſaid, that part of the lake which is under water in the Spring, is mowed in the Summer; every ſail on board was ſet. At eight o'clock, we paſſed a ſettlement, named Maſhiſh, where the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries live, or many of them; it is a ſmall town, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the tory ſettlement, a particular aſſylum for wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who are from the American ſtates, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of a home. By eleven o'clock we paſſed the three rivers, where the tide flows about two feet, although it makes no current up. We proceeded on the whole day, and by ſailing in a fine river, the banks and houſes affording a beautiful proſpect, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſeveral large topſail merchant veſſels which we paſſed, laden with goods, proviſions, &amp;c. from Ireland, chiefly for Montreal, made it more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, and ſeemed to elevate at times our diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable ſituation. At ſun-down, the veſſel came to anchor, within ten miles of Quebec; the flood ran ſo ſtrong that no head way to ſignify, could be made.</p>
            <p>The twenty-fourth, weighed anchor early in the morning, the wind ahead, but beating with a ſtrong ebb, we anchored before Quebec at ten o'clock in the morning, it being ſixty leagues from Montreal. The common ebbing and flowing of the tide at this
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:027681_0065_0FD5DA8539401CD8"/>
place, is ten feet perpendicular, and the ſpring tides, often fifteen. The current runs with great force, both in the flood and ebb, and often in the winter fails of freezing acroſs. The river is narrower at Quebec, than in any place from the mouth to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal, which occaſions the tide to run with more ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity at Quebec, than in any other part of the river, although there is a great current from Quebec to Newfoundland in particular. In about an hour's time after firſt coming to anchor, we hauled along ſide of a large letter of marque<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mounting twenty-ſix guns, named the Brilliant; ſome gentlemen who were on board of the ſhip, ſent us four bottles of porter. There were thirty pieces of cannon with carriages, hoiſted out of the Brilliant, and put on board of the Snow. That night we ſtill ſuffered more than formerly, as there was no place to lie on but thoſe carriages and guns; however, on the next day, a long boat came along ſide and took us all from our pleaſant Captain, and we were put on board of a ſhip, named the York, mounting twenty-ſix guns, commanded by Richard Brewer, an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh gentleman, who formerly ſailed out of South-Carolina, for a gentleman (I think) by the name of Cox. Captain Brewer and the firſt mate being on ſhore, the ſhip was then under the command of a Mr. Johnſon, ſecond mate, who confined us all down in the hold of the veſſel, in the gun room; there were twenty-one of us: the dead lights were chained and locked up, which made our ſituation diſagreeable, as it was dark, and we could not ſtand ſtrait up, by reaſon of the deck being ſo low. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, two of the priſoners were admitted on deck at a time, as our guard was put on board to keep us ſafe; we had to go up through a ſmall ſcuttle, which would not admit more than one perſon to go up at a

time, and on deck ſtood a brave ſoldier, with a fixed bayonet, to attend on the manoeuvring of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners who went on deck. It was truly laughable to ſee ſixteen ſoldiers under arms on deck, to guard twenty-one poor diſarmed priſoners, and the ſhip's crew contained not much ſhort of one hundred men; however, as we were men of importance, ſafety was neceſſary, and the guard continued on board during our ſtay. About ſun-ſet, Captain Brewer came on board, and ſent for thoſe who were officers when taken priſoners, and invited the whole into his cabbin, where we remained during our ſtay on board, and received the politeſt treatment I ever met with in the whole of my captivity, as we were treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the beſt of diet, and drink of every kind; the Captain frequently had other Captains of veſſels to dine and ſup with him, and we were ſharers in his entertainments; in a word, no men could be better uſed; and the other priſoners alſo experienced the bounty of that good man. In juſtice to the firſt mate, Mr. Colereach, Mr. Johnſon ſecond mate, and the doctor, whoſe name is Mua, I muſt ſay that they were friendly, kind-hearted men; in fact it ſometimes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared that we were not priſoners as there was ſo much friendſhip from the officers and ſhips crew to the priſoners as will never be eraſed. The charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Johnſon, the ſecond <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, was droll and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; he is a New-England man, and would walk the deck ſometimes for an hour, the whole time praying to his Maker, ſo loud that he could be heard in any part of the ſhip, and ſeemed to be in great earneſt, aſking forgiveneſs of his ſins; and penetential expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions appeared to flow from his lips with a ſincere contrition of heart; but in the midſt of theſe ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if he ſaw a ſailor doing any thing amiſs, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on the yard arm or round top, he would ſwear at
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:027681_0067_0FD5DA6F6FF7B960"/>
him with ſuch vehemence, that he would appear to damn him, the yard arm, round top, maſts, ſhip and crew, and the next minute praying and aſking forgiveneſs for all his ſins; in ſhort, he was a very good natured man, but an old ſeaman, and was ſo addicted to ſwearing, that he often told me he did not know when he ſwore: he put me in mind of a man named Tom Pope, who would uſe by turns ill lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and then aſked forgiveneſs, and ſaid he muſt pay as he went on. However, relative to poor John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I have reaſon to believe the man was hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily ſorry for his allowing himſelf in ſuch lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage; but it ſeems the ſailors were rather remiſs in obeying his commands, until he made uſe of ſuch expreſſions, on purpoſe to make their merriment. He often lamented to me, that it was his lot to be a ſeaman on account of the practice which generally prevails among that claſs of men, in uſing profane language, and ſaid, that when he was young, he had no fear of God before his eyes, and became one of the profaneſt wretches that ever exiſted, but then ſeemed to lament his former and preſent conduct: particularly his having taken God's name in vain; but being ſo addicted to the practice, it ſeemed an impoſſibility to leave it off, although he ſaid it was his intention to quit the ſea-faring buſineſs, and take ſome other calling by reaſon of the habit. The officers who dined and ſupped on board the York, are named Drew, Scott and Gray; they were Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's of large ſhips; I think Drew commanded a Frigate, and was an acting commodore; they were much of gentlemen, and I ſhould be very happy if either of them ſhould ever go into the United States, that they might be treated with cordiality for their politeneſs to the priſoners, as alſo the mates and doctor of the ſhip York. On the thirtieth inſtant,

Captain Smith, Lieutenant Dunning, Serjeant Weed, and myſelf, petitioned our brethren, the Free-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in Quebec, for aſſiſtance, in particular ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, but no anſwer was received; and we have ſince been informed, they deem us traitors, for taking up arms againſt their King.</p>
            <p>September 1ſt.—We hear that four thouſand men from the Britiſh fleet laying off Portſmouth, deſerted on the fourth ult. The priſoners received a ſhirt and jacket each; I had a blanket coat.</p>
            <p>Tueſday 7th.—Mr. Miles Prentiſs, the Provoſt maſter in Quebec, came on board with orders for us to leave the ſhip and go on ſhore; on which we made ready, and embarked on board a large long boat, and landed in the town with our guard, and were march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the jail, being obliged to carry our bedding and ſpare clothes on our backs through the town, and on our arrival at our place of confinement, had a room for the officers adjoining where the other priſoners who accompanied us were put. We were allowed, through clemency, the privilege of taking two of the priſoners, by the name of Iſaac Hubble and Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah Frazier, to cook for us; the doors were then locked faſt; and for the firſt piece of buſineſs, our room is meaſured, and find it twenty feet long, and ten wide, having a dirty rough ſtone floor, and are obliged to keep the window-ſhuts open for air, there being no glaſs except half way from the top down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the frame being long; when our ſhuts are cloſed, we are obliged to ſtand on our fine table, which is of oak plank, an inch and an half thick, and was made for the ſoldiers the laſt French war, and is as black as greaſe and dirt mixed together, can any way make it:—on this piece of furniture we often ſtand and look or peep out through the glaſs. Our diſhes are wooden alſo, and appear to have had a

Our beds and bolſters are ſtuffed with ſtraw, and laid on bunks; pillows we have none;—thus are we fixed, which conſidering all things, does not appear very agreeable. This afternoon Richard Murray, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> commiſſary of the priſoners, viſited us and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be much of a gentleman; gave us flattering promiſes of a ſpeedy releaſe from our preſent ſituation, liberty of the yard, &amp;c. but he had a maſter by the name of Frederick Haldiman, who was General and commander in chief of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Canada, a man exactly adapted to ſuit his Britannic Majeſty and miniſtry.</p>

            <p>On the 19th, Mr. Murray viſited us, when Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Brownſon and Smith, informed him that they had no over-clothing, except a blanket coat, and had the promiſe of more clothing. Mr. Miles Prentiſs, ſends us every day good freſh beef, mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton or veal; we are allowed ſpruce beer, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatoes by turns. Our bedding is none of the beſt, as the ſheets are as coarſe as is any way needful, and water I am certain they never touched. We really cut a figure, in particular when our dinner is paraded; our black wooden diſhes put on ſo ſhining a hue, and graced with our mahogany oak, beſpeak American officers indeed; and to confirm my aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on the 27th, we received each of us a white flannel jacket, and ammunition breeches.</p>
            <p>October the 5th.—Arrived from England, a ſmall fleet, having a few German troops on board. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Brownſon went to the hoſpital for the recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of his health. On the 7th, Captain Brownſon returned again.—The number of priſoners in this town (the largeſt number of which are militia, who
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:027681_0074_0FD5DA1406159E00"/>
were taken from their farms) is about one hundred, although there are many ſeamen confined in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent parts of the jail, and numbers go on board of ſhipping for England.</p>
            <p>On the 14th—A report of the Seneca's country being cut off.</p>
            <p>21ſt—A hard froſt laſt night. We were this day viſited by a Doctor Apdell, an acquaintance of Capt. Smith's and Lieut. Dunning's, who informs of a ſmall picket sort, belonging to the Americans, being taken by a Britiſh officer and twenty men, with two hundred Indians, and ſays that the priſoners are brought into Montreal; but cannot inform what garriſon or what officer was taken. He made us (for the firſt) a preſent of a dollar.</p>
            <p>25th—A pleaſant day. It has been a remarkable warm, dry ſummer in this province, by information; and this fall, graſs, grain, and all kinds of roots have much failed. We wrote a petition to-day to Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Haldiman, deſiring to be ſent this fall to New-York, or admitted on parole. Yeſterday, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, two Germans who were in the Britiſh ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, went up the river and drowned themſelves. The ſame day two Britiſh officers fought a duel on board a veſſel, and one of them was killed.</p>
            <p>26th. The fleet fell down the river this morning to Patrick's Hole, for England. A Lieut. Col. Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, of the militia, from Boſton, and a French offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, were brought in priſoners this day: they were taken at a place called Konopſcot, in New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. The Colonel ſays, he had a valuable packet going to General Gates.</p>
            <p>November 2d—Snow the chief of this day. The 31ſt regiment arrived from St. John's laſt evening, and relieved the German guards.</p>
            <p>5th—Colonel Lowder and the French officer em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:027681_0075_0FD5DA1C39078490"/>
this morning for Halifax, and are to be ſent to Boſton for an exchange, by whom we ſent ſome letters; I forwarded two, one of them to Colonel Van Schaick, and the other to Captain Euſtis, of the artillery.</p>
            <p>On the 6th, Mr. Murray viſited us, and informed, that the General will not admit us to go to New-York, nor on parole, and gave directions for us to be removed from where we then were, into the lower barracks; and about one o'clock, we left our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, table, and all our diſhes, and went into a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable place, although a ſtone floor is one part of our charter; the room is large, being twenty feet ſquare.</p>
            <p>The 8th—The ſun ſhines in our room, the firſt time we have ſeen him for ſix weeks, as we could not have any reflections from his rays in our other apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on account of the room fronting the north, and only a window in front.</p>
            <p>On the 11th—Clear and cold. Mr. Murray gave ſome directions about our room, to make it more comfortable, and thinks we ſhall be obliged to ſtay all winter; which, under the ſituation of Captain Brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and myſelf, as we are neither of us healthy, makes the proſpect gloomy before us; but patience in all afflictions is right, for I have no idea that they ſpring from the duſt. The priſoners have ſeveral times received clothing, and appear to have good attention paid them by Meſſrs. Murray and Prentiſs, but the poor creatures being ſo cloſely locked up, and having nothing but benches to fit on, makes the time hang more heavy, in particular the priſoners of other rooms, as they have only a pound of freſh beef, and a pound of bread a day, without vegetables of any kind, or flour; and the beef in Canada is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to the Engliſh or American, as vegetation is

rapid after the ſnow leaves the ground, and the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle are commonly very poor in the ſpring, ſo that generally ſpeaking, the beef is made in one ſeaſon, which is not more than five months at longeſt, and tenderer fleſh was never taſted by me.

            <p>We are informed, that in October, Lieut. Col. Statia and Captain John Wood, were brought from Niagara and confined in Chamblee. The Colonel was taken at Cherry Valley, by the Indians, where a number of our troops, and the inhabitants, were inhumanly murdered; among whom were Colonel Alden, and Mrs. Dunlap, wife to the Rev. Mr. Dunlap, an aged and worthy lady. But the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance (from information) of Capt. Wood, is truly remarkable.

            <p>A propoſal of Major Rogers, to diſcover a navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable paſſage through the continent, from the Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Ocean to China, or the great Pacific Ocean, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out from Schenectady with two hundred men, well officered, and a ſufficient number of batteaus and neceſſaries for ſo great an attempt.—He propoſed to leave Schenectady in May, 1772, and aſcend the Mohawk river to Fort Stanwix; from thence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend the Wood Creek to the Oneida lake, and paſs the ſame down the Onondaga river to Oſwego, on Lake Ontario, and coaſt along the ſouthern ſhore of that lake to the poſt of Niagara; from thence tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port their boats acroſs the portage there, by the Great Falls to the river iſſuing from Lake Erie, and aſcend that river, and coaſt along the northern ſhore of Lake Erie up the river Detroit, then acroſs the ſmall lake of St. Clair, into the river Huron, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend to Lake Huron, and coaſt the weſtern ſhore of this great lake, to the Straits and ports of Michili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machinac; from thence, croſs the north end of Lake Michigan to the Green Bay, enter the Takis river, and ſtem it to the carrying place, then tranſport the batteaus acroſs the portage there to the river Oaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſoens, then purſue the courſe of this river to its junction with the Miſſiſippi, and aſcend that river to the falls of St. Anthony, where he expected to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive by the middle of September, and there paſs the firſt winter.

It being Chriſtmas day, we invited Mr. Iſaac Van Arnum and his wife, to dine with us; they are priſoners confined in another room, and were taken from their farm at New-Haven Falls, on Utter Creek, in the New-Hampſhire Grants. They had their houſe, with its furniture, grain, hay, &amp;c. all deſtroyed by fire, by the Britiſh, and are people of character. Mrs. Van Arnum's father's name is Moſes Pierſon, from Morris county, in New-Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, who ſome years ago moved from that place and ſettled on Lake Champlain.

We had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion this day, to have three gentlemen, who are priſoners, to dine with us; they are James Caſſedy, Thomas Wigan, and a Doctor Debiere, the laſt was taken from Colonel Alden's regiment at Cherry Valley, and is a French gentleman; the other two, with William Boſtwick, Gerard Cochran, and Bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maventure Fouches, are confined on ſuſpicion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enemies to the Britiſh crown.</p>

ſome abbreviated accounts of remarkable parts of the world, taken from Brooks' Univerſal Geography.</p>
            <p>CEYLON, a large iſland in the Eaſt-Indies, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between 78 and 82 degrees of eaſt longitude, and between 6 and 10 north latitude, being 250 miles in length, and 195 in breadth. In general the air is good, and the country is full of mountains; there are pleaſant valleys, but the mountains are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry high and barren. It is particularly remarkable for its plenty of cinnamon, which is all in poſſeſſion of the Dutch, who drove out the Portugueſe and u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurped the dominion of the country. The iſland is ſituated in the Indian Sea, near the ſoutheaſt coaſt of the continent of the hither India. The Dutch are poſſeſſed of all the ſea coaſt, and have ſhut up the king in the middle of the iſland, who reſides at his capital city, of Candy. There are, in ſome places, rich mines, from whence are got rubies, ſapphires, topazes, and cats eyes; the iſland abounds with all kinds of cattle, as in other parts of India: elephants are of the ſame. They have very dangerous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents and ants, which do a great deal of miſchief. The moſt remarkable tree in this iſland, is called the Tallipot, one of whoſe leaves will cover ten men and keep them from rain; they are very light and travellers carry them from place to place and keep them for tents. The inhabitants are divided into ſeveral tribes, from the nobleman down to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of matts, and all the children follow the ſame call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as their father's; nor is it lawful to marry into any other tribe. They have each a particular mark in their dreſs. Their religion is idolatry, and though they acknowledge a Supreme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

A few reflections on matters of a ſerious nature, by turns, will not be amiſs, as I am fully perſuaded of the immortality of the ſoul, and that an account muſt be rendered to our Great Lord and Maſter, of my ſtewardſhip.—The firſt and ſeveral remarks are chiefly borrowed from Antoninus, a Roman Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and are ſtiled the Meditations of Antoninus the pious—He ſays, "Let me thus ſay to myſelf every morning, that I may in every reſpect act as one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware that I may in a ſhort time depart out of life, and that if I ſhould have to do with ſome intermed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dler in other men's affairs, with an ungrateful, or inſolent, a crafty, an envious, or an unſociable, ſelfiſh man, theſe bad qualities have befallen him through ignorance of what things are really good or evil, and that by a conſtant guard over myſelf, I cannot be hurt by any of them, ſince none of them can involve me in any thing diſhonorable or deformed.</p>
            <p>I am informed that John Helmer, a corporal of our regiment, is taken priſoner and brought into Chamblee, and confined in priſon.</p>
            <p>Sabbath, 23d—Six months ſince I was taken a priſoner, and have not enjoyed a well day.</p>
            <p>28th—The coldeſt weather I ever knew; the centinels are relieved every half hour. We were permitted to dine with the gentleman whom I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned being with us a few days paſt; but are again cloſely locked, having large double doors, lined with ſheet iron, and bolts of iron, with looks ſufficient to bar againſt the moſt felonious beings that ever exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: However, one thing is ſome comfort to us; they cannot look up our tongues or thoughts, and, as the old ſaying is, every one will have his day. This we are fully ſenſible of, that if Sir Guy Carlton was commander in this place, our treatment would be very different, as no man can be more humane to

priſoners than he. I can truly ſay, that were I in a good ſtate of health, my confinement would appear trifling to what it does at preſent; ſtill I will not diſpair, and my greateſt anxiety is relative to my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed country, as our money, from every report, is reduced to a mere ſhadow in value; and ſhould it entirely fail, an impoſſibility of ſubſiſting the army muſt take place, except a foreign ſupport can be procured.</p>
            <p>Saturday, 12th—Received of Richard Murray, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> commiſſary of priſoners, nine dollars and one third, from government.</p>
            <p>Tueſday, 15th—Cloudy weather. Sent the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners ſome vegetables and tobacco, and lent the ſerjeants two dollars.</p>
            <p>Monday, 21ſt—There are in three rooms, about forty priſoners, who have communication with each other, and were yeſterday diſcovered digging thro' the wall, which is ten feet thick; they had got with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one foot of the outer part of the wall, and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on the ſecond night from the time they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected, to have made their eſcape.</p>
            <p>The city of Quebec, ſtands on an elbow, but the largeſt ſide of the town is on the river St. Lawrence, in north latitude 47 35. three hundred miles north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt of Boſton, and five hundred and fifty nine miles from New-York. It was attempted by the Engliſh in the reign of Queen Ann, but it being in a late ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the year, and wanting good pilots, they failed in their attempt, by which means ſome tranſports and ſeveral hundred ſoldiers were loſt. There are two towns, the Upper and Lower, and I judge it to be about half as large as New-York. There are both Proteſtant and Roman Catholic churches in it, and is a place of conſiderable trade; but I know of nothing remarkable in it, except the citadel, which General
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:027681_0086_0FD5DA4FB17C7CD0"/>
Haldiman is fortifying; and I am informed he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining the ground to a conſiderable diſtance out of the town, by which means large quantities of powder may be put in order to blow up an army, in caſe of an attempt to ſtorm, and the garriſon will ſuſtain no harm: it can contain ten thouſand men and proviſions for ſeven years—So much for Britiſh information. I am of opinion it is a ſtrong fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as nature has done a great deal towards ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring its ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Friday, 25th—Cold, hazy weather.

MADAGASCAR, is ſuppoſed to be the largeſt iſland in the world, ſituated between 43 and 51 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of eaſt longitude, and between 12 and 26 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of ſouth latitude, 300 miles ſoutheaſt of the continent of Africa, and is about one thouſand miles in length, from north to ſouth, and generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two and three hundred miles broad: it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds in cattle, fiſh, fowl, and all manner of animals and vegetables that are to be found on the continent of Africa. There are a great variety of hills and valleys, and is well watered with rivers and ſprings; nor does there want for good harbours: and yet, not any European nation has thought it worth while to plant colonies there, it producing no merchandize that will bear the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of ſo long a voyage, except negroes, which are purchaſed there as well as on the continent. There are alſo white men, and a tawny generation upon the coaſt, who are ſuppoſed to be deſcended, from the Arabs, from their language and religious rites, having a mixture of Mahometaniſm, Judaiſm, and Paganiſm; but they have no moſques or tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or any ſtated worſhip. The country is divided among a great many petter ſovereigns, to whom the ſeamen that touch there, give the title of kings and princes, who, making war on each other as they do on the continent, ſell the priſoners for ſlaves to the ſhipping which call there, taking clothing, utenſils, and other neceſſaries in return. European pirates formerly frequently had their ſtation in the harbours of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="90" facs="unknown:027681_0088_0FD5DA5CAED79F78"/>
It was conjectured the pirates would have formed a petty ſtate in this iſland, having ſix or ſeven ſhips with them, on the northeaſt part of Madagaſcar, whither they uſed to carry in the prizes they made in the Indian Seas, and fortified the avenues to the harbour where they ſecured them. But what has become of them, is uncertain; whether they remain there or have left the iſland: but by this time it is ſuppoſed they are generally diſperſed and dead.</p>
            <p>February—A report is much talked of, that three of the members of Congreſs are gone to England to negociate a peace between that power and the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans; but the truth is not aſcertained; in fact we are ſhut up in this place ſo recluſe from the world, that we can neither hear or find out much relating to politics.</p>

            <p>Wedneſday, June 14—Cool for the time of year. A report that fifteen ſail of the line, of French, are at the mouth of the river St. Lawrence, having on board fifteen thouſand troops:—good news, if true; but I doubt it.</p>
            <p>Monday, 19th—So cold that the centinels whip their hands. A hot preſs laſt night. Some Heſſian troops arrived from Montreal to-day; they came down the river by water. A conſiderable buſtling appears, but no Jack Frenchman is any more talked of.</p>
            <p>26th—Eight fail of ſhipping arrived yeſterday
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:027681_0096_0FD5DA59F198F5E0"/>
from New-York, and of conſequence the fleet is not where it was reported to be. An American ſhip is brought in as a prize, named the Harlequin, mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing twenty-four guns (four pounders) commanded by Putman Cleves, was manned by ninety-three men, and had taken a prize laden with ſalt, and ſent her into Salem, from which port the Harlequi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſailed, and had been out five weeks, when the ſhip called the Hind, fell in with and ſoon captured her.</p>
            <p>27th—The officers and ſeamen who were taken in the Harlequin, are brought and confined in the room next to us.</p>
            <p>July 3d—Great news to day; the Quebec paper ſays, that General Clinton has taken Charleſton, in South-Carolina, with ſeven thouſand troops and three thouſand militia, without any kind of reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and the militia are all ſent home on their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roles of honor; and that Lord Cornwallis has pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated the country and taken Governor Rutledge, who is ſtiled a mock Governor. So much for that!</p>
            <p>Tueſday, 4th—Warm and ſultry. It being the anniverſary of our four year's Independence, I gave the priſoners two gallons of rum. We had all the gentlemen to take a glaſs of wine with us, and had ſeveral good toaſts, which we have a right to drink under locks and keys. This evening a priſoner is brought in, who was taken at the iſle of Aux Noix; he ſays he had come to join the king; his name is Havilan. An old gentleman by the name of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew Conner, who was taken from Cherry Valley, in the month of November, 1788, obtained liberty to return home on account of being exchanged; he got a releaſe from the Indians laſt fall by paying ten dollars, and was brought to this place, and has ever ſince been under cloſe confinement; Mr. Conner is above ſeventy years of age, by his account: four o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:027681_0097_0FD5DAD234CC4410"/>
aged men who were taken from their farms al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt two years ago, are permitted to return home; their names are George Wents, George Weaver, Peter Suts, and William Henderſon. Lieutenant Maynor, who was taken at Cobus Kill, in the ſpring of 1778, embarked this day for New-York. He has been on parole in this town ever ſince he was taken: but remember, when he was brought to town General Carlton commanded; or, by the life of Pharoah, had old Frederick had the command, he muſt have looked twelve months at leaſt through the grates. One thing is a comfort—he will not live always; and I judge, ſhould he and old Jau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard and Miſplet, in particular, meet in another world, there will be ſcratching work.</p>
            <p>13th.—Several tranſports ſailed for New-York.—More news, and that is, that General Waſhington has had a battle in Jerſey, and has loſt almoſt his whole army. From a ſmall calculation of accounts publiſhed in the Britiſh Quebec Gazettes, the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans have loſt all their generals in a twelve month paſt, and one hundred thouſand men. I wonder they are not aſhamed of ſuch glaring falſhoods. We are informed that Lieut. Maynor is detected in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king private letters with him, and the map of the Quebec garriſon and will be brought back and put in irons.</p>
            <p>22d.—The report of Lieutenant Maynor, like all other accounts, proves to be falſe. A German ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier who belonged to Capt. Finks company, in our regiment, came this day to ſee me. He deſerted from Fort Stanwix on the 22d of laſt May, and thirty-one more of the Garriſon, with their arms and accoutrements. Our people and ſome Indians purſued the party that deſerted, and overtook them croſſing Gooſe Creek, when they fired and killed
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:027681_0098_0FD5DAD58132CB10"/>
fourteen of the deſerters; the remainder got to Buck's Iſland, except two, who are ſuppoſed to have been loſt and periſhed in the woods. He ſays they blamed Lieut. Col. Vandyke.</p>
            <p>July 20.—So cool as to have flights of ſnow.</p>
            <p>23d.—Still cool. One year ſince being taken a priſoner, and conſidering the ſtate of health I was in when taken, and ever ſince, with the treatment I have met with, by ſuffering ſo long a confinement with my brother officers, contrary to the manner in which the Britiſh officers are uſed, makes the time diſagreeable and weariſome indeed; but why ſhould I repine?—Rather let me conſider in what a ſtate death ſhall find me, relating to the ſoul; obſerve the ſhortneſs of life, and the vaſt emenſity of the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and enſuing duration; and in every thing that is juſt and lawful be inured to attempt, even what I may diſpair of executing; alway<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> remembering how like a ſtranger is he who is ſurpriſed at any thing which may happen in life, and not form deſigns as if my exiſtence here was for a thouſand years. Death hangs over me while I live, and while I may become good. Theſe ſentiments flow from a heart of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to my righteous God, who will ſee me, my fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low officers, and all who are contending for their juſt liberties, righted, together with the poor pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, and all ſufferers in ſo good a cauſe.</p>
            <p>A few days ago, two Britiſh ſhips, the Wolf and Hind, were in chace of an American privateer, when the Wolf ſtruck a rock at the mouth of the river and ſtove all to pieces; the Hind ſaved the crew, in doing which, it is ſaid ſhe loſt both her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>les, but throwing out her ſpring cable, the chains catched to a rock and brought up the Hind, or ſhe muſt alſo have been loſt. A German Lieutenant, by the name of George Kreſs, viſited us to day, and gave

as a preſent four bottles of wine, and a dollar to the boy; he was taken by the Americans at Trenton. Philip Lanſing, Stephen Tuthill, and John Roſs, were all on a viſit yeſterday to our room and treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with ſome good wine<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> indeed we are in gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude bound to ſay, that a number of reſpectable gentlemen have frequently paid us their viſits, and made us preſents.</p>
            <p>Auguſt 15.—A report that one hundred Germans have deſerted. An American prize named the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle was brought in to-day. Three gentlemen viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, two of whom were a Col. Mann and his ſon, and the other a Mr. Smith, from the Engliſh Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and is a lieutenant in Rogers's rangers. Young Mr. Mann ſays that he is a captain in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond battalion of loyal Americans, and reports, that before he left New-York, General Kniphauſen, with a body of ſeven thouſand troops, landed in Elizabeth-Town, from Staten Iſland, and in a few days was joined by General Clinton, from Charleſton, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout nine o'clock at night began a march againſt the Americans, drove them ſeventeen miles, and bayo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neted a number of the militia: General Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's army conſiſted of only four thouſand men, therefore he made no kind of regiſtance, but retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Pompton. Mr. Mann, ſays he was in the party, and on their return burnt a ſmall village, with about thirty houſes, but cannot recollect the name of the place. From what we can learn, I believe it to be true that Springfield in Jerſey, is burnt; but no more of this ſtory is worth hearing.</p>
            <p>Three of the officers of the Eagle, and ſeventy-three ſeamen, are brought and confined in priſon. Two officers of a prize called the Jack, and thirty men, are alſo locked up. Our family encreaſes faſt. We have the liberty to walk in the yard by day.</p>

An account in the Gazette, that a number of French ſhips of war are taken on the coaſt, off Rhode Iſland, and five thouſand troops; and alſo, that General Waſhington was a few weeks paſt, alive, and has had a battle at the White Plains, and is cut all to pieces:—the old ſtory over again. I am not ſo much concerned about the Britiſh ſword as I am about the continental famine, as no news can be obtained how it goes with old Congreſs paper caſh.

            <p>JERUSALEM, an ancient and famous town in Aſia. The old city being ruined, the Emperor A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drian built a new city near the ruins of ancient Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem; it was taken by the Perſians in 614, and by the Siracens in 636; and in 1099, it was retaken by the Latins, who founded a new kingdom, which laſted eighty-eight years, under nine kings. Saladin, king of Egypt and Syria, got poſſeſſion of it in 1187; the Turks drove away the Siracens in 1227, and have kept poſſeſſion of it ever ſince; they call it Eleons, that is, the Holy City. It is now inhabited by Turks, Arabs, Jews and Chriſtians. It ſtands on a high rock, with ſteep aſcents on every ſide, except the north; it is ſurrounded with valleys, encompaſſed
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:027681_0102_0FD5DB266D9BEB28"/>
with mountains, and at preſent is about three miles in circumference, and includes Mount Calvary, which was formerly without the wall. The only thing which renders it conſiderable, is the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort of pilgrims. The church of the holy ſepulchre, which the pilgrims come to viſit, is a large ſtructure, with a round nave, which has no light but what comes through the top; the dome is covered with lead on the outſide, and with cedar within. The opening of the dome is cloſed with wire, to hinder the birds from coming into the church; in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the nave, and directly under the opening of the dome, is the holy ſepulchre, which is placed in a chapel whoſe door is three feet high and two feet broad, and is ſo ſmall that it will hold but three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, on their knees, at once; at the entrance on the right hand, is the place where the body of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was laid; the table which he was laid on at firſt, is two feet and an half from the pavement, which is now covered with white marble, becauſe the Chriſtians who came to view it were all for car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying away a ſmall bit. This chapel is cut out of the rock, and there are three holes in the roof to let out the ſmoke of the lamps, which are forty-four in number, and always kept burning; the whole is covered with white marble, both within and without, and on the outſide, there are ten fine co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns of the ſame; it is covered with a platform, the middle of which is exactly above the three holes, and forms a ſmall dome ſix feet in heighth, covered with lead and ſupported with twelve columns of por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyry, placed by pairs on the platform, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſix arches, having three lamps under each. Before the gates of the ſepulchre is a ſilver lamp, ſo large that two men cannot fathom it; and ſhall only further write, that every year on good Friday, all

parts of our Saviour's paſſion are ſolemnized and acted: they firſt have a ſermon, and then every one takes a lighted taper in his hand, with crucifixes and other things to begin the proceſſion; and among the crucifixes there is one as large as the life, exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well done, being crowned with thorns and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmeared with blood; they firſt viſit the pillar of flagellation, next the priſon, afterwards the altar of the diviſion of Chriſt's garments; then they advance to the chapel of deriſion, and from thence to Mount Calvary, leaving their ſhoes at the bottom of the ſtairs; here is two altars, one where our Lord was ſuppoſed to be nailed to the croſs, and another where it was erected, and where they ſet up the crucified image, which finiſhes the ceremony, only they pull out the nails, take down the body, and wrap it in a winding-ſheet, and return it again to the place from whence it was taken. The whole is done with great ſolemnity; and here is ſeen the cleft rock which was made by the earthquake, when our Saviour expired.</p>
            <p>What agreeable leiſure does he procure to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who takes no notice of what others ſay, do or intend, but attends to this only, that his own actions be juſt and holy. How vain is it to be ſolicitous for a ſurviving fame; he conſiders not that each one of thoſe who remember him muſt die, and ſo muſt his ſucceſſor, till at laſt this remembrance will be extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed: therefore contentment without repining, is the criterion under which all our actions ſhould be ſhaped; for admitting a brilliant figure is made by ſome under pompous titles and great eſtates, there is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

expect death, which is a diſſolution that muſt be; it is natural, and nothing natural can be evil. How important it is, to ſeaſon the paſſions of a child or youth, in particular, with devotion; for it ſeldom dies in a mind which has received an early tincture of it; though it may ſeem extinguiſhed for a while by the cares of the world, the heat of youth, or alurements of vice, it generally breaks out and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers itſelf again, as ſoon as diſcretion, conſideration, age or misfortunes, have brought the perſon to himſelf; the fire may be covered or overlaid, but cannot be entirely quenched and ſmothered.</p>

                  <p>It would be needleſs to enumerate the many inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents which have happened to me ſince being taken a captive from Fort Stanwix, and would be too lengthy for a letter; let it ſuffice, that through God's bleſſing, I am far more comfortable, as to a ſtate of health, than heretofore I have been; ſtill my conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is much impaired, but muſt ſay I enjoy a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity of mind, conſidering the ſituation I am in; as for ſome reaſon the commander in chief of this place has thought it proper, ever ſince I was brought here, to keep me under cloſe confinement, with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other American officers; and it is very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain when we may meet with a liberation, although we have often encouragement from Richard Murray, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> commiſſary of priſoners, who has, with Mr. Prentiſs, the provoſt maſter, treated us with a great degree of humanity. I wiſh you and Mr. Noah Marſh, to remember, that I entruſted the education of my little boy to your care, which I ſhall expect will be ſtrictly complied with. If no good ſchool is at Weſtfield, ſend him abroad, let the coſt be what it will; I ſhall never, ſhould I live to return to my native home, conſider you as my friends, if you neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the great point of educating my child. This I ſuppoſe may be depended on, that it muſt be a long time before I do return, if ever; as the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of this place ſeems not inclined to pay any attention towards the exchange of priſoners, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:027681_0107_0FD5DB1E050ED0A8"/>
though it would not be amiſs for Mr. Noah Marſh to go to General Waſhington in my behalf, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to negociate an exchange, and I truſt a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will not want aſking to go with him. I want ſome alterations made relative to my temporal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; but the great diſtance I am from home, and the uncertainty of matters of conſequence reaching you, I ſhall omit an attempt, and truſt in a provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential agency to ſupport me through thoſe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which are before me, and appear almoſt inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable: and will never diſpair of his goodneſs. I am anxious about my aged and honorable mother, who I fear is no more; and if her glaſs is run, and ſhe has finiſhed the toilſome race of this earthly pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, may ſhe be triumphing in plaudits of hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujahs to the Great Three in One, forever, and forever: but if ſhe ſtill ſurvives, lay theſe lines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her, and ſay I feel for her infirmities, which ſhe much labored under when I laſt ſaw her, and can do no more than lay the perſon who was the means of giving me birth, cloſe to my heart; and if ever I forget her, may my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.

            <p>Thurſday, 28th.—Mrs. Van Arnum was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a ſon, and his name is called Frederick Haldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; ſhe is ſtill in priſon, but I imagine the poor little fellow will not get a new coat. Three veſſels arrived yeſterday, one from Jamaica, and one that our people had taken, which was retaken again, with the veſſel from Boſton that took her—Bad luck.</p>
            <p>A gentleman from the Grants, by the name of Holt, paid us a viſit to-day, with our old friend John Roſs, and made us a preſent of a bottle of wine.</p>
            <p>Six priſoners were taken from provoſt to ſaw wood for Meſſrs. Murray and Prentiſs. Two Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Doctors viſited us; one is named John Freſlick, and has a brother with General Gates; the other gentleman's name is Frederick Santegan. We alſo had another viſit from Meſſrs. Holt and Boſtwick.—A Doctor from Montreal is confined, and is ſo frightened that he is crazy.</p>
            <p>SOUTH AMERICA, is divided into three large provinces; the firſt is MEXICO, bounded by the Gulph of Mexico on the northeaſt, by Terra Firma on the ſoutheaſt, and by the Pacific Ocean on the ſouthweſt, being upwards of two thouſand miles long and ſix hundred broad; the higheſt mountains are near the Pacific Ocean, and many of them volca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes.</p>
            <p>PERU is about fifteen hundred miles in length, and in many places, three hundred in breadth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Andes and South Sea. It never rains where the country is level, although the higheſt

mountains are conſtantly covered with ſnow, and there are ſeveral volcanos which burn continually: here the number of gold and ſilver mines are prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous, as well as all other riches; and hither, from the mountain called Potoſi alone, which lies in 22 degrees of ſouth latitude, there were drawn two thouſand millions of pieces of eight, the firſt forty years they were wrought; there are alſo ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones. Thoſe who travel over the Andes where they are paſſable, find it ſo cold that they are often frozen to death: and if they are aware of a ſtorm approaching, which does not laſt long at a time, they ſave themſelves by killing their horſes and getting into their bellies: the jeſuits bark is brought from here; the angle worm is as long as a man's arm, and thick as his thumb; that bats are ſo large as to ſuck the blood of beaſts, and even men aſleep; a bird that is called the Condor, ſo large that it will meaſure fifteen or ſixteen feet with its wings, and will take a large Buck up into a tree, and ſometimes children of ten or eleven years of age, although they are not plenty. The capital city now, is Lima, and both Mexico and Peru are under Spaniſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the land next the ſea is high, the Sierras or mountains beyond which, run parallel to the former, are ſtill higher, and the Andes beyond theſe, are the higheſt mountains in the world. The land next the ſea is for the moſt part a barren deſert, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſome valleys into which the ſtreams are turned from the hills. It is bounded by Popayan on the north, by the mountains of Andes or Cordeleras, which ſeparate it from the country of the Amazons and Paragua on the eaſt, by Chilli, and La Plata on the ſouth, and by the Pacific Ocean on the weſt. They have a kind of animal, that has ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of European ſheep, but larger, and uſed to carry burdens, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

BRAZIL, a large country of South-America, with the title of a principality, which is given to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive heir of the crown of Portugal; the moſt eaſtern part of South America is comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this name, and lies between the Equinoctial line and the Tropic of Capricorn, being about fifteen hundred and ſixty miles in length, and one thouſand in breadth; but meaſuring along the coaſt, it is near two thouſand miles in length, and is bordered with mountains that open from time to time and form good harbours, where veſſels may lie with ſafety. It was diſcovered in 1500, by chance; for Alvazez, a Portugueſe, was forced on it by a ſtorm, and the kings of Portugal have continued maſters of it ever ſince. When the United Provinces revolted, they drove away the Spaniards, and the Portugueſe in turn drove away the Dutch. The waters in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral are very good, and the ſoil fertile. There comes more ſugar from there, than all the reſt of the world beſides; it produces tobacco, indian corn, ſeveral ſorts of fruits, and medicinal drugs: the cattle brought from Europe grow very well, and all kinds of animals are found here, the ſame as in Europe; the goats are very plenty, and plant out centinels when they go to feed, and on an alarm of an enemy approaching, they run and get into clefts of rocks, and turn their heads outward and butt at their enemy ſo as to keep it off; the partridges are as tame as the dunghill fowls, and can be called up as naturally. The three provinces of Mexico, Peru and Brazil, extend along the ſea ſhore not much ſhort of ſix thouſand miles, and are from two hundred to one thouſand broad. Peru is bounded on the Cordeleras, which ſeparate it from the country of the Amazons, and Brazil is bounded on Paragua and the country of the Ama<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>From the Spectator.</hi>—A ſtate of temperence, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety and juſtice, without devotion, is a cold, life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, inſipid condition of virtue, and is rather to be ſtiled philoſophy than religion. Devotion opens the mind to great conceptions, and fills it with more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime ideas than any that are to be met with in the moſt exalted ſcience, and at the ſame time warms and agitates the ſoul more than ſenſual pleaſure. It has been obſerved by ſome writers, that man is more diſtinguiſhed from the animal world, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, than by reaſon; as ſeveral brute creatures diſcover in their actions ſomething like a faint glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering of reaſon, though they betray in no ſingle circumſtance of their behaviour any thing that bears affinity to devotion; it is certain the propenſity of the mind to religious worſhip, the natural tendency of the ſoul to fly to ſome ſuperior being for ſuccor

in danger and diſtreſs, the gratitude to an inviſible ſuperintendant, which ariſes in us upon receiving any extraordinary and unexpected good fortune, the acts of love and admiration with which the thoughts of men are ſo wonderfully tranſported in meditating on the divine perfection, and the univerſal concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all the nations under Heaven in the great article of adoration, plainly ſhew that devotion, or religious worſhip, muſt be the effect of tradition from ſome firſt founder of mankind, or that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the natural right of reaſon, or that it proceeds from an inſtinct implanted in the ſoul itſelf.</p>

            <p>In about an hour after we had ſigned our paroles, the maſter of the veſſel we were to have gone in to the Iſle of Orleans, ſent us word that the veſſel was aground, which delayed our ſetting out until ſun-ſet, at which time all the American priſoners were marched from provoſt to the water ſide, and put on board a gundaloe. The tide not being high enough, we were obliged to ſtay on board in a very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſituation, the night being extremely cold;
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:027681_0118_0FD5DB0AF714E808"/>
and the next morning, the tide ſtill not riſing high enough, beſides being hard frozen up with ice, we received orders to return back again to our old quarters, the provoſt: and carriols being provided for the officers (as it was good ſledding) we rode in ſtate to Mr. Ritchey's, our old taylor, and drank a glaſs of wine; and from thence to the old father of the faithful, Miles Prentiſs, where we had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Dinner and plenty of wine, with a jovial frolic, and back to our old quarters, as rich as the Mogul of Indoſtan, to think we had been to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and back again, which was near one hundred rods.</p>
            <p>2d—We had a viſit from Col. Peters, Capt. M'Fall, Capt. Sherwood, and Capt. Jones, and had a long ſtory to tell of our yeſterday's journey and voyage.</p>
            <p>Tueſday, 5th.—We ſeem to reſume our former times: here is a grunt, and there a complaint of back-ache, head-ache, and a great many aches. A French regular major was brought to town yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. Mr. Prentiſs had a niece named Frances, a genteel young lady, married to an old fellow, named Thompſon.</p>
            <p>Tueſday, 12th.—A poor unfortunate man, who belonged to the artillery, ſhot himſelf (ſuppoſed wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully) yeſterday. I have lent the priſoners a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſum of money; beſides, never has a week, I imagine, paſſed, but I have ſent them vegetables, tobacco, and ſuch neceſſaries as poſſibly could be ſpared by me, and for which I now ſtand accounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to government and private gentlemen, for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies borrowed, which the priſoners have pledged themſelves to be reſponſible to each other for. Capt. Brownſon and Lieutenant Dunning, in particular, have been liberal to the priſoners, there being ſome
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:027681_0119_0FD5DAF2DC7D84A0"/>
confined from the regiment to which they belonged, and from the other corps of the American armies.</p>
            <p>December 29. The weather has been exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly cold. The main river is ſhut up, which, from information, has not happened in ſeven years.</p>
            <p>January 12, 1781. This afternoon ſome ſleighs, or (as the French call them) carriols, came and took the priſoners' baggage, and all the priſoners, except the officers, to go on to the Iſle of Orleans.</p>
            <p>January 13. This morning ſome ſleighs came for us, with Canadians to drive us; we left our room about nine o'clock, and paſſed about two miles on the ice, to the iſle of Orleans, where we over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the priſoners who left the provoſt yeſterday; they are all ordered to go on board a ſhip called the Cancer, at Patrick's Hole. The roads being badly beaten, and having but one horſe to our carriol, and three on board, renders the travelling very dull. About twelve o'clock we arrived at a pariſh called Saint Lawrence, or as the French pronounce it, Cileroy, where we halted for about an hour, and had a ſight of the Canadian houſes, which look well on the outſide, but within are not altogether ſo comely. We next went to St. John's, where we reſted again; and after leaving the village of Cile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy, ſcarcely ſaw a houſe until we came to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of St. John's; indeed, from the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation I can gather, the whole province of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada is ſettled in village pariſhes, and near the churches are generally the main part of the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, or within the compaſs of a mile and an half, or thereabouts, each way, although ſcattering houſes are to be ſeen the whole diſtance on the road; but it is certain they ſettle thicker in pariſhes, than in the ſtates, and their houſes make not an unreſpectable appearance conſidering the people are all hard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borers,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:027681_0120_0FD5DB45B75E8F80"/>
and I believe the whole province are under tenantable ſeniors, or large land-holders, who are thus ſtiled, although their taxes are very light. The people appeared to ſhew every mark of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to us who were priſoners; but our not being able to ſpeak a word of French made it ſingular to us, and likely to them, as the Engliſh who are livers in the province of Canada, can ſpeak French to a proverb. We did not tarry long at this place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſetting out, and the road being heavy, made it dark before our arrival at St. Francis (the French ſpell it <hi>Francois</hi>) a houſe in a pariſh the fartheſt end of the Iſle of Orleans, twenty ſeven miles, or nine leagues, from Quebec. We all lodged, drivers and priſoners, in one houſe together, where, for the firſt, we ſaw and eat a ſupper of their ſoup, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Sabbath, 14th. Lieut. Dunning and myſelf were quartered in a houſe, the owner of which was named Muſo. Our new ſituation, not being able to hold any kind of converſation with the inhabitants, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the intenſe coldneſs of the weather (the like all of us confeſſed never to have beheld or felt before) does not ſeem to alter our comfort any great for the better, as it is almoſt impoſſible to go far from the houſe; but there is this to ſay, we are not under lock and key.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday, January 25. The firſt of receiving any proviſions from government, and that in part. The French or Canadians, have to every houſe a ſtove, which is conſtantly kept with a good fire in the winter, and the heat of the ſtove againſt the glaſs windows, forms a contraſt between heat and cold; for the inſide of the pane being kept warm, and the froſt on the outſide, in ſuch extreme cold nights as are in this country, forms an ice on the pane in the morning nearly double the thickneſs of
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:027681_0121_0FD5DAE0ABC23988"/>
the glaſs; and their rule to know in the morning the degree of cold on the night paſt, is by the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ice on the glaſs windows of their ſtove room; and the keeneſt and cleareſt nights will form the greateſt ice, and particles which will appear looſe on the outſide of the ice, exactly reſembling ſnow.</p>
            <p>On the 17th, Capt. M'Fall, who is paroled from Boſton, arrived at the next houſe to live. I have begun to endeavor, as far as my abilities will admit, to gain what knowledge I can in ſpeaking the French language, and am of opinion, were there no Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh to be ſpoken among the Engliſh officers and my brother priſoners, I could readily gain a knowledge of the language, as I have a dictionary and gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar; but it is ſaid the Canadians ſpeak very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, although not quite ſo bad as a Mr. Perſons, whom I found in this place, on parole from Boſton, for he ſpeaks ſix words of Engliſh and one of French; although he has undertaken to learn us the language. We have for our commander a Capt. M'Kenno, a Scotchman, who is vaſtly particular, as we muſt be in our quarters every evening by nine o'clock; it ſhews he is a man of authority.</p>
            <p>February 13. David Griſwold, from the ſhip Cancer, came to live with and cook for Mr. Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and myſelf, and informs us that the priſoners on board of ſaid ſhip ſuffer very much, particularly by ſickneſs; two that were ſeamen are dead.</p>
            <p>We have paid the Parſon of this pariſh ſeveral vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> he appears to be a man of extraordinary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and is an aged gentleman; his name is Duran—he ſpeaks ſlow, but very proper Engliſh, as he has it all grammatically—he is a man ſaid to have great education, but appears droll in his outward conduct, and I think is fond of a glaſs of wine, by the looks of his noſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="124" facs="unknown:027681_0122_0FD5DAEFC816FBE0"/>
February 24. The people from what I can learn, are making preparations for a great feaſt of three days, previous to Lent Sabbath.</p>
            <p>25th. This morning the French have begun their feaſt; it is ſtiled <hi>monja groe,</hi> or great feaſt: they viſit each other and appear very generous, which is a common characteriſtic of the inhabitants, generally ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>Monday morning, 26th. The inhabitants, from the oldeſt to the youngeſt, viſit one another, and every houſe is kept open for the reception of friends; they have their dances promiſcuouſly, without the formality of young people aſſembling by themſelves: the father, mother, ſon and daughter, will be in a room and dance with a great degree of harmony; although the young people will moſt commonly have a little aſſembly by themſelves in the after part of the day; but from the nature of their rejoicings, they are taught to regard this part as rather a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious conviviality<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than for the mere form of what is vulgarly termed frolicking.</p>
            <p>Tueſday, 27th. This day has finiſhed the great feaſting among the French, for this part of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and is the greateſt in the year. How far their ſuperſtitions may be thought by thoſe of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent perſuaſion, to extend, is unknown to me; but I can ſay that nothing has tranſpired in the eye of my obſervation, which I ſhould ſuppoſe ought to be condemned with that rancor which many are pleaſed to exerciſe towards the Roman Catholics; although I believe they carry many of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances to too great a length of enthuſiaſm; not only temporal but ſpiritual: particularly in this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, as the inhabitants, eſpecially the males, are deſtitute of education, and of conſequence are vaſtly ignorant, ſpeaking within bounds from every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:027681_0123_0FD5DAF737C33520"/>

            <p>February 28. This day Lent commences, which is in commemoration of the forty days our Saviour faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the mount. The people are not allowed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> eat any meat nor ſoup that hath been made of it; eggs, fiſh, butter, cheeſe, &amp;c. may be uſed; but no kind of fleſh, except a perſon is ſick.</p>
            <p>The weather is cold, and beyond any conception I had ever formed; for being formerly in Albany, Schenectady, and Fort Stanwix, I thought I had felt ſevere weather, but this is as far ſurpaſſing Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany, as Albany (in my opinion) does in a common run of weather, Philadelphia, or ſtill further ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The drifts of ſnow around houſes, barns, &amp;c. are in ſome places from ſix to twelve feet deep, and on a common level five feet. Their cattle of every kind are kept in cloſe houſes, and water is carried to them, from the horſe down to the ſheep. The cattle are fed on ſtraw, made from wheat, oats, barley, and pea vines, and what I have ſeen, a mere trifle of hay is in their barns, to what is made uſe of in the States. The men appear to ſmoke a great deal, and live eaſy in the winter.</p>
            <p>Saturday, March 10. This evening, about ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven o'clock, Capt. M'Kenno, our commandant, Capt. Frazier, and a Lieut. Robertſon, came to my quarters and I was awaked from ſleep, and heard the following important information:—"That four gentlemen had that day paid Capt. M'Kenno a viſit, and ſaid that the day before they left Quebec they dined with general Haldiman, who had ever appear-to keep news cloſe to himſelf, but then ſaid he had
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:027681_0124_0FD5DAF5ACC7FD40"/>
ſtraight accounts from New-York, that two Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican generals, thirty colonels, and four thouſand of the beſt of General Waſhington's army, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted and joined Sir Henry Clinton, and that the remaining part of the American army would undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly follow the example—that the French, finding the ſituation of the Americans, had taken Boſton in the name of the French king, until the debt due from America to France ſhould be paid." Captain M'Kenno adviſed us immediately to write to Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Haldiman for protection, under a promiſe of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming faithful ſubjects to the crown of Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; he was however fearful whether we ſhould receive pardon; he ſeemed to feel for Capt. Brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, on account of his being an aged and venerable looking man, that he ſhould be hung; but did not ſeem ſo much to lament the ſate of Smith, Dunning, and myſelf. I muſt confeſs that after the gentlemen were gone I had very ſerious reflections on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; and its being handed to me in ſuch a manner, &amp; at a late hour of the night, with the reflection of the continental money being near or quite dead, added to the gloom of the proſpect; and I can truly ſay, that if ever I felt for my country, it was at this criſis; and it would ſwell a volume to mention the number of different opinions and reflections which preſented themſelves to view on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>Tueſday, March 13. I am informed Serjeant Deforeſt died on board the ſhip Cancer, on the 15th of February. Hoſea M'Farland and Moſes Bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle died about the firſt of this month; and an old man by the name of Odle Squire is alſo dead:</p>
            <p>My brother officers and myſelf have had a confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the late news, which the Quebec papers teem with a confirmation of, and which is in every Canadian's mouth; but we agree it cannot be true,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:027681_0125_0FD5DAEE84900B88"/>
and to the honor of Capt. Brownſon, he appears to ſuppoſe it a mere bubble of noiſe without founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but I muſt confeſs I have my fears that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing uncommon has turned up.</p>
            <p>April 8. Raw, cold, windy day from northeaſt; the wind generally blows up or down the River St. Lawrance, which ſets near a northeaſt courſe. The inhabitants from each houſe took this day ſome green hemlock boughs to maſs with them, which receives ſeveral ceremonies, by being ſprinkled with holy water, and ſuch manner of conſecration as is in their church diſcipline, which I hope to be more able to explain; let it ſuffice, that the uſe of thoſe boughs are to take to their reſpective homes, where they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> generally fixed over head to the beam of the floor, or the like places, which are handy to reach in caſe of a thunder ſtorm, as the boughs are prepared and made holy according to their ideas, they fling a twig of the hemlock into the fire in caſe of a heavy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of thunder, and the ſmoke of the twig will keep the lightening from ſtriking the houſe, as they ſay it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> holy, and that thunder is of the Devil's permiſſion, and cannot ſtrike or harm any thing that is made ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their church.</p>
            <p>April 13. The wind hard at N. E. and ſnow all laſt night and to day. The young women went laſt night to maſs; two of them ſet in the church toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for one hour, and then are relieved by two more<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the others ſtay in the parſon's houſe, and thus continue the night through. They hold it in commemoration of the evening on which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was betrayed.</p>
            <p>April 14. We meaſured the depth of the ſnow in the woods to-day, and find it three feet and an half on a level. Capt. M'Fall, the Captain of the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, and myſelf, went to Cileroy after proviſions, as
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:027681_0126_0FD5DADA11481280"/>
we have forty four days due, and have lived the whole time on the inhabitants, and are alſo denied any further ſupply in money from government. We dined with ſome German officers, who treated us with a great degree of politeneſs: they are bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leted at ſaid place with about one hundred men.</p>
            <p>26th. The river St. Lawrance appoſite where we live, is ſuppoſed to be about five miles in width, and the ſhip channel is near this ſhore. Oppoſite to us, about two miles from the main land, is an iſland called Madam, where the geeſe on their way to Newfoundland and the Bay of Hudſon ſtop to reſt, and among ſeveral other iſlands in the river. We went in company with Capt. M'Fall laſt evening on to ſaid iſland to hunt geeſe; but they appeared to know themſelves in danger by coming near ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> when the tide was up; for, as I before obſerved, the tide ebbs and flows a great heighth, and the banks are of a gradual ſlope, ſo that it leaves almoſt or quite half a mile between high and low water marks; high water would come within ſmall gun-ſhot of the woods, and let it be ever ſo dark, windy and rough, the geeſe would keep a certain diſtance from ſhore round the whole iſland, which is at leaſt two miles long, ſo that they were quite out of gun-ſhot, and at low water they would feed on the ſhore in fair ſight of us, but at too great a diſtance to touch them, and of conſequence we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned as we went.</p>
            <p>April 29. The method of the people of this country reſpecting the ſick, is as follows—When the miniſter is ſent for to viſit a ſick perſon (particularly if the patient is ſuppoſed to be dangerous) the prieſt dreſſes himſelf in a white ſurplice and is accompanied by one of the pariſh, who carries a ſmall bell which is rung oppoſite every houſe the miniſter paſſes, on
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:027681_0127_0FD5DB47D426EB98"/>
which the whole family immediately turn out of doors and fall on their knees to prayer, with a ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing devotion full of fervency for the recovery of the perſon he is viſiting.</p>
            <p>May 1. The ice at Quebec is ſuppoſed to be broken up, as the river is very full of large cakes which float over a reef of rocks the other ſide of the Iſle of Madam, and make a clattering ſound, like a wheeled carriage going over a quantity of ſtones with great force.</p>
            <p>5th. The firſt ſwallow that has been ſeen, and is ſomething remarkable too, as there is a great deal of ſnow on the ground in banks, though the fields are moſtly clear. A few people have begun to ſow their wheat.</p>
            <p>May 10. The wind has blown hard from the northeaſt for ſeveral days, and the ſnow banks de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe but ſlow. The inhabitants allow the ſpring to be later than common. I computed the tide this morning to riſe eighteen feet perpendicular, and ſome of the gentlemen ſuppoſed near or quite twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. A large ſnow bank that lies fair to the ſun, we to day meaſured, and find it five feet deep; but it has been a drift that was probably fifteen feet deep in the greateſt depth of winter.</p>
            <p>The farmers are generally ſowing their wheat, which is done in a manner uncommon in the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican States. The land in this country is level and clear of ſtone, and all the plows that have come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my notice, have wheels to them, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence would be uſeleſs in ſtony ground; they guage their plows to cut about four inches deep, and lay their furrows from ſeven to nine inches wide, and turn the turf over as flat as poſſibly can be done, ſo that the fields appear exceeding level. The plowing I am informed is done in the month of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:027681_0128_0FD5DB3578FC9B98"/>
and lays until ſpring, when they ſow their wheat without further manuring of any kind, and after the wheat is ſown, they have a light three-ſquare wooden-tooth harrow, much of the ſize of the American corn harrow, and is quite eaſy for the draught of one horſe only, and with this they go the ſame way the ground is laid over, and ſcarcely more than twice in a place; they make no preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to croſs-harrowing; indeed from what I can ſee in their way of putting their ſeed in the ground, it is a ſtrife who ſhall ſow and cover the moſt buſhels in a day, and not who ſhall do it beſt. I have walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed over their fallows and find a great deal of their wheat entirely uncovered. They will ſow from twenty to forty buſhels, and I judge they do not ſow more than a buſhel to an acre. The land is of a light gravelly marl, and I think would produce ſpontaneouſly were it put under good cultivation. Some have plowed ſword ground over this ſpring, in order to ſow.</p>
            <p>Thurſday, May 17. The people have done ſeeding their ground. A brig paſſed up the river from England; Capt. M'Kenno, and Capt. M'Fall went on board, and brought the news that ſome of the Dutch provinces had declared war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt England, and alſo, that the outward bound fleets to the Eaſt and Weſt-Indies are taken from the Engliſh by the French and Spaniards</p>
            <p>Monday, 21. The people in this country appear to go one-third of their time to public worſhip; they have had to day a proceſſion. In the firſt place they held their maſs, and the proceſſion was performed by a young man's going foremoſt carrying a croſs, which was extended ſome diſtance in the air (I ſhould ſuppoſe twelve or fifteen feet) on a pole, and the croſs was beautifully ornamented; the prieſt
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:027681_0129_0FD5DB0DACB9EBB0"/>
next followed, and after him the men and women they walked quite flow, with an apparent devotion, until they arrived at a ſmall chapel about half a mile from the church, and marched round ſaid chapel, the prieſt continuing a conſtant ceremony in a ſinging tone, and then returned to the church as they came.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday, 23. The ſame ceremonies that were performed on the 21ſt, were continued yeſterday and to-day; but I cannot learn what part of our Saviour's paſſion they celebrate, and am very much clogged in being a hiſtorian of this province, and what is written proceeds from my own amuſement.</p>
            <p>Captain M'Fall has received a letter from Col<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Peters, who mentions that commiſſioners are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the Iſle of Aux Noix, on Lake Champlain, from the United States of America, to negociate an exchange of priſoners; that the Portugueſe are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to war againſt England; that the Empreſs of Ruſſia has demanded her ſhipping, with the damages done to them, from the Engliſh; that the French had left Rhode-Iſland and landed at Cheſapeake Bay, and that the Engliſh fleet from New-York had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued them, and deſtroyed the whole French fleet; that Mr. Arnold, ſupported by General Phillips, had lately a battle in Virginia—General Sumpter is wounded, and fifteen hundred is killed and taken of the French and Americans, and thoſe who are left are gone home to hoe their tobacco.</p>
            <p>May 31. The apple-trees begin to bloom.—There has not been any rain ſince the ſnow left the ground.</p>
            <p>Tueſday, June 5. The wind is raw and cold, from the northeaſt. This evening the French fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, by appointment, their ten days praying for rain; they aſſembled about ſun-ſet every day around the ſmall chapel, and all kneeled to prayer and ſung a

pſalm; indeed for three days paſt they have kept a very ſolemn <hi>fait,</hi> as it is termed in French, or have held maſs every day, which, from what I can learn, is to commemorate the three days our Saviour lay in the earth. The tenth day after he aroſe, will be the greateſt day they can celebrate, as on that day, they hold, he aſcended up to Heaven.</p>
            <p>Capt. M'Kenno has been to Quebec, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with the diſagreeable news that the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners for an exchange of priſoners have returned back without effecting an exchange for us. I look upon myſelf as doomed to be a priſoner during the conteſt.</p>
            <p>Friday, June 8. Captain M'Kenno took his leave of us to go to Quebec, not to return again.</p>
            <p>Saturday 9. This day the French walked in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion round the chapel with their holy water; the prieſt was with them praying for rain.</p>
            <p>Tueſday, June 12. Capt. M'Fall has received ſome Engliſh papers from Quebec, which mention, that the Americans have revolted to ſuch a degree, that General Waſhington has ſcarcely a guard left him; that propoſals from Congreſs are ſent to the court of Great Britain, offering to accept of the propoſals which were made to them by the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners in the year 1778, but are refuſed: but I ſcruple it.</p>
            <p>Thurſday, 14. This day is held as Aſcenſion; but I believe every pariſh have their holy-days, and imagine they do not obſerve a particular day through the whole province; for the Church of England hold the ninth of May as Aſcenſion, yet as every pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh is named after a ſaint, ſo I believe they have their ſtanding holy time, to celebrate the different paſſions our Saviour paſſed through while on earth, or the moſt remarkable ones. A ſolemn maſs was
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:027681_0131_0FD5DB515C49E9B0"/>
kept, and about twelve o'clock the little boys, with handkerchiefs, &amp;c. fixed in the manner of flying co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, were arranged in two columns, a ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance apart; the young women were placed two by two next to the boys; a large ſtandard, with two images handſomely decorated, was carried in front of the boys, and about half way between the boys and girls, was a ſilver croſs; the young men with long white ſcarſs or ſurplices, went on to carry the holy-water and incenſe; the next was the clerk and ſingers, and then the prieſt, under a canopy carried by four men, holding a ſmall glaſs, with a ſmall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age over it crowned with thorns, the prieſt looking through the glaſs; the old and married men and women walked after, intermixed, without any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement, in order to appearance, to defend their holy proceſſion. They moved very ſlow and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn the whole way, ſinging a ſlow and ſeemingly well adapted ſound to grace the ſolemnity of their devotion, and on the boys and young women arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at the chapel, they filed off to the right and left to admit the prieſt to paſs through, falling on their knees to prayer; the miniſter, canopy, and as many married people as could, entered the chapel, where was the image, as I was informed, of the Virgin Mary, richly decorated; they continued about fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen minutes on their knees in the chapel, and thoſe who could not go in were the whole time on their knees at prayer. The prieſt then came out under the canopy as he entered, and the proceſſion return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame manner as it came to the church. The whole appeared to be conducted with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeſt devoutneſs.</p>
            <p>June 24. We who are priſoners went this day to St. John's, where was a great day of worſhip, and where their biſhop, with a number of prieſts
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:027681_0132_0FD5DB54632D0CF8"/>
and a great concouſe of people attended. On our return, my eyes never beheld the like of a ſmall cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpillar, or rather a worm. Millions of them were on the fences, graſs, and the young wheat; the ſtalks about ſunſet appear black with them, which much alarms the inhabitants, as they ſay it is a very uncommon thing for them to appear ſo thick, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they confeſs to be often troubled with ſome of a like kind; but the ſeverity of the drought, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had no rain to be of any ſervice ſince the ſnow went off, they imagine is one reaſon of there being ſo many in the graſs and wheat.</p>

            <p>The remaining part of the French Catechiſm, I have put down in full by itſelf,</p>
            <p>June 29. Yeſterday and laſt night the good hand of Providence has refreſhed this country with a plenty of rain, as there has been none worth men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning ſince laſt March. The drought has been ſo great, that nature muſt take a great change if any
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:027681_0135_0FD5DB575F59C990"/>
crops to ſignify, come to perfection. The poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants appear ſurrounded with conflicts and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as the graſshoppers bid fair to deſtroy the ſmall remaining crops, together with the worms and a ſmall inſect; but I muſt confeſs they are the moſt fervent in their prayers, that God would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede his judgments, of any people I ever ſaw. Not an evening but they gather either at the church or by a croſs, and there pray and ſing pſalms. They hold this as St. Peter's day, on which they ſay the keys of Heaven were given to him, and expect he will open the windows of Heaven and grant them ſuch bleſſings as they moſt ſtand in need of. The day is kept as holy time.</p>
            <p>July 2. This day there is a proceſſion again, and prayers for the deſtruction of the whole of the inſects.</p>
            <p>4th. Yeſterday a proceſſion, and alſo to day, for the inſects to be deſtroyed. It being the anniverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our five years independence, Capt. Brownſon, Lieut. Dunning and myſelf, ſent for Capt. M'Fall to dine with us, and ſpent the day agreeably. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Smith was unwel.</p>
            <p>6th. The peas in the garden begin to bloſſom; the wheat is earing out, and is about eighteen inches high. There is a purple coloured bug which has lately made its appearance, which like the ſavages, are ſcalping the potatoes; they appear very vora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and devour the vines of the potatoes.</p>
            <p>10th. The whole pariſh aſſembled and walked in proceſſion, to endeavor to defeat the inſects, which appear as if they would deſtroy their wheat, oars, flax, graſs, and in fact every kind of vegetable. A poor woman in this pariſh dying ſome time paſt, and not leaving a ſufficiency in caſh to redeem her from purgatory, and her huſband as is ſaid, pleading po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, took her clothes to the church, where they
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:027681_0136_0FD5DB16AAE49F10"/>
were ſold at public auction; my landlord was ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due-maſter, and his daughter bought ſome of the clothes. The vendue was conducted with an air of as much indifference, as if they were in a common frolic, and the money handed to the prieſt.</p>
            <p>There is a ſort of worm in this place called the canker, which are long and black, with white ſtreaks; and I do not remember of ever ſeeing their likeneſs in my country.</p>
            <p>We catch plenty of trout on this iſland, although they are ſmall; but are delicious food. We begin to catch pidgeons. The weather has got to be very fine, but ſome days I think are more ſuffocating than I ever experienced in Jerſey; and the days are a great length, the longeſt being fifteen hours and thirty-two minutes, in Quebec; ſixteen hours and twenty-ſix minutes, in London; and fourteen hours and fifty-two minutes, in New-York. London is in 51 degrees and 30 minutes, north latitude; Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec is in 47 degrees and 35 minutes, north latitude; and New-York, is in 41 degrees and 40 minutes, north latitude.</p>
            <p>July 25. I have lived to ſee another birth-day; and on a reflection of the apparent ſhortneſs of the time I have had an exiſtence, or the knowledge thereof; yet how many changing ſcenes have I paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and what a variety of flowers and thorns have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hecquered my path; dangers eſcaped and bleſſings innumerable received, demands my warmeſt tribute of praiſe. Doctor Young, in his remarks on the ſtriking of a clock, ſays—"The clock ſtrikes one: we take no note of time, but from its loſs. To give it then a tongue is wiſe in man." Surely if every ſtriking clock is ſo wiſely to be obſerved, what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement ought to be made on the return of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther year. But what a labyrinth of ideas muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:027681_0137_0FD5DB5EF8F50630"/>
themſelves to view in reflecting on a whole life, and that not ſpent to the end which the Great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of my exiſtence ſent me into the world for: certainly, inſtead of rejoicing, I ought to line my heart and room in mourning, for ſo long a miſſpent life.</p>
            <p>The French continue their prayers and proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for the deſtruction of the inſects. They only walk from the chapel to the church, without any particular ceremony.</p>
            <p>Friday, Auguſt 17. This day the inhabitants commence harveſting. Their wheat in common is not more than eighteen or twenty inches long; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I ſuppoſe it to be much ſhorter than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon on account of the drought; but from what I can learn, they ſuppoſe their wheat to be good that is two and two and an half feet high; and whatever was formerly raiſed from a buſhel's ſowing, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not learn but it muſt have been much more than at preſent, for the inhabitants will talk of their fathers ſelling five pecks for two and an half, and three li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres, which is a French ſhilling each livre, or about eighteen pence York, as near as I can inform myſelf.</p>
            <p>Many of the inhabitants of this place ſowed from thirty to forty buſhels of wheat, and ſcarcely expect more than their ſeed; although they ſay it is not the caſe through the province. The men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, both old and young, have their ſickles, which is the only tool they know of in this province to har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt with. To ſee the young ladies, with their mockiſons reaping away, with a merry ſong, is a fine leſſon to promote contentment; for no doubt the next Sabbath they will go to church in their ſilks, and have the chat of which has cut the moſt wheat in the week paſt. I have been ſo particular as to put down all the veſſels I have ſeen paſs up the river
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:027681_0138_0FD5DB6283BC92D0"/>
which came from ſea, and I find that on the 27th of Auguſt, 1781, there have ninety-ſix ſtout top-ſail veſſels (chiefly ſhips) gone up ſince the ice broke up in the ſpring. The people have finiſhed harveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pretty generally.</p>
            <p>Sept. 4. We petitioned General Haldiman rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to our ſituation; being deprived of money from government, and receiving no aſſiſtance from home, we are almoſt deſtitute of clothing.</p>
            <p>On the 10th Captain Brownſon received a letter from Mr. Murray, informing him that he is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed.</p>
            <p>Wedneſday, 19. Captain Brownſon being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, is exchanged, as far as I can learn in the rank of a Major; and this morning himſelf and the boy that lived with us, by the name of Griſwould, took their leave of us, to return to their native homes. Poor Smith hangs his under lip; and in fact we all I believe feel rather diſcomfited on the ſubject, altho' we are happy the Major is gone, on account of his being releaſed from his confinement, and from a wiſh that his health may be reſtored: yet we hang our harps on the willows, not being able to form a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny idea how the country whoſe proſperity we ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten are wiſhing for, is now ſituated.</p>
            <p>I again wrote a letter to my brother, John Scud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Mr. Noah Marſh, requeſting them to be particular in the education of my children, which pledges are the greateſt anxiety and comfort to my inmoſt ſoul. We alſo ſent a petition to General Waſhington, relative to our ſituation and informed him, at leaſt, we were here, and many other poor priſoners alſo.</p>
            <p>Sept. 26. We received a letter from Richard Murray, <abbr>Eſq.</abbr> in anſwer to one we wrote to him laſt March, a copy of which follows:</p>

            <p>The reaſon for not putting the copy of this letter down ſooner is, we have expected an exchange would be made for us, or relief given ſome way; but are now in expectation of continuing another winter in this cold, dreary country, where the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants can ſcarcely get victuals to ſupport nature; or at leaſt, if any family in the ſtates of America

were to live as they do, I judge they would think it hard times indeed; but more of this another time: yet we are obliged to frequently be dependent on the people where we are quartered for ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon neceſſaries of life. It is evident to me that every perſon who takes up arms in the cauſe of his country, has an idea that he may meet with the fate of war, either by being killed, wounded or taken priſoner; but it muſt be a ſevere reflection to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, when he is thus voluntarily armed for the cauſe of his country, that in caſe he ſhould be made a priſoner, he will be thus neglected by that country whoſe rights he was contending for, and occaſioned his impriſonment in cold jails, &amp;c. without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon neceſſaries of life. However, it is a leſſen to learn ſilence, and wait with patience; for whatever God ordains is full of wiſe providences. How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand years has this globe rolled on its axis, floated with a vaſt ocean, high mountains, cities and empires, with millions of the planetary heavens, all moving in order under the guidance of ſo great an Architect, to plant them all in due form, and ſay hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſhalt thou come and no farther: I ſay, when we conſider that we are the creatures of ſo g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

            <p>Wedneſday, October 3. Capt. M'Fall has left us; and ſince he has been exchanged, has been our commandant: and in order to ſhew he was a man of authority, gave us ſtrict orders not to be ſeen to carry any kind of arms, except thoſe of our own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and left the ſame orders with the Captain of the militia; pretending he hand orders from the commander in chief ſo to do; and alſo that we ſhould not be out of our lodgings after eight o'clock at night. We thank him for ſuch a ſignal piece of
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:027681_0141_0FD5DB37621A7BE8"/>
complaiſance; but wool will not grow from a hog's back. Poor Smith informs me that his thoughts at present are on procuring the neceſſaries of life, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but pork and bread to live on; and after many perplexing cogitations how to proceed, his only alternative is to go and dig potatoes. The Captain of the militia has diſpiſed the orders left him by the laſt commander in chief over four of us, and permits us to go fowling. I find plenty of ducks and plover.</p>
            <p>Saturday, 13th. I have had a hard turn of a fever; but find myſelf recovering. Having obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed permiſſion from government, to have the liberty of aſking credit of merchants (which, until within ſix weeks we could not be permitted to do, nor to write a line to any ſubject in Canada, except Mr. Murray, commiſſary of priſoners) we wrote the merchants a preſſing letter, ſetting forth our indigent circumſtances; yet no other attention was paid to it than to ſend us word we could not have any cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. But I do not diſpair, although in a feeble ſtate of health.</p>
            <p>Tueſday, 16th. Capt. Smith and myſelf took a walk to St. John's; and will mention, that during the ſummer paſt, Mr. Smith and myſelf have had ſeveral ſerious, and I truſt agreeable, converſations together on matters of the utmoſt conſequence; we both agree, that for wiſe purpoſes man was permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to fall; for the more knowledge we obtain, the greater the ſenſation, and of conſequence happineſs or miſery is more natural to the ſoul, as we cannot agree to any part of annihilation after death; for if the ſoul is miſerable, why ſhould it be ſo if there is not that remorſe of reflection on the duties and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands it diſobeyed whilſt on earth? Therefore, of conſequence, thoſe who die happy are unſpeakably
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:027681_0142_0FD5DB67788D3028"/>
ſo, on the thought of having travelled through ſo many toils, and ſo weariſome a pilgrimage while em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied in clay. We have often heard it ſuggeſted, that the ſoul after departing from the body, knew nothing of what it had paſſed through in this life: as well might the idea of annihilation be held up; for it was the undoubted deſign of the Great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of our exiſtence to ſend us through theſe thorny roads, to prepare us for an event of the greateſt importance: if we acted aright, happineſs inexpreſſible muſt preſent to view; and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, miſery without end or deſcription; and both on the reflection of a well or ill ſpent life, the ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration on redemption, together with being relieved from a ſinful ſtate and made entirely pure, are thoughts unſpeakable indeed; and alſo, if man had known no ſin, he would have been ignorant of ſo great a ſalvation. Mr. Smith is a deep-thoughted gentleman.</p>
            <p>Friday, October 19. Capt. Smith and Lieut. Dunning this day commenced cutting wood for the Canadians, at thirty coppers a cord, and find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Poor Smith again hangs his under lip.</p>
            <p>Monday, 22d. I went to a wedding in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and was immediately introduced to the bride, and had to dance a minuet with her, which is the vogue of this country; and their chief dances are minuets. No people that I have ever ſeen appear to be more friendly than the Canadians, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar on rejoicing days, weddings, public meetings, &amp;c. but remarkably more ſo to ſtrangers than any people I have ever met with in any part of the ſtates which I have viſited. The marriage ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny I believe to be nearly as the church of England, except, that the Roman Catholics of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try always go to the church to have the ceremony performed.</p>

Friday, 26th. I went with Meſſrs. Smith and Dunning, and helped to cut wood, which made my hands ſore.</p>
            <p>Monday, October. Agreeable to a former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, I wrote to Mr. Murray for permiſſion to go to Quebec for the reſtoration of my health, being in want of clothing, &amp;c. I received orders, and this morning embarked for ſaid place, and arrived in town in the evening. I tarried that night with Robert Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ran, and next morning went to Mr. Murray's, from whence I went to Mr. Prentiſs's, where I took breakfaſt, and then proceeded to the jail hoſpital, and agreed with Mr. Hill, who keeps the houſe, to live with him. I am locked up, not having permiſſion to go out without the company of Mr. Hill; but to make ſome compenſation, I have the company of Mrs. Hill, my landlady, who is from Boſton, and a very agreeable woman; and alſo a Doctor Duff, one of the Surgeons of the hoſpital, who lodges up ſtairs, and appears much of a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. There are ſeveral priſoners in this place, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom is a Mr. Williams, formerly one of the cuſtom-houſe officers; but being ſo far attached to the Americans, as to ſpeak ſomething in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor, has been for ſome time under cloſe confinement. Mr. Davis, whom I have before mentioned, is here; and his exploits and connexions, would ſwell a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume as large as the Devil on Two Sticks, and the whole to as little purpoſe.</p>
            <p>November 3. Serjeant Weed informs me, that he has diſcovered a gentleman in town, the firſt let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of whoſe ſirname is J, who is willing to aſſiſt the priſoners; and being deſtitute of money, I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately wrote him a letter, ſtating the ſituation of my brother officers and myſelf. Mr. Weed ſoon returned, and ſaid the man had not more than half

read my letter before he appeared affected; he ſent a half-joe for our preſent relief, and ſaid that was not the whole we might expect from him. I muſt confeſs, if ever my heart felt gratitude, it was on this occaſion. Laſt evening I knew not how to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a ſingle farthing, being an entire ſtranger; but have at preſent an ample ſupply, with the rations I draw, for ſome time; and expect further aſſiſtance for Capt. Smith and Mr. Dunning. This inſtance of humanity I truſt will not be forgotten by me du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring my ſtay on earth.</p>
            <p>Nov. 8. I have had a viſit from my good old friend James Caſſedy, and have ſome evenings the agreeable company of Capt.

            <p>PEGU, a conſiderable kingdom of Aſia, in the Eaſt Indies, on the ſoutheaſt ſide of the Bay of Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, bounded by the king of Ava on the north, by the mountains which ſeparate it from Laos on the eaſt, by the king of Siam and the Bay of Bengal on the ſouth, and by another part of the Bay of Bengal on the weſt. It has a town of the ſame name, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty miles within land, and above twenty miles in circumference; but at preſent not one-twentieth part is inhabited; for it was ruined by the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Barma, whoſe king is a potent prince. This country, like others between the tropics, is flooded when the ſun is vertical, but the mud and ſlime which the waters leave when they retire, render the low lands fruitful as the Nile does thoſe of Egypt. As to the high grounds, they are ſoon parched up after the rains
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:027681_0145_0FD5DB6F022F5B50"/>
are over; and if they ſow wheat on them, as they ſometimes do, they are forced to water their fields by little channels which convey the water from their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>isterns and reſervoirs; but they ſow much more rice than wheat, which is more ſuitable to the flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſoil. The houſes are frequently built on pillars by the river ſide, and in the time of rains they have no communication with one another, but by boats, in the flat country. The product of this country is like the other parts of the Eaſt-Indies. They have alſo good fiſh, pork and poultry. They wear no European commodities but hats and ribbands. They have cottons, ſilks, and ſilver, from Bengal and the neighboring countries. The government is arbitrary, and the king's will is a law; yet he does not often abuſe his power: he has a large handſome palace at Ava, with four ga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants are but thinly clad, and the beſt among them wear neither ſhoes nor ſtockings. The Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maes go almoſt naked, and make figures in their ſkins, like the ancient Picts, by pricking themſelves with a bodkin, and rubbing them over with cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

They wear petticoats which are open before; and this part of the dreſs was ſaid to be invented by a queen of this country, to draw the men off from unnatural vices. The women are very fond of ſtrangers, and any man may have a wife for the time he ſtays there. The wife goes to market, dreſſes the victuals, takes care of her huſband's clothes, and ſells his goods by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail. If ſhe proves falſe the huſband may ſell her for a ſlave; and if he goes aſtray, ſhe will give him a

doſe of poiſon. There are a vaſt number of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in this country, but moſt of wood, which are varniſhed and gilded. The prieſts have ground al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them, which they cultivate for their ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and are ſaid to be ſtrict obſervers of morality. They are called talapoins, and inculcate charity as the higheſt virtue, affirming that religion to be beſt which teaches men to do the moſt good. They have idols in their temples, in a ſitting poſture, like tailors, and very large ears. They have curious ſorts of muſic; but the pipe and tabor are eſteemed the beſt. They have one inſtrument ſhaped like a galley, with about twenty bells of different ſizes; and when they ſtrike them with a ſtick, they make no bad muſic. When any happen to be ſhipwreck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the coaſt, if they repair to the temples they will be taken care of, and ſupplied with what they want. Their hills are covered with woods, and they have a great deal of good timber; but their bam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boes (a kind of hollow cane which grows to the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of near a foot in diameter) is of the greateſt uſe; this they bend and form while young, making it fit for whatever they deſign it, and particularly to hang their pelanquins upon: theſe are couches upon which they lie when they travel, carried upon men's ſhoulders. They have but few horſes or ſheep, and plow with oxen and buffaloes, and carry burdens on them as well as on camels; nor does any place abound more in elephants, than this, and the adjacent countries. They compute the ſtrength of their armies by the number and ſize of their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Monday, November 12.—The whole of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, except three from Vermont, and commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed officers, are ſent to Saint Paul's Bay, about thirty leagues down the river, to be billeted with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.

I directed a line to Doctor Mebane, the head ſurgeon of the town hoſpital, who came to ſee me; and on repreſenting to him that I conſidered myſelf bound on parole, but was locked up like a priſoner that had no pretenſions to a liberation; that I wiſhed now and then to be indulged to walk out in town with Mr. Hill, or ſome gentleman,—he gave Mr. Hill orders to permit me by turns to walk out with him, as the governor will not permit any continental officer to be in town, without the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of a Britiſh ſubject; it being of a dangerous nature: and as we officers are people of ſuch conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the Britiſh crown might totter to its very centre thereby. This is not the Doctor's excuſe, but mine.</p>
            <p>Monday, 26th. I received by the hands of Mr. Murray, three half-joes, from one of the beſt of men, Col. John Campbell, at Montreal.</p>
            <p>Yeſterday Mr. Hill's child of ten days old was chriſtened, and a number of genteel people aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in the church of England form, on the occaſion; we had plenty of good cheer, and as I recover my health faſt, partook with chearfulneſs; and much ſociable converſation took place. The parſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be an agreeable man, and talked with ſenſe, and apparent ſorrow for the unhappy diſpute between England and America, and gave me the news of young Butler's being killed, with a number of his party.</p>
            <p>Tueſday, 27th. I went with Mr. Hill to the provoſt, on a viſit to ſee the priſoners, and was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced to Col.

Banters, from Ballſtown, who were taken laſt ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. I dined with the Colonel, Mr. Charles Hay, and Francis Cazeau; we paſſed the afternoon agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, and in the evening Mr. Hill came and waited on me to my old quarters, and of conſequence I am now a man of importance.</p>
            <p>INDIA, a vaſt country of Aſia, which received its name from the river indus, ſituated partly in the temperate and partly under the torrid zone, and conſequently the air is very different. Towards the north it is pretty temperate; but towards the ſouth, on the contrary, it is very hot, and it rains almoſt conſtantly for three months in the year, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders the heat more ſupportable, and contributes to fertilize the ground, which produces abundance of rice, millet, cotton, ſigs, pomegranates, Oran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, citron, cocoa-nuts, and many other fruits, of which there are none in Europe, but what have been tranſported from thence. There are mines of gold and ſilver, and ſeveral ſorts of precious ſtones, borax and ſalt petre. They fiſh in the ſea and riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers for pearls. This country produces ſeveral ſorts of animals, as well domeſtic as wild; ſuch as ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, rhinoceroſes, camels, dromedaries, buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faloes, lions, tygers, leopards, panthers, and a vaſt number of monkeys. The trade is exceeding great, and it chiefly conſiſts of Indigo, ſalt petre, cotton, and precious ſtones; but more eſpecially in a prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous quantity of calicoes, chintzes, and other ſtuffs of various kinds. The Europeans had little or no intercourſe with the Indies, until the year 1498, when the Portugueſe diſcovered a way by ſea, round the Cape of Good Hope, and then ſoon began to make ſettlements therein, and ſoon became very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, till the Dutch drove them away from many
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:027681_0149_0FD5DB76D3EC3070"/>
of their factories. The Indians are generally gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toos or idolaters, though there are a great many mahometans; in the places that depend upon the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans, ſome of them have become Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics. Many of the idolaters believe in the tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gration of ſouls, and will not kill or eat any thing that has life; not the moſt trifling inſect or animal. The principal prieſts are Brachmans, and there are faquiers who make their principal devotion to conſiſt in the choice of the moſt troubleſome poſtures, which they never leave till they take their laſt exit. Some paſs ſeveral years without laying down night or day, reſting only upon a cord which is ſtretched out; others ſhut themſelves up in a cave ſeveral days without eating or drinking; ſome hold their arms lifted up ſo long that they can never ſtir them afterwards; in ſhort others put burning coals on their heads, and let them be there till the fire reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the very bones. Sometimes thoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aquiers go in a body together, followed by a great number of diſciples, and they often make a merit of killing Chriſtians. It was a cuſtom among the gentoos, for the women to burn themſelves with their deceaſed huſbands; but it is not ſo frequent as it formerly was, becauſe the mahometans will not allow of it.</p>
            <p>The people of Proper India, as well as thoſe of China, who ought to know better, proſtrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the ground with great devotion, that the ſun and moon when eclipſed may not be devoured by a certain dragon to which they imagine the defect of light is owing. The Pagans worſhip idols of vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſhapes: ſome appear very monſtrous, part hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and part beaſt or fiſh, and ſcarce any living ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal but what they adore, particularly the ox and the monkey.

Meſſrs. Lauckaling, Smith and M'Coy, paid me a viſit, and we had an agreeable converſation.

I have been for ſome days paſt employed by Doctor Hunt, an old ſergeant, in drawing off accounts relative to the hoſpital department, as to liquors and other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries for that purpoſe; and likewiſe ſome in the medicine way, which, according to law, muſt be in Engliſh; and good Engliſh I made of it, with a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble entry, beyond a doubt; and it is a ſpecimen of Hunt's and my abilities: at any rate the Britiſh crown ſtands well charged.</p>
            <p>December 18. This day I had my friend James Caſſedy to dine with me.</p>

After ſervice we returned home and dined with ſeveral perſons of Mr. Hill's acquaintance. Some particulars of the Roman Catholics, relative to Chriſtmas evening and day, will not be amiſs. The young women about ſunſet aſſemble at the houſe of the parſon of the pariſh, and are divided into ſmall diviſions of three or four, according to their number; and the candles and lamps of the church being previouſly lighted, the whole go into the church and pay their devotion; after which, all but the firſt company retire to the parſon's, and the young women who are left, continue in devotion for one or two hours, and are relieved alternately thro' the night, in commemoration of our Saviour's being

this evening born; but no male or married woman, nor any female whoſe chaſtity is ſuſpected, is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that evening into church. The day is kept as holy time, and the whole of the inhabitants attend divine ſervice, by way of returning thanks. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect of either reading or hearing of an author who, ſpeaking on the different methods of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God, mentions ſomething to this purport—that the Proteſtants endeavor to worſhip God as ſtrictly as poſſible by a few ceremonies, and the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholics by many ceremonies: and I cannot but hope, and indeed do not doubt, but either deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination who are ſincere in their devotions to the Great Author of all exiſtence, will find mercy through the atonement of a dying <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Amen.—After ſervice, I went with Mr. Hill, and dined with Meſſrs.

We had alſo ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent apples that grew on Mr. Cazeau's place at Montreal. The day was ſpent agreeably. I have often wondered why Mr. Cazeau in particular ſhould be confined, for he appears to be one of the moſt friendly, inoffenſive men I ever met with, and ſeems to have too much goodneſs in him to be guilty of harming the Britiſh or Americans. I am, through the goodneſs of Providence, perfectly reſtored to health.</p>

               </gap>rigid, cold, and poor country; therefore have called on my employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Doctor Serjeant Hunt, who is only a purveyor, or aſſiſtant, in the hoſpital, and underſtands medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine ſomething better than I do, but no great, and is nothing at all on my part. He has put up for my ſervices in poſting books, three pounds of green tea, ſugar, port wine, &amp;c. I expreſſed to Mr. and Mrs. Hill, my ſorrow at being obliged to go away, and they appeared no leſs to regret my departure, as no people ever could have uſed a priſoner more friendly than I was treated by them, and alſo by Doctor Duff. I mentioned to Duff, that if I had his abilities, or underſtood any thing relative to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, I could get a good living on the Iſle of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans. He immediately replied that he would make a Doctor of me in a few hours, and ordered ſeveral kinds of medicine put up, and wrote particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections on each medicine, and for what uſe; he have me two crown lancets to bleed with, and Buchan's Family Phyſician, as a guide in my practice. The medicine, phials, &amp;c. being arranged in good order in my cheſt, I felt important, and portended relief, although I had never thought of being beneficial to mankind in this way before, and in the agitation of my mind, never ſhall. We had not more than fixed the medicines and my other affairs, before in came a Canadian for me, whom Doctor Duff addreſſed in the following manner: "Sir, the gentleman who is going with you to the Iſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

which I was accoſted with a <hi>bon jure;</hi> or how do you do Doctor. I then took my leave of Mr. Hill, Mrs. Hill, Doctor Duff, with the family and poor priſoners, and went down to the provoſt, took din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with Meſſrs. Hay, Cazeau and Gordon; and about two o'clock, bade them and the reſt of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners in that provoſt farewell. The other officers might have gone to the Iſle of Orleans, but choſe to ſtay until ſpring. The two Banters went in one carriol, and a Mr. Patterſon of the Britiſh line, and myſelf in another. Mr. Patterſon is going down to be our commandant. We had good horſes and made headway faſt over the ice, and ſtruck the Iſle of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans with reſolution as officers and phyſicians of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; and inſtead of going by St. Lawrence, or Cileroy, we went by the pariſh of St. Peter (or St. Pierre) where I had again to reſume my jabbering of French, and a bungling hand I make of it; and amof opinion, if the King of France knew how I tare his language to pieces, he would tare my hair. We are at the Captain of the Militia's houſe; the old man is ſomething deaf, and has been ſo for about twenty years. He is above ſixty years old, but it matters not with me: I inform him that his hearing can be reſtored, which makes him chearful, and he promiſes to become one of my patients. However, I took a little bay ſalt, which I diſſolved and put in his ears; I ſtuffed them full of wool before he went to bed, and made him as deaf as an adder that night. The next morning, on taking out the wool, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelf much better, although I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it. After breakfaſt we took our leave; he aſked my demands, which I ſaid was nothing. Our commander in chief, as yet, is not led into the ſecret of my phyſical ideas, and does not know but I am the practitioner I pretend to be. It being a very ſtormy,
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:027681_0155_0FD5DB90EC4A0EF8"/>
cold morning, with difficulty we arrived at St. Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which place is as near from where we came to the iſland, as St. Peter's; but the drivers had their views: and we have concluded, on account of being a ſtormy day, to ſtay all night; and Mr. Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſon's being a very civil obliging man, makes the time more agreeable, but I can find the Canadians look at me with great attention, as my doctorſhip ſpreads faſt through the land. Snow or no ſnow, ſome think me a great man by one obſervation, and ſome by another: indeed I can neither walk nor ſpeak but notice is taken whether I am the Surgeon, as is pretended. The French in Canada call all Doctors Surgeons. Many complaints have this day appeared before me; but I led them into a ſecret, that my medicines are all locked up; that they are of a good quality, new and freſh from England, and ſome from France; and if they want to employ me, I will wait on them at any time; but no advice can be given gratis, without it is to poor people who have no money nor eſtate, which they think is <hi>bone,</hi> or right.</p>

The Captain's wife preſented to me a ſmall dwarf of a child that had been ſix months unwel, and was covered with ſores. I informed her, that if ſhe could prevail on her huſband to ſend to my lodgings at St. Francis, I would ſend relief, and reſtore her to good health; but they all appear to be afraid of their caſh. One thing I know they ought to be more fearful of,—that my doctoring will do them no good. We all of choice ſat out on foot, and left our baggage to be brought on the

I had to ſalute the French ladies of my acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and had no objection, as it is a faſhion in this country, and think it no harm in any, when friends meet after a long abſence. We that night had a dance; and Mr. Patterſon not being able to ſpeak French, nor the Banters, my doctorſhip was not diſcovered.

Smith and Mr. Dunning of the affair, who aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted me in making fair weather in the doctoring way. The houſe I am now living in, is the ſame that Capt.

JAPAN, a large country in the moſt eaſtern part of Aſia, with the title of an Empire, is between 130 and 144 degrees of eaſt longitude, and between 30 and 40 degrees of north latitude. It is compoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of ſeveral iſlands, the principal of which, are Niphon and Sacock—Niphon or Japan iſland, is about ſix hundred miles long, and from one hundred to one hundred and fifty broad; the chief town is Jeddo. The next largeſt iſland is Sacock, parted by a very narrow channel from Niphon, lying ſouth of it, and is about five hundred miles round; the capital city is Bango. The third iſland in magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is Tonſa, divided from Niphon and Sacock by a very narrow channel, and is near four hundred miles in circumference; the capital city is Tonſa—beſides theſe, are a great many leſſer about them, ſubject to Japan. It was diſcovered by the Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe, in the year fifteen hundred and forty-two, being caſt on ſhore by a tempeſt. The whole em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire is divided into ſeven countries, which are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided into ſeventy provinces. It is the richeſt country in the world for ſilver and gold. The air and water are very good. Cedars are common, and ſo large that they are proper for the maſts of ſnips, and columns for temples. Their pearls are in great eſteem. Japan is counted one of the beſt countries in Aſia; the inhabitants are naturally ingenious, and have a happy memory; but their manners are diametrically oppoſite to thoſe of the Europeans. Our common drinks are cold, and their's are all hot; we uncover the head out of reſpect, and they the feet; we are fond of white teeth, and they of black: we get on horſeback on the left ſide, and they on the right; and they have a language ſo peculiar that it is underſtood by no other nation. They value their lives ſo little, that when a lord makes a feaſt

Their emperor is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Dairo, and reſides at Meaco, and has no land, but has a right of ſelling titles and dignities, and the idolatrous prieſts make contributions. He wears a black habit, and a cap on his head; his feet muſt never touch the ground, nor muſt he ever be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the rays of the ſun. He never cuts his hair nor beard, nor his nails, and all his victuals muſt be dreſſed in new veſſels. When he goes abroad, he is carried by fourteen men in a litter, and ſurrounded with curtains, ſo that he may ſee and not be ſeen. He has twelve wives, who have each a palace, with ſinging and dancing women for his diverſion; he has alſo an unlimited number of concubines. His palace is adorned with three hundred and ſixty-five idols. The religion of the whole country is pagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm; but there are two different ſects, and yet there is no part of the world where there are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts than here; but the women are not chaſte. The Dairo has ſixty or ſeventy vaſſal princes or kings, as they are called, under his dominion, and can depoſe or puniſh them as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

preferred to ſome poſt. The Dairo is attended by five or ſix thouſand of his guards when he goes out, and keeps up an army of 20,000 horſe, and 100,000 foot, though to what purpoſe is not eaſy to conceive, having no enemies to contend with, unleſs he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects his vaſſals may prove malcontents. His reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues are greater than thoſe of any monarch upon earth. The Portugueſe firſt trafficked with this country; but theſe and all other Chriſtians have been baniſhed Japan theſe laſt hundred years, on a pretence of a conſpiracy the Portugueſe and their Japan proſelytes had formed againſt the ſtate; the Dutch only were admitted this priviledge to trade thither; and it is ſaid they declared themſelves not to be Chriſtians, and trampled on the croſs to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Japaneſe in this opinion; but the Japaneſe are ſo ſuſpicious even of the Dutch, that when any of their ſhips arrive, they take away their ſails, heim and guns, and carry them on ſhore until they are ready to ſail, and the Dutch factors are ſhut up on a little peninſula, during the eight months their ſhipping is abſent annually, and are not ſuffered to have ſo much as a lighted candle in their houſes in the night time. The goods the Dutch, carry to Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan, are ſpices, ſugars, ſilks, woollen and linen cloth, elephants' teeth, and haberdaſhery wares, and receive in return, gold, ſilver, fine copper, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binets, and other japan and lacquered wares.—(This laſt account I have taken from an older date than Brooks' Geography.)

The miniſter of the pariſh attended him, and notwithſtanding many Proteſtants make their ſcoff and ridicule of the Roman Catholic religion, I would not wiſh to be led into ſuch folly; for in my opinion, no man ever appeared more ſincere than the parſon, who expreſſed himſelf as follows—"Periſh, place your truſt in God, for he alone is able to ſave you; we can do our duty, but the Almighty the whole." It is generally conſtrued, that the Roman prieſts give the laſt benediction to dying perſons, and forgive their ſins, which Mr. Duran diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, any farther than it is an ordinance and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to lay the hands on the ſick, pray over them, and give the laſt ſacrament, according to the order of Saint James; but as to be inſtruments of forgiving ſins, he utterly denies it; or why ſhould ſouls go to purgatory, everlaſting miſery, &amp;c.

               </gap>ellow mortals, in particular as to the great article of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and adoration to the Supreme God, although they even vary from my opinion in points of their manner of devotion, it demands my moſt ſtrict enquiry, whether they are not as ſincere in their performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as myſelf and thoſe who are brought up under the ſame profeſſion with me. Education has a
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:027681_0162_0FD5DB2315A65BC0"/>
ſtrong propenſity to form the mind, and from daily experience, it is not eaſy to purſuade a perſon from that which was cultivated in him from infancy. A chain of reflections on this may ariſe: but this I hold—that there is a juſt and merciful God, who is the former of worlds unknown, and every part thereof, and that whoever bows the knee to ſo great a Sovereign, with a heart full of humility, and hath a reverential eye towards him as their Parent of nature, humbly requeſting a forgiveneſs of their ſins, mercy awaits them in their final exit from this world, whatever their form of religion may be. Official characters, whoſe religion is their own, may deſpiſe thoſe ſentiments, and call them deiſtical; but in ſuch breaſts, philanthropy towards our fellow mortals muſt be wanting; for our Saviour ſays—"when I am lifted up, I will draw all men unto me:" yet I ſuppoſe a doubt cannot exiſt in a human heart, that it was the meaning of our Saviour, to draw all men unto him that did not pay a reverential homage to the Supreme Lord, and to caſt their dependence on him only, and not on their particular manner of worſhip; or rather the form of ceremonies. Still as I before obſerved, perſons are apt to be tenacious as to the mode in which they are educated, and have reaſon to ſuppoſe, often lay ſo great a ſtreſs on them as to fall into error, by placing too much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on their outward performances; and what ſtill adds to the preſumption, thoſe who are know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the contrary, will teach them ſuch for the ſake of gain; and would only wiſh to be underſtood, that every contrite heart will meet with a good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; therefore, it is neceſſary to look to ourſelves, as well as of different perſuaſions, leſt we diſcover the mote in their eye, and not the beam in our own.</p>

February 10. Great feaſting commences again.</p>
            <p>Monday, 11. The inhabitants aſſemble and feaſt with ſociability.</p>
            <p>Tueſday. Mr. Patterſon and myſelf took a walk to the other ſide of the pariſh this morning, where we found the people, to appearance, like ſtupid ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; for they have eat and drank, danced, ſung and capered, until they now appear almoſt like ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid manuments; but as it is the laſt day of their feaſting, and then faſting for forty days commences, in the cogitation of my brain, in one hour, two mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes and five ſeconds, they will begin to ſriſk., The fact is, in this country, generally ſpeaking, the inhabitants live vaſtly poor, to what they do in the ſtates of America: for their breakfaſt is conſtantly a piece of bread, and if an onion can be had it is an excellent repaſt. Their dinner is at twelve o'clock, which is made by boiling a ſmall piece of pork or beef, but moſtly pork; and in the winter, the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants have peas, with vegetables, which are boiled<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the meat, and have alſo ſhred cabbage, onions, &amp;c. and to finiſh, a bowl of bread cut thin, which taſtes palatable, and is for dinner and ſupper; but in ſummer, meat is commonly ſcant. I have known hard labouring families to breakfaſt on bread, dine and ſup on any kind of vegetables that can be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, ſuch as long ſorrel, and other wild herbs, before their gardens come on: theſe herbs are boiled and bread is ſhred into them, with ſome milk, and not a morſel of meat; but I am informed the whole province do not live in ſo poor a manner; but they never make a diſh of coffee or chocolate, and as to tea, they are entirely ignorant of it. I am told it was formerly the cuſtom for the inhabitants to have a little cheap wine, which is called black ſtrap, or the dregs of port, to drink a glaſs of in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:027681_0164_0FD5DBABF38EBEE8"/>

I have attempted to inform them, in my way of jabbering French, the way in which the Boſtonians live (for ſuch all the American people are called by the Canadians.) In the firſt place, we have our tea, coffee, or chocolate, in the morning, and a piece of beef, cheeſe or ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cake; and for dinner, we have meat plenty, and very little ſoup, with turnips, potatoes, cabbage, and garden roots, &amp;c. In the afternoon, tea again; and for ſupper, either meat, bread and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, or a diſh of muſh and milk; and in winter a mug of cyder, and that we thought nothing of giving away a mug or two in the evening's chat, to a neighbour, &amp;c. and to be ſure I told as good a ſtory of my native place as it deſerved, and of the American States in general, which drew great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. I alſo informed them, that the ladies of our country wore high-heeled ſhoes, and the richeſt cloth, and that every day; which information they could ſtand no longer, and exclaimed, "La Boſtona montier cum la diabol:"—that is, the Boſtonian lies like the devil: for the women of this country all wears mockiſons every day, as well as the men.</p>
            <p>They have potatoes in this country, but do not raiſe ſo plenty as in the ſtates, and I have ſeen very few turnips or garden roots, except onions, which are generally raiſed, and are large; but the idea of garlics being much uſed in this province, I believe is ill-founded, as I have never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

It is aſtoniſhing how they will gluttoniſe, from the aged to the children, in theſe times. It is common to riſe on the firſt day, about twelve or one o'clock at night, and no bounds are ſet, in particular as to eating. They now appear like ſnakes juſt come out of the froſt. However, the forty days without any, meat will make an alteration in their appetites; but I have ſome expectation yet to be called on as phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, to adminiſter relief.</p>
            <p>INDOSTAN, Proper India, or the Empire of the Great Mogul, is bounded on the weſt by Perſia, on the ſouth by the weſtern Peninſula, on the eaſt by the eaſtern Peninſula, and on the north by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral kingdoms of Independent Tartary. It is a vaſt country, and is at leaſt two thouſand five hundred miles in length, and is very fertile in all kinds of corn, and all the commodities of the Eaſt Indies are to be met with here. The inhabitants are more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane with regard to ſtrangers, and not ſo great enemies to Chriſtians as the Turks, although they dreſs in the ſame manner, and take ſeveral wives, being much addicted to luxury. The Great Mogul, was the richeſt prince in the world, eſpecially in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amonds and precious ſtones, till Ko<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He often takes away lands that any one has cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and gives worſe in their room. His revenue is ſaid to amount to near fifty millions a year, ſterling, and has an army of two hundred thouſand ſoot,

            <p>PETERSBURGH, a large handſome city, the capital of Ruſſia, built by Peter the Great, Czar of Muſcova, in the year 1703. It is of prodigeous extent, and contained not long ago, ſixty thouſand houſes. It is ſeated on an iſland, which lies in the middle of the river Neiva, where the land is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably raiſed. The worſt of this place is, that the land is not high enough to eſcape inundations, which at times has occaſioned the loſs of vaſt ſums of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, by reaſon of the fortifications being waſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way before they were well finiſhed. The breadth of the river at Peterſburgh, is about half a mile; and as it is very deep and rapid, the building of a bridge over it was held impracticable, whereupon it was propoſed to the Czar, Peter the Great, to make a bridge of pontoons or boats; but he would not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to it, he ſaid, becauſe his intention was to
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:027681_0167_0FD5DBAEE93193F8"/>
breed up as many watermen as he could, and theſe he prohibited the uſe of oars, that they might learn to manage ſails; but theſe boatmen being ignorant peaſants, many people were drowned in paſſing from one part of the town to the other, at firſt. The nobility and people of diſtinction were obliged to build grand houſes here, but the generality were timber houſes, till they began to burn brick, and the town now appears with a much better face than it did at firſt. The trade was ſmall and proviſions ſcarce, becauſe the lakes Ladoga and Onega, had not depth enough to carry large veſſels, but Peter the Great, remedied this inconvenience, in 1720, by cutting a canal from lake Ladoga, of about ſeventy-five miles in length, ſeventy feet in breadth, and ten in depth; ten years were employed in this work. It is a vaſt place of trade, and flouriſhing. All kinds of religion are tolerated, and foreigners have the ſame privileges with the natives. A new road is made between Peterſburgh and Moſcow, in a ſtraight line acroſs the foreſts, planted with trees on each ſide; five hundred and fifty miles in length, and at every eight miles is a large poſt, ſat up to direct travellers, and at every ſtation are twenty horſes kept ſaddled and bridled for an immediate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. The inhabitants are reckoned at one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand, from all countries, there being not many original natives. It may ſeem ſtrange that Peter the Great, ſhould fix upon this place to build his capital city, it lying in a barren country, and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ar to the north, that they ſcarce enjoy the light of the ſun in the winter; but it was in order to have a communication with the Baltic ſea, and that his ſubjects might traffic with the reſt of the nations of Europe, for as yet there was no ſea that touched upon the territory of Ruſſia, but that of Archangel, to
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:027681_0168_0FD5DBB0C9C5DC90"/>
which ſhipping was obliged to paſs through the fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen ocean. It was notwithſtanding the proſpect of trade, with great difficulty that the Czar compaſſed this grand deſign, his ſubjects ſhewing the utmoſt averſon to removing to this cold, barren country, as he commanded them, from all parts of his dominions, and ſuch rubs were laid in his way by his nobility and officers, that it was thought impoſſible he ſhould effect his deſign. There was neither ſufficient tools or proviſions provided for the workmen, who ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all manner of hardſhips, inſomuch that it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted no leſs than one hundred thouſand people pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in laying the foundation, and building this metropolis. However, all difficulties were at length overcome, and the ſixty thouſand houſes were all built in leſs than four years, and is now one of the largeſt and moſt populous cities in the world. The Czar eſtabliſhed here an academy marine, to which he obliged every conſiderable family in his empire to ſend one of their ſons or relations to be inſtructed in navigation; here alſo they learnt the dead langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, were taught to ride and fence, and other exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes. He ſet up woolen and linen manufactories, had paper-mills, powder-mills, laboratories for gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery and fire-works, places for preparing ſaltpetre and brimſtone; he erected yards for making cables and tackling for his navy, and a foundery, where they are perpetually caſting great guns, mortars, and ſmall arms; the country furniſhing him with vaſt quantities of iron-ore. A printing-houſe was alſo ſet up to encourage his ſubjects to enquire into the ſtate of the world; and he ſent many of them to foreign countries, to learn mechanic arts, giving great encouragement to foreigners to come to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſburg, and inſtruct his people in every ſcience; plays, operas, and muſic-meetings were alſo intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,

in a country where none of theſe arts of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions were ſeen till the reign of Peter the Great. It is ſeventy-nine years from the time I am now writing this Journal, ſince Peter the Great firſt laid the foundation of Peterſburg, after he had travelled through a great part of Europe, viſited the dock yards of Amſterdam &amp; London, in both of which he worked with his own hands.

            <p>Thurſday, 28th<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It being a ſnowy day, which my eyes are often ſaluted with; I take another turn of mentioning what ſuperſtition and groſs ignorance, many Canadians are led into. The following in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is given to me as a fact, by old people, and as many more as I have hairs in my eyebrows: In the pariſh on the other ſide of the river, which is named St. Ann, is the ſtatue of St. Ann in the church, which they hold performs many miracles, ſuch as reſtoring ſight to the blind, healing the ſick; and lame perſons who go into the church on crutches are reſtored to health, and leave their crutches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind as a ſtanding monument of their being healed, which are any day to be ſeen in the chapel. I was urged to take a tour thither, and was aſſured I would find the crutches hanging up according to their word; but I never went, having no faith. However, as they ſay, about ſix years ago, a man had a little ſon murdered; the ſiſter of the huſband, who was privy to the murder of the child, told her brother, or the bereaved, that his wife was the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who was guilty of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>act; upon which he took his wife ſo accuſed, into the woods, in order to murder her: but ſhe begged her life, and ſaid if he
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:027681_0170_0FD5DB03EB9D40B0"/>
would break both her arms, ſhe would never return until they were reſtored, which would be in three days, by praying to St. Ann; and if not, ſhe would ſtarve in ſaid place, which would declare her guilt or innocence; and finally was perſuaded to break both her arms. She requeſted a book might be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced before her, fixed on a ſtick, ſo that by blowing the leaves, ſhe could turn them. As he was going from her, a thorn ran into his foot, which ſhe pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed might never be extracted but by her hands. The huſband went home, but no relief could be found; and he was obliged to return to his wife although in the greateſt pain. On his return he found her in the ſame place, perfectly reſtored to health; her arms were well, and ſhe immediately pulled the thorn from his foot. They both recovered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home with joy. They ſay the woman is now living in ſaid pariſh. She was conſtant in prayer to St. Ann, who not only reſtored her arms and health, but told her who was the murderer of the child, and the young woman was hung, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>My doctoring has not added, as yet, much to my wealth. I have been called frequently to adminiſter medicines; but make a bad hand of it, in particular as to bleeding. I was ſent for by Mrs. Bunet (where Capt. Smith lives) to bleed her, and it being the firſt time I had ever attempted any thing of the kind, was much at a loſs how to proceed; but receiving ſome directions from Smith, &amp;c. I went to the houſe, where my patient was ſitting by a ſtove, with her feet up to her knees in warm water. I aſked her if ſhe would be bled in the foot; ſhe ſaid no, <hi>la braun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> or arm; on which, for the firſt time, I tied a garter, with judgment, as far as I knew at any rate. A large vein ſoon appeared, and I gave it the lancet, which made the blood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly merrily. The woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:027681_0171_0FD5DB0269FEB798"/>
very warm, bled freely and ſoon began to grow faint; on which I untied the arm, but to no purpoſe; the blood ran, ſhe fainted and cried out <hi>pinche! pinche!</hi> that was to pinch the orifice. I immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obeyed orders, and held her arm from bleeding until ſhe was lain on the bed; but the inſtant I took my fingers away, the blood would fly. At laſt Smith diſcovered an old powder horn, in which was common powder for hunting; he maſhed ſome of the powder and put it on the place, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſtopped the bleeding; and ever after that I carried maſhed gunpowder with me to ſtop the blood, and was eſteemed ſtill a ſurgeon.</p>
            <p>An old man on the other ſide of the pariſh who was unwel, ſent for me. I gave him a portion of Glaubers ſalts; but it had no effect: I gave rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb, and the ſame I gave jallap, which the old man ſaid ſtopped his mouth, for he had no ſtomach to eat; but by giving a clyſter, gave vent to the whole. He lived a few days; but being old and low in health, and having for a long time been irregular in his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, he left the world, and I hope in peace; at leaſt I do not judge that what I gave him haſtened him out any ſooner; if it did, I was not to blame; for phyſic he would have. I have been examined by the parſon of the pariſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to know if my abilities in phyſic are equal to my pretenſions. I obſerved that I was not able to talk with him in French, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin I was ſenſible he knew, but ſuppoſed his ſtudy had been on divinity, and not on phyſic; but if he ſcrupled me, to ſend for any doctor and I would be willing to undergo an examination, but it muſt be a man who could ſpeak Engliſh, and I did not care how much Latin. He ſaid it was well, and aſked no further queſtions.</p>
            <p>The Canadians are drowned in ignorance and

bigotry, full of errors, as I think; but I am ſure are entailed to prieſtcraft, and apt to believe in ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious reports, which for my preſent amuſement I am going to relate; and which I have from a man of as good credit as any in this place, <abbr>viz.</abbr>—That on the 2d day of November, the whole of the Roman Catholics throughout the world go to maſs, and pray that the dead may be diſcharged from limbo or purgatory, and that all from thence may receive ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution from Good. The ſame evening the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants all keep within doors, for fear of ſeeing ſouls going from the lower to the upper world; and mentioned ſeveral who had been ſo preſumptuous as to be out on that night, who had ſeen ghoſts, and ſome were converted even into brutes, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo for ſeveral days. If any one has committed a flagrant crime, and does penance for a long time in limbo, the dead ſo detained appears to ſome ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving friend; and if they have ſtolen or taken any thing unjuſtly, they deſire them to diſcharge the debt, or make reſtitution, and entreat the church in their behalf. The man by whom this ſtory is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

She gave fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther directions that he muſt pay for ten maſſes, which he and his wife, and ſeveral of the neighbors, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare he paid the prieſt here and at Quebec; and this was diſcovered by the apparition in his barn, at open day. It is ſurpriſing the Canadians ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to actually believe in ſuch things, and for the gain of the prieſts (in being paid for maſſes) encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ſuch folly. No people under the ſun, in my
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:027681_0173_0FD5DBB70820EEC0"/>
opinion, ſtand leſs to their word, than the Canadians; and they are not the moſt honeſt. Mrs. Lebbe, with whom Dunning lives, tells us, that whilſt ſhe was pregnant with her youngeſt child, ſhe was very feeble, and promiſed St. Ann (who, if I underſtand, was midwife at the birth of our Saviour; but they ſeem to be at a loſs in that matter, although they believe her to be ſuch) that if ſhe would deliver her of a living child, ſhe would make a preſent of it to the ſaint; and the child being alive, is this day to be carried and offered. She was chriſtened Mary St. Ann: indeed there is no girl but what the firſt part of the chriſtian name is Mary, and generally ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that bears a ſcriptural ſound follows, though they are not generally called by the firſt part of their names: ſuch as Mary Angelec, are called An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelic, &amp;c. They ſay, if a perſon is excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from the church, they turn into a mad animal; generally into dogs, which will bite all that come in their way. Mrs. Bunet, my patient, ſays that her brother was one day walking with a pitch-fork in his hand, when he was purſued by one of thoſe dogs. He endeavored to keep the creature off, but to no purpoſe, until he ſtabbed him ſo far with the fork, that the blood ran, when he immediately turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the ſame perſon as before he was excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, and is now living, and that ſhe is well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the perſon.</p>
            <p>There is a difference between an hiſtorian and a journaliſt; as the firſt is bound in honor to ſtate facts, and the latter, to ſet down what comes under his notice; and on this occaſion I would only further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that the accounts I give of the French Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, are related to me by them with a degree of enthuſiaſm; and to doubt in their preſence any of theſe ſtories, will create warmth.</p>

Some old men adviſed me not to ſow my turnips until after the proceſſion at St. Pierre, which was on the 10th of June; for then they expected the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects would diſappear: accordingly, to pleaſe them, I waited until the 17th and ſowed with the neighbors; but they all ſhared the common lot: the graſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers took the whole. The prieſts do not admit a perſon to be buried in their church-yard, if they find out that the ſaid perſon had not confeſſed all his ſins. The people will often go from one pariſh to another to confeſs; and if any one has been guilty of ſome groſs ſin, and dies unconfeſſed of it, he or ſhe is bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on their place: and I am informed unbaptized infants are ſerved in the ſame manner. I often at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their maſs, and never knew it fail, that ſome of them, having before confe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ed their ſins, receive the benediction; or, in our words, a pardon for their ſins. The ceremony of the maſs is performed with a ſeeming ſolemnity. The prieſt ſtands before the altar, in the middle of which is a ſmall looking-glaſs; he puts his hand into a ſmall locker behind the glaſs, and takes out a cup, which I ſuppoſe is ſilver, and waſhes it; after the cup is waſhed, he is for ſome time ſhuffling and ſpeaking low: the clerks keep the whole time ſinging; and after a conſiderable bowing and continued ſpeaking for a long time, the boys who wait on him bring a little white cup; he takes it, and pours ſomething into a glaſs, and after ſome low, and to appearance inarticulate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

After all partake, they return to
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:027681_0175_0FD5DADF3750FAF0"/>
their ſeats, and the whole congregation which, to appearance, at the whole of the maſs before the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament was adminiſtered, were in the profoundeſt devotion, now ſing a hallelujah, with tranſports o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> joy! The prieſt has two young men and ſeveral boys, all clad in white ſurplices, to attend on him during the maſs; their buſineſs is to convey the books from one ſide of the altar to the other, in burning incenſe, &amp;c. &amp;c. At certain times in their ejaculations, a ſmall bell is rang, which to appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance awakens them to a more ardent devotion. They one and all (and I have talked with the moſt ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of them) believe that our Saviour comes in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon behind the glaſs which is on the altar, and there ſanctifies the ſacramental wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er; and that at the time the prieſt is uttering his devotion in a low tone, he is that inſtant talking with Chriſt, face to face, and hold that he is omnipreſent, and can at one time be at a million, or a million of millions of maſſes, and ſanctify the wafer; and are ſo full in the faith, that they fully believe, ſhould they die the inſtant the wafer is put on their tongue, they would immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately aſcend to Paradiſe. It appears to be hard to judge, leſt I be judged; but one thing is certain—if they are erroneous in their doctrine, the common people are ignorant. However, this much can be ſaid of the Roman Catholics, that in all their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhiping, they believe, and endeavor in one part and the other of it, to commemorate the paſſions of our dying Lord. They never eat a piece of bread nor any kind of food, before they lay their hands on their breaſt, make the ſign of a croſs, and aſk a bleſſing on the proviſion they are going to partake of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> They never lie down at night, nor riſe in the morning, without going to prayer. I have often heard it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked by the Proteſtants, that the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:027681_0176_0FD5DAFD40AB4B90"/>
depended on their ceremonies to ſave them, and indeed ſome miniſters will preach ſuch doctrine. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my opinion of the nature of things, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ought always to be the clue on which ſound judgment ſhould reſt; for through all the different ſcenes of life, where on mature conſideration, any thing appears unreaſonable, it puts the mind in ſuſpence: for inſtance, one will preach up this kind, and the other that kind of doctrine, to attain ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; but certainly no one, can condemn the great article of prayer. This we hold, that it is reaſonable, rational, and right, to bow the knee, but more particularly the heart, to the Supreme God; therefore, ſo far as touches prayer the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholics, cannot be condemned; and as to Chriſt's appearing in perſon, it muſt entirely be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to ignorance, &amp; the craft of prieſts. Solomon I think, ſomewhere tells us, that every generation grows wiſer, and I am of opinion that bigotry in a few years will decreaſe faſt, in particular through the United States, and that the people's eyes will be more awakened, than to believe that there is no get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to heaven only by a certain perſuaſion; in fact, the different denominations have crept in through prieſt-craft, and to ſay ſuch a mode is right, and no other, deſerves the ridicule and ſcorn of an enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened people: ſtill, as far as has come to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the different perſuaſions, I condemn none; and for conſcience ſake, let all agree with Paul, that every man may be perſuaded in his own mind, and not condemn another. This I alſo believe, that it is more juſtifiable to pray and worſhip God, than to live as thouſands and tens of thouſands of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants do, who ſeemingly go through the world with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt affinity to devotion, and live and die like the wild aſſes colt.

            <p>March 16, 1782. We are making preparations to make ſugar. I aſſure you, Scudder, your hands would not labor in theſe cold &amp; inhoſpitable climes, in particular through the ſnow and ſuch weather, to get a little ſugar, if it could be helped or neceſſity did not enforce it. My doctoring thrives ſlowly:—but let me ſee what of the clock. I ſuppoſe it to be thirty three minutes after three. I muſt again at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend at a certain houſe in the pariſh, where a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man has for a long time been very ill, and I have frequently attended to adminiſter relief, having or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in my ſerious and great judgment, flann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> cloths dipped in warm herb teas, to be outwardly applied, and ſome bohea tea to take as a collateral, which in the inflamatory ſituation ſhe appeared to be in, I thought muſt be vaſtly beneficial. I alſo ordered barley-water, and by turns a few drops of
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:027681_0179_0FD5DB0C33DEA7F0"/>
acid of elixir in her bohea; yet, notwithſtanding all theſe preſcriptions were conformed to with alertneſs and punctuality, ſhe delayed: I ſay ſhe delayed; which occaſioned another ſkillful phyſician to be ſent for from St. Farme; and after his arrival, I was notified to give my attendance, which ſummons I immediately gave obedience to; and it being about three quarters of a mile, I drove pretty briſk on foot, until I came to the houſe where my <hi>bone fam,</hi> or good woman lay, and rapped at the door, and near as poſſible to reſemble a great man; and having a doctor's ſhaped hat, entered the door, big with phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, and approached the doctor, who was ſeated in a chair: I ſay I approached him, and that with the moſt profound reſpect. He aroſe to pay me a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment, on which I diſcovered he was a man of a good ſize, and by his ruffles and dreſs, concluded he could ſpeak French, &amp; a noble aſpect was in his phiz. I read that two great doctors were ſaluting each other, by way of bowing, nodding, and glancing at each other. Our preſent compliments ended by my ſeating the doctor. I then aſked my patient, with ſomewhat more emotion of mind than was uſual, how her health was. She anſwered <hi>deces maw,</hi> or ſlowly. I made ſtrict inquiry whether my orders had been attended to, and was fearful ſome neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect had taken place; but was anſwered ſatisfactorily. I felt of her pulſe, examined her tongue and eyes, calling on my brother doctor to ſtand by and hear the examination, ſhewing my medicine, except my tea, which I told him was an American herb, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced her <hi>micure,</hi> or better: at which ſhe ſaid ſhe thought ſhe was, although ſeeble. We agreed ſhe was feeble, but was in hopes of her recovery—on which we feated ourſelves, and I had another view of my brother doctor. His eyes were of a
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:027681_0180_0FD5DAE50BC34E88"/>
lightiſh caſt and beſpoke malice, although apparently full of ſubmiſſion, as I thought he ſeemed rather awed at my preſence, having the fame of a great ſurgeon. However, after a few ſurveys on each other, and now and then a word, I aroſe with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, and aſked him a civil queſtion, which was no leſs than to take a ſmall walk to conſult about the good <hi>fam.</hi> He obeyed my ſummons; and after we were from the itching eyes of the whole world, I recapitulated the whole of my performances, and looked on her to be ſo feeble that medicine was uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. He pronounced judgment in my favor; for in his great opinion, he did not know, at ſo infeebled a ſituation, of any medicine that would afford relief: ſtill we unanimouſly agreed, <hi>nem. con.</hi> to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate for a few minutes, if any medicine could be thought of for the woman's relief. A ſilence enfu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and we walked penſive and ſlow, wheeled with judgment and compoſure, caſting up and down, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing angles and triangles in our contemplations; and to be ſure, to ſee my brother doctor (who I ſuppoſe knew very little more of phyſic than myſelf) in ſo deep a ſtudy, was a trial for me to endure; for I thought frequently, in ſpite of every effort, I ſhould have laughed aloud on the ſpot. At length I ſpoke to the doctor; on which he accoſted me in full po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs, when I demanded if he had thought of any thing for the uſe of the patient? he ſhook his head. Again, he was aſked if he thought on any outward application, except what had already been tried? He ſhook his head. Again, I aſked what he thought of her? He ſhook his head, and ſaid <hi>mallard,</hi> which is bad. Can medicine do any good? He ſhook his head, and ſaid no again. Will not a little roſemary be of uſe? He ſaid <hi>we,</hi> or yes. We then judiciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreed on diet, and a few roſemary drops to be
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:027681_0181_0FD5DB35754E7430"/>
given to aſſiſt the ſtomach. A ſmall quantity was given in a phial. I told my patient to keep good courage, that we were in hopes of her life. My doctor confirmed the ſame. After which I, being a man of buſineſs, was about leaving the houſe, and offered my hand to the doctor, by way of farewel, and aſked, while our hands were ſhaking—Doctor, will you viſit the patient again? He ſhook his head.—Will you viſit me me? He ſhook his head—Will you come if again called on by me? He anſwered, yes. Theſe queſtions being over, I then read that a phyſician's hand had hold of a phyſician's hand, and great hands they were, particularly as to phyſic. Our bodies were brought forward with regularity and decorum, and<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a due regard to our feet being properly placed, having my eye the whole time up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my brother doctor, who appeared to be a Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian and a man of good parts; his hair white, red noſe, ſhort waiſted coat, clumſy under clothes and parts which they covered. I had the honor of his company to the door, and he wiſhed me good ſpeed.</p>
            <p>March 17. It being Sabbath day, on which I have more retirement than on other days of the week, ſome occurrences are brought to my mind, which have happened in life, particularly in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. It was a cuſtom to keep St. Patrick's day, which I believe very few knew the meaning of, and I muſt confeſs to be ignorant of the cauſe to this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute; yet it was a cuſtom, like many other cuſtoms that have a tendency to folly. How much more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving would it be, to endeavor to ſeaſon the mind with reaſon, and reſolve to have the intellectual part governing and directing me to love and even embrace all the diſpenſations of Providence towards me; to preſerve the dignity placed in the breaſt pure and undiſturbed, and amid a croud of imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:027681_0182_0FD5DBBBAF21E718"/>
ſtill be calm, and follow with a graceful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence the dictates of ſound reaſon; never ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt truth, or acting againſt juſtice; nor ever quit the road which leads to the true end of life.</p>
            <p>Thurſday, 21. We have begun to prepare troughs for making ſugar, which made my hands ſore enough.</p>
            <p>Sunday, 24. My poor carcaſe is pretty much worn in the ſugar preparation, having cut wood, dug troughs, dug ſnow, and what not. I am rack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every joint; my limbs are ſtiff, the nerves throb, and convulſed feelings pervade my whole frame, and to add to my comfort, I am called on to go two miles to bleed a poor man, and cannot of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience aſk any pay.</p>
            <p>I have paid my patient his viſit, and on my return, found a man who yeſterday left town, and he informs me, that the news of peace is vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. What ſhall I now ſay! However, in this jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal a remark will not be amiſs: for in ſpite of my pretended efforts, I am ſunk to the centre; for ſo contraſted a meſſage, ſtrikes the root of all my hopes. But ſurely the day is at hand: I will never give it up. How am I toſſed on this life's tempeſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſea. Yeſterday the mind (though the body was digging in ſnow) was like a veſſel with her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Our imaginations ſpread far and wide; we ſail on the imaginary billows, but do not fathom the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the ocean on which we are embarked; for life is often compared to the troubled ſea, a warfare, &amp;c. therefore let this teach me, that all earthly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments ſhould be my ſchoolmaſter, to aid me in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>or permiſſion to make ſugar. The labor that I have gone through for ſome days paſt, has a tendency to divert the mind, but there is ſtill a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy impreſſion, which is encreaſed by ſome converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Capt. Smith and I have had on the immortality of the ſoul; as ſome pretend there is no ſurviving after death; ſome will agree that the ſoul lies dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant, and will not awake until the morning of the reſurrection, when it will riſe up and appear as from an over night's ſlumber. Theſe are weighty ideas; but I hold, with Cato, that the ſoul is ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in its exiſtence, and will flouriſh forever in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal youth; for it is ever on the wing, by day and by night, ſearching after new hidden objects, building caſtles in the air, and, as Doctor Young ſays, walking among the ſtars. The mind being never inactive, is a great proof that the ſoul is too noble to ceaſe; for in caſe of its being dormant after death, that part of eternity which was begun in man when he became a living ſoul, muſt be loſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the firſt embryo of man's creation, I am ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of opinion, it is for nothing ſhort of an endleſs duration. But ſuch meditations are too deep for me, who am of a weak underſtanding, and wanting in education: but ſo far I will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ay—that theſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are my own, and not borrowed, as Captain Smith differs with me in this part. He is a man of ſenſe, but in this I think he is erroneous.</p>
            <p>Friday, 29. Yeſterday and laſt night we had a remarkably ſevere ſnow ſtorm. The young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men went laſt night to the houſe of worſhip, where a maſs was held. The women continued the whole night in the chapel, in order to keep watch, or to commemorate the night in which our Saviour was betrayed. Their forty days lent finiſhed yeſterday,
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:027681_0184_0FD5DB19E2A216C0"/>
and this being the day on which they hold Chriſt was crucified, they eat no breakfaſt, although they have not taſted of meat in forty days, and the day is held very ſolemn, with a general maſs. It muſt be confeſſed by all who are ſpectators to all their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent modes of worſhiping, that no people can take more pains to go to heaven than they do; and as to their pinning their ceremonies on their ſleeve, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſome obſervations, what is that to me, or another, ſince they are up and doing? They cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſhew more rationality in this, than in making no pretence towards devotion; and they will poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively ſay, that it is their duty to worſhip, and by ſeriouſly ſerving God, and commemorating our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's different paſſions whilſt on earth, they truſt will finally be a means of making them happy.</p>
            <p>For my part, it is not my intention to ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the Roman Catholic religion, although I believe the firſt foundation of it to have been a good inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for inſtance, their commemorating our Saviour's different ſcenes on earth, I think cannot be amiſs; though I find no ſcripture to order it. But there have ſeveral enormities crept into their church through the deſign of the popes, biſhops, prieſts, &amp;c. that in fact the people are real vaſſals and ſlaves to the prieſts, who ought to be their ſhepherds, inſtead of their tyrants! therefore I think it a miraculous hand of providence that the eyes of ſome were ſo awakened, and the firmneſs of others ſupported in attempting to revolt from ſuch errors; and this to me is a great evidence of the authentici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>or nothing ſhort of the aid of Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence could have carried on the Proteſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion at ſo dark a day, when the whole power of the Roman government was in oppoſition, both the civil and eccleſiaſtical, which led to martyrdoms and
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:027681_0185_0FD5DB01331E3650"/>
every kind of cruelty; and it is recorded in the hiſtory of England, that in the reign of Queen Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſo many were burnt by martyrdom, that it made fire-wood ſcarce. Theſe things muſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my opinion, have been done through an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtic zeal. In my retired moments, my pen and thoughts are my only comforts, and I am led to think that nothing can be more ſweet than thoſe things which are agreeable to that nature which tends to wiſdom, ſimplicity of intentions, and a pure and God-like ſincerity; theſe added to outward acts of devotion; muſt ſecure the mind, and keep the thoughts from ſoaring after objects which cannot be attainable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antoninus</hi> juſtly obſerves, that if God has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But ſome will ſay, "I have it in my power to relieve myſelf," when he owes his exiſtence to God, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he does not deign to petition the Supreme Being, yet that very Maker and Preſerver relieves him in diſtreſs.

            <p>Monday, April 1, 1782. This morning having ſome buſineſs with Mr. Dunning, I deſcended pretty early to his quarters, and was ſaluted by the family with a <hi>bone jure,</hi> or good morning. They aſked me if we were going to tap our trees to day, in order to make ſugar? I anſwered in the affirmative; they replyed, that this and to-morrow were holy days to
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:027681_0186_0FD5DBBD2C664D70"/>
them, and that if we commenced working on either of theſe days, God would blaſt our undertakings. I expreſſed to them our unwillingneſs to labor on their worſhipping days, which I ſhould deem as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement, provided we trouble them; but as we were urged by motives of neceſſity, occaſioned by our being priſoners, and having no ſupport except a common ſoldier's ration, together with its being good weather, and the ſeaſon far advanced, induced us to undertake the diſagreeable taſk:—but all to no purpoſe. They inſiſted that their prayers would gain us more ſugar if we delayed a few days. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, that I believed both their prayers and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to be good, but as to looking for miracles in our neceſſary callings, I could not be full in the faith. They ſtill perſiſted, and recapitulated the many mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles God had wrought for them:—I told them it was a great bleſſing if Providence was ſo favorable in ſuch extraordinary aids, and that neither the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholics nor Proteſtants had a right to doubt of his goodneſs; but on the religious part, I profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed we did not look for miracles; and that if my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory ſerved, that they had met with inſtances of diſappointments, for they could not kill nor drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the graſshoppers and other inſects the two laſt ſummers. The old lady was about leaving her bed when ſhe ſprang up in a great rage, and we had the whole family to encounter, the wife, huſband, daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, &amp;c<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but I like a great ſoldier, kept the field, and heard their harrangues, which was a loud <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>clat upon this and that miracle; and recapitulated more than ever they or I ſhall know. The old woman appeared the moſt in earneſt, and after her whiſtling pipe was nearly expended, ſhe ran to Dunning, and in a low and faultering voice, ſaid—"Monſieur Dunning, if you will believe me, if our old prieſt
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:027681_0187_0FD5DADC88079678"/>
had not been ſo deviliſh lazy laſt ſummer in praying, he might have deſtroyed all the inſects, as the prieſt before him had done, for the Curate or prieſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> who lived here before, would kill ſo many that they could be ſcraped up by hands-ful." We did not adhere to the people, and having a commander (a large Dutchman whom Smith and I appointed, and an old experienced warrior in the ſugar boiling) the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing orders appeared, and were ſtrictly attended to.</p>

            <p>Eight o'clock. The drums do beat, a courier is diſpatched to inform the General that the army is ready to advance, and waiting now for orders.</p>

               <p>Mentus (by himſelf.) The day hangs heavy.</p>
               <p>My Generals and men are brave; but the enemy are hardy. And what a ſight is this; on the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious plains now ruddy to the ſight, are many for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever loſt.

An awful interval ſeems at hand between the birth of plots, and the lives of thouſands, and may finally over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and be the diſſolution of kingdoms, to ſatisfy ambition. Our generals take ſome reſpite, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double the onſet. We again view Bajezet and Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantic, collecting all their force. Their brows are knit; they rally again and advance with horror in every wrinkle of their viſage. They will accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late revenge, and meet their enemy with terror thick as hapleſs Egypt ever felt. Bajezet and Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantic gains the ground, inch by inch, purchaſed dear. Smoak iſſues as from mount Etna, thick as ſabled mid-night darkneſs. All is clangor and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſtation. The carnage is invincible. But methinks I hear another ſound. Our chief reſumes his former ſhrine; the enemies give way; their columns are broken; victory is proclaimed. Bajezet and Gigantic has made the conqueſt compleat. Their colours are flying, red with ſucceſs. The enemies are ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into worlds unknown, and they like hardy aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, overtake and captivate the rear. Sol with his beams will ariſe from the eaſtern horizon, and with his radient glory ſalute their arrival.</p>

            <p>Sabbath, April 21. The face of nature once more begins to reſume an agreeable aſpect. The earth, our ancient and firſt mother, again makes her appearance, after having been ſmothered for nearly ſeven months in ſnow. I cannot but obſerve how rejoiced every thing in this country appear at the departure of ſo large a bulk of ſnow. The lowing of cattle, return of birds, &amp;c. all ſeem to join in one univerſal choir, to welcome the beauties of the earth, which I was never ſo ſenſible of as ſince liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this country. This globe, interwoven as it is with hills, dales, rivulets, and the interſperſion of landſcapes, with the variety of colours, all preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to view, is ſomething grand and pleaſing, and beſpeaks a great forming hand. The old philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſeemed to vie with each other who ſhould moſt extal the grandeur and pleaſantneſs of this immenſe globe, and were willing to return to her again. Xenophon, in deſcribing the life of his prince as a pattern of good nature and charity in all his differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſcenes of life, deſcribes him, even on his death bed, as being pleaſed with the reflection, that while the ſoul returned to him who made it, his body would incorporate with the great mother of all things, and by that means become beneficial to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, for which reaſons he gave his ſons poſitive or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders

not to enſhrine his body in gold or ſilver, but to lay it in the earth as ſoon as the life was gone out of it. What a noble inſtance of humility, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent of philanthropy, was here! How different from the deſcription of Harvey, where he ſpeaks of the timorouſly nice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reature who dared hardly to venture her foot upon the gravel, but now a naked, ghaſtly ſkull. And I am of opinion that every real chriſtian who expects e're long to be compleatly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in the celeſtial realms of everlaſting bliſs, free from troubled ſeaſons and angry ſkies, feels as little concern on reflecting that their mortal part muſt mingle with the duſt, as Xenophon's prince did.</p>
            <p>April 24. The inhabitants begin to ſow their wheat, although large ſnow banks are on the ſides of the fields, by the ſences.</p>

            <p>May 1. The ſnow is chiefly gone, except in banks; but nature looks as dead, with reſpect to vegetation, as in January.</p>
            <p>Tueſday, 14.

He is a droll man, is from Old France, and warmly attached to the Britiſh crown; and his reaſons for the favorable wiſhes he appears to have for that empire, ſeems
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:027681_0195_0FD5DAFBA9686720"/>
grounded on a deſire, that a balance of power may ever be kept up; and ſays he would be ſorry to ſee one nation riſe ſuperior to another: but as all at preſent are balanced, he wiſhes that concordance may continue, and ſeems apprehenſive that if Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica ſhould be independent, the crown will loſe that weight of balance which it ought to have; although he appears to have a deſire that the Americans may not be enſlaved, but may be ſet on the ſame footing as before the war, which ſentiment agrees with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracts from two letters intercepted, and which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Quebec Gazette, ſaid to be written by Mr. Deane, in France; one was directed to his brother in Virginia, and the other to Major Tall-man, at General Waſhington's head quarters, ſet<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ting forth himſelf to be much dejected on account of the conteſt with Great Britain, pointing out ſo many difficulties, and the vaſt expence it will occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould we become free and independent ſtates. He urges that, in his opinion, we could make a peace with that crown honorable to ourſelves, and advantageous to both England and America, and a firm eſtabliſhment to the proteſtant faith; but if England ſhould be too far reduced, it would be dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous not only to the liberties of America, but to her religion alſo. The date of theſe letters is "Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, May 20, 1781." I do not believe the copy is genuine; but I fear ſome remarks relative to the proteſtant religion may, in caſe England ſhould be reduced, prove too true; as the Canadians make no ſcruple of telling us, that if France reduces Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, they will make them and the Americans be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Roman Catholics. Mr. Duran ſays, that he does not think it right to perſecute people for their religious ſentiments, and he thinks the Proteſtants can go to heaven as well as the Catholics; but ſays
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:027681_0196_0FD5DAEA69114A58"/>
the Proteſtant clergy have a much eaſier way: they marry and have families, and pray now and then:—but the Roman Catholic prieſts cannot marry; they muſt riſe every morning and attend to prayers until nine o'clock, and then confeſs the people till twelve, and from two until five; and then to maſs at ſeven conſtantly. Indeed I muſt ſay, that I never ſaw any man ſo faithful in prayer as the one I am now writing of. He riſes exactly at ſix in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in winter and ſummer (as I have often paſſed by the church in the ſummer, and always heard the bell ring at ſix, and never failed of finding him at prayer.) Sometimes he walks back and forth bye the meeting houſe, when there are not people to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend prayers; and I fully believe, if the king of France was to paſs him in his devotion, he would not appear to take any notice of him. Indeed he ſays, that if the king goes bye when they are at prayer, he takes his hat off, or if he even paſſes a church, ſmall chapel, or croſs; and I never ſaw any, from the grey head to the youth, paſs a meeting houſe, croſs, or the like, but they walk with their hats off, and put up a ſhort prayer. I was once in a boat in the river St. Lawrence, with ſeveral Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadians, who, on paſſing a church, all went to prayer. How far this is right let every one judge.</p>
            <p>How natural it is for the mind to be anxious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the cares of this world! And indeed we are ſent into it to act our part upon the great theatrical ſtage, and if we do not perform our temporary, as well as ſpiritual, warfare aright, we fall ſhort of acting with propriety that part for which we were deſigned. I have often reflections about my two poor little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren whom I left in infancy: but they are under the guidance of a guardian God. Still it is neceſſary and right that they ſhould be educated, which I truſt
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:027681_0197_0FD5DB1826C8F098"/>
they will; but if it ſhould pleaſe the Great Parent of the dear pledges to arrange them among thoſe who ceaſe to be, let me learn contentment; always remembering how uncertain are all ſublunary objects. Some are haſtening into being, and ſome are haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be no more, on earth. Theſe changes renew the world, and ever preſent new parts of the infinite eternity that lies before us; therefore, what is there in this rolling tide, which is conſtantly flowing and ebbing, worthy of our attachment, any more than if we ſhould grow fond of a ſparrow flying? We ſhould conſider life as now finiſhed, and what little ſurplus remains, ſhould he ſpent agreeable to God.</p>
            <p>May 15. I read the king's ſpeech of the 27th of November laſt, in which he gives information to his parliament of the loſs of his army in Virginia, which he ſays calls loudly for a more ſpirited exertion in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to reſtore peace to his deluded ſubjects. Poor man! he has not been the inſtrument of cauſing blood enough to be ſhed as yet, particularly on our frontiers; and yet is very unwilling to burthen his ſubjects with new taxes. I cannot believe the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh empire will ever proſper for their cruel and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage treatment to the Americans; and I ſhould not wonder if, at ſome future day, the judgments we now undergo from their oppreſſion ſhould fall on their own heads; and whatſoever meaſures they meet, ſhould be meaſured to them again, although they may have no Indians to fear: but I pray that ſomething reſembling them may ſcourge thoſe who have been the inſtruments of ſcourging us. I view the United States as a free and independent empire, although further pretended Britiſh exertions are threatened, in order to reduce us to obedience; and the language of the hardy Britons, cry aloud that it muſt be ſo. I can hear nothing but that the obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:027681_0198_0FD5DBF4F0545C38"/>
of the Americans will be the only means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring peace: but the ſtory is ſo old, that it appears <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uite thread-bare to me, and I gueſs pretty much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to them. This, however, is my own opinion, for I am cooped up in this corner of the globe, like a moving ſtatue, deprived of every kind of uſe to my country and fellow creatures: for as to my doctor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, had I ever ſo much cuſtom, it would be as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as Davis's ballad, the title of which was "a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

General Haldimand, the commander is not omnipotent, but no being in a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized power is more arbitrary—for all kinds of loud news that has the leaſt favor towards the Americans, is kept out of the province; even the king's ſpeech did not appear in the newſpapers here: I read it in an Engliſh paper ſent me by a friend. Aſk a man for news, and he will whiſper that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

However, they cannot deprive me of thinking, and I will think that there is a war between Great Britain on one part, and America, France, and the Netherlands on the other part; that for and in conſideration of the ſum of fifty millions ſterling, on the part of Britannia, to be paid by the oppreſſion of her ſubjects, at five per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, annually, until the principal and intereſt ſhall be paid, and the loſs of about thirty thouſand troops by ſword, death and deſertion; and finally, poor Britain! poor Britain! I would have you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, although you have fought, you will be obliged to ſubmit: for it will never do for the Americans to be bound to help pay off the leaſe.</p>
            <p>16th. A man came from Quebec this morning for Newcomb Blodget, our waiter, who is exchanged, and we received letters from Mr. Murray inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:027681_0199_0FD5CD062267A9B8"/>
us that we might write to our friends; but the captain hurried off ſo faſt, that we had no opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. It beſpeaks a great man, and a great man he is, having at this very time, ſix men under his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate command. However, he is bound for Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bec with a fair wind, and appears a man of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The French for this week paſt have faſted, having eat no meat, except on Thurſday, which was kept as holy time; but the women have every day attended on maſs and the men as often as they could, to pray for a bleſſing on the enſuing crops. It is a cuſtom, whenever a man begins to plow, or at the time he goes into the field to make a begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to take his family with him, and they all aſk a bleſſing on their labour, &amp;c. by kneeling down to prayer.</p>
            <p>21ſt. We wrote a petition to Congreſs, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them of our diſtreſs, and ſetting forth that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers from the continental army, being captive in a ſtrange land, were not a little chagrined to find themſelves ſo reduced and neglected by their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as to be obliged to cut wood for the Canadians at twenty-four coppers a cord (which is one ſhilling Halifax) and expoſed to inſult from every Britiſh upſtart, and aſked if we are not aſhamed to ſerve ſuch a body of men. However, we diſpiſe ſuch queſtions and the authors of them, more than we do cutting wood; but we are in a hobble. Were we ſervants or hirelings, we would try and make the beſt of it; but here we are, and here we may be found, gentlemen beggars, outcaſts, and in one ſenſe anathematiſed. What a beautiful figure we cut in this place! We ſtrut about with an empty purſe and a ragged coat. And what makes the buſineſs more intolerable, is, that we are ſenſible it is not for want of abilities in Congreſs, but a defect, in

Poor Smith hangs his under lip, and ſeems more in the dumps than any of us; ſtill it would be a reviving thought to have the meſſage arrive for our departure once more to our native country; and no wonder, ſince we have been almoſt three years priſoners, add to which a ſtrong anxiety to know how our country fares, relative to the war, and the finances for the ſupport of the army, and with me, my dear children. How is my heart clung to their infancy, and concerned for their education; but I truſt, that he who formed them will be a guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian parent to the now fatherleſs babes.</p>
            <p>Sunday. We all went to maſs except Smith, who appears ſullen. It is one of their grand faits, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly days, and is to continue three days, wherein no labor is to be done. There was a full, and what the French call <hi>Belle Aſſembly.</hi> The preacher is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make any perſon by turns laugh, and his actions before the altar is very odd; his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clothes are made of brown linen, near as courſe as top-ſail duck, and his ſhirt nearly related to its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor breeches, but he has a great deal of money, as is ſaid, and is very miſerly, which the people ſay is his failing. He has a large red noſe which beſpeaks wine.</p>
            <p>Saturday, 25th. This day my land-lady's mother died, after a ſtrange and lingering diſorder, which very much prevails in this country, and generally proves fatal, particularly to the aged. They are taken with a puking up every thing which the ſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach receives, with an exceſſive heat and boiling in the bowels, and are ſo coſtive that medicine or clyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:027681_0201_0FD5DBCD2D501130"/>
are of no uſe; neither the Engliſh or their own doctors can remove the cauſe, as every application of medicine is uſeleſs. She died in the pariſh of St. John's. I frequently, from the friendſhip I had for Mrs. Jaunſeling, went to ſee the old lady, and on one of my viſits, the miniſter from St. John's was there; he appeared a genteel, well bred gentleman, and as far as I could underſtand the language, ſpoke to her with great ſolemnity and ſenſe on her laſt end; and told her to continue ſtedfaſt in prayer to God, and that through the merits of Chriſt and the interceſſion of the bleſſed Apoſtles and the Virgin Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, he was in hopes ſhe would meet with a free par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of all her ſins; ſhe received the ſacrament with devoutneſs of heart, to appearance, and when ſhe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, appeared ſenſible and compoſed. There was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twenty people in the room, who continued on their knees in prayer I believe better than an hour, &amp; as her laſt breath went out of her they aroſe &amp; ſprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kled holy water on the corpſe, which was immediately ſewed up in a ſheet, and the face never more ſeen. Whatever hath been ſaid of the Roman Catholic's, I cannot condemn them for one thing, as they always appear joyful if any of us proteſtants attended maſs or their funerals, and have never aſked us to become Roman Catholic's.</p>
            <p>May 26. A man arrived this morning from Quebec with a letter from Mr. Murray, to inform Mr. Dunning that he is exchanged—And about 12 o'clock he ſet out. By him I wrote letters to my brother John Scudder, Jeremiah Van Renſſalaer, and Doctor Woodruff, at Albany. An inſtance of this kind flags my drooping ſpirits more than any thing I have ever experienced ſince being a priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. His being the whole time in captivity with me, and having lived together for ſome time in one houſe

in friendſhip, together with his good character, (for he is a worthy deſerving young gentleman) makes the the trial more ſevere:—ſtill, I am happy in his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe which has been obtained by friends; but I muſt view myſelf as ſet apart in the world, without a friend to apply for my liberation, and as a forſaken forlorn outcaſt in creation, poor in health, poor for the want of the neceſſary comforts of life, and poor in devotion towards my God—</p>
            <l>My ſpirits flag like withering graſs,</l>
            <l>Burnt with exceſſive heat;</l>
            <l>In ſecret groans my minutes paſs,</l>
            <l>And I forget to eat.</l>

            <l>Far from the tents of joy and hope</l>
            <l>I ſit and grieve alone.</l>

            <p>What a bleſſed ſituation a real Chriſtian muſt be in!—and how happy ſhould I be amid thoſe ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding difficulties which appear to be continually preſenting themſelves anew, could I feel a proper ſubmiſſion to the diſpenſations of my righteous God, with a full belief that all theſe things come form his ſovereign diſpoſal, and, like the prodigal ſon, return to my father and find mercy! Oh! for a heavenly aid to bow this faithleſs, unbelieving heart.</p>

            <p>I have for the winter paſt, and this ſummer, put down in this journal whatever occurrences took the moſt upon my mind; ſometimes on ſerious ſubjects, and, when I felt more chearful, wrote at random; always conſidering that it was a journal: and believe if I had plenty of paper, I ſhould be much more lengthy on many points, for my pen is my greateſt delight—and this puts me in mind of a paſſage in the Spectator, of his friend Sir Roger, who was deeply in love; &amp; being a great ſportſman, whenever his miſtreſs was cruel, the foxes were ſure to pay for it: and when my country appears moſt cruel, my pen is ſure of employment, which has a tendency to ſoften cares, and make the time paſs more eaſily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. But, what do I ſay,—that it makes time paſs more eaſily away, when I have ſo ſhort a ſpace al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed me, at the longeſt, to prepare for a dread e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, which ſurely belongs to me.</p>

            <p>June 3d. Captain Smith and myſelf have this day had ſome converſation on the frailties of man towards his maker, and how feeble his efforts in devotion; and notwithſtanding the Great Author of our exiſtence, is beyond all comprehenſion; he who fills eternity, and at one glance ſurveys millions of the planetary worlds, and the moſt minute things through theſe vaſt and expanſive ſyſtems, ſo that not a hair of the head is paſſed unnoticed; yet in our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes to ſuch a being the mind wanders and loſes its true end, and roves after the fleeting colours of unſubſtantial air. We alſo made ſome remarks on the awful day of days, when a final retribution will take place; and, as Harvey deſcribes, we muſt be attendants on the diſſolution of nature! Then what manner of perſons ought we to be, in order to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the important deſign for which we were ſent into this world? Surely the Almighty never planted theſe heavens, and fixed this extenſive globe, float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with huge mountains, and the great deep, with cities and empires, for man, whom he placed as Lord over all, without a great and important end, and to fulfil his Maker's command. But theſe reflections are too deep for me, a feeble particle of duſt, to

Malice is knit in every Canadian's brow. For my part I am at a loſs how they would proceed by the term they give, of <hi>conjuring</hi> them; but they hold very ſtrenuouſly, that if the Biſhop (which often had been the caſe) gave permiſſion to conjure them away, they never failed; and will tell of great victories obtained over their enemies, or the inſects, which, from what I can learn, have often frequented this country; but all allow they never ſaw ſo many: yet they hold they have driven them by ſhoals into the river, and ſometimes they have killed them dead on the ſpot, ſo that handsful<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Wedneſday, 26. A brig came to anchor oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite where we live, and the Captain of her and two young ladies, came on ſhore; Col. Gordon, Mr. White, and myſelf, waited on them and invited them to my lodgings. The Captain whoſe name is Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, failed from Portſmouth, in England, on the ſecond day of May, and ſays the univerſal talk in England, was peace with America. They continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about two hours, and invited Colonel Gordon on board to receive a preſent, which the Colonel com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, and returned with half a dozen bottles
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:027681_0209_0FD5DBDBEACD9888"/>
of gin. The Captain of the brig was born on Long-Iſland, at a place called Cow Bay, and has brothers and ſiſters there.</p>
            <p>July 4th. This being the ſixth year of our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, we were invited to take an Anniverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry dinner with Colonel Gordon. We paſſed the day agreeably; and from the flattering proſpect of affairs, I truſt before another fourth of July ſhall return, peace with America may be made on laſting and honorable terms.</p>
            <p>Sabbath 7th. All of us who are priſoners went this day to maſs, where the young women as well as the old, were dreſſed in ſtriped homeſpun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

It is really a melancholy ſight.</p>
            <p>Tueſday 9th. All are gone to maſs to make a proceſſion, old and young. The women go without ſtockings and mockaſins, in token of mourning for the calamities in their land.</p>
            <p>Monday 15th. This morning I had a patient to viſit at<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> St. John's, and on my way met about fifty Engliſh ſailors who were going to unload a large ſhip that is caſt away oppoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

Thurſday 10th. I wont to a vendue this day where the owner of the goods bought almoſt the whole, or bid for them in public, which was the man of the houſe; and however droll it may appear, it is the faſhion of this country, if a man loſes his wife and has children, he is obliged to ſell his moveables, and give one half to the children, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s the caſe at the preſent vendue. The wind has blown from the ſouth-weſt for near two weeks conſtantly, during which time we have had no rain, and it being a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable drought, the graſshoppers take the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and eat the wheat; in ſome fields the ears ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be half deſtroyed. What is voided from the inſects, is as large as cheſs, and as thick on the ground as wheat when firſt ſown; but no people appear more in earneſt in devotion that God would impede this judgment, than theſe people. A fifty gun ſhip and a frigate paſſed down the river to day <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Tueſday, July 23. This day is three years ſince being taken a priſoner; and how far it may prove of preſent or future advantage, is hard for me to form the leaſt idea of; but from what former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections I have had and am ſtill impreſſed with, I truſt that theſe things will not be entirely loſt. The fire may in ſome meaſure be extinguiſhed, but ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it will not be wholly forgotten, as I view proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and adverſity as proceeding from the bountiful giver or withholder, at his all Sovereign pleaſure, and we are entirely at his diſpoſal, reſpecting croſſes and diſappointments, or rather adverſe and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous proſpects.</p>
            <p>July 25. Again I have lived to ſee another birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, which makes me thirty-five years of age; and I cannot omit reflecting on the vain uſe that is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

made of the arrival of a birth-day, in particular by Kings, Queens, and renowned men; but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly common ſenſe muſt teach us that one year is elap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and a dread eternity is that much nearer open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

For my part I do not juſtify myſelf; for when I was in the army, and ſince I have been a priſoner in Quebec Jail, although neither great nor renowned, I rejoiced in feaſting and drinking at my own birth, which certainly was hypocriſy; for I never ſaw ſo much comfort in the world yet, as to make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>Auguſt 1ſt. Pleaſant agreeable weather. We catch plenty of pigeons, which are young and very fine, and have a tendency to aſſiſt us along the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney of life, and may be numbered with thouſands of bleſſings which we receive and paſs by without ſcarcely taking notice of.</p>
            <p>Auguſt 4th. Captain Smith received thirty dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars from his wife, which is the firſt relief that has ever been ſent to the priſoners from our country;
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:027681_0212_0FD5DBE386386070"/>
and poor Scudder is yet poor Scudder! Left in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, and no friend to apply to, except my doctor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which is ſome aſſiſtance; but I am too poor a doctor to deceive the people, and they are too poor to pay if they were deceived. The news about peace and my country is favorable—and ſhall I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair? If I ſhould never return, I ſhould be very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle miſſed; ſome might ſay they were ſorry; but it would be like all other things of the kind. But I ſcrawl at random, and think; becauſe Smith has got a little money, and my doctoring of no uſe, that I am not going to return again. This is an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon digreſſion, and I am at a loſs what it is penned for;—however it is down, and I cannot take it up It may remain along with many other remarks in the journal that is like chips in porridge.</p>
            <p>Auguſt 17th. Received a letter from Mr. Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, containing an anſwer to a letter I wrote to Gen. Clark, on account of the ſtoppage of the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of money to the priſoners, in which I begged him to intercede for us; but all to no purpoſe. He informed Mr. Murray, that he would not interfere with the General in our behalf, as he ſuppoſes the Commander in Chief had ſufficient reaſons for his conduct. It poſſitively appears, that all the boaſted Britiſh humanity is fled; nor do I believe they ever were poſſeſſed of that greatneſs of ſoul that has been repreſented, though we were taught ſo to believe—but ſurely we have learned another leſſon: for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, the treatment to the priſoners taken at Fort Waſhington, who were frozen and ſtarved to death in Sugar Houſes, cold Jails, and thouſands died on board of priſon ſhips:—but let them go on; I am proof againſt any further attack, as I have lain in jail until my conſtitution is ruined, and they may now tyrannize, for I ſcorn them from my inmoſt ſoul, and
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:027681_0213_0FD5DBE4EA579D68"/>
hope that not a tory devil will be allowed to exiſt in the United States after peace.</p>
            <p>Tueſday, 20th. From the ſmall ſtock of money I have been able to collect, I have purchaſed a gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon of red wine to make a trial for relief from the diſorder I have ſo long been afflicted with in my bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els. I almoſt diſpair of ever recovering; but if I had ever ſo good a ſtate of health, at laſt I muſt die. Therefore, ſickneſs, pains and impriſonments, ought to make me familiar with ſo great a change. Death is like our birth, a myſtery of nature.</p>
            <p>Saturday, Auguſt 24, 1782. My being particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to the day, month and year, is, that laſt evening Col. James Gordon, Lieutenant White, Lieutenant Banter, and Enſign Banter, made their eſcape, or deſerted. We ſuppoſe it was a matter which had for ſome time been under conſideration. At any rate they are gone, and we ſuppoſe have broke their paroles, and embarked down the river.</p>
            <p>Tueſday, 27th. Laſt night a man came from Quebec, with a letter to inform Captain Smith he is exchanged, and this morning he ſat off for home. In him I have loſt, I believe, a ſincere friend, a good companion, and a man of ſenſe. His company was agreeable, of a merry turn, but very ſtriking on ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſubjects; his reaſonings are improving and agreeable. Farewel my good friend, may you live comfortably the remaining days you may have left, die in peace, and leave a bleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind you, whilſt my little barque glides ſlowly after; and may we both enter into reſt (which is a thought too great for frail mortals to dwell on) but ſuch we are told will happen to thoſe who earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly ſeek aright, and the prize is ſo great, who would not haſten to be an adventurer? It is a fair and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble chance, and there is nothing in this life worthy
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:027681_0214_0FD5DBE6D57024D8"/>
of our anxiety or cares. It is a troubled ocean at beſt, and thoſe who have landed ſafe upon the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of our Great Emanuel, are bleſſed unſpeakably indeed. I am left alone, not a perſon who can ſpeak Engliſh, but all are Canadians, and I ſpeak ſuch poor French, that it is hard to talk with them, but I will wait with calmneſs, not forgetting that he who reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth captive priſoners, will alſo deliver me from this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined ſtate, at his gracious will. The time is faſt approaching, when all theſe different changing ſcenes in life will lie down and be forgotten; although I hold that the ſoul does not loſe the thought of the tribulated ſtage it has paſſed through, as it is reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that no part of annihilation can take place after the ſoul leaves the body. For inſtance, when the ſoul is loſt and forever miſerable, that which creates and makes the miſery, is the reflection of having miſpent the opportunities which were offered whilſt here on earth and a guilty conſcience makes a hell, miſerable far beyond human conception; therefore, ſhould any part of annihilation take place, or the ſoul forget its being on earth and miſuſing theſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, it would be ignorant of what it was pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed for. It is juſt the ſame with thoſe who die happy; for the ſcripture ſays, that thoſe who thro' many tribulations are clothed in white, ſo the thought of paſſing through a tempeſtuous life, in pains, ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, trials and temptations, all add to fill the mind with expanſive views, beyond the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>each of a finite mortal to form an idea of. The joys and boundleſs proſpects of a celeſtial a vaſt infinity of eternity, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening more capacious than imagination can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; the ſtring can hardly be touched upon, when hallelujahs will reign, forever and forever.</p>
            <p>Thurſday, 29th. Received a letter from Mr. Murray, adviſing me to make myſelf contented for a
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:027681_0215_0FD5DBEAAF43E638"/>
little time longer, for he expects I will in a ſhort time be exchanged. But if not, the General will permit me to return to the ſtates of America, on pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>role. Such news revives my mind, to think I ſhall once more ſee my native country, which I ſincerely deſire, and that before cold weather, as it very much affects my health, the climate being too frigid. What a noble temper and diſpoſition a man muſt be poſſeſſed of who, under all difficulties and trials, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffers the mind to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>oaring higher and having loftier views than what tends to frail duſt, remembering that he is an adventurer for another world, and that if the road is filled with thorns, let them appear like flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, conſidering our crown is at ſtake, and if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive mercy, no thought can reach the ſmalleſt chord of the bliſs which will compleat our happineſs to all eternity. Therefore what is there in this life that we would not cheerfully ſubmit to, that comes from ſo righteous a providence, who ſpared not his only ſon, but ſuffered him to wear a crown of thorns and die an ignominious death for man who is filled with ingratitude.</p>
            <p>Auguſt 3d. This day we had a violent ſtorm from the northeaſt, or up the river. The wind blew a hurricane, attended with thunder. The people of the houſe were fearful it would blow down. The woman brought out her hemlock boughs which had been conſecrated at church, and threw them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire; ſome holy water was alſo brought, to ſprinkle with, and they then all fell on their knees to prayer, and appeared very fervent; but the ſtorm ſeemed to encreaſe. I expected the roof of the houſe at leaſt would have gone, and felt under great
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:027681_0216_0FD5DBEC742CFEA0"/>
apprehenſions that all of us would loſe our lives. In the midſt of the ſtorm, the young woman who was the only child, about eighteen years of age, jumped from her prayers and flew to my arms for protection, crying aloud, Oh! Monſieur Scudder, guard me and pray for me; on which I anſwered that God was her guard, and it was, according to their belief, of no uſe for Proteſtants to pray. The old man and woman ſprang up and ſaid they did not doubt but God would hear a Proteſtant as ſoon as a Catholic. I told them that I made no doubt but he heard all nations or people that prayed ſincerely, and I deſired to join with them for his aſſiſtance, at the ſame time encouraging them not to be afraid, for that we were in his hands, and made no doubt but the wind would ſoon abate; ſtill I had, for near an hour, a hard ſtruggle to keep the young woman from going into fits. Happily at laſt the ſtorm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ated, and the father and mother ſeemed to regard me for my encouragement to them and their daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp;now ſuppoſe the Proteſtants may go to heaven. I have often mentioned the Roman Catholics in this journal, and really to ſee them in any difficulty fly to the Supreme Being for aſſiſtance, is a circumſtance worthy of attention, as there is ſo reaſonable a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from the Creator to the creature, that not to return our Parent and Maker a thankful heart, is placing us below the common brutes.</p>
            <p>Thurſday, 15th. I have for ſometime neglected putting any of my phyſical proceedings down in this journal, in particular relating to the woman who lives near Montreal, on account of my mind being taken up with more ſerious matters; but man is of a changeable diſpoſition, ſo now proceed to put down ſome ſketches of my practice, leaſt it may be loſt. In the firſt place, as is my uſual practice in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:027681_0217_0FD5DBEC77EE7370"/>
every diſorder, I hold her, and then prepared a bottle of good madeira, with the filings of ſteel put therein, out of which two large phials were filled and the remainder left in the quart bottle; this is to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the blood, and indeed all nature. The decoction of cortex was put in two p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ials more, as a bracer; the acid of elixir to aſſiſt the appetite, and a phial of camphor to keep off the fever, with two phials of ſtrong bohea. Thus were almoſt all my phials filled, and my patient's room looked like a ſmall apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's ſhop. The reaſon of this was, I expected ſhe was rich, and there was caſh to be had. An iſſue was alſo ordered, and the whole conducted with judgment: and I find my patient is no worſe, nor indeed much better; however, ſhe is not very ſick. Her father generally takes me out in a horſe cart, and when I get on my three ſquare hat, (for modeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's ſake I muſt not ſay a cocked hat) I ſay when this hat is put on my head, the brim of it being large, (which was allowed through the clemency of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannia's generalliſſimo of this province) and I placed along ſide of my old friend in the horſe-cart, we draw the attention of a great many ſpectators, particularly the dogs; for the rattling of the cart and a trail of dogs which never eſcape us (as they ſeem to know our ſound) with their yelling and bowwowing, one dog bringing out another, and thus we are accoſted for four miles<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> together, which with our gibberage, when we can be heard, all contribute to make a jargon not eaſily underſtood. One thing is very extraordinary, and that is—how theſe dogs ſhould take ſo much notice of me, being an entire ſtranger to them, but knowing the ſagacity of thoſe animals, they often ſtir up my jealouſy, ſor I am like the world of mankind who are more or leſs jealous, in particular if they undertake what they are unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:027681_0218_0FD5DBEEF897DE88"/>
with. So my feelings are worked up, and I am ſometimes inclined to believe that they think as I think, that I am no doctor; or why ſhould they make ſuch a plaguy rout every time I go, and ſeem to let me return in peace. However I diſregard what they ſay, knowing dogs to be dogs, although in this caſe they are cunning dogs.—I have alſo been called on to bleed the old Prieſt's houſe-keeper, and went a ſabbath morning, expecting to bleed her and then go to maſs, but was rather later than I expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and met the parſon going to church, who thus accoſted me, <hi>bone jure Monſieur Scudder?</hi> (how do you do Mr. Scudder) are you going to bleed the young woman? I anſwered I was. He ſhook his head, and ſaid no pau poſſible—I aſked why? He ſaid ſhe was too groſs, and no doctor or perſon bad or could ever bleed her. I ſaid that perhaps ſhe never had tried a Boſtonian ſurgeon. He replied no. I then laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at him, and told him the Boſtonians always went through with what they undertook. It may be was his anſwer. I then proceeded to the houſe where my great luſty patient was ſitting with her feet in warm water; ſhe was as heavy as two of the old prieſt put together. I aſked her if ſhe meant to be bled in the foot? She anſwered in the affirmative, and I proceeded to tie up her leg; but no more of a vein appeared, than on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aſin; I tied up her arm, but to no purpoſe. At laſt I perceived a vein appeared full juſt back of her toes, near the fore one, and ventured to put the lancet in, which made her bleed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>inally contributed to raiſe my fame. In ſhort, my lancet, and now and then a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartic, with this and that which I hobble through with, gets me a conſiderable income of late, and it really begins to flatter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

a ſurgeon or doctor; and theſe flatteries will remain until I am put to the teſt, and then what a figure I ſhall cut, like a quack as I am! But one thing is certain, and this certain thing is, that I am not the only quack that practices in America, or Europe; for many pretended doctors are quacks, and many trumped up prieſts are quacks, ſome merchants, attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies &amp; mechanics are quacks; farmers, ſhip-builders, boat builders, ſcow-builders, balloon-builders, ſteam-boat builders, nay my memory will not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>rve, nor paper admit, neither can I enumerate the quacks: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, my advice from experience is, to all manner of perſons, friends or foes, never to undertake, a piece of buſineſs, particularly when difficulty attends, without having a thorough knowledge of what they are about to undertake, except in my ſituation; for I muſt plead my own cauſe. I do not mean here to caſt any reflections, but only to adviſe; for the more regular or experienced perſons are in their lawful avocations; the more uſeful they can be in their call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and it cannot be expected that a man who ſerved two or three years can be equal in knowledge and experience to thoſe who ſerved ſeven. With regard to trumped up prieſts, I look upon the bible to be of ſo myſterious a nature, that the man who undertakes to open and explain thoſe ſublime truths which the ſcriptures are filled with, and be a teacher, ought to be a man who has education and a clear and good underſtanding. Some will pretend to go by the ſpirit; but miracles are not wrought now a days; and it is either ignorance or ſelf-deluſion. However, I hold that the ſpirit aſſiſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all men; but no man can be aſſiſted, only by the labour of the hands of mind, or elſe I might be a good doctor; for the ſpirit is willing, but it is new to me, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot underſtand it, and cannot practice,
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:027681_0220_0FD5DBF4EC147C20"/>
only through deception; and this muſt be the caſe with any branch, civil or religious, where they know but little of what they undertake.</p>

            <p>September 24. The man who took my letter to Quebec, has returned without an anſwer, Mr. Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray being in the country.

            <p>September 29. My phyſical finances being rather too low for the relief of all my brother officers, we concluded all hands to cut wood for one day, at the extravagant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wages of thirty ſous per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He had alſo one other advantage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his men, which is neceſſary for all field-officers, he had not much occaſion of making many ſteps to finiſh trimming his tree.

October 1ſt. Our goods arrived this day at ten o'clock, amounting in the whole to fourteen ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings worth (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>alifax money, at five ſhillings for each rix dollar,) and among ſaid arrivals, were for each of us, two ſtout ſtemmed large bowled pipes, built much in the form of the Canadians, or their horſes, being peculiarly clumſy, the ſtem ſix inches in length, and the bowl about one inch in diameter, and of conſequence they ſeldom needed charging, which was an advantage to men of induſtry. Our rum was not ſo cloſely inſpected into, being thirſty for that kind of liquid, occaſioned us, as in all other caſes where love is at the bottom, to overlook ſome of its <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ad qualities. We all aſſembled together at one place, which was no other than the doctor's quarters, and took dinner, when our liquor, pipes and tobacco ſmoked for it. The remaining part of our ſtores were equally divided, and about the ſetting ſun, every man to his quarters.</p>
            <p>October 2d. A droll circumſtance happened laſt night to one of my brother officers; I ſuppoſe he was ſomething thirſty in the evening, and drank a diſh of ſtrong tea, which made him vapory. He imagined the houſe was in flames, and bawled and hallowed ſo loud that the man of the houſe had to run for the ſurgeon. He told me in French that the Boſtonian had loſt his ſenſes—I immediately ſat out in haſte to his lodgings, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ound the poor man almoſt frightened to death. He told me he was dying, for that ſtreaks of fire were flying out of his eyes, and images continually appearing; and not being able to ſpeak a word of French, their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a general fright and jargon in the whole family; however, I ſoon found out the nature of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint: for the old lady informed me ſhe had made him ſome tea after he was in bed, and that ſhe put a
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:027681_0225_0FD5DBFCB81869A0"/>
handful of tea in the mug, and the man ſoon went crazy. I mentioned the circumſtance to him—gave him ſome water, and on the whole made a cure of the patient. I received a letter from Capt. Smith, mentioning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rontiers, and that peace was in a fair way of taking place. On the whole great encouragement is given to me of being ſoon ſent home.</p>
            <p>October 4th. This day came to this place Mr. Aaron Purbeck, a ſecond Lieutenant, belonging to the ſhip Diſpatch, which was taken by the frigate Pandora. He was three weeks from Salem when captured, and has been priſoner ſix weeks. His crew has gone home, and himſelf detained as an hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. The diſpatch mounted twelve guns, ſix and four pounders. The Pandora has in the courſe of the war taken a number of our American veſſels; but I believe the Captain has uſed the priſoners well. The ſhip Hind of twenty-four guns, is loſt.</p>
            <p>October 6. My doctoring goes on as uſual, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I have lately loſt a patient, who died of age; therefore his life could not be further prolong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, notwithſtanding the judgmatical aſſiſtance of two eminent phyſicians. I am waiting with patience for a departure from this iſland of fortune, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence collecting my debts, dues and demands, and have at this inſtant my phyſical book before me, which I expect will at ſome period appear in this journal; at any rate it contains a number of <hi>Rhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s,</hi> or a great many nothings, if their is ſuch a thing as <hi>nothing.</hi> Upon the whole, was this very account ſet up this day at ſale, I would not give more than thirty-ſix York ſhillings for it, as I verlly believe that all thoſe who intended to pay me, have already done it: and to attempt the riſk of a law-ſuit would be
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:027681_0226_0FD5DBFDB696B370"/>
more whimſical than my practice. Furthermore, ſhould I attempt a law-ſuit with my old cuſtomers, in the firſt place, it would create anger; ſecondly, my abilities might be called in queſtion; and thirdly, I ſhould make a bad defence was that the caſe. Therefore as a man of ſkill, judgment and ſound ſenſe, I think that ſoft words, perſuaſions, &amp;c. &amp;c. is by far the moſt eligible, the moſt peaceable, the moſt harmonious, and to make ſhort of this part of my buſineſs, the moſt concluſive.</p>

            <l>Then learning is moſt excellent.</l>
            <p>A proverb which is applicable to me at this time, particularly in the phyſical line.</p>
            <p>October 10. The happy hour has arrived when we are to take our departure from theſe cold and frigid climes, as a letter has arrived this day at three o'clock, with orders for us to make ready to embark on board a ſchooner, called the Mercury, for New-York, William Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eroc, commander. We all em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked about ſun-ſet, and lay at anchor that night. In the morning early we fell down the river to Paul's Bay, and took on board the priſoners who were there and ſailed to the iſland called Beck, where a fleet lay bound to New-York, at which place we arrived the next morning. The wind blew heavy with a rough ſea. The priſoners and ſome of the ſeamen were very ſea ſick. The Captain had a cat that had kittens, which he ſaid had ſailed with him in the ſhip Hind, which was loſt, for ſeveral years, and in the height of the ſwell, the veſſel being ſmall and rolling very much, the poor cat took ſick, and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two hours died. The Captain appeared to lament her death far beyond what I have ſeen in a parent for the loſs of a child. The cat acted by reaching and puking like a perſon ſea-ſick. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the creature was ſea-ſick or not, is unknown to me; but I believe that was that occaſioned her death; and I would not admit this remark in my journal if I could not prove it by credible witneſſes. It was alſo the Captain's opinion that the ſwell made her ſick.</p>
            <p>About ſun-ſet the wind abated, but a heavy ſea continued. We were divided and put on board of different veſſels. My lot was to go in the Lady Townſend, a large ſhip pierced for 64 guns, and

had been a Spaniſh galeon of eleven hundred tons. The weather was cold and ſtormy. After I had been on board for ſome time, walking on the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-deck, the ſecond mate came and ordered me off, and ſaid no one walked there but gentlemen—I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him of my rank in the American army, and expreſſed a wiſh to ſpeak with the Captain, whoſe name is Auth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>r. He informed the Captain of it, and I was ordered into the cabin. The Captain aſked me what I wanted? I told him that I was a priſoner of war on board his ſhip, and mentioned my rank in the American army—that I had been near an hour on board, expoſed to the cold and rain, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o notice had been taken of me, except that ſome man had ordered me from the quarter-deck, and ſaid gentlemen walked there; I therefore wiſhed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>now the place aſſigned me in the ſhip, as my ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was uncomfortable, and my clothes were wet. He had a number of clerks writing at his table, and appeared to be very attentive to them, without making any reply for ſome time; at laſt he called to his ſecond mate, and told him to take me out of the cabin, for he was not going to be troubled by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in rebellion againſt their Sovereign, and that if I danced, I muſt pay the fidd<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er, or words to that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. However, I ſtill ſtood warming myſelf, when the mate ſaid, "ſirrah don't you mind what is ſaid?" I replied I was warming myſelf. The Captain walked with importance two or three times back and forward on the cabin floor, and then ſaid to me, "Sir, do you intend to obey my orders?" I anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—"yes; but by all the ſhips that the ſovereign you talk of owns, your maſter, Sir Guy Carlton, ſhall know every tittle of your treatment to me,"—and walked out of the cabbin.

than two or three could ſit, and received a ſevere reprimand from the Crony; but I told him—"Sir, abuſe me on your peril." He aſked me who I was? I told him his maſter ſhould know who he was as ſoon as I arrived at New-York; on which he took a more minute ſurvey of me, and walked off. The firſt Lieutenant or mate, was truly a gentleman: he brought me ſome refreſhment, and ſaid I muſt not think much of my treatment, as the Captain had roſe from a boatſwain to his preſent rank, and that he treated him more like a ſcullion than a mate. I had ſome canvaſs to ſleep on; but being wet and having no fire, lay cold that night. The next morning I reſumed my quarter-deck walk, to the no ſmall mortification of the ſecond mate, who was a proper likeneſs in temper and politeneſs to his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, In about an hour the noble Captain appeared on the deck, and walked on one ſide and myſelf on the other; after ſome time he was called to break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt. After breakfaſt he came on deck and reſumed his walk for ſome time, and at laſt ſaid to me—"go into the cabin and take ſome coffee, my boys are now at breakfaſt." I anſwered, "damn you and your cabin, if ever I put my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We lay at anchor by Beck, until the 19th inſtant. The Captain and myſelf had no converſation to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but I meſſed with the mates of the ſhip.
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:027681_0230_0FD5DC090E687DE8"/>
The ſecond mate appeared more pliable; however, I ſaid but little to him, having others to talk with that appeared more agreeable. During our ſtay, the ſnow fell half leg deep, and the weather was cold like winter in Jerſey.</p>
            <p>On the 19th, we all weighed anchor and ſtood down the river with a freſh breeze, keeping the ſouth ſhore in ſight, but ſoon loſt ſight of land on the north-eaſt and eaſt. Nothing material hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened on our paſſage. We ſaw an American ſail that appeared a fine ſtout ſhip, and was ſuppoſed to be an American frigate, but ſhe out-run our ſhip, which was the faſteſt ſailing veſſel in the fleet—The Pandora alſo gave chaſe, but to no purpoſe; we had to return to the fleet, greatly to the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my beloved Captain, who appeared very whiſt until he found ſhe out-went us, and then ſought manfully at the ſight of the rebel's top-maſts. I imagine we were oppoſite Maſſachuſetts Bay, on the diſcovery of the veſſel, which was to the leeward, and on ſight of us hauled her wind, ſo that before ſhe bore away we could diſcover her hull and hands at work; but our ſhip was large, and three frigates in company, it was prudent for her to ſtand off. We diſcovered her about ten in the morning, and made every rag of ſail that could be put on, and by ſun-ſet he ſhip was out of ſight, except her top-maſts, which leaſed <hi>Scudder.</hi> We had a great deal of head <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ieve no other accident happened. On the 13th of November, we arrived at New-York. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to my noble Captain—the old ſaying is, "give
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:027681_0231_0FD5DC0A844FF160"/>
Satan his due"—ſo I will him; for as we drew on the coaſt of New-York, he appeared more ſociable, and actually, on a Sunday, aſked the firſt mate and myſelf to dine with him—We accordingly did; and if my memory ſerves, I never knew the mate to dine with him at any other time; he alſo invited me into his cabin to drink ſome old brandy late at night, a heavy wind blowing and all hands on deck. I concluded a harſh promiſe was better broke than kept; ſtill on my arrival at New-York, had not a word to ſpeak of his favorable treatment, but men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to ſeveral Captains of veſſels whom I ſaw one evening at Mrs. Banks's, his first treatment to me, and they to a man diſapproved of it in the ſtrongeſt terms.</p>
            <p>We continued on board the ſhips until the 16th, during which time I was permitted ſeveral times to go on ſhore, and the afternoon before we left town, the priſoners were all put on board a cartel, veſſel, and General Carlton, that good and humane man, ſent us two kegs of liquors, of ten gallons each, one of the beſt Madeira, and the other of ſpirits. The next morning his aid-de-camp came to ſee if we wanted any thing, and to know what kind of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we had received in Canada and on our paſſage; and herein I confeſs, that by experiencing ſo great a contraſt to the uſage I had before received, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering we were at the eve of peace, made but a ſhort reply, and ſaid that I had ſuffered by the rigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſome; ſtill finding myſelf under the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a man of ſo much philanthropy, and about to embark once more for my native home, ſhould ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend any particular complaint. The evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the priſoners, on receiving their liquors, drank to Sir Guy Carlton, George Waſhington and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, as loud as their voices could roar; and drank
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:027681_0232_0FD5DC0BEBA1B550"/>
bad luck, (or in worſe words) to the tories, thoſe poor reptiles. About ten o'clock, we made ſail up the north river, and was treated by the Captain of the Cartel, with great politeneſs; and what add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our comfort, the General had given expreſs orders for us to have freſh proviſions and every ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for us that was wanting. We lay that night about twenty miles from New-York, and the next day about noon arrived at Dobbs's Ferry, where I confeſs I hardly knew our troops, neither officers or ſoldiers, as their regimentals were altered, and they had a freſher countenance than what appeared either among the Engliſh or German troops, and were hardier ſoldiers, to appearance. I confeſs that it was almoſt impoſſible to look at them with an impartial obſervation; but the Captain himſelf who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Cartel, ſaid he never ſaw finer looking men. I ſat out afternoon for head-quarters, and arrived at New-Burgh that night, in a ſloop; and the next day dined at head-quarters, from whence I went to camp, where I found my old brother officers and ſoldiers hutting themſelves. I continued a few days with them, when I received a horſe from head-quarters, and on the 25th of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember arrived at my native home, after a captivity of three years four months and three days.</p>
            <p>Thus hath ended a long and tedious captivity; for I ſcarcely ever had a well day from the time the Onondaga nation was cut off until the preſent hour; and my affairs by the ravages of the war and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, being much deranged, added to the afflictions that I have before mentioned in this journal, united in rendering my happineſs leſs complete than other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it would have been; ſtill it is my real deſire to return a heart full of thankfulneſs and gratitude to the good hand of Providence, in again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHEN I ſent my Journal to you for publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I acknowledged by a letter, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained many imperfections, and that I felt the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diffidence in having it publiſhed to the eyes of (generally ſpeaking) a cenſorious world; but the reaſons for the attempt were then ſtated; and ſince I have ſo far proceeded, I wiſh to make a few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, which if judged admiſſible, you will place at the end of the journal, that whoever ſhall read may judge of their propriety or impropriety. At the commencement of the late memorable conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween England and America, every true friend of liberty appeared to have a determination to be free, and from the juſtice of the cauſe, and the exertions of a brave and magnanimous people, with the aid of a kind Providence, we were brought to peace, liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and independence, and now enjoy a mild, ſafe and good government, every branch of which is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective, from the higheſt to the loweſt ſtations. Add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this, we are ſituated in a rich and fertile coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, having extended foreſts, navigable rivers and ſpacious harbours; our ſea-ports are crowded with veſſels, wafted from the different ports of the globe, beſides an extenſive commerce of our own, with the fulleſt enjoyment of our ſentiments, both civil and religious, and a ſituation happily remote from Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, that ſeat of oppreſſion, war and bloodſhed:—all theſe are bleſſings which conſpire to make us a happy people indeed. It only now remains for us to endeavor to improve the bleſſings we have, and
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:027681_0235_0FD5DC145EFEFB78"/>
are daily receiving. And firſt, we muſt be guilty of the higheſt degree of ingratitude, if we do not one and all reverence and adore the Supreme Governor of the univerſe, for ſo highly ſignalizing, us with peace and plenty, whilſt our friendly allies, the French are jeopardizing their lives and fortunes againſt deſpotic powers, to obtain thoſe bleſſings we ſo happily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. It ought therefore, not only to excite the prayers of every well wiſher to the rights of man, for a bleſſing on that diſtreſſed nation, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry exertion ſhould be made for their relief, as far as is conſiſtent with the ſafety of the United States.</p>
            <p>Being thus ſettled under a well organized go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, a due regard to our privileges is next in queſtion, &amp; merits a more ſerious diſcuſſion than I am able to give; but this far I may go—that to be at all times prepared for war is the most effectual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to preſerve peace, and prevent injury and inſult, for which end a well diſciplined militia, having a due regard to the laws both civil and military, is highly eſſential. But notwithſtanding difference in ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may prevail, particularly on political topics, yet by theſe different opinions the baſis of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is made more ſecure than if a torpidneſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed; for it is a general maxim that all letharget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic governments are always in danger; ſtill a certain medium ſhould be obſerved, and a particular caution not to proceed too far without being convinced a real danger does exiſt. Enquiries into the conduct of our rulers is right and reaſonable; it makes them more attentive to their duty, and good pilots will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways keep a good watch:<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for the further ſafety, to conſolidate a government, we ſhould ſtrictly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the motto that appeared at the head of Mr. Hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Every perſon in the union ſhould conſider himſelf as belonging to a great family compact, and that it is his indiſpenſible intereſt to ſupport the ſame by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a volunteer, and not a drudge, in ſupporting the cauſe of his country; but what is conceived to be of the moſt importance is the privilege of an elective government, which is, if I may be allowed the expreſſion, moſt ſhamefully neglected. A certain ſupineſs and non-attendance on elections generally prevails, as if it were rather a ſhame than an honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able duty to attend, and time will make the neglect ſtill greater. Riches beget pride, and ſome think it not an honor to mix with the multitude in elections, not conſidering that their property is as much at ſtake as that of their fellow-citizens. Churches and elections are treated much alike, except ſelf-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, ſuch as being appointed to public ſtations, &amp;c. is the moving cauſe; nay, I have known ſome cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters to ſcoff at perſons who appeared ſpirited on ſuch occaſions as I deem of the utmoſt importance. Such neglect often gives room for clamorous charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to become injurious to a government; &amp; on the contrary, when the maſs of the people move in one body, a country is ſafe. Therefore every free man of America who has a right to a vote, rich or poor, ſhould be ſtrictly careful in attending to elections, as it has long been a common remark, that when the maſs of the people collect for their ſafety, they were ſcarcely ever known to err, provided the fulfilment of the laws of their country was their motive. By appointing worthy citizens to the head of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by a conſtant and uniform attendance on elections, it will become habitual, harmonious, and of conſequence the laws of the country cheerfully adhered to<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For inſtance, when the firſt American Congreſs was choſen, the people of America were
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:027681_0237_0FD5DC1725AC8030"/>
rouſed from one end of the continent to the other, and almoſt every perſon flew to the election with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lertneſs; and where, or when, was there ever a greater and wiſer ſet of Stateſmen collected in one body together? Their reſolves and names will be recorded to their honor, to the lateſt poſterity. And does not our country at this day and at all times loudly call for wiſe and prudent ſtateſmen as leaders of the Republic.</p>
            <p>Mankind are naturally of a reſtleſs make, and a republican form of government is an aſſiſtant to their ambition, as it is natural to aſpire to poſts of honor, for which reaſon, an aſpiring man in order to render himſelf conſpicuous, will ſay—"neighbor, things does not go on right in government; our country is in danger"—and as the complaint increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, the patient, who wiſhes to be cured by obtaining ſome honorable ſtation, complains louder and louder. He rails againſt the Preſident of the United States, the Governor, and all in authority. This makes him a great man; for ſurely ſays one, and ſurely ſays another, this man muſt know a great deal, or he would not talk in this manner, not conſidering that if they obtain their ends, others are left behind to make the ſame complaints. Therefore, I ſay again, a ſtrict attention to elections will prevent much jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſcord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ſuch ambitious, reſtleſs charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Every e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector ſhould conſider himſelf a ſtateſman, and ſet too high a value on his vote to impart it to parties or tools, but conſider well who he gives his ſuffrage for, as I do pronounce every man who is inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the duties he owes his country, a very uſeleſs organ, and his ſtrings, if ſtretched, is ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:027681_0238_0FD5DC18C2975480"/>
with murmurs and complaints. But what I deem the moſt harmonious way of ſupporting a republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can government is, to act ſure. This may be thought an extraordinary remark; but what I judge the bulwark of this acting (and I am not alone) is to have a certain period of time fixed for the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in office of all public ſervants, from the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the members of the State Legiſlatures, to be elective as they are at preſent, for as many years as the law may direct, and if thought proper, after a tain period, be again replaced. Such a rule once e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerſtabliſhed, would become an eaſy cuſtom, and the perſon in office would know his deſtiny, and if he had conducted faithfully as a good ſervant, would yield up his poſt with pleaſure; and if he had not done his duty, it certainly would be proper to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place him.</p>
            <p>I before obſerved, that mankind are reſtleſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and when a dignified office is filled by one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for a long time without any limitation to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance therein, rivalings and jarrings will appear, although the officer may be ever ſo faithful; and where there is no end to the ſaid officers being held up for his old ſtation, he may be out-voted and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed from office through calumnies, which exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would not be ſo ſtrenuous, was a certain peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od ſet. Beſides a high ſtation is ever courted, and ever envied; let the perſon's conduct be ever ſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, connections and parties will naturally ariſe, and it is a ſtation or mark for the obſervation of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very individual, and the adminiſtration is attended with more or leſs complaints; therefore to relieve the perſon from ſo tottering a poſt, let another take his place, and he who has been in office can be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabled to form a better judgement of the conduct of his ſucceſſor than any other perſon; and for general
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:027681_0239_0FD5DC1C0AFAAB40"/>
tranquility a wide difference remains between a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to law, or the ſtrength of intereſt in elections that has no end to its periodical progreſſion. But it is argued, why ſhould a man be put out of office, if he has behaved well, been long experienced in government, and a good old pilot? Nay, ſome will ſay the Empire or State would be in danger, was ſuch an event to take place. I would aſk this ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple queſtion, what would become of ſuch a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was the head thereof to die? I would wiſh to pay the higheſt reſpect to every perſon who has faithfully ſerved his country, but this I am ſure of, that the lives of ſuch are as uncertain as thoſe of all other montals; and I have not ſo great an opinion of a mere man's being the ſalvation of a country which has got to be an independent nation, where the whole body moves in one common cauſe.</p>
            <p>I wiſh to be indulged with a few further remarks on our general privileges. Let us take a view of this happy land, which was firſt ſettled by Europe an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> about the year ſixteen hundred and twenty, and was under but ſmall cultivation in the year ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred. The progreſs that has ſince been made in ſo ſhort a time, is unequalled; for at this day there is no country or nation in the world that has ſo great a plenty of the neceſſaries of life as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica; the ſciences of every kind gain great per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, its laws both civil and religious, are ſuch as become an independent and enlightened nation, each religious denomination attending divine ſervice in their own way, and as Harvey ſays, like ſo many flowers, though of different colours, are all from the ſame ſoil, Theſe and many other advantages of a like kind are ſo ſtriking, that no one can doubt the aid and protection of a great governing hand. I am ſorry to obſerve that the greateſt writer of his age
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:027681_0240_0FD5DC1EC033C9D0"/>
on the free government of nations (I mean Thomas Paine,) has directed his works, ſtiled, "The Age of Reaſon," to the people of the United States of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</p>
            <p>All due deference ought to be paid to this author for his writings at an early period of the late war. "Common Senſe," "the Criſis," &amp;c. demands the gratitude of America; but his Age of Reaſon, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to the people of this country, contains a flat contradiction to the truths of the Bible, and in my opinion ought to be deemed an inſult on our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings and government—He has, ſince his reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in Europe, confeſſed that the United-States of America are a happy and free people, and that no perſon is under compulſion as to religious worſhip; but every one has a method of his own chooſing: beſides, he is ſenſible that from the firſt ſettlement of this country, no people could have been more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral in ſentiment or more ſpirited in dedicating houſes of worſhip to Almighty God in every part of this extenſive continent. The civil and religious laws have gone hand in hand ever ſince its firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, and he muſt be convinced that this country is a happy aſylum for the oppreſſed of all nations, remote from the jars, contentions and perſecutions of deſpotic powers. With theſe impreſſions on his mind it was ill done to ſtrike at the foundation of our united exiſtence; for if the bible is all fabulous, and we have no way or mode pointed out to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, our churches and church diſcipline will be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated and we become far inferior in poin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It has always been thought reaſonable for one

man when he is ſhewing another an error, that he would point out ſome way for relief; but Mr. Paine, who boaſts of being an inſtrument in liberating us from monarchial oppreſſion, has created and now damns; for in no part of his Age of Reaſon has he pointed out any method in which we may worſhip. Mr. Paine denies the bible and the Koran, or what is called the Alkoran, as equally falſe; we muſt of conſequence lay aſide both and adhere to the dictates of reaſon; and in this point every man has a right to make a propoſal, what kind of way, attitude or method is to be taken; for as I before mentioned, all nations worſhip God, and in our loſt ſituation, they are far ſuperior to us, each having their eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed modes and the tradition of their, forefathers, who <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

That there is a good and bad ſpirit, or in our primative language, God and the Devil, all hiſtorians agree,—and the intention or act of doing an unjuſt thing or committing tranſgreſſions, is ſuppoſed to be an affront to their Good Spirit. Ever ſince I have read Paine's Age of Reaſon, I have been thinking that ſhould this vaſt continent, which contains near four millions of people and is faſt increaſing, at this day, or at ſome fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture period, be all of his opinion, what a medly and jargon it would make! For if the bible is laid aſide as a piece of impoſition or falſe hiſtory, there is no command to ſerve God any way: Therefore, in the firſt place, there would be no aſſembling together to worſhip on the ſeventh, or any other day, and of conſequence all churches would be converted to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther purpoſes. Some would be for adopting ſome kind of worſhip, and others would be for no ſyſtem. However, I am of opinion a very large majority would be for having ſome regular mode of worſhip held up; and as every man would be at his option

               </gap> the building of the tower of Bable; for it muſt be underſtood that we have no tradition nor guide but the bible. Theſe things are too ſerious to trifle with, and conſidering we are happily united under a civil and religious government of our own voluntary wills, I would propoſe continuing as we are, and judge it more ſafe than to ſubmit to chance. Nay if there is no truth in the bible, we are ſafe; for God will never damn a man for his ignorance. I am fond of Mr. Paine's title page, and it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable bleſſing that we live in an age of reaſon, in which ſome doctrines that uſed to be ſtrenuouſly preached are much diſcountenanced: I mean the doctrines held by ſome Predeſtinarians which I nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er did nor never intended to believe. I recollect, when a boy, my mother ordered me to read a book that treated on predeſtination. I came to a paſſage in which the author ſaid he made no doubt but there were children in hell not more than a ſpan, or nine inches long; he did not ſay inches, but the word <hi>ſpan</hi> I ſhall ever remember. I was ſtruck with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, and have ever ſince diſpiſed ſuch ideas. I am often ſtruck with the reflection when my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are dandling and playing with all the innocence that a feeling heart can conceive, that (according to the principles of Predeſtinarians) two thirds of the dear pledges are called into exiſtence to be made miſerable through an endleſs eternity; as I cannot retain any idea of my childrens having a better chance than others, nor of their being by nature, better than thoſe born among Pagans or elsewhere. The doctrines of Predeſtination appears ſo derogato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to a Supreme Being, who created worlds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, the whole ſyſtem of which appears in ſuch
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:027681_0243_0FD5DC25047259F8"/>
harmonious order, and every thing ſo well orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in this creation for the reception of every one born into it, that it damps the ideas of his juſtice and philanthropy, and I believe has been the cauſe of many deluſions, inſanities and ſelf-murders; for inſtance, when a perſon begins to be thoughtful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a future ſtate, he immediately begins to think himſelf a choſen veſſel, which indicates that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty has reſpect to perſons. Others ſuppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deſtined for eternal wrath, and diſpairing of God's mercy frequently put an end to their lives. On the whole I muſt pronounce the perſon who holds to the doctrine, that God created from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſome to happineſs and ſome to miſery, an inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man being. Nay I ſhudder while I am writing on this ſubject. But I will quit ſo diſagreeable a theme with obſerving that it cannot be poſſible the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors of ſuch ſentiments have ever taken a view of the greatneſs and goodneſs of that being who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite in juſtice and mercy.</p>

               </gap>orthodox, particularly in America, as we wiſh to give thoſe volumes we call ſacred, their due weight, not having Popes, Inquiſitions, Friars, Biſhops and ſuch peſts of mortals, who traffic with the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel for the lucre of gain and oppreſs the people to make themſelves rich, merely through the terrors of falſe repreſentation. But on the contrary, in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, ſcientific knowledge pretty generally prevails, and we can have no better example than the travels of our bleſſed Saviour. They beſpeak every thing which is neceſſary to mortals; the whole tenor is humility towards God, and to love one another, ſeed the hungry, clothe the naked, viſit the ſick and impriſoned, and the great duty of doing as we would be done by. The whole appears to be a pattern of
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:027681_0244_0FD5DC27D797B7F8"/>
friendſhip, equal to the dignity of ſo great a perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. The ſermon on the mount, is a pledge of purity; and the whole of his ſucceſſion is a pattern of morality which cannot be copied by a mere man, as there appears in his travels one uniform ſyſtem of piety; and it is very extraordinary to me, that ſo much bigotry has ever gained ground in the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent modes of worſhip; every one thinks his own the moſt ſafe. Our Saviour's prediction of the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeruſalem, that there ſhould not of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple be left one ſtone upon another is, according to Thompſon's travels, and other hiſtorians, exactly fulfilled; and the prophecy of the deſtruction of Babylon, ſo prophetically foretold by Jeremiah, that "Babylon the great, the mighty, is fallen, and ſhall become a den for owls and pelicans, although it was once the greateſt and richeſt city in the world." Its walls was ſaid by ſome to be ſeven, and by ſome fourteen miles in circumference, fifty feet in height, and ſo wide that two chariots could drive abreaſt; having gardens erected in the air for ornament, and to diſplay its grandeur: yet no account is given where it ſtood, although ſome ſuppoſe that Grand Cairo ſtands on or near its ruins, within two miles of the river Nile, in Egypt, and is ſaid to contain two millions and an half of people. However, for my part, the buſtle and buſineſs that I am obliged to attend to, in order to obtain the neceſſaries in life for myſelf and family, will not permit my particular attention; but whoever denies the prophecies, let them read Newton on the ſubject, and they will be convinced, in my opinion, of their being wrote from inſpiration.</p>
            <p>As I have before obſerved, I never intended to be ſo much of a writer as to appear in public; but ſince I have ſo far proceeded, I deſire that nothing I
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:027681_0245_0FD5DC2951BEA9E0"/>
have advanced may be taken amiſs; for I wiſh to be honeſt, and fairly give my ſentiments. When I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun I did not expect to be ſo lengthy; but I deſpiſe apologizing, and will conclude with a recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all perſons, but particularly youth, not to be led away by this or that writer or obſerver; but act virtuouſly on this ſhort ſtage of life; for ſoon very ſoon we muſt go the way of all the earth, to give place to millions yet to be called into exiſtence. Therefore, as Doctor Young ſays, "Lean not on earth, 'twil pierce thee too the heart—a broken reed at beſt, but of't a ſpear. On its ſharp point peace bleeds, and hope expires." Adoration to God is reaſonable, and raiſes our ideas and expectations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the brutes, after paſſing through this mortal ſtate. Believe in the bible, read and endeavor to live to the rules taught by our Saviour, and when this life is done, a happy reward will enſue.</p>
