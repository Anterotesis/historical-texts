            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <hi>And I looked and roſe up, and ſaid unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the reſt of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: Remember the</hi> LORD, <hi>which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your ſons and your daughters, your wives and your houſes.</hi>

            <p>WHEN a people become voluntary ſlaves to ſin; when it is eſteemed a reproach to reverence and ſerve God; when profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſſolute morals become faſhionable; when pride and luxury predominate, we cannot expect ſuch a nation to be long happy.</p>
            <p>ISRAEL, when firſt planted in the land of Canaan, were a brave, heroic and virtuous people, being firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attached to the true worſhip of God. They were both formidable and invincible: when their armies went forth to battle, thouſands and tens of thouſands fell before them: thus being cloathed with the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:014133_0003_0F9330F24A010900"/>
of virtue and true religion, a panic ſeized the hearts of all their enemies around them. But when vice and immorality became prevalent; when they forſook and rebelled againſt their God, they loſt their martial ſpirit, and were ſoon enſlaved by the king of Babylon. Yet, as God is gracious and merciful, when ſeventy years were expired in this furnace of affliction, he remembered their low eſtate, and ſtirred up Cyrus, king of Perſia, to proclaim liberty for the Jews to return and build their temple at Jeruſalem. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs ſome of the people ſtill remained in Perſia, of which Nehemiah was one.—He was a favourite in the days of Artaxerxes the king, therefore he obtained leave to go and build the walls of that antient city Jeruſalem. But when Sanballat the Horonite, Tobiah the Ammonite, and Geſhem the Arabian heard that there were men come to ſeek the welfare of the Jews, they were filled with indignation: therefore, in ſcornful language, they bring a ſtate-accuſation againſt them, ſaying: "What is this thing that ye do? will you rebel againſt the king<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe three gentlemen were governors, and conſequently pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners. It is common for ſuch to profeſs great loyalty to kings, when in reality it is their penſion they love, and not their king. They ſpeak in court language, "Will ye rebel againſt the king?"</note>?" However, though they treated the Jews with ſcorn and inſult, yet their labour became a ſubject of converſation. Sanballat once ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the occaſion, Tobiah makes a reply to this effect, <abbr>viz.</abbr> "Tuſh, Sanballat, it is not worth your notice, nor ſhould you give yourſelf the leaſt concern about theſe feeble wretches, they build indeed, but if a fox
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:014133_0004_0F9330F3110331B0"/>
in his meanders was to aſcend their ſtone wall, and only give a few ſcratches, it would fall down." Theſe ſcornful inſults were ſpoken that the Jews might hear them, and be diſcouraged; but when they ſaw that the work went on with rapidity, they were filled with the higheſt indignation, and reſolved, if bitter taunts, theſe ſwords of their mouths, would not diſcourage them, their ſwords of ſteel ſhould compel them to ceaſe from their work: therefore Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabians, the Ammonites and Aſhdodites all conſpire together, to come with their united force againſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem. Their deſign was made known to Nehemiah; and, as all ſhould do, eſpecially in diſtreſs, he lifts up his eyes to heaven, and makes his ſupplication to the LORD of hoſt; nor does he think his preſervation ſhall be effected in neglect of the uſe of means; therefore he ſets a watch againſt them day and night, and addreſſes himſelf to all ranks of people in theſe ſpirited and excellent words, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>Be not ye afraid of them: Remember the</hi> LORD, <hi>which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your ſons and your daughters, your wives and your houſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the words obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A caution againſt cowardice, or fear of an enemy unjuſtly enraged. <hi>Be not ye afraid of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is of great importance in war to be delivered from fear of the enemy; for ſoldiers in a panic gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally fall a victim in the diſpute.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:014133_0005_0F9330F3D31C5198"/>
2. We have an argument to excite fortitude and firmneſs of mind in martial engagements. <hi>Remember the</hi> LORD, <hi>which is great and terrible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A fervent call to preſent duty in times of diſtreſs. <hi>And fight for your brethren, your ſons, your daughters, your wives and your houſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To improve the words ſuitable to the occaſion of the preſent ſolemnity, the following order ſhall be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted,</p>
            <p>I. An endeavour ſhall be made to prove, that in ſome caſes, when a people are oppreſſed, inſulted and abuſed, and can have no other redreſs, it then becomes our duty as men, with our eyes to GOD, to fight for our liberties and properties; or in other words, that a defenſive war is ſinleſs before GOD, conſequently to engage therein, is conſiſtent with the pureſt religion. Here ſome texts in the New Teſtament, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſome good men from engaging in the preſent diſpute, ſhall be conſidered.</p>
            <p>II. Some particulars ſhall be preſented to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, to demonſtrate the alarming call, which we now have to take up arms in our own defence.</p>
            <p>III. A few arguments ſhall be advanced to excite fortitude in martial engagements.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, Some inferences ſhall be drawn.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:014133_0006_0F9330F489E67068"/>
The ſubject before us is of great importance.—It is to be lamented that we have the preſent occaſion to conſider it.—It is very copious, and as it is new to me, brevity and great accuracy can ſcarcely be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. If GOD ſhall enable us to conſider each pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition conſiſtent with his honour, and worthy of his majeſty, we may reſt ſatisfied. Your attention, my Brethren and Countrymen is begged, while an endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is made,</p>
            <p>I. To prove, that in ſome caſes, when a people are oppreſſed, inſulted and abuſed, and can have no other redreſs, it then becomes our duty as men, with our eyes to GOD, to fight for our liberties and properties; or in other words, that <hi>a defenſive war is ſinleſs before</hi> GOD; conſequently to engage therein, is conſiſtent with the pureſt religion.</p>
            <p>If antiquity, if the united voice of all kingdoms, that now or ever have exiſted, could be admitted as a proof, the point would eaſily be determined; for there has been no kingdom, whether compoſed of Jews or Gentiles, Barbarians or Chriſtians, but have embraced it as their common creed, that a defenſive war is inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent. But though this is a preſumptive argument, yet it muſt be confeſſed, that it is not a deciſive proof: for antient miſtakes are miſtakes, and a multitude may be wrong.</p>
            <p>But if this propoſition can be made appear from the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014133_0007_0F9330F54C8B7CA0"/>
holy ſcriptures, as we profeſs them to be our only rule of faith and practice, then it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that a defenſive war is ſinleſs, and conſiſtent with the pureſt religion. To them let us repair with attentive ears, to hear what the lively oracles of GOD will ſay on this point.</p>
            <p>Among all the antient ſervants of GOD none is more famous for true piety and pure religion than the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch Abraham—to him the higheſt epithets are given—he is more than once called the friend of GOD—in his ſteps the righteous are to walk—to him were many great and precious promiſes made, and yet we find this great, this holy man firmly of the faith that a defenſive war is ſinleſs. He makes a bright diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of his faith, when the four kings took Lot, his brother's ſon, captive. Doth his religion prevent his purſuit of the enemy? No, verily. With a heart de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the moſt high GOD, he collects his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and ſome confederates; with martial weapons in his hands, he purſues the foes, and utterly diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits the four kings, and triumphantly brings back the captives, with all the ſpoil. This was the very time that Melchizedeck, the prieſt of the moſt high GOD, met him. And did he reprove or curſe him? No, ſays the text, "he brought forth bread and wine,"—giving him the higheſt expreſſions of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, he thus addreſſed him, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <q>Bleſſed be Abraham of the moſt high GOD, poſſeſſor of heaven and earth, and bleſſed be the moſt high GOD, which
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014133_0008_0F9330F609AC9000"/>
hath delivered thine enemies into thine hand.</q> 
               <hi>Gen.</hi> xiv: 18. 19. 20. This paſſage proves not only that this was Abram's belief, but alſo that Melchizedek, prieſt of the moſt high GOD, Melchizedek, the brighteſt type of CHRIST, was fully of the ſame opinion, and therefore may be admitted as an evidence in favour of a defenſive war. For any of us to preſume that we have a better conſcience than Melchizedeck, would argue either pride or ignorance.</p>
            <p>If we trace the ſacred hiſtory, and deſcend to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages, we ſhall find that Moſes is of the ſame faith. Among all the children of men none was more meek, and admitted to greater familiarity with GOD, than Moſes. He is often called, by way of eminence, "Moſes, the ſervant of GOD." By his hands we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the lively oracles of GOD, and the apoſtle bears him witneſs, that "he was faithful in all things;" yet we find him often engaged in bloody battles. One inſtance may ſuffice at preſent, out of many that might be produced, and that is, when, on the moſt reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able terms, he requeſts to paſs through the land of Sihon, king of the Amorites, pledging his honour that no damage ſhould be done; <hi>Num.</hi> xxi: 22. but Sihon, inſtead of granting the ſmall privilege of paſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along the highway, advances with all his armies againſt Iſrael. Doth Moſes think it his duty to make no defence? Let us view his conduct. Iſrael advances with ſword in hand, and utterly diſcomfits the Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites.—If we read the book of Joſhuah, his immediate
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014133_0009_0F9330F6C9C06A08"/>
ſucceſſor, we ſhall find him of the ſame mind. Iſrael are called the peculiar people of GOD, to whom his mind was revealed, and this is the faith of the whole houſe of Iſrael.—If it was a ſin to engage in a defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive war, can we ſuppoſe that Iſrael ſhould be ignorant of it? Seeing therefore that it is ſinleſs, it is meet that we ſhould tread in the footſteps of this flock, which is gone before us.—And were we further to attend to the ſacred hiſtory, we ſhall find, that after the death of Joſhuah and the elders, which ſaw the mighty works of GOD, that Iſrael firſt being enſlaved by ſin, were oppreſſed by various nations; but when they cried unto the LORD, he raiſed up deliverers, among whom were Othniel, Ehud, Barak, Gideon, Jephtha, and many others, which performed glorious exploits, and were bleſſed inſtruments under GOD to deliver Iſrael from oppreſſion and bondage. Some of theſe, you know, are ſpoken of as the worthies of Iſrael and have much recorded in their praiſe; and yet all theſe died in the faith, that a defenſive war is ſinleſs before GOD. Still were we to deſcend and purſue the chain of hiſtory, we ſhall find all the kings of Iſrael of the ſame faith. Among many that might be mentioned, we ſhall at preſent take notice only of one. David, a man eminent for pure religion, the ſweet pſalmiſt of Iſrael, David, a man after GOD'S own heart, yet all his life is a ſcene of war. When he was even a youth, he began his martial exploits, and delivered Iſrael by ſlaying great Goliath of Gath, the champion of the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014133_0010_0F9330F78C1523C0"/>
Philiſtines. And what ſhall I ſay more? The time would fail me to enumerate all who were avouchers of this propoſition: It is therefore a clear point, that a defenſive war is ſinleſs, and conſiſtent with the pureſt religion.</p>
            <p>This indeed is generally acknowledged, when our diſpute is with a foreign enemy, but at preſent it ſeems like a houſe divided againſt itſelf; our diſpute is with adminiſtration. This is cauſe of great ſorrow, that ſuch a heavy judgment has befallen the kingdom; and yet we are not without ſome inſtances in ſcripture of people refuſing obedience to kings, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came arbitrary and oppreſſive. When Rehoboam threatened Iſrael with nothing but tyranny, they did not long heſitate till they gave the king this anſwer, <q>What portion have we in David? Neither have we inheritance in the ſon of Jeſſe: To your tents, oh Iſrael! Now ſee to thine own houſe David.</q> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> xii: 16.</p>
            <p>And this certainly has been the faith of Great-Britain, as might be made appear by many inſtances, one of which I ſhall at preſent juſt mention. When king James II. departed from the conſtitution, and became arbitrary, by diſpenſing with acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by proclamation, iſſuing <hi>quo warrantos</hi> againſt charters, and endeavouring to introduce popery, the people eſteemed it no ſin to invite William, the prince of Orange, to invade England, and obliged James to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014133_0011_0F9330F86BF12158"/>
abdicate a kingdom he had forfeited his right to govern.</p>
            <p>But there are ſome texts of ſcripture urged on this occaſion, which were to be conſidered. The following are thought to enjoin non-reſiſtance in the ſtrongeſt terms, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers: For there is no power but of</hi> GOD; <hi>the powers that be, are ordained of</hi> GOD. <hi>Whoſoever therefore reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of</hi> GOD: <hi>and they that reſiſt, ſhall receive to themſelves condemnation.</hi> Rom. xiii: 1. 2, &amp;c. The apoſtle is no friend to anarchy, for he well knew the corruption and depravity of man would oppreſs the innocent, if there were no legal reſtraints. But, in order rightly to underſtand theſe words, it is of great importance to determine firſt, what is meant by the <hi>higher powers:</hi> For this is what every ſoul is to be ſubject unto. We ſhall find no expoſition liable to leſs exception, than to underſtand by the higher powers the juſt, the good, the wholeſome and conſtitutional laws of a land, merely reſpecting civil government. The very deſign of theſe higher powers is to ſecure the property and promote the happineſs of the whole community.—Theſe higher powers therefore appear as binding on princes as people. And as GOD has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained theſe powers for the good of the whole, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever reſiſteth the ſame, reſiſteth the ordinance of GOD, and receiveth finally condemnation, and that juſtly; for anarchy and tyranny are eſſentially the ſame, and equally to be dreaded, as each reſiſts the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014133_0012_0F9330F92A312D90"/>
higher powers. We cannot ſuppoſe, either that this text enjoins abſolute ſubmiſſion to all laws, which may be made in a land; for ſome are ſo wicked, oppreſſive and unjuſt in their nature and tendency, that the beſt of men have thought it their indiſpenſable duty to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obey them. You may well remember, that Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar made it a certain law, that all nations in his empire ſhould, on pain of death, worſhip his golden image. Was it the duty of his ſubject to obey or not? The conduct of Shadrach, Meſhach and Abednego will determine the point, who, refuſing to comply, were caſt into a fiery furnace. Remember alſo, when Darius, king of Perſia, made a ſtatute, that no man ſhould petition either GOD or man, ſave himſelf, for thirty days, Daniel refuſed obedience unto the decree, becauſe it was unrighteous. Call to mind alſo, that in the days of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, he enjoined it as a law to all the midwives, that they ſhould kill all the male-children of the Jews. Did they obey or not? The text informs us that the fear of GOD prevented them, believing that no law can make that juſt, which in its own nature is unrighteous. The higher powers, of which Paul ſpeaks, are ordained of GOD, and if or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of him, they muſt be like unto him, who is a GOD of unſpotted juſtice and truth. Certain it is, that the people muſt be the judges whether the laws are good or not;—and I think it muſt be acknowledged by all, that laws are not good, except they ſecure every man's liberty and property, and defend the ſubject
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014133_0013_0F9330F9CF9D40E0"/>
againſt the arbitrary power of kings, or any body of men whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Again, another text, uſed to enforce the doctrine of non-reſiſtance in the preſent diſpute, is, <hi>Submit your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to every ordinance of man, for the</hi> LORD'S <hi>ſake, whether unto the king as ſupreme, or unto governors as unto them that are ſent by him, for the puniſhment of evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well.</hi> 1 Pet. ii: 13. 14. This text is to be underſtood in a reſtricted and limited ſenſe as above. We cannot ſuppoſe, that the apoſtle meant obedience to all deſpotic ordinances of tyrants; for this would condemn the conduct of the midwives, Daniel, Shadrach, Meſhach and Abednego. The ordinances here can be none other than ſuch as are good, and ordained of GOD, for whoſe ſake we are to ſubmit unto them; for theſe higher powers, or ordinances, are the proviſion of GOD, which he has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for the Safety of the people, to defend them againſt oppreſſion and arbitrary power. There is none, but GOD, ſuitably qualified to rule according to his own will and pleaſure, ſo that when man aſſumes to rule arbitrarily, he ſets himſelf in the temple of GOD, ſhewing himſelf that he is God; for none is qualified for that ſeat, but him that is infinitly wiſe, juſt and holy. We ſee, when theſe words are taken in a limited ſenſe, there is no evil conſequence follows, but if we underſtand them to bind us to obey all that taſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters require, then it is plain that we condemn king Henry VIII. for refuſing obedience to the pope of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014133_0014_0F9330FB03218768"/>
Rome. Many <hi>bulls</hi> were thundered out againſt him, but he and the parliament reſolved that they were a complete legiſlative body in themſelves, paying no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the threats of Rome. If we were to embrace any other expoſition of theſe paſſages of ſcripture, we ſhould abſolutely condemn the Reformation; nay, we would condemn all England, who refuſed obedience to king James II. becauſe he would not be ſubject to the higher powers, but endeavoured to ſubvert the conſtitution, and to reign arbitrarily. Such a ſentiment, if purſued, would lead back to all the horrors of popery and deſpotiſm; nay, it would even condemn the bleſſed martyrs, who refuſed obedience to arbitrary and wicked laws.</p>
            <p>Some will object, that theſe laws reſpected religion, which makes an eſſential difference; for when religion is affected, one may withſtand a kingdom. Calvin and Luther were of this faith. It is granted, that there is great difference between ſtate affairs and religion; for Chriſt ſays, "his kingdom is not of this world;" none dare impoſe laws in matters of religion on his ſubjects, without being guilty of a daring inſult: but the inſtances above do not all reſpect religion, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are ſuitable on the preſent occaſion; and thoſe that do reſpect religion, were brought to prove that the words are to be taken in a reſtricted ſenſe. I have met with none, but acknowledge theſe texts muſt be ſo underſtood, as to juſtify oppoſition to popiſh ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. And pray, my countrymen, what better is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014133_0015_0F9330FB5646E568"/>
tyranny than popiſh? Is there any eſſential dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between being robbed by a <hi>proteſtant</hi> or a papiſt? Is it not the very ſame thing? Tyranny is tyranny, ſlavery is ſlavery, by whomſoever it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. Names change not the nature of things. If deſpotiſm is bad in a papiſt, it cannot be good in a <hi>proteſtant.</hi> If it may be reſiſted in one, it ought to be in the other.</p>
            <p>But to proceed: There is another objection, which good people make againſt war of any kind, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <q>That war is not agreeable to the diſpoſition of ſouls newly converted to the knowledge of CHRIST: Then we long for the ſalvation of ſouls, and have a tender regard for all men: Surely martial en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements do not ſuit a meek and loving diſciple of JESUS.</q> I confeſs, no objection to me is of equal importance to this. It is a ſolemn conſideration:—Alas! alas! that ever there was occaſion of even a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive war: but occaſion there has been, and occaſion there now is.—The reaſon why a defenſive war ſeems ſo awful to good people, is, they eſteem it to be ſome kind of murder: but this is a very great miſtake; for it is no more murder than a legal proceſs againſt a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal. The end is the ſame, the mode is different. In ſome caſes it is the only mode leſt to obtain juſtice. And ſurely that religion is not from heaven, which is againſt juſtice on earth. Remember all men are not converted; if they were, there could be no neceſſity of war in any ſenſe. For, ſays the ſcripture, <q>they ſhall
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014133_0016_0F9330FC0AD17478"/>
not hurt nor deſtroy.</q> But remember, this is when the earth ſhall be filled with the knowledge of the LORD. Alas! this is not the caſe now; for darkneſs, gloomy darkneſs, prevails throughout the kingdoms of this world. Oh! that the kingdom of JESUS was come, when we ſhould have occaſion to learn war no more. But to give a more particular anſwer to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, conſider that the deſign of laws is to puniſh evil-doers,—to bring to juſtice offenders, and to ſecure the innocent in the peaceable poſſeſſion of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties: for this end GOD has ordained theſe higher powers; but it ſome times has been the caſe, that thoſe, in whoſe hands theſe powers are entruſted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come tyrannical, and the greateſt offenders, and ſhall they live with impunity? GOD forbid! how ſhall juſtice be obtained? every mode is evaded. The caſe is ſimilar with a foreign enemy, we cannot have redreſs any other way, no other method is left to obtain juſtice; and though the mode is different, the iſſue is the ſame as when we execute a criminal condemned by a jury. Suppoſe, a villain was to rob you of a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable ſum of money, and thereby expoſe you and your family to diſtreſs and poverty, would you not think it your duty to proſecute ſuch a public offender? yes, without doubt, or elſe you could not be a friend to the innocent part of mankind. But ſuppoſe, he not only robs you, but in a daring manner, in your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, murders your only ſon, will you not think that blood calls aloud for puniſhment? Surely both reaſon and revelation will juſtify you in ſeeking for juſtice in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014133_0017_0F9330FD0A41B798"/>
that mode by which it can be obtained. The preſent caſe is only too ſimilar:—by an arbitrary act all the families that depended on the Newfoundland fiſhery are abandoned to diſtreſs and poverty, and the blood of numbers ſpilt already without a cauſe. Surely it is conſiſtent with the pureſt religion to ſeek for juſtice. Conſider the caſe in this point of view, and he that is not clear in conſcience to gird on his ſword, if he would act conſiſtently, muſt never ſit on a jury to condemn a criminal.</p>
            <p>II. This brings me to the ſecond thing propoſed, which was to preſent a few particulars to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, which will demonſtrate the alarming call, which we now have, to take up arms, and fight in our own defence.—</p>
            <p>We have no choice left to us, but to ſubmit to abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſlavery and deſpotiſm, or as free-men to ſtand in our own defence, and endeavour a noble reſiſtance. Matters are at laſt brought to this deplorable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity;—every reaſonable method of reconciliation has been tried in vain;—our addreſſes to our king have been treated with neglect or contempt. It is true that a plan of accommodation has been propoſed by adminiſtration; but they are men of more ſenſe than to think it could be accepted. It could be propoſed for no other purpoſe than to deceive England into an opinion, that we did not deſire reconciliation. What was the ſubſtance of this pretended plan? In ſhort
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:014133_0018_0F9330FDA2632190"/>
this, that we ſhould give them as much money as they were pleaſed to aſk, and we might raiſe it in our own mode.—Slaves therefore we muſt be, only we ſhall be indulged to put on our fetters, to ſuit ourſelves.—This plan is no better than that clauſe, which ſays, <q>That the parliament have a right to make laws to bind us in all caſes whatſoever.</q> For if they may fix the ſum, and we muſt raiſe it, the caſe is the ſame, we have nothing left, but what they have no uſe for;—all is at their diſpoſal, and we ſhall have no voice in the application of our own money. They may apply it to raiſe forces in Canada, to cut our throats. The call therefore is alarming—we cannot ſubmit to be ſlaves—we were born free, and we can die free. Only attend to the voice of parliament, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <q>That they have a right to make laws to bind us in all caſes whatſoever.</q>—Even our religion is not excepted—they aſſume a right to bind us in all caſes.—Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this propoſition, they may oblige us to ſupport popiſh prieſts, on pain of death:—they have already given us a ſpecimen of the good effects of their aſſumed power, in eſtabliſhing popery in near one half of North-America. Is not this the loudeſt call to arms? All is at ſtake—we can appeal to GOD, that we believe our cauſe is juſt and good. But to attend to our text, "and fight "for your brethren," our brethren in the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts are already declared <hi>rebels;</hi>—they are treated as ſuch, and we as abettors are involved in the ſame cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances;—nothing can be more unjuſt than ſuch a proclamation. Rebels are men diſaffected with their
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014133_0019_0F9330FE471892F8"/>
ſovereign in favour of ſome other perſon. This is not the caſe of America; for if Jacobites were not more common in England than with us, we ſhould not have had occaſion of the preſent diſpute. We very well know what follows this proclamation, all our eſtates are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated, and were we even to ſubmit, we ſhould be hanged as dogs.—Now therefore let us join, and fight for our brethren. Remember our Congreſs is in emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger. It is compoſed of men of equal characters and fortunes of moſt, if not ſuperior to any in North-America.—Theſe worthy gentlemen have ventured all in the cauſe of liberty for our ſakes;—if we were to forſake them, they muſt be abandoned to the rage of a relentleſs miniſtry. Some of them are already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, and no doubt this would be the fate of the reſt:—How could we bear to ſee theſe worthy patriots hanged as criminals of the deepeſt dye? their families plundered of all that they poſſeſs, and abandoned to diſtreſs and poverty? This, my countrymen, muſt be the caſe, if you will not now as men fight for your brethren: Therefore if we do not ſtand by them, even unto death, we ſhould be guilty of the baſeſt ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and entail on ourſelves everlaſting infamy. But if the caſe of our brethren is not ſo near as ſuitably to affect us, let us conſider the condition of our ſons and daughters. Your ſons are engaged in the preſent diſpute, and therefore ſubject to all the conſequences: Oh! remember if you ſubmit to arbitrary meaſures, you will entail on your ſons deſpotic power. Your ſons and your daughters muſt be ſtrangers to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:014133_0020_0F9330FF10290238"/>
of liberty;—they will be conſidered like beaſts of burden, only made for their <hi>maſters uſe.</hi> If the groans and cries of poſterity in oppreſſion can be any argument, come now, my noble countrymen, fight for your ſons and your daughters. But if this will not alarm you, conſider what will be the caſe of your wives, if a noble reſiſtance is not made: all your eſtates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated, and diſtributed to the favourites of arbitrary power, your wives muſt be left to diſtreſs and poverty. This might be the better endured, only the moſt worthy and flower of all the land ſhall be hanged, and widowhood and poverty both come in one day. The call to arms is therefore alarming, eſpecially when we conſider the tender mercies of the wicked are cruel, we can expect no favour from adminiſtration. They ſeem to be callous, ſo as to have no feeling of human diſtreſs. What can be a greater demonſtration than to excite the barbarous ſavages againſt us?<note n="*" place="bottom">It is beyond diſpute, that Guy Johnſon is uſing his influence with the Mohawks againſt us, as well as the Superintendant of South-Carolina. Theſe muſt be bribed by Adminiſtration, whoſe tools and penſioners they are.</note> Theſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of coming againſt our armed men, will beſet our defenceleſs frontiers, and barbarouſly murder with ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage cruelty poor helpleſs women and children. Oh, did ever mortal hear of ſuch inhuman barbarity!<note n="†" place="bottom">It is a received maxim, that he that employs an aſſaſſin is as bad as himſelf.</note> Come then, my countrymen, we have no other remedy, but, under GOD, to fight for our brethren, our ſons and our daughters, our wives and our houſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:014133_0021_0F9330FFCE3DCC38"/>
III. It is probable that the moſt will acknowledge, that the call to arms is alarming, but we are compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively weak to Great Britain; an anſwer to this will bring us to the third thing under conſideration, which was, to advance a few arguments to excite fortitude in martial engagements And no argument is greater than our text, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <q>Remember the LORD is great and terrible.</q> All human aid is ſubject to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, but when our dependance is on the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty GOD, we may hope for ſucceſs, for the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to ſhew himſelf ſtrong in behalf of them whoſe heart is perfect towards him. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xvi: 9. He gives us a glorious diſplay of his aſſiſtance in the caſe of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, who lifted up his hand to the moſt high GOD, and purſued the four kings with their numerous ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and GOD delivered them into his hand, for he is great, and doth great and marvellous things in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of them that truſt in him. Remember what the LORD has done in ages paſt: Iſrael were in the days of Saul ſorely beſet by the Philiſtines,—their hearts trembled at the formidable aſpect of great Goliath of Gath; but GOD ſends forth a youth, even a ſtripling, againſt this man of war, and ſoon we ſee the inſulting foe lie proſtrate at the feet of David. Call to mind what he did to the Aſſyrian hoſt in the days of Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah: with bitter taunts Rabſhakeh reproaches Iſrael, threatening, that if they did not ſoon ſurrender, that he would oblige them to eat their own excrements and drink their own urine.—But behold the hand of the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014133_0022_0F93310088B537B0"/>
LORD is with Iſrael, therefore an angel of death is ſent, who ſmote the Aſſyrian camp, ſo that an hundred four ſcore and five thouſand were dead corps in the morning light. Kings and captains may boaſt great things, but GOD alone is truly great, and greatly to be feared; he doth his pleaſure in the heavens above, and among the inhabitants of the earth, and all nations are as nothing in his ſight. GOD is not only great, but terrible in his judgments; an inſtance we have in Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who was reſolved to keep Iſrael in bondage, but was fatally diſappointed in the red ſea. His judgments are both great and various; how eaſy is it for GOD to baffle all the counſels of our enemies? how eaſily can he divide them, or raiſe up enemies that ſhall give them employment enough at home? So he delivered David in the wilderneſs of Maon. Our GOD is able to give us pity in the eyes of the nations around us, ſo that they will afford their aid, if required. If GOD be for us, who can be againſt us? We have great reaſon to bewail the ſins of the land, yet the LORD has a people in it reſerved for himſelf, and if this had been the caſe with Sodom, it would have been ſaved.—Our preſent diſpute is juſt, our cauſe is good.—We have been as loyal ſubjects as any on earth;—at all times, when occaſion called, we have contributed towards the expence of war, with liberal hands, beyond our power, even in their eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When we have been called to venture our lives in defence of our king and country, have we refuſed? No, verily; we have been willing to ſpill our precious
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:014133_0023_0F933101634ED180"/>
blood. We have been charged with deſigns of inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency: This poſſibly may be the event, but ſurely againſt our wills; the decent addreſſes to his Majeſty, as well as all other prudential meaſures, are arguments in our favour. But all our meaſures are diſregarded, the terms offered us are but a few degrees milder than what the Ammonites offered to Jabeſh-Gilead. Theſe poor men offered more than reaſon could aſk, but nothing would ſerve, only for each to have his right eye put out—the terms were bad—tears flowed from every eye—wailings reached the ears of Saul, and the ſpirit of the LORD came on him. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xi: 6. By the ſpirit of GOD here we may underſtand a martial ſpirit ſtirred up in Saul. He aſſembles all Iſrael, and makes a noble reſiſtance, attended with a glorious victory over the enemy.—The ſpirit of GOD coming on him was a preſage of ſucceſs. And has not the ſame ſpirit come on us? A martial ſpirit from GOD has ſpread through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the land. Surely, if this is not a heavy judgment, it is a preſage of ſucceſs. We are fully perſuaded, that this ſpirit is not a judgment, becauſe our cauſe is good, even in the ſight of other States. To the Moſt High we can appeal, and ſubmit the event to his pleaſure. It is more than probable that we may meet with ſome defeats, and have much blood ſhed; but even if this ſhould be the caſe, let us not be diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged; for ſo it was with Iſrael in their firſt battles with Benjamin, but in the third battle the whole tribe of Benjamin is cut off, ſave ſix hundred men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:014133_0024_0F93310206859DE0"/>
There is only one conſideration that is very diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging, and that is the great and many ſins that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in our land. <q>Unfeignedly to confeſs and deplore our many ſins,</q> is recommended by our Congreſs as one duty of this day. And, alas! we have many great ſins abounding in our land, for which we may juſtly bewail our caſe before GOD, ſome of which, it may not be amiſs to mention here: but where ſhall I begin? There is one heaven daring and God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking ſin, which prevails even among many who otherwiſe are gentlemen, that is profaneneſs of language, in taking the tremendous name of GOD in vain. This is a ſin of the firſt magnitude—men have the leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe for it—no ſenſe is gratified—it is attended with no profit—yet how common is it in almoſt every town and province! Remember that it is him, who is great and terrible, that ſays, he will not hold him guiltleſs that taketh his name in vain. Add to this, the diſſolute debauchery, drunkenneſs, pride and exceſs which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails in our land, and we ſhall not wonder that the LORD has a controverſy with the kingdom. Theſe and many other ſins we have reaſon to bewail before GOD, and are the only diſcouragements in the preſent diſpute. And if we are ſucceſsful in our preſent ſtruggle for liberty, we cannot expect to enjoy any laſting happineſs without a reformation, and a life worthy of the glorious goſpel.—Was the fear of GOD ſuitably in our hearts, we ſhould be invincible; for if GOD be for us, who can be againſt us? But, alas! there ſeems but little concern about forſaking ſin and
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:014133_0025_0F933102CB4FEB78"/>
a ſaving acquaintance with GOD, though our preſent ſtate is ſo alarming: All the horrors of a war is at hand—death is ready to triumph over his thouſands, and are we ſtill aſleep in ſin?—We are called to fight for our brethren, our ſons and our daughters, our wives and our houſes; and if GOD forſakes us, our ſlavery is ſure.—Many truſt too much on the arm of fleſh; but let us place all our confidence in GOD, and uſe every prudential ſtep. Nehemiah prays, but omits not the uſe of means, he ſets a watch night and day to guard againſt the enemy, and every man is equipped for battle.</p>
            <p>Thus, my hearers, I have conſidered every point which demanded our preſent attention. I hope that it has been made evident, that a defenſive war is ſinleſs, and conſiſtent with the pureſt religion. This I can ſay, theſe arguments have removed all difficulties from my own breaſt. Seeing therefore, that it is ſinleſs, and we are called to take the bloody weapons of death in hand, let not the expence of war diſcourage us. This indeed muſt be very great, but be it ſo; we fight not for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent profit, no, our noble ſtruggle is for liberty itſelf, without which even life would be miſerable—what though the half, nay the three parts, of our eſtates be loſt, we ſhall have the fourth remaining;—our land is good, we can live. Providence can eaſily compenſate our loſs. And remember the LORD is great, matters may have a ſpeedy iſſue; he can raiſe the ſpirit of the inhabitants of Great-Britain in our favour;—their
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:014133_0026_0F93310395AA66E8"/>
voice ſhall reach the throne;—he is able to open the eyes of adminiſtration, or remove our enemies from about his Majeſty, ſo that there may yet be a happy reconciliation with Great-Britain. We have conſidered the alarming call, which we have to take up arms;—let us unite as men poſſeſſed of a true ſenſe of liberty. If any are not clear in conſcience, let us not deſpiſe them I confeſs ſome are provoking, but mildneſs is our duty; that with well-doing we may ſilence the obſtinacy of evil men.—On the whole, we are come to the unhappy ſtate of a civil war, and I remember Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop Burnet makes a remark to this effect, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <q>Of all calamities it is the greateſt, for though we know where it begins, we know not where it ſhall end.</q>—If ever there was one time that called for more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion than another, this is the very time. And yet, alas! alas! how few are ſeeking GOD! how few are ſeeking their ſalvation, when death is even at the door, and all at ſtake! Let me therefore entreat you ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to lay to heart the preſent ſtate, and <q>remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the LORD, which is great and terrible.</q> 
               <hi>Amen.</hi>
