            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>AS far as it is conſiſtent with improving the morals, and inſtructive to mankind, the ſupport of religion and moral duties;— the <hi>glory of our Maker,</hi> and ſalvation of ſouls; it is an incumbent duty upon every member of the community to lend his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, towards accompliſhing that ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary purpoſe proportionable to the abilities with which he is poſſeſſed. How far the Author's endeavours merits this title, an impartial and judicious reader will eaſily determine, and no farther does he requeſt the patronage of public favour.</p>

            <p>He cannot but hope that an inſtitution founded upon principles of ſo benevolent a motive, will be crowned with that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs as is conſiſtent with the many unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen advantages, and benefits that may reaſonably be expected to accrue from it, to Emigrants of all deſcriptions; either to thoſe whoſe immediate neceſſities may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire preſent aſſiſtance, or ſuch whoſe affluent circumſtances may only require the needful information to accommodate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with convenience and happineſs.</p>

            <head>THE DESIGN.</head>
            <p>THE Author has, in this treatiſe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to repreſent CAIN under the weight of thoſe awful impreſſions that violent murder generally makes upon the mind of the perpetrator, and the remorſe of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence that accompanies guilt of ſo horrid a nature; at the ſame time, to inculcate the neceſſity of humiliation and penitence, with a patient ſubmiſſion to the will of an offended GOD. Though the infliction of his chaſtiſements may be attended with ſevere croſſes and tribulations for reſtleſs and uncomfortable ſeaſons; yet ſtill his diſpenſations are all appointed for our good in the end. Although the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our body or mind, inflicted upon us for our iniquities, may ſeem for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent grievous, we muſt not miſtruſt his clemency and mercy, for his ways of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation far exceeds our finite comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Theſe conſiderations are encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements to the vileſt ſinner, not to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, nor for the moſt upright man to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume;
<pb facs="unknown:030283_0008_0FE5A1520826F5B8"/>for although, while we are in the body there is <hi>hope,</hi> ſo on the other hand, to counterbalance that hope, there are <hi>temptations.</hi> The <hi>Almighty</hi> can, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently does make uſe of ſupernatural means to convince us of his <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> and wean our affections from tranſitory and periſhable delights; and though thoſe alarming <hi>mementos,</hi> may convey terrific ideas to our imaginations, yet ſtill his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes are founded upon unerring wiſdom; and calculated for our good; and while we reſtrain all our <hi>inordinate</hi> deſires, he will bountifully ſupply all our <hi>neceſſary</hi> wants, as far as conſiſtent with his own <hi>glory,</hi> and our good.</p>
            <p>Thus the Author has endeavoured to render <hi>Cain's Lamentations over Abel,</hi> as uſeful to mankind, as <hi>Geſſner</hi> did the <hi>Death of Abel.</hi>

If ſo, why not the elder before the younger ſon of ADAM? Why either of the two before the father of both? Aſtoniſhment ſeizes me! my ſoul is troubled! I dread the conſequences of my deed!

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030283_0013_0FE5A19055778390"/>he haſtens towards ADAM, and thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes him: 'Father, thou firſt and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of men, ſpeak to thy firſt born; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain not an anſwer to the requeſts of CAIN thy ſon; reject not his ſolicitations, nor turn a deaf ear to his petition—remove the ſorrows of his ſoul, or they will become an increaſing evil with his length of days— Declare unto him the mutation that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven has ordained for mankind—enlighten his ignorance; and let him not continue in the obſcurity of fear, and hourly wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the labyrinth of deſpairing doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.' ADAM ſpeaks—'Child open thy mind to thy father.' CAIN begins—</p>
            <p>'Make known the will of GOD to thy ſon, that future generations may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the decrees of Heaven— Will the Creator of the world condeſcend to appear to the deſcendants of ADAM, and with the voice of majeſty admoniſh them for their future obedience, to cleave to good and abhor evil? Are theſe any of the conditions the Almighty entered into
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030283_0014_0FE5A15A113FB5E0"/>with ADAM, as renewing covenants for children yet unborn? Will CAIN, will ABEL, have the gracious opportunity of hearing and anſwering the Eternal One, by declaring his will to regulate their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conduct in life? Will new commands, and injunctions of obedience be delivered to them, to guide them in the paths of rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and truth? Speak, my father, while CAIN thy ſon is cloſe attention, to procure alleviation to his wounded ſoul.' ADAM thus begins;</p>
            <p>'What alleth my firſt-born? What tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous grief has taken poſſeſſion of the ſoul of my eldeſt child? thoſe queſtions border upon phrenzy; ſuch interrogatories cannot proceed from deliberation, ripened by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect maturity; Thy father is at a loſs—it exceeds the limits of his comprehenſion, even to conceive the ſprings from whence thy difficult paſſages ſlow; it muſt be the production of ſome ſudden diſaſter in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for thy ſoul to be ſo agitated; origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating in the firſt great ſin of diſobedience
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030283_0015_0FE5A191E4DDA328"/>in thy father; and thoſe diſquietudes and diſtracted emotions that diſorganiſe the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal parts of my ſon, muſt be the fruits of that firſt guilt.'</p>
            <p>'Oh, ADAM! thy memory is now refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the bitter reflections of that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded moment, when the firſt act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude and evil was committed upon the earth by taſting the forbidden fruit.'</p>
            <p>'Nothing, my child, has been withheld from thee or thy brother, that was apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to your neceſſary knowledge, that has been manifeſted unto ADAM your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by the Great Creator; no duties commanded or reſtrictions enjoined, have been kept from you; for it contributes much to the happineſs of my days to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the holy and blameleſs walking of my children before the Lord in purity of heart and uprightneſs of life; ſtrictly adhering to the commandments of heaven, and in mutual love and concord with each other. But, CAIN, thy diſordered looks forbode
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:030283_0016_0FE5A15C1D5F4598"/>ſome trouble pending, and nearly ripe to fruition; thy dejected appearance ſtrikes a dread upon my mind, beyond the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of paternal tenderneſs to ſupport; the whole frame of nature within thee ſeems to border upon diſtraction; the agitating motions of thy ſoul, and irregular beating of thy pulſe, are certain omens of ſome approaching evil—retire to thy peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful habitation, and partake of the neceſſary calmneſs and tranquility—thou indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſome ungovernable paſſion, ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly phantom that deprives thee of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, reduces thee in reaſon beneath the ſtandard of a child, and bidding defiance to the exalted dignity of a man: reſtrain all doubtful timidity, and confidence in thy Maker, for all needful revelation for your inſtruction will be manifeſted in due time. If new dictates or prohibitions are ordained in heaven for the ſons of ADAM to rectify their lives, it will be declared at the Lord's appointed time to CAIN and ABEL; GOD will not permit ſucceeding children to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in darkneſs, and unacquainted with
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030283_0017_0FE5A1955F71B2A8"/>his will. But declare unto me, CAIN, from what hidden motives iſſues that gloom on thy countenance, and the ſource of thy inward calamity? Remove my aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! Ceaſe not to quell the diſturbance thou haſt created in my breaſt, and diſpel the anguiſh thou haſt brought on thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by concealing thy own grief—What moved thy earneſt ſolicitations? wherein is thy ſoul wounded? Relate thy trouble to EVE thy mother; perhaps her ſuperior knowledge in the virtue of herbs may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure ſome balſamic plant, that by her care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful preparation, may procure thee relief, reſtore thy diſordered frame to its former calmneſs, and baniſh from thy mind all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly perturbations.'</p>
            <p>To this diſcourſe of ADAM, CAIN be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to reply;</p>
            <p>'Oh, my father! let me not ſee my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! Parents of the miſereble! in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of my ſoul have I ſpoke thus. Anſwer me one queſtion, father.' 'Propoſe it my

'What is <hi>death?</hi>' ADAM replies; 'It is the change, CAIN, inſtituted by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be undergone by all mankind, at GOD's appointed time; it is the Lord's doing; we then ceaſe our mortal exiſtence, and return to GOD that made us.' 'ADAM my father, be thou again attentive to thy ſon; ſolve his doubts, remove his fears, and ſpeak for ABEL, thy child; my brother <hi>ſleepeth!</hi> a ſleep yet unknown to ADAM or EVE; Thoſe purple ſtreams that were wont to flow through the fibres of nature, and give activity to the vivid arteries of youth, are ſuddenly relaxed in their daily courſe, and become motionleſs, pale, and cold; the crimſon hae that adorned and beautified his chearful countenance is, like a bloſſom of ſnow, vaniſhed from ſight, and an icy ſtiffneſs ſubſtituted, to fix a permanent chillneſs on his once bloomy cheeks; thus lies ABEL, the favorite of heaven, extended on the moſſy bank, by the ſide of his ſtaring and hungry flock, bleating for daily food from his tender nurture; he lies inactive, plunged unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredly
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030283_0019_0FE5A1976DABC9A8"/>into that dubious ſtate thou ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of, by the hand of CAIN his brother! What have I done? Will he not again reſume life, to renew his daily diligence? to preſent his acceptable ſacrifices to his GOD, and his prayers to heaven to pacify offended wrath upon CAIN? I will haſten again unto him. Father follow thou me.</p>
            <p>CAIN outran his father, and came firſt to the horrid ſpot where ABEL ſtill lay.— 'I will,' ſaid he, 'with tears of lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, wipe the clotted blood from his lovely face before my father come, and pour over him the plaintive accents of my wounded ſoul; and in penſive ſtrains of grievous melancholy, utter with mournful ſadneſs the language of deſpair and repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. My brother! my brother! Have theſe hands produced the direful effects, originating in our parents firſt fall? is this death? Is the change pronounced up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the children of ADAM? Is this the curſe denounced for eating the forbidden fruit? Is this the road allotted for all mankind to

ABEL, thou anſwereſt me not; He continueth ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſilent! every organ of ſenſe is deprived of its neceſſary properties; the whole body overhung with gloomy ſadneſs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of CAIN's bitter reproaches on himſelf, he peaceably lays at reſt.— CAIN, ignominious infamy haſt thou en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed upon thy poſterity! behold the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſequences of thy implacable malice againſt thy inoffenſive brother; where gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs and meekneſs were always treaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to receive thee into his arms with fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and tender embraces. Heaven muſt be ſhocked at thy unnatural transformation from a brother to a murderer! deteſtable muſt thou be to thy own remembrance, to preſume to limit the boundaries of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's will, by deſtroying a life which thou neither gaveſt nor can reſtore! Here com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth my father in tears.'</p>
            <p>'ADAM, behold thy ſon; ſtep forward and touch him. Is this death?' ADAM after a few moments recovering from his
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:030283_0021_0FE5A1990011D280"/>ſhock, exclaimed, 'Curſed art thou in the ſight of GOD; and impiouſly infamous will be the deſcendants of thy loins.' Curſe me not ADAM! the curſes of ABEL alone from the ground will ſink me! Behold he is putrifying; he is haſtening with ſwift diſſolution to corruption, and preſently be united in nature with the earth that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports him; CAIN laments him, CAIN by him unnoticed. What father, muſt now be done? Lift up thy hand againſt CAIN, and retaliate with the blood of thy firſt born, for the death of thy younger ſon, that CAIN may accompany ABEL through 'the unknown regions of death.' No, CAIN; vengeance belongeth unto GOD.' ADAM now looking upon ABEL cries out 'My child! my child! ABEL my ſon! he anſwereth not his father! This muſt be to <hi>die!</hi> This muſt be <hi>death!</hi> From this hour muſt ADAM and EVE bid adieu to joy; for the father of men has lived to ſee before he taſted death. I go and fetch thy mother, to be a witneſs to the power of death.</p>

'No, father; wound not her tender feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with the woeful ſight.'</p>
            <p>O CAIN, this act of thine muſt exceed the threatened curſe? the life of ABEL was the gift of GOD; he alone had autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to take it away. Woe be unto thee, thou haſt involved us all in the guilty ſcene! The blood of ABEL will pierce the ſkies, and invoke Almighty vengeance for wrath upon us. Fly with rapidity, if creation can produce a cavern of darkneſs fit for thee! haſte upon the wings of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous timidity, and hide thee, if poſſible, from the preſence of GOD! But alas! no rock ſo dark, nor cave ſo deep, but the eyes of Omniſciency will detect thee! No work of creation, ever ſo diſmal or dreary, that would diſplay ſuch clemeney as to admit thee within the boſoms of their obſcurity, or vainly attempt to ſecure thee from the penetrations of Omnipotence! Humble thyſelf therefore before him: Let the ſmarting wounds of encreaſing peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence be mingled with the tears of deep

We know not the will of GOD; the wiſdom of Infinity is unſearchable; it exceeds our ſhallow capacities; our ideas are too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſined to judge thereof; he can—he may be merciful where mercy is not due, and pardon ſins that to us may appear unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable —Let, therefore, thy ſorrow be unfeigned; thy penitence devoutly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere; and without relaxation or intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion perſevere to the end of thy days; but be not vainly deceived with expectations of comfort or conſolation from ADAM, for his riper years are incapable of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtering it unto thee.</p>

            <p>After diſcharging this laſt mournful office for my child, I return to EVE thy mother, and communicate unto her the doleful tidings; and haſten thou to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe thy offended GOD.' This laſt office of paternal love being with ſolemnity and tears diſcharged, the Parent of mankind, with mournful and broken accents, bids adieu to the grave of ABEL, and takes farewell of unhappy CAIN; and with
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030283_0025_0FE5A1A0ED8751B8"/>wringing hands, and eyes overflowing with waters of grief, he haſtens through the ſhady bowers, moiſtening the graſs with the tears of lamentation, in ſearch of EVE his wife. EVE impatiently waiting the reſult of her huſband and ſon's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, was eagerly prepared to hear the news from the mouth of ADAM. He attempts to ſpeak; utteranee was denied him; faultering was his half lengthened ſyllables; and by long and forced expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, was the melancholy cataſtrophe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to the mother of men; to the mother of ABEL the <hi>dead</hi>—She no ſooner comprehended a ſufficiency of ADAM's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>articulate words, to diſpel all doubts in her mind, but her whole nature within her with an unuſual ſhriek, gave way to the unexpected ſhock; the voice of her ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies reached the very ſkies! In vain did ADAM apply every effort that tenderneſs and reaſon could dictate to reconcile her dejected mind to the weighty intelligence; but anguiſh had taken too deep root for
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030283_0026_0FE5A167BB5339B0"/>conjugal affection to remove; and, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the cold element, ſhe laid in an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtate of non-exiſtence; when at laſt coming to reaſon, ſhe lift up her eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ADAM with conſternation, and cries out;</p>
            <p>'Where are my two ſons? CAIN, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now come within hearing of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's voice, with the terrors of guilt and ſelf-cutting reproaches, flies towards the ſpot, and falling with his face to the ground exclaims:</p>

ADAM was ſpeechleſs; EVE almoſt ſenſeleſs; neither capable of giving vent to the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of pity or anger. The ſcene was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting; it was too diſtreſſing for the alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy wretched fratricide to ſupport; and with the terrors of conviction, inſeparable from conſcious guilt, and ſurrounded with
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030283_0027_0FE5A1A2ADFB8F88"/>the direful apprehenſions of lamenting deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, he quits the mournful ſpot of his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt lifeleſs parents, and ruminates ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfully where to fly to procure peace to his ſoul, and, if poſſible, to eſcape the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance of his GOD. 'I will again return,' ſays he, 'to the ſacred ſpot that faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encloſeth in its bowels the body of ABEL, now compounded with clay, and waiting its portion of time to mingle with its native duſt.' Thus ſaid, he haſtens towards the habitation of death—when behold, a voice from the clouds, like the ratling of provoked thunder, ſpeaks to him with the Majeſty of <hi>Omnipotence</hi>—</p>
            <p>'WHERE IS ABEL THY BROTHER?'</p>
            <p>Struck with horror, guilt, and fear, the infernal tempter was at hand, and inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into him a quick reply—<hi>'I know not: am I my brother's keeper?'</hi> Immediately ſentence of condign puniſhment was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon him by the GREAT JEHOVAH; and, to ſcreen him from the dangers of

What that mark was Scripture is ſilent; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently we can only form conjectures, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one as their imagination leads them: If my opinion may be given, (and which I do not wiſh to force upon another) it was this—<hi>That conſcious terror that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plays itſelf in the countenance of every mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, when the queſtion is confronted unto him with ſtrong ſuſpicions</hi>—with this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant difference—<hi>that it was always ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in the face of Cain, as the concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of guilt to the day of his death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CAIN having received the chaſtiſing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lediction of provoked Heaven, heavily proceeds towards the grave of ABEL: languiſhing as he walks, he bemoans, with grievous lamentation, the empire that ſin had erected within him; and with heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rending complaints, on the eve of diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he arrives at the mournful ſpot! <hi>the

            <p>Thus ſaid, he returns to his father and mother. ADAM beheld him advancing, and drawing towards him, perceives the <hi>mark</hi> of GOD, and ſays—'CAIN, what is this? thy countenance has the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of nature's tranſmutation! CAIN replies—'Father give ear to the words of the unhappy!

Can forlorn hopes, or humble acquieſcence to Divine mandates diſpel the turbulency of raving madneſs? Retaliate ADAM for the blood of ABEL, by ſolicitation for Heaven's permiſſion to diſunite the ſoul and body of CAIN. He is, he can be no more than an incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance on the earth; the ground whereon his foot reſteth will be defiled by the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his image; barrenneſs will proceed after the footſteps of the curſed delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent.

            <p>Thus he importunes ADAM to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his life; ADAM was ſilent; he again proceeds—</p>

            <p>'No, Cain; the will of GOD muſt be obeyed.—EVE ſearcely recovered from her firſt confuſed ſtate of mind at ADAM's relating the melancholy event, could barely ſummon fortitude enough to enter into a renewed diſcourſe with CAIN or her huſband; but ſhe thus begins—</p>
            <p>"ADAM, my ſpouſe, my other half, let us not anticipate evil; there is an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Providence who ruleth all wordly mutations, and where celeſtial goodneſs deigns to protect and provide for the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt inſect and twiſting reptile; Comfort CAIN, that he may not plunge us into encreaſing troubles by diſtruſting the cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency of his GOD; dejection ſitteth on his brow; his attitude is that of madneſs! Join thy feeling with mine ADAM, and let us mingle compaſſion with his flowing agonies—We may aſſociate paternal pity and commiſeration, as the ſame time we

            <p>CAIN was ſtill in a poſture of deep hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation —his grief overballanced the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of impreſſed nature, and his ſoul heavy laden with the burden of affliction; the flowing drops iſſue from his ſwollen eyes, and fall to the ground like globulets of an heavy ſtorm, the ſound of which rouſed ADAM and EVE from their ſtate of deep conſideration how to adviſe him—when ſuddenly, as if guided by the hand of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, they look in the face of CAIN, and without a uttering a word, both fell proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate with their faces on the earth, and moiſtened the graſs with the dumb waters of ſympathy.</p>
            <p>Thus our firſt parents lay, deprived of the organs of ſpeech, but with groanings and lamentations that echoed through the whole diverſity of nature's delightful ſpace; the utmoſt boundaries of creation were
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030283_0034_0FE5A171EB379170"/>ſmitten with the uncommon ſound; all the inhabitants of the foreſt were diſturbed by the unuſual echoes: The ravenous beaſts of prey, the winged tribe of jocal harmony, the inſects that hovered in the airy element and the little unnoticed reptile that twirls under foot, felt the effect of murder; and thrown into an unſual profound ſilence and terror, neither motion, voice or ſound could be perceived on that ſide EDEN, but the broken, the plaintive accents of ADAM and EVE.</p>
            <p>CAIN ſtood like an engraven ſtatue of raving phrenzy, ſpeechleſs, and motionleſs with eyes intenſely fixed upon his father and mother. Thus lay the firſt parents of mankind; thus ſtands before them the firſt murderer in the world.</p>

            <p>'ADAM, 'tis prudent, 'tis the counſel of diſcretion for us to put a reſtraint upon immoderate grief, and not indulge the woes of an irretrievable malady.' Then embracing ADAM as her partner in calam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, ſhe thus begins; 'ADAM my huſband, the joy of my ſoul; ſee before us our firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born, ſinking under the load of dreadful expectation; although the title of parent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſoftneſs is forfeited, let us not withhold from him the compaſſion of pity; Is not that eſtabliſhed in the bowels of our affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? What muſt be done? Give me leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of inſtruction, and I will deliver them
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030283_0036_0FE5A1780F0D7848"/>with improved admonition to our unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſon; I can promiſe myſelf ſucceſs from thy nature and ripened deliberations: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him before us! 'tis a melting ſcene; let us be tender towards him, it may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his ſoul to ſerenity, or we know not what a fatal moment of diſtraction may produce, when all the faculties are in a ſtate of derangement; he may add iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to iniquity, and commit a ſuicide on himſelf; if this evil alſo befal us, unceaſing and unavailing ſorrow muſt accompany us all the days of our life; the pleaſures of every ſacred as well as moral duties will be baniſhed from us; and all private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations in our various circumſtances of life will feel its effects, even in the midſt of theſe unforeſeen viciſſitudes that our <hi>Maker</hi> has ordained for us to encounter; it will obſtruct us in paying obedience to the Divine commands, by a continual prey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon our vital parts, rendering us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable and unfit for the ſervices required of us: beſides, ADAM, thou knoweſt the Lord is merciful: he tempers judgment
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:030283_0037_0FE5A1AEE4FD3530"/>with clemency; there are ſtill beams of hope left for our child; the Lord preſerved <hi>us</hi> from deſtruction for the <hi>firſt</hi> tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; we involved our children and their ſucceſſive generations in ſin to the end of time, or CAIN would have been a ſtranger to jealouſy or hatred to his brother; give reflection a ſeat in thy boſom; May we not juſtly attribute a portion of CAIN's crime to our firſt fall? We planted the ſeeds of ſin, he only plucked the fruit; and 'tis impoſſible for us in this infantile ſtate of nature, to conceive the different kinds and qualities of fruit that will be produced from the tree of ſin that we planted; they will differ widely in degrees of magnitude and circumſtance; yet all, proportionable to their enormity, deſtructive of that primeval innocence in which we were created; Let us endeavour to relieve his depreſſion, to adminiſter conſolation unto him, and with joyful gratulation, he will return cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thankfulneſs; leave him not ſinking under the weight of ingrafted impiety,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030283_0038_0FE5A179EC19B7F8"/>transfuſed into him with his mother's milk; CAIN was not the firſt ſinner; Are not <hi>we</hi> alſo baniſhed the preſence of the Lord? ſtill we have hope; let us hope alſo for our child. If the increaſe of the earth is withheld from the labours of his own til<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, ſtill nature itſelf is abundantly ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſupply all his wants. The Lord has rejected his future ſacrifices; then CAIN need not Till the ground—Pardon is trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured up in heaven for repentance, or ADAM and EVE would be now as ABEL. Speak, my huſband, what words ſhall I utter to my ſon? Let me alleviate the pain, if I cannot prevent the growth of grief by ſin allotted him, or it will eat deeper into his ſoul, beyond the penetration of paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal feelings, and beyond the power of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to moliify."</p>
            <p>ADAM all this time was ſoberly attentive to the words of EVE, but could not ſubdue the riſing tumults of paſſion againſt CAIN, that did at intervals force itſelf upon him; but ſtill he ſtrived againſt the depreſſions
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030283_0039_0FE5A1B1DAA5A3D8"/>that human infirmities made upon his mind; he ſtrived in vain to ſtop the ſources that produced ſighs and moans for his child; he attempted to unboſom his mind in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance to EVE, but the power and vivacity of utterance had left him, and like a lifeleſs image he falls again to the earth. CAIN was no longer able to ſupport himſelf under the melancholy ſcene, and began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt himſelf in the moſt poignant accents of grief—</p>
            <p>'CAIN, CAIN, witneſs the effects of thy obduracy! conſider the baneful conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of thy luſtful enmity againſt thy bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!

            <p>ADAM, by a ſudden emotion proceeding from thoſe terrible words of CAIN, and trembling at the baneful project nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the boſom of his ſon, looks up, and

               <hi>CAIN's LAMENTATIONS</hi> OVER ABEL. BOOK THE SECOND.</head>
            <p>THE irregular imaginations that now ſucceeded each other in the mind of CAIN gave all nature the appearance of a new creation; every viſible object ſtrikes anaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſideration into his ſoul; he ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to collect his ſcattered reaſon, and to bring to mind the ſtate from whence he was fallen, and to pacify his ſoul by a compoſed reconcilement to the inflictive chaſtiſement of GOD, and with calm forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſubmit to theſe diſpenſations of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and thus began to commune with himſelf:</p>

'I am ſtill an inhabitant amongſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a ſtranger to the <hi>beauties</hi> of creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on —Where will my wandering footſteps lead me? A ſolemn and ſad ſilence muſt be my nightly as well as daily companion; and the peaceful habitation of ADAM and EVE will produce renewed bitterneſs to my reflections; I would hope for conſolation; then ſays ADAM my father, 'build thy expectations upon penitence.' 'Religion is my aim; then ſays EVE my mother, cultivate an acquaintance with thy GOD! Peace of mind I would compound with lengthened days; then conſcience tells me, 'to plant the ſeeds of contrition with dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble care, and daily water them with the tears of remorſe, and thou ſhalt reapt the fruit of tranquility; petition Heaven, the ſource of good, and its ſpiritual eſſence will not be denied thee; let an emulative increaſe of virtuous actions prompt thee forward, and thou wilt attain a ſufficiency of power to withſtand and accumalate a portion of pious reſignation, to enable thee to encounter courageouſly with all the

            <p>'What have been hitherto the days of the years of CAIN? Ignorance and folly began them, pain and ſorrow now attend them—preſerve the end of them O LORD, from everlaſting deſtruction. Thou art <hi>merciful,</hi> make me ſupplicating—thou art <hi>glorious,</hi> make me humble—thou art <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious,</hi> make me thankful. If CAIN cannot reſtore the life of ABEL, teach him how to obtain remiſſion for the crime; actuate him by a lively improvement in religion, that thy <hi>glory</hi> may be celebrated by his humiliation; and ſtimulated by conviction
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:030283_0064_0FE5A1D7B0C73E60"/>may keep in due exerciſe all his rational faculties for the promulgation of holineſs and righteouſneſs in his ſoul, ſo that at the laſt he may arrive to a peaceful tranquility?</p>
            <p>Thus communed CAIN with himſelf as he ſoberly drew forward into the thicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grove; when ſuddenly a ruſtling among the interwoven branches, with an hideous howl, obſtructed his progreſs and ſtruck an icy chillneſs into his whole frame; but ſupported by the power of faith in his GOD, he ventures on, and faintly beheld the beautiful ſpots that curiouſly adorned the untamed and ferocious <hi>Leopard,</hi> whoſe ferocity itſelf was reduced to a ſtate of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic terror at the ſight of MAN! ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction had <hi>ſin</hi> made on the irrational ideas of the brute creation. CAIN with conſternation beheld him, and the terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beaſt makes half ſtares in return, with eyes ſparkling with ſavage voracity, eager to devour, but fearful to attack, the diſturber of his reſt, and with ſtern looks and a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous roar, he turns tail and flies affrighted
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:030283_0065_0FE5A2184886C510"/>into the wood. Every concomitant of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming apprehenſions now poſſeſſed CAIN'S imaginations, and no commiſeration near, nor conſoling friend to participate in his fears, and he thus ſpeaks to himſelf;</p>
            <p>Vain conceptions deceive me; there are mutations requiſite in the nature of CAIN that requires the wiſdom and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Omnipotence</hi> to bring to paſs; terror will ſtill accompany guilt—My ſoul is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded within me; the frightful mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter diſcompoſed all my contemplations, and ſubſtituted an impreſſion of dread; the hardened, the premeditated impiety of CAIN precludes all ſelf abilities to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim; the performance exceeds the lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its of his intellectual capacities; it cannot be done without the aid of <hi>Heaven.</hi> A wretched outcaſt, a notorious delinquent, cannot become virtuous unleſs the change is conducted through the channel of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven!— Can the thoughts? can the actions of one be pure whoſe conduct was never regulated by an upright rule? Can a
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:030283_0066_0FE5A1D99ACD1580"/>fratricide become a moral of perfection? O CAIN! contract thy ideas of future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs —extend not thy hopes beyond due deliberation; repentance muſt be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wearied productions of time; thy flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expectations of ſolitude may deceive thee; it may prove unto thee as dreaming deluſions—Ages to come cannot recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe what is paſt. Haſt thou tears in ſtore ſufficient to waſh the veſſel of thy enormities clean? Canſt thou render up unto GOD ſacrifices of affliction propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to thy brother's blood? Let not thine eyes be blinded; hide not the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of thy heart from thyſelf: leave not a vacuum; permit not a cavity to remain unſearched, that dark concluſions may not abide with thee. Can a <hi>Leopard</hi> affright thee? How then faceſt thou thy GOD that in a moment can cruſh thee? Thou attempteſt to draw realities from almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probabilities; before another ſetting ſun all nature may be to thee as nothing—Degrade not thy preſent knowledge with darkened proſpects; for thy firſt enemy
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:030283_0067_0FE5A21AB8B43858"/>is ſtill aſſailing thee under different diſguiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.' Into this diſcompoſed ſtate was the ſoul of CAIN thrown by the equally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted beaſt, and ſelf accuſations againſt himſelf; and from the effects of gloomy apprehenſions, and fear of repeated tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, his calmneſs and ſerenity had again forſaken him, and thus was his mind in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbered with foreboding diſaſters; he ſoftly and fearfully paſſes the entangled branches, which retarded his cautions mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by their twiſted fibres; he again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to talk with himſelf—</p>
            <p>'This place is peculiarly adapted to a contemplative and innocent mind—What ſayeſt thou CAIN?—<hi>Innocence!</hi>—Thou haſt forfeited that inheritance; It may be recoverable.'</p>
            <p>The ſable cloathing of darkneſs had now almoſt extinguiſhed the feeble light that at intervals penetrated through the opening clouds, and he looks about for a thickened covert, wherein to take his
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030283_0068_0FE5A1DBAABAF318"/>night's repoſe; and at a ſmall diſtance perceived an encloſure uncommonly cloſe, compoſed of brambles and woodbines, and briars, ſo firmly united, it repreſented to his view, by the help of glimmering light, an arbour of ſhrubby ſweetneſs; 'Here concealed,' ſays he, 'I may get eaſe from affliction.' As cautiouſly and ſoftly as he trod the dewy moſs, yet ſtill with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive conſternation he perceived that almoſt every ſtep produced a diſcord amongſt the interwoven branches; the harmleſs feathered tribe experienced the unuſual diſturbance by the ſudden emotion and movements of the pliable twigs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they had perched to bid adieu to the univerſal harmony of the day, and enjoy in ſilent peace their nightly repoſe! the whole family of the little melodious choriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters was alarmed and terrified, and, as quick as their half opened eyes would permit endeavoured to extricate themſelves from the leaves and branches, and haſte a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval; and with timorous motions, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their eſcape with ſcarce extended wing
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:030283_0069_0FE5A21CEDCF0530"/>hopping from twig to twig, till the enemy of their peace, the encroacher upon their quiet aſylum, had made a further progreſs, and got beyond their tender ſenſations; at the ſame time the ſavage race, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamely brood of four-footed creatures, ſlowly quit their dreadful coverts for the unwelcome gueſt, with eyes fiercely rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſtubborn reluctance, turn round, and almoſt bid him defiance; and, with countenance ferociouſly aghaſt, boldly ſtare to behold the cauſe of the general conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; timorous to encounter yet vora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly eager to devour, the untimely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder. The threatening aſpects of thoſe enraged animals, ſtruck additional horror into his ſoul, weakened his reſolutions, and even ſtaggered his moſt courageous fortitude; while the ſmaller works of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the diminutive infects, that thought to have, as uſual, ſlept in peaceful dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs amongſt the warm and pliant leaves, felt alſo the untimely ſhock, and with the ſudden bending of the boughs, tumbled by ſwarms from their eaſy reſt, and fell
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:030283_0070_0FE5A1DD37ED0440"/>as innocent victims in multitudes to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileſs tread; ſome inſtantaneouſly cruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to death, and others left in helpleſs ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies under the pangs of wounds and mang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led limbs beyond the healing of nature's kind reſtorative; and the twiſting rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles for which <hi>Providence</hi> had provided a comfortable canopy from the inclemency of the ſeaſons under the thick moſſy graſs and autumnal leaves, that lay in heaps like little mountains on the ground, even theſe experienced the tremendous commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and with the ſagacity of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, took refuge under the ſturdy roots of ſternly oaks, creeping amongſt the cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt twinings of the ſpreading bottom, where the cruel foot-ſteps of the enemy could not penetrate, nor the weight of his guilty carcaſe impreſs with dire effect.</p>
            <p>CAIN, during this time, ruminating ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly on the unprovoked attack he had made upon the awful ſience of creation, and how effectually, though undeſigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, he had effected an enmity between man
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:030283_0071_0FE5A21E86F66110"/>and the works of GOD, the whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion becoming deteſtably fearful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingly ſubſervient unto him. Reaſon began now to aſſiſt him in his contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and he makes an halt amidſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled inhabitants of the grove, and delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately pauſing on the evil he had cauſed amongſt them, concluded that himſelf muſt eſcape danger, while all creatures ſeemed to dread him. The aſpect of the moon's rays was now become ſcarce viſible; lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more than a bare glimmering ſhadow of light, hardly perceptible through the thick entanglements of the wood, and ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſlowly he draws towards the cloſe encloſure—'it may be,' ſays he, 'the nightly covert of ſome ravenous beaſt;' —And with cautious magnanimity he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates the almoſt jointed leaves, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veys with narrow inſpection the deſirous, yet fearful place; ſilence ſeemed to be wrapped up in its obſcurity; the motions or breathings of life could not be perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; even air itſelf was almoſt prohibited
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:030283_0072_0FE5A1E0C079F2C0"/>admiſſion; ſo cloſe, ſo joined, was this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary receſs on all ſides; the more tender and flexible branches he gradually remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and gained an entrance into this ſeat of penſive ſilence; and with conſcientious congratulations to <hi>Providence</hi> for protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he entered the quiet and peaceful retreat, and calmly compoſed himſelf for retirement with the inhabitants of the wood. —Thus meeting with no obſtruction by art or nature, to diſcourage or diſcompoſe him, he firſt addreſſes his <hi>Maker</hi> in ſtrains of humble ejaculations; and then laid him down to reſt with that pleaſing ſenſation that frequently accompanies and is conju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal with fatigued nature, and undiſturbed falls into a profound ſleep—Veiled as the ordinations of Heaven were towards him, he reſts on the ſoft and untrodden moſs in ſacred ſecurity.</p>
            <p>Thus ſleeps CAIN, under the luxuriant branches, regardleſs of danger, with the complacency of innocence, till night had finiſhed its appointed courſe, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livening
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:030283_0073_0FE5A22430B8CF10"/>rays of the morning ſun began to dart its refreſhing beams through the narrow openings of the disjointed branches and forewarned CAIN againſt too long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence; the diligent meſſenger of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was diſcharging his Creator's errand, by making his daily circuit round the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal expanſe; the earlieſt little ſongſters had begun to chaunt the morning praiſes to their Maker, with the grateful melody of united concord harmoniouſly delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; the thrilling voices and native accents proceeding from their warbling throats, awoke the penſive ſleeper, and ſummoned him to the duties of awakening day; CAIN looks around him and minutely inſpects his humble manſion, and thus begins to reaſon with himſelf;</p>
            <p>'There muſt be a bounteous, a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful munificence in the diſpenſations of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence! This ſhall be the abode of CAIN; the deſolate will here take up his dwelling; he may here diminiſh his grief, and enjoy
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030283_0074_0FE5A1E37123F0D8"/>a <hi>portion</hi> if not a <hi>permanency</hi> of ſolitary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation; he can uninterruptedly revere the <hi>juſtice</hi> and admire the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of GOD; and remembrance of iniquities paſt may check future ingratitude and folly.'</p>
            <p>Thus CAIN communeth with himſelf and arranges his fancies and reſolutions into a ſtate of regularity, and then poſtrates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before GOD, humbly and ſervently ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating his benignity and influence to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able him to accompliſh the deſires of his ſoul; 'I know,' ſays he, 'before I can by rectitude arrive to the notice of Heaven, I muſt, in the poſture of humility, firſt learn to abominate myſelf with contrition at the footſtool of it; <hi>I know, O God, thy knowledge is impenetrable; that all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward motions of my heart are within thy preſcience, ere they are fulfilled, and the myſteries of futurity are appointed by thy unerring decrees; nothing can paſs thy Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſciency unnoticed, or eſcape the tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant depth of thy wiſdom, infinite in itſelf, and infinitely beyond all human conception;
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:030283_0075_0FE5A2260FBA17B0"/>therefore, O God, beſtow ſuch a portion of thy beatitudes upon me as is neceſſary, and bleſs it unto me for good; teach me how to bend myſelf before thee with ſubmiſſive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence; calm the ſtormy tempeſts of my ſoul, and let ſcenes of evil be no longer nouriſhed in my breaſt.</hi>'</p>
            <p>He now ariſes from the ground and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes the birds of the air, and the air it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf —'Be ſilent, ye chearful inhabitants of the grove; chaunt not your harmonious voices, ye inoffenſive warblers, and give a reſpite to your little muſical throats for a ſeaſon; and ye boiſtrious and powerful winds, for a time be ſtill; let not your convulſive accents purſue me rigorouſly into the doleful habitation of ſadneſs? diſturb not my ejaculations by your irregular diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of ſounds; and all ye, the living per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect works of creation, commiſſerate me, yet happily innocent of my wants; your eſtabliſhed innocency ſcreens you from all evil deſires; your wiſhes and wants are

            <p>CAIN now began to aſſume the rational man with lamentations for ABEL, and reflecting on his death; and with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of conviction upon him would cry out, '<hi>O my brother Abel! my brother Abel!</hi> couldſt thou hear me, couldſt thou obtain permiſſion from Heaven to make a viſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

I will endeavour in this loneſome cell to make penitential reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ABEL's blood; and in this unfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented ſhade dedicate my tears to that needful purſuit; and by mingling my pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence in concert with my irrational com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, maintain fortitude with humility to protect me from a life miſerably unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; commune with myſelf to regret leſs the loſs of ſociety; I would wiſh to improve the purpoſes of my baniſhment that the hopes of ADAM and EVE might not be fruſtrated; let a dilemma of fears, let a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth of doubts intrude themſelves upon me, my hopes ſhall not be beclouded, my expectations ſhall not be ſunk in the pit of deſpondency, nor my promiſed comforts overwhelmed with dejection.

<pb n="81" facs="unknown:030283_0079_0FE5A229AD538018"/>become proportionably unmindful; a fatiety of content cannot be expected while mixed with a croud of unweary perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, therefore will I not hazard my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſerenity; the world may be inviting to injuries; and embarraſs my ſoul to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; in the moment of anger I may ſlay my brother's advocate, for the reproaches, of the ſcornful will be very inflicting, and the guilty are reſtleſs under contempt; my infantile reaſoning is not yet capable of meaſuring the dimenſions of provoked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veteracy; I will not join the latter off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of ADAM and thus eſcape the ſhafts of their calumny; nor ſhall their bitter language wound my feelings; my grievous ſpirit none of them will heal; while their pointed arrogancy will court my frowning obſervations without alleviation; my ſighs will be their melody, and with my own la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations will they torment me, and make my days miſerable for want of pity and commiſeration.'</p>
            <p>Thus reaſoneth the forſaken fratricide
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:030283_0080_0FE5A1E9B3D39018"/>with himſelf to ſhun ſociety; and though he is grievouſly doubtful of his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, yet ſcrupulouſly exact in his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors; ſtriving to command himſelf with judgment, while he ſuſpects himſelf of the power of obedience; and thus ſucceſſive ideas takes their revolutions in his mind, and paſſes promiſcuouſly over his ſelf-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching ſoul. 'I muſt not,' ſaid he, 'by deſpondency, defeat my purſuits after wiſdom; I have variegated nature in this uncorrupted abode of ſolitude to melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate my heart with noble and delicious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, 'tis a ſituation tranſcendantly conſpicuous for contemplation, and where folly will ſcarce gain admiſſion; here will I begin to become acquainted with ſacred piety, and enter into an indiſſoluble union and communion with my innocent and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodious companions, whoſe daily adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to their Maker give motion to the pliable branches with the energy of their vocal praiſes.</p>
            <p>O ye chearful inhabitants of the grove,

CAIN now ſoftens his calamities with hopes of peace, and walks the wood to ſee how far its produce was productive of thoſe neceſſaries conſiſtent with his ſituation; he was ſoon convinced nature had been prolific, and in an ample manner provided all things needful for his ſupport—this revived his ſoul—gratitude here required no deliberation; and after offering that ſacrifice, he began to partake of nature's repaſt, without reluctance. Plentifully did the fruits of various kinds yield their juicy contents for his refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Calm ſerenity now occupied his breaſt, and a tranquil reſignation compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to his fate—he found the ſpot to be calculated for the indulgence of reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and improvement of reaſon.'</p>
            <p>Thus we leave him under the protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Heaven, improving under the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of ſolitude for <hi>days,</hi> and <hi>months,</hi> and <hi>years;</hi> and the bounties of Nature ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

'Twas at the cloſe of day when ſable darkneſs was approaching, the whole creation huſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſolemn ſilence, and every living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had bid adieu to activity for the night, that CAIN was raiſed from a religious le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy of pious contemplations by a <hi>ſhrill</hi> and <hi>uncommon</hi> ſound, like the voice of a <hi>ſpirit,</hi> but <hi>inarticulate,</hi> like the words of a <hi>man,</hi> but <hi>incomprehenſible;</hi> and darkneſs was become a total deprivation of percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the ſound came nearer, and like the voice of ſoftneſs entered his ear:
<q>'Cain, Cain, I am an ambaſſador from Heaven; haſte and obey the voice of thy God.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>CAIN looks and feels, but nothing could be ſeen or felt; and being by years of meditation prepared for the <hi>infernal</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, he ſpoke in this wiſe; Who art thou? What is thy miſſion?</p>

               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:030283_0083_0FE5A23141AD42A0"/>
The ſpirit replies—<hi>'I am commiſſioned by the God of Heaven to conduct thee thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther —Thy penitence is accepted—thy mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification is no longer needful; follow me; the regions of eternal delight await thee; the atiributes of</hi> GOD <hi>are</hi> juſtice <hi>and</hi> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; <hi>he delighteth not in puniſhment; eaſily offended, eaſily appeaſed; thy iniquities are forgiven, and he is pacified.'</hi>

            <p>CAIN ſpake—'Whoſe voice? What worda can thoſe be? Art thou a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from ABEL'S GOD? If ſo, why com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou in gloomy darkneſs?

'If ſo,' ſays CAIN, 'let the light of thy glory direct my footſteps—meaſure unto me the unbounded ſpace to heaven, and circumſcribe its dimenſions ere I quit my peaceful retreat.'</p>
            <q>'Cain thy conceptions of etherial tracts are diſordered: the path lays wide through deſerts unknown.'</q>

            <p>The reſolutions of CAIN were effectual —the tempter was overcome, and in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs again departed; the long preparatory contemplations and dependence upon GOD enabled CAIN to render all his machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions abortive. Having thus eſcaped the powerful inſinuations of the devil, he ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders up to Heaven his grateful adorations for the deliverance, and lays him down to

            <p>CAIN now quits his bower, and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, walks to the boundaries of the wood, to enjoy without obſtruction the beauties of opening day; and looking towards the delightful EDEN, (from whence he was ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed) even to the utmoſt limits of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion's horizon, as far as eyes could trace, an object uncommon attracted his attentive notice; the yet feeble rays of the ſun beams preſented to his views a deep wounding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flective appearance—What did he ſee? What did he imagine he really ſaw thro' the reſplendency of the morning's infant
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:030283_0087_0FE5A2355B032558"/>brightneſs? At an immenſe diſtance, a ſpace almoſt exceeding occular demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he beheld in the ſtarry orb a <hi>coeleſtial harbinger</hi>—he cries out, moved by the different paſſions of <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi> 'Art <hi>thou a meſſenger of peace?'</hi> Again he turns his eyes from beholding, then again aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth courage, and ventures on a retroſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive glance, and ruminates in his mind up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the works of creation, to draw ſome comparative concluſion, and bring his ſoul into a ſtate of ſteady compoſure; but he found the higher his conceptions aſpired, the lower did his real attainments ſink, for all nature dwindled into nothing in his ſight, when compared to the illuſtrious <hi>Gueſt;</hi> and with exalted rapture and aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, he opens his lips towards <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>—' 'Tis an <hi>angel!</hi> he bringeth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort unto CAIN!

            <p>The angel makes but ſlow advances, as if prohibited by the injunctions of his Mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, fulfilling the divine appointment with majeſtic obedience, and delivers his meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage at a ſtately diſtance, with an implicit diligence and profound ſilence. Thus was CAIN, whoſe heart was wont to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable to the voice of humanity and filial pity, rendered tractable and ſoft by the penetration of the <hi>caeleſtial</hi> monitor; for ſome time his eyes were intent upon the ground, unable to ſpeak for paſt reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and then again he reaſonably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munes with himſelf, and ſpeedily haſtens forward, and ſoon loſt ſight of the ſolitary dwelling—as he runs he ruminates—'This omen,' ſays he, 'cannot portend evil; the wrath of offended juſtice cannot be execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under ſuch a promiſing diſguiſe—my ſoul, be thou quiet? <hi>paſſion</hi> and <hi>deſpair,</hi> fly from me! <hi>deſpondency</hi> and <hi>doubts,</hi> bid

CAIN now became ſilent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſing, and his mind ſedate, on the pleaſure of his own reflections over SATAN —Still did the bright <hi>image of glory</hi> remain in the expanded aether; and as the ſun
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:030283_0090_0FE5A1F8311552A8"/>gradually approached its meridian, ſo did the angelic luſtre appear more and more viſible; and with an aſpect of ſmiling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity, ſeemed to court, with a pleaſing countenance, the nearer approaches of CAIN, whoſe conſcious integrity on <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> convinced him no evil could be conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under ſuch a tranſparency: his joys were now rapturous; no fears could ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify him; no ideas could ſink him—yet ſtill, in theſe encouraging ſeaſons of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, he had at intervals ſome trying con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts with his inviſible foe; but accoutred with the armour of conſtancy, and the heavenly monitor in view, he could, with confident temerity, reſiſt all the efforts of of SATAN; the ſubtlety of hell could not touch his conſtancy with its deſtructive bane.</p>
            <p>The ſun was now arrived at its meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an altitude, directly over the head of CAIN; and proportionable to the elevated power of the ſun, did the inimitable excellence of the ſhining one appear; the ſparkling

            <p>Experience has been as an inſtructive leſſon unto CAIN, that in ſecret ſilence there is ſacred ſafety—the tongue is curb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the lips are guarded, and the mouth reſtrained from uttering deſtructive words; theſe are the ſeaſons to bow at GOD'S <hi>Throne;</hi> his preſence will chear the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and his benevolence infuſe joy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the breaſt of the ſupplicant; Almighty condeſcenſion will inſtill raptures longings for devotion, and eſtabliſh its heavenly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences within me.'</p>

The ſun had now turned towards its decline, to make room for approaching night, and CAIN, looking towards his guardianangel, perceived a proportionable diminution of the illuſtrious ſmile which brought the following conſiderations to his mind: 'And will the favourable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of a communication with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to be loſt with the expiring courſe of one fun's daily race?

            <p>As theſe impreſſive emotions and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternations gave way to calm and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate reaſoning, he began to enjoy a ſerene ſtate of mind, and peace flowed abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into his foul; and again looking towards the bright embaſſador of joy in the firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he very intently viewed, and with accurate diſcernment, obſerved more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly the ſpiritual viſage; and ſtedfaſtly looking he deſcried ſome famt repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of <hi>Man,</hi> ſurrounded with the ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling luſtre—undaunted, and with manly fortitude he gazes, and with eyes devoted to further uſeful and neceſſary diſcoveries,

            <p>The power of the ſun was now much diminiſhed—its warmth and heat wen rapidly declining; and its forcible effects on CAIN'S perceptions was much abated he could therefore look more diſtinctly through its feeble orbs, and by clear diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment from his conjectures on the <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelic hoſt:</hi> He looks; he is amazed, as the miſſionary of Heaven becomes more and more viſible; his whole frame was in a pleaſing, and at the ſame time aſtoniſhed agitation; and every ſtep he advances brings to his ideas more proof of the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Being now ſuitably prepared in his mind for the <hi>divine miſſion,</hi> he turned his eyes towards the ſky, and behold, what did he ſee but the <hi>angel of God near</hi> him!

            <p>ABEL, gently deſcending from the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clouds, ſoftly whiſpers into his ear, with the voice of real ſympathy and love—'<hi>Cain, my brother!</hi> Ariſe, anger findeth no dwelling in Heaven—malice is forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to enter that holy reſidence; no envy, no embittered hatred is cheriſhed in the boſom of ABEL; remembrance of paſt evils can find no footing amongſt Saints; the excellencies of glory are allotted to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BEL, and the GOD thereof can ſecure a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of its beauties for CAIN his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

            <p>'CAIN, my brother,' replies ABEL, 'healing is in my wings; reſplendent kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is my charge; thou ſhalt enjoy the utility of thy penitence; the throne of GOD is never ſhut againſt fervent ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; the miſeries of anguiſh, and the ſores of lamentation will be always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by Heaven with conſolations; the ſtrength of ſorrow is never permitted to be unprofitably exhauſted; if thy allotted portion of experience are labour, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and pain, know, CAIN, 'tis the fruits of the firſt ſin, concentered in the enjoyments of all mankind; be thou there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore comforted, and contentment and peace will ſpontaneouſly ſhoot forth and ſurround thee in the midſt of ſolitude.

            <p>CAIN now enters the inhabited place amidſt crouds of numerous ſpectators; he was aſtoniſhed! 'Twas impoſſible for him to bring his ideas of their actions to any concluſions; and according to his concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men and things, they appeared unto him as running to and fro for nought, very intent upon doing nothing; buſily employed to no purpoſe, removing their ſituations, and making exchange of places.</p>
            <p>Here CAIN took him a wife, had child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and built a city.<note n="*" place="bottom">'Tis very probable that CAIN was, at entering the land of NOD, two hundred years old, which is the ſmalleſt computation we can admit; for it was a <hi>peopled</hi> country, and the inhabitants muſt be lineally deſcended from ADAM, and of courſe to the third or fourth generation; and even this itſelf, in my opinion, comes far ſhort of the age of CAIN when he entered the land; for at this time there could be no more than the fourth generation of ADAM in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and by refering to Sacred Writ, you will find even at that age he muſt be married to one of his ſiſters' daughters, or his own ſiſter; which almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a contradiction, and will not bear the leaſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible alluſion to ſacred record; becauſe, while he liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the land, he built a city—The building a city, be it ever ſo ſmall, muſt indiſputably require <hi>many</hi> hands more than can be reaſonably ſuppoſed to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from his own loins, or his brothers' or ſiſters, even if he was married in that infantile ſtate of the world before mentioned; conſequently in my opinion I think we may juſtly conclude that CAIN was three or four hundred years old when he entered the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, or at leaſt before he began building; by which time the offspring of ADAM and EVE, before and after the death of ABEL, might be increaſed, as well as the generations of SETH, and the other ſons and daughters of ADAM born after SETH; and even at this age of the world there could be but few ſpare hands when a city was building—I think a certain Commentator on the Bible that ſays,— '<hi>about the ſixtieth year of the world Cain murdered Abel</hi> —comes ſhort of the truth; eſpecially if he ſuppoſes CAIN immediately flew for ſhame to the Land of NOD, and took him a wife.</note>

            <p>Here ADAM ceaſed, and CAIN begins;</p>
            <p>'ADAM, my <hi>glorified Father,</hi> I am not eſtranged to the lengthened lenity of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence towards me; through his abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love are my days prolonged; although the twiſting reptiles in the graſs are more innocent in nature, and fulfil the intent of <hi>Creation</hi> with more obedient conformity to his will, yet is CAIN noticed by his tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and compared to the <hi>angels</hi> in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Speak again, my father—Where is

            <p>'ADAM replies—' <hi>Eve is living</hi>—fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and fervent have been her offerings to <hi>Heaven</hi> ſince bidding adieu to her child; many have been the tears of hopeleſs ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy dropped compaſſionately from her ſtill ſwollen eyes, when the dreadful ſcene did occur to remembrance; and, with the weeping of unreſtraining grief, would cry out—<hi>'Woe be to me! alas, my children! one is dead, and another loſt from me for ever!'</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Oftentimes was the manly fortitude of ADAM ſtaggered to maintain his ſuperior reſolutions; and, at the weak intervals of reaſon, would imperceptibly draw from his aged eyes the watry drops of painful me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory —againſt the flowings of nature's weakneſs did he ſtruggle, and combat with the weighty reflections of his own ſoul, to

            <p>CAIN again ſpeaks—'Could CAIN meet his mother, and embrace his aged parent if he goes to ſeek her? tranſported would he fly on the wings of rapidity, and let her witneſs the triumphant virtue that reigns in the boſom of CAIN—Adviſe me my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther —is it ſafe?

'My ſon, no actions can be juſtifiable in the ſight of GOD that are inconſiſtent with his decrees; nor canſt thou prudently undertake to be thy own conductor in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that come under his ſpecial appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ordination—thou haſt hitherto received from him ſpiritual benefits propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably to the trials of thy body and tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of thy mind, all which proceed from the inexhauſted ſource of his eternal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity.</p>

Here ends the prayer of CAIN.</p>
            <p>With eyes intently fixed upon the ground had CAIN hitherto remained, and now looks towards the ſky to ſee his father—he looks, he ſurveys the expanded atmoſphere, he trembles! and with quivering limbs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuſtain nature, down he fell with a groan to the earth—<hi>Adam is gone!</hi> his <hi>comforter!</hi> the <hi>conſolating friend</hi> of the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending penitent has received the ſummons of <hi>Omnipotency</hi> to return to the THRONE of MAJESTY.</p>
            <p>The eyes of CAIN began now to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow and water the ground with grief— the whole frame of nature was in a ſtate of perturbation, and in the agonies of his ſoul would cry out—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="173" facs="unknown:030283_0171_0FE5A330DD4A90D0"/>
'<hi>Heaven is offended! my petition is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected!

            <p>Thus reflections ſucceeded each other as a diſcorded maſs of unſettled imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and terminated inſtantly, before ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination could adjuſt its ſcattered frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and form them into any regularity for hope.</p>

Theſe conſiderations would rejoice him, and inadvertency procure ſome conſolation under the deplorable circumſtances that his oppreſſed imaginations painted unto him—thus he continues bewailing and groaning under his tribulations on the ground, till the cheering warmth of the ſun was much exhilerated, and its power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful influence upon creation viſibly abated; the chilling damps were making their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive motions through the vacuities of the earth rapidly, and the whole atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere loaded with moiſtening dew—theſe combined evils forewarned the mournful complainant of their forcible effects and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching danger, and on his feet he aroſe —flowly, and oppreſſively loaded, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds toward his melancholy abode; as he walks he halts; around him he looks, and looks again; nothing to be perceived but ſolemn ſilence and advancing night; his ſoul was eager for further expoſtulation with itſelf—he ſighed for reconciliation again with God; conſternations ſucceeded each other by quick rotations; and all the
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:030283_0173_0FE5A3326AA37760"/>alleviation he could obtain for his unſettled and diſturbed contemplations, was at times to open his lips with ejaculations to <hi>Heaven</hi> in the language of hope:</p>
            <p>'God is good! God is merciful! CAIN will ſtill reſt upon his God!'</p>
            <p>With faculties thus deranged, medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions diſcompoſed, and a mind roving from circumſtance to circumſtance, forgetfulneſs had ſuffered him to be overtaken with mournful darkneſs, and memory had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken him how to regain his ſolitary reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; thus is CAIN, the firſt-born of mankind, at preſent ſituated, bewildered in a maze of almoſt inſanity; beclouded with the darkneſs of diſmal night and load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mind, and loſt from all conſolating ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
            <p>Thus he traverſes the unbeaten deſart, thoughtleſs of ſafety; but by the hand of Providence was miraculouſly brought to his deſired home; Conviction was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:030283_0174_0FE5A2F644AE1308"/>preſent with him; no deliberation was requiſite at this time to convince him of the goodneſs of God, and with requiſite of heart he cries out—</p>
            <p>'<hi>My God hath not forſaken me!</hi> a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful guide and guardian have I found him through the barren wilderneſs; unto de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair will I bid adieu; melancholy ſhall no longer reſt on the brow of CAIN, for he can again rejoice in the LORD; there are hopes,' he cried, 'I will cheriſh and cultivate them.'</p>
            <p>CAIN was now ſeated in his peaceful bower, ſurrounded with ſable darkneſs, while his ejaculations and contemplative thoughts winged their way to <hi>Heaven</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſedly; when in the midſt of his pious meditations, he hears, at a little diſtance from him, a ſoft and tender voice—</p>
            <p>'CAIN, <hi>be watchful!</hi>' Before ſurpriſe and aſtoniſhment was ſcarce fettled within him, he hears the ſecond voice as a whiſper in his ear—</p>

               <pb n="177" facs="unknown:030283_0175_0FE5A3359AD650C8"/>

            <p>Thus communeth CAIN with himſelf; and after preſenting his offerings of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to <hi>Heaven,</hi> lays himſelf down on the moſſy couch, and preſently falls into a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſlumber; ſleep refreſhed him— his ſoul required a relaxation from its tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent diſquietudes; with the early lark he aroſe, and preſented his morning ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the following language:</p>

            <p>While in this ſituation of doubtful and pleaſing impulſe, a voice entered his ear as follows:</p>

            <p>This cheers and revives his languiſhing ſpirits, and looking up he beheld a conflict in the clouds betwixt two; he was convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that the combatants muſt be advocates for <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Hell;</hi> with bended knees to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

<pb n="184" facs="unknown:030283_0182_0FE5A30181B9A298"/>of <hi>Eternity</hi> will not await thee until the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of men has embraced her child!</hi> Oh, all ye ſhrill voiced warblers, aid me by your muſical inſtructions to celebrate my adorations devoutly; let your morning tributes accelerate my reciprocal adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in ſtrains of unfeigned gratitude, that with calm contentment I may be ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively obedient to the ordinations of my Creator; and all ye the domeſtic com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of my peaceful retreat, who daily awaken my meditations upon infinity, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire me with that native inſtinct that moves you to punctual praiſe, and teach me how to augment our mutual community, and, emulated by your examples, I ſhall not of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend <hi>Heaven;</hi> eſtabliſh the preſent ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fellowſhip amongſt us till the end of time; with CAIN, your ſilent and inarti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate admonitions have been ſeaſonably inſtructive and uſeful, and learned the <hi>aged man</hi> leſſons of morality.'</p>
            <p>Thus reaſons CAIN with himſelf and creation, and from hence enjoyed every
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:030283_0183_0FE5A33F4E2B5D78"/>requiſite happineſs his ſoul needed, or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances required; and piouſly reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his condition, he reaped continual conſolation, and dedicated his hours to the neceſſary duties of life; diligent and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful did he nurture and feed the tender young of his numerous family, and procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the balms of nature's herbage to the infirm and wounded, from the creeping <hi>rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile</hi> to the <hi>majeſtic lion;</hi> every inhabitant of the <hi>grove</hi> to whom that ſpot of creation was friendly, partook of his compaſſionate ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes and cares; in this exerciſe of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to brutes he could reap both rational pleaſure and profit.</p>
            <p>A few ſeaſons had elapſed, and CAIN, in his wonted round through the ſpreading branches and entwinements of the grove, heard a ſound pleaſingly mournful, but plaintively dreadful; all the agitations to which diſcompoſed nature is ſubject, both in joy and ſadneſs, ſeemed to be conjunctively in motion; it ſurpriſed him; patience would
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:030283_0184_0FE5A30615044B78"/>not admit of delay by attention; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds towards the ſpot, guided by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual accents ſoftly whiſpering through the leaves, while the reverberating echo was awful to his ears; he approaches a cloſe ſhade of prickly brambles, nicely join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all around with peculiar exactneſs, and curiouſly interwoven by the artful induſtry of its occupier; one ſmall vacuum only open for the admiſſion of its gueſts. CAIN without heſitation looks within, and his aſtoniſhment ceaſed with pleaſing reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and improved ſenſations, when being convinced of this ſupernatural effect on his mind.</p>
            <p>He ſaw worn out with the ſucceſſive re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of years, and rendered infirm and helpleſs by the decay of age, the once pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, but now <hi>languiſhing Lioneſs:</hi> the laſt remains of lengthened days were diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and around the dying <hi>dam</hi> ſtood the venerable <hi>ſire</hi> and an offspring of tender <hi>cubs,</hi> joining in mournful plaints, while the ſoft accented moans of departing life were
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:030283_0185_0FE5A3415F934850"/>conveyed through the encloſures of the cloſe retreat in ſtrains of ſober melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>CAIN'S appearance produced no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation in this diſconſolate dwelling of ſolemn ſadneſs; his face, his manners, were familiarized to the brute creation; they look on him with irrational reverence, not eſtranged from brutal ſympathy, nor acquainted with human feeling; CAIN with admiration beholds the mournful ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle; <hi>'This equals human affections,'</hi> ſays he, ''tis the hour for ſacred meditation; my ſoul, improve the awful moments! Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold nature undiſguiſed; ſee natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct approaching towards rationality in perfection; can the minds of brutes form ſuch exalted ideas of <hi>death,</hi> which produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to them nonentity and final diſſolution? Let this ſtimulate thee to an extaſy of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion to ſpeculate on <hi>immortality,</hi> and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thy contemplative powers on <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting</hi> felicity, beyond the reach of death and time.'</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="188" facs="unknown:030283_0186_0FE5A307A6966718"/>
The expiring <hi>Lioneſs</hi> opens her eyes and ſees CAIN, LORD of the creation; for ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons paſt ſhe had been accuſtomed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the daily food of his liberal donation in common with all other creatures; ſhe ſhewed not the leaſt emotion of terror at his ſight, but moved her tail for gladneſs; gave one doleful moan, and <hi>expired!</hi> The faithful family attendants, as by inſtinct of nature guided, immediately began to paw the ground, and make an opening to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal with earth and leafs the deceaſed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; while CAIN began to employ his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable faculties upon the various occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of circumſtances around him—</p>
            <p>'The beaſt is dead;' ſays he, ſhe lies as ABEL laid—<hi>breathleſs!</hi>—I will aſſiſt the diligent ſurvivors to diſcharge their debt of <hi>nature</hi> and mine of <hi>duty,</hi> and help to commit the periſhing corpſe to the earth.' Thus ſaid, he joined the haſty labourers, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the obligation that natural feeling ſuggeſted to him. The mournful family afterwards turned tail, and fled further into
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:030283_0187_0FE5A342EDEFE728"/>the wood, and CAIN returned to his own bower, and communeth with himſelf after the following manner:</p>
            <p>'Like the forgotten beaſt ſoon will CAIN the forſaken be! No affectionate wife, no tender parent, no filial child to bewail his expiring moments, or diſcharge the laſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of moral duty to his periſhing frame; here CAIN will die; here CAIN will periſh as a beaſt periſheth, unpitied of all, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numbered with the dead of mankind; <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> I will ſupplicate to go and ſeek EVE, my parent, before the dreadful day ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.'</p>
            <p>Immediately in a ſhort ejaculation he ſupplicates the <hi>Divine Majeſty</hi> for the <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> permiſſion, and betakes him to reſt; and at the dawn of the morrow prepared for his journey.</p>
            <p>The morning was clear, the early birds were ariſen chearfully melodious, and gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety ſpread itſelf on all ſides of him; a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:030283_0188_0FE5A309C75C4700"/>tribe of faithful domeſtics follow him to the opening deſart, which CAIN ſeeing, he exclaims with admiration—'Here is affection irrational! veneration undeſigned! eſteem without guile! the poor creatures regret my departure; by melancholy movements they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me of their ſenſitive ſorrow, and by ſilent motions covet my longer ſtay; I will return and ſooth every one with a <hi>touch.</hi>' He walks back, and not one of the pitiful train attempts to ſhun his approach, or ſhrink from his tender feel; ſuch was the ſubſiſting amity between CAIN and irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creation, that the ſavage verocity of the voracious <hi>tyger</hi> had forſaken him, and the natural timidity peculiar to the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered lineage was now baniſhed from their nice ſenſations, and from ſpray to ſpray did they hop, ſilently and mournfully af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with ſagacious diſcernment, at the loſs of CAIN'S ſociety.</p>
            <p>With deepneſs of thought he pauſes, and wonders at this ſtrange and powerful ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:030283_0189_0FE5A3458725B640"/>on the inſtinctive faculties of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of different natures and properties; and gently ſtroking each noble beaſt, and ſoftly laying the ruffled feathers of the now ſilent ſongſters he bids them adieu, and takes his laſt farewell.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was the face of CAIN turned from them, but a mournful diſcord of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful ſounds reigned throughout the whole herd of beaſts and flocks of birds, and, taking ſeparate courſes and flights, ſlowly move with ſenſitive melancholy, and bid farewell to their departing <hi>monarch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>CAIN now proceeds forwards ruminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the various diſaſters, conveniences, and circumſtances of life that had befallen him ſince the murder of ABEL, and thus begins to reaſon with himſelf—</p>
            <p>Conſcience at times has ſinged me—fear at ſeaſons has been terrifying to me, but reflections on GOD'S <hi>mercy, equity and truth,</hi> have ſupported me—Powerful have
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:030283_0190_0FE5A30B5895B380"/>been Satan's frequent aſſailments, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably liberal have been <hi>Heaven's</hi> merciful protections; and due obedience to the inſtructive leſſons of ABEL and ADAM have taught me temperance in my deſires, and prudence in my conduct; and to the years of aged experience, have all my afflictions of mind been alleviated by the ſeaſonable counſel of improving wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and brought me to the approaching period of <hi>embracing my mother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He now turns round to take his laſt view of the peaceful ſpot, and if <hi>one</hi> faithful do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic of his family was ſtill in ſight, but every one had taken his courſe and depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, like CAIN, from the land of grievous ſolitude.</p>
            <p>'Now,' ſays he, let my footſteps keep pace with the movements of ſwift-winged time—<hi>contemplation</hi> will impede progreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and retard my purſuits after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable meeting—leave me for a while, ye multiplicity of <hi>charming ideas,</hi> that croud
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:030283_0191_0FE5A348F34A91C8"/>promiſcuouſly upon my conceptions, that my ſpeed may bear ſimilitude to the ſwift footed <hi>deer,</hi> and bring me without obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion within ſight of the happy <hi>Eden</hi>—Eaſtward of that beautiful ſpot (adorned with the variegated productions of odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous flowers and herbage, cultivated by the diligent hand of improvement) ſhall I find the mother of men, ſurrounded with a numerous offspring of a later and purer race than CAIN her unfortunate firſt-born—e'er now ſhe has eraſed from recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection the vile miſcreant—while the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid act is ſtill retained in memory, while the bloody remembrance produces bitter anguiſh to her ſoul, when ſhe careſſes with aged affection the fruits of her after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny.'</p>
            <p>Thus communeth CAIN with himſelf, and ſtill proceeds forward without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption or delay, taking his nightly repoſe on the open and untrodden plain, and riſing every morning with the tuneful lark, who
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:030283_0192_0FE5A30FCCAEDB50"/>punctually warned him of approaching day. Protected by <hi>Heaven</hi> and provided by <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> he arrives within ſight of <hi>Eden's Gorden;</hi> to the <hi>eaſt</hi> he bends his courſe, and towards the ſetting ſun at a diſtance, he beholds the <hi>heart-wounding, the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly ſpot! the ſpot where</hi> ABEL <hi>died!</hi> Nature was overcome! CAIN ſunk to the ground! Reflection was too powerful for him to withſtand—darkneſs overtook him before reaſon could be collected, and all the night was devoted to ſupplications to <hi>Heaven</hi> when the intervals of examination would permit his addreſſes to the <hi>Throne of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the morning the diligent warbler gave him timely notice of the riſing ſun, and he proceeded forward; preſently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to his view the graſſy hillock that for a ſeries of years had faithfully withſtood the tempeſts and hurricanes of <hi>diſturbed creation,</hi> and concealed in ſacred ſecurity the harmleſs duſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="unknown:030283_0193_0FE5A34B432F98F8"/>
He ſtops—<hi>anguiſh, ſorrow, grief,</hi> and every reflective concomitant of guilt brings to remembrance, with torturing remorſe the painful ſcene; his mind borders now upon wavering inconſtancy; hope becomes almoſt a victim to deſpair, and ſelf reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches as deep wounds to his ſoul; nothing now could ſupport him but a confidence in GOD; the glory of ABEL and ADAM in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and his encouraging conſolation under their former converſations with him—heavily he proceeds till within ſight of EVE's abode; and ſtill penſively advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, he preſently beholds the venerable <hi>parent</hi> of mankind dandling on her knee with the dalliance of ſmiling gravity, the infant offspring of the <hi>eighth generation</hi>—LAMECH, the firſt-born of METHUSELAH, with a numerous family of chearful and obedient domeſtics around her, all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently employed in the neceſſary occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of fertile induſtry; the pleaſing aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in every countenance was nobly viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſat on every brow with the tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:030283_0194_0FE5A31196DB22A0"/>of joy and delight; contentment had taken up its dwelling amongſt them with ſenſible gratitude, and the bountiful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of <hi>Heaven's</hi> beneficence were por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned out with all their neceſſary conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and uſeful requiſites, untainted with corrupting ſuperfluities to defile them.</p>
            <p>The impreſſion ſuch a ſight made on the mind of CAIN, added to his own reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, would not, for the preſent, admit of a ſerious or unſettled concluſion how to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, which produced the following ſolilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy—</p>
            <p>'My preſence will undoubtedly cauſe confuſion, and probably diſcording opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and unfavourable conjectures in the minds and ſentiments of the <hi>peaceful happy</hi>—'Tis a generation ſtrangers to the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of</hi> CAIN; their knowledge of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate criminal extends not beyond the boundaries of hiſtorical relation of him: and, unacquainted with his many years deep contrition and penitence, can only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:030283_0195_0FE5A34D690910E0"/>in their boſoms an implacable hatred and deteſtation for his memory; for tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition has recorded in the minds of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendants of ADAM the <hi>premeditated,</hi> the <hi>helliſh</hi> deed, that involved CAIN in years of bitter woe; my further approach may be dangerous; overcome by the ſudden impulſe of anger and paſſion at the firſt ſight of CAIN'S infamous MARK, they may, before calm conſideration gives place to patient hearing and reaſon, in one united body be revenged on CAIN for a <hi>brother's death.</hi>'</p>
            <p>In this dubious alternative he petitions <hi>Heaven</hi> for inſtructive leſſons of wiſdom; a voice charmingly ſoft and pleaſing enters his ear—</p>
            <p>'CAIN, <hi>proceed and fear not.</hi> Thus em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolened, he communes with himſelf—</p>
            <p>'Firſt will I approach the <hi>grave of</hi> ABEL, and be eye-witneſs to the devaſtation that
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:030283_0196_0FE5A3132F7DF580"/>revolving time has made on the once green and flouriſhing turf, that entombeth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive purity and primitive ſimplicity; thus ſhall I be prepared by calm and mature reflections to join in converſe and unite in harmony with the righteous family un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known.'</p>
            <p>Thus ſaid he haſtens towards the <hi>grave of</hi> ABEL, and his eyes beheld the fruits of <hi>paternal</hi> and <hi>fraternal</hi> veneration for a <hi>child,</hi> for a <hi>brother</hi>—every odoriferous herb and ſweet ſcented flower to which this cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated ſpot of harmleſs nature was friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, plentifully ſurrounded, with their luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant ſweets, the <hi>tenement of clay,</hi> and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted voluptuouſly their balmy flavours all around—The ſoul of CAIN now ſoars aloft with warm emulation at the affection and love of diſtant generations for the me<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mory of a brother unknown.</p>
            <p>In a poſture of bended humility and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout meditation he fixes his eyes on the <hi>hallowed recluſe,</hi> too intent on the object
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:030283_0197_0FE5A34FA6606AC8"/>of his awakening memory to perceive the playful innocents around him, (the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and grand-children of ENOCH and METHUSELAH) that infantile curioſity and admiration had drawn together to gaze on the unknown ſtranger; when preſently look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>le inoffenſive viſitors, equally ſurpriſed and frightened, run with ſpeed towards their home, to take refuge in the arms of their protecting parents.</p>
            <p>CAIN, ſtill continuing in an uncompoſed ſtate of mind, and his intellectual powers almoſt forſaken him, had not fortitude or reſolution to quit the grave, and in a <hi>few minutes</hi> ſaw approaching him the image of aged <hi>rectitude</hi> and <hi>religion</hi>—EVE the parent of mankind—<hi>the mother of Abel,</hi> leaning on the arm of the <hi>youthful Lamech,</hi> and ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the other ſide with the cloſe embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of her children's children, clinging their little hands with terrific imaginations to her covering garments.</p>
            <p>CAIN ſaw and knew his mother, ere ſhe
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:030283_0198_0FE5A358DEEADF08"/>was near him—' '<hi>Tis my mother!</hi> he cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and down he fell with his face on the grave.</p>
            <p>The aged parent draws near, and with ſympathy commiſerates the unhappy ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger—in vain ſhe ſtrives for a time to ſoothe him with the language of <hi>pity</hi> and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Heaven,'</hi> ſaid ſhe, 'has directed the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering footſteps of the unfortunate to the manſions of reflective ſorrow; ſee how he lies with pulſes beating irregular courſes on the turf of <hi>ſilent darkneſs.</hi> Ariſe, thou diſtreſſed; partake of the bounties of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's liberality; behold EVE the ancient of living, the mother of men, prepared to adminiſter the needful conſolation and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort unto thee; let her aſſiſt thee with the ſoft endearments of tenderneſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; embrace her friendly offers for thy intereſt, moved towards thee only by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of mutual ſenſation; afflict not thyſelf with unlimited grief, nor permit anxiety to

            <p>LAMECH now gently touches CAIN, and opens his mouth to him as follows:</p>
            <p>'Oh, thou dejected! o'ercome with the weight of affliction and troubled mind, <hi>Who art thou? ariſe!</hi> be not deaf to the intreaties of ſage experience; no harm a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waits thee amongſt the deſcendants of EVE; look up and behold the countenance of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable affection, revered by a numerous offspring; the heart of our <hi>univenſal pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent</hi> beats with mournful breathings for the alleviation of thy diſtreſs.'</p>
            <p>CAIN now lifts up his eyes and beholds the <hi>chearful, painful</hi> ſmile of compaſſionate feeling in the face of his feeble parent, and immediately aroſe and cries out;</p>
            <p>'<hi>My mother! my mother! my mother! Eve my parent!</hi> behold CAIN the long loſt firſt-born of thy womb! behold the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

               <hi>Penitent;</hi> the <hi>ſorrowful convert;</hi> look in the face of CAIN, and doubts will fly thy breaſt; ſee the immoveable STIGMA of GOD: <hi>Art thou now convinced, my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>''Tis my child!' cries EVE, <hi>embracing him,</hi> and with joy and infirmities of years, ſinks to the ground; CAIN aſſiſted E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOCH, the father of METHUSELAH, to raiſe her from the earth, but her overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faculties of gladneſs, rendered her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of uttering the joyful language of her ſoul. Slowly they proceed towards the fragrant, the delightful abode of EVE, and procuring the neceſſary cordials and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing juices, ſhe recovered her ſpirits and began to commune with her <hi>ſon; her firſt-born long loſt child!</hi> while a large fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of each ſex and all ages, ſome of each tribe from SETH to LAMECH, ſurrounded them with ſober attention, and liſtened with pleaſing ſatisfaction to the edifying diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="unknown:030283_0201_0FE5A360F6704398"/>
EVE thus began—'How have the days of the years of my ſon been ſpent? Has the LORD been <hi>in</hi> and <hi>out</hi> with thee, my ſon? Is the ſoul of my firſt-born re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by any encouraging conſolation from his GOD? Is the violence of all unruly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders baniſhed from the breaſt of the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of men? Has CAIN reſiſted all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to ſin in the interval of long paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal abſence? And is he returned to cloſe the eyes of his aged mother in <hi>peace?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here CAIN relates to his mother the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious occurrences and circumſtances that had befallen him in the courſe of his ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment from EDEN'S view, which produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in EVE different ſenſations of emotion, as his hiſtorical relation affected her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, and as the ſucceſſive rotation of events that had accompanied his <hi>ſolitary</hi> as well as <hi>buſy</hi> life impreſſed upon her reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but the narration of ABEL'S and ADAM'S appearing to him, revived her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſoul with extaſy of joy, and produced raptures of unbounded gratitude and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="204" facs="unknown:030283_0202_0FE5A36288E3D548"/>
Here the tears of contemplative powers burſt their vent through the weakly eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid, and moiſtened the cheeks of CAIN with affectionate embraces of aged triumph and joy.</p>

            <p>Daily did CAIN take his thoughtful rounds amongſt the cultivated encloſures of his ſociable and beloved companions: tranquility had taken up her reſting place in his ſoul, and with his aged mother could enjoy, under the bloſſoming branches of ſhady arbours, the exhaling ſweets of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riegated flowers, and join in concord the muſical and mellifluous harmony of the warbling inhabitants: punctually would he go, and pay a penſive and reflective vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit to the grave of ABEL; theſe occaſions made tranſgreſſion painful to his memory while conſolation was elevated within him by contemplating upon <hi>Heaven's</hi> many

            <p>'My ſon, the language of thy lips is comfortable; the words of thy mouth are reving; with calm reſignation could EVE now render up her ſoul unto God; with peaceful tranquility could ſhe ſurrender all nature's perfections into the hands of its

            <p>After this manner diſcourſed EVE with CAIN, both ſeated on the conſecrated turf of ABEL, and CAIN perceived a faultering in her ſpeech; a ſudden emotion in her limbs that ſeemed to predict an immovea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble calamity; the melancholy cataſtrophe was near at hand that was to ſeparate pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from child and children; the diffolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mortality was evinced by approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſymptoms of meagre death; the pale, the wan viſage was apparent in her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and age and nature ſeemed joint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly combined to take a farewell of mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity together; the mother of ABEL ſinks on the boſom of CAIN; the ſcene is now become awfully mournful! the young and the youthful cry out,</p>

            <p>On all ſides did reverence and eſteem unite to fill up the meaſure of his days with undiſturbed and unmoleſted peace; and from the circumſtances of revolutions elapſed and reflections on the paſt and approaching viciſſitude near at hand, he required all the ſolacing conſolation that his faithful fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily could render him to ſupport him under thoſe frequent recollections of occurrences that required his utmoſt fortitude to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount, and from whence no alleviation could be derived but by confidence in his GOD, and improvement of <hi>ſtying</hi> time by holy converſation—attended by the young and innocent he compaſſes the cultivated incloſures with the ſmiles of aged pleaſure, and partakes of the harmleſs amuſements of the children with chearful gravity.</p>

            <p>'CAIN,' ſays the <hi>mother of Methuſelah</hi> 'What grief of mind oppreſſes thy riper meditations?

            <p>ADAM and EVE had recorded the mournful day of ABEL'S death, and reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame to ſucceeding poſterity—on this <hi>ſame day,</hi> after revolving centuries and ſucceſſive generations, did the venerable wanderer, <hi>weak and feeble,</hi> unknown to
