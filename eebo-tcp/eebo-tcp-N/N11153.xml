            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>NEHEMIAH, vi. 8, 9.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>Then I ſent unto him, ſaying, There are no ſuch things done as thou ſayeſt, but thou feigneſt them out of thine own heart. For they all made us afraid, ſaying, Their hands ſhall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O God, ſtrengthen my hands.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>NEHEMIAH, whoſe name this book bears, and who was now advanced to the government of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was a very religious and moſt excellent man, and remarkably raiſed up by God, and peculiarly qualified for that eminent ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The temper and conduct of a diſintereſted pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot, a true lover of his country, and of a wiſe, vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant and upright ruler and magiſtrate, appears conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous in his example, and through all parts of his public adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>HE was ſent to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> out of his captivity by <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> the King, (to whom he had been cup-bearer) in the twentieth year of his reign. The office of cup-bearer was a place of great honor and advantage in the Perſian court, becauſe of the privilege it gave him of being ſo much in the King's preſence, and the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity he had thereby of gaining his favor, for the obtaining any petition which he ſhould make to him, and the promoting his own intereſt. The <hi>Artaxerxes</hi> here mentioned is but another name for <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:014124_0003_0F930200370A31D8"/>
who married <hi>Eſther</hi> a Jewiſh captive, and made her his queen, after repudiating <hi>Vaſhti.</hi> And probably it was by the favour of queen <hi>Eſther,</hi> as being of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and people with her, that he obtained ſo honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and advantageous a preferment in that court.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, neither the honor and advantage of the place, nor the long ſettlement of his family out of his country, could make him forget his love for it, or lay aſide that zeal which he had for the religion of his forefathers who had formerly dwelt in it. For though he had been born and bred in a ſtrange land; yet he had a great love for <hi>Zion,</hi> and was heartily engaged to exert himſelf for the proſperity of it, and was in all things a very religious obſerver of the law of God. And therefore, when ſome came from <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and told him of the ill ſtate of that city, how the wall of it was broken down, and the gates of it in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moliſhed ſtate as when burnt with fire by the <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> and that by reaſon hereof the remnant of the captivity that dwelt there lay open, not only to the incurſions and inſults of their enemies, but alſo to the reproach and contempt of their neighbours, as a weak and deſpicable people; and that they were in both theſe reſpects in great affliction and grief of heart; the good man being ſuitably moved with this repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, applied himſelf in faſting and prayer unto the Lord his God, and earneſtly made ſupplication to him for Iſrael his people, and for the place which he had choſen for his worſhip among them. And having thus implored the divine mercy againſt this evil, he reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed next to make his application to the King for the redreſſing of it, truſting in God for the inclining of his heart thereto: and therefore when his turn came next to wait in his office, the King obſerving his countenance to be ſad, which had not been ſo before in his preſence, ſays to him, "<hi>Why is thy countenance ſad, ſeeing thou art not ſick? this is nothing elſe but ſorrow of heart." "Then</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:014124_0004_0F930200DF6BF200"/>
(ſays Nehemiah) <hi>I was ſore afraid, and ſaid unto the King, Let the King live forever. Why ſhould not my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance be ſad, when the city, the place of my fathers ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres, lieth waſte, and the gates thereof are conſumed with fire?</hi>" He took this opportunity to lay before him the diſtreſſed ſtate of his country; and owning this to be a cauſe of great grief and ſadneſs to him, he prayed the King to ſend him thither to remedy it: and by the favour of Queen <hi>Eſther</hi> (it ſeems) he had his petition granted him; for it being particularly remarked in the ſacred text, that the Queen was ſitting by the King when <hi>Nehemiah</hi> obtained the grant, it ſufficiently inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates that her favour was aſſiſting to him herein. And accordingly a royal decree was iſſued out for rebuilding the walls and gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was ſent thither with it, as governor of the province of <hi>Judea,</hi> to put it in execution. And for his greater honor and ſecurity, the King ſent a guard of horſe, under the command of ſome of the captains of his army, to eſcort him to his government. And he wrote letters to all the governors on this ſide the river <hi>Euphrates,</hi> to further him in the work on which he was ſent; and alſo gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to <hi>Aſaph</hi> the keeper of his foreſts in thoſe parts, to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him ſo much timber out of them, as ſhould be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the finiſhing of it. However, the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> the <hi>Moabites</hi> and the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and other neighbouring nations round, did all they could to obſtruct his deſign and defeat his enterpriſe. And to this they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, not only by the antient and bitter enmity which thoſe people bore to the whole <hi>Jewiſh</hi> nation, becauſe of the different manners and different religions they were of; but moſt eſpecially at this time, becauſe of their lands and property: for during the time that the <hi>Jews</hi> were in captivity, theſe nations having ſeized their lands and the intereſt they had left in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, would be forced to reſtore and refund them, upon the re-eſtabliſhment and proſperity of the <hi>Jews</hi> there.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014124_0005_0F930201B9F21370"/>
For which reaſon they did all they could to oppoſe their re-ſettlement: hoping that if they could be kept low, or quite depreſſed, they might retain the prey they were in danger of looſing, and regain any which they had already loſt.</p>
            <p>BUT <hi>Nehemiah</hi> was not at all diſcouraged hereat, but put his truſt in heaven, and made his prayer to the God of his Salvation. And having on his arrival at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> made known to the people the commiſſion with which he was ſent, he took a view of the ruins of the old walls, and immediately began to repair them. And the work was carried on with amazing rapidity and ſucceſs, notwithſtanding all manner of oppoſition was made againſt him both from within, and from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. For from within ſeveral falſe prophets and other treacherous perſons, under the influence of a wicked heart, ſet agoing by the force of bribery and corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, endeavoured to create him obſtructions; and, from without, <hi>Sanballat,</hi> the <hi>Horonite, Tobiah</hi> the <hi>Ammorite, Geſhem</hi> the <hi>Arabian,</hi> and others, gave him all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance they were able, not only by underhand deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and treacherous tricks and contrivances, but alſo by open force; ſo that while part of the people labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in carrying on the building, the other part ſtood to their arms to defend them againſt the aſſaults of ſuch as had deſigns againſt them. And all had their arms at hand even while they worked, to be ready at a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal given, to draw together at any part where the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhould be diſcovered coming upon them. And by this means, through the divine bleſſing, they ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves againſt all the attempts and deſigns of their enemies, till the work was nearly brought to a concluſion, to their own great joy, and the extreme mortification of their adverſaries. Then <hi>Sanballat, Tobiah</hi> and <hi>Geſhem,</hi> ſent to <hi>Nehemiah</hi> to come along with them into the field, (as it ſeems under a pretence) that there they might enter into an alliance together, and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014124_0006_0F930202C8931950"/>
ſwear inviolable friendſhip to each other: but <hi>Nehemiah</hi> perceived that this was only a ſtratagem to ſurprize him, and do him ſome violence. He therefore ſent word that he was engaged in a great work which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired his conſtant attendance, and which he could not intermit upon any account. They ſent him the ſame invitation four times over, and he as often returned the ſame anſwer. At laſt <hi>Sanballat</hi> wrote to him in terms of the following purport, <q>There is a report ſpread among the people, and <hi>Gaſhmu</hi> (which is the ſame with <hi>Geſhem,</hi> only differently ſpelt) confidently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it, that you and the Jews intend a revolt—that your deſign in rebuilding the walls of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is to declare yourſelf King of the <hi>Jews</hi>—that with this view have ſuborned prophets to ſuggeſt to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that you ought to be the King of the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Now as all theſe things are to be repreſented to the King, it will be convenient for you to give us a meeting, that we may confer together about them.</q> But inſtead of going to them himſelf, he ſends this ſhort and cutting anſwer to all his inſidious inſinuations and lying ſlanders, "<hi>There are no ſuch things done as thou ſayeſt, but thou feigneſt them out of thine own heart,</hi>" they are all of your own invention, and have nothing of truth in them. And while he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents their enemies as endeavouring to intimidate them, and plotting obſtructions to the work, he piouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes himſelf to God, in prayer, for perſevering and increaſing fortitude;—while their enemies endeavour to weaken their hands from the work, he dutifully looks to God to ſtrengthen them. "<hi>For</hi> (ſays he) <hi>they all made us afraid,</hi> (i. e. did all they could to intimidate us) <hi>ſaying their hands ſhall be weakened from the work that it be not done. Now, therefore, O God, ſtrengthen my hands.</hi>

            <p>I. THAT wicked and intriguing men ſometimes make uſe of the fictions and falſhoods of their own hearts to hinder the lawful and laudable enterprizes of a people, and obſtruct their proſperity.</p>
            <p>THE corrupt hearts of fallen mankind, when not reſtrained or ſanctified by the grace of God, are capable of being influenced to any meaſures or means, however wicked and guilty, and how much ſoever they finally tend to the real infamy and wretchedneſs of themſelves, or the hurt and injury of others. Pride is naturally a predominant ſinful luſt in them, and therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence and ſuperiority a very ruling paſſion: and to gratify their guilty pride and ambition, they ſtick at no meaſures, lawful or unlawful in themſelves; but ruſh through, right or wrong, and make uſe of truth or falſhood, juſt as their vain minds imagine will make moſt for their purpoſes. To theſe ſinful luſts and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities are owing all the wars and fightings that have ever been known among mankind, and all the blood unjuſtly ſhed from the death of righteous <hi>Abel,</hi> to the laſt ſufferer, murdered by the hand of cruelty and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. To oppreſs others and exalt themſelves, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh the deſigns of <hi>deſpotic</hi> ſway, all their inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is put to the ſtretch, all their efforts uſed to frame and execute plans and ſchemes of deceit, plots of ſlaviſh

ſubjection to their caprice; and all the arts of lying in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, and force of lawleſs power are called to their aid, and every ſcene of violence, rapine, and murder is acted over.</p>
            <p>SANBALLAT the chief or governor of the <hi>Hittites</hi> or <hi>Samaritans</hi> was always a great enemy to the <hi>Jews.</hi> He was a native of <hi>Horon,</hi> or <hi>Horonius,</hi> a city beyond <hi>Jordon,</hi> in the country of the <hi>Moabites</hi> When <hi>Nehemiah</hi> firſt came and began to build the walls of Jeruſalem, <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballat, Tobiah,</hi> and <hi>Geſhem</hi> made themſelves ſport with him, and affected to treat the matter with ridicule and contempt, and ſent to him and the <hi>Jews</hi> who were with him to know upon what authority he undertook this enterprize, and whether this was not a revolt or rebellion againſt the King. But <hi>Nehemiah</hi> anſwered "<hi>it is the God of Heaven that aſſiſts us, we are his ſervants, but ye have no portion, nor right nor memorial in Jeruſalem.</hi>" And ſuch was their envy and malice, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all their pretended ridicule and ſcorn! The ſacred hiſtory informs us "<hi>it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to ſeek the welfare of the children of Iſrael.</hi>" But as <hi>Nehemiah</hi> proceeded with vigor in his undertaking, and as <hi>Sanballat</hi> heard (ſays the ſacred hiſtorian) "<hi>that we builded the wall, he was wroth and took great indignation and mocked the Jews. And he ſpake before his brethren and the army of Smaria, and ſaid, what do theſe feeble Jews? will they fortify themſelves? will they ſacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the ſtones out of the heaps of the rubbiſh which are burned? Now Tobiah the Amonite was by him, and he ſaid, even that which they build, if a fox go up, he ſhall even break down their ſtone wall.</hi>" But this method of ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful treatment and reproach not anſwering the deſign in diſcouraging the <hi>Jews,</hi> and they proceeding with engagedneſs and perſeverance in their undertaking, and having nearly compleated the work, "<hi>it came to paſs that when Samballat and Tobiah, and the Arabians,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014124_0009_0F930204AC3C8620"/>
Ammonites, and the Aſhdodites heard that the walls of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem were made up and that the breaches began to be ſtopped, then they were very wroth, and conſpired all of them together to come and to fight againſt Jeruſalem, and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</hi>" But their attempts to injure and oppreſs the people, and put an end to their enterprize, by open violence and force, proving abortive, they then recur to the moſt wicked, deceitful, and malicious fictions and ſtratagems, to accompliſh their deſigns.</p>
            <p>IN the firſt place they endeavour to decoy <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> into their power, under feigned pretenſions of real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and friendſhip for him; and for this end repeat their invitation to him four times, thinking to do him miſchief; but he being apprized of their miſchevious plot as often excuſed himſelf from meeting them, on account of the greatneſs and importance of the work he was engaged in.</p>
            <p>THEN <hi>Sanballat</hi> ſent his ſervant to him the fifth time with an open letter in his hand; the letter was ſent open, doubtleſs on purpoſe to let any ſee or hear it, diſcretionarily, whom it might probably influence into their evil meaſures; or in order to unhinge and terrify the minds of the people, and, by tampering with them, weaken the hands of <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> The purport of the letter was that he and the people deſigned to rebel, and make <hi>him</hi> king; and that to pave the way for this, he had appointed prophets to preach of himſelf at <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> ſaying, there is a king in <hi>Judah;</hi> and now ſhall it be reported to the king according to theſe words. Come now therefore let us take council toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther! He intended, and no doubt expected that this letter, if it had no other effect, yet ſhould bring on an interview between them, in which he might do him a miſchief. The notice which <hi>Nehemiah</hi> took and the improvement he made of it we have in the text. "<hi>Then I ſent unto him, ſaying, there are no ſuch things done as thou ſayeſt, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014124_0010_0F9302055B87B2F0"/>
For they all made us afraid, ſaying, their hands ſhall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. New there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, O God, ſtrengthen my hands.</hi>" He was next attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a certain falſe prophet named <hi>Shemaiah,</hi> whom <hi>Sanballat</hi> and <hi>Tobiah</hi> had gained over to their intereſt and hired for the purpoſe, and who would have intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated him, adviſing him to ſhut himſelf up in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to prevent any attempt upon his life; but <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> by his great prudence avoided falling into the ſnare; and in his treatment of this inſidious falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet he diſcovers the moſt delicate ſenſe of true honor, and gives the moſt ſignal proof of true courage and bravery. Hear his own account of the matter. "<hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward I came unto the houſe of Shemaiah the ſon of Delaiah, the ſon of Mahetabell who was ſhut up; and he ſaid let us meet together in the houſe of God, within the temple, and let us ſhut the doors of the temple; for they will come to ſlay thee; yea, in the night will they come to ſlay thee. And I ſaid ſhould ſuch a man as I flee? And who is there that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as I am, would go into the temple to ſave his life? I will not go in. And lo I perceived that God had not ſent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy againſt me; for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him. Therefore was he hired, that I ſhould be afraid, and do ſo and ſin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me. My</hi> GOD <hi>think thou of Tobiah and Sanballat according to theſe their works, and on the propheteſs Noadiah, and the reſt of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is very common, as in the account now read, for wicked and intriguing men, out of pure malice and fiction to charge thoſe crimes and faults upon others, which they themſelves only are guilty of. Thus theſe ſame men who had accuſed <hi>Nehemiah</hi> of ſuborning pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets to preach him up for a king, without foundation, had themſelves roundly bribed others to prophecy falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt him and uſe all their influence to intimidate him and hinder the good work in which he was engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014124_0011_0F9302061A8ADC60"/>
But the work was of <hi>God,</hi> and was therefore ſoon completed notwithſtanding all their malicious oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. "<hi>And it came to paſs</hi> (ſays the ſacred hiſtorian) <hi>that when all our enemies heard thereof, and all the heathen that were about us ſaw theſe things they were much caſt down in their own eyes! for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</hi>" And thus always ſhall the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of God and his people ſooner or later find all their wicked and hurtful ſchemes and efforts againſt them defeated to their own intire ſhame and debaſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>ONE method of intriguing againſt and oppoſing the rebuilding <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> under the adminiſtration of <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> and keeping the body of the <hi>Jews</hi> in a ſtate of ſlaviſh ſubjection and oppreſſion is yet to be mentioned according to the account we have of it in the end of the chapter containing the text; and that is, <hi>abuſive and injurious letter-writing.</hi> The ſacred hiſtorian men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions it in the following words: "<hi>Moreover in thoſe days the nobles of Judah ſent many letters unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them. For there were many in Judah ſworn unto him, becauſe he was the ſon-in law of Sheckaniah the ſon of Arah; and his ſon Johanan had tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the daughter of Meſhullam the ſon of Berekiah. Alſo they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah ſent letters to put me in fear.</hi>" This <hi>Tobiah</hi> was an <hi>Ammonite,</hi> and an inveterate enemy to the <hi>Jews;</hi> and was of great conſideration in the law of the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> of which he was governor with <hi>Sanbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lat.</hi> He married the daughter of <hi>Shechaniah</hi> one of the principal <hi>Jews</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and by his own and his ſon's marriage and family connections there, had a powerful party in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> itſelf, which were oppoſite to that of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and to the true intereſt of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> nation. But this prudent governor by his wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, moderation and perſeverance, defeated all their machinations, though they carried on a moſt crafty
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014124_0012_0F930206D8E65808"/>
and intriguing correſpondence by letters, with their own party, in which the good deeds of <hi>Tobiah</hi> were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled and reported to <hi>Nehemiah;</hi> and by the ſame par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty the words of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> were ſent back to him, and all in order to gain him over to the intereſt of their party; and <hi>Tobiah</hi> himſelf wrote letters directly to him to put him in fear, and intimidate him into their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; but to his immortal honor he was proof againſt all their practices of intrigue and corruption, and his name remains forever embalmed in the providence of <hi>God,</hi> as a moſt renowned patriot, and deliverer of his country.</p>
            <p>A COPY of a letter wrote to the king by the crafty intriguing enemies of the <hi>Jews</hi> we have at large in the fourth chapter of <hi>Ezra</hi> beginning at the eleventh verſe. <hi>This</hi> is <hi>the copy of the letter that they ſent unto him,</hi> even <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Artaxerxes the king, Thy ſervants the men on this ſide the river, and at ſuch a time. Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from thee to us, are come unto Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, building the rebellious and the bad city, and have ſet up the walls</hi> there of, <hi>and joined the foundations. Be it known now unto the king, that if this city be builded, and the walls ſet up</hi> again, then <hi>will they not pay toll, tribute, and cuſtom, and</hi> ſo <hi>thou ſhalt endamage the revenue of the kings. Now becauſe we have maintenance from</hi> the kings <hi>palace, and it was not meet for us to ſee the kings diſhonour: therefore have we ſent and certified the king, That ſearch may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers: ſo ſhalt thou find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto kings and provinces, &amp; that they have moved ſedition within the fame of old time: for which cauſe was this city deſtroyed. We certifie the king, that if this city be builded</hi> again, <hi>and the walls thereof ſet up, by this means thou ſhalt have no portion on this ſide the river.</hi> This letter contains the genuine ſpirit of ſelf intereſted placemen and deſigning courtiers, and is full of ſervile adulation and flattery to the king, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended

            <p>AND it had ſuch an effect, through the permiſſion of divine providence, as to induce the king to ſend his expreſs command that the purpoſe of the letter ſhould be carried into execution: and the letter-writers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their companions had orders to ſee this done, which doubtleſs they undertook with a malicious kind of pleaſure: and the ſacred text ſays, "<hi>they went up in haſte to Jeruſalem unto the Jews, and made them to ceaſe by force and power.

The work the <hi>Jews</hi> were engaged in was a lawful and laudable work, for the religious and civil intereſt of their nation and country; and thoſe who oppoſed them were guilty of great wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs; and though God's profeſſing people of Iſrael highly deſerved, on account of their own ſins, much more than they met with, as coming from the hand of a righteous God, yet they deſerved not ſuch treatment from their fellowmen. Neither are the ill deſerts of the <hi>Jews</hi> at the hand of God, any juſtification of their enemies in their evil deſigns againſt them, nor do they make them e'er the leſs guilty in the ſight of heaven.</p>
            <p>THE infinitely wiſe and good God, makes uſe of wicked men as he pleaſes, to anſwer his divine pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, and often taketh the wiſe ones of this world in their own craftineſs; and over rules all their deſigns and conduct for his own glory, and the good of his people <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

upon all the impenitents, for all the deſigns and efforts of their malice and wickedneſs, whether carried on in a more <hi>ſecret, confidential,</hi> and underhand intriguing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or managed by more open force and violence.</p>
            <p>AND thus there have been and ſtill are wicked and intriguing men in the world, that make uſe of the fictions and falſhoods of their own hearts to hinder the lawful and laudable enterpriſes of a people, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their proſperity.</p>
            <p>And we go on to obſerve,</p>
            <p>II. THAT it is the duty of a people who are thus falſely and wickedly dealt with by their enemies, for their intimidation and hurt, to look to God by prayers to ſtrengthen their hands, to grant them the fortitude and wiſdom they need to counteract and baffle the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidious and malicious deſigns of their enemies.</p>
            <p>To this duty good <hi>Nehemiah</hi> the people under his government, when thus attacked by their perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enemies: "<hi>Now therefore, O God, ſtrengthen my hands.</hi>" Every good and perfect gift cometh from God; ſtrength of body and ſoundneſs of mind, the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of one's own ſoul, courage, bravery, and forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, all manly and uſeful efforts and enterpriſes, all exertions and all ſucceſs intirely depend upon, and are derived from him in whom we live and move and have our being. His favour is life, and his loving kindneſs is better than life; and bleſſed and happy is that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whoſe God is the Lord." And it is the peculiar privilege of the viſible covenant and profeſſing people of God, when their enemies riſe up againſt them and plot and ſeek their hurt, in any way whatever, that they have ſuch direction and encouragement, humbly to look to God by prayer for all the help and ſalvation they need, for deliverance from, or victory over their enemies.

Their enemies are often very crafty and powerful, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues ſecret, their plots deep laid and full of ſerpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine ſubtlety, and ſuch (as far as creatures are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) as promiſe and inſure ſucceſs: but Almighty God with infinite eaſe can turn all their counſels into fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs, cauſe all their devices to iſſue in their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and the evil they meant againſt others to recoil upon their own heads. They may uſe all the arts of intimidation, but all ſhall be in vain, if God encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages the hearts and ſtrengthens the hands of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and it is equally the duty and ſecurity of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to look to him and depend upon him to encourage their hearts and ſtrengthen their hands. At his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign pleaſure, "five ſhall chace an hundred, and an hundred put ten thouſand to flight." The hearts of all men are in his hand, and he inſpires them with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and courage; or fills them with terror or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may; and ſucceeds or blaſts their deſigns as he pleaſes; and he can "ſave with few as well as with many." And a people who ſeek to him, and put their truſt and confidence in him, are always ſafe and ſecure under his Almighty protection, and ſhall have their hearts encouraged and their hands ſtrengthened, and their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies ſhall be made to flee or fall before them. And theſe are the directions of the word of God, <hi>Offer unto God thankſgiving, and pay thy vows unto the Moſt High; and call upon me in the day of trouble.

"Wait on the Lord: be of good courage and he ſhall ſtrengthen thine heart: wait, I ſay on the Lord.</hi>" And ſuch were the many remarkable interpoſitions of divine providence in favour of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient people, and ſuch their ſafety under the Almighty protection, that <hi>Moſes</hi> but a little before his death thus <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

And while the <hi>Dignitaries</hi> of the <hi>Engliſh Church</hi> in their places as members of parliament, are known, with one or two exceptions only, to be under the influence of a corrupt adminiſtration, and particularly to have paſſed the <hi>Quebec Bill,</hi> and been in all the ſecret acts againſt the colonies; and while thoſe who conform to them on this, or the other ſide of the water, and affect, contrary to the ſimplicity of the goſpel of Chriſt, to ſtile them their ſuperiors, exert themſelves to ſupport every tyrannical and arbitrary meaſure, they are careſſed as <hi>friends of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> while clergymen of different principles &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, of whatever church or particular chriſtian profeſſion they be, who converſe upon and preach up as occaſion requires, the duties, the privileges, and liberty of the goſpel, and the friendly aſpect it has upon the civil rights and happineſs of mankind, and dare not attempt to preſs the religion taught by the PRINCE OF PEACE AND MOST BENEVOLENT SAVIOUR OF MEN, into the ſervice of <hi>tyranny</hi> and <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> and who ſhew to the people the privileges and rights which they enjoy by divine revelation; and how they ought to improve them, ſo as to anſwer their duty and find their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, are called <hi>fanatical courting preachers, incendiaries, independents, enemies to government and order,</hi> and what not, and are marked out as objects deſerving the ſevereſt chaſtiſement.

and operative then, and thoſe that pretended to be <hi>friends of government,</hi> and to ſupport the prerogatives of the crown, were guilty of the vileſt aſperſions towards the patriots of their country and friends of the people, and hired and bribed ſome prieſts and prophets to preach and prophecy in ſupport of their meaſures, and againſt the true intereſt of the people, and were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves groſly guilty of the like crimes which they wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and wickedly charged againſt <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and of which he was altogether innocent. He exhorted and encouraged and commanded his prieſts to do their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty faithfully according to the law of God, and thus doing is offence enough againſt tyrannical and wicked men. Shall a whole bench of <hi>proteſtant biſhops,</hi> by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and oath, peculiarly bound to ſupport and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend the <hi>proteſtant</hi> religion, and guard againſt the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of popery, uſher into the world a <hi>bantling</hi> under their patronage and authority, which ſo ſtrongly bears the features of the <hi>ſcarlet whore and mother of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots?</hi> And are we not pardonable, nay are we not in duty bound, to hold up the <hi>miſ ſhapen brat</hi> to view, and warn the people againſt ſuch advances towards <hi>popery,</hi> that ſuperſtitious and bloody religion and yoke of ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very which neither we nor our fathers were able to bear; and againſt which their <hi>own order and predeceſſors,</hi> being ſome of them the brighteſt ornaments and lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries of the chriſtian church, have heretofore born a noble teſtimony, and made a moſt memorable ſtand, and reſiſted even unto death, not counting their own lives dear, if they might but be found faithful unto death, and finiſh their courſe with joy!</p>
               <p>WE envy them not their worldly dignities and emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luments. We claim nothing at their hands but the free and peaceable enjoyment of the rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges which the providence of God hath mercifully fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured us with, and which have been guaranteed and ſecured to us, and left us unmoleſted by former <hi>Britiſh</hi>

kings and parliaments; and which, in this country, were firſt purchaſed, and have ſince been maintained, at the hazard and expence of the beſt blood and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of our <hi>anceſtors</hi> the firſt ſettlers, and their <hi>poſterity</hi> after them.</p>
               <p>IT is now a day of peculiar trial, and every good man and lover of his country, under the preſent aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects of divine providence, and the political and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial movements that have taken place, muſt feel a very ſenſible degree of affecting apprehenſion and concern, and the man ought to be pitied for his <hi>weakneſs,</hi> or ſhunned for his <hi>wickedneſs,</hi> at the preſent day, "<hi>whoſe boſom beats not in his country's cauſe.</hi>"</p>
               <p>WE have no other new world on earth to explore, or flee to, for an <hi>aſylum,</hi> from the hand of tyranny and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Here we muſt ſtand or fall. Matters have grown to the moſt alarming criſis. We have no other <hi>alternative</hi> left us, but to ſubmit without conditions, to all the demands of unjuſtly uſurped and exorbitant power; or paſſively be knocked on the head and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed in death; or make a noble, united and vigorous and virtuous oppoſition. That the <hi>laſt</hi> is ſo univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the reſolution of the country, is matter of joy and thankfulneſs and an omen for good. How willingly do men offer themſelves in the ſervice, and what bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and engagedneſs have our countrymen ſhewn in the good cauſe? And though the deſolations of a civil war have commenced, and the blood of the ſlain, once and again, ran in our ſtreets; and fire and ſword been permitted to make their ravages and devaſtations; yet is not the providence of God moſt thankfully to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that ſo little deſtruction hath been made amongſt the proper inhabitants of the land, and noble defenders of the country, in compariſon to what our enemies have ſuffered?</p>
               <p>A HUMAN and chriſtian mind will be inclined to drop a tear over our ſlaughtered enemies, eſpecially the

poor ſoldiery, forced on by ſuperior command to the infamous and bloody work, in which ſucceſs would be equally diſgraceful to them as a defeat. For officers, conſidered as men of ſenſe and reading, acquainted with the <hi>Britiſh</hi> hiſtory, and conſtitution, though they are deſervedly the objects of pity, yet their conduct ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of no ſhadow of excuſe. While our brave coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen in all their dutiful exertions and lawful enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes for the ſalvation of their country, while they live, will live honored, and when they die, die la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, their graves watered with their country's tears! and their names be had in everlaſting remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance; <hi>but the memory of the wicked ſhall rot.</hi> O! that as a people from the higheſt to the loweſt amongſt us, we might have the humble heart, joined with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of prayer, confidence and fortitude, which <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and we truſt others, in his day had; and that we might unite through this wide extended <hi>continent</hi> in this cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and alarming day, when every art is uſed to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midate, oppreſs and break us to ſervile purpoſes; and under a due ſenſe of our dependence upon God, and the need we have of <hi>his</hi> favour and bleſſing, have our hearts and language thoroughly conformed to the prayer in the text, <hi>Now, therefore, O God, ſtrengthen our hands.</hi> And we ſhall do well to attend to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection he gave the people then, as very applicable to ourſelves now, <hi>Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord which is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your ſons and your daughters, your wives and your houſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>GOD in his merciful providence is waiting to be gracious to us. HE hath already many a time, <hi>done great things for us, whereof we are glad.</hi> He is infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ready, and able to ſave us out of all our troubles, and nothing prevents needed ſalvation but our ſins and iniquities;—theſe alone ſeperate between us and our God and hide his face from us. It becomes us deeply to humble ourſelves under <hi>his</hi> mighty hand,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:014124_0023_0F930212E14C3738"/>
and aſcribe righteouſneſs to our Maker. He is infinitely juſt and holy, and there is a wonderful mixture of goodneſs and mercy in all his judgments which are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. He puniſhes us far leſs than we deſerve, and many tokens for good are very obſervable in his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential dealings and diſpenſations towards us. Oh! that we might be enabled ſuitably to regard the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his hand, and repent and reform, and learn the things of our peace before they are hid from our eyes. And while we endeavour to take the beſt human meaſures to oppoſe the unjuſtifiable and cruel deſigns of our enemies againſt us, let us be careful to maintain a conſtant caution againſt a ſpirit of ſelf-ſufficiency and ſelf-confidence, and be guarded againſt truſting to an arm of fleſh: and let us be exhorted to have our prayer continually unto the God of our life, and the Author of all our ſalvation. Let us forſake every wicked and falſe way, and fear and ſerve HIM: and if we are poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of, and governed by the true fear of the omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Jehovah, we ſhall have no reaſon to fear what a pretended <hi>omnipotent parliament,</hi> or any man or body of men can do againſt us. HE whoſe throne is in the heavens, and whoſe kingdom ruleth over all, hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wiſdom and power to extricate us out of all our difficulties, and if we wait upon him in a way of duty in due time we ſhall ſee his ſalvation. May the cries of his people throughout this whole <hi>continent,</hi> be ſincere, fervent and perſevering—may we all deeply lament our national degeneracy and corruption, and our land-defiling abominations and ſinful departures from the God of our fathers—may we ſincerely repent of our perſonal ſins, and <hi>obtain the like precious faith of God's elect</hi>—may God Almighty change the hearts and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of men which are inimical to the true intereſt of his people—Heaven interpoſe and ſave the nation from impending ruin!—and may we in this land be ever <hi>the ſaved of the Lord;</hi> and may he enable us to pleaſe
