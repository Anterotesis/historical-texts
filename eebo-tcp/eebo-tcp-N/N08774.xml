            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>Whether he hath gone to <hi>ſleep</hi> on his poſt where he had been long <hi>nodding</hi> before, or hath retired from it in the conſcious triumph of having ſo ſtrengthened the hopes and fixed the vigilance of his party in America, that no friend of the CHURCH ſhall henceforth dare to attack or even approach their lines, or whether (as is more confidently ſaid) his ſilence is only <hi>political</hi> and for a time, in expectation that during one ſhort month's forbearance of ſlander and abuſe, good natured eaſy <hi>Church-men</hi> may be ſo made to <hi>forget</hi> and <hi>forgive</hi> what is paſt, as to become willing <hi>tools</hi> to ſerve the purpoſes of their very calumniators themſelves at the enſuing election; I ſay, which ever of theſe may be the cauſe of the <hi>Centinel</hi>'s ſudden and unexpected ſilence, the ANATOMIST ventures to approach him with his inſtruments of <hi>diſſection;</hi> yet ſcorns to fall to ſlaſhing or <hi>cutting up</hi> in a manner unbecoming his profeſſion, without calling him to ſtand on his guard, whether he <hi>ſleepeth,</hi> or peradventure dreameth awake, of his own paſt feats and wonderful proweſs.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, to drop all farther alluſion to the title of this paper, and to proceed with great ſeriouſneſs:—The treatment which the <hi>Church</hi> hath met with for many months paſt, from certain ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſcribblers in three of the capital provinces of America, hath been matter of aſtoniſhment and grief to good men of very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent religious perſuaſions; who cannot but ſuſpect ſome dark and wicked deſign lurking under ſo much unmerited abuſe.</p>
               <p>That a CHURCH whoſe venerable martyrs, unawed by perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, undaunted by <hi>fire</hi> and <hi>faggot</hi> ſtood firm in ſupport of the reformation;—A CHURCH which is the principal bulwark of <hi>proteſtaniſm</hi> and true Engliſh <hi>liberty,</hi> as well as the brighteſt example of moderation and Chriſtian charity to all who diſſent
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011212_0006_0F862CE5B2379358"/>from her, ſhould be thus baſely vilified and traduced by an aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring overbearing party, who never knew how to exerciſe the like virtues when in power themſelves; and at a time too when the cauſe of general liberty in America requires the cloſeſt union of all perſuaſions, cannot be eaſily reconciled to any motives of public good.</p>
               <p>An anſwer however to the <hi>Centinel</hi> was forborne, that no inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption might be given on the part of the Church to any union of councils that might be thought neceſſary in the preſent criſis. To thoſe worthy members who expreſſed uneaſineſs at this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, it was replied, that the foundations of the CHURCH were on a rock, which could ſcarcely be <hi>ſhaken,</hi> much leſs over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned by ſuch attempts; that an anſwer would be given when it could be ſeen what plan, if any, the <hi>Centinel</hi> had; and when the meaſure of his abuſe ſhould be ſo full that longer ſilence would be deemed inexcuſable, and a retaliation be juſtified in the eyes of all impartial men.</p>
               <p>That time is now come. Whatever could be done for the public in our preſent ſituation has been done, uninterrupted by any publications on the part of the <hi>Church</hi> in Pennſylvania. If in matters of leſs conſequence

               <p>All theſe charges are to be found in the Centinel and a writer to whom the Centinel can be no ſtranger, even goes farther and charges the <hi>Church</hi> roundly with taking off King Charles's head.</p>
               <p>If one aſks the reaſon of this ſhameful attack on the Church? It is anſwered by another queſtion—who was the aggreſſor? Why did Dr. Chandler begin? But is Dr. Chandler the Church of England, or the ten thouſandth part of it? or had he any general commiſſion from that <hi>Church,</hi> or even from his own brethren belonging to it in America? This is not pretended; and it is certain, that no more than half a dozen of them ever had an opportunity of ſeeing his pamphlet till in print, and of that number, it is confidently ſaid, not one to the ſouth of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laware.</p>
               <p>If Dr. Chandler has ſaid any thing wrong (and what writer claims abſolute perfection?) he ſhould be anſwered as Dr. Chandler, and ſet right in the ſame mildneſs, that he himſelf hath given an example of. Is it fair to attack the whole Church; its doctrine, diſcipline and conſtitution, on account of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of any ſingle member? Would the Preſbyterians think this fair in any caſe of their own? As for example, <hi>Si parvis magna componere licet,</hi> the <hi>venerable</hi> JOHN CARMICHAEL, the great advocate of the <hi>venerable</hi> Synod of New-York and Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia has declared that he never <q>knew that <hi>venerable</hi> body, in <hi>any inſtance,</hi> act below their <hi>venerable</hi> character of ambaſſadors of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; that they are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of an hundred <hi>gentlemen-clergy,</hi> all reputable and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed gentlemen; that they keep an exact hiſtory of their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, which is to be finally reviſed by an almighty, omniſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, impartial, and moſt righteous judge.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Should any one conclude from thoſe expreſſions (which might be done without much violence to their ſenſe) that <hi>John</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the INFALLIBILITY of the <hi>venerable Synod,</hi> and thinks their minutes fit for God Almighty's own reviſal; and ſhould further contend that the <hi>ſlapdaſh</hi>

                  </note> doctrines of <hi>John</hi> were the doctrines of the whole Preſbyterian <hi>Kirk,</hi> which was therefore to be deemed a ranting enthuſiaſtick <hi>Kirk,</hi> a rotten <hi>Kirk,</hi> a
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011212_0007_0F862CE701026088"/>popiſh <hi>Kirk,</hi> maintaining more than the infallibility of a ſingle Pope—even the infallibility of an <hi>hundred learned reputable Popes,</hi> in full ſynod or conclave met—would this be called fair reaſoning?</p>
               <p>And yet in the ſame way has the Church of England been treated on account of Dr. Chandler, who nevertheleſs ſeems to have given no provocation for it, nor uttered a ſingle word reflecting on the principles of any proteſtant denomination. If then Dr. Chandler had been the aggreſſor, (the contrary of which ſhall be ſhewn) if even he had advanced any thing indefenſible on the principles of law, liberty, equity and the Chriſtian reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, would this juſtify the torrent of abuſe and calumny which is poured forth on the Church in anſwer to <hi>him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The deſign of theſe papers, however, is not the defence of Dr. Chandler; who, if he needs any, is ſufficient for that office himſelf. They have a nobler purpoſe in view—the defence of our national Church—of the religion of our ſovereign, and of the far greateſt, and, may I be allowed to ſay, the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable part of his ſubjects.</p>
               <p>In proſecuting this deſign, (though the Centinel has obſerved no certain method) I think it neceſſary to fix ſome plan for my anſwer; and ſhall therefore firſt ſhew that Dr. Chandler, far from being an aggreſſor, is only a defendant in a diſpute which was commenced on the part of the antagoniſts of the Church in New-England as early as 1734; from which time their repeated attacks ſhall be traced down to the publication of Dr. Chandler's pamphlet.</p>
               <p>It is then propoſed to enter the liſts with the Centinel and to ſhew that in the character of the Biſhop, which he and his aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates have drawn, they have been combating a phantom of their own brain; that their true deſign is evidently to oppreſs and bear down the Church for the ſake of an empire of their own, that they have nothing to do with that mode of government and diſcipline which Epiſcopalians chooſe for themſelves, unleſs they could at leaſt ſhew ſome probability of its interfering with the rights of others; that of whatever origin epiſcopal government is, whether <hi>humane</hi> or <hi>divine</hi> it is that which many wiſe men have preferred, and probably ever will prefer to the motely go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Preſbytery, which is not indeed the tyranny of <hi>One,</hi> but too often the tyranny and abſurdity of many; and laſtly that if the civil and religious liberty of America is ever likely to be in danger from any religious perſuaſion here, it is not from the CHUF<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If in anſwering the groſs charges brought againſt the Church, I ſhould be obliged to retort ſeverely on the accuſers, and ſhew who are the clergy that have indeed "loved to fiſh in troubled waters;" who are they that have in reality applied to their own uſe, and to the uſe <q>of their wives and children, large ſums collected for the uſe of the ſavages and frontier ſettlers in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica; who are they that have been <hi>King killers</hi> and nurſed in rebellion from their cradle.</q> Laſtly, if in anſwering the challenge of the <hi>Centinel.</hi> No. V. where he calls on our <hi>Church,</hi> "to ſhew as much moderation as the <hi>New-England Churches.</hi>" I ſay if in anſwering thoſe charges and this challenge, I ſhould be forced even to to diſturb the aſhes of the dead, and be led to compariſons and facts that may prove extremely diſagreeable to the Centinel and his adherents, they muſt blame only them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves who by their illiberal and continued abuſe, have ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly extorted this reply.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of theſe papers it will often be neceſſary to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> as a religious ſociety, in the ſame indiſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate and general manner, in which the Centinel has mentioned the <hi>Church</hi> and Churchmen; but I would be far from being underſtood by this, to mean every individual of the Preſbyterian perſuaſion. I know many among their laity, ſome even among their clergy, who are real friends to the liberties of their country and of mankind, and adorned with a truly Catholic and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing ſpirit. Such I revere, and to ſuch I truſt no offence can be given while I riſe in oppoſition to thoſe of a contrary ſpirit among them, namely their factious and aſpiring leaders, the greateſt part of their clergy:—For I ſee nothing ſacred in the name of <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> to protect a ſour turbulent party, that aſſume that appellation, who by their unbounded zeal to multiply converts, and to exalt their own party, and their uncharitable attempts to depreſs, vilify and miſrepreſent others, eſpecially the national Church of England, have juſtly alarmed the fears of every other religious perſuaſion in America, and created a jealouſy that the ſole view of this party is to erect an empire and eſtabliſhment for themſelves in this new world on the, ruin of every other religious denomination. The ſteps that they have lately purſued in America, compared with their conduct in former times, when in the purſuit of empire in the Mother Country, give but too much ground for this ſuſpicion. But before they can ſucceed in their deſigns, they will meet with a <hi>reſiſtance</hi> far different from what is to be expected in this paper. —A reſiſtance perhaps even unto blood.—To prevent this, to bring down their temper to the juſt ſtandard of Chriſtian charity and toleration; and to ſhew themſelves to themſelves and wipe off the reproaches which they have caſt on the Church, is the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011212_0008_0F862CE723DCE880"/>main deſign of this paper,—which it is hoped will be carried on with a firmneſs and ſpirit, worthy of ſuch a deſign; and yet without deviating into any recriminations or cenſures that are <hi>perſonal</hi> or not neceſſarily connected with the defence in hand.</p>

               <p>IN the former number of this paper, it was obſerved that the common apology made by the Centinel's friends, for the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly and illiberal manner in which he has abuſed and calumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated the Church, is, that Dr. Chandler, by the publication of his pamphlet, in favour of an American epiſcopacy, was the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor.—The futility of this apology hath been fully ſhewn.— Dr. Chandler made no attack on the principles of any proteſtant perſuaſion, and therefore nothing done by him could juſtify an attack on the church in general—No way then can Dr. Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's publication juſtify the Centinel, unleſs he can ſhew it to be a crime for a member of the church of England to contend for thoſe rights and privileges, which he conſiders as eſſential to the being of a church—But the Centinel probably judges that all power and privileges in America are the property of his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as the ELECT; and that it is a daring attack upon their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, for any other church to claim even a being, much leſs a well-being, in the ſame land with them.—However, let this be, or not be, the ſentiments of the Centinel, certain it is, that the preſbyterians and independents of New-England have ever
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011212_0008_0F862CE723DCE880"/>looked upon that country as a kind of Deodand, or godly heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, derived to them from Heaven; and to which none but themſelves have right or claim—"We hold our lands" (ſays a Boſton Almanack, for the year 1763) "under no other Lord, but he who gave Canaan to Abraham."

               <p>I proceed therefore to ſhew who have been the aggreſſors, and who the defendants, in this cauſe; and, for the preſent, need go no farther back than the year 1734.</p>
               <p>In that year we find the preſbyterians and independents afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid baſely attacking the church, vilifying her clergy in language which all the other writers of that party, down to our magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Centinel, ſeem only to have copied.—We find them likewiſe claiming an eſtabliſhment and empire for themſelves; loudly complaining that epiſcopalians ſhould be ſuffered to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Holy Land, or come among them to lay blocks in the way of their church power; and therefore they boldly addreſs the Biſhop of London to ſend the epiſcopal miſſionaries back among the ſavages, or to ſome other part of America.</p>
               <p>Both the addreſs and anſwers being curious, and greatly tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſhew the early deſigns of this party for power and domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and their intolerant uncharitable ſpirit, I ſhall give the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary extracts from them.</p>

                              <q>The miſſionaries are neither neceſſary or profitable, but as to many inſtances injurious to the intereſt of the kingdom of Chriſt, and the good of his majeſty's ſubjects.</q>

               <p>But an opportunity of doing this, they thought, might be loſt if epiſcopal miſſionaries were ſent and ſettled among then—For, after telling the biſhop, in the words already quoted, that their <q>Fathers ſettled a wilderneſs that they might, in a place of their own, and without offence to other governing powers, ſerve God according to their conſciences,</q> they proceed to inform his lordſhip, this is, <q>a liberty which we have too great reaſon to fear may in time be wreſted from us, by means of ſuch miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionaries, as have ſet themſelves to ſet blocks in the way of

               <p>LONG hath the impartial public looked for the defence which you have now begun.—The church of England hath ever been deemed by all proteſtants (a few hot-headed ſects who aſſume that appellation excepted) a church not only pure and orthodox in her doctrines, catholic and charitable in her prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, but a church likewiſe which has been a glorious inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in helping forward the reformation, and in aſſerting and ſupporting the cauſe of proteſtantiſm even in the triumphant days of papacy, when the ſword of perſecution was often ſheathed in her bowels.—This is a character which the reformers themſelves have given her,—and which the wiſeſt and ableſt divines abroad have declared to be due to her. Monſieur Le Moyne, profeſſor of divinity at Leyden, a man diſtinguiſhed in the learned world, and whoſe aſſertion will receive credit wherever his name is known, in a letter to the biſhop of London, obſerves, that the foreign proteſtant churches have always viewed the church of

               <p>All theſe things, Mr. Anatomiſt, and much more, you muſt take into your plan, if you expect to complete your work.

                  </gap>; but firſt, let me ſay ſomething of its origin. The independents, known at firſt by the name of Browniſts, from one Robert Brown, their ſounder or leader, "were the very worſt and moſt troubleſome of all the Engliſh ſectaries. By the rebellious principles they taught, they rendered themſelves ſo obnoxious to the government, that they thought fit to tranſport themſelves to Amſterdam, where they ſoon began to differ among themſelves, and crumble into ſo many parties, that Mr. Brown grew weary of his office; and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This revolt of Brown was attended with almoſt the total diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his church; but part of the ſcattered flock being collected by Mr. John Robinſon, one of their preachers, they removed with him to Leyden about the year 1610. Here they remained 7 years, but at length, the Dutch either grew weary of them, or they grew weary of the Dutch, for they complained of having ſuffered very great hardſhips among them, declaring that impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment in England was preferable to the condition of refugees in Holland, whereupon many of them actually returned to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland. Robinſon and his elders apprehending a general deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hit upon this expedient to keep them together, and increaſe their numbers: They repreſented that New-England was not only a place that abounded with all things deſirable in life, but that there were great expectations of diſcovering treaſures equal to thoſe of Mexico or Peru, and that there they might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the founders of ſome mighty ſtate. Such a promiſing ſcheme could not fail of having the deſired effect; the adventurers therefore ſet themſelves to work to purchaſe a territory in New-England of the Plymouth Company, and to obtain a patent from the crown.

<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011212_0013_0F862CEDEC2160E8"/>November following. As ſoon as they got footing on ſhore, they determined to have no regard to the patents they had obtained from the crown, but to elect a governor, and ſtrike out ſuch a form of government as beſt ſuited their deſigns. Having there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore formed an aſſociation, and agreed to ſubmit to ſuch laws as ſhould be approved by a majority, they dre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Soon after this, Mr. Weſton, a merchant, came over with a number of paſſengers, in order to form a ſettlement, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſat down at a place called Weſaguſquaſet, afterwards Weymouth; but unfortunately for Mr. Weſton and his people they happened to be members of the church of England, and being therefore looked upon with an evil eye by the independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and abandoned to the fury of the ſavages, they were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to quit their ſettlement, with the following character from their pious and godly neighbou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, <q>Weſton and his men were ſo ſcandalouſly wicked, that they were a nuſance to the very ſavages.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after this, Capt. Gorges came over with ſeveral families, and Mr. Murres, a miniſter, all of the epiſcopal perſuaſion, with a deſign to reſtore the ſettlement Weſton had quitted; but this gentleman alſo finding how obnoxious he was to the Saints, returned to England, and ſays the puritanical hiſtorian "his biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op followed him."</p>
               <p>The company in a little time after, ſent over Mr. Lyford as chaplain in the Plymouth colony, who being an epiſcopalian, would have performed divine ſervice and adminiſtered the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments after the manner of the church of England; but the plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters compelled him to conform himſelf to their way of worſhip, and at laſt drove him fairly off.</p>
               <p>Some of the planters however, being conſcientious churchmen, and finding that they could have no miniſters of their own, ſet up an aſſembly, wherein they uſed the liturgy of the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and of theſe Mr Samuel Brown, a lawyer, and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther John Brown, a merchant, men of eſtates and figure, were the chief, being of the number of the firſt patentees. The depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty governor ſending to theſe gentlemen to demand the reaſon of their ſeparation, they repreſented, that as they were of the church eſtabliſhed by law in their native country, it was highly reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able they ſhould worſhip God in the manner that government re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired from which they received their charter; at leaſt they ought to allow the members of the church that liberty of conſcience they themſelves thought ſo reaſonable when they were on the other ſide of the water; and as one article in their charter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that all perſuaſions of Chriſtians ſhould have liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcience,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011212_0013_0F862CEDEC2160E8"/>they did not know whether their denying it to them was not a forfeiture of their charter. But theſe arguments were called <hi>ſeditious</hi> and <hi>mutinous,</hi> and the <hi>holy brethren,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining to ſuffer none to reſide there, that were not of the ſame levelling principles in Church and State as they profeſſed, forced the two Mr. <hi>Brown</hi>'s to return back to <hi>Old-England</hi> in the ſame ſhip that brought them over.</p>
               <p>About the year 1630, one Mr. <hi>Blackſtone,</hi> an <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> miniſter, built a little houſe oppoſite to <hi>Charles Town,</hi> by virtue whereof he laid claim to the whole Peninſula, but the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this town obſerving that the <hi>parſon</hi>'s ſituation was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable to their own, they immediately diſpoſſeſſed him, and juſtified the outrage by ſuggeſting that Mr. <hi>Blackſtone was an odd ſort of a man, who would not join himſelf with any of their New England churches;</hi> and when they had driven away this <hi>odd ſort of a man,</hi> they laid the foundation of their capital city upon this very ſpot of ground, to which they gave the name of <hi>Boſton.</hi>"</p>
               <p>Having thus ſilenced or baniſhed the <hi>Epiſcopalians,</hi> they then fell foul of one another, and divided into two factions, the one zealous for the <hi>covenant of works,</hi> and the other for the <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of grace.</hi> For as the witty <hi>Butler</hi> obſerves,

                     <p>As in various inſtances you have given undoubted evidence of your impartiality; particularly by your giving a place not only to the American Whig and Pennſylvania Centinel, but alſo to the Anatomiſt; I hope therefore; you will inſert the following in your very uſeful paper, which will oblige more than your friend</p>

               <p>THE God of Truth has informed us, that a <hi>kingdom di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided againſt itſelf cannot ſtand;</hi> and that ſuch as <hi>bite and devour one another, will be deſtroyed one of another.</hi> And the evidences we have in every age of the truth of theſe aſſertions, muſt oblige all to grant, that <hi>the ſtrength of a people depends on their harmony in ſentiment and conduct.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thoſe therefore who ſtudy to promote truth and concord among men, ought to be conſidered as their true friends; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſuch as endeavour to divide, and ſtir up contentions, may juſtly be deemed their enemies and deſtroyers. How affecting is it then that meaſures of this deſtructive nature are purſued by any among us? As I learn from a late paper, there are, by one who ſtiles himſelf the Anatomiſt. As for the Centinel whom he attacks, the American Whig, or yet Dr. Chandler, I know little of them; having read but a few paragraphs in any one, and not ſeen the others, and therefore cannot be a judge of what they have ſaid. Nor is it my deſign to vindicate <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he Centinel; ſhould that be requiſite, it belongs to himſelf. But I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that Dr, Chandler raiſed the debate, at this time, in theſe middle provinces, and publickly inſiſted for an anſwer. And if the Centinel has given one, and therein attacked the Church of England, this is not to be imputed to the Preſbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an or Independent Church, as the Anatomiſt does, had the Centinel gone ever ſo far wrong. <hi>For</hi> (to uſe the Anatomiſt's own way of reaſoning, which in this appears juſt) <hi>is the Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel the Independent, or yet the Preſbyterian Church? or the ten thouſandth part of either of them?</hi> Or had he any <hi>general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from theſe Churches;</hi> or a commiſſion <hi>from any in them? That is not pretended. It does not appear that</hi> ſo much as one,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011212_0015_0F862CEF6405F068"/>much leſs that <hi>half a dozen, ever had the ſight of the Centinel's pieces till in print. If the Continel has ſaid any thing wrong, (and what writer claims abſolute perſection) he ſhould be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered as the Centinel, and ſet right. Is it fair to attack the whole Church on account of the writings of any ſingle perſon? Would the Epiſcopalians think this fair in any caſe of their own?</hi> How unfairly then does the Anatomiſt act (himſelf being judge) who (when ſpeaking of the Church of England) ſays, <q>it has been baſely vilified and traduced, by an aſpiring over-bearing party,</q> (referring to the Preſbyterians) and that <q>if they were conſiſtent with themſelves, and really believed what they have printed, they ought to be covered with confuſion to ſolicit either union or communion, in any matter whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, with the members of a Church which their Centinel and his adherents have painted in the following odious charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</q> And then, he mentions various charges againſt the Church of England, which he ſays are to be found in the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel. And having found theſe in one who calls himſelf the Pennſylvania Centinel, (whether a Preſbyterian or not I cannot tell) he goes on to repreſent the Preſbyterian ſociety in a very ſhocking light indeed; is no way ſparing of the baſeſt charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which, it ſeems, come readier to him than arguments. He even inſinuates, that they are at laſt begun to plot ſome horrible things; and that the civil and religious liberty of America is in danger from them; with abundance of the like. In his viſions he is even carried into the field of battle; and talks of reſiſting unto blood! 'Tis to be hoped that Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians will not ſurmiſe that ſuch ſcurrility and unmannerly treatment is approved of by any ſober Churchmen. It cannot. Hiſtory informs us that in Britain, Ireland, Germany and America, Presbyterians have been full as loyal and pacific as other churches; and we have found it true. The Anatomiſt, by overturning the rubbiſh of confuſed times, may find enough in any Church to make <hi>him</hi> cautious. By raking up the aſhes of the dead, and repreſenting things agreeable to his own tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, he may indeed foment debates, promote jealouſies in the minds of inconſiderate perſons, and favour ſome political plans not very ſalutary to the colonies. But, is it likely, that by good reaſoning, he will either be of ſervice or an honour to the Church of England? On the contrary has he not given too much reaſon to ſuſpect, either tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> his capacity is inſufficient to maintain a conſiſtency in his reaſoning, or that his paſſions will not permit him? Even the paragraph of Mr. Carmichael, that he has foiſted into his piece, though not expreſſed in the beſt manner, may be taken in a conſiſtent and juſtifiable ſenſe;
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011212_0015_0F862CEF6405F068"/>but his own performance never can. And is not ſuch a defence worſe than none? Wherefore, if he would be ſo wiſe as to take a friendly advice, he would reſign the Centinel at preſent to another hand. And if he really believes what he has printed, that the Centinel <hi>has been long nodding,</hi> he need not doubt that he has dropped aſleep, and conſequently that it would be no credit to an Anatomiſt either to flay him, or begin his kind of operation upon him in that condition, but had better take a nap alſo. Would he but yield to this, we might have ſome hopes that after his awaking he would be much better compoſed, and inclined to entertain us with ſomething ſalutary and pacific. Therefore, wiſhing him a calm repoſe, I proceed to ſeek what is of more importance, the peace of my country.</p>
               <p>Although our ſeperate intereſts in theſe American provinces have ſometimes occaſioned jars; yet the harmony that of late appeared in ſupport of our common privileges muſt, I think, afford unſpeakable pleaſure to every lover of his country. For my own part, I conſider the man as a friend, a brother and a patron, who undauntedly exerts himſelf to promote a rational concord either in Church or State. Some have merited well of the State by their eſſays to unite us in political affairs, as the Pennſylvania Farmer. And would to God that the zealous contenders for Chriſtianity would ſhew their ſkill, and be more aſſiduous in labouring to heal our unchriſtian diviſions in the Church. Upon this head let me beg the attention of ſuch, to the following queries. Is there any country in the world more divided in their ſentiments about religion than we are? Are not our diviſions very injurious in many reſpects? Do they not weaken confidence, promote jealouſies, mar our profiting by the gifts and talents of each other, put a ſtumbling block in the way of infidels, open a door to error, and greatly diſhonour God? Would not our agreement in ſpiritual truths and duties tend more, firmly to unite us in our temporal affairs, and render us more like an army with banners, yea like the heavenly ſociety? Has not the Church of Chriſt been long expecting and praying for a time of greater purity and peace? And has not God himſelf given us grounds to expect this by his promiſe Col. xiv. 9. that <hi>he ſhall be king over all the earth; that there ſhall be one Lord, and his name one;</hi> and by many other places to the like purpoſe? He will ſurely accompliſh his promiſes in the uſe of means; and as he has not told us the time when, ought we not always to be uſing ſuch means as appear proper? Do we expect or can we attempt any thing more noble in this world? How abſurd would it be for enquirers after truth (which we all profeſs ourſelves to be) to content themſelves with
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:011212_0016_0F862CF0B3652678"/>being of the ſame religion with their anceſtors, ſo glory that they are of the ſame religion with the King? Has all been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted that can, or may not the ſame attempts be renewed? Altho' a reconciliation with ſome has long ago been attempted in vain, are we ſure it will always be ſo; or are all differences of a religious nature incurable? A union between Epiſcopali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Presbyterians is deſired by thouſands on both ſides. Their difference in articles about the doctrines of religion is next to nothing. There is not that ſtrictneſs with regard to ſome canons and ceremonies that uſed to be; and an emenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in theſe is deſired by a great many ſober Epiſcopalians. We have no dignified Clergymen whoſe intereſt might perhaps pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their yielding to ſome requiſitions that poſſibly might be thought reaſonable, ſo that now is the fitteſt like ſeaſon. But if an agreement between theſe churches cannot be effected, perhaps it might between others that do not differ ſo much. And were prudent and Chriſtian meaſures taken, a better underſtanding might be promoted among all Conſider that attempts of this nature have been ſucceſsful of late years among ſome who had been at great variance. A happy omen truly! But as ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to hear the minds of others, I hope they will take the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and ſpeak freely. And let them conſider, that <hi>the Lord bleſſes the peace-makers, and calls them his children;</hi> whereas <hi>he who ſoweth diſcord among brethren is one of thoſe ſeven things that are an abomination to the Lord.</hi> If perſons of moderation and judgment on each ſide would agree candidly to diſcuſs the matters of difference, adhere to neceſſary regulations in their reaſoning, ſubmit to the corrections of men choſen to keep them to rule; might not this anſwer a good end? Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if friendly conferences were agreed upon and kept up. Si quid noviſti rectius iſtis candidus imparte, ſi non, his utere mecum.</p>

               <p>AT length after many a promiſe and many a threat, por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending great events, the eccleſiaſtical Anatomiſt ſtands forth brandiſhing his knife.

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011212_0016_0F862CF0B3652678"/>with fire and faggot; but he foreſaw and marked the critical ſeaſon, when the Centinel being a ſleep, he might fall upon him, cut him limb from limb, and give his fleſh for food to the fowls of the air, and the beaſts of the field. Long had I deſired to contribute towards the deſirable work of demoliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that doughty Centinel; but while the firſt rate advocate of our Church ſtood by in ſilent gaze, I thought it would be prudent to forbear.—Encouraged now by the Anatomiſt, who kindly invites all <hi>the enemies of faction and friends of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, liberty and toleration,</hi> to communicate their thoughts to the public, I have ventured, tho' not ſo fortunate, as he is in <hi>leiſure</hi> and Abilities, to beſpeak the attention of the public, while I offer a few arguments in favour of an American Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, in oppoſition to the Centinel, and all his <hi>ſcribbling factious friends.</hi> I have ſaid, I ſhall offer ſome arguments, the reader is not to ſuppoſe they are ſuch trifling ones as Bacon or Locke would have offered; but ſuch as are uſually advanced by the advocates of our Church in this more enlightened age:—Yet conſcious how unfit I am to produce any new arguments that will bear this teſt, I ſhall generally take the liberty of borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Anatomiſt,—

                     <q>The Centinel <hi>has painted the Church in the moſt odious cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.</hi> He calls her—<hi>A Church that has long encroached on the rights of conſcience, and oppreſſed her fellow Chriſtian,</hi>
                        <pb n="33" facs="unknown:011212_0017_0F862CF16ACEBD80"/>—which is not true, for ſhe has no teſt act—A number of other falſehoods he has advanced about her <hi>corrupting the pure word of God by human inventions—ſquandering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way large ſums of money in ſupport of miſſionaries,</hi> and ſuch groundleſs aſpertions—Wherefore is our Church loaded with all this calumny? For no other reaſon than that <hi>Dr. Chandler in the ſpirit of meekneſs</hi> wrote a ſmall book, in hopes of recommending an American Biſhop—But why ſhould Preſbyterians be angry with Dr. Chandler for ſuch an innocent milky performance, ſurely he ſaid no harm of them.</q> He only ſaid, or rather hinted, that they are all rebels in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and have no <hi>natural right</hi> to any place of profit or truſt under the government—that their teachers are no miniſters, and that they are no Chriſtians—<q>Now ſurely, it is not fair to abuſe the Dr. for this meek ſort of writing, much leſs is it fair to abuſe the Church on the account of its advocate Dr. Chandler, any more than it would be fair to traduce the Synod of Philadelphia, on account of their advocate John Carmichael, for the caſes are perfectly ſimilar,</q> with this trifling difference, that the Dr. wrote by the approbation, order and aſſiſtance of a general convention of our clergy, and John only wrote for and by himſelf diſ-connected with any ſoul living. <q>Yet, notwithſtanding that the caſes are ſo perfectly ſimilar, we have the good nature and modeſty not to inſiſt much on it.</q> That the Synod are acountable for John's blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as when he ſays or ſwears that he is the learned member of a <hi>learned body,</hi> while the very performance proves that he is quite as illeterate as any ſon of our Church in that part of the country, which is ſaying a great deal for him. Ah John! John! It's a pity you had ever thought of printing your lucu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations ſince <hi>you had no time to write for the Preſs.</hi> If you ſhould ever think of appearing again in print be perſuaded to purſue a different plan.—Take example from your brother Thomas up the way—Since you are ignorant don't be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to ſteal, 'tis a common and a thriving traffick; whether you preach or publiſh, don't trouble the world with any more of your ſlap-daſh ſermons; borrow or ſteal, tho' it were from another Church—Some good Chriſtians hold all things in common—By ſuch ſhifty means, as theſe, <hi>unanimity and public</hi> ſpirit not long ſince elevated a Miſſionary in our Church, to the higheſt pitch of eminence and literary fame.—But of this on ſome future occaſion. In the mean time I inſiſt on it, that unleſs we traduce the Synod on John's account, it will be very indecent in the Preſbyterians to ſpeak hard of any other perſon living, on account of Dr. Chandler, who, as I proved
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011212_0018_0F862CF2387DF1D0"/>juſt now, <hi>has not uttered a ſingle word reflecting on the principles of any proteſtant denomination. But the deſign of the following papers, is not the defence of Dr. Chandler,</hi> which by the way brings me in compliance with the prevailing cuſtom, to preſent the reader with a bill of fare. In the firſt place, negatively, tho' we are going to anſwer the Anatomiſt, who has attempted a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal refutation of Dr. Chandler's argument, yet we ſhall not ſo much as attempt to ſupport the Dr. and of courſe, we ſhall not interfere with the Centinel, except to call him a factious ſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler, &amp;c.—I know better things than to defend the Doctor or his appeal, we have obſerved what advantage the adverſary has gained over him, and have therefore reſolved to ſurrender him and his appeal to be devoured by Whigs and Centinels, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it has ever been accounted better policy to deſert a weak fortreſs, than attempt its defence,—Secondly, by anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Centinel, we humbly preſume no man can be ſo abſurd as to think we have any thing to do with the truth and validity of his arguments upon the danger of Epiſcopal eſtabliſhments in this new world, &amp;c. ſuch arguments are below our notice. But thirdly, we are determines to carry the war into the enemy's country, and give them a Rowland for their Oliver.—We ſhall prove that the Preſbyterians and Independents are and have been enemies to our Church, and that for this and ſeveral other reaſons they are a ſet of factious, ſeditious, reſtleſs, ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, hypocritical, enthuſiaſtic, fanatical, rebellious, impudent fellows. Theſe things, with ſundry others, being fairly proved or being frequently aſſerted, it muſt follow of natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that a biſhop is a very harmleſs perſon. That intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing him here by act of parliament, veſting him with proper powers, and maintaining him by a ſmall public tax, &amp;c. is not, and cannot be injurious to the civil or religious liberties of any denomination of Chriſtians on the continent. Perhaps the reader does not ſee how ſuch conſequences can follow from the premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; but they muſt and ſhall follow—for to ſpeak our mind plainly, we have a had opinion of the vulgar method of handling a debate—Nothing is ſo ſtubborn as plain direct argument; We are determined to ſhun it—But we ſhall deal pretty freely with the characters of the dead, and if the Centinel or his ghoſt ſhould ever think proper to anſwer us, we ſhall lead him ſuch a wild-gooſe chace from one piece of ſcandal to another, that no perſon ſhall be able to gueſs, in a little time, what was the original ſubject of debate.—As to the queſtion whether a biſhop ſhould be ſent over to America, how he ſhould be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and how the liberties of other denominations of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians would be ſafe within his reach.

But the moment that any favourable or friendly diſpoſitions appear in the people towards us, they are checked and diſcouraged by their leaders and paſtors. This appears evident from numberleſs inſtances, and particularly from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing one, faithfully deduced from hiſtory; and with which I ſhall finiſh my remarks of the early and violent oppoſition which the Church met with in <hi>New-England.</hi>

                  <p>"Soon after the eſtabliſhment of the ſociety for the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the goſpel in foreign parts, in the year 1701, the Rev. Mr. <hi>Muirſon</hi> was ſent Miſſionary to <hi>Rye,</hi> in the government of <hi>New-York.</hi> The people of <hi>Stratford</hi> in the colony of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut,</hi> diſtant from <hi>Rye</hi> about 60 miles, earneſtly requeſted Mr. <hi>Muirſon</hi> to pay them a viſit, to which he agreed. Colonel <hi>Heathcote,</hi> a worthy gentleman of a conſiderable intereſt in <hi>Weſt-Cheſter,</hi> was pleaſed to accompany Mr. <hi>Muirſon</hi> in this progreſs, and afterwards wrote to the ſociety the following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their reception there. <q>We found that colony much as we expected, very ignorant of the conſtitution of our <hi>Church,</hi> and therefore enemies to it. The towns are furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with miniſters chiefly <hi>Independants,</hi> who were very uneaſy at our coming among them, and abundance of pains were taken to terrify the people from hearing Mr. <hi>Muirſon;</hi> but it availed nothing, for notwithſtanding all their endeavours, we had a very great congregation; and the people were won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully ſurpriſed at the order of our Church, expecting to have heard ſome ſtrange thing, by the accounts and repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of it that their teachers had given them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe people having zealouſly preſſed Mr. <hi>Muirſon</hi> to come again to them, he was honoured with Colonel <hi>Heathcote</hi>'s company in his ſecond viſit. They now found the people much more earneſt to have the Church worſhip ſettled among them, and the <hi>Independents</hi> more incenſed. The miniſters and magiſtrates were remarkably induſtrious, going from houſe to houſe perſuading the people from hearing Mr. <hi>Muirſon,</hi> and threatening thoſe with puniſhment and impriſonment who would go to hear him preach. Mr. <hi>Muirſon</hi> deſcribes their oppoſition in theſe words. <q>One of their magiſtrates, with ſome other officers, came to my lodgings, and in the hearing of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                     </q> —Now, whatever interpretation the words of the ſaid law may admit of, yet <hi>we</hi> are to regard the ſenſe and force <hi>they</hi> put upon them; which is plainly <hi>this,</hi> to exclude the Church their government, as appears by their proceedings with me. So that hereby they deny a liberty of conſcience to the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> people, as well as to all others that are not of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; which being repugnant to the laws of <hi>England,</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the grant of their charter.</p>
                  <p>But theſe methods which the <hi>Independents</hi> uſed, were ſo far from hindering the people from reſorting to the Church ſervice, that ſtill greater numbers came; and other towns ſent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited Mr. <hi>Muirſon</hi> to viſit them; particularly the people of <hi>Fairfield,</hi> to whom he went next. The <hi>Independents</hi> uſed all means to obſtruct him, and refuſed him the uſe of the meeting-houſe, though on a week day; but the principal gentleman of the town invited him to his houſe, where he preached to a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous congregation, and afterwards deſcribed to the ſociety the oppoſition he ſtill met with in theſe words: <q>The people were likewiſe threatened with <hi>impriſonment</hi> and a forfeiture of <hi>five pounds</hi> for coming to hear me. It would require more time than you would willingly beſtow on theſe Lines, to expreſs how rigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſeverely they treat our people, by taking their eſtates by diſtreſs when they do not willingly pay to ſupport their miniſters; and though every <hi>Churchman</hi> in that colony pays his rate for building and repairing their meeting-houſes, yet they are ſo ſet againſt us, that they deny us the uſe of them, though on a week day. All that the <hi>Churchmen</hi> in this colony requeſt, is, that they may not be oppreſſed and inſulted over; that they may obtain a liberty of conſcience, and call a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of their own; that they may be freed from paying to <hi>their</hi> miniſters and thereby be enabled to maintain their own; this is all theſe good men deſire.</q>

               <p>DR. Chandler's appeal is a noted performance, in which he repreſents the epiſcopal church in America as oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, perſecuted and groaning under unparallelled hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips for want of an epiſcopate eſtabliſhed in theſe colonies. He with great confidence propoſes a new plan of epiſcopacy, agreed on as he aſſerts, by the epiſcopal church in England and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, which unlike the epiſcopate eſtabliſhed in England, ſhall have no concern with the probate of wills or affairs matrimoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al or relating to ſcandal, nor hurt the civil or religious rights of any other denomination; and he challenges every man in the colonies or elſe where to make objections to this new plan, if they have any, or if they be ſilent, it will be taken for granted that all parties acquieſce and are ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>He has likewiſe ſtrongly aſſerted the divine right of dioceſan epiſcopacy, and the neceſſity of an uninterupted ſucceſſion of biſhops for the ordination of miniſters, nay he makes this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken line as neceſſary, as to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:011212_0022_0F862CF7C7A8D890"/>excludes all the miniſters of the proteſtant churches from the number of Chriſt's miniſters, who derive not their pedigree from St. Peter, diſregarding this ridiculous pretenſion.</p>
               <p>He repreſents the prelates that are to be ſent on this new plan, as perſons to be inveſted with great power and dignity, to protect both the clergy and laity; for whoſe ſupport great funds are provided; who may poſſibly be entruſted with great power in our civil affairs, and for whoſe ſupport he tells us, it is reaſonable that we ſhould all be taxed, and that we deſerve not the name of good ſubjects if we ſhould complain if taxed for this purpoſe; nay, he tells us, that the epiſcopal church is eſtabliſhed in America as well as in England, for it is a part of that church, and all that belong not to that church by law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, have no natural rights to any degree of civil or milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power.</p>
               <p>When ſuch a challenge was given to all the American colonies, is it a crime, to make objections when thus called on by the Doctor? Were his high pretenſions to be paſſed without notice? or how can this univerſal appeal be called a continuation of a diſpute between the epiſcopal and other New-England miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? Was the appeal made to them only, or was it to every denomination in the Engliſh colonies? or did Dr. Chauncey who wrote a methodical anſwer to the appeal ever underſtand or ſuſpect, that it was a continuation of an old controverſy? The Centinel does not think that he had any concern with the New-England controverſies, the rejectors of dioceſan epiſcopacy in thoſe four provinces are able to manage their own affairs, and in the judgment of moſt men are more than a match for their adverſaries in America, even with the aſſiſtance of their friends beyond the Atlantic, though we are told that a high dignitary of the church of England refreſhed their drooping ſpirits by his ſeaſonable interpoſition, nay Dr. Chandler, ſets this controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy in a different light and tells us, <q>that having addreſſed the public on the expediency of an American epiſcopate, he and his brethren judged it a matter of neceſſity and duty fairly to explain this plan on which biſhops had been requeſted to offer to the public the reaſons of this requeſt, and to obviate objections: For this reaſon he was ordered to publiſh the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, that all might either be ſatisfied or that ſuch as were not, might publiſh their objections,</q> yet our modeſt <hi>Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> declares the Doctor was not the aggreſſor, and thus all theſe objects that he diſlikes or cannot anſwer, are called unme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited abuſe.</p>
               <p>It has been often objected to Dr. Chandler, that he has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the world no aſſurance that his propoſed plan of Epiſcopacy
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:011212_0022_0F862CF7C7A8D890"/>ſo ſavourable to civil and religious liberty is approved by all the Epiſcopal Churches in England and America; that if it gave all the colonies the univerſal ſatisfaction that he expected, yet it was propoſed by himſelf only, or by a few of his friends, and would be denied or oppoſed by all the narrow bigots in that church, it would probably be rejected by the powers that could confirm i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, for ſome political reaſons, as it would weaken the dependency of the colonies on the mother country; and it would be rejected by all ſober men, becauſe theſe biſhops were only to inſpect the morals of the clergy, whilſt the laity were totally to be neglected. And it was alledged that prelates, if once ſent among us, would erect their eccleſiaſtical courts, as in former times, and poſſibly vex every religious denomination, that they were pleaſed to call diſſenters, as in the days of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop Land, and ſome of his ſucceſſors, whoſe tyranny drove many to ſeek habitations in this wilderneſs. Theſe fears arouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and alarmed great numbers who paid little regard to Dr. Chandler's fair words, whilſt they ſaw the dangerous ſnare laid for their liberties by his ſpecious propoſals. And we find alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy by the <hi>Anatomiſt,</hi> that our fears were juſt, that moſt of the epiſcopalians paid no regard to his pretences, for he now aſks,—<q>Had Dr. Chandler any general commiſſion from that church or even from his brethren belonging to it in America? This is not, ſays he, pretended. It is certain that not more than half a dozen of them ever had an opportunity of ſeeing his pamphlet till in print.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Centineſ's debate is only with Dr. Chandler, and he with his friends are loudly called on to anſwer the Centinel and to ſhew his miſtakes; if he bears hard on the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land as by law eſtabliſhed, with reſpect to her eccleſiaſtical courts, or any other part of her conduct, he or they are to vindicate her as far as it can be done with truth and candour, and her vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation will be heard with pleaſure and fairly acknowledged, where the defence is juſt; but this <hi>doughty champion</hi> declines this taſk. Yet to ſay ſomething like argument, he cries the national church is abuſed, he will defend the national church —the religion of his Sovereign, and of the far greater and moſt reſpectable part of his ſubjects, and Dr. Chandler is, by him, ſet on a level with Mr. Carmichael, whom no man ever employed nor thanked for meddling with public affairs, both we hope are good men; but our reſpect for Doctor Chandler, makes us reſent the compariſon.</p>
               <p>How <hi>noble is the purpoſe</hi> of the Anatomiſt and how ſecure of a victory? He is in the ſame ſituation with the champion at a coronation, who armed <hi>cap a pee</hi> challenges all pretenders to
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:011212_0023_0F862CF88A5B65D0"/>the crown, in the preſence of the king and his guards—But the Anatomiſt with the bloody knife in his hand muſt be put in mind, that his argument had equal force in the mouth of all the heathen powers who perſecuted the primitive church. It would have equal force in Turkey in defence of the A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They all plead for the national religion, the religion, of their ſovereign, and of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable part of his ſubjects.</p>
               <p>We reſpect the church of England as by law eſtabliſhed, and ſhe is deſervedly reſpected by all Chriſtian churches.</p>
               <p>She has had martyrs that ſealed the truths of the goſpel with their blood, and many biſhops, miniſters, and common Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans eminent for learning, piety and charity, that have been eſteemed bright ornaments of our holy religion: And with pleaſure we acknowledge that her complexion is greatly mended by the act of toleration.</p>
               <p>But ſhe never pretended to infallibility, ſhe daily confeſſes to Almighty God, that ſhe has erred and ſtrayed like a loſt ſheep, and done many things which ſhe ought not to have done, during the long and ſevere execution of the acts of uniformity, the act againſt conventicles and others, that diſtreſſed the followers of the ſame Redeemer and the children of the ſame heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; her looks were ſavage and ſevere, and bore a near reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of her who was drunk with the blood of the ſaints: there were always in her a moderate and a high flying party, and the laſt were for ſevere meaſures to all that did not come into their meaſures. And had the corporation and teſt acts ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver exiſted ſhe had been more lovely and the ſpouſe of him who was meek and lowly in ſpirit. We revere her merit, but are not blind to ber imperfection; in her there is great room for a reformation, this the beſt of her own ſons do allow; nay they loudly call for it; the Lutheran and Calviniſt churches were and are ſtill more truly the bulwark of the reformation than the church of England.

               <p>With theſe reflections, which may ſtand in the room of many that might come in this place, I leave theſe people for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and proceed to a more ſouthern province, where the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the <hi>Church</hi> has been more properly and ſtrictly <hi>Preſbyterian;</hi> but the mode and ſpirit of it the ſame.</p>
               <p>The antagoniſts of the Church in America are well aware of the grievous hardſhips ſhe labours under, in being obliged to ſend her candidates acroſs an ocean of 3000 miles for holy or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and in being at that diſtance from the government of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,—the only mode of government which ſhe can hold agreeable to her conſtitution.

And therefore they think, if they can continue the Church under this hardſhip, and prevent the introduction of a Biſhop into America, by painting the whole order in odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous characters, and dangerous to liberty, they ſhall be able, when they arrive to their

The conſtant endeavour therefore of thoſe antagoniſts of the Church, is to dry up that fund, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting it as miſapplied and perverted from its original inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This charge is always a leading one in every attack upon the Church in America; though it has been often abundantly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, and though it be evident that the greateſt part of the fund comes from the clergy of the Church of England themſelves, who well know for what purpoſe their charity is beſtowed, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; not to mention that the accounts of the ſociety, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to charter, have annually the ſolemn ſanction of the heads of the three great courts in Weſtminſter-hall. Strange it is then that the great oracles of the law, the whole clergy of the Church, and thouſands of pious benefactors in England, ſhould all be ſo deceived in the original deſign of this ſociety, or ſhould be ſo deſperately wicked as to connive at, or encourage a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of it; and that a few zealots at 3000 miles diſtance ſhould be the only perſons acquainted with the purpoſes for which the ſociety was inſtituted.</p>
               <p>Upon this plan were a ſet of papers written and publiſhed at New-York, in the years 1752, 1753, called the <hi>Independent Reflectors</hi> and <hi>Watch-Towers,</hi> which I ſcarce think it worth while to diſturb in that ſilence wherein they now <hi>rot,</hi> eſpecially as every thing worth notice in them has been haſhed out into <hi>new diſhes,</hi> by the <hi>Centinel,</hi> and will be anſwered in the proper place.</p>
               <p>Soon after the publication of the Independent Reflectors, &amp;c. a hiſtory of New-York was publiſhed by <hi>William Smith,</hi> A. M. in which the old hackneyed charges againſt the ſociety for the propagation of the goſpel were carefully inſerted. No doubt that gentleman imagined that this work (being a hiſtory and quarto volume) might have a greater chance of reaching poſterity than looſe or detached papers; and I am perſuaded he would take it amiſs to have it paſſed over in neglect.

                     <hi>A late writer, in an excellent pamphlet written in anſwer to Mr.</hi> Livingſton<hi>'s letter to the Biſhop of Landaff, has the following juſt remark on Mr. Smith's partiality, "The author, though obliged to plead the indefeaſible right of his profeſſion founded upon immemorable preſcription, for being too verboſe—although his verboſity is diſcovered in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It was more conſiſtent with the apparent deſign of his hiſtory to tell, that "the tops of the pillars that ſupport the galleries in Trinity Church are decked with the gilt buſts of angels winged, and the alleys paved with flat ſtones; than to place good Dr. Barclay's character in a juſt light, or mention his labours and ſucceſs among the Indians." So far this writer—and had Mr.</hi> Smith <hi>only neglected to give Dr. Barclay due praiſe, we ſhould have had leſs to ſay. But the ſociety and Dr. Barclay too were to be charged by this impartial hiſtorian, with neglecting the Indians, perverting their fund, &amp;c. which charge the Centinel repeats, and therefore the ſame anſwer will ſerve for both.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>It is lucky for me on this occaſion that I have nothing to do, but to tranſcribe an anſwer which was prepared for that part of Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s hiſtory, ſoon after its firſt appearance by the late worthy Dr. <hi>Henry Barclay,</hi> Rector of Trinity Church in New-York; who had the beſt opportunities for detecting the particular miſrepreſentations here referred to. It pleaſed God that Dr. <hi>Barclay</hi> did not ſurvive the finiſhing this anſwer long enough to publiſh it, nor was he in any particular haſte about it; but he had intended it for the preſs, ſent a copy to the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ſociety, and another copy to ſome of his brethren in Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania; from which the copy now before me was tranſcribed. I ſhall lay before the reader ſuch extracts from it as ſeem neceſſary in the preſent diſpute: And if what has been inſerted in the two former numbers from my friend <hi>Horatio,</hi> ſhould to any appear too ſevere (though not near ſo ſevere as the provocation given) I am ſure the amiable Chriſtian ſpirit of Dr. <hi>Barclay</hi> will be pleaſing to all, and I think muſt even induce Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to venerate his memory.</p>
               <p>The anſwer of this worthy man begins with a remark (which it is thought will appear juſt in the ſequel) that <q>the author of the hiſtory labours under too great an attachment to a particular ſect to be impartial in his account of the ſtate of religion in America. The great encomiums he, on every
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:011212_0025_0F862CFA267083E0"/>occaſion, paſſes on the miniſters of a certain denomination, his ſilence with regard to thoſe of other churches, except the bare mention of their names, look as though he deſigned to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate a contraſt; and his frequent invectives againſt thoſe of the Church of England are too glaring evidences of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Smith's accounts of the Indian miſſion which are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Doctor's anſwer run thus—<hi>"Nothing to the purpoſe hath yet been attempted in England for the propagation of Chriſtianity among the Indians. Queen Anne ſent a miſſionary among them, and gave him an appointment out of the privy purſe;—the Revd. Mr. Barclay afterward reſided among the Mohawks, but no ſuitable proviſion being made for an interpreter, he was obliged to break up the miſſion."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here ſays the benevolent Dr. Barclay "I find myſelf obliged to undertake a very diſagreeable taſk—the vindication of the ſociety, as well as my own character requiring me to ſay things that would come with much better grace from others. I never thought it becoming me to make a parade of the diſcharge of thoſe things which I was under an indiſpenſible obligation to perform. I have never publiſhed a journal of my miſſion; nor ſhould I have had any occaſion at preſent to give ſo particular an account of my labours among the Mohawks, had this gentleman either done me juſtice or left my name out of his hiſtory. It is well known in this province that I have neither been altogether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs nor unſucceſsful; and that I never alledged the want of a ſuitable proviſion for an interpreter as the reaſon for breaking up the miſſion; a reaſon which I bluſh to think that any perſon ſhould be led to think me capable of aſſigning, after near twelve years reſidence among them. From Mr. Smith's account indeed no perſon, unacquainted with my labours in that miſſion, can conclude that I did any more than make my appearance among the Mohawks, and that the ſociety being unwilling or unable to pay an Interpreter. I left them without effecting or attempting any thing."</p>
               <p>The Doctor then tells us that while he was at College he had formed a reſolution of viſiting the Indians, and to endeavour their converſion; that among others he communicated his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to Mr. Sergeant, then a public tutor in college, and adds (with a candour which Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> does not ſhew to other perſuaſions) "that from that time he entered into a very inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friendſhip with Mr. Sergeant, who had formed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of going among another tribe of Indians; and juſtice (ſays he) requires me to ſay, that Mr. Sergeant was a moſt faithful laborious miſſionary, and his early death juſtly lamented."</p>

               <p>Here we ſee men of the firſt reputation teſtifying that as early as the year 1736, Dr. <hi>Barclay</hi> was able to perform divine ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the Indians in their own tongue. Could one profeſſing to write the hiſtory of his country be ignorant of this teſtimony, or the ſum granted by the aſſembly to reward this worthy man for the pains he had taken to qualify himſelf as an Indian miſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, by acquiring their language? Or what but the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined reſolution to traduce the ſociety and the <hi>Church,</hi> at all hazards, could make Mr. Smith ſay, that after ten years longer reſidence among the Indians "Mr. Barclay was obliged to break up the miſſion, no ſuitable proviſion being made for an interpreter." Impartiality and candor (ſays a writer already quoted concerning this hiſtory) are qualities <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

               <p>In my next I ſhall give the neceſſary extracts from the remainder of the Doctor's anſwer; in which there will appear many more ſtriking proofs of this <hi>Preſbyterian Hiſtorian</hi>'s impartiality and candor towards the <hi>Church.</hi> Nor let the <hi>Centinel</hi> think, all this while, that I am loſing ſight of him. While I am reſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his maſters and predeceſſors, from whom he has copied his ſcandal, I ſhall be making ſome progreſs in the refutation of him. I have been led by a correſpondent a little tour north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, but he may ſee I am now on my return.</p>
               <p>My plan has been conſiſtent, from the beginning; and when I have fully ſhewn who have been the aggreſſors in this diſpute, I ſhall, as I propoſed, enter the liſts with the <hi>Centinel.</hi> Why can he not have a little patience? He was fairly and without interruption heard out his <hi>fifteen</hi> papers. Before I arrive at that number I ſhall certainly take notice of what he calls "the truth and validity of his arguments upon the danger of epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal eſtabliſhments in this new world. And fifty ſuch papers as thoſe of <hi>Irenicus</hi> and the <hi>Anti-Centinel,</hi> ſhall not divert me from my plan. Theſe papers ſhall be noticed in due time if they appear worthy of any; and in the mean while, I would adviſe their author or authors to be very careful of ſetting any more examples of <hi>perſonal</hi> invectives; which, as they have been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto avoided on both ſides, I was in hopes might be avoided to the end of this diſpute; by which means it may be of much ſhorter duration, and that harmony be ſooner reſtored for which <hi>Irenicus</hi> ſo warmly preaches. It is a pity that he had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed his advice on the <hi>Centinel</hi> at the commencement of his papers; but to tell the <hi>Church</hi> now, that ſhe is to bear the whole load of abuſe patiently, and without a reply, can have but little weight; when we find that more than a century's forbearance on her part, has only aggravated the inſolence of her antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts in America.</p>

               <p>Dr. <hi>Barclay</hi> received holy orders, and was appointed to that miſſion in 1737; and ſuppoſing Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> ſo extremely igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the tranſactions of the country whereof he undertakes to write a hiſtory, as not to know that Dr. <hi>Barclay</hi> had, at a provincial expence, ſpent two years in endeavouring to acquire the <hi>Mohawk</hi> language, before he went for orders, and carried home with him a certificate from the commiſſioners for <hi>Indian</hi> affairs, ſetting forth, that he had attained ſuch a knowledge in that language, as to be able to perform divine ſervice in it; yet ſurely the hiſtorian muſt have ſeen the following meſſage from Governor <hi>Clarke</hi> in <hi>December</hi> 1740, from which it would ſeem that the Doctor's labours did not meet with any obſtruction from want of ſkill in the <hi>Indian</hi> language, nor from any other cauſe but that mentioned in the meſſage.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The <hi>Mohawk</hi> ſachems (ſays the Governor to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly) have repreſented to me the irreparable condition of the chapel formerly built for their religious worſhip, and deſiring to have a new one built: I cannot but earneſtly recommend it to you, as a thing worthy the conſideration of a Chriſtian aſſembly. The progreſs already made by the reverend Mr. <hi>Barclay,</hi> opens to our view a glorious proſpect of ſpreading
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:011212_0027_0F862D0142ADDE08"/>the Chriſtian faith and worſhip throughout all the <hi>Six-Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> eſpecially if he be enabled by you to proceed in the work he has ſo happily and ſucceſsfully begun.</q>
               </p>
               <p>"The honourable mention here made of my labours (conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues the Doctor) by the Governor, proceeded from the great ſatisfaction he received in ſeeing the regular and decent beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the <hi>Indians</hi> at public worſhip at <hi>Albany,</hi> where he held a treaty with them. For however unhappily my miſſion ended, I had the pleaſure of ſeeing ſome fruit of my labours 'til the two laſt years. I found them a moſt ignorant ſavage people, ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally addicted to drunkenneſs, that ſcarce a day paſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing ſeveral of them intoxicated, and frequently above three-fourths of them, the women as well as men, fighting and tearing each other like ravenous beaſts. They were in a ſhort time ſo far reclaimed, that I have ſometimes, for two months together, not ſeen above ten of them drunk; and the women, excepting a few of the elder, were wholly reclamed."</p>
               <p>"It is well known that I was ſo univerſally beloved, that I became the umpire of all their differences, and had ſo great an aſcendant over them, that they permitted me to appoint officers to ſeize all ſpirituous liquors that were brought among them for ſale. I found them without the uſe of letters, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering their inſtruction very tedious, obliged me to open a ſchool, teach them to read and write, which I attended ſix hours a day, the two firſt years, with ſuch ſurpriſing ſucceſs, that in about four years from my firſt coming among them, many were able to bear their parts in the Church ſervice with great decency and regularity. Many of them were well advanced in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſtianity; and their attendance and behaviour at public worſhip was matter of reproach to their neighbours, who had enjoyed the light of the goſpel from their infancy, under much greater advantages."</p>
               <p>"Thus I went on, encouraged with a moſt pleaſing proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of ſeeing the riſing generation a very regular and ſerious Chriſtian congregation; and, at the ſame time, had the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of preaching once every Lord's day to a conſiderable <hi>Engliſh</hi> congregation, and ſometimes to a much larger of <hi>Low-Dutch,</hi> whoſe language I was well verſed in. But, to my great grief and mortification, theſe pleaſing hopes were ſoon cut off. A ſtrange jealouſy was infuſed into the poor <hi>Indians,</hi> a little before the breaking out of the laſt <hi>French</hi> war, by a very wicked and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious perſon, of which I gave the Society an account. Upon this I found their regard and affection for me ſenſibly diminiſhing till the latter end of the year 1744; when, in the dead of night, the <hi>Indians</hi> were alarmed with a pretended diſcovery of a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:011212_0028_0F862D0211A3A000"/>plot to murder them all, of which I was repreſented as the chief contriver. This would have coſt me my life in the rage of their firſt reſentments, had not ſome of the more intelligent among them, as they afterwards confeſſed, prevented it. The particulars of this affair I alſo gave the Society an account of at the time when it happened, and they are alſo very well known to the honourable Mr. <hi>Clinton,</hi> who was at that time Governor of <hi>New York.</hi> I continued after this, near fifteen months, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>"Theſe were the reaſons of my leaving the <hi>Indians,</hi> and not the want of a ſuitable proviſion for an interpreter —From whom Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> had his information concerning the reaſon of my breaking up my miſſion, I know not; but he has been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with me upwards of ten years laſt paſt, and might have ſeen me almoſt every day during that time. In the note under the forty ſecond page, he gives an account of the "extreme mortification, inextinguiſhable zeal, and great ſucceſs of Mr. <hi>David Brainerd,</hi> a late miſſionary from the <hi>Scotch</hi> Society, among ſome <hi>Indians</hi> in <hi>New Jerſey, not one of whom,</hi> he tells us, has been concerned in thoſe barbarous irruptions which have lately deluged the ſouth-weſtern provinces with the blood of ſeveral hundred innocents of every age and ſex." And concludes this note in the following words. "Dr. <hi>Douglaſs,</hi> ever ready to do honour to his native country, after remarking that this ſelf-denying clergyman rode about 400 miles in the year 1744, with an air of approbation aſks, is there any miſſionary from any of the Societies for propagating the goſpel in foreign parts, that has reported the like?</p>
               <p>"As to Mr. <hi>Brainord's</hi> mortification and zeal, every good man muſt approve and commend theſe virtues wherever they are found, and I hope he is now reaping the glorious rewards of them. As to his ſucceſs, <hi>tho' Paul plant, and Apollos wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is God</hi> alone that gives the increaſe. I heartily wiſh I could ſay that I had heard thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> continue the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſociety of Chriſtians ſince his death.

                     <hi>This was the caſe at the time of Dr.</hi> Barclay<hi>'s writing. But Mr.</hi> Brainerd, <hi>the brother, ſince had, and now has, I believe, ſome</hi> Jerſey Indians <hi>under his paſtoral care, and his labours among them are well reported of.</hi>

                  <pb n="55" facs="unknown:011212_0028_0F862D0211A3A000"/>"With regard to myſelf, I confeſs that I might have been more mortified, more zealous and induſtrious than I have been; and I pray God to pardon my defects. However bleſſed be his goodneſs, which has enabled me to ſay, that I have not been altogether deſtitute of theſe virtues, ſo indiſpenſably neceſſary to an <hi>Indian</hi> miſſionary. And tho' I never reported the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of miles I have rode in the diſcharge of my miſſion, hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds can atteſt that it was many more than 400 every year. And much more is done by ſeveral miſſionaries in the Society's ſervice. As to Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s remark on that happy effect of Mr. <hi>Brainerd</hi>'s miſſion, viz. "That <hi>not one of thoſe Indians</hi> have been concerned in thoſe barbarous irruptions, &amp;c. I am perſuaded ſome prejudice muſt have prevented his making the ſame obſervations with regard to the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> as it is moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious that they have not only been inoffenſive, but are the only tribe of the Confederates that have openly joined us, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended our armies in the preſent war."</p>
               <p>"But how comes every favourable circumſtance that may redound either to the credit of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Society, or their miſſionaries, to be thus paſſed over in ſilence by this impartial hiſtorian, and whence all thoſe inſinuations to their diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage?" The Doctor gives the ſame reaſon that has already been advanced; namely, that the intention of all theſe miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the Society, and their conduct, is to dry up the chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they receive from benevolent minds in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and thus to reduce the intereſt of the Church to as low an ebb as poſſible in the colonies.</p>
               <p>But not content "with paſſing over in ſilence what might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the credit of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Society, and their miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries," this hiſtorian, in the abundance of his ſpleen, does not ſcruple ſometimes to <hi>invent,</hi> rather than fail in, charges againſt them.</p>

                  <q>The Epiſcopal miſſionaries (ſays he, page 42) for enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the ſphere of their ſecular buſineſs, not many years ago, attempted, by a <hi>petition</hi> to the late Governor <hi>Clinton,</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſs the privilege of ſolemnizing all marriages. A <hi>great clamour</hi> enſued, and the attempt was abortive.</q>—</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Barclay</hi> ſhews this whole paragraph to be an abſolute falſhood. He appeals to Governor <hi>Clinton,</hi> and all concerned in the government, whether any ſuch attempt was ever made, directly or indirectly, or any ſuch petition ever preſented? as to the <hi>great clamour</hi> ſaid to enſue, he appeals to the whole province (Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> excepted) whether any ſuch clamour was ever heard?</p>
               <p>"I can ſpeak (ſays he) with certainty, as Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> fixes the time of this imaginary attempt to Governor <hi>Clinton</hi>'s ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, and not many years ago—Now the petition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented

                     <hi>It is told of the late Biſhop</hi> Sherlock, <hi>that when he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that the juſtices celebrated marriages from this plea, of their being Proteſtant miniſters of juſtice, replied in his blunt way—"and ſo may the</hi> hangman, <hi>he being alſo a Proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant miniſter of juſtice.</hi>"</note> Proteſtant miniſters, and capable of executing the licence. The <hi>prayer</hi> of the clergy therefore was, that an addition might be made to the future direction of licences thus, <hi>viz.</hi> "To any <hi>Proteſtant miniſter of the goſpel</hi> (Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> ſays, not very accurately— "To all Proteſtant miniſters of the goſpel")—The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor complied with this requeſt, and far from raiſing any cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, the meaſure was greatly approved by

                     <hi>The like alteration was made by Governor</hi> Franklin, <hi>ſome years ago, in the direction of his licences, on an application of the Epiſcopal clergy of</hi> New-jerſey, <hi>and the Preſbyterians were well pleaſed with it.</hi>
                  </note> the clergy of all other denominations, who reaped, proportionably, far more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit from it than the Epiſcopal clergy."</p>
               <p>But it was of little conſequence to this hiſtorian, whether the Epiſcopal clergy did well or ill. For in the temper with which he wrote, obloquy and miſrepreſentation were to be their portion. And yet if ever his hiſtory ſhould come to a ſecond edition, charity would make one hope, that more years, with better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and enquiry, may releaſe him from ſome of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, and make him appear with that dignity as a hiſtorian, which his compoſition, and confeſſed abilities, might otherwiſe give him ſome title to hold.</p>
               <p>But the party did not chooſe to truſt their cauſe long to this <hi>hiſtory.</hi> For finding, probably, that it ſoon began to ſhare the fate of many other <hi>mortal</hi> compoſitions, namely, to reſt harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs on its ſhelf, the ball was ſtill to be kept up againſt the Church; as if it were by alternate blows from Preſbyterian and Independent.</p>

Or is it unmeritted abuſe of the Church of England, to ſay that her courts acted after this manner? But the old Puritans, comprehending under that name Preſbyterians, Independents, Baptiſt, &amp;c. felt theſe ſevere perſecutions for non-conformity to the eſtabliſhed Church of England, through the long reigns of Elizabeth and of James, before the Quakers became a religious ſociety in England. And they were all as ſeverely handred as theſe Quaker ſufferers, from the reſtoration till the glorious revolution.

They have ſtruggled hard for an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in North-Carolina, and are oppreſſing that poor colony with new taxes from time to time for purchaſing glebes, building churches, and parſonage houſes, for the ſupport of their clergy, though the number of that church be ſmall, in compariſon of other ſocieties. And this unwearied induſtry we may expect in all the colonies, to bring North-America every where to pay tribute to hungry ambitious miſſionaries. The Preſbyterians, in theſe provinces, deſire no eſtabliſhments, they rather think them hurtful to religion, yet they that claim them, and pant for them, and are willing to move heaven and earth for them, charge this as a crime on their innocent neighbours; but this abuſive writer cares not what he affirms, nor on what foundation, and if perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution <hi>to blood ſtriving</hi> muſt be our lot, if we ſtrive to prevent ſuch oppreſſion, we hope we ſhall be armed with Chriſtian pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and fortitude, to do or ſuffer according to the will of GOD. We deſire no union with him, or any other ſociety, to do miſchief, nay we abhor it. We neither deſire nor expect the <hi>attachment of Churchmen,</hi> nor any of the human race, unleſs for good purpoſes, for the defence of our country in their juſt rights and privileges, and the common good of all men. But we would aſk this bluſtering writer, Have all Churchmen, as he calls them, given him a commiſſion to abuſe and threaten their neighbours? Or is he ſuperior to Dr. Chandler, who is blamed by him for ſpeaking for them without authority? When Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians are ſlighted in general, and we hear great encomiums given to Epiſcopacy, as a national church, we muſt remind this writer, that neither of theſe names can warrant men to do miſchief; and that either or both derive their honour from obeying the goſpel, and following the example of CHRIST, and not from worldly pomp or grandeur; CHRIST's kingdom is not of this world. But if eſtabliſhments, or national churches, make Chriſtians more venerable; the Preſbyterians or Reformed are one of the three religious perſuaſions eſtabliſhed by law in the German Empire. It is one of the two religious perſuaſions eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in Switzerland; it is the national religion of Holland and Geneva; and the national church of Scotland is Preſbyterian; but all the miniſters of theſe churches, with all the Lutheran miniſters of Sweden, Denmark, and the German Empire, are rejected as unworthy the name of goſpel miniſters by this bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:011212_0031_0F862D03E6E35E38"/>of the reformation, this mirror of charity, which is itſelf confined to the narrow bounds of Ireland and England. And let it be for ever remembered, for the honour of Preſbyterians, here called a ſour intolerant party, that univerſal liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience was firſt proclaimed and eſtabliſhed among Proteſtants in the national church of Holland, where men and women, perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted by both Proteſtants and Papiſts, found a ſure aſſylum, and a city of refuge. The Centinel equally pleaded the common cauſe of all other denominations, and the Preſhyterians here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed, owe him no more thanks than are due to him by all that dread a yoke of bondage, that neither we nor our fathers could bear, and if he be cut up while aſleep, and even devoured by this ſecond Polypheme, we hope there will be men found to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate Preſbyterians, and to defend the common cauſe of civil and religious liberty; but as champions and ſtrong men are ſaid to be merciful, we have hopes that the Centinel may yet eſcape his bloody knife and perform his duty.</p>

               <p>I was obſerving, in the concluſion of my laſt number, that it ſeems to have been a ſettled agreement between <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> and <hi>Independents,</hi> that the Church in America ſhould ſuffer no reſt, but ſtill be purſued by them, as it were by alternate attacks and fury.

               <p>And now, Mr. <hi>Centinel,</hi> what think you of your maſter <hi>Mayhew?</hi> Have you ſuch a grand flight in all your work as this, viz. <hi>that your good party is the flying</hi> Woman, <hi>and the Church and Biſhop the purſuing</hi> Serpent? Why could you not, when retailing Dr. <hi>Mayhew,</hi> give us ſome of his beſt touche? But perhaps he did not ſuit you in every thing. For, furious as he is in certain places, he has ſpoilt the whole by conceſſions in other places. Although he belabours the ſociety ſo vehemently, and preſents them with the guilt of <hi>Annanias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira,</hi> yet (good man) he declares it <q>by no means his intention to charge that venerable body with any wilful known miſconduct, or <hi>impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per applications of Monies,</hi> even though any incautious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion ſhould at firſt view have that appearance.</q> For no one, he ſays, "whoever read their <hi>charter,</hi> can poſſibly ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine

               <p>Amazing this! Though there is leſs religion in New-England, than if the ſociety's money had been ſunk in the ocean, yet he does not charge them with improper application of their money —Though he has deſcribed Biſhops as monſters, yet he has no fault to find with thoſe that have lived ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This laſt Paragraph I copy from an anſwer given to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in his life time. For although moſt of the attacks made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Church in America, before the Doctor's publication, were ſuffered to paſs unnoticed; yet, as by theſe conceſſions which he made here and there, when his raging fits were a little off, he appeared to be under ſome compunctions of mind, that might at length open him to conviction; it was judged that an anſwer in the ſpirit of moderation and truth might not be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thrown away upon him, this anſwer was marked in every line with that benevolence of temper, that force of argument, that amiable decorum and yet dignity of expreſſion, which cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterized an Illuſtrious Prelate lately deceaſed, to whom it hath been generally aſcribed—I mean the great and good Archbiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op <hi>Secker</hi>—at mention of whole name, every true ſon of the <hi>Church,</hi> every lover of primitive integrity, piety and unaffected ſimplicity of manners, muſt drop a tear, as for a father loſt!</p>

                  <pb n="65" facs="unknown:011212_0033_0F862D08ADD12BF8"/>Rude as the Doctor's attack on the Church was; although (as he confeſſes in his ſecond piece) his expreſſions were "too harſh and irritating," yet the anſwerer never forgets himſelf or his own character. He calmly tells him, that—"if mitres offend him, our Biſhops wear none—if they are ſtyled Lords, it is becauſe, by the antient conſtitution of our country, they ſit in the upper houſe of Parliament; and adds (what he ſtill farther proved by his own example) "that men may be <hi>Lords</hi> without being <hi>lordly."</hi>" As to <hi>fiſhermen of Galilee,</hi> the anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſays that he cannot tell whether the Doctor means "that all miniſters of Chriſt ſhould follow ſome trade, nor whether he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows any himſelf—but that reviling his brethren is certainly a very bad one."—</p>
               <p>As to the charge of perſecution, our anſwerer obſerves, "that the lawfulneſs of it is no doctrine of the <hi>Church</hi>— that diſſenters did not ſuffer their hardſhips in England on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their religious tenets, but becauſe, in general, their avowed aim, was not an exemption for themſelves, but the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſhment—that on this, they were treated too ſeverely, and they returned the treatment to the full, as ſoon as they were able, in the total overthrow of Church and ſtate." He puts them in mind of the doctrine held by the New-England platform, "that <hi>hereſy is to be reſtrained and puniſhed by the civil magiſtrate</hi>"—a doctrine which without an <hi>eſtabliſhment</hi> has been more rigorouſly carried into execution in that country, than ever it was by the Church at home—for the confirmation of which, the teſtimony of a third party is appealed to, namely the <hi>Quakers;</hi> who affirm, <hi>that they who had loudly cried out of the tyranny and oppreſſion of the Biſhops in old England, from whom they fled, when ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in a place where they had liberty to govern, made their lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle finger of cruelty bigger than ever they ſound the loins of the biſhops</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But I diſmiſs this charge of perſecution for the preſent, which (on account of ſome old miſtakes that are to be lamented on both ſides) is ſtill unjuſtly kept up againſt one o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The anſwerer to Doctor <hi>Mayhew,</hi> afterwards proceeds to the charge repeated from Mr. <hi>Smith</hi>'s hiſtory (which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready taken notice of) that Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi>'s miſſion was <hi>ſtarved</hi> for want of ſupport, and broken up for want of an interprete<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi> himſelf declares that when he came to his miſſion, "he found the ſociety at all times, anxiouſly ſolicitous to encourage him; that they readily conſented to the eſtabliſhment of two Indian ſchools; that they ordered him to employ an <hi>interpreter.</hi>" (not indeed to interpret in his <hi>preaching,</hi> but to aſſiſt in the inſtruction of the youth;) "but that the old <hi>interpreter</hi> being dead, he could never meet with any other qualified for the office; that his ſubſiſtance was comfortable; that he never broke up his miſſion on account of any backwardneſs of the venerable ſociety to ſupport him; but from an unavoidable neceſſity, on account of baſe, inſinuations infuſed by an ill deſigning party into the minds of the Indians, juſt before the breaking out of the French war"—All which, both Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> and Dr, <hi>Mayhew</hi> muſt have well known. And here I hope the reader will not think I have dwelt too long on theſe particulars; for they are material to ſhew what ſpirit the antagoniſts of the Church have, and to what ſhifts they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, in ſeeking matter to vilify her.</p>
               <p>The anſwerer to Dr. <hi>Mayhew</hi> proceeds farther, to inform him of all the pains and expence of the ſociety, in eſtabliſhing many Indian miſſions which he deigns not to take notice of, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the Doctor's own words, the <hi>great diſcouragements that have been and ſtill are in attempting to Chriſtianize the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians.</hi>"—Diſcouragements which all ſides muſt labour with, till God's own time comes for converting them, and till he finds inſtruments worthy of this great honour. Till then, neither ſide ſhould reproach the other for want of that ſucceſs which God alone can give. There are now large funds in the hands of the Preſbyterians and Independents themſelves, expreſsly for Indian miſſions; and I wiſh there never may be more cauſe to reproach them with negligence in the execution of their truſt, or perverſion of the fund there has been to reproach the truly venerable ſociety.</p>
               <p>The next endeavour of Dr. <hi>Mayhew</hi>'s anſwerer, is to quiet his apprehenſions about American Biſhops—But the <hi>Centinel</hi> thinks that he himſelf is the man that has hit upon the true <hi>valid</hi> arguments againſt an American epiſcopate, and it ſeems would be very angry if the anſwer was addreſſed to any body but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Now although I can ſee nothing in the Centinel but what is better ſaid by his predeceſſor, I ſhall indulge him in what he deſires, if not to his ſatisfaction, yet I hope to the ſatisfaction, of all impartial men.</p>

               <head>From the PENNSYLVANIA JOURNAL, Oct, 20. THE REMONSTRANT, No. III.</head>
               <p>THAT there is a project on foot to eſtabliſh Biſhops in America, is publickly avowed and contended for by many of the epiſcopal Church; and they as confidently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that they are part of the Engliſh eſtabliſhed Church, and that all others are Diſſenters. But as an epiſcopate with its ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical courts and other appendages has in former times been found hurtful to other religious ſocieties, the plan now propoſed is repreſented in ſuch a favourable view, as, in their judgment, no reaſonable man can object to it. For theſe Biſhops are to have no powers but what are purely ſpiritual. They are only to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, confirm and inſpect the morals of the clergy of their own denomination. Had twenty ſuch Biſhops been ſent to America, provided they had no connection with our <hi>civil affairs,</hi> nor a <hi>proſpect</hi> of being <hi>able</hi> to <hi>claim</hi> or <hi>exerciſe</hi> the powers that made them terrible in England, no man had been uneaſy about them. But for many reaſons already offered on this ſubject, all the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies have juſt grounds to fear that the epiſcopate really deſired, and which will be eſtabliſhed, if ever any be eſtabliſhed among us, will not be ſo harmleſs and innocent as they pretend, nor ſo like thoſe that were in the primitive Church. Even Doctor Chandler, who ſo ſtrongly aſſerts that they deſire no power that can be hurtful to the civil or religious rights and privileges of other denominations, paints his intended Biſhops in ſuch colours as muſt ſtrike all conſiderate perſons with terror, and convince them that if Biſhops be once eſtabliſhed, they will oblige thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands once more to ſeek ſhelter among the ſavage Indians,</p>
               <p>But for want of arguments to refute Doctor Chauncy, the Centinel, Whig, and others who have pointed out our danger; and with a view to turn the public attention from this avowed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of an eſtabliſhment ſo dreadful in its conſequences, the Anatomiſt cries aloud that the colonies are in danger from a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian eſtabliſhment, which, as he alledges, is projected and carrying into execution.</p>
               <p>"This four turbulent party, ſays he, have juſtly alarmed the fear of every other religious perſuaſion in America, and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated a jealouſy that the ſole view of this party is to erect an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire and eſtabliſhment for themſelves in this new world, on the ruin of every other religious denomination. But before they can ſucceed in their deſigns, they will meet with a reſiſtance
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:011212_0035_0F862D0ACE1BD100"/>far different from what is to be expected in this paper; a reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance perhaps even unto <hi>blood.</hi> That the epiſcopal Churches have an eſtabliſhment in Maryland and Virginia, and the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents (as he calls them) have a ſort of eſtabliſhment in ſome of the New-England provinces is well known. But a Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian eſtabliſhment in the colonies is neither projected nor deſired, nor can it ever be attempted with any rational proſpect of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. No denominations of Chriſtians in any of the other colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, the epiſcopalians only excepted, have the leaſt ground to expect it.

                  </gap>ees, who are all of that perſuaſion; but no act paſſed in the colonies to eſtabliſh Preſbytery, or any religious perſuaſion, (epiſcopacy excepted) on the ruins of other ſocieties, would obtain a ſanction in England. It would be madneſs to attempt it, Nay the Lutheran and Preſbyterian ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties in New-York could not procure even a charter in England for ſecuring their churches and burying grounds. Letters of incorporation, ſuch as are granted to almoſt every com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of mechanicks, were denied them by the interpoſition of gentlemen of the epiſcopal eſtabliſhment, and in particular by one of their Biſhops, as we are informed. With what face then can the Anatomiſt alarm the world with the notion of a Preſbyterian eſtabliſhment, a thing in itſelf not only improbable, but even impoſſible; we utterly deny this charge; It is a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs calumny, without the leaſt foundation; and we call on this abuſive writer either to make good his aſſertion, or to take to himſelf the ſhame of publiſhing notorious falſhoods, for want of better arguments; but this he did to amuſe other religious ſocieties, and to turn their attention from the common danger.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe, for argument ſake, that this eſtabliſhment was projected, is this a good reaſon why the Anatomiſt ſhould ſhake his bloody knife, and puff and abuſe the Presbyterians? Is it a ſufficient reaſon to threaten then, with a reſiſtance far different from what is in his paper, poſſibly he intends proſecutions, and fines, and impriſonments, and baniſhment, and confiſcation of goods as in old times. Is every attempt to have an eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſufficient provocation to <hi>reſiſt even unto blood.</hi> Let us then turn his arguments againſt himſelf, and aſk what ſhould other ſocieties do to prevent an epiſcopal eſtabliſhment, that dreadful evil, ſo ruinous to every other religious denomination, when it comes to be determined that it ſhall take place among us. Are we accuſed and threatened for writing againſt it, and pointing out the direful conſequences of a well-known eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

He and his party threaten to <hi>ſtrive</hi> even to blood, to prevent a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian eſtabliſhment, which is impoſſible to accompliſh; and yet he will not allow others even to lament their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from his projected, and almoſt executed eſtabliſhment, nor to complain that they are in danger. All denominations are loudly or humbly to petition thoſe that are in power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to prevent this evil. But how muſt the world deteſt a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting Church, or a Churchman threatning blood and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to any that would aim at an eſtabliſhment, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ough it be a thing that he, and almoſt all epiſcopalians contend for, as for a bleſſing to a religious ſociety. This is not the Chriſtian ſpirit; this is not to obey his commands, who enjoins us to do to others as we would be done by.</p>
               <p>The Centinel was as much an advocate for every ſociety in the colonies as the Presbyterians, yet they and the New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Independents only muſt bear the laſh of this writer. What has the New-England Independents to do with this controverſy? If they dealt hardly by the miſſionaries or the people of their perſuation, we would by no means vindicate them, but will this pretended abuſe warrant Epiſcopalian, to unite in England and America, once more to harraſs the world with their eccleſiaſtical courts? If the firſt ſettlers in New-England were unfriendly to the Epiſcopalians and other denominations, they imported the bitter root of perſecution and intolerance, and a love of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious eſtabliſhments from England to Boſton, and under theſe unhappy prejudices enacted, that other denominations ſhould contribute to the ſupport of the eſtabliſhed or town miniſter: This crying iniquity was done, and ſtill is done in England be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the face of all Iſrael, and in the face of the ſun. For there all other denominations muſt, and do maintain the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed clergy. But when the Epiſcopalians had their own meaſures returned, what clamours did they raiſe? What cries of injuſtice and oppreſſion? The biſhops and zealous highfliers interpoſed for their relief, and the New-England Independents were told, that notwithſtanding their acts of aſſembly, every denomination muſt maintain their own clergy. And this juſt and equitable determination, beyond the Atlantic, we, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents themſelves highly approve; but is this equity and juſtice obſerved in Old England, where near a million of Diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers muſt maintain the eſtabliſhed clergy? Is this equity and juſtice regarded in the epiſcopal colonies, as in Maryland or Virginia? Or is this equity and juſtice obſerved in North Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:011212_0036_0F862D0B246F4928"/>where Governor Dobbs obtained ſevere and oppreſſive laws to maintain the epiſcopal clergy? In theſe caſes there are no cries of injuſtice, no advocates to plead the cauſe of other ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties, that are burdened and oppreſſed. And all ſuch acts, when once confirmed in England, are not likely ever to be repealed. The Independents in New-England were led by the practices and laws of Old England to treat Diſſenters from their eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment ſuch as it was, in the ſame manner the epiſcopalians did, and ſtill do treat Diſſenters from their religious eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Of all men in the world they ſhould be the laſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn others, for what they juſtify in themſelves. We condemn all perſecution ſeverity and injuſtice in all eſtabliſhments, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Roman Catholic, Epiſcopal, Independent, or Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. But what have we to do with theſe affairs in New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, or with their preſent debate with the miſſionaries? Is it an attack on the Church of England, to diſpute with a few of her miſſionaries; or is it unlawful to write againſt her bigotted ſons, who contend for an unbroken ſucceſſion, a divine right of epiſcopacy, and other chimaeras that are deſpiſed by the beſt and moſt moderate part of that Church? Are her miſſionaries ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred that all Presbyterians in America muſt be abuſed, becauſe Mr. Smith, a Presbyterian hiſtorian, has omitted to give one of them a full compliment of praiſes? What have all theſe tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles to do with the preſent diſpute? They ſolve none of our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections; they are only deſigned to draw our attention from a gathering ſtorm, ready to burſt on us and deſtroy us.</p>
               <p>Eccleſiaſtical courts like a furious wild beaſt are at preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der reſtraints, but are not tamed. They have in ſome degree maintained their influence, even under the milder adminiſtration, ſince the glorious revolution; and if an epiſcopate be here eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, we fear they will rage with ſeven ſold ſury. One great reaſon of our fear, ariſes from the nature and conſtitution of theſe colonies. In England, the nobility in general hate op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and have on many occaſions checked the exorbitant power of eccleſiaſticks, and delivered their friends, tenants and religious ſocieties, from perſecution. The judges in England, are men of great reputation and influence; they are raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the frowns of the proudeſt eccleſiaſticks, nay they are ſet above the pride or malice even of the King's miniſters, that they may without danger, adhere to the laws, and defend the rights of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> people. They are empowered to grant, and do frequently grant prohibitions to check the tyranny, and to ſtop the rigour of the biſhops courts. But ſhould epiſcopacy with its courts be here eſtabliſhed, (and that they certainly will be eſtabliſhed is what we fear) we have no powerful nobility to
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:011212_0036_0F862D0B246F4928"/>check their rage, no independent judges eſtabliſhed for life to interpoſe and deliver us. A judge, or even a governor in the colonies, would be treated with inſolence and abuſe, that would appear againſt the oppreſſion of any of our proud unmerciful prelates, moſt bitter complaints of his conduct would be made to the Arch-biſhops and Biſhops and the King's miniſters. He would be traduced as a republican, an enemy to the church of England, and to his Majeſty's government in the colonies and to Monarchy itſelf. The old cry would be raiſed again, no Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, no King, and poſſibly the offender, whether Judge or Governor, would be rumbled down with diſgrace from his ſtation, and made an example to all who would not bow down their necks, to our American Biſhops. Let me on this occaſion, uſe the words of the Anatomiſts, <hi>O my children, on the proſpect of this change, how I tremble and lament for you!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How carefully has the Anatomiſt raked up every thing to blacken the Independents in New England; even the Boſton Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nack is preſſed into his ſervice. But do theſe ſhifts and evaſions ſatisfy any reaſonable man, that the intended epiſcopate will not be hurtful to other religious ſocieties? or that it will not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce confuſion, into our civil courts, and overturn many of our laws? Does a ſtory of Independent Reflectors, and Watch Towers, or of a Hiſtorian, that did not extol one of their Miſſionaries as much as he deſerved and expected, prove that the Presbyterians are labouring for an eſtabliſhment? Our granting that they were, which is a notorious falſhood, would that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us that our civil and religious liberties were in no danger from the intended epiſcopate and its eccleſiaſtical courts? If he thinks it any advantage to his cauſe, to mention the faults of Presbyterians and Independents, who were ever as moderate in the exerciſe of power as the church of England; we are ready to balance accounts with him, and our accounts of the ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Highfliers in the church of England, and their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere acts of Parliament to diſtreſs all non conformiſts, ſhall not be taken from almanacks, pamplets, or unprinted hiſtories, but from Hiſtorians of undoubted Authority and good reputation.

               </epigraph>
               <p>IT was hinted in my introductory number, that "in the character of the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> which the <hi>Centinel</hi> and his aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates have drawn, they have been combating a phantom of their own brain;" and, therefore, I ſhould have conſidered them in the caſe of the <hi>maſtiffs</hi> mentioned in my <hi>motto,</hi> viz. as "amuſing themſelves about a <hi>ſheep-ſkin</hi> ſtuffed with hay," pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they had not fallen foul of the <hi>flock,</hi> and attacked the whole body of the Churh, her doctrine, and diſcipline, and the principles of her clergy and members. For what leſs can be meant by aſſerting, <q>that the pure word of God is corrupted and obſcured among us with human inventions; and that our clergy are exerting their utmoſt influence in conjunction with Mr. Grenville, to enſlave America; that the Biſhop we want, would be dangerous to liberty,</q>—and ſuch like expreſſions, fairly quoted from the Centinel?</p>
               <p>It was obſerved in the ſecond number, "that the common apology made by the <hi>Centinel</hi>'s adherents, for this illiberal and unmanly abuſe of the Church, is, that Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi> was the ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor." But to this it was anſwered, and no one hath offered to deny the truth of the aſſertion,—"that Doctor <hi>Chandler</hi> far from being an aggreſſor, hath not uttered a ſingle word, in his whole performance, reflecting on the principles of any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant perſuaſion of men; and therefore nothing done by him could be the leaſt plea for an attack on the Church in general."</p>
               <p>That this matter might be more clear to every impartial rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I have even gone more than a century back and have ſhewn that the oppoſition to the Church of England in America, on the part of the Presbyterians and Independents, has been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on through that long period of time, with ſuch uniformity of bitterneſs, and inextinguiſhable malignity, as could flow from nothing leſs than a rooted deſire of cruſhing the Church wholly on this continent, for the ſake of erecting an excluſive dominion of their own.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="unknown:011212_0037_0F862D0BE649AE78"/>Some inſtances, out of many, have been given, of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian endeavours to prevent his Majeſty's good ſubjects ſettled among them from enjoying the free exerciſe of that mode of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious worſhip which their conſciences directed them to follow. Some inſtances have alſo been given, of the ſhameful falſhoods and illiberal abuſe conſtantly propagated againſt the ſociety and members of the Church at home, for reaching out their charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hand to the aſſiſtance of diſperſed congregations of their brethren in America. And to the whole have been added ſome examples of the hideous characters in which the Church, her Biſhops &amp;c. have been painted, as purſuing ſchemes danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to American liberty, and the like; all which our antagoniſts help out with prayers, as well in their publications as pulpits, that Biſhops may never get footing here, nor the <hi>Church gain ground to any great degree</hi>—a conduct too evidently calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to prejudice and enflame the minds of their followers, not only againſt their <hi>epiſcopal</hi> brethren in America, but (I wiſh it could not be ſaid) to alienate their affections from the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mother country. Nay, ſo far gone are they in their domineering uncharitable ſpirit, that even our ſecret wiſhes are conſtrued into crimes; and our humble <hi>petitions</hi> to our ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and ſuperiors in the Church, <hi>praying</hi> that we may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>admitted to the natural rights enjoyed by all other religious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties, are ſaid to be deep laid plots, ready to break forth into every evil, political and religious, which their <hi>fertile</hi> imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can invent.</p>
               <p>This is no exaggerated account of the treatment which the Church hath met with in America; but is much ſhort of what might have been ſaid under this head.
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>In the review of the treatment which the Church hath met with from different writers in America, I have for the ſake of brevity, omitted the virulent pieces of</hi> Hobart, <hi>and many others, in Connecticut, as well as in Maſſachuſetts, and other northern governments.

               <p>It is therefore ſubmitted to the impartial world to declare, whether.

Doctor <hi>Chandler</hi> declared this to be the deſign of his Appeal, and tells the world, that, "as ſome perſons were ſaid to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed at the application made by the clergy in ſeveral colonies for one or more Biſhops to be ſent to America, he thought it proper to ſhew <hi>candidly</hi> and <hi>explicitly</hi> for what reaſons this appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation had been made, and that no invaſion of the civil or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious privileges of any, whether Churchmen or Diſſenters, was thereby intended. And if any thing ſhould appear to be leſs fitly ſpoken, or not clearly evidenced, he requeſts notice of it in a charitable and Chriſtian way, declaring farther, "that the perſon who ſhould act thus to him, ſhould be as welcome to him as an angel of God, ſent to conduct him from the lanes of error into the open ways of truth?"</p>
               <p>But has the <hi>Centinel</hi> acted like this angel of God? Or rather hath he not acted, (let the impartial world ſay) like an angel of a different complexion, in turning from a charitable and Chriſtian anſwer to Dr. <hi>Chandler,</hi> into a moſt uncharitable and unchriſtian attack of the whole body of the Church, whereof he is a Member? The <hi>Doctor</hi> had a number of antagoniſts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him from the northern governments, who were boaſted to be more than his match. What need then of our Centinel's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfering, unleſs it was to ſhew his pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Or was it intended, by bringing the diſpute into this ſouthern latitude, to make the world believe that the northern <hi>contagion</hi> and intolerant raving againſt epiſcopacy, was become general through all <hi>America?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which ever of theſe was our Centinel's motive, he muſt now take the conſequences; for having, I think, fully finiſhed the firſt head, and ſhewn that Dr. Chandler was not an aggreſſor in this diſpute, much leſs any member of the Church in Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania. I ſhall come to cloſe quarters with the <hi>Centinel.</hi> But I own myſelf at ſome loſs how to deal with ſuch an eccentric ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary—for, as Monſieur Bayle obſerves upon the like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; it is like hunting a <hi>duck,</hi> which as ſoon as you think you have her, dives down, and leaves you ſtaring about to ſee where ſhe will pop up again.

               <p>But I muſt do as well as I can, and, as "the truth and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity af his arguments, upon the danger of epiſcopal eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in America," ſeem to be his main fort, I ſhall ſtrive there to ſtorm him in my next number.</p>

The hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> is part of the hiſtory of the nation, and where ſhe hath done amiſs, the Quakers can as well diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh as the <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> or any of his party; and therefore, he will not be able to tell <hi>them</hi> or <hi>us</hi> any thing that is new.

                  <p>The petition I mean, is that of the Quakers, to <hi>Charles</hi> II. 1669, complaining of the intolerable perſecutions they ſuffered by the <hi>ſanguinary</hi> laws of <hi>New-England;</hi> when, after enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating ſome of their ſufferings under <hi>Cromwell's</hi> uſurpation, they proceed thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And now, O King, ſince the very day the Lord brought thee into thy land again, and gave thee thy land again, and gave thee thy regal power, have they in thy name, made ſtrange and cruel havock of thy true ſubjects, in putting to death and baniſhing: And in thy name, with many torturing whippings of old and young at poſts, and at wheels of great guns, and at carts tails, dragging the naked bodies of parents and children through divers long towns, through the filth and dirt of their channels and cart-ways. And in thy name com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding one friend and brother to help to impriſon the other, yea in thy name they have lately preſſed the ſon to help to force his tender father and mother to goal, ſundry miles, in the extremity of the winter ſeaſon, to the hazard of their lives: And ſuch as refuſed to obey their unnatural and abominable commands, they have fined at their courts.—And thus from court to court do theſe monſters of men, In thy name, fine, impriſon, and break open the houſes of the people called <hi>Quakers,</hi> and rob them of their goods, and take away that they ſhould eat in, and that they ſhould drink in, yea, the very clothes from their backs in the winter, and the bed they lie on, while they keep the body ſundry miles off in priſon; driving huſbands and wives to priſon in times of great froſt and ſnow keeping them cloſe priſoners to the endangering of their lives, and to the ruin of their families, had not the LORD preſerved them. All this, and much more, have they done to the ſervants of the LORD in <hi>New-England</hi> in thy name, ſaying that thou owneſt their doings and eſteemeſt their

               <p>I come now to that part of my undertaking, in which the <hi>Centinel</hi>'s adherents )by their repeated challenges) ſeem to think I ſhall be chiefly preſſed.—I mean, in anſwering his arguments "on the danger of introducing (or, as they phraſe it, <hi>importing</hi>) a Biſhop, or Biſhops to <hi>America.</hi>"—And, I confeſs, I have no ſmall difficulties to encounter with. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt, What he ſays on this head lies ſo ſcattered through his different papers, that, after wading through all of them, I
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:011212_0040_0F862D0E226EC9F0"/>find it almoſt impoſſible to ſort what I glean up, into any kind of form or connection.</p>

               </p>
               <p>It would, indeed, be a pleaſure, while we claim what we think a <hi>natural right,</hi> to be inſtrumental in removing the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which any ſincere and candid man may entertain from our proſecution of that claim. But, when called on to reaſon with a man, who will neither truſt the <hi>faith of nations,</hi> the <hi>ſanctity of laws and charters,</hi> nor any <hi>human ſecurity</hi> whatſoever, but will ſtill cry out—<hi>"danger, ſlavery, perſecution"</hi>— I find myſelf in the ſituation of <hi>one</hi> who fooliſhly undertook to reaſon a man into his ſenſes, whoſe imagination was continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly haunted with <hi>ghoſts</hi> and <hi>hobgoblins.</hi>—</p>
               <p>"Come, ſays he, who undertook this work, ſhew me the chamber where they are—For GOD's ſake, replies the other, enter not in. See how it ſtares! It is ready to devour you!—Where, where, ſays the former; I ſee no ſuch thing. In yonder corner! I beſeech you, continues the haunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man, go not near it!—Sir, ſays the former, it is no ſuch thing.

And thus might the dialogue pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed for ever, without conviction on the part of the poor diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered man.</p>
               <p>That I am doing no injuſtice to what is called the <hi>Centinel</hi>'s "arguments," I hope to ſhew to every candid reader. I ſhall, therefore, endeavour, with the utmoſt impartiality, to gather them into one view.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>There are grounds, he ſays, to ſuſpect that Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi> has not given the plan on which Biſhops are to be ſent to <hi>America,</hi> with that openneſs and candor that might have been expected.—It is <hi>plain, beyond a contradiction,</hi> that the defire of the Miſſionaries is to have ſuch ſuffragan Biſhops IMPORTED into <hi>America,</hi> as ſhall have authority to exerciſe all the powers given THEM
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <hi>If this confuſed ſentence has any meaning, it muſt be the following, and anſwers itſelf, viz. "The Miſſionaries want ſuch</hi> ſuffragan Biſhops <hi>in</hi> America <hi>as ſhall have authority to exerciſe the powers given</hi> them (<hi>the ſaid ſuffragan Biſhops, that are to be imported into</hi> America) <hi>by the laws of</hi> England." <hi>Now, truly, if the laws of</hi> England <hi>have given any powers to</hi> American <hi>ſuffragans, I cannot ſee that it would be illegal to exerciſe thoſe powers. But I do not know that ſuch ſuffragans are once mentioned in all the</hi> Engliſh <hi>laws.</hi>
                     </note> by the laws of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </q>— Now, altho' here he ſeems to make the Epiſcopal Clergy deſire
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:011212_0040_0F862D0E226EC9F0"/>a Biſhop in <hi>America,</hi> who has already "powers by the laws of <hi>England,</hi>" yet No. 11, and elſewhere, he intimates, that they want to introduce him by an act of Parliament," and new laws. In ſhort, he takes it for granted all along (for it would be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to quote particular papers, becauſe, if he denies this, we have no conteſt) that the deſign of the Epiſcopal Clergy is a general eſtabliſhment, as in <hi>England,</hi> through all <hi>America;</hi> that the ſending out a Biſhop is an eſtabliſhment of himſelf, as well as his Clergy; that whatever may be pretended, he muſt have juriſdiction over the laity; that <hi>arbitrary ſpiritual courts</hi> muſt inſeparably accompany him, &amp;c. <q>The laity, ſays he, are amuſed with the falſe and inconſiſtent hopes of being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely exempted from the juriſdiction of the <hi>American</hi> Biſhop. We call it an inconſiſtent hope, as it is contradictory, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the known ſentiments of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Epiſcopal Church, but alſo to the ſentiments of every other Chriſtian Church in the World. This plan of <hi>American</hi> Biſhops is a mere <hi>novel invention,</hi> without any parallel in hiſtory, ſince the firſt eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of a Church upon earth.</q>

               <p>Nevertheleſs, this conſiſtent writer, No. 15, "wonders at thoſe who have no idea of a Biſhop ſeparate from the appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages of the office;"—but ſtill, when he finds Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi> has this idea as well as himſelf, and ſpeaks of a Biſhop without the appendage of <hi>ſpiritual courts,</hi> he cries out—"What is this, but to ſay, that an <hi>arbitrary ſpiritual juriſdiction,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> conſtitution, and abhorre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi> has ſaid in the ſame ſentence, and the <hi>Centinel</hi> has quoted the words, that the Clergy are not to be governed arbitrarily, but "by laws and canons of the Church," clear and explicit in themſelves, which the Clergy have voluntarily bound themſelves to obey, and which may be executed in reſpect to them, without any juriſdiction over the laity, becauſe ſuch juriſdiction, as I ſhall fully ſhew, is derived
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:011212_0041_0F862D13EF31B9E0"/>from other laws, that neither have, nor are deſired to have, any place here.</p>
               <p>Theſe few "arguments" of the <hi>Centinel,</hi> will be ſufficient, till I try whether they can be anſwered. Others ſhall be quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their proper place; only it may not be amiſs to ſhew, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I begin, how, in thoſe already quoted, he is explained and helped out by his aſſociates, the <hi>Remonſtrant,</hi> &amp;c.—who tell us, "that there is a gathering ſtorm ready to burſt on them, and fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtroy them;" that they <hi>fear</hi> "Epiſcopacy, and its courts, will certainly be eſtabliſhed together; and that all judges and governors, who will not bow their necks to <hi>American</hi> Biſhops, will be tumbled down with diſgrace from their ſtations."— And then we hear of "LAUD, and <hi>Perſecutions,</hi> and flying once more to the wilderneſs, as their FATHERS did;" for it ſeems every writer now adays had <hi>fathers,</hi> and can count his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree back to the firſt ſettlement of <hi>America!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus cut out my work, the queſtion is, where to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; for I have not a <hi>ſingle ſpectre</hi> to lay, but am ſurrounded with them.—<q>"GORGONS, and HYDRAS, and CHIMERAS dire!"</q>
               </p>
               <p>I will begin then, at a venture; for it makes little odds where. The <hi>Centinel</hi>'s main argument ſeems to be—that "eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical courts, and ſlavery, and perſecutions," are a neceſſary conſequence of the introduction of <hi>Biſhops</hi> into <hi>America;</hi> and I am called on to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hew that his apprehenſions on this head are not well grounded. Hard it is to prove a <hi>negative,</hi> but in all fair argument, I ſhall do what may be equally ſatisfactory, if I prove this <hi>affirmative,</hi>—viz.—that it is <hi>poſſible,</hi> and even certain, that a Biſhop can be ſettled in <hi>America,</hi> without affecting the civil or religious rights of any perſon whatſoever; and that every preſumption that can be adduced to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, would milita<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e equally againſt every inſtitution in ſociety, even down to the appointment of a petty conſtable. And I will engage to ſhew much greater ſecurity againſt any arbitrary proceedings on the part of a Biſhop, than I think our antagoniſt will be able to ſhew on the part of ſuch ſelf-made, and ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated things, as <hi>Synods, Preſbyteries,</hi> and <hi>Kirk-Seſſions, in America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However ungenerouſly the <hi>Centinel</hi> has been pleaſed to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Epiſcopal Clergy of <hi>America,</hi> as in a conſpiracy with <hi>B—te</hi> and <hi>Gr—n—lle,</hi> to <hi>enſlave</hi> their country; however baſely he has aſſociated attempts for an <hi>American</hi> Biſhop with plans of rebellion, and the introduction of Popery, and the Pretender; however wickedly he has endeavoured to prejudice the vulgar, by jumbling our claim of natural right to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:011212_0041_0F862D13EF31B9E0"/>of a <hi>Chriſtian Church,</hi> with odious <hi>Stamp-Acts,</hi> and arbitrary <hi>Courts of Admiralty,</hi> yet I am bold to ſay, that if the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Clergy did not clearly ſee, and firmly believe, that what they aſk is perfectly conſiſtent with their own rights, and thoſe of the laity, they would deteſt the thoughts of becoming inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the ruin of their country. For what motive could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to ſuch a conduct? Surely the preſent ſett of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters can expect little perſonal benefit from any ſcheme of this kind. And they are not <hi>Anchorites,</hi> without children, nor wholly without property; nor is their prieſthood, like the <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,</hi> to deſcend from father to ſon.</p>
               <p>Surely then this abuſive writer ſhould have ſome ſolid foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations for ſuch a horrible charge againſt the Clergy, as that of ſhewing one ſcheme to the world "<hi>plauſible,</hi> ſpecious, and calculated to amuſe with inconſiſtent hopes," while the real one lies concealed under it, pregnant with every poſſible miſchief.— Let us ſee what thoſe foundations are.—</p>
               <p>He ſays, <q>the exemption of the laity from the juriſdiction of the Biſhop is contradictory, not only to the known ſentiments of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but of every other Chriſtian Church in the world—and is a mere novel invention, without any parallel in hiſtory, ſince the firſt eſtabliſhment of a Church on earth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now both theſe aſſertions I utterly deny; and if the <hi>Centinel</hi> was in earneſt in them, or meant any thing more than to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe on the ignorant, he muſt give me leave to pronounce him wholly unacquainted with <hi>Church-hiſtory,</hi> as well as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and the foundation of that temporal juriſdiction, with which it has been thought proper to veſt her Biſhops.</p>
               <p>What meaning the <hi>Centinel</hi> deſigns to have put on the words —"ſince the firſt eſtabliſhment of a Church on earth."— I know not. For he often writes, as if he choſe to keep a back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door for an eſcape, in caſe of detection. But if CHRIST can be ſaid to have eſtabliſhed a Church on earth, or if there was a Chriſtian Church during the three firſt centuries, then there were Biſhops during that period, ſuch as we deſire for <hi>America,</hi> that had no juriſdiction over the laity, different from what every Preſbyter had, as eſſential to the office of a paſtor.</p>
               <p>I ſhall give an authority for this, which will not be denied. It is the learned and accurate Civilian BURN.—For the firſt 300 years after CHRIST (he ſays) the diſtinction of eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and ſpiritual cauſes, in point of juriſdiction, did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin. At that time, no ſuch diſtinction was heard of, in the Chriſtian world. For the cauſes of teſtimony, matrimony,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:011212_0042_0F862D14B7CE8B78"/>baſtardy, adultery, and the reſt, which are called eccleſiaſtical or ſpiritual cauſes, were merely civil, and determined by the rules of the civil law, and ſubject only to the juriſdiction of the civil magiſtrate."</p>
               <p>What has BEEN, is <hi>poſſible</hi> to BE again; and the ſame author proceeds to ſhew how Biſhops came to have juriſdiction over the laity, even in cauſes called ſpiritual; which were never claimed as inherent in their ſpiritual character, or derived from CHRIST; but given by the powers then in <hi>being,</hi> for what they eſteemed ſalutary purpoſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Chriſtian Emperors, ſays he, out of a zeal to grace and honour learned and godly Biſhops, were pleaſed to <hi>ſingle out</hi> certain cauſes, wherein they granted them juriſdiction,— viz. in caſe of <hi>tithes,</hi> becauſe paid to the men of the Church; in cauſes of matrimony, becauſe marriages were, for the moſt part, ſolemnized in the Church; in cauſes teſtamentary, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe teſtaments were many times made <hi>in extremis,</hi> when Churchmen were preſent giving ſpiritual comfort;—and in all theſe cauſes, the Biſhops proceeded according to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial law, and as the civil magiſtrate did in other cauſes.</q> Who then will ſay that they aſſumed this juriſdiction, as inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from their office, or that it was arbitrary, or could have been exerciſed without law?</p>
               <p>In the ſame manner did the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops derive juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over the laity, in certain cauſes eccleſiaſtical. It is no doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of our Church, as the <hi>Centinel</hi> would aſſert, that they hold it inſeparable from their office, and immediately of CHRIST. This proud boaſt is indeed made by Independents and Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, tho' they have never yet produced their charter. But the latter, I mean the Preſbyterians, in the <hi>new</hi> national Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> hold this doctrine with much as bad a grace, as they accuſe our Church of Sham-elections, dictated by the King's <hi>Conge d'Elire.</hi> For though the General Aſſembly of the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> pretend that they meet yearly with CHRIST as their head, and from him alone derive their authority to determine cauſes, civil and eccleſiaſtical, yet the King, by his Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oner, ſits at leaſt as their viſible head, and when in his royal prerogative, he thinks fit to adjourn them to a certain day, they always find (and good worldly wiſdom it is) that CHRIST approves of what the King has done, and they adjourn them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the ſame day accordingly.</p>
               <p>Having already tranſgreſſed the bounds allotted me by my publiſhers, I ſhall, in my next, reſume this ſubject, and ſhow, by full authorities, that the propoſed plan for <hi>American</hi> Biſhops,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:011212_0042_0F862D14B7CE8B78"/>ſimply as it ſtands, is no <hi>novel invention,</hi> nor any way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to the known ſentiments of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>

Is it ſo rotten a fabrick, that it cannot bear to be touched? A Church that is ſo very tender, ſhould give no provocation. But does any of theſe quotations prove that the Independents would have cruſhed the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, or that they were the firſt aggreſſors in any of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates? No, it is well known that the Epiſcopal Miſſionaries, or their friends, firſt proclaimed the war, and when <hi>they</hi> were foundly drubbed, they would make the world believe, that the whole Church of England has been too roughly handled; but what have theſe ſquabbles to do with <hi>Chandler</hi>'s Appeal?

               <p>The firſt Epiſcopal Church ſet up among the Independents in New-England, was about the year 1680. They were poor, and few in number, and were allowed the uſe of the Town-houſe by the Independents, as he calls the Congregational Churches. Was not this an inſtance of brotherly love? It was an evidence of no malignity of ſpirit, or a deſire to cruſh them. But how did they requite this kindneſs <note n="*" place="bottom">

And when ſome gentlemen, proprietors of that houſe, refuſed to deliver them, Governor Androſs told them, <hi>he would preſently ſeize on that houſe, and all the Meeting-houſes in the country, and hinder them from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing the value of Two-pence towards the maintenance of any Non conformiſt Miniſter.</hi> And when this threatening could not prevail, they thruſt themſelves into the Meeting houſe, and there continued, until, by interrupting the people of the South Congregation, often in the <hi>times,</hi> and ſometimes in the very <hi>parts</hi> of their worſhip<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the whole town cried ſhame upon them. Here was a ſample of the ſame perſecuting ſpirit, from which the Independents fled to this wilderneſs. At the funeral of one Mr. Lilly, their Miniſter came with his <hi>gown</hi> and <hi>book,</hi> to read the ſervice, and to ſettle this laudable cuſtom in that barbarous country.

               <p>And, that the Miniſters might have their ſhare, Mr. Cotton Mather was proſecuted upon the <hi>act of Uniformity,</hi> and illegal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned, but the Revolution prevented the execution of the ſentence againſt him. For on that very day on which he was to be committed <hi>to half a year's impriſonment,</hi> thoſe that would have wronged him, were juſtly taken into cuſtody. This beloved <hi>act of Uniformity,</hi> and the penal laws in ſupport of it, tore the eſtabliſhed Church of England to pieces, and brought unnumbered miſchiefs on many of its own Miniſters and people, which it drove from their communion. And this ſame <hi>act of Uniformity,</hi> which the Epiſcopal Church determined to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh in New-England, began all thoſe controverſies, that the Anatomiſt complains of, and it had been for his honour, and for the benefit of his cauſe, rather to have let them ſleep in ſilence, than to have ſo ſpitefully revived them.</p>
               <p>It is urged, that ſince the Act of Toleration an exemplary ſpirit of moderation and Chriſtian charity have prevailed among the Epiſcopalians. For this we thank GOD, and for this we cheerfully praiſe, and give them due commendation, as far as they deſerve it. But are things really ſo?

Mr. Makemie, a worthy Preſbyterian Miniſter, preached a ſermon in New-York, at the deſire of a number of the inhabitants, who were Preſbyterians. And though he produced a certificate of his having qualified himſelf according to the Act of Toleration, he was committed to priſon, and proſecuted upon an indictment that ſays, <hi>that he unlawfully uſed other rites, ceremonies, form and manner of divine worſhip, than what are contained in a certain book of Common Prayer, and Adminiſtration of the Sacraments,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>againſt the form of the Statute.</hi> &amp;c.

No catechiſm was to be taught to children, but that of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and no man under ſevere penalties, was allowed to teach even an Engliſh ſchool, who did not, in all things, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to that Church. Let our Anatomiſt call this unmerited abuſe; it is the truth, and it was done when High Church rode triumphant.

               <p>In Connecticut the Epiſcopal party carried their pretenſions to an eſtabliſhment in the Plantations, by the Act of Unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, to a very high pitch.

               <p>As the old ſtory of New-England perſecution is again repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to the diſadvantage of Preſbyterians, though the Anatomiſt allows it was done by the Independents, we will once more give it a due attention. We declare, in the moſt ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that we deteſt and abhor perſecution for conſcience ſake, in Preſbyterians, Independents, Epiſcopalians and Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, as inhuman and antichriſtian. We obſerved already, that the people of New-England were led into theſe ſeverities by an act of parliament, made in the 35th year of Elizabeth, which condemns all Non-conformiſts, after they are convicted, to <hi>baniſhment;</hi> in caſe of return, without licence, to <hi>death,</hi> without benefit of Clergy.

The perſecution in New-England was in a time of troubles both in Church and State; the perſecution in Old-England was in a time of peace and tranquility, when the Church of England ſat at the helm, and carried all before her. The Quakers could not, with any colour or pretence, be proſecuted by the government for any plots or conſpiracies, or any diſturſbance given to the peace of the State, yet a law was enacted againſt <hi>them in particular,</hi> anno 1662, intituled, An Act for preventing miſchiefs, and danger that might ariſe from certain people called Quakers, by which they were made liable to ſevere fines and impriſonment, and after the third of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to tranſportation, <hi>for refuſing to ſwear.</hi> I ſhall here tranſcribe a paſſage from Sewell's Hiſtory (Page 335) <q>Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now left America, and returned to England, let us go and ſee the ſtate of perſecution at London, where deſperate ſury now raged, though it was not in that chief city alone the Quakers, ſo called, were moſt grievouſly perſecuted; for a little before this time there was publiſhed in print, a
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:011212_0044_0F862D15B0641790"/>ſhort relation of their perſecution through all England, ſigned by twelve perſons, ſhewing that more than <hi>four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand two hundred</hi> of thoſe called Quakers, both men and women, were in priſon in England, and denoting the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of them that were impriſoned in each county, either for <hi>frequenting Meetings,</hi> or for <hi>denying to ſwear.</hi> &amp;c. Many of theſe had been grievouſly beaten, or their clothes torn, or taken away from them, and ſome were put into ſuch ſtinking dungeons, that ſome great men ſaid, they would not put their hunting dogs there. Some priſons were crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed full, both of men and women, ſo that there was not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient room for all to ſit down at once; and in Cheſſm, <hi>ſixty eight</hi> perſons, were in this manner looked up in a ſmall room; an evident ſign, that they were an harmleſs people, that would not make any reſiſtance, nor uſe force. By ſuch ill treatment many grew ſick, and <hi>not a few died</hi> in ſuch jails; for no age, nor ſex, was regarded. Even ancient people of ſixty, ſeventy, and more years of age, were not ſpared; and moſt of theſe, being tradeſmen, ſhop-keepers, and huſbandmen, were thus reduced to poverty. For their goods were alſo ſeized for not going to Church (ſo called) or for not <hi>paying tithes.</hi> Many times they were fain to lie in priſon, on cold naſty ground, without being ſuffered to have any ſtraw, and often they have been kept ſeveral days <hi>without any victu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als.</hi> No wonder therefore many died by ſuch hard impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as theſe,</q>

                  <q>At London, and in the ſuburbs, were about this time no leſs than <hi>five hundred</hi> of thoſe people called Quakers, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned; and ſome in ſuch narrow holes, that every perſon had ſcarcely conveniency to lie down, and the felons were ſuffered to rob them of their clothes and money.</q>— This author proceeds to relate many inſtances of cruelty and ſeverity to theſe people, during the adminiſtration of the two brothers, Charles and James. He informs us (Page 517) that ſince the Reſtoration of King Charles (till the year 1676) above <hi>two hundred</hi> of the people called Quakers, had <hi>died in priſons</hi> in England, where they had been confined becauſe of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. But they were not the only ſufferers. It is well known that De Laune, who wrote the Plea for Non-conformity, was one of near <hi>eight thouſand,</hi> who had periſhed in priſon in the reign of King Charles the Second, merely for diſſenting from the Church in ſome points, for which they were able to give reaſons; and that one Jeremiah White had carefully collected a liſt of the Diſſenting ſufferers, and of their ſufferings, and had the names of ſixty thouſand perſons, who had ſuffered on
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:011212_0045_0F862D16650A0A58"/>a religious account, between the Reſtoration of King Charles the Second, and the Revolution by King William; <hi>five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi> of whom <hi>died in priſon</hi> (Neal, Vol. 4. Page 450) The Anatomiſt threatens us with <hi>unſolding a tale</hi> to our diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, if we ſpeak of theſe ſeverities. We aſſure him we never intended to have mentioned theſe ſevere acts that bore down Diſſenters for near one hundred years, had he not proclaimed Preſbyterians ſour and intolerant, and tried to <hi>blacken them</hi> as a body, who are ſo reſpectable a part of the Proteſtant Churches. It is well known, that they were the firſt people in Europe that gave univerſal toleration to all religious denominations; but we fear no tales; if they be but true, let them be fairly told, to the diſhonor of all perſecutors. We have neither the incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation nor the power to obtain an eſtabliſhment to harraſs and diſturb other religious ſocieties in America. But that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Miſſionaries, and others of their party, were they <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, and protected by Biſhops,</hi> have both the power and the inclination, is what we greatly fear. We are prepared to hang out the perſecutions of a Parker, a Whitegift, a Laud, and a Bancroft, to the world, to excite the hatred of mankind a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt religious tyranny; and to raiſe their horror and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of theſe ſevere acts that clothed ſuch oppreſſors with power to do miſchief. But if the Anatomiſt, inſtead of abuſing his neighbours, proceeds with ſober arguments to anſwer the objections raiſed by the Centinel againſt Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s Appeal, we ſhall leave him and his adverſary to diſpute the point; only we deſire that he may do it with the calmneſs which does ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour both to the Centinel and the Doctor. We ſhall lie on our oars, and if relieved of our fears, ſhall ſay no more of penal laws and perſecutions. But if inſtead of arguments, and ſound reaſons, we have nothing but ſhifts and evaſions, we muſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by analogy; and by what has happened from an Engliſh Epiſcopate, ſhall argue what we muſt fear from an epiſcopate, if it be eſtabliſhed in America.</p>

Nay, though educated among them, this Prince was obliged to complain to his Parliament, "that they were a ſet of men, ever diſcontented, and ſcarcely to be ſuffered in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny well-governed commonwealth, becauſe nothing can fully ſatisfy them, but the alteration of the whole frame of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment."</p>
               <p>How much of this character belongs to the <hi>Centinel</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writers, who have been taken notice of in my former num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, I leave every reader to determine for himſelf.

We have ſome regard to our allegiance; and think this thing does not comport with it. We hope alſo, we have ſome regard to our principles of Church government, and would not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly violate them. Laſtly, we regard decorum and peace; and we think neither would be promoted by unauthorized elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or a government of this kind; but above all, we are known to hold it as a principle, that the Epiſcopal character cannot be derived in this manner. Thoſe who think otherwiſe, and chooſe to be governed otherwiſe, we do not deſire to moleſt; and only claim equal liberty to think for ourſelves, and follow that mode which we eſteem beſt, and moſt agreeable to holy ſcripture and primitive practice.</p>
               <p>But the Centinel in his charity, ſtrives to remove our ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples on this head, by attempting to ſhew, (what has often been attempted before him) that <hi>Biſhops and Preſbyters are the ſame in ſcripture.</hi> No doubt, he was in hopes, from this doctrine, to lead the advocates for an American Epiſcopacy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>to a long train of diſpute very foreign to the point in queſtion; which is not, whether it is a right belief in the Church—"that Biſhops are of a divine inſtitution, an order ſuperior to Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and eſſential to a full eccleſiaſtical conſtitution;" but whether this being the belief of her Clergy and Members in America, they are not entitled to ſuch a conſtitution, provided it does not interfere with the rights of others? Here I fix my arguments, and from this ground I will not be drawn. It is vain, (and indeed would ſcarce be proper in a news-paper) for ſuch <hi>puny combitants</hi> as we <hi>Centinels, Anatomiſts,</hi> and <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants,</hi> to retail over again all that has been written on this ſubject by eminent men on both ſides. The Church can boaſt many champions, but particularly her venerable <hi>Hooker,</hi> whoſe arguments in the ſeventh book of his eccleſiaſticle polity, ſtand to this day unrefuted.</p>
               <p>This excellent and learned writer (excellent and learned e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the opinion of our antagoniſts) goes to the fountain head of ſcripture and Church antiquity. He ſhews what things belonged eſſentially to the office of Biſhops from the beginning,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:011212_0046_0F862D172FDA1B58"/>and what were added to it afterwards for reaſons of convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and human policy. He proves that there ever were in the Church of Chriſt an order of men, to whom were given, with permanent continuance, not only power in common with Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters to adminiſter the word and ſacraments, but alſo a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther power to ordain eccleſiaſtical perſons, and a <hi>chiefty</hi> (or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy) in government over the Church. Authentic liſts of ſuch Biſhops from the earlieſt times can be produced, which, whoever will queſtion, may as well queſtion all facts of hiſtory, and whether there was a conſtant ſucceſſion of Roman Emperors from Julius Caeſar.</p>
               <p>"A thouſand five hundred years and upwards (ſays he) the Church hath continued under Biſhops; which to have been or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God, I am, for my own part, even as reſolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, as that any other kind of government in the world is of God. In this realm of England, before <hi>Normans;</hi> yea, before <hi>Saxons,</hi> there being Chriſtians the chief paſtors of their ſouls were Biſhops.—Even at the council of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> about the year 359, Britain had <hi>three</hi> Biſhops preſent'"</p>
               <p>Thus then if we were not able to go back to the time of the apoſtles, to prove that a government by <hi>one</hi> had a preference to a Preſbyterian government by <hi>many,</hi> yet we can go far enough back, even in the Mother Country, to ſpare our antagoniſts a <hi>thouſand years,</hi> and ſtill have antiquity on our ſide, If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, this veneration for antiquity were only a prejudice on ourſide, yet as it is a harmleſs one, we may be indulged in it.</p>
               <p>But it is objected, that granting the ancient power of Biſhops in ordination, yet it is not practiſed now as in the Apoſtles' times, in purſuance of ſome previous vote or election of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, &amp;c. Our venerable Hooker, who could ſometimes be merry, laughs at this objection, and ſhews that all the power given to the people by our antagoniſts themſelves in the choice or direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perſons fit to be ſet apart for the ſacred miniſtry, is a mere illuſion; and that they deal by the people in this caſe "<hi>much as thoſe nurſes do with infants, whoſe mouth they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmear with the</hi> BACKSIDE <hi>of the ſpoon, as though they had fed them, when they themſelves devour the food.</hi>"</p>
               <p>But what vote of the people, beſides the impoſition of St. Paul's hands had Timothy; whom no one, without denying ſcripture, can deny to have been a Biſhop, or a paſtor having power ſuperior to that of Preſbyters? "For he was to rule the Church of Epheſus; to <hi>command</hi> and <hi>teach;</hi> to regulate the public worſhip, and hinder women from ſpeaking: to ſee that <hi>no doctrines were taught but what were received from our Lord

               <p>Here are pointed out the peculiar authorities exerciſed by the primitive Biſhops; and in the like matter, and with the like authorities, not by the people's choice was Titus ordained Biſhop of <hi>Crete</hi> by Paul; and we do believe, from the whole voice of Church hiſtory, that there was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ſtantly afterwards a ſucceſſion of men, with the power of ordination and government ſuperior to Preſbyters in the Church.</p>
               <p>Indeed Calvin himſelf, the founder of Preſbytery, doth allow that in the firſt ages of Chriſtianity there were Biſhops that had the like power in the aſſembly of miniſters, as the Roman Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuls in the ſenate, to adviſe, exhort, regulate debates, and ſee that every thing was performed according to rules agreed on. This power is all that we have occaſion to contend for in the matter of government; and the <hi>Centinel</hi> himſelf allows, "that few profeſſors of Chriſtianity deny Biſhops to be of divine inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution;" nay further, his aſſociate the <hi>Remonſtrant</hi> is willing to allow us twenty Biſhops (even one in every houſe) to ordain, confirm, and inſpect the morals of the clergy, provided they have no connection with our civil affairs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Theſe conceſſions are ſomething, but alas! I muſt not flatter myſelf that they will be allowed to do me much good. The <hi>Centinel</hi> contends that it is impoſſible for us to have ſuch primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Biſhops; becauſe contradictory to the known ſentiments of our Church, and of every other ſince the firſt eſtabliſhment of Chriſtianity.

<pb n="85" facs="unknown:011212_0047_0F862D1AAF88DA90"/>a juriſdiction over the laity as the Centinel complains of; for it would be abſurd to ſay, he ſpeaks here of ſuch a power, as his own paſtors or <hi>Preſbyterian Biſhops</hi> (for ſo they like to be called) think it neceſſary to exerciſe over the flock committed to them, whether in one or more congregations. If that were his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it would be nothing at all to his argument, For ſurely, he could not in decency ſtrive to alarm all America againſt ſuch a neceſſary power as this, unleſs he could ſay that the ſame pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which is perfectly innocent in the hands of a Preſbyterian Biſhop, would be highly dangerous in a Biſhop of ours; and that what is right in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> ceaſes to be ſo in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>America,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Much has been ſaid about <hi>dioceſan Epiſcopacy,</hi> and ſometimes to little purpoſe. The truth is, that though ſuch a Biſhop as <hi>Timothy</hi> was appointed to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> as his more particular charge, yet he and other Biſhops of his time, were not proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Dioceſan,</hi> but Biſhops at large, who might ordain and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern in the Church <hi>in general,</hi> for the more ſpeedy propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſtianity. But it is reaſonable to think, (and ancient accounts prove it) that, as this method could not be neceſſary long, ſo it did not long continue; but, for greater conveniency and regularity, different Biſhops became fixed to different diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts; and thus a ſort of <hi>Dioceſan Epiſcopacy</hi> ſoon began; yet ſtill, without thoſe additions of temporal power, and legal li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of dioceſes, which conſtitute the preſent Dioceſan E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopacy; and which could not poſſibly take place till civil ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers became Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Now, if the Centinel means any thing by a "juriſdiction over the laity, dangerous to liberty," he muſt mean the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction exerciſed under this laſt ſort of Dioceſan Epiſcopacy; for his own principles will not permit him to object to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers exerciſed under the former ſort of Epiſcopacy. Why then, when he has quoted ſuch eminent writers in our Church, as having a juſt idea of this ſort of Epiſcopacy, will he ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on it that ſuch an Epiſcopacy is a <hi>novel invention,</hi> inconſiſtent with the ſentiments of any Church that ever was on earth? Why cannot he diſtinguiſh between the true <hi>Epiſcopal charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> and an adventitious character and powers afterwards an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to it? And theſe adventitious powers have been greater or ſmaller in different countries, and in the ſame country at different times, he cannot ſurely think the real epiſcopal cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter eſſentially connected with them, or altered either by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or taking them away. I would aſk "whether if the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of this province ſhould annex the office of ſurveyor ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral to that of firſt miniſter of the firſt Preſbyterian Church in
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:011212_0048_0F862D1D57C2BBB0"/>this city, it would diveſt him of his miniſterial character? Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome good people might think the one office rather incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the other, but it would not deſtroy the idea of the miniſterial character; nor would it follow, that if this firſt mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſhould go to another province, the like adventitious office would be eſſential to this miniſterial character.</p>
               <p>Upon what better principle can our Centinel argue that our Church would conſider and claim all the powers and juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on annexed to the Epiſcopal office in England, as eſſential to it in America? I ſhall ſhew by full authorities, that this neither is, nor can be, the principles of any Churchmen whatever, nor of any man acquainted with the laws of his country, either ſtatute, common or civil. I thought to have proceeded with theſe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities at preſent, but as they cannot be inſerted entire, with the proper remarks, they muſt be deferred till my next number, in which, if I do not miſtake my points of law, I hope this diſpute will be brought into a narrow compaſs.</p>

I ſaw with concern from the firſt, that by whoſe malice and artifice ſoever the late illiberal attacks on the Church were begun and cheriſhed, they would certainly be productive of much evil, ſcandalize our common <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and be matter of joy to its enemies, and grief to its real friends. This ſeems now to be the general ſentiment of ſerious men of all perſuaſions: and it is but juſtice to ſay that I have me, with many, even among the <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> who lament that any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation was given on their ſide; and think that their writers would have ſhewn a greater moment and weight of <hi>Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> in one grain of <hi>Charity</hi> and brotherly <hi>Good-will</hi> to the CHURCH, than in all that they have written and publiſhed, to traduce and prevent her from enjoying her juſt rights.</p>

               <p>In my laſt, it was obſerved that the <hi>Centinel</hi> (either out of ignorance or wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He hath in his imagination, ſtretched the powers of our preſent Engliſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to all the heights in which they were ever exerciſed in the warmeſt times, and when liberty was leaſt underſtood; and then when it is ſaid that Biſhop, with thoſe powers are neither deſired, nor can, conſiſtent with law, be fixed in America, he charges the clergy with acting a treacherous part, and "amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with falſe and inconſiſtent hopes; becauſe a <hi>Church,</hi> whoſe members are exempted from the government of its officers, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>Now the <hi>Centinel</hi> is here certainly brought into this <hi>Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> either to ſay that a Church without all thoſe enormous ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdictions, which he had been complaining of, is a novel-Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or to ſay that the powers he ſpeaks of, are thoſe eſſential ones enjoyed by all <hi>complete</hi> Churches; and then how is it an argument of inconſiſtency in our clergy, to deſire a matter of common eſſential right?

                  </gap> all his declamations been employed about phantoms of his own brain?</p>
               <p>I have already ſhewn that ſuch a Biſhop as the American Clergy pray'd for, is no novel-invention, but known in the pureſt ages of the Church; and I might have ſhewn further, in contradiction to what the Centinel aſſerts, that Churches, even now upon earth, have Biſhops nearly on the ſame foundation. The <hi>Daniſh Biſhops</hi> have neither temporal Juriſdiction, nor ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical courts; nor have the <hi>Moravian Biſhops,</hi> and yet they have the ordination and government of their inferior cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rgy.</p>
               <p>But I will now come cloſe to the point, and ſhew that the <hi>Engliſh Biſhops</hi> were originally ſuch alſo, and that what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of power and temporal juriſdiction they obtained, was
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:011212_0049_0F862D1E27DEDD08"/>not by encroachments nor yet claimed as of CHRIST, in virtue of their epiſcopal office; but given by human laws, generally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the reaſon of the Grant, and that neither thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> nor <hi>Reaſons</hi> can have place in a country where the conſtitution is previouſly fixed, and a full proviſion made for all the parts of government, except that alone which governs the true ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural order and government of the <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> clergy, agreeable to the belief and conſtitution of their church.</p>
               <p>The firſt thing that offends our antagoniſts, with reſpect to Biſhops is their title of <hi>Lords.</hi> Now if it is conſidered how they derive this title, perhaps the <hi>Centinel</hi> may not think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obliged to aſſociate the idea of <hi>Lords</hi> to our American <hi>Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops,</hi> nor to ſhape his mouth, to that offenſive word, if he ſhould ever chance to ſpeak to any of them. They are <hi>Lords</hi> as they ſit in the upper houſe of Parliament, and they ſit there <hi>per Baroniam,</hi> as Barons accepted by long uſages, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards more expreſsly made ſuch by their poſſeſſions being turned into Baronies by William the Conqueror, to be held of the King. In reſpect to their perſons they are not Barons, nor are they ſuch in reſpect to their order, which they acquire by conſecration, but in reſpect only to their temporal incorporation. See Hale's Treatiſe on the Right of the Crown, and Coke 2d. Inſt. Sir William Staun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ord alſo (153) ſays they have not the name of Lords by virtue of their office, nor have they a place in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament in reſpect to their nobility, but in reſpect of their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, viz. the ancient Baronies annexed to their dignities.</p>
               <p>Thus the Centinel may perhaps ſee a way to ſeparate one of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive thing, viz. the <hi>Lordly</hi> name, from American Biſhops, but ſtill we hope he will not, for all this, call them bad names.</p>
               <p>But let us paſs from names to things, and ſee if we can ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy him equally about the enormous juriſdiction over the <hi>Laity</hi> which he has told us, he is greatly apprehenſive muſt accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the very perſons of Biſhops into America. In fair argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (as obſerved in a former number) the <hi>Onus Probandi</hi> ſhould lie on the accuſer, and he ought to ſhew by what law now made, or that probably can be made, American Biſhops ſhould obtain ſuch juriſdiction; rather than call on me to prove what contingences are never to take place. Yet even this may be done to the ſatisfaction of all reaſonable men, if they will truſt to the ſame faith of laws and ſecurity in this matter, which they truſt for their lives and eſtates in all other matters.</p>
               <p>We muſt go back, then, to enquire how Engliſh Biſhops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came inveſted with juriſdiction over the <hi>Laity</hi> (for the Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:011212_0049_0F862D1E27DEDD08"/>has nothing to do with any juriſdiction the clergy may chooſe to ſubmit to) and then we will apply the argument to the point in queſtion.</p>
               <p>It has been already ſhewn that primitive Biſhops in the firſt three hundred years of the Church, had no courts or juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on over the laity, ſeparate from the civil power. So it was alſo in England, during the <hi>Saxon Heptarchy.</hi> In each county under different Kings in thoſe days, there was an EARL who had the adminiſtration of Juſtice under the KING and was called in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin <hi>Comes,</hi> as aſſiſting the King in the execution of the laws. In each kingdom there was a BISHOP, being ſeven in all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland (excluſive of the <hi>Welch</hi> or <hi>Britiſh</hi> Biſhops) before the coming of <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the <hi>Monk.</hi> All matters as well ſpiritual as temporal, were determined in the EARL's or county Court, where the <hi>Biſhop</hi> was called to the <hi>Earl</hi>'s aſſiſtance for advice in ſpiritual matters; or in the Hundred Court, before ſome Lord of the Diſtrict, with an eccleſiaſtical perſon in the place of the Biſhop.<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>TWO things cannot but be obvious to every one who pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſes the late publications on the ſubject of <hi>American</hi> Biſhops, viz.—</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt, That the advocates for an <hi>American</hi> Epiſcopacy do ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly declare they have no farther, nor other view in this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, than that the Epiſcopal Churches in the colonies, may have the ſame opportunities of keeping up a ſucceſſion of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Eccleſiaſtical order, in their body, and agreeable to
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:011212_0050_0F862D1EAA36F608"/>their principles, which all other religious bodies in <hi>America</hi> do enjoy.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, That the opponents of this meaſure ſtrive to alarm all <hi>America</hi> againſt it, contending, that although the above may be the ſpecious plea of the Epiſcopal Clergy, yet their true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign (notwithſtanding any aſſertions to the contrary) is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce that yoke of ſpiritual bondage and juriſdiction over the laity, which neither they nor their fathers could bear.</p>
               <p>This is clearly the deſign of the <hi>Centinel</hi>'s productions; whoſe arguments for ſuch a bold aſſertion, I am now examining; and if they ſhould be found groundleſs, the public will be at no loſs to pronounce him either one of the moſt uncharitable wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on earth, or one of the moſt <hi>ambitious,</hi> in ſtriving to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alt his own party, by depriving another (reſpectable among all <hi>Proteſtants</hi>) of its juſt and eſſential rights.</p>
               <p>It hath been already ſhewn, that during the three firſt centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Biſhops had not, in any part of the world, juriſdiction over the laity, ſeparate from the civil powers; nor different from what every Preſbyter<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>It is not eſſential to this argument to inquire, whether, in thoſe early days, excommunications, and Church cenſures, were reſerved as the peculiar right of the Biſhop alone, or might be put in force by Preſbyters, without the Biſhop. It is no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whether theſe Church powers were in</hi> one <hi>or</hi> many, <hi>if they were ſtill in the Church. The powers here ſpoken of are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, viz. ſuch as Engliſh Biſhops enjoy, by virtue of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar laws and conſtitutions, beyond what might be exerciſed over the laity by a Preſbyterian Claſſis or Synod, or by a Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church, or any other body Eccleſiaſtical, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>aiming govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment within itſelf, in matters eſſential to its very being. And powers greater than thoſe, I ſay, can never be exerciſed in</hi> America, <hi>nor any where elſe, without law.</hi>
                  </note> might have, as eſſential to the paſtoral office. I have ſhewn that in <hi>England</hi> alſo, the Biſhops had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ſort of concurrent juriſdiction in the civil courts; and no ſeparate Eccleſiaſtical Courts for the ten firſt centuries, and the <hi>William the Conqueror</hi> firſt ſeparated the Eccleſiaſtical from the Civil Courts, out of a deſire, as he ſays, to do honour to GOD, and godly Biſhops. Laſtly, it hath been obſerved that the Daniſh Biſhops, at this day, have no Eccleſiaſtical Courts, or grievous juriſdiction, over the laity.</p>
               <p>What then becomes of the <hi>Centinel</hi>'s aſſertion, that Biſhops, without Eccleſiaſtical Courts, and that grievous juriſdiction over
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:011212_0051_0F862D5B40E2CA98"/>the laity, which he charges the Epiſcopal Clergy with deſiring to introduce into <hi>America,</hi> is a "novel-invention, contrary to the known ſentiments of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church on earth; and that therefore the Clergy are not to be believed in this matter, but are amuſing with falſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent hopes?"</p>
               <p>But another argument (as ſtated partly by the <hi>Centinel,</hi> and partly by others) is—"That <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops now have this obnoxious juriſdiction over the laity by long enjoyment; that their powers are known by the law of <hi>England,</hi> ſtatute and common (for it is needleſs here to ſpeak of civil or canon <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Neither the civil nor canon law (ſaith lord</hi> Hale) <hi>have any obligation in this realm—but ſo far as they have been admitted either by conſent of Parliament, and ſo are part of the ſtatute laws; or by immemorial uſage in certain courts and cauſes, and ſo are part of the common law. If it be ſhewn, then, that neither the ſtatute nor common law extends to</hi> Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica <hi>in Eccleſiaſtical cauſes, then neither canon or civil law can extend, which derives its validity from the former.</hi>—</note> law) and that therefore, as we are an <hi>Engliſh</hi> colony, thoſe laws which concerned the office of Biſhops before we had legiſlatures of our own (by a well known conſtruction of ſuch ancient laws) will be conſidered as extended, together with the perſon and office of a Biſhop, into <hi>America.</hi>"</p>
               <p>Having ſtated this argument, I think, in its full force, I proceed to anſwer it, and muſt take up Biſhops where I left them in my laſt, viz. from the time of <hi>William the Conqueror.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was from the charter of this Prince (already quoted) that <hi>Engliſh</hi> Biſhops derived the right of juriſdiction in ſeparate Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Courts; and no one will pretend, that either that charter, or any uſage antecedent to it, would be a foundation for ſuch courts in <hi>America.</hi> After the grant of this charter, the Biſhops, in their ſeparate courts, proceeded by the ſame an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient laws and cuſtoms, which had been obſerved for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, in matters of the like kind, during their concurrent juriſdiction with the <hi>Earl</hi> or <hi>Sheriff</hi> in the County Aſſembly. We find no new ſtatute to enlarge their powers, but many, ſuch as the <hi>ſtatutes of proviſors,</hi> &amp;c. to reſtrict and explain them; to birdle the uſurpations of the Popes, to prev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> appeals to foreign juriſdictions, and to vindicate the ſupremacy of our own Kings in all cauſes, Civil and Eccleſiaſtical.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="93" facs="unknown:011212_0051_0F862D5B40E2CA98"/>It would be needleſs to dwell long on this gloomy period, or the various ſtruggles it produced. It is ſufficient to ſay that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven then, the whole ſpirit of the laws was this—That Biſhops could exerciſe no powers by virtue of the <hi>canons, reſcripts</hi> or <hi>decrees</hi> of Popes, Emperors or foreign councils; unleſs ſo far as thoſe powers were allowed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y the common law of the land; and if thoſe bounds were exceeded it would not have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a ſufficient anſwer—to tell the King's Courts, that <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> or Pope <hi>Gregory,</hi> had decreed otherwiſe; for all courts are controuled by the common law."</p>
               <p>But leaving this uninſtructive period, let us come to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops under the Reformation. Now their courts are ſtill held ſeparate from the civil, in virtue of the ancient appointment made by the Conqueror, allowed and confirmed as part of the law of <hi>England</hi> by long uſage. But neither the Reformation, nor the received conſtruction of the common law, nor any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive ſtatute, have extended the juriſdiction of thoſe courts; but all have conſpired to define, limit, and explain it. Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> and Lord <hi>Hale,</hi> have accurately explained both the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of Eccleſiaſtical Courts, and the ſundry matters cogniza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in them by the law of the land.</p>
               <p>"As in temporal cauſes the King, by the mouth of his judges, doth judge and determine the ſame by the temporal laws of <hi>England;</hi> ſo in cauſes Eccleſiaſtical and Spiritual, the cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance whereof belongeth not to the common laws, the ſame are to be determined by Eccleſiaſtical judges, according to the King's Eccleſiaſtical laws; which, whoſoever ſhall deny, he denieth that the King hath plenary power to deliver juſtice in all cauſes to all his ſubjects in theſe kingdoms."—Yet ſtill all Eccleſiaſtical laws are declared to be <hi>ſub graviori lege.</hi> The <hi>ſigna</hi> ſuperioritatis are always carried by the <hi>common law;</hi> and if Eccleſiaſtical judges refuſe to allow acts of Parliament, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound them in any other ſenſe than is truly and properly the expoſition of them; or if the cauſe be mixt, and ſome part of it properly triable at common law, they muſt proceed according to the rules of that law, or the King's Courts in all theſe caſes can grant prohibitions, and take the matter before themſelves; ſo that the Eccleſiaſtical Courts in <hi>England</hi> are not now thoſe wild and rampant things that they have been deſcribed to be.</p>
               <p>But whatever they are, I am to ſhew, that neither the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon nor ſtatute law of <hi>England</hi> can introduce them here in any form,</p>
               <p>It is a known rule, that in a colony, having legiſlation of its own, the laws of the mother country do not extend to any mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:011212_0052_0F862D5BEFE72B18"/>that hath been provided for by the laws of the colony itſelf, duly made and confirmed. Now the matters whereof the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Courts in <hi>England</hi> have juriſdiction, are principally the following, viz. <hi>blaſphemy, celebration of divine ſervice, rights of matrimony, divorces, general baſtardy, probate of teſtaments, adminiſtrations and accounts upon the ſame, inceſts, fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and adulteries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now the laws of this and every other colony have already made proviſion for the adminiſtration of juſtice, in reſpect to all thoſe matters; and our courts of law would never ſuffer any Biſhop to exerciſe juriſdiction in them. For example, ſhould our Biſhop claim the probate of wills in this province, no one need be at a loſs to gueſs how little diſturbance ſuch a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs claim would give to the eminent lawyer, who holds that office by as firm a right as any other can be held by the laws of this country. Should a Biſhop call a trial of <hi>baſtardy</hi> out of the courts of law before himſelf, our judges would ſmile at his preſumption, or perhaps puniſh him for it, if he perſevered to diſturb the due adminiſtration of juſtice. And ſo of the reſt. As to matters of <hi>tithes, dilapidations, reparation of Churches, ſimony, ordering admiſſions, and inſtitution of clerks,</hi> there can no ſuch things be ſo much as known, unleſs where there is a full eſtabliſhment of Clergy, and Dioceſan Epiſcopacy, and ſuch an eſtabliſhment was never known to be brought about in any country by implication, or without poſitive and expreſs laws for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> in the liſt given of the matters whereof <hi>Biſhops</hi> have cognizance in <hi>England,</hi> hath mentioned only two or three more than I have taken notice of, and we are ſecured againſt any diſturbance on account of them, by the happy <hi>toleration act,</hi> and that liberty of conſcience ſecured in every <hi>American</hi> colony.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, this I aver—That a dioceſe, with temporalties, cannot be created but by law, and that a Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op, in any temporal capacity, without a dioceſe and legal eſtabliſhment, is what the laws of England know nothing of; and on this principle, all that has been ſaid about erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Eccleſiaſtical Courts in <hi>America,</hi> falls to the ground at once.</p>
               <p>I have never met with a <hi>lawyer</hi> in the colonies that denied theſe poſitions. I have indeed been told, that two or three ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſiderable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>wyers, to the northward, have ſaid, that a <hi>Biſhop</hi> in <hi>America</hi> would, by the <hi>common law of England,</hi> be conſidered as a <hi>Dioceſan Biſhop,</hi> bringing the laws of Dioceſan Epiſcopacy with him; and that the Church would thereby
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:011212_0052_0F862D5BEFE72B18"/>gain an eſtabliſhment. If theſe gentlemen can aſſert this thing, they not only diſgrace their acknowledged abilities, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict themſelves, to ſerve a preſent turn; for they aſſerted the direct contrary when it ſerved another turn, about 15 years ago.</p>
               <p>I have a paper before me (viz. the <hi>Independent Reflector,</hi> No. 44, dated September 27, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>53, known to be clubbed by them) in which they write thus, and more like men of the law, than in ſome of their late writings, viz.—</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Whether the Church of <hi>England</hi> is equally eſtabliſhed in the colonies, as in the ſouthern parts of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> is a queſtion that has often been controverted. Thoſe who hold the <hi>affirmative,</hi> adduce two arguments,</q> viz—</p>
               <p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt, that as we are an</hi> Engliſh <hi>colony, the conſtitutional laws of our mother country, antecedent to a legiſlature of our own, are binding on us; and therefore, at the planting of this colony, the</hi> Engliſh <hi>religious eſtabliſhment took place.</hi>
                  </q> —They then proceed to anſwer this argument as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.—</p>
               <p>
                  <q>It muſt be confeſſed,—that every new colony, till it has a legiſlature of its own, is, in general, ſubject to the laws of the country from which it originally ſprung; but that all of them, without diſtinction, are to be ſuppoſed binding upon ſuch planters, is neither agreeable to <hi>law</hi> nor <hi>reaſon.</hi> The laws which they carry with them, and to which they are ſubject, are ſuch as are abſolutely neceſſary to anſwer the original intention of our entering into a ſtate of ſociety.— But no ſuch neceſſity can be pretended in favour of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of any religious eſtabliſhment whatſoever,— becauſe civil ſociety, as it is antecedent to any Eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſhments, is, in its own nature, unconnected with them, independent of them, and all ſociable happineſs completely attainable without them.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <q>2dly, To ſuppoſe all the laws of <hi>England,</hi> without diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, obligatory upon every new colony at its implantation, is abſurd.—It would introduce a thouſand laws incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the ſtate of a new country—To uſe the words of the preſent Attorney-General, Sir DUDLFY RIDER, <hi>it would be acting the part of an unſkilful phyſician, who ſhould preſcribe the ſame doſe to every patient, without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing the variety of diſtempers and conſtitutions.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this doctrine, we are ſubject to the payment of
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:011212_0053_0F862D5C2883DF38"/>TYTHES, and ought to have a<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <q>3dly, If the planters of every colony carry with them the eſtabliſhed religion of the country from whence they emigrate, it follows, that if a colony had been planted when the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi> nation were <hi>Pagans,</hi> the eſtabliſhment in ſuch a colony muſt be <hi>Paganiſm</hi> alone.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4thly, That the Church of <hi>England</hi> is not eſtabliſhed by the <hi>common law,</hi> "appears from the following conſiderations."</p>
               <p>

But the preſent eſtabliſhment of the Church of <hi>England</hi> was not till the 5th year of <hi>Queen</hi> ANNE. And hence it is apparent, that the eſtabliſhment of that Church can never be argued from the common law, even in <hi>England;</hi> nor could be any part of it, ſince it depends not for its validity, upon cuſtom immemorial.—The common law does not conſider any reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious eſtabliſhment whatever, as any part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</q>

               <head>From the PENNSYLVANIA GAZETTE, Nov. 24. The CENTINEL, No. XX.</head>
               <p>INVITED by Dr. Chandler, we have offered to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of the public, ſome of the objections which we have to the propoſed American Epiſcopate, with a moderation and candour, which muſt leave a teſtimony in favour of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel in the breaſt of every perſon, who has taken time to read our papers. We have waited patiently for more than three months, to ſee whether any thing would be ſaid, either by Dr. Chandler, or his friends, that had any tendency to weaken the force of what we have advanced. The Anatomiſt has promiſed ſomething of this kind, but has hitherto entertained us with an unintereſting ſtory, which has no relation to the preſent debate, concerning the expediency of an American Epiſcopate. He has gone as far back as the firſt ſettlement of New-England, and has induſtriouſly waded through Boſton almanacks, unwritten hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and fabulous anecdotes, to find an apology for Dr. Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dler's Appeal to the public, printed about a year ago. It is not a little ſurpriſing, that he was contented with ſo ſhort a period as an hundred years, and that he did not go back to the time of the Reformation, and give us a complete hiſtory of all the objections that have been made to the tyranny, ſuperſtition and perſecutions of the High Flyers of the Church of England, down to the preſent day, in every quarter of the world, that he might abundantly vindicate Dr. Chandler from the charge of beginning the preſent diſpute by his late publication. For doubtleſs all the inſtances of abuſe, which that bulwark of the Reformation has met with from all the <hi>ſhameleſs ſcribblers</hi> ſince the Reformation, who have had the impudence to ſay, that the Church of England ever maintained or practiſed any thing that was wrong, were ſo many arguments to prove that Dr. Chandler had been obliged, in defence of his injured, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted Church, to write his Appeal to the Public. But what ſcandalous trifling with the debate muſt this appear to be to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very unprejudiced perſon? Dr. Chandler, with more honeſty
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:011212_0054_0F862D5CE3706728"/>and candour, explicitly acknowledges that his Appeal was wrote from no ſuch motives. It muſt be confeſſed, that Dr. Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dler knew the motives which induced him to write, and he has honeſtly given them in his introduction, without the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant hint to the things, which the Anatomiſt has alledged as the cauſes of his writing. He has not ſo much as inſinuated, that the perſecutions of the Quakers in New-England, almoſt a century ago, or the neglect of the New-York hiſtorian to give due praiſe to an Epiſcopal Miſſionary, were any of the motives of his writing his Appeal. No ſuch matter. He deſigned it as an apology for his own and his brethren's conduct, in ſending home a number of addreſſes to their ſuperiors, on the ſubject of an American Epiſcopate. Theſe are his words: <q>That appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation has been lately made to our ſuperiors, by the Clergy of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the colonies, requeſting one or more Biſhops to be ſent o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to America, is a matter now generally known, and was never intended to be kept as a ſecret. As there is great rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hope, both from a review of the arguments that were offered in the ſupport of the addreſſes that were tranſmitted on the occaſion, and from the favourable diſpoſition of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in authority, that this requeſt in due time will be granted; it has been thought proper, in a public manner, to inform all, who may imagine themſelves to be any way concerned in the event of our application, candidly and explicitly, for what reaſons, and with what views an American Epiſcopate is ſo earneſtly deſired by the Clergy, and the other friends and members of the Church.</q>—Then, after mentioning the alarm that this conduct of the Clergy had given, he invites all, who had any objections againſt the ſcheme. <q>to propoſe them in ſuch a manner, that they may be fairly and candidly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated before the tribunal of the public; and if none ſhall be offered, it will be taken for granted that all parties ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce, and are ſatisfied<note n="*" place="bottom">

                  </q> Dr Chandler is not aſhamed to acknowledge, and has too much honeſty to deny, that the alarm was given by this conduct of the Epiſcopal Miſſionaries in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the colonies, and wrote his Appeal as an apology for them, with the hopes of removing any uneaſineſs that might remain, and of preventing any oppoſition to the prepoſed plan. What muſt we then think of the ingenuity and veracity of the Anatomiſt, who does not heſitate to ſay, "that Dr. Chandler, far from being the aggreſſor, is only a defendant, in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute which was commenced on the part of the antagoniſts of the Church in New-England" (that is, by the Epiſcopal Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,

                     <hi>Anat. No</hi> 1.</note>.</p>
               <p>This is a ſufficient anſwer to all the Anatomiſt has ſaid in the firſt eight of his numbers, and if he thinks it of importance enough to fill up eight more of his papers with other arguments to vindicate Dr. Chandler from a charge which the Doctor himſelf has honeſtly confeſſed, and can prevail on the public to liſten to ſuch egregious triffling with the debate, he is welcome to try his hand at the buſineſs a ſecond time.</p>
               <p>The Anatomiſt, after he has worn out the patience of his readers in his northern expedition, where, <hi>Quixote</hi> like, he has been fighting with windmills, hobgoblins, gorgons, chimeras and hydras, has at length returned to the place of beginning, without having advanced a ſtep in the debate about importing into the colonies that precious commodity, an American Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate. But to make an atonement for his long and tireſome introduction, he now propoſes, without any farther ceremony or circumlocution, to fall upon the Centinel without remorſe, and cut him up, whether living or dead, with all that inhuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which his art requires. But ſtill, as if he was unwilling to undertake the diſagreeable office, he begins to make excuſes, that he cannot underſtand the <hi>Centinel</hi>'s arguments, or reduce them into any kind of form or connection; and, indeed, he ſuſpects there is ſcarce any thing in his papers that wears the ſemblance of an argument. Some men are ſo blind as not to ſee the force of an argument, from the prejudice of education, and others from a natural defect in their intellects; but, without determining which of theſe may be the caſe with the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, we ſhall endeavour to give him all the aſſiſtance that we can, to encourage him to proceed in the work he has underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and, from time to time, will hold out to his view the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments we have uſed againſt the eſtabliſhment of Biſhops in America, until he has tried his matchleſs proweſs upon them.</p>
               <p>But as the Anatomiſt has ſeen proper to begin with an obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation picked out of the Centinel's 18th number, we ſhall attend him there at preſent, and examine what he has ſaid to ſhew its weakneſs. The Centinel, in that paper, charges Dr. Chandler with a diſingenuous attempt to gild the diſagreeable pill, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſing the laity of his own communion with the inconſiſtent hopes of an exemption from the authority and juriſdiction of the new created Biſhop. Dr. Chandler has ſaid (page 95) that "the American Biſhops are to have no authority, nor indeed
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:011212_0055_0F862D5DDA2CD228"/>to exerciſe any diſcipline over their own people, the Clergy-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted." The Centinel endeavoured kindly to undeceive the people. and to let them know that it was a vain inconſiſtent hope, with which they were flattered, <q>that a Biſhop ſhould have no authority to exerciſe diſcipline over his own people, was inconſiſtent with the known ſentiments of the Church of England, and of every other Chriſtian Church in the world, and a mere <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ovel invention, without any parallel in hiſtory either ſacred or profane, ſince the firſt eſtabliſhment of a church on earth.</q> Both theſe aſſertions the Anatomiſt has ventured to deny. My veracit, to his upon the proof. He has condeſcended to mention only the Church of England, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying that the officers of it have any ſuch power eſſential to their office. He ſays, <q>that it is no doctrine of our Church, as the Centinel would aſſert, that they hold it inſeparable from their office, and immediately of CHRIST. This proud boaſt is indeed made by Independents and Preſbyterians, though they have never yet produced their charter<note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <hi>Anat. No.</hi> 9.</note>
                  </q>. Pray, Sir, does not your Church yearly, in the commination before Lent, ſolemnly confeſs before GOD your want of that godly diſcipline, which prevailed in the pureſt ages of the Church, antecedent to any human eſtabliſhment? And as to the charter of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in the Chriſtian Churches, you may find it recorded, Acts xx, 28, and in the Epiſtles to Timothy and Titus. To ſay that a Chriſtian Miniſter has no power to govern the laity of the Church over which he preſides, is a bold and groundleſs aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and I challenge the Anatomiſt to produce a ſingle writer on Church Government, either in the Epiſcopal or Preſbyterian Churches, beſides himſelf, who has denied the authority of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Biſhops to govern the people of their charge, independent of all ſtate appointments and civil eſtabliſhments whatſoever, but derived to them immediately from JESUS CHRIST, the only head of the Church. What a ſcandalous evaſion then is it for him to quote his Civilian Burn, to prove that the Engliſh Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops derived juriſdiction over the laity in <hi>certain caſes,</hi> by the laws of the kingdom? Could the Anatomiſt perſuade himſelf, that the conſequence would follow from ſuch premiſes, that they had no power to exerciſe diſcipline over the laity in other matters derived to them from CHRIST? Which was the thing he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to prove, in order to invalidate my aſſertion. For the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel, in the place in queſtion, talks of no juriſdiction or autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the laity, but what exiſted in the three firſt centuries,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:011212_0055_0F862D5DDA2CD228"/>and what every Biſhop or Preſbyter had, as eſſential to his office as a paſtor.</p>
               <p>This is the authority and diſcipline which is derived from Chriſt, that is ruined by your oppreſſive Teſt Act in England; this is the diſcipline the Church of England is conſtantly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting the want of, without attempting to reſtore it; this is the diſcipline which Dr. Chandler ſays is not to be reſtored under the new American Epiſcopate; and this is the diſcipline from which the laity of your communion are promiſed an exemption, to make the diſagreeable doſe they are about to ſwallow more palatable. And this doubtleſs is the juriſdiction, for the exerciſe of which the Anatomiſt ſays, "the eſtabliſhed Church of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land has never yet produced their charter;" for he certainly could not mean a different juriſdiction with which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted, as an eſtabliſhment by the laws of the kingdom. What then has the Anatomiſt ſaid to relieve Dr. Chandler, and his brethren, from the charge we have brought againſt him, for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing upon the people with the vain hope of an exemption from the authority and juriſdiction of his new Biſhop? An exempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on never before heard of in any Chriſtian Church, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the known ſentiments of the Church of England, as well as of every other Church in the world. If the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt will take the trouble of reviewing his argument on this head, he will find that the Centinel has been perfectly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with himſelf; and that the Anatomiſt has, either through inattention or deſign, groſly miſrepreſented the Centinel, when he ſays, that Writer contends, "that it is impoſſible for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Miſſionaries in the Colonies, to have ſuch primitive Biſhops (as were in the firſt ages of the Church) becauſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictory to the known ſentiments of the Church of England, and every other ſince the firſt eſtabliſhment of Chriſtianity<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Anat. No.</hi> 10.</note>." The Centinel never ſaid ſuch a thing, never contended for ſuch a thing, either explicitly or implicitly. It is therefore hoped that the Anatomiſt w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> attempt to do juſtice to his own charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, either by a candid acknowledgment, that he has miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the Centinel, or by proving what he has aſſerted. Nay, ſo far is the Centinel from contending for ſuch a thing, that he contends that all your Miſſionaries are ſuch primitive Biſhops as were in the firſt three centuries, that he has not, in the paſſage referred to, ſaid a ſingle word about ſuch a juriſdiction of Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops, as he in other papers juſtly complains of, as dangerous to the civil and religious rights of mankind, but only that Dr. Chandler was much to be blamed for endeavouring to impoſe
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:011212_0056_0F862D5E61F9A5A8"/>on the Laity of his own Church, by giving them the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent hopes of an exemption from ſuch a juriſdiction of Biſhops over them, as was eſſential to their office, and allowed to be ſo, by every Chriſtian Church in the world. This was the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and diſcipline that Dr. Chandler, whom the Centinel was anſwering, ſpoke of, in the paſſages quoted from his Appeal. A little attention and candour, Mr. Anatomiſt, would have ſaved you the labour of compoſing your 9th, 10th and 11th numbers, or at leaſt a very conſiderable part of them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there are two excellent conceſſions in theſe papers, which we hope you will not forget, viz. "That in the three firſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies, the Biſhops had no juriſdiction over the Laity, different from what every Preſbyter had, as eſſential to his office as a paſtor <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Anat. No.</hi> 9.</note>.,' And that neither Timothy nor Titus were Dioceſan Biſhops, but Biſhops at large; nay, that there were no Dioce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan Biſhops originally, till, in proceſs of time, "for greater conveniency and regularity, different Biſhops became fixed to different diſtricts <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Ibid. No.</hi> 10.</note>;" although you had juſt before, in the ſame paper; ſettled his Grace Lord Biſhop Timothy in the Dioceſe of Epheſus, and Lord Biſhop Titus in that of Crete. But leſt you ſhould be called upon to vindicate theſe good Biſhops, from the ſcandalous crime of non reſidency (of which you know they were as notoriouſly guilty as any Biſhops in England) you have ſtripped them of the Dioceſes, which you had, to ſerve a turn, juſt before given them, and turned them out at large, to govern in the Church in general.</p>
               <p>The ableſt advocates for Epiſcopacy, ſuch as Bret, Hoadley, &amp;c. freely acknowledge that Biſhops and Preſbyters, in the New-Teſtament, are ſynonimous terms. And it is well known, that they were inveſted with power by a ſcripture charter, to take heed to themſelves, and to their flock, over which the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt made them Biſhops. And all that are acquainted with the Fathers, or a ſtate of the primitive Church, know well that there were no pluralities in thoſe days, nor had the Biſhops in thoſe days, an overſight of more than the people that received the ſacrament together in one place, and attended public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in one houſe, and Preſbyterian Paſtors or Biſhops, as the Anatomiſt confeſſes them to be, were the New-Teſtament pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Biſhops. The primitive Church exerciſed a ſtrict diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and took a ſpecial care of the morals of their people, by the powers given their paſtors by Jeſus Chriſt, but fines and impriſonments, and penal laws, were left to Dioceſan Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:011212_0056_0F862D5E61F9A5A8"/>and to Church zealots, ſuch as Parker, Whitgift, Laud, and others of their ſtamp.</p>

               <p>IN my laſt number it hath been ſhewn (by arguments which I think all the <hi>Whigs</hi> and <hi>Kickers</hi> and <hi>Centinels</hi> and <hi>Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrants</hi> on this continent, will not be able to invalidate) that a church eſtabliſhment, and eccleſiaſtical courts, having juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion over the laity, cannot by the common law of England, be introduced into America in the perſon of a biſhop; and it hath been my good fortune to be able to confirm this doctrine by the authority of ſome gentlemen, who have long been deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Oracles of the law,</hi> and champions for the <hi>good old cauſe,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Preſbyterian Party.</hi> To what purpoſe then is all the noiſe that has been made on this Head and the pains that have been taken by theſe gentlemen and their adherents to perſuade the people of theſe colonies, that the introduction of Biſhops in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to America, would neceſſarily introduce arbitrary eccleſiaſtical courts, and lead to a general eſtabliſhment of the Epiſcopal church here. Could any thing more be meant by this than to alarm and impoſe on weak minds? Can it be ſuppoſed poſſible that ſuch writers ſhould believe themſelves, when they aſſert tenets ſo directly contrary, not only to the known conſtruction of all law, but to their own avowed principles on every other occaſion? Or can they mean any thing more than to oppreſs and bear down the <hi>Church,</hi> by preventing her from obtaining her juſt &amp; eſſential rights that they may the more eaſily erect a dominion of their own?</p>
               <p>But it may be anſwered, that tho' theſe writers have ſuggeſted their fears, that the aforeſaid grievances would accompany, or ſoon follow, the ſettlement of a Biſhop in America, yet it is no where ſaid by them that the Biſhop would derive his powers from the common law.</p>
               <p>True it is that thoſe writers, and particularly the <hi>Centinel,</hi> have contented themſelves with ſpreading fears and alarms in general, as the eaſieſt way of carrying their ends; and do no
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:011212_0057_0F862D641E6F0FB8"/>where give us the particular grounds of their fears. Had they done this they would have ſhewn themſelves men of candour; the anſwer would have been eaſy, and I ſhould not have been under the neceſſity of conſidering every poſſible ground of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, in order to quiet them. But this taſk hard as it is, I have been obliged to undertake for the ſake of truth and an injured Church; and I propoſe to complete it, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſincerity and fairneſs.</p>
               <p>It hath been already ſaid, that there are only the following ways, in which a biſhop can be inveſted with the <hi>apprehended</hi> powers. He muſt derive them from the <hi>Common Law,</hi> or from <hi>Statute Law;</hi> or judges will be intimidated to wreſt the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent laws in a Biſhop's favour; or ſome new law will be made by the Parliament, or by the colonies. Theſe are all the ways that have been ever ſuggeſted, or which I think can poſſible be conceived. If the Centinel can name any other, I ſhould think myſelf indebted to him for the intelligence.</p>
               <p>The Common Law, I believe, from what has been ſaid, is now out of the queſtion. Let us come to Statute Law, and here the ſame gentlemen that aſſiſted me before, ſhall ſpeak for me again. For ſometimes, <hi>Argumentum ad Hominem,</hi> is the beſt that can be uſed, and no men can be better condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than out of their own mouths.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Independent</hi> Reflector aforeſaid ſays, that the only ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that can be offered with the leaſt plauſibility in favour of an extenſion of the Engliſh church eſtabliſhment to Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, (without which Dioceſan Epiſcopacy, Eccleſiaſtical courts, &amp;c. are chimeras) muſt be founded on the <hi>Common Law,</hi> or the act which eſtabliſheth the Epiſcopal Church in <hi>South Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> previous to the <hi>Union Act.</hi> Having diſpatched what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the common, as in my laſt, this writer proceeds as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth; taking along with his own arguments, thoſe of Mr. <hi>Hobart,</hi> in his <hi>ſecond Addreſs to the Epiſcopal Separation in New-England,</hi> who is complimented with the title, (and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps truly) of an ingenious gentleman.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The act we are now diſputing about, was made in the 5th year of QUEEN ANNE; and is entitled, <hi>an Act for</hi> SECU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RING <hi>the Church of</hi> England, <hi>as by law eſtabliſhed.</hi> The occaſion of the ſtatute was this. The parliament in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> when treating of an <hi>Union</hi> with <hi>England,</hi> were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of its endangering their eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſhment. <hi>Scotland</hi> was to have but a ſmall ſhare in the Legiſlature of Great-Britain, &amp;c.—The <hi>Scots,</hi> therefore, to prevent having their eccleſiaſtical eſtabliſhment repealed in a <hi>Britiſh</hi> parliament, where they might be ſo eaſily outvoted by <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh</hi>
                     <pb n="105" facs="unknown:011212_0057_0F862D641E6F0FB8"/>members, paſſed an act previous to the <hi>Union,</hi> eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Preſbyterian Church,</hi> within the kingdom of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in perpetuity, and made this act an eſſential and fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental part of the Union, which might not be repealed, or altered by any ſubſequent Britiſh parliament. And this put the Engliſh parliament upon paſſing this act for ſecuring the church of England. Neither of them deſigned to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large the bounds of their eccleſiaſtical conſtitution, or extend their eſtabliſhment further than it reached before, but only to <hi>ſecure</hi> and <hi>perpetuate</hi> it in its preſent extent. This is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, not only from the occaſion of the act, but from the charitable temper the Engliſh parliament was under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of, when they paſſed it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The title of the act is exactly agreeable to what we have ſaid of the deſign of it, and of the temper of the parliament that paſſed it. 'Tis entitled, an act not for enlarging, but for <hi>ſecuring</hi> the church of England, and that not in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican plantations, but as it is <hi>now</hi> by law eſtabliſhed; which plainly means no more than to perpetuate it within its anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent boundaries.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The <hi>Proviſion</hi> made in the act itſelf, is well adapted to this deſign; for it enacts, that the act of the 13th. of ELIZA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BETH, and the act of Uniformity, paſſed in the 13th year of CHARLES the II. and all and ſingular other acts of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then in force for the eſtabliſhment and preſervation of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould remain in full force for ever; and that every ſucceeding ſovereign ſhould at his coronation, take and ſubſcribe an oath to maintain and preſerve inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the <hi>ſaid Settlement</hi> of the church of <hi>England, as by law eſtabliſhed,</hi> within the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> thd Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the town of <hi>Berwick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed,</hi> and the territories thereunto belonging. This act does not uſe ſuch expreſſions as would have been proper and even neceſſary, had the deſign been to have made a new eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, but only ſuch as are proper to ratify and confirm an old one. The ſettlement which the King is ſworn to preſerve, is repreſented as exiſting previous to the paſſing this act, and not as made by it. The words of the oath are, <hi>to maintain and preſerve inviolably the ſaid ſettlement.</hi> If it be aſked, <hi>what Settlement?</hi> The anſwer muſt be, a ſettlement hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made and confirmed by certain ſtatutes, which for the greater certainty and ſecurity are enumerated in this act, and and declared to be unalterable. This is the ſettlement the King is ſworn to preſerve, and this ſettlement has no relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:011212_0058_0F862D64E6E35A50"/>on to us in <hi>America;</hi> for the act which originally made it, did not reach hither, and this act which perpetuates them, does not extend them to us.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The writer then proceeds to ſhew, "that it is a miſtake to imagine the word <hi>Territories</hi> (in the title of the act) was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to comprehend the colonies, but only the iſlands of <hi>Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey</hi> and <hi>Guernſey,</hi> which were properly ſuch" territories de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the immediate government of England, as fully ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the words in the ſaid title. "It is, ſays he, the invaria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble practice of the Legiſlature, in every act of parliament, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to affect us, to uſe the words <hi>Colonies</hi> or <hi>Plantations;</hi> nor is it to be ſuppoſed, that in ſo important a matter (as the extenſion of the Engliſh Church eſtabliſhment, its eccleſiaſtical laws, &amp;c.) words of ſo direct and broad an intent would have been omitted."</p>
               <p>This reaſoning is ſufficiently concluſive; and certain it is that no Britiſh act, ſince we had Legiſlatures of our own, hath been conſidered to bind the colonies, unleſs they were expreſsly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Now moſt of our colony ligiſlatures exiſted long before this act of Queen <hi>Anne.</hi> More than 60 years have ſince elapſed, and in no part of America hath ever this act been pleaded as the leaſt foundation for any church eſtabliſhment, but where ever ſuch eſtabliſhment hath taken place, colony laws hath been made for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>If then, neither from this act, nor any other Britiſh ſtatute, the leaſt parochial eſtabliſhment, <hi>Tythe,</hi> or temporal advantage, can be claimed in favour of a Preſbyter of the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, more than any other Preſbyter in the colonies; how could it be poſſible from <hi>Statute Law</hi> to plead an eſtabliſhment of Dioceſan epiſcopacy and eccleſiaſtical courts? No one believes this poſſible; nay not even thoſe who at preſent think proper to alarm their followers with the notion of it.</p>
               <p>Since then, neither <hi>common</hi> nor <hi>ſtatute</hi> laws that are, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny colony law can veſt <hi>American</hi> Biſhops with the powers in queſtion; all other ground of clamour muſt reſt in the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of theſe writers themſelves; and till they will favour us with the cauſe and nature of their apprehenſions, it will not be eaſy to remove them. Here then I might drop my pen, were it not on account of ſome well meaning people who are impoſed upon by their crafty leaders, and on whoſe account a few papers more may not be unneceſſary.</p>
               <p>POSTSCRIPT. Since the above went to the preſs, I have ſeen a paper called the <hi>Centinel,</hi> No. 20. which is the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt jumble of miſrepreſentation and unworthy argument, that ever came from a writer, affecting candour. I ſhall ſubjoin a
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:011212_0058_0F862D64E6E35A50"/>few remarks on ſome parts of it, for it is in general below notice.</p>
               <p>He ſays, I have gone back to the firſt ſettlement of New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to find an apology for Dr. Chandler's appeal.— Now I ſaid at firſt, that if Dr. Chandler ſtood in need of any apology, he was able to make it for himſelf, that my deſign was of another nature, and that I went ſo far back, to ſhew what ſort of ſpirit the antagoniſts of the church in America had poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed from the beginning; and that the few writers on behalf of the church in the colonies, Dr. C. as well as others, had ever been acting on the <hi>defenſive,</hi> far from being <hi>aggreſſors</hi> in this, or any former diſpute. And I need not repent the ſhort review I took, as it has opened the eyes of many.</p>
               <p>He ſays "the neglect of a New-York hiſtorian to give due praiſe to one miſſionary" is aſſigned by me as another cauſe of Dr. Chandler's appeal. I have indeed, as part of my plan, to ſhew the temper of our antagoniſts, convicted a New-York hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian of palpable falſhoods, not only concerning one miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but the ſociety in England, and many miſſionaries; but ſaid not a word of this being the cauſe of Dr. Chandler's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal.</p>
               <p>He ſays further, "that I undertook to prove, that Biſhops had no power to exerciſe diſcipline over the laity in matters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to them from Chriſt." Now I have no where undertaken any ſuch thing, but appeal to every reader whether I have not carefully diſtinguiſhed between the powers both of order and government that are <hi>eſſential</hi> to the epiſcopal office, as derived immediately from Chriſt; and thoſe <hi>adventitious</hi> powers, deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from human laws. The former powers are what we have all along been contending for, as what our church is entitled to in common with all others, whether lodged in <hi>one,</hi> or in <hi>many.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He ſays I confeſs Preſbyterian paſtors to be Biſhops.— "Now I have ſaid <hi>they like to be ſo called,</hi> but have confeſſed nothing in their favour. On the contrary I have declared my belief, "that there has conſtantly been in the church of Chriſt, a ſucceſſion of men with powers of ordination and government ſuperior to Preſbyters."</p>
               <p>He charges me with giving Timothy a Dioceſe, and then ſtripping him of it. My words are, that Timothy's charge, which was <hi>Epheſus more particularly,</hi> "was not properly <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan,</hi>" as he was not reſtricted to exerciſe office there only, "but might ordain and govern in the church in general for the more ſpeedy propagation of Chriſtianity." Theſe words were well weighed and can be well defended. As to the ſneer
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:011212_0059_0F862D6528B24A08"/>Timothy's <hi>Non-Reſidence,</hi> it is too low even to provoke a ſmile; for when he went to diſtant places for the purpoſes of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the church, or for the ordination of Biſhops and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, it no more diſſolved his particular connection with the Epheſians, or made him chargeable with <hi>Non-Reſidence,</hi> than our <hi>would-be</hi> Preſbyterian Biſhops are chargeable with <hi>Non-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence,</hi> and their connection with their congregations diſſolved, when they <hi>gad about</hi> to Synods and Preſbyteries in diſtant places and diſtant provinces, during long months, for the purpoſes of ordination and government, in their way.</p>
               <p>I have but a remark or two more. The Centinel ſays, "he never contended that it is impoſſible for the epiſcopal miniſters to have primitive Biſhops," that (is as he explains it a few lines further) Biſhops without the juriſdiction he elſewhere complains of; for that in the paſſage referred to, he ſays not a ſingle word about ſuch juriſdiction."—</p>
               <p>Surely this writer forgets his own words.—"Many members (ſays he) of the epiſcopal communion deteſt <hi>Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Domination,</hi> and are as tenacious as others of their civil and religious liberty."—And then adds, "leſt theſe ſhould op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the ſcheme of introducing theſe new maſters, they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſed with the <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> hopes of being entirely exempted from their juriſdiction. Now I would aſk what juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction can be here meant—but the ſpiritual domination juſt mentioned and connected with the whole ſentence; that <hi>Domination</hi> which laymen tenacious of civil and religious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would oppoſe? If this is not the juriſdiction the Centinel was complaining of, he has been complaining of nothing.</p>
               <p>And now, tedious as the Centinel thinks I have been, (tho' yet little more than half as tedious as himſelf) I have brought the matter to this ſhort iſſue; which if he evades, he will give me leave to uſe ſome of his own polite phraſes, and cry out in my turn, "egregious triffling, ſcandalous, evaſion, &amp;c!"</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. Either the juriſdiction he has been clamouring againſt is what he confeſſes, "eſſential to the office of Biſhops, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo to be by every Chriſtian church." And then let him give me a reaſon why the church of England in America, may not have that juriſdiction agreeable to her own way? Or—</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. The juriſdiction he means is that <hi>adventitious</hi> autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity given to Dioceſan Biſhops by human laws. And then let him ſhew from what law that now is, ſuch juriſdiction can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to a Biſhop in America.</p>

               <p>THE prieſts in Spain, in order to rivet the prejudices of their party againſt the <hi>reformed religion,</hi> once told the people that <hi>proteſtants</hi> were not like <hi>catholics,</hi> but had heads like <hi>dogs</hi> and other furious animals.</p>
               <p>Juſt ſuch a piece of art our Centinel ſeems to have uſed, in order to terrify the good people of America in regard to Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops. For he uſhers in his very firſt paper into the world with the following prepoſterous picture from Horace, viz.
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>Humano capiti, cirvicem pictor equinam</hi>

                  </q> And endeavours, through all his ſucceeding numbers, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <hi>prelates</hi> as <hi>monſters,</hi> more frightful and dangerous than thoſe of the Spaniſh prieſts. Every thing that could be judged exceptionable in the character of Biſhops that lived a century ago, is collected as it were into one character for our American Biſhop; and then it is modeſtly hinted, that if ſuch a creature ſhould be let looſe in America, he would devour all before him; or as the Centinel himſelf has it, would "deſtroy our charters, laws, conſtitutions, and threaten us with the ſtill further loſs of our civil and religious liberties."</p>
               <p>Every reader would imagine that the Centinel had ſome good foundation for ſuch a terrible alarm—"of the loſs of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and religious liberty," by the power of an American Biſhop. It might be thought that ſuch power could be grounded on ſome law, but I have ſhewn that there is no ſuch thing poſſible. Or, again it might be thought at leaſt that the plan of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican Epiſcopate itſelf, propoſed ſome ſuch power; but quite the reverſe is the caſe, and it is high time that this plan was now laid before the reader; who will be greatly ſurpriſed to find it the moſt innocent thing, inſtead of being the moſt dangerous. In ſhort, the whole power propoſed for an American Biſhop, (and all he can poſſibly exerciſe conſiſtent with our laws) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:011212_0060_0F862D65F05CAD20"/>to no more than is daily exerciſed by any five or ſix of our clamorous adverſaries, within their bounds, in <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery met.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The plan for an American Biſhop, which the Centinel moſt diſingenuouſly ſtrives to perſuade the public is a <hi>"novel inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion"</hi> ſet on foot by a few American clergy, at this particular time for particular purpoſes, is notwithſtanding a pretty <hi>old in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention,</hi> ſet on foot in no times of trouble or diſtreſs, and firſt drawn up by no American clergyman, but by an Engliſh Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, in whoſe favour, even Dr. <hi>Mayhew</hi> has made an <hi>aberrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> into candour; and forgetting his uſual Biſhop-baiting hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, declares him a prelate who was a great ornament of the Epiſcopal order, and of the Church of England."</p>
               <p>It is the good <hi>Biſhop Butler</hi> we ſpeak of, who in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of Boſton.</p>
               <p n="1">"1. No coercive power is deſired over the laity in any caſe; but only a power to regulate the behaviour of the clergy who are in Epiſcopal orders; and to correct and puniſh them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the law of the Church of England, in caſe of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>behaviour or neglect of duty; with ſuch power as <hi>commiſſaries</hi> abroad have formerly exerciſed; (over the clergy in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies.)</p>
               <p n="2">"2. Nothing is deſired for ſuch <hi>Biſhops,</hi> that may in the leaſt interfere with the dignity or authority, or <hi>intereſt</hi> of the GOVERNORS, or any other officers of State.

And all theſe great Prelates, who certainly knew the principles of the Church of England as well as the Centinel, thought it not in the leaſt "inconſiſtent with her principles," to have an American Biſhop, merely "for ordaining Miniſters, confirming youth, and viſiting our own Clergy," without any government whatſoever over the Laity, leaving each congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be governed, in its ſpiritual affairs, by its own <hi>Preſbyter,</hi> aſſiſted by Veſtries, as at preſent.</p>

               <p>What then can be the ground of the Centinel's apprehenſion of the deſtruction of our "charters, laws, and very conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions" by the introduction of a Biſhop?

                  </q> that "many" (he might have ſaid the far greateſt part) of the Church clergy are advocates for "Toleration;" that "the wings of high-flyers are cropt;" that they are not <q>allowed to exerciſe the powers they claim; but are limitted by the ſalutary reſtraints of ſome modern Statutes</q>—I ſay, if he be in earneſt in theſe aſſertions, which, indeed, the invincible force of truth, and facts notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, ſeem to have extorted from him; then he hath the very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity he deſires—a ſecurity <hi>more ſubſtantial than the word</hi> of an hundred Dr. <hi>Chandlers</hi>—even a ſecurity equal to what we have for life, limb and property, viz, the faith of government, and the ſanctity of law and charters. For if "the ſalutary reſtraints of modern Statutes" are able to prevent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, and ſecure liberty of conſcience in a country where Biſhops are clothed with legal powers; what can be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended from them in a country where the ſame laws for liberty of conſcience have their fulleſt force, and yet no law that can veſt a Biſhop with the leaſt temporal power over the Laity doth extend?</p>
               <p>But altho' this be demonſtrably true; and altho' the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel, by his own conceſſions, hath cut himſelf out of every ground of <hi>apprehenſion;</hi> yet, for all this, he will be <hi>apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi> ſtill—<q>Suppoſing (ſays he) theſe Biſhops ſent over with theſe limitted powers, is there any probability they will remain <hi>content</hi> with them?</q> Juſt ſuch another queſtion as this did our Centinel's great Prototype, Dr. <hi>Mayhew</hi> put, upon being told that the "Biſhops are now, and have long been, as quiet an order of men as any in the nation."—But who knows whether they will continue ſo? And the ſame anſwer that was given Dr. <hi>Mayhew,</hi> will ſerve his diſciple, the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel.—Who can know with certainty any ſuch thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any perſon whatſoever?" Who knows whether the
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:011212_0062_0F862D6764529968"/>New-Englanders (whoſe wings were once cropt by the loſs of their ancient charter, &amp;c.) will remain <hi>content</hi> with their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent reſtricted powers, and will not again hang <hi>Quakers, Witches,</hi> &amp;c? Who knows whether Diſſenters, either in Old or New-England, will be <hi>content</hi> long without overſetting again the conſtitution both in church and ſtate: Who knows whether they will not again erect a common wealth?—And again lead their king.—</p>
               <p>But I forbear purſuing this argument for the preſent; as it might juſtly be replied, that there is no reaſon to ſuppoſe any ſuch things; the times and tempers of men being much changed—Why then may not the ſame reply be admitted on our ſide? What ſignifies it to ſay that a Biſhop in America will not be long <hi>contented</hi> with limitted powers, any more than to ſay, that independents, &amp;c. will not be long contented with them? Are our laws and conſtitutions, and charters to be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled for the <hi>contentment</hi> of either ſide? And certainly this muſt be done before either can exerciſe the leaſt eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction over the other.</p>
               <p>For ſhame! that people cannot argue, as they would wiſh to be argued with, Is it fair, is it brotherly in any ſett of men, to keep up an eternal clamour, in order to deprive their fellow proteſtants of a natural right, merely on account of old grudges, that ought long ſince to have been done away; or on account of groundleſs fears, concerning what <hi>may,</hi> or never <hi>may</hi> happen?</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Mayhew,</hi> on further conſideration, ſaw the unfairneſs of ſuch a conduct, and in his ſecond piece ſays—<q>It is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily owned that our <hi>apprehenſions</hi> of what may <hi>poſſibly</hi> or <hi>probably</hi> be the conſequence of ſending Biſhops to America, ought not to put us on infringing the religious liberty of our fellow ſubjects, and Chriſtian brethren; neither have we any power to do ſo, if we were unreaſonable and wicked enough to deſire it, our charter granting ſuch liberty <hi>to all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>If the Centinel could have the virtue to make the like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, it might bring this diſpute to a ſpeedy concluſion. But if groundleſs jealouſies and clamours (about <hi>contigencies</hi> ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely <hi>improbable</hi> and only <hi>poſſible</hi> to happen on a diſſolution of all law and equity) are to be ſtill thrown out, in bar of our juſt rights; it is high time that our jealouſies ſhould have vent alſo; and that we ſhould make it appear, as we juſtly can, that if the religious rights of <hi>Americans</hi> are ever like to be in danger from any ſett of men, it is from theſe our anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſts themſelves; and that other denominations in America
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:011212_0062_0F862D6764529968"/>can have no ſecurity againſt their aſpiring temper, but from the Church of England being conſtantly in a condition to balance their power, and to keep pace with their growth.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I Congratulate you on your eſcape from the bloody knife of the Anatomiſt, who, after paying his viſit to the <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>The town of Boſton deſired the clergy to ſet apart a day of ſolemn faſting and prayer; which requeſt was cheerfully complied with by every denomination except Epiſcopalians.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>patrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic</hi> Epiſcopalians of Boſton, and <hi>diſſecting</hi> a <hi>Watch-Tower</hi> in New-York, intended to have ſeized you in your ſleep, cut you up alive as you were, and expoſed you as a ſcare-crow to fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his oppoſers into a tame ſubmiſſion to his darling Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate. I am an entire ſtranger to your perſon, and know not whether you be a Preſbyterian or Quaker, Independent or Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalian farther than as appears from your writings; yet the cauſe of truth makes me your friend, in oppoſition to ſome ambitious ſpirits, who have been feaſting their fancies that the day is dawning, when the knowledge of epiſcopacy ſhall ſpread through the land, and an American Biſhop ſhining in full ſplendour, ſhall gild and gladden nations with his beams.</p>
               <p>The memorable Appeal has long ſince made its appearance in this new world: by ſome it was viewed as a portentous ſtranger, foreboding all the horrors of eccleſiaſtical tyranny; by others as a ſpecimen of Church moderation and lenity; and by all acknowledged to have the cunning of the ſerpent, as well as the harmleſſneſs of the dove. Various have been the refutations of that celebrated performance, to the no ſmall ſatisfaction of all moderate men, and the laſting vexation and anguiſh of our American Tories, who, in the agony of their ſpirits, talk of "reſiſtance unto blood," and conſequently of dying martyrs in the wild cauſe of their good maſter ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellant.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="unknown:011212_0063_0F862D684991CC70"/>So copious of abſurdities and contradictions, ſo abundant in reflections on his oppoſers, is Dr. Chandler's appeal to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, that no withſtanding all that has been ſaid in reply, there is ſtill remaining ſo much worthy of animadverſion that vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes might be written, and his Majeſty's liege ſubjects might ſtill be diverted for ages yet to come.</p>
               <p>Moſt unfavourable are the times for ſuch controverſies, and every friend to liberty muſt lament that a number of ambitious miſſionaries could raiſe ſo diſagreeable a diſpute, when our pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic affairs call for the cloſeſt union in councils and uniformity in meaſures. It is to be hoped however, as the Anatomiſt "ſcorns to fall to ſlaſhing without calling one to ſtand on one's guard," that he will deſiſt from his purpoſe and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to heal the wounds he may have made, provided it can be made appear that Doctor <hi>Chandler</hi> "<hi>was</hi> the aggreſſor" in this diſpute about Biſhops—that "Dr. Chandler <hi>had</hi> a general commiſſion from his own brethren" the clergy of New-York and New-Jerſey, and, if his own words are true, and we underſtand the terms <hi>commiſſion</hi> and <hi>repreſentation</hi> as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention did—that Doctor Chandler "had a commiſſion from the Church," and is therefore, in the ſame ſenſe, "the Church of England" itſelf, and conſequently much more than "the ten thouſandth part of it." All which I now undertake to prove, although the Anatomiſt denies it, and has the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to ſay "this is not pretended." I will alſo ſhow that 'tis falſe to ſay Doctor Chandler has given no provocation" for "the treatment he has met with," as the Anatomiſt boldly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts is the caſe. I will prove too that the Doctor has "ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered" much more than "a ſingle word, reflecting on the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples" not only "of any" but of every "proteſtant denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion" on the continent, not even ſparing his own, eſpecially the unlucky laity.</p>
               <p>In the proſecution of this plan I ſhall take the following things for granted, which none, except the Anatomiſt, will venture to deny: 1. That Doctor Chandler knew what was his deſign in writing his Appeal better than the Anatomiſt can be ſuppoſed to do: And 2.

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> proceed to prove. 1ſt. That Doctor Chandler, far from being a defendant in any diſpute commenced againſt his Church, is in fact the aggreſſor. But here, Sir, I find myſelf antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated in your laſt week's paper, and ſhall only refer your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's to the Doctor's <hi>dedication, advertiſement to the reader,</hi>
                  <pb n="117" facs="unknown:011212_0063_0F862D684991CC70"/>and <hi>introduction</hi> to the Appeal, for a full confirmation of this point. I ſhall here only preſent to view what the Doctor ſays in his <hi>advertiſement to the public</hi> in the Pennſylvania Journal, No. 13<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>1. <q>The principal deſign of the appeal (ſays he) was to <hi>aſſign</hi> the <hi>reaſons</hi> for which the members of the Church of England in America are deſirous of having Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops to reſide in this country, to <hi>ſtate</hi> and <hi>explain</hi> the <hi>plan</hi> on which alone American Biſhops have been propoſed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted, and to obviate and confute the objections that <hi>might be ſuppoſed to ariſe in the minds</hi> of any againſt ſuch an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopate.</q> Where is there in all this or any other part of his writings any hint of entering into any commenced con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy? How then could the Anatomiſt utter ſo falſe an aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? I now defy him and his aſſociates to produce a ſingle ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the body of the appeal that has the leaſt appearance of a ſet defence againſt any New England antagoniſts. So far from it, that the Doctor's profeſſed deſign is to explain what himſelf ſeems to acknowledge, and is now univerſally known, was "kept as a ſecret." So far from it, that he appears ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſurpriſed that any "perſons are" even "ſaid to be alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at this conduct of the clergy. He goes farther, he ſays that <q>when the caſe is duly explained and underſtood, it is not apprehended that <hi>any</hi> oppoſition <hi>can be formed</hi> againſt the execution of a plan ſo reaſonable,</q> &amp;c. This ſame plan, to <hi>explain</hi> which is the <hi>expreſs</hi> deſign of the appeal, the Doctor always mentions as a matter the public did not underſtand, which had never been debated, and for a thorough diſcuſſion of which <q>all are invited to propoſe their objections, that they may be fairly and candidly debated before the tribunal of the public.</q> If therefore it fully appears that Doctor Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dler is not a defendant in any diſpute commenced againſt his Church, pray Mr. Anatomiſt, who was the aggreſſor? and how ridiculouſly have you ſpent your time in writing ſeven long papers to prove a point in which you are ſo flatly contradicted by the author of the Appeal, who without doubt muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to know beſt his own deſign in writing it?—But ſuppoſe Doctor Chandler had been only a defendant in this diſpute, does he not invite all to propoſe their objections, and can the Centinel be blamed for accepting the challenge? I cannot but obſerve here the Doctor's craft. Notwithſtanding this his ſeemingly fair invitation to a fair and candid debate before the public tribunal, he takes care previouſly to brand any that might oppoſe him with the name of perſecutors. <q>Every oppoſition to ſuch a plan (ſays help. 82) has the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of perſecution, and deſerves the name:</q> Nay he goes
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:011212_0064_0F862D68E3C71690"/>farther he calls it "perſecuting them for their religious princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples," and that too "when no reaſons of ſtate require it;" and at laſt he boldly pronounces it "perſecution in the ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and propereſt ſenſe." Under penalty of ſo heavy a charge who would have ventured to attack the Doctor? But greater evils await our ſilence. He tells us (p. 2) "if no objections ſhall be offered it will be taken for granted that all parties ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce and are ſatisfied." A fine dilemma,—to oppoſe the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of a Biſhop, is perſecution: not to oppoſe it, is to acquieſce and be ſatisfied with it! Surpriſing! that a man muſt be thought ſatisfied with whatever he does not oppoſe, and what he has perhaps never heard of. I am apt to imagine that the Doctor is by this time pretty well convinced, that if all that were diſſatisfied with his ſcheme were to oppoſe him, he would bring the whole continent about his ears.</p>
               <p>I am next to ſhew that Dr. Chandler had a general commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from his brethren the clergy of New-York and New-Jerſey, and, in the convention's ſenſe of the terms <hi>commiſſion</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation,</hi> that Dr. Chandler had a commiſſion from the church, and is therefore in the ſame ſenſe of the terms before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, the church of England itſelf, and conſequently much more than the ten thouſandth part of it. Firſt then, that Dr. Chandler had a general commiſſion from his brethren, appears from his own words in his <hi>advertiſement to the reader;</hi> where he tells us, as an apology for the Appeal, <q>that he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted by many of his brethren to undertake it—that the taſk was firſt impoſed upon him by the very worthy and Revd. Dr. Johnſon, of Stratford, in Connecticut;</q> and adds that "at the time when this treaty," as he pompouſly calls it, <q>was nearly concluded, the clergy of New-York and New-Jerſey, aſſiſted by ſome of their brethren from the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provinces took into conſideration, &amp;c. And after a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough diſcuſſion of the point, they were unanimouſly of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that fairly to explain the plan, &amp;c. was a matter of neceſſity and duty. It was accordingly voted (ſays he) that ſomething to this purpoſe ſhould be publiſhed and the <hi>author</hi> was <hi>appointed</hi> to the ſervice.</q> Here we have an <hi>expreſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment</hi> from the convention: and it appears they were ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and almoſt laid their commands on him: <q>excuſes (ſays the Doctor) were not admitted, and a refuſal could not be juſtified.</q> So far was the Doctor from acting in diſconnection with the convention, that he tells us <q>he was careful to follow the directions he had received, and to conſult the moſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of his friends in regard to the method and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the work.</q> Hence it appears that the Dr. had not only a commiſſion for, but direction in his publication, and
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:011212_0064_0F862D68E3C71690"/>that the appeal is the product of the united efforts of the Right Reverendly inclined clergy of the provinces of York and Jerſey in full convention met.</p>
               <p>It muſt be allowed, by the members of the convention at leaſt, that they have acted (whether lawfully or not, I leave themſelves to determine) as the repreſentatives of all the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians on the continent. This they muſt allow, or highly condemn their own conduct, in ſending over no leſs than ſeven petitions in the name of near a million of Epiſcopalians, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in including eight hundred and forty four thouſand negroes, all of whom Dr. Chandler repreſents as at leaſt virtual mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the church of England, though he at the ſame time acknowledges that <q>many of theſe it is to be feared are not Chriſtians at all.</q> Now as the convention are, in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative capacity (ſo often made uſe of in their petitions) the church of England in America (as they phraſe it) then Dr. Chandler in the ſame ſenſe, as their repreſentative in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, is the convention, and therefore is in like manner the church of England itſelf, and conſequently much more than the ten thouſandth part of it. <hi>Quod erat demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrandum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is hoped the reſpectable laity, who have been ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed by the Doctor, and the unambitious clergymen of that church, will not be offended at the liberty here taken in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the convention as their repreſentatives, as they may be aſſured nothing farther is intended than to treat with the Dr. and his brethren of the convention, in the ſtyle they are found to uſe and have aſſumed in their ſeven petitions. We as fully diſbelieve their preſent right to act in the name of the American Epiſcopalians, as the Epiſcopalians themſelves can do, and we hope never to be ſuſpected to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Mr. Centinel, if you think this worthy of a place in your papers, I ſhall write to you again, and intend in my next to ſhew the Anatomiſt, that Dr. Chandler has given great provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and reflected highly on every proteſtant denomination on the continent, not even ſparing his own church, and that you are therefore entirely juſtifiable in defending their injured cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.</p>

               <p>IN anſwer to what is called the Centinel's arguments, which conſiſt chiefly of vain ſurmiſes, I have ſhewn in part, and may perhaps ſhew more at large, that if the faults of former times are to be again brought to view, there is no people on earth whoſe intolerant, perſecuting, aſpiring ſpirit ought more juſtly to be dreaded by all proteſtants, than his own party; who although they are of various ſects, and their <hi>heads</hi> look different ways, yet, like <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s foxes, their <hi>tails</hi> have always been <hi>joined,</hi> to carry fire-brands into the corn-fields and vineyards of their neithbours.</p>
               <p>The diſtinction hath been ſufficiently made between thoſe powers of government, eſſential to every Chriſtian Church; and thoſe adventitious powers derived from human laws. The <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> the Church of England is entitled to, in common with all other churches here. And the <hi>latter,</hi> (it hath been demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſhewn) an American Biſhop cannot enjoy, till our laws, charters, and conſtitutions are firſt totally ſet aſide. To ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, then, that all this will be done, and to offer it as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument for denying us a juſt and natural right, is too futile to deſerve further notice.

<pb n="121" facs="unknown:011212_0065_0F862D6DE837FD70"/>to wreſt the laws, &amp;c. is equally abſurd, and admits of the like anſwer, viz. that no men ought to be deprived of their rights on account of the bare ſurmiſes of others. It was formerly more than ſurmiſed that <hi>Preſbytery</hi> could never be ſafe in <hi>Scotland,</hi> if <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> was ſuffered in <hi>England;</hi> and yet time has ſhewn that this was a groundleſs as well as uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preſumption. If the laws of the land will not bind Judges as well as Biſhops. I can offer no further ſecurity for either, unleſs I was to adviſe our antagoniſts to do with the former, as it is ſaid ſome of them have threatened to do with the latter, viz.—"to throw them into the firſt river or ditch, when they violate the laws.</p>
               <p>By the plan for an American Epiſcopate, which hath been fairly publiſhed, no other power is deſired than that of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, confirmation, and ſuch government of the clergy as is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Church and the laws of canonical obedience. As to the laity, it hath been again and again ſhewn, that no law in force in theſe colonies, can give a Biſhop any power over them greater than every Preſbyter of every denomination hath over his own paſtoral charge. And if the laws in being are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit enough on this head, we have no objection, if every aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of every colony, ſhould by new laws, tie our Biſhop hand and foot, if they think it neceſſary, provided they leave him thoſe powers mentioned above, which are on all ſides (confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation excepted) judged eſſential to a Chriſtian church; and which our church thinks proper to place in a <hi>ſingle</hi> perſon, and not in <hi>many.</hi> As to any natural diſpoſition in epiſcopalians more than in others, to violate laws, I think the whole world, one party excepted, will acquit them; and for <hi>one</hi> violation of law by Epiſcopalians, I am ready, if deſired, to produce <hi>ten</hi> on the ſide of that party themſelves, where ever they had power.</p>

                  <pb n="122" facs="unknown:011212_0066_0F862D6F395D7490"/>Having made this brief recapitulation of what has been the ſubſtance of ſundry of my former papers, I now follow the <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel</hi> to ſome other parts of his performance. For not content with the hideous character he has given us of the Biſhops and government of our Church, he hath, with a ſpirit and charity, becoming—himſelf, in order ſtill better to carry his point, thought fit to vilify our <hi>Church</hi> itſelf, as ſcarce fit to be tolerated in a <hi>proteſtant</hi> land, having "corrupted and obſcured the pure word of God with human inventions."</p>
               <p>I have more than once had occaſion to complain of the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinel for laying down his charges and aſſertions in a way ſo looſe, general and unmanly, that they will ſcarce admit of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar anſwer. Thus he acted in ſpreading his <hi>general</hi> alarm about American Biſhops. He gave us no particular grounds of his fears, ſo that I was forced to conſider every poſſible ground. The ſame way he acts here. He does not tell what thoſe "hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man inventions are, wherewith our Church hath corrupted and obſcured the pure word of God;" and I am left to gueſs whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he means in point of <hi>Epiſcopal government</hi> itſelf, or in rites, ceremonies, and points of doctrine. But if we examine the field from whence his generous hand hath culled ſome of its choiceſt flowers to deck the Church with, we may preſume that the whole together, our diſcipline, government, rites, &amp;c. are a <hi>ſmoak</hi> in his <hi>noſtrils,</hi> like as they were in the <hi>noſtrils</hi> of the old calumniators he hath copied; and that he is afraid of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing funked to death with the rank ſmell which they retain of the ancient whore!</p>
               <p>To general charges, in this caſe, it may be ſufficient to give general anſwers; and to make <hi>one appeal to the</hi> CHURCH <hi>of</hi> PROTESTANTS, to ſee how ſhe hath expreſſed herſelf;—1ſt. Concerning epiſcopal government;—2d. Concerning the rites, ceremonies, and doctrines of the CHURCH of ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND. If the Centinel (as my Latin motto hath it) <hi>will not hear truth,</hi> from thoſe <hi>reformed Churches</hi> abroad, whom he muſt conſider by his own principles, as <hi>friends,</hi> nearly allied to his own party, <hi>I muſt deſpair</hi> of his conviction.</p>
               <p>This appeal may be unneceſſary of thoſe who have the books from which the Centinel hath <hi>kuckſtered</hi> out his ſcandal, or the anſwers that hath been given by learned divines of the Church of England. But the generality of readers, in this country may not have either the one or the other. They may not know that the Centinel's villainous charge againſt the Church, of having "corrupted and obſcured the pure word of
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:011212_0066_0F862D6F395D7490"/>God with human inventions, hath been anſwered over and over again, and ſtands refuted by the teſtimonies of almoſt every <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> denomination of Chriſtians upon earth, except a few reſtleſs <hi>fanatics</hi> in our own country. It is fit, therefore, ſince this writer hath raked up this charge again from the old lumber of refuted pamphlets, that inquiſitive readers, churchmen, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, ſhould be ſatisfied on this head, leſt impudent aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould paſs for truth on the one ſide, and ſilence be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as inability to anſwer, on the other.</p>
               <p>As to the order and inſtitution of Biſhops, and government by them, I am now to corroborate what I have ſaid in my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer papers, by the teſtimonies of the <hi>reformed</hi> abroad; and then proceed to give the like teſtimonies with reſpect to rites, ceremonies, and the purity of the doctrines of our Church; for if the Centinel could ſucceed in damning her whole reputation as yet <hi>impure</hi> and <hi>unreformed,</hi> it would be needleſs to hold any long conteſt about Biſhops, or any thing elſe that concerns ſuch a Church.</p>
               <p>And now let us hear the ſentiments of the firſt reformers, and and ſee whether they agree with our Centinel, in conſidering Biſhops as monſters, and Epiſcopal government as dreadful, anti-Chriſtian, "the yoke of bondage," &amp;c.</p>
               <p>LUTHER expreſſes great veneration for <hi>Prelacy,</hi> and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes betwixt popiſh tyrants and <hi>true Biſhops,</hi> profeſſing <q>that he had no difference with them as <hi>Biſhops,</hi> but as <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh,</hi> and ZANCHI (the compiler of the Gallican confeſſion) obſerves a change of <hi>name,</hi> rather than of office, in the <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintendents</hi> and <hi>general ſuperintendents</hi> of the <hi>German</hi> Churches, theſe being only <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Arch-Biſhops</hi> under diſguiſed names,</q> and he acknowledges further, that <q>by the conſent of hiſtories, councils, and ancient fathers, thoſe orders have been generally allowed by all Chriſtian ſocieties, that Epiſcopacy is agreeable to the word of God:—that where it is in exerciſe it ought to be continued, and where by violence it hath been aboliſhed, it ought to be reſtored<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>CALVIN recommends the Hierarchy to the king of Poland; and ſays that <q>the ancient government by <hi>Arch-biſhops</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and the Nicence conſtitution of <hi>Patriarchs</hi> was for orders ſake and good government.</q>—The ſame great man,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:011212_0067_0F862D700B79DDC0"/>in his treatiſe concerning the neceſſity of the reformation, ſays—<q>Give us ſuch an hierarchy, in which Biſhops preſide, who are ſubject to Chriſt, and <hi>him alone,</hi> as their only head, and then I will own no curſe too bad for him that ſhall not pay the utmoſt reſpect to ſuch an hierarchy as this.</q> And when he was called to an account by Cardinal <hi>Sadolet</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Geneva</hi> defection, and for ſubſcribing the <hi>Auguſtan con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> he repeats, that he <q>ſhould think every man deſerving the worſt curſe who would not be ſubject to ſuch an hierarchy as that above.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now ſuch an hierarchy as this, is what hath been propoſed to take place in the Epiſcopal Churches in the colonies; for the words of Calvin—"Biſhops ſubject to Chriſt alone"—do not mean Biſhops who reject the ſupremacy of the ſtate, wherein they live, with reſpect to <hi>affairs</hi> eccleſiaſtical, under Chriſt; but ſuch as deny their ſubjection to the <hi>Pope,</hi> as the ſole ſpiritual head of the Church, &amp;c. on earth. For <hi>Calvin,</hi> is known to have made uſe of the ſecular authority where ever he could obtain it in aid of the eſtabliſhment of his diſcipline; and ſome of his followers in the reformed <hi>French Church,</hi> as for example, Monſieur <hi>Daille</hi> ſtill further explains his meaning in this place.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>CALVIN himſelf, ſays he, honoured <hi>all</hi> Biſhops, <hi>that were not ſubjects of the Pope,</hi> and taught the pure and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere doctrines of the Apoſtles—ſuch as were the Prelates of England, <hi>Cranmer, Hooper,</hi> &amp;c. We ourſelves alſo have ever maintained, and do ſtill maintain the ſame Chriſtian communion in faith and charity with their ſucceſſors—We confeſs that the foundation of their charge is <hi>good and lawful, eſtabliſhed by the Apoſtles, according to the command of Chriſt.</hi>

               <p>The like teſtimony of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s regard to our Church, and her government by Biſhops is given by Monſieur <hi>Del' Angle</hi> miniſter of the French Church at Charenton, in a letter to the Biſhop of London, 1680.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Since the Church of England is a TRUE CHURCH of our LORD; ſince her <hi>worſhip</hi> and <hi>doctrines</hi> are PURE, and have nothing in them CONTRARY to the WORD of GOD; ſince the reformation [in England] was received together with Epiſcopacy. the eſtabliſhment of the liturgy and ceremonies—it is, without doubt, the duty of all the <hi>reformed</hi> in
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:011212_0067_0F862D700B79DDC0"/>your realm, to keep themſelves inſeparably united to the Church. And thoſe who do not this, on pretence of more ſimplicity in their ceremonies, and leſs inequality among the miniſters, do certainly commit a very great ſin.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>This was ſo much the opinion of our great and excellent CALVIN,</q> that he makes no difficulty to ſay, that if there ſhould be any ſo unreaſonable, as to refuſe the communion of <q>a Church that was <hi>pure</hi> in its worſhip and doctrine, and not ſubmit himſelf with reſpect to its government, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that it hath retained an <hi>Epiſcopacy qualified, as yours is,</hi> there would be no cenſure nor rigor of diſcipline, that ought not to be exerciſed upon them.</q>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">See this and other Teſtimonies in Stillingfleet's Unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of Separation—Bingham's Apology of the French Church, &amp;c.—For where the charge is <hi>old</hi> we have no need of new anſwers in a church that hath had ſo many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble advocates.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Here then is a very different teſtimony concerning Biſhops, Epiſcopal government, the <hi>purity</hi> of our Church doctrines, &amp;c. from what the Centinel hath given; and that from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and princes of his own party. As to what is ſaid about the ſin of Non-conformity to ſuch a Church we urge not this matter, where there is no eſtabliſhment; and would be well content if theſe our bitter adverſaries would enjoy their own principles in quiet, and leave us to do the ſame, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to tear our principles in pieces, and to deprive us of our juſt and common rights as fellow Chriſtians—but to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed—</p>
               <p>BEZA, ſome time the collegue, and afterwards the rigid ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of CALVIN, was of the ſame mind with reſpect particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to the Engliſh Biſhops.—<q>The Church of England, ſays he, after the reformation was ſupported and ſtood by the Authority of Arch-Biſhops and Biſhops, of which order ſhe had many, not only famous Martyrs, but excellent doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and paſtors; and may ſhe ever enjoy that ſingular bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God upon her<note n="†" place="bottom">Bez.

               <p>HOW little of the ſpirit of thoſe <hi>non-conformiſts,</hi> quoted in my motto, the Centinel is poſſeſſed of, need not, by this time, be obſerved to impartial readers. Far from allowing the <hi>Church</hi> of England the rank of ADMIRAL in the <hi>proteſtant fleet,</hi> he will not give her ſo much as the privilege of a <hi>cock-boat;</hi> but is for turning her adrift without any commanding officer ſhe can acknowledge; and that too in a <hi>rotten and leaky</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; her whole works being "corrupted," &amp;c.—Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and un-ſailor like man; that will not even take her in <hi>tow,</hi> but ſeems deſirous to behold her ſink before his eyes!</p>
               <p>That there is not the leaſt ſhadow of ground, either in law or reaſon, for the clamour he hath ſet up to deprive our Church in the colonies of her mode of governing and ordaining her own clergy, hath been amply ſhewn; and I am now conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heavy charge of having "corrupted and obſcured the
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:011212_0069_0F862D712B2C94F0"/>pure word of God with human inventions"—whereby he endeavours to complete his triumph over our Church, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting her as unfit to have even a being, much leſs a well-being, among reformed Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>As this charge is general, I have thought it ſufficient to give it a general anſwer, and to ſhew "that it ſtands refuted by the <hi>teſtimonies</hi> of almoſt every <hi>proteſtant</hi> denomination of men upon earth, except a few reſtleſs <hi>fanatics,</hi> in our own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try"—whether the Centinel means "corruption" in point of government, or in rites, ceremonies and doctrine.</p>

               <p>PETER DU MOULIN, an eminent profeſſor in the French Church, thus expreſſes himſelf—<q>Touching eccleſiaſtical polity, we do not refuſe to acknowledge thoſe for <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>true</hi> Churches, where equality of miniſters is not obſerved—<hi>Peter Martyr, Calvin, Beza, Zanchius,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>Monſieur CLAUDE, another learned foreigner, writing to the biſhop of London, candidly declares—<q>We are ſo very far from believing that a man cannot live with a good conſcience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your diſcipline, and <hi>epiſcopal government,</hi> that in our ordinary practice we make no difficulty, neither to beſtow our chairs nor to commit the care of our flocks to miniſters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and ordained by my Lords the <hi>biſhops,</hi> as might be juſtified by a great number of examples, both old and new.—</q>

I hope then you will make all the world ſee, and convince the moſt incredulous, that you (the biſhops) have piety, zeal, and the fear of God, and that you are worthy labourers and ſervants of JESUS CHRIST. <hi>This is the teſtimony which all good men do already give you; and none, how</hi> SPIGHTFUL <hi>ſoever he be, dares to contradict it.</hi>" [<hi>N.

And certain it is, that they would moſt willingly have embraced Biſhops as their governors, if they had not been hindered by the policy, or rather iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of the civil powers. This we are expreſsly told by Doctor Du MOULIN, ſon of the famous PETER above-mentioned. In the preface to his father's book on the novelty of Popery.—<q>There was, ſays he, a time when ſome of their prime men, feeling the inconveniencies that follow the want of eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſubordination, moved Cardinal Richlieu to place it among them; who flatly denied to give way to it, ſaying, <hi>if you had that order you would look too like a</hi> CHURCH.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Nay Peter Martyr (Epiſt. 57 ad Bez.) and alſo the ſame Doctor Du MOULIN, tells us that the reformed Church in the biſhoprick of Troyes, as ſoon as the prelate began to forſake the errors of property, did <q>unanimouſly acknowledge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him as a true Biſhop and their dioceſan; and his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and piety did great ſervice to the Church of Chriſt. Praiſed be God, (continues <hi>Martyr</hi>) who takes theſe methods to govern and advance the kingdom of his ſon.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In ſhort, it was only the <hi>ſtate,</hi> and not their <hi>religious perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> that prevented the French proteſtants from having Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal government. For the aforeſaid Biſhop of <hi>Troyes,</hi> Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Caſtilion</hi> and <hi>Sangelaſius</hi> having turned proteſtants, and continued to act as Biſhops among the reformed Churches for ſome time, <q>were forced by the ſecular power to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw and betake themſelves to a private ſtation.</q>

               </p>
               <p>Were we to go back to the firſt age of the Church, we could bring a cloud of witneſſes; ſome of whom, as <hi>Clemens Romanus,</hi> who lived in the year 65, expreſsly intimates that the order of Biſhops, Prieſts, and Deacons, in the Chriſtian Church, had a reference to the orders of High-Prieſt, Prieſts, and Levites under the old oeconomy. And had this inſtitution nothing divine in it, as appearing to carry ſome reſemblance of the celeſtial hierarchy, or the orders of archangles, &amp;c. miniſtrant under <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the Church triumphant; but were merely an innocent human accommodation to the Jewiſh eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical polity, as was done in ſome other matters of rites, &amp;c. for a time, by the deciſions of the apoſtles themſelves; yet ſtill it is far more reaſonable, than to think that a perfect parity of miniſters, on the Preſbyterian model, without any diſtinction of orders, and ſo repugnant to the whole oeconomy of God's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church (which was a type of his Son's Church, and both of the Church triumphant) ſhould all at once be inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by CHRIST and his APOSTLES.</p>
               <p>Whoever will ſuppoſe this, hath invincible objections to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome, if there were not a word in ſcripture to decide the
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:011212_0071_0F862D75C2041918"/>matter. For if <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> government was inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and yet <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> as is confeſſed on all hands, was the ſole model of Church government in leſs than two hundred years after, "what univerſal cauſe can be aſſigned for this univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal apoſtacy—this ſtrange pretended alteration? Were all the Preſbyters, the whole world over, ſo very ignorant as not to know the will of Chriſt, or ſo deſperately weak and wicked, as contrary to <hi>knowledge</hi> and <hi>conſcience,</hi> to conſpire againſt themſelves,"—to reſign up to a few ambitious brethren, that authority which Chriſt had given in common to his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters? Nay, to reſign it up at once, in every place, at many thouſand miles diſtance from each other, and that quietly too, without oppoſition, without contradiction, and without the leaſt veſtige of hiſtory to record ſo marvellous a revolution? Nay, more than this, could they all agree, for the deception of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, to corrupt the very hiſtories that exiſted before, and make them declare, in direct oppoſition to the former mode of government, that Epiſcopacy, (this newly-erected, or newly-uſurped, mode) had exiſted in the Church from the beginning? Was there not one Preſbyterian, in all thoſe times, to oppoſe this uſurpation, to tranſmit his teſtimony to others, or to ſave one ancient record from the univerſal innovation?</p>
               <p>Surely ſuch another change as this was never known among mankind and <hi>Preſbyterians,</hi> in thoſe ancient times, muſt have been very different from thoſe of the preſent day, if they had thus tamely ſuffered it. We cannot now even make known our deſire to have epiſcopal government in epiſcopal Churches (a thing no way injurious to others) without whole volumes of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ſome of which may chance to reach poſterity. Could a Preſbyter of ours, now, or a Preſbyter of our antagoniſts, uſurp the whole government and right of ordination over them and us, through this whole continent, and no oppoſition be made; no record remain of the change, or no hiſtory be left to tell it to poſterity? Yet all theſe invincible difficulties, and more, are implied in ſuppoſing <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> to have inſtituted a parity of miniſters, and the Preſbyterian model, at the beginning; and that this model was ſoon afterwards laid aſide in the aforeſaid unaccountable manner. The conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which made the great <hi>Chillingworth</hi> (from whom part of the above argument is taken) conclude his demonſtration of epiſcopacy in the following ſtrong and incomparable man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>When I ſhall ſee therefore all the fables in the metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis acted, &amp;c.—when I ſhall ſee all the Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Ariſtocracies in the world lie down and ſleep, and
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:011212_0071_0F862D75C2041918"/>awake into monarchies; then will I begin to believe that Preſbyterian government, having continued in the Church during the Apoſtles' time, ſhould preſently after (againſt the Apoſtle's doctrines and the will of Chriſt) be whirled about like a ſcene in a maſque, and transformed into Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy,</q> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>But the truth is, that Preſbyterian government can boaſt no ſuch antiquity; for our <hi>great grand fathers</hi> remembered its birth, and could count its pedigree from a leſs honourable ſtock!</p>

               <p>IN my firſt number, it was obſerved that the opponents of the Church have nothing to do with that mode of government and diſcipline which Epiſcopalians chooſe for themſelves in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, unleſs ſome probability could be ſhewn (which hath never yet been done) of its interfering with the rights of others; and that, whether of divine or human original, it is enough for us to anſwer, that it is ſuch a government as we prefer; pay, ſuch as many wiſe men ever have, and probably ever will, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the modern government of Preſbytery, which (agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the words of Chillingworth in my laſt) one can no more believe to have been in uſe "during the Apoſtles' times and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently afterwards (contrary to their doctrine and the will of Chriſt) to have been whirled about like a ſcene in a maſque, and transformed into Epiſcopacy; then it can be thought poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for all the Democracies and Ariſtocracies in the world to lie down and ſleep, and to awake into monarchies, without op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition or trace of hiſtory to record the marvellous change."</p>
               <p>It was therefore not ſo much from any neceſſity, in my argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the Centinel (becauſe right or wrong, it was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient that Epiſcopacy was our mode) as to prevent ſerious E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopalians from being impoſed upon by his bold and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs aſſertion; that I have taken ſome pains to ſhew that ſuch an Epiſcopate as is propoſed for America, far from being a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel invention, is what almoſt all the reformed Churches have
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:011212_0072_0F862D7864FE98A8"/>given their teſtimony for; declared it to be a truly ancient and even apoſtolical inſtitution; and ſuch as they would willingly have been ſubject to, if they had not been prevented by the ſituation of affairs, under different ſtates, at the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
               <p>On this footing, then, I leave this matter of Epiſcopacy, and proceed to inquire whether we are juſtly chargeable with any corruption, in having preſerved ſuch rites and ceremonies in our Church, as were judged by our wiſe reformers to be for decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and good order, harmleſs in their own nature, and neither contradictory to the general uſage of proteſtants, nor to any poſitive law in ſcripture?</p>
               <p>The great principles upon which the Church of England was purged from the droſs of popery, are fully ſet forth in her articles, the prefaces to her liturgy, and by many of her able ſons; and they do honour to the ſpirit and temper of our firſt reformers.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Thoſe men (ſaith the learned Biſhop Sanderſon) are much miſtaken, who either meaſure the proteſtant religion by an oppoſition to popery; or account all popery, that is taught or practiſed by the Church of Rome. It is only the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſuperſtition of that Church, whereunto the name of popery doth belong. Our godly forefathers had no purpoſe (nor had they any warrant) to ſet up a new reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, but to reform the old, by purging it from innovations, which, in tract of time (ſome ſooner, ſome later) had mingled with it and corrupted it, both in doctrine and worſhip. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this purpoſe, they proceeded, without conſtraint or precipitancy, freely and adviſedly, as in peaceable times; and brought their intentions to a happy end. All thoſe doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines which are either contrary to the written word of God, or ſuperadded thereto as neceſſary points of faith; all thoſe ſuperſtitions which are either unlawful, as contrary to God's word; or being not contrary, and therefore indifferent, are made eſſentials, and impoſed as neceſſary parts of worſhip—theſe are things whereunto the name of popery doth properly belong;</q> and were accordingly rejected by our Church at the reformation. <q>As to ceremonies, the Church meant to make uſe of her liberty, and the lawful power ſhe had (and all Churches of Chriſt have, or ought to have) of ordering her eccleſiaſtical affairs, yet to do it with ſo much prudence and moderation, that the world might ſee, by what was laid aſide, that ſhe acknowledged no ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the ſee of Rome; and by what was retained, that ſhe did not recede from the Church of Rome out of any ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:011212_0072_0F862D7864FE98A8"/>of contradiction, but as neceſſitated for the maintenance of her juſt liberty.</q>—In ſhort, <q>as it is well expreſſed by a humourous writer, in ſtripping off the lace, ſhe was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to tear the garment.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning rites and ceremonies, we have the confeſſion of all the reformed Churches, except perhaps our Centinel's Church, that they are not unlawful in themſelves, where they are decent and ſignificant.</p>

               <p>The Bohemian is—"that ceremonies brought in, by a good cuſtom, are with an uniform conſent to be retained in the eccleſiaſtical aſſemblies of Chriſtian people, in the common ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God."<note n="†" place="bottom">

               <p>Such are the conceſſions, and ſuch the practice of the moſt conſiderable reformed Churches abroad, with reſpect to ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in general—which are probably accounted among thoſe "human inventions" wherewith our Church is accuſed by the Centinel of having "corrupted the pure word of God." If he will mention any particulars that are exceptionable in our Church, which are not retained in other proteſtant Churches, we ſhall ſhew that we are either able to defend them, or wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give them up. And till he does this, our anſwer can only be general. Let us now hear the ſentiments of ſome of the ableſt foreign divines on the ſame ſubject. Calvin, as uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, I chooſe to lead the van; who has a long and excellent
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:011212_0073_0F862D79B8E78140"/>diſcourſe<note place="bottom">†† <hi>Inſtit. Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>C.</hi> 10.</note> on Rites and Ceremonies; out of which it will be ſufficient to ſelect only a few paſſages.</p>
               <p>"All churches, ſays he, have power to make laws and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances for eſtabliſhing a common polity among themſelves—but no polity can be upheld but by certain laws, nor any Rites obſerved, without a ſtated Form. Therefore, we are ſo far from condemning the laws which conduce to this end, that we ſay, to take them away, is to cut the ſinews of the church, and render it both weak and deformed.—The end of decency is, partly that, by appointing ſuch Rites as will create a reverence for holy things, we may by ſuch helps, be excited to devotion, and partly that our modeſty and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, which are commendable in all our actions, may there more eſpecially appear."</p>
               <p>Nor does he conſider Church laws, about decent Rites and Ceremonies, as mere human inventions.—For "ſuch laws ſays he, are founded on the authority of Scripture, and ſo are both human and divine: which he illuſtrates by the Geneva law, for kneeling at public prayer, as follows,—"If it be aſked, continues he, whether this be an human tradition, which any man may refuſe or neglect at pleaſure? I anſwer, it is ſo human, as alſo to be divine. It is of God, as it is part of that decency commended by the Apoſtle (1 Cor. xiv. 40.) But it is of men, as it particularly ſpecifies, what the Scripture on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared in general.—By this one example we may make an eſtimate of all things of this kind. In outward diſcipline and ceremonies, Chriſt did not particularly preſcribe what we ſhould do; becauſe he foreſaw that would depend upon the different condition of times; and he did not judge one form agreeable to all ages.—"And elſewhere,<note place="bottom">‡‡ <hi>De Reform. Eccleſ. C.</hi> 16.</note> he ſays, I do not contend about Ceremonies, that ſerve only for Decency and Order; nor yet againſt ſuch as are ſymbols of, or incitements to, that reverence we owe to God."—Now that ſuch is the intention of our church ceremonies, ſhe expreſsly declares; and that they are not meant to bind conſcience, but for decen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and order.</p>
               <p>But to proceed with Calvin, neither he nor his followers had any more objection to forms of prayer than to decent rites, &amp;c. In his letter to the Protector of England, he ſays, As to what concerns a form of prayer and eccleſiaſtical rites, I highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it; that there be a certain <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ary."—So the canon<note n="†" place="bottom">Book of Diſcip. C. 5.</note> of the
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:011212_0073_0F862D79B8E78140"/>French Church expreſsly determined; and Calvin not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his own opinion in theſe things, but preſſed ſtrongly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others to have all diſputes done away concerning them—"I hope ſays he, to the fiery John Knox, your rigour about ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, which is diſpleaſing to many, will keep itſelf within due bounds of moderation."—<note n="†" place="bottom">Epiſt. ad Joh. Knox.</note> To Farel, he alſo thus writes—"Uſe your endeavour that the brethren do not pertinaciouſly contend about ceremonies.

               <p>Happy had it been, if the Centinel and his party could have followed this advice; and as they are, or may be free from any thing that they may think corrupted, or of human invention in our Church, that they would enjoy the liberty which God hath given, and ſuffer us to do the ſame!</p>

               <p>I could add the teſtimonies of Martyr, Claude, L'Angle, Turretine, Le Moyne, &amp;c. abroad; and even of Baxter, Ball, and many more at home; but ſome notice will be taken of them, when I come in my next number to ſpeak of the purity of our church doctrine. On the preſent head of ceremonies and rites, I would not wiſh to be tedious. For ſome of thoſe things, which were once ſo offenſive to ſome among ourſelves, are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming every day leſs ſo; and never gave any offence to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign churches; ſuch as the obſervation of holy-days, Church-muſic, the gown, the Surplice, the Square-cap, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>As to gowns and collegiate habits, Calvin was ſo ſtrict that he would have expelled ſome ſtudents if they had not complied with his rules, and he once maintained a good ſcolding-match with a zealous female ſaint concerning his own long garment; but is is ſaid the female had the laſt word of him, and ſtill hold to her point, viz. that thoſe long garments were the ſcripture marks of falſe prophets, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>AS the Centinel, in his groſs charge againſt our Church, of having "corrupted the pure word of God with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man inventions," did neither think proper to mention what thoſe <hi>inventions</hi> are, nor in what points they are to be found, viz.—whether in <hi>government,</hi> in <hi>rites and ceremonies,</hi> or in <hi>doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines;</hi> I thought it neceſſary, in order to be ſure of his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to ſuppoſe the whole <hi>three;</hi> and, in each of them, to make one <hi>appeal,</hi> as well to the judgment of reformed Churches abroad, as of ſuch particular divines both at home and abroad, as might probably have the moſt weight with the Centinel and his party.</p>
               <p>What relates to the two firſt points, (viz. epiſcopal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, rites and ceremonies) being already diſcuſſed, little need be ſaid on the laſt point, viz. the <hi>doctrines</hi> of our Church. Theſe, as contained in our articles, have long had the teſtimony of the whole proteſtant world, in favour of their <hi>purity</hi> and <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxy;</hi> and unleſs the Centinel ſhould declare ſo, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and expreſs terms, I can hardly imagine that he meant to run ſo contrary to the ſentiments of his own party (even ſome of the moſt rigid of them at home) as to charge any corruption upon the <hi>doctrinal parts</hi> of our <hi>articles,</hi> or <hi>Church ſervice.</hi> However, as his meaning is ſo vague and undetermined, it may not be improper to add a few teſtimonies on this head, as I have done on the former; although the ſubject be ſomewhat antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, in the teſtimonies already given; where the writers had not ſeparated one part from the other, but had ſpoken of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Which, that the whole world is but your dioceſe; that all Biſhops re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of your fullneſs; that all power is given to you in heaven and earth; that you are not ſubject to the judgment of Kings, nor of the whole clergy, nor of the whole world? which of them ſo nicely and mathematically aſcribed juſt ſeventy-ſeven degrees of power and authority to you, more than to the greateſt Prince upon earth? Which of the fathers ever defined you not to be mere men, but a certain ſubſtance made up of God and man? Which of them ſays, you have the command over purgatory and the angels of God, &amp;c.?"—Which of them taught you to ſay private maſs, while the people looked on, or to hold the ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over your head, wherein the whole of your religion at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conſiſts; or to mangle Chriſt's ſacraments, and contrary to his inſtitution and expreſs words, to defraud the people of one part of them?"—</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>"If we are ſciſmaticks for diſſenting from this, what name ſhall we give them, who have fallen from the primitive Church, from Chriſt himſelf and his apoſtles?—We ſet forth the holy ſcriptures in all languages; they will not ſuffer them to be publiſhed in any one. We invite the people to hear and read the word of God; they do all they can to keep them from it. We endeavour to make our caſe known to the whole world; they will come to no trial. We depend on learning; they on ignorance. We truſt to light; they to darkneſs. We pay due reſpect to the writings of the apoſtles and prophets; they commit them to the flames, we deſire to have the cauſe of God tried by God</hi> only: they will appeal to none but themſelves. Therefore, when we ſaw all things thus trodden underfoot, and propoſed to reſtore the <hi>temple of God</hi> to its primitive beauty, we deſired no other foundation than that which we knew the apoſtles had laid of old; that is, our <hi>Saviour JESUS CHRIST.—</hi> As to their brags of the <hi>Pope</hi>'s being <hi>Peter</hi>'s ſucceſſor—and unable to err, &amp;c. it is all a jeſt. God hath promiſed his grace to a pious mind; not to <hi>ſees</hi> and <hi>ſucceſſions.—</hi> Wherein was <hi>Peter</hi> ever like the <hi>Pope,</hi> or the <hi>Pope</hi> like <hi>Peter?</hi> unleſs perhaps they will ſay, that Peter took away his keys of the kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and hid his Lord's talent; or that he only ſat in ſtate, in his palace of <hi>St. John Lateran,</hi> and pointed out all the places of <hi>Purgatory,</hi> and the ſeveral kinds of puniſhment, commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſome poor ſouls to be tormented, and releaſing others, as he is paid for it; exempting himſelf from civil power; making war himſelf, and the occaſion of war among other Princes; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about on the ſhoulders of noblemen in a golden chair, &amp;c. &amp;c.—Or will they rather ſay, the Pope now does what we knew Peter did? viz. that he is inſtant <hi>in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon;</hi> fulfils the <hi>miniſtry of Chriſt;</hi> is the <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the houſe of Iſrael;</hi> receives the oracles of God, and delivers them to the people as he received them; is the <hi>ſalt of the earth and Light of the world; feeds</hi> not himſelf but his flock; is not <hi>Lord over God's heritage;</hi> is ſubject unto Princes, &amp;c. &amp;c.?"—</p>
                     <p>"But theſe tricks have (as the bird of the night, at the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the ſun) vaniſhed at the appearance of the goſpel.—It was the will and pleaſure of almighty God, that, in ſpite of all its enemies, the Goſpel of Jeſus ſhould at this time be ſpread over the face of the whole earth; and men, obeying the commands of God, have, of their own accord, betaken them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt. We, in good truth, expected neither riches, pleaſure, nor eaſe from this ſeparation; for all thoſe our enemies abound with; and we enjoyed a much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhare of them when we agreed with them. Neither do we ſhun <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>concord;</hi> but we will not fight againſt God, to be at peace with men."—</p>
                  </note> by which a judgment may be made of the principles of our Church, and what a bulwark of the reformation ſhe is to be eſteemed.</p>
               <p>And is there then, no regard, no charity due among fellow proteſtants to a Church that has borne ſuch a part in vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating our glorious common cauſe, and ſetting at nought the
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:011212_0077_0F862D7DD18AFF50"/>aſſaults of our common enemy? Is ſhe ſtill to be called <hi>Corrupt, Superſtitious,</hi> nay <hi>poſſibly</hi> affected, after ſo many well fought bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles againſt the CORRUPTIONS and SUPERSTITIONS of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom?

<pb n="146" facs="unknown:011212_0078_0F862D7F22EFE4B8"/>of apoſtolical inſtitution; becauſe they were once mixt with the corruptions of Rome? This may pleaſe ſuch reformers as our Centinel and his party; but thanks be to God, we have not ſo learned Chriſt!</p>
               <p>Having thus, I hope, with due temper, anſwered the Centi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel on the principal heads propoſed; I ſhall conclude theſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in <hi>Three</hi> more numbers, unleſs freſh provocation be given.

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>SO abhorent to my nature is every ſpecies of recrimination, however juſtly provoked, that it is with ſome reluctance I enter upon the remainder of the taſk I propoſed for myſelf. The very <hi>cur</hi> that ſnarls at me, I am loth to treat with oppro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious names, and would rather quiet him by throwing a cruſt, than attempting to break his bones.</p>
               <p>Though you and your friends have called my <hi>knife</hi> a bloody one, and have ſometimes in imagination magnified it into a <hi>cleaver;</hi> yet let the public judge between you and me, whether I have not gone about my work with a decent and merciful hand, neither mangling the fleſh, nor disjointing the bones; but carefully ſeparating the one from the other, I have fully ſhewn that the fears and jealouſies you have endeavoured to ſpread among his Majeſty's good ſubjects in America, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eccleſiaſtical courts, the loſs of ſpiritual liberty, and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:011212_0078_0F862D7F22EFE4B8"/>epiſcopal juriſdictions to be erected over the <hi>laity,</hi> are abſolute chimeras of your own brain, without the leaſt ſhadow of ground, in any law (<hi>ſtatute</hi> or <hi>common</hi>) that hath force in theſe colonies. I have ſhown further that your un-chriſtian and un-brotherly charge againſt our Church, of having <hi>corrupted the pure word of God with human inventions,</hi> ſtands refuted by the teſtimonies of almoſt every <hi>reformed</hi> Church upon earth; even by the founders and princes of your own party.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, I have left the reader to judge, whether in your behaviour towards your epiſcopal brethren, you could have been actuated by any better motive than an <hi>unhallowed zeal</hi> to exalt your own party on the depreſſion of others; and whether it be fair or candid to keep up an eternal clamour, in order to deprive your fellow-proteſtants of a juſt and natural right, merely on account of groundleſs jealouſies, about contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies abſolutely <hi>improbable,</hi> and only <hi>poſſible</hi> upon a ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that all our laws and charters are to be diſſolved. I have appealed to your own conſcience, whether <hi>union</hi> among our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in America, or the common cauſe of <hi>proteſtantiſm,</hi> are likely to be promoted by vilifying and traducing a Church which, I will ſtill ſay, is the main bulwark of the reformation; whoſe venerable martyrs ſealed it with their blood; and whoſe illuſtrious divines, ſtill foremoſt in the battle, have ſhook the <hi>papacy</hi> to its loweſt foundation, and have exhibitted to the world ſuch noble writings in favour of primitive Chriſtianity, as we believe, will only periſh, or ceaſe to be admired, when the world itſelf ſhall periſh with them!</p>
               <p>So far, I think Sir, I ought not even to incur your blame in having proceeded; and although I was not forward to enter into this diſpute, yet rejoiced I am in the event, that it hath furniſhed an anſwer, and given ſatisfaction, to ſome thouſands, whom your party, in every corner of the country, were endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to prejudice in their ſentiments concerning our Church. But, although I have thus far touched you but lightly, yet in what remains I muſt approach towards your very <hi>vitals;</hi> and therefore I am unwilling to proceed without giving you a ſhort <hi>reſpite,</hi> to ſee if you have any thing further to offer for your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and whether I may not be ſaved from ſome part of the diſagreeable taſk that lies before me. In the mean while, I will fairly tell you my <hi>three</hi> remaining ſubjects, which will be more or leſs enlarged upon, according as you offer freſh matter; for I am earneſtly deſirous, on account of the public, that this controverſy, if it muſt be further proſecuted, ſhould be brought to as ſpeedy an iſſue as poſſible.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You and your friends, allying yourſelves with the <hi>North-Briton,</hi>
                  <pb n="148" facs="unknown:011212_0079_0F862D7F61C8F8B8"/>have aſſiduouſly circulated his number LXI. with this favourite doctrine to exalt your party—"No DISSENTER, NO LIBERTY."—I propoſe therefore to give ſome ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens of the zeal ſhewn by your party for <hi>liberty</hi> from the beginning.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The <hi>Remonſtrant,</hi> one of your auxiliaries, if peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture not yourſelf, hath told us how many have ſuffered under the penal laws of our Church, and threatens us with hanging theſe laws out to view. Juſt as if one were to throw a parcel of dead men's bodies before our eyes, and accuſe a certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as the murderer, threatning, if he would not confeſs the fact, to produce the weapon wherewith it was perpetrated. We would be glad this weapon was produced, as we think it an alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating circumſtance that it would be found a <hi>defenſive,</hi> not an <hi>offenſive</hi> one. Upon this head therefore, I propoſe to ſhew what have been the doctrines of your party concerning that <hi>toloration</hi> whereof you boaſt yourſelves to be examples; and ſhall make good what Biſhop BRAMHAL long ſince ſaid to your fore-runner <hi>Baxter.</hi>—"Sum up all of your party that ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Reformation have been <hi>caſt aſide,</hi> or <hi>driven away</hi> in the whole kingdom; and we will ſet in the balance only thoſe who, in the ſhort ſpace of ſeven years, in three places, London and the two Univerſities, were haled to priſons, chaſed into Baniſhments, ſequeſtered, or left to the mercileſs world to beg their bread, and they ſhall double your number;— and for learning, &amp;c. thoſe of your party will ſcarce deſerve to be named with them in the ſame day; and if we compare the ſufferings of your ſuppoſed confeſſors, they will appear but <hi>flea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitings,</hi> in compariſon of theirs. But the greateſt diſparity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth yet untouched.—the one ſuffered for FAITH and LOYALTY, &amp;c.—the others for FACTION.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As to my concluding paper, this I propoſe for the ſubject. You have moſt unjuſtly accuſed a ſociety, conſiſting of many of the moſt reſpectable names in Great-Britain "of having ſquandered away money collected for the relief of the ſavages." I will therefore enquire what uſe your party has made of large ſums collected for the ſame purpoſe. Further, you are again in your 21ſt. number labouring to prove Doctor <hi>Chandler</hi> the aggreſſor in this diſpute; although if he had begun it, there is a manifeſt difference between a pamphlet, read probably by a hundred people, and introducing the matter, as you did, into a news-paper, to be read perhaps by thirty thouſand. But to cut this matter ſhort, I am able to lay before the world ſome letters written by the leaders of your party, in November 1766 (long before Dr. Chandler wrote his piece) wherein this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:011212_0079_0F862D7F61C8F8B8"/>upon the Church in America, (purſuant to letters from England) was projected; and a confeſſion made that your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were <q>determined in a few months to be at as great vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with <hi>Churchmen</hi> on account of their deſire of Biſhops, as ever you were with the <hi>Quakers;</hi> and that, for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, <hi>ſalutary ſteps</hi> were then taking to get the WHOLE PRES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BYTERIAN INTEREST on the <hi>Continent,</hi> more firmly united.</q> I can even oblige you with your plan of union, correſpondence, committees, &amp;c. and even the names of ſome committees, If I had not too good an opinion of ſeveral whoſe names you have made free with, to believe they were ever conſulted or conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſuch a ſcheme. To this, if I had not a deſire to cloſe rather than widen differences, could be added, a ſample of ſome exhortations, circulated not a year ago <q>to ſcour rifles, thraſh grain, make double diligence in their <hi>ſtills,</hi> and to fly in the face of government;</q> which it would make one ſhudder to read. From all which I muſt conclude with an argument in your way, and ſhew that if we are to regard preſent appearances, or form any judgment of the future, from what is paſt, it is at the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious ſpirit and growing power of your party, and not at the government of our Church by a Biſhop, that all America ought juſtly to be alarmed.</p>
               <p>But, in truth, from the gloomy proſpect that ſeems gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt us on the other ſide of the <hi>Atlantic;</hi> it might be better for you, and for me, to cultivate <hi>domeſtic harmony</hi> for the preſent, and ſuſpend the ſettlement of our remaining differences to a more convenient ſeaſon; all which will depend intirely on yourſelf and your party.</p>

               <p>THO' I verily believe the Church of England to be both in Form and Doctrine, the moſt pure and acceptable to God, of any religious Society now exiſting upon the Face of the Earth, and conſequently it muſt be my earneſt Wiſh and Deſire that this Church which I ſo highly eſteem and reverence, may ſpread and prevail uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally; yet the long continued reiterated Clamours of the <hi>American Whig,</hi> the <hi>Centinel</hi> and other Writers againſt the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Biſhops to reſide in the Britiſh Colonies, as if there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by both our religious and civil Liberties would be not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered but abſolutely loſt, could not fail to awaken in me ſome uneaſy Apprehenſions of the Conſequences that might at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the eſtabliſhment of thoſe reverend Prelates among us. The Writers againſt them had made uſe of every Art and Argument, to repreſent theſe Conſequences in the moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Light, and I could not help being a little alarmed; for tho' their Arguments were very far from convincing, yet they puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled me: I ſuppoſed them to be wrong, but was not without ſome Anxiety at the Thought that they might poſſibly be right. I would have ſet myſelf down to examine their Arguments cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically for myſelf, but my Situation would not admit of it, and my Opinion remained vibrating in Suſpenſe, till I fortunately met with the foregoing Pages of the Anatomiſt, which have placed all the material Points in a clear Light, and removed all
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:011212_0080_0F862D8256CD6ED0"/>the Difficulties that perplexed me: And as you ſeem to be in much the ſame Predicament that I was, I ſend you the ſame Medicine that relieved me, for which I doubt not, you will be, as I was, ſincerely thankful to the judicious Author.</p>
               <p>I obſerve one of the points which both the <hi>Whig</hi> and the <hi>Centinel,</hi> very much labour to prove, is, that no particular Church, or religious Society, more than others, ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a civil eſtabliſhment in any Government—By the Way, I believe there is no religious Sect in the Britiſh Dominions, but what have avail'd themſelves of a Civil Eſtabliſhment, when e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they have had Opportunity, as much as the Church—for Inſtance—The religious Forms and Principles in the New-England Governments, are ſo interwoven with the Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Civil Government, that a Man ſtands very little Chance of being prefer'd to Offices of Honour and Importance—un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs his religious Profeſſion and Conduct correſponds with the general Eſtabliſhment of thoſe Colonies—there are indeed ſome Exceptions to this general Obſervation, but Inſtances are rare: And I believe it is an indiſputable Fact, that this Aid and Support of the civil Power, with the Hopes and Expectations, it gives riſe to, are the principal Means of continuing the Modes and Doctrines that have long prevail'd in thoſe Governments. —But to return.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the ſpecious Arguments of the <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Centinel,</hi> it ſeem'd to me an Abſurdity, that a Church con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly form'd and inſtituted by Chriſt himſelf (for that the Argument ſuppoſes) ſhould be prohibitted from receiving the Aid and Countenance of the Civil Power, or at leaſt any Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to other religious Societies.—This Argument I take to be indefenſible, unleſs upon the Suppoſition that there can be no ſtronger Evidence in favour of Truth than of Falſhood. Add to this, that the <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Centinel</hi> in their Manner of arguing, manifeſted a Diſpoſition very unſuitable to the Spirit of that Religion they pretended to be ſo zealous to promote, and laid them under ſtrong Suſpicions, of acting upon falſe Principles, with unworthy Deſigns. Inſtead of ſtating Facts in a clear Light, and arguing upon them in a candid reaſonable Manner, their Aim appears to have been to miſrepreſent, and place every matter of Diſpute in the moſt obſcure and unfavourable Point of View,—To perplex an Argument, and evade the Point in Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; to put the worſt and moſt perverſe Conſtruction upon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Expreſſion, and to uſe a Style and Language full of Haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs, Inſolence and Provocation, calculated not to convince and reconcile, but to irritate and inflame, to widen and perpetuate Differences from one Generation to another. Theſe Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:011212_0081_0F862D8262E50F48"/>upon the Writings of the <hi>Whig, Centinel,</hi> &amp;c. being ſuch as could not fail to ſtrike a Reader of the leaſt Attention, gave me a ſhrewd Suſpicion that every Thing they had advanced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Biſhops and the Church, was founded on Deceit and Malice, intended to do Miſchief, to root out and deſtroy, or hinder the Growth of the Church in America, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting its Enjoyment of an undoubted Right eſſential to its Support and Continuance. But theſe were rather Matters of Suppoſition than abſolute Certainty to me, till I had the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to find the Subject fully inveſtigated by the <hi>Anatomiſt,</hi> who has removed my Doubts, and given me entire Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
               <p>The American Profeſſors of the Religion of the Church eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in England, the moſt pure and reſpectable Church upon Earth, have an undoubted Right, at leaſt, in common with other religious Societies, to occupy and poſſeſs within themſelves all the Powers and Offices neceſſary to the Completion and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of their own Body as a Church. But thoſe Rights, the <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Centinel,</hi> and their Party have thought proper to withhold from them, under Pretence, that they might poſſibly uſe them to the Oppreſſion of other religious Denominations; and ſo theſe good Gentlemen would actually do a certain Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Church, on an Imagination that the Church might poſſibly hereafter do the ſame Injury to them! I wonder how they would like to have this Doctrine practiſed upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?</p>
               <p>I am at a Loſs to determine whether the Clamours and Diſputes of theſe Gentlemen upon this Head are moſt remarkable, as being ridiculous or malevolent.</p>
               <p>This however I am ſure of, that if their writings ſhould at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract any conſiderable Notice in England, and ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be agreeable to the general Sentiments of the Colonies (as the Writers themſelves, all along, with great Injuſtice, endeavour to make the World believe) or even of a conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Number in them, ſuch a Belief in England, would raiſe the moſt fatal Prejudice againſt the Colonies, and be the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of inconceivable Miſchiefs: We ſhould be all conſidered as a factious, turbulent, unreaſonable People, implacable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the Church; and conſequently all the Friends to the Church, who are the moſt powerful Body of the Nation, would be againſt us; but I hope, thro' the Interpoſition of divine Providence, the Evil may be averted, or fall only on thoſe who deviſed it.</p>

                  <hi>Remainder of a brief View of Eccleſiaſtical Juriſdiction, as it is at this Day practiſed in</hi> England: <hi>Begun in</hi> No. XXVI. Vol. I. page 422.</head>
               <p>I Have now by me a moſt moving and lamentable account (contained in above ſixty letters) ſent me by Mr. <hi>John Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt of Old Durham,</hi> (formerly a member of your houſe) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining of the moſt barbarous and tyrannic proceedings of the ſpiritual and temporal courts there, againſt his perſon, eſtate, and property, that ever was known to have been practiſed in any court of law or juſtice whatever. And this (as he ſays) chiefly promoted and carried on by a confederacy between the biſhop's chancellor and ſheriff, who, by their under-officers and agents, have illegally ſeized upon whatever of his property they can lay their hands on, on pretence of an outlawry or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, of which he had no notice till the ſeizure actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally made.—And that, upon application to his ſovereign, the biſhop, for redreſs, he has been denied all manner of relief; and therefore intreats me to repreſent his caſe to you, the parliament's committee, which I am now preparing to that end.</p>
               <p>But before I trouble you with that particular caſe, I beg leave to add a few other general obſervations, touching the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices and practices of biſhops, &amp;c. in driving on their eccleſiaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical trade of getting money. Which artifices and practices, I ſhall endeavour to range under theſe ten general heads, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of ſome excentricities) viz.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By their fees for ordaining prieſts and deacons, which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ordinations being at four times in the year, may well be computed at about 100<abbr>l.</abbr> each time. And thus the whole 26 biſhops and archbiſhops, may make in the whole about 10,400<abbr>l.</abbr> per annum.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By inſtitutions and inductions to vacant benefices, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:011212_0082_0F862D8331E1CE50"/>one of which they have at leaſt three pounds. And there being computed in England 9285 pariſhes, this, at the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rate of one in a pariſh, comes to 27,855<abbr>l.</abbr>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> Some pariſhes conſiſt of divers benefices, and others, have divers chapelries, which are of the ſame nature, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire inſtitution and induction as well as other benefices.— The ſingle pariſh of Halifax in Yorkſhire, has ten or twelve ſuch chapelries. Nor are the inſtitutions to archdeaconries, deanries, prebendaries, ſinecures, &amp;c. here included; ſo that this head of inſtitutions and inductions, is of much greater be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to biſhops than is generally eſtimated.</p>
               <p n="3">3. For making rural deans, and for taking their oaths, &amp;c. The biſhops uſually received of every rural dean ſo ſworn, the yearly ſum of 8<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr> as I am informed. And this may hint to us the reaſon why the late Queen Anne, no doubt on the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or importunity of ſome biſhops, ſent her letter, dated 29 Jan. 1710, to the then convocation, for augmenting the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of rural deans, &amp;c. See <hi>Nelſon's rights of the clergy,</hi> 252.</p>
               <p n="4">4. By granting viſitation licences to beneficed miniſters to preach in their own cures; for although they are ordained, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, and inducted before, and by the canons are ſtrictly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined to preach the goſpel; yet this muſt not be done, till ſuch a viſitation licence, or the biſhop's approbation, be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Which licence, on every epiſcopal viſitation, coſts every ſuch beneficed miniſter 10<abbr>s.</abbr> And this for the ſaid 9285 pariſhes, or rather above 10,000 benefices in England, comes to 5000<abbr>l.</abbr> per annum.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> when the biſhop does not viſit, the archdeacon does, and that twice yearly; ſo that there never fails a viſitation, in order to pick up the pence. <hi>Vide Poſt.</hi> Archdeacon's juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By granting ſeveral other ſpecial kinds of licences, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of nine or ten are ſufficiently remarkable, viz.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Licences to unbeneficed curates and deacons to preach, &amp;c.</item>
                  <item>2. Licences to ſchoolmaſters and ſchoolmiſtreſſes to teach, &amp;c.</item>
                  <item>3. Licences to pariſh-clerks to ſing, &amp;c.</item>
                  <item>4. Licences to pariſhioners to repair, enlarge, or amend their church.</item>
                  <item>5. Licences to church-wardens and overſeers in divers caſes.</item>
                  <item>6. Licences to phyſicians to practiſe phyſic.</item>
                  <item>7. Licences to midwives to practiſe their profeſſion, and to baptize.</item>
                  <item>8. Licences to notaries public to practiſe knavery.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="155" facs="unknown:011212_0082_0F862D8331E1CE50"/>9. Licences to marry, and commit adultery, to have two wives, &amp;c.</item>
               </list>
               <p>And I believe, on enquiry, ſome other kinds of biſhop's licences may be diſcovered, as perhaps licences to <hi>communicate with</hi> the church of Rome; for I have heard ſome diſcourſes of that kind.</p>
               <p>But to proceed,</p>
               <p n="6">6. The biſhops alſo receive very conſiderable profits or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites by conſecrating of churches and churchyards; for tho' nothing be due of right, yet 'tis well known what is volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily given into the hands of a biſhop's ſervant for his maſter's uſe, can be no ſimony or corruption in the biſhop. This may be learned from the example of a preſent right reverend and ever memorable prelate.</p>
               <p n="7">7. By granting abſolutions and commutations for penances, wherein there is generally a regard had to the ability of the ſinner.—For if he be rich, a good round ſum is expected to free him from that chain of the Devil, called excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but if the wretch be poor, he is delivered to the Devil of courſe; and though he performs his penance both in body and ſoul, yet neither can be delivered either from Hell or the eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical court, 'till he has paid his fees.</p>
               <p n="8">8. They alſo receive vaſt ſums of money by granting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates of wills, and letters of adminiſtration.—And by an uſurped right (for ſo, in fact, this juriſdiction is) they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come in a great meaſure the diſpoſers and diſpenſers of dead men's will's; and though now therein providentially reſtrained in ſome things, by the act of diſtributions, yet ſtill poſſeſſed of too much power to be for the ſubject's benefit.</p>
               <p n="9">9. By framing new oaths and articles againſt their viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and compelling church-wardens to ſwear to preſent accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch new invented articles; whereby divers proſecutions of innocent perſons have been carried on in the eccleſiaſtical courts.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, this practice is now almoſt <hi>ex uſu,</hi> but inſtead thereof we have almoſt yearly new ſets of paſtoral charges, which, how little benefit ſoever they bring either to the flock or to the bookſeller, yet have proved gainful to ſome of their Lordſhips.</p>
               <p n="10">10. By procurations, ſynodals, and other viſitatorial pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and penſions: For in the biſhop's viſitation two things are obſervable:</p>
               <p n="1">1. The churchwardens and chapel-wardens of every pariſh and chapelry within the dioceſe, are called over, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a book of articles to preſent by, for which they generally
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:011212_0083_0F862D83E5651308"/>pay 2<abbr>s.</abbr> or 2<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr> and if any of them are abſent, they are there cited or ſummoned by proclamation, to appear in the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's next conſiſtorial cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> with coſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> Theſe church-wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ens and chapel-wardens do pay at every biſhop's viſitation for ſuch a book of articles, though the very ſame they had before. They alſo pay the biſhop's clerk for writing their preſentments, (though many of them do it themſelves) 2<abbr>s.</abbr> 6<abbr>d.</abbr> which, in 9285 pariſhes, comes to 1058<abbr>l.</abbr> to which add for the book of articles, and it doubles the ſum.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All the miniſters within the dioceſe are obliged to attend the biſhop's viſitation, where they are to pay about 1. 8<abbr>d.</abbr> or more, merely for producing to the biſhop's regiſter their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences to preach, though ſuch licences have been ſo produced and allowed never ſo often before—After which, they pay to the biſhop, or to his uſe, the uſual ſum for procuration and ſynodals; as alſo 8<abbr>d.</abbr> claimed by the gentleman apparitor, to whom moſt pays 1<abbr>s.</abbr> This payment ſeems to be in favour of the biſhop's man, in order to obtain that of the maſter. There is alſo a ſuit and ſervice expected at this court from all, even the pooreſt unbeneficed curate or clerk within the dioceſe.— But I ſuppoſe theſe are ſpared in point of money, out of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, or—.</p>
               <p>One thing more is obſervable with reſpect to the province of York, viz. That when any archbiſhop is firſt inſtalled or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throned at York, all the perſons and vicars within his juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though never ſo poor, and their family-charge never ſo great, are obliged to give him the tenth of their eccleſiaſtical livings, as a benevolence, in order to aſſiſt the poor archbiſhop to ſettle himſelf in that ſee; which they ſay uſually amounts to ſeven or eight thouſand pounds (a ſweet morſel of eccleſiaſtical food!) And 'tis ſaid, that if any, even the meaneſt vicar, whoſe children want bread, does thro' poverty omit this cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary payment, he muſt certainly expect to be ſeverely whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for the offence, in their mercileſs ſpiritual court, 'till they have flayed him to the very bones.</p>
               <p>Beſides which, in ſome dioceſes, as London, &amp;c. there is a duty paid, called the biſhop's penſion, i. e. 10<abbr>l.</abbr> for every archdeaconry, and proportionably for other dignities and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar juriſdictions, as may be ſeen in <hi>Newcourt's Repertorium Canonicum,</hi> vol. I. and II.</p>
               <p>Next to epiſcopal juriſdiction is to be conſidered that of the archdeacons, whoſe number I have before limitted to ſixty, but find on a farther ſcrutiny they may be enlarged to ſeventy, or
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:011212_0083_0F862D83E5651308"/>more; for the dioceſe of London alone has five, and other dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſes proportionable.</p>
               <p>Theſe archdeacons have their viſitations twice yearly, viz. at Michaelmas and Eaſter, both which afford them plentiful har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſts, in their collections of procurations, ſynodals, and other profitable perquiſities. For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. At their Eaſter viſitations, the miniſters within their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective diſtricts pay them ſynodals, which they denominate their paſchal rents, taking of each perſon ſix or ſeven ſhillings, ſome more, ſome leſs; for theſe payments are not all alike, but, I ſuppoſe, raiſed or leſſened according to the value of the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; but none muſt come empty-handed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. At their Michaelmas viſitations the ſame miniſters pay their procurations, ſome ſeven or eight, ſome ten or twelve ſhillings, ſome more, ſome leſs. But it is judged, that on a moderate computation, the archdeacons of England do yearly collect for procurations only, ſix or ſeven thouſand pounds.</p>
               <p>The next juriſdiction to be conſidered, is that of deans and their chapters.—But having already mentioned the ſeveral kinds of deans, and the manner of exerciſing their juriſdictions, I ſhall not at preſent plunge any farther into this bottomleſs barathron of eccleſiaſtical officers, and their rapines; but beg leave to conclude with the words of a late eminent prelate of the church of England, viz. Dr. <hi>G. Burnet,</hi> biſhop of Sarum, who, in a familiar diſcourſe with me on this very ſubject, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared, <hi>That the canon law and eccleſiaſtical juriſdiction were originally derived from Hell; and that thither it ought to be ſent again:</hi> And obſerving me to be ſomewhat ſtartled at his words, he continued thus; <hi>A greater than I, even an archbiſhop</hi> (naming <hi>Grindal</hi>) <hi>was alſo of this opinion:</hi> To which I only add,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Heu! heu! haec è ſulphureo fonte Eccleſiaſticorum exurgunt! Vide Mat. Paris,</hi> p. 542. Col. 2.</p>
               <p>Theſe obſervations, I humbly ſubmit to your juſt and equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble enquiry; and am (with all due reſpect)</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THAT the CHURCH labours under a real Hardſhip, with Reſpect to Ordination, is, I believe, ſufficiently evident. —That the <hi>Whig</hi> and his Confederates, would fain perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate that Hardſhip, I have demonſtrated in a former Letter; and make no Doubt that it is clear by this Time to every can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and unprejudiced Enquirer.</p>
               <p>The Independants of <hi>America,</hi> thoſe worthy Imitators of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old, like them, <q>bind heavy Burthens, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to be borne, and lay them on Men's Shoulders; but they themſelves will not move them with one of their Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</q>—Had <hi>they</hi> ſuffered a Hardſhip of the ſame Nature, tho' infinitely leſs grievous than the one abovementioned, how would the Preſs have groaned with their Complaints; ſince even in this Land of Liberty and Toleration, they raiſe ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Clamours, merely becauſe the <hi>National Church</hi> petitions for thoſe Peivileges that they already enjoy?</p>
               <p>I am far, however, from blaming a juſt Senſibility of the Grievances we <hi>may</hi> ſuffer; but that very Senſibility ought to give us a Fellow-Feeling for others, and make us unfeignedly deſirous to relieve them.</p>
               <p>If we examine the Conduct of the Champions in the preſent literary Conflict, who have entered the Liſts as Opponents to the Introduction of a Biſhop, we ſhall find them not aware of this Conſequence, or at leaſt, not influenced by it.</p>
               <p>The Hardſhip which the Church laboured under as to Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, was evident and ſtriking—To invalidate the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument ariſing from it, the <hi>Whig,</hi> with a Degree of Modeſty
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:011212_0086_0F862D8621BAF2E0"/>and Candour unparallel'd in the Annals of <hi>Grubſtreet,</hi> calls a Voyage of ſeveral Thouſand Miles amidſt the Wonders and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rils of the Great Deep, by the diminutive Epithet of, <hi>a Trip for Ordination.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"As to the Trip for Ordination (ſays he) it is far from an Inconvenience;" that is to ſay, a long and dangerous Voyage, at a great Expence, if it be called by the Name of <hi>"a Trip for Ordination,"</hi> changes its Nature, and becomes <hi>"far from an Inconvenience."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let any one addreſs a Perſon on the Rack who feels the moſt excruciating Pain, and tell him, that the reducing his Limbs to a genteel Poſition, is "far from an Inconvenience," and ſee whether his Anguiſh will be thereby alleviated, or he convinced that his Sufferings ſerve only to reduce his Limbs to a genteel Poſition.</p>
               <p>And yet, ſuch is the Logick made Uſe of by the <hi>American Whig,</hi> in his candid and judicious Lucubrations, whom I ſhall leave to enjoy the Wit, (if peradventure there be any) of the elegant Paſſage now obſerved upon—unmoleſted and alone.</p>
               <p>The Members of the CHURCH indeed, in one Senſe, are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to allow "that this is far from an <hi>Inconvenience;</hi>" for they eſteem it an intolerable Hardſhip which ſtrikes at the very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Church in <hi>America.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reaſon aſſigned why "the Trip for Ordination," is far from an Inconvenience, is, becauſe, in the <hi>Whig</hi>'s Opinion, <hi>"it doubtleſs conduces much to the reputable Figure of the Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries."</hi>—And why then ſhould not the Preſbyterian, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational or Independant Teachers, (call them what you will) take a ſimilar Trip, ſince meek-eyed Charity itſelf, may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, that many of them might make a much more <hi>reputable Figure</hi> than they do at preſent.</p>
               <p>Before I quit the <hi>American Whig,</hi> give me Leave to mention a Calumny he introduces, for no other Purpoſe, but to vilify the Church Clergy—I mean his Inſinuation, that they preach borrowed Sermons, which falſe and virulent as it is, yet, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Circumſtances, eaſy to be imagined, might be juſtified to the World, as well as their own Conſciences.</p>
               <p>We are told, Sir, in Mr. LIVINGSTON'S <hi>manly ſpirited</hi> Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Biſhop of <hi>Landaff,</hi> that <hi>"Recrimination is reputed to be juſt:"</hi> And were I inclined to recriminate, I doubtleſs could do it with the greateſt Juſtice.—I might repreſent in ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Colours, the nonſenſical Jargon and Cant, too often thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered out from the Pulpits of <hi>extempore</hi> Haranguers, to the great Diſguſt of all ſenſible Men, and the prodigious Delight
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:011212_0086_0F862D8621BAF2E0"/>of thoſe who think every Thing they cannot comprehend, a Miracle of Wiſdom and Erudition—But I ſpare the <hi>Whig</hi>'s Favourites, and leave unnoticed their "vain Repetitions," and all the <hi>Reſt and Reſidue</hi> of the bright Catalogue of <hi>new-fangled Ornaments,</hi> which compoſe their <hi>complete Syſtem of reformed Pulpit Eloquence.</hi> However, as the <hi>Whig</hi> does not think "a Trip" acroſs the Atlantic, indiſpenſably requiſite <hi>for the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of Second-hand Sermons</hi> to qualify a Church Clergyman for the Exerciſe of his Function; ſo I believe nothing elſe want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to conſtitute a right <hi>True Blue</hi> Independant Apoſtle, but a comfortable Stock of <hi>modeſt Aſſurance.</hi>" Of which, "a more than <hi>brazen Monument</hi> is to be erected," by liberally dealing out twice or thrice each <hi>Sabbath Day,</hi> to a gaping Audience, their own crude and indigeſted Notions, as the Oracles of Truth, and the Dictates of Divine Wiſdom.</p>
               <p>Such are the <hi>Whig</hi>'s Endeavours to ſurmount the Argument for a Biſhop, deduced from the Source contained in my former Letter—Let us now ſee whether any more effectual have been uſed by that <hi>learned Veteran,</hi> Dr. CHAUNCEY.</p>
               <p>In his ever memorable Anſwer to Dr. CHANDLER's <hi>Appeal,</hi> he upon this Head, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>As to the firſt, he obſerves, <q>that the going to <hi>England</hi> for Ordination, is rather an Advantage than a Diſadvantage to the Church. That as to himſelf, he ſhould eſteem it a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Circumſtance in the Caſe, where he inclined to take Orders.

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible <hi>Modeſty;</hi> and therefore, I ſhall not diſpute, that the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor would eſteem it "a happy Circumſtance" to croſs the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic, were he inclined to take Orders; or that many he had mentioned it to were ſeriouſly of the ſame Mind; or that ſome Candidates for the Miniſtry had been tampered with to receive Epiſcopal Ordination, with this <hi>ſpecial</hi> Motive, "that they would have a fine Opportunity to ſee <hi>England.</hi>"—But
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:011212_0087_0F862D8C4332AE08"/>tho' the Doctor and his Friends, as well as the Candidates above mentioned, are Perſons of ſo much Reſolution, that they "eſteem it a happy Circumſtance," to face the Dangers of the Ocean, merely to gratify an idle Curioſity; yet he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that there may be many worthy and learned Men of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Principles, and inclined to the Miniſtry, but not bleſt with <hi>ſo much I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>It may indeed be imagined, as the Doctor never laid hold of <hi>ſo happy a Circumſtance,</hi> when he was inclined to be ordained, which he might very well have done, ſince ſuch Ordination as his Sect eſteem regular, may doubtleſs be procured in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> that therefore his preſent Aſſertion is <hi>devoid of Truth,</hi> and only made to ſerve a particular Purpoſe. But as the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's Veracity is not to be queſtioned, I rather think, that he himſelf has been deceived in the preſent Caſe; for we often, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertently, apply the ſmall End of the Glaſs to view Dangers at a Diſtance, in which we conceive ourſelves not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted.</p>
               <p>But before I diſmiſs this Point, permit me to reprimand the Doctor in the ſtrongeſt Manner, for calling the Profeſſors of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it were, <hi>propter Excellentiam, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the Church</hi>—A Fault for which he muſt have known, Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi> was ſeverely cenſured, and which was at leaſt, as criminal, in the <hi>Whig</hi>'s Opinion, as Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Point (viz. the Expence) <hi>the good</hi> Doctor gets over, by ſuppoſing it to be borne by the Society for propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Goſpel—In anſwer to which, I ſhall at this Time, only produce the Words of a late Writer in the preſent Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy—<q>That the Society (ſays he) does not bear the Expence of thoſe who go hence to <hi>England</hi> for Orders, is a Fact as true, and as well known, as that <hi>England</hi> lies on one Side of the Atlantic and <hi>America</hi> on the other.— Queen ANNE indeed provided, that the Sum of <hi>Twenty Pounds,</hi> ſhould be paid out of the Public Treaſury, to ſuch Clergymen as went from <hi>England</hi> to ſettle in the Plantations; and out of this Bounty, Miſſionaries, I am informed, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received ſomewhat more than <hi>Nineteen Pounds.</hi> But what is this to the Expence of a Voyage to <hi>England,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother back again?</q>
               </p>
               <p>As to the third Point, the Doctor thinks it ſufficient, if he can <hi>invent</hi> other probable Cauſes to account for it,—To
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:011212_0087_0F862D8C4332AE08"/>ſhew the Futility of them, would be too tedious at preſent.— But even if we allow them to exiſt, the Hardſhips reſulting from the Caſe of Ordination, muſt, by all Men of Candour, be allowed to co-operate with them, and even of themſelves, to be ſufficient to produce that Effect.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt Point is, the impoſſibility that a Biſhop in <hi>England</hi> ſhould be acquainted with the Characters of thoſe who go home for Orders—Upon this, the Doctor remarks, <q>that the Caſe would not be altered for the better, were there a Biſhop in <hi>America,</hi>" becauſe, (as he ſays) "the greater Part by far of thoſe who would go to him for Orders, would be as unknown to him, by Reaſon of their great Diſtance from <hi>his Seat,</hi> as to a Biſhop in <hi>England</hi>
                  </q>—And beſides, he ſuppoſes, <q>that a Commiſſary might as well prevent this Miſchief as Biſhops, as far at it can be prevented.</q>—"But can we imagine, that a Biſhop would be conſtantly immured at his Seat, (as the Doctor calls it) ſo as to receive all his Knowledge of Perſons and Characters in the ſame defective Way, which he muſt do in <hi>England?</hi> May we not rather imagine, that he would viſit, at ſtated Times, the ſeveral Parts of the Continent; and thereby become acquainted with the Sentiments of the Public, and receive Intelligence, <hi>Vivâ Voce,</hi> from ſuch Perſons as were beſt able to give it?—By this Method, almoſt all Poſſibility of Forgery and Deception would be prevented: Nay, he might be able to obſerve the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Candidates for the Miniſtry "from their Youth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards," beginning with them at the ſeveral Seminaries of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where they are educated.</p>
               <p>The Appointment of a Commiſſary, would be but a bad <hi>Succedanium;</hi> becauſe the ſame dangerous and expenſive Voyage would remain, and Credentials, as from him, might be forged without the Poſſibility of a ſpeedy Detection; and tho' the Fraud might chance not to eſcape the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>'s Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration, yet it could ſcarce ſail of Succeſs, where the Order of Biſhops is ſo numerous as it is in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſhort, there is nothing like having the Perſon who is to ordain, upon the Spot; where he may "ſee with his own Eyes, and hear with his own Ears; whereas when at a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance he is liable to be impoſed upon by a Thouſand Artifices.</p>
               <p>The Members of the CHURCH do not want, by introducing a Biſhop, to procure a religious Eſtabliſhment, as Doctor <hi>Chaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cey</hi> declares, and the <hi>Whig</hi> and <hi>Centinel</hi> impudently aſſert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THE nature of Chriſtianity, and the errand and duties of a miniſter of the goſpel conſidered, what an be more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt than that the thirſt of the clergy after civil authority muſt be both miſchievous and criminal. They are ſent out <hi>to beſeech Men to be reconciled unto God;</hi> and the ſucceſs of their negotiations depends upon the harmony of their lives with prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the moſt exalted refinements.—Principles utterly inconſiſtent with the purſuit of worldly pleaſures and the intan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling cares of the magiſtracy.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe for inſtance that Dr. Chandler's little flock at Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth-Town, ſhould conſiſt of but five hundred ſouls; I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to affirm, that the conſcientious diſcharge of his duty ſcarce
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:011212_0088_0F862D8D0AF66D50"/>leaves him time for common recreation. Beſides what he owes to himſelf as a Chriſtian (and the beſt may cry out, who is ſufficient for the ſpiritual warfare?) how immenſe the load in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by his office of a ſhepherd, <hi>who watches for their ſouls!</hi> —I ſhall ſay nothing of the painful purſuits of his ſtudies, his public exerciſes in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, his catechitical lectures and periodical attendances at his chamber as a <hi>Ductor Dubitantium,</hi> to ſolve caſes of conſcience:—His parochial viſits alone open to view a field of labour that muſt make any miniſter tremble who would not have the <hi>blood of his people found in his ſkirts.</hi> The paſtoral care is to extend to all; ſome are to be inſtructed and others reproved.—The incautious are to be admoniſhed, the ſluggiſh to be quickened— Encouragement muſt be applied to the faint-hearted; and the backſlider, if poſſible recovered. In a word, as the variety of their caſes is endleſs, ſo are his fatigues, each demands ſkill and addreſs, and ſome will pierce a tender heart with the moſt pungent diſtreſs. What a taſk to ſtand ready for ſick and death bed calls! How is the preſumptious to be convinced? who can ſap the deluſive hopes of hypocrites, and ſupport thoſe of the dying tymid believer? But I forbear, the anxieties of the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous miniſter muſt be inconceivable: And charged with duties ſo various, what can be more abſurd and cruel than to encreaſe the burden by civil concerns foreign to his function? What more miſchievous than to abate his induſtry in ſo glorious a work, by the intoxications of worldly wealth and honour? Such a good ſhepherd the Doctor is or ought to be.—And ſeems it not ſtrange then to find him contending for the inveſtiture of the clergy with powers repugnant to their offices? Conceiving, as it was natural, that the biſhops whom he is deſirous of having in this country, might meet with preferment to civil truſts, and the clergy under their patronage be conſtituted judges and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices; and that the colonies might thence take an alarm; he endeavours to juſtify ſuch appointments, and two pages of his appeal are devoted to obviate objections to a meaſure for which fifty thouſand volumes would be utterly inſufficient; ſince rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, revelation and the experience of all nations conſpire to teach us the leſſon, that nothing can be more dangerous to church and ſtate, than the participation of the clergy in the power of the magiſtrates.—Of all orders they are moſt prone to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute.—Such is the ſect.—It ſtands recorded in the hiſtory of the world, in characters of blood.—The nature of their creeds makes no difference.—In this reſpect the poet aſſerts, an undeniable truth, that <hi>prieſts of all religions are the ſame.</hi>—Nay, the Chriſtian clergy ſeem to have ſurpaſſed
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:011212_0089_0F862D8DA82E7020"/>the Pagan prieſthood, as much in their cruelties, as in the refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned morality they were ſent out to inculcate. Power in the hands of eccleſiaſtics, raiſed antichriſt in the very boſom of the Chriſtian church; and if we may judge from what is paſt, ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil authority can never be intruſted to the clergy with ſafety to the people.
<note n="*" place="bottom">It is far from the author's deſign to depart from the honour due to the heralds of the religion of Jeſus, who as ſuch deſerve the higheſt reſpect: The clergy can boaſt, and I confeſs it with pleaſure, the moſt diſtinguiſhed ornaments of humanity. The delegation of civil power to their claſs, has nevertheleſs ever proved unfriendly both to religion and the common weal, and the reaſon is as obvious as the fact inconteſtible.</note> Secluded from the world, and ignorant of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, (I ſpeak of them as a body) they grow ſour and vindic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, over-rate their order, are impatient of oppoſition, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to freedom of thought.—Being intriguing, ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, ſyſtematical and enterpriſing, they are always an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match for the vulgar; and by the advantage of their numbers, and the devotion of their weak and bigotted adherents, natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquire a dominion the more to be feared, as their operations proceeding upon the flattering principles of advancing the glory of God, and the good of ſouls, rarely ceaſe until an implicit ſubmiſſion to their opinions is extorted.—All devotees con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract more or leſs of the ſpirit of perſecution.—But from circumſtances of condition, education and intereſt, the clergy acquire the greateſt proportion of it—All ſects will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute. The perſecuted if lifted to power will perſecute in their turn. The clergy are ſure prompters; and it is worth a remark, that when the people of New-England, who were perſecuted out of Old-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, perſecuted the Quakers, they were in a manner ruled by their miniſters.—And if this moſt peaceable of all ſects had the ſame opportunities, and a clergy to ſtimulate them, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the paſſions and infirmities common to fallible mortals, they would doubtleſs revenge the oppreſſions which their ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors have felt both in Europe and America.

                  </note> It ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be the maxim of all ſtates, and eſpecially of a Chriſtian ſtate, and above all of weak province connected as ours are, and contending for the preſervation and eſtabliſhment of our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to confine men who have ſo often abuſed the powers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

               <p>To diſpel our fears, Doctor Chandler tells us, that <hi>if the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſhould inveſt the biſhops with</hi> SOME DEGREE <hi>of civil power</hi> WORTHY THEIR ACCEPTANCE, <hi>it is inconceivable that any ſhould thereby be injured.</hi> Upon being ſo inveſted, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the inferior clergy will become juſtices and judges of the quorum, and alledges it would make no difference to the parties concerned in their proceedings, whether they were laymen or clergymen; and adds, "<hi>So if biſhops ſhould be inveſted with a</hi> PROPORTIONABLE <hi>degree of civil authority, neither could there be</hi> ANY GREAT <hi>reaſon for complaints:</hi>"—Appeal, 110, 111.</p>
               <p>As the deluſive mincings of this ſee-ſaw canting pamphlet have been already expoſed, I ſhall not ſtop to remark upon the qualifying and evaſive words <hi>ſome degree, proportionable degree, worthy of their acceptance,</hi> and <hi>any great reaſon,</hi> all doubtleſs artfully deſigned as ſo many loop-holes to creep out at, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to examine what effects this prelatical doctrine would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have in the plantations. Let us make the experiment firſt in the province of New-York.</p>
               <p>Here are above one hundred thouſand as happy ſubjects as any upon the face of the earth, and the more ſo, for being ſplit into many different proteſtant denominations. We live here in Chriſtian fellowſhip, and the liberty and peace of the goſpel. —In this delightful branch of the empire, the rights of conſcience are ſhackled by no religious teſt laws.—Every loyal proteſtant is a candidate for public honours; can offer his ſervice, and receive the rewards and munificence of the crown. —whether of one denomination or another, he is expoſed to no penalties on the ſcore of his religion, but being left to the unbiaſſed dictates of his own conſcience, may worſhip God as he pleaſes.—No ſect has a general odious preheminence, and without eſtabliſhments, tythes or church-rates (a ſmall tax not univerſal only expected) we abound with churches and places of worſhip, beyond the cenſure even of the biſhop of Landaff; have raiſed them by our own free and voluntary contributions, and without the compulſion of laws, maintain a clergy, proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our numbers, and but for a few inſtances, as unexception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as any in all Chriſtendom.</p>
               <p>Thanks to the wiſdom and policy of our Dutch anceſtors, for this happy exemption from penal and perſecuting laws, and the glorious liberty we enjoy. If the firſt ſettlers of this colony, who were all of the national reformed church of the United
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:011212_0090_0F862D8E65413F28"/>Netherlands, had been bigots to their own perſuaſion, it would often, in ancient days, have been eaſy for them to take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of neceſſitous Governors; and procure, if not acts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly to Chriſtian liberty, at leaſt diſcriminating immunities, and ill-policied endowments, out of the vacant lands of the crown.—But inſpired by the principles of generous tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, they contented themſelves with the ſaith of the Engliſh nation, in the capitulatory articles at the ſurrender by which they aſked nothing but the liberty of conſcience, in worſhip and diſcipline,—and tho' once worried and trapanned by a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted governor, into a law that expoſed themſelves and their poſterity (not excepting their own clergy) to a perpetual tax in four counties, levied for the uſe of clergymen, of whom, ſome at leaſt, as miſſionaries of the ſociety for propagating the goſpel, were at the ſame time receiving ſupport, like objects of charity, out of a fund raiſed by the alms of the people of England.— I ſay, all this notwithſtanding, they ſcorned to reſent the provocation, have ſeen, without envy, the diſtinguiſhing libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Fletcher and Cornbury, to a ſect fed out of their own bowels, and even in its infancy, aſpiring at a preheminence: And though in a ſubſequent period, by the devolution of the command upon Preſident Schuyler, the whole legiſlative autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity was in the hands of the Dutch; yet ſo far from making repriſals, they have not even attemping the repeal of the church-tax; but only avoided a repetition of that error. And to their wiſdom and generoſity we owe that influx of proteſtants, which adds daily to our proſperity, and is ſo neceſſary to the cultivation, and ſo advantageous to the landed intereſt of the colony.</p>
               <p>But to whatever cauſe our liberty and felicity is to be aſcribed, certain it is, that the permanence and ſecurity of both greatly depend upon the partition of power, among our various deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations, and the wiſdom and impartiality of the government. With two of the three branches of the legiſlature, in favour of the epiſcopalians; I mean the governor and council, who are generally of that perſuaſion, and with the power of the crown and the nation, to protect them; that ſect hath ſuch a bulwark of defence, that every ſtep taken to increaſe their ſecurity, ought to be conſidered as a demonſtration, that not their own ſafety, but miſchief to other, is the true end in view.— The ſtrength of the Dutch, and other non-epiſcopalians, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in their power to maintain a majority in the aſſembly. To which, as contributors of near nine tenths of all taxes, they ought to be ever attentive; and more eſpecially, now meaſures are purſuing by the epiſcopal clergy, to wriggle themſelves into
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:011212_0090_0F862D8E65413F28"/>power.—What! ſhall the protection of the governor and council, of king, lords and commons, be an inſufficient ſecurity to the epiſcopal churches, and all the other proteſtants in the colony be thought unconſcionable, in oppoſing a project that tends to deprive them of their weight in one ſingle branch of the legiſlature? tho' this, under God, is the main, if not the only ſecurity they have for the glorious religious liberty they at preſent enjoy.—If ever a biſhop drives his gilded equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page in our ſtreets, and ſhares in the public councils of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, and the miſſionaries are judges and juſtices in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who, but the learned Doctor of Elizabeth-Town, cannot foreſee the moſt tragical conſequences, from ſuch a prieſtly mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of power? Let us mention a few of the innumerable complaints to which it will infallibly give riſe.— And,</p>
               <p n="1">1. As a biſhop at the council board, with the clergy as ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices and judges of the quorum, and all their dependent bigots in his train, and the intereſt of the reverend bench in England on his ſide, will inſtantly poſſeſs a power, at which every go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, and eſpecially a neceſſitous one, will tremble; two branches of our legiſlature muſt fall a ſacrifice to prieſt-craft, and every meaſure of government thenceforth be dictated by eccleſiaſtical zeal.—A biſhop upon ſuch ground, will be more than mortal, if his pride and haughtineſs is not exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and that governor and council poſſeſs an uncommon ſpirit of courage, who dare to check the inſolence of a prieſt, whoſe influence will be ſufficient by a ſingle letter, to reduce them to po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>itical non entities.—And here, good Doctor, what a ſource for complaints have you overlooked!</p>
               <p n="2">2 With ſuch an aſcendency in the prelates (which would be greater here than that of all the biſhops put together in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland) and the lower clergy for judges and juſtices in our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; can any man but Dr. Chandler, be ſo betle eyed, as not to ſee, that <hi>the people immediately concerned in their proceedings, may be far otherwiſe affected, than if they were mere lay-men?</hi> Will thoſe motly compounds of Moſes and Aaron, poſſeſs ſuch angelic perfection, that no man, not even an anti-epiſcopalian, will ever have any great cauſe to complain?—The Dr. indeed may be conſcious of his own impartiality, and fitneſs to determine a controverſy between one of his church-wardens and a lay-elder of the Preſbyterian conventicle at Elizabeth-Town; but all who are ſtrangers to the rectitude and internal operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his mind, would be apt to think the cauſe in the hands of a worthy lay-juſtice, upon a more eligible footing; and that as but few of the miſſionaries can pretend to the qualifications
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:011212_0091_0F862D8F22A41A60"/>which have rendered the Dr. ſo famous, complaints againſt the judgment of ſuch eccleſiaſtico-political judges, would be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther few nor ill-grounded.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, If the places of honour not military; for it is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed at preſent, as far as I am informed, that the clergy ſhould have any command as officers in the militia; I ſay, if the only places of honour and profit are to be committed to the clergy, what ſhort work will ſuch powerful election-jobbers have, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the voices for the choice of an Aſſembly man? Only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe then, the new biſhop concerned in a plan with the enemies of America, in the mother country; (which is no improbable ſuppoſition) and the colony legiſlature at his back, and ideas preſent themſelves that fills the mind with conſternation and horror.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly, Tho' a dabbler in politics may apprehend no miſchief of this kind, it is moſt of all to be wondered at, that an endoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torated divine ſhould be ſo blind as not to foreſee any great complaints neither from men of honour and juſtice, or of real and undiſſembled piety, even of his own denomination.— Will not a reſort to the biſhop's palace at New-York or Albany, for the purpoſe of pleaſure, preferment and intrigue, occaſion their non-reſidence at their cures?—And are not their flocks in danger of being unfed, and expoſed by the proſtitution of their time and talents, to affairs of private litigation, the commitment and puniſhment of felons, the indemnity of the pariſh from baſtards, and that infinity of buſineſs, which our laws have committed to juſtices of the peace, and eſpecially to thoſe of the quorum.</p>
               <p>Let theſe hints ſuffice for the preſent, to refute the pernicious doctrine of the appeal.—A doctrine that will, if carried into practice, give riſe to complaints from all quarters.— The Doctor can ſee no very great reaſon for any, but tho' his pamphlet is recommended by a round allegation, that "nothing has been aſſerted in the courſe of his <hi>work,</hi> but what he believes upon good evidence to be true," yet thouſands are apprehenſive of complaints, from all parts and denominations, not excepting even the Prelate and the Doctor himſelf.—A project that will fill us with jealouſies, and tend to ſubjugate us to the moſt mercileſs thraldom, will firſt excite the complaints of the people, and then end in an enquiry for which the author and the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will doubtleſs have reaſon to complain, both of themſelves and each other.</p>
               <p>If the Doctor had any view of this, it appeared to him afar off, and hence perhaps the information to his ſuperiors that the preſent time, of all others beſt ſavoured his ſcheme.—
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:011212_0091_0F862D8F22A41A60"/>But the moſt urgent motive was omitted, to wit, that the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans had as yet no rich independent Barons as in the mother country, to curb the new prelates and keep them to order, but for this very reaſon (a reaſon not proper to be even hinted in the appeal) every real Chriſtian,—every ſon of liberty, ought to ſtand upon his guard, and proteſt againſt the inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the clergy with powers ſo repugnant to the pure and holy religion we profeſs. Security againſt this fruitful ſource of diſtreſs we demand; but it is ſo far from being offered, that the very advocate for an epiſcopate not only confeſſes this poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that his biſhops may acquire civil powers and preferments, but very ſagaciouſly, and doubtleſs keeping the grand end of his appeal in ſight, pleads for the diſtribution of a ſhare, not only to their lordſhips the biſhops, but to their inferior clergy. We ſee then what kind of primitive epiſcopacy America is to be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with, had ſome men their aims.</p>
               <p>☞ The KICK for the WHIPPER, No. XVII. being in Dutch is omitted in this Place, But if a Tranſlation can be procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, will be added at the End of the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume.</p>

               <p>THE XIVth Num. of the <hi>American Whig</hi> conſiſts of a very <hi>curious</hi> Letter, uſhered in by a very <hi>furious</hi> Introduction. What it was, that added this extraordinary Degree of Acidity to the native Sourneſs of the <hi>Whig</hi>'s Temper, is but little to the Purpoſe. <hi>Chymiſts</hi> tells us, that <hi>Acids</hi> when mixed with <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kalies,</hi> i. e. with Things of a Nature contrary to their own, produce the moſt furious and diſtructive Fermentations. Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly our <hi>Whig</hi> had ſeen a <hi>Tory,</hi> a <hi>Jacobite,</hi> or what is ten times worſe in <hi>his</hi> Opinion, a <hi>good honeſt</hi> CHURCHMAN:— Poſſibly <hi>Conſcience</hi>—a <hi>Thing</hi> as oppoſite to the Nature of a <hi>thorough</hi> Whig, as <hi>Alkalies</hi> to <hi>Acids</hi>—had given him a <hi>whipping</hi> through one of my Papers, for the many baſe Deſigns that he is by every Art carrying on, to the great Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance of his Majeſty's liege Subjects.—But however uncertain we may be with Regard to the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> the <hi>Effect</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident: A moſt <hi>furiouſly fluſtratious Ferment</hi> ſeized him, which ſpent itſelf in <hi>foaming, fuming,</hi> and <hi>fretting,</hi> againſt every Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that hath ſo much Regard to <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>primitive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi> as to open his Mouth, or uſe his Pen, in Defence of the <hi>venerable</hi> and <hi>Apoſtolic</hi> Order of BISHOPS, and in Support of the <hi>natural, civil</hi> and <hi>religious</hi> Rights of the CHURCH in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</hi> All ſuch Perſons are by him denominated <q>
                     <hi>ſhameleſs Scribblers,—Scribblers,</hi> who in open Defiance of all <hi>Modeſty</hi> and <hi>Decorum,</hi> are engaged in perverting Truth, propagating Falſhood, <hi>out-raging common Senſe,</hi> and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing without Offence given, the moſt numerous Denominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſtians in this Province.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Would not a Perſon who knew nothing of our <hi>Whig,</hi> but what might be gathered from this Sentence, be led to conſider him as a <hi>very baſhful, ſhamefaced ſort of a Man,</hi> who had never <hi>ſcribbled</hi> in his Life!—One, that had <hi>monopolized</hi> all

One, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was <hi>engaged</hi> in <hi>perverting Truth,</hi> and <hi>propagating Falſhood?</hi> —And would not the Perſon, who ſhould make theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, be <hi>moſt abominably miſtaken?</hi>—Of all Men in the <hi>World</hi> the <hi>Whig</hi> ſhould have been the laſt, to have mentioned <hi>ſcribbling</hi> as a Mark of Reproach; or noticed the Want of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty</hi> and <hi>Decorum</hi> in any one; or any Thing about <hi>perverting Truth,</hi> or <hi>propagating Falſhood:</hi>—For what <hi>Scribbler</hi> is more a <hi>Scribbler</hi> than himſelf, or more <hi>ſhameleſs?</hi>—Who ever wrote more "in open Defiance of all <hi>Modeſty</hi> and <hi>Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum?</hi>—Who was ever more laboriouſly diligent in <hi>tortur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>"perverting Truth."</hi> and "propagating Falſhood," than the <hi>American Whig?</hi>—Name the Man, <hi>et eris mihi magnus Apollo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What the Whig means by <hi>"out-raging common ſenſe,"</hi> I confeſs I know not. Had he given us a little more <hi>common Senſe,</hi> and a little leſs <hi>Rage,</hi> poſſibly I ſhould have underſtood him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: But to <hi>his</hi> and <hi>my</hi> Misfortune, the <hi>Ebullition</hi> of the <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of his Brain, hath been ſo <hi>ſuperlatively fluſtratious,</hi> that his Rage hath run away with his common Senſe, juſt as honeſt <hi>Teague</hi>'s Legs ran away with their Maſter.</p>
               <p>I come now to the Letter, which this <hi>fluſtratious</hi> Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preſents to us, as the genuine Production of a Member of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Church. The <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Churches in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, have ever been mutually happy, in the good Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that hath ſubſiſted between them, and I hope ever will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; notwithſtanding the vile Endeavours of the <hi>American Whig,</hi> and his <hi>Tools,</hi> to ſow Jealouſies and Animoſities in the Breaſts of theſe two Siſters.</p>
               <p>When I ſaid in a former Paper that the Power of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Church of <hi>Holland,</hi> was confined to the Claſſis, and was not given to every ordinary Paſtor, I ſaid it upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Perſon, whom I know to be every Way qualified to judge of the Truth of what he affirmed; and utterly incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſaying in this Caſe, what he did not know to be true. —But—waving all other Arguments, and Aſſertions, let us come to the Matter of Fact.—If the ordinary Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the Church of <hi>Holland</hi> have the Power of Ordination, diſtinct from the Claſſis, how comes it, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> Miniſters in this Province do not ordain? If it be ſaid, that there have been Inſtances of their ordaining.—I beg to be informed, whether a Schiſm does not ſubſiſt in the <hi>Dutch</hi> Church, upon that Account, among others?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="unknown:011212_0093_0F862D93800BAC48"/>With Regard to the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>'s unchurching all the Proteſtant Reformed Churches, I again deny it. On the contrary, ſhe hath ever looked upon them with the moſt friendly Regard, and hath given them all the Aſſiſtance that hath been in her Power. She ſettled her own-Church Government, as ſhe ſuppoſes, upon the ſure Word of God, and left others to judge for themſelves.</p>
               <p>Whatever is darkly, or not fully expreſſed, in the Writings of the inſpired Penmen of the New Teſtament, is beſt explained by the Practice of the Primitive Chriſtians—and their Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice can be known only from Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory. Now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Teſtimony of the Holy Scriptures in favour of Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy, we have the joint Practice of the univerſal Chriſtian Church, from the Apoſtles' Days, 'til within a little more than Two Hundred Years. The Argument, from the Practice of the Primitive Church, is juſt as ſtrong in Favour of Epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as it is in Favour of the Firſt-Day Sabbath, or Lord's Day; or as it is in Favour of Infant Baptiſm, or admitting Women to the Lord's Supper. When therefore, our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries will produce a plain, poſitive Text of Scripture, enjoining the baptizing of Infants, or the obſerving the firſt Day of the Week, as a Day of public Worſhip, or for admitting Women to the Lord's Supper; then I will produce as plain and as ſtrong a one in Favour of Epiſcopacy.—And when the Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> will prove her <hi>Kirk Seſſions,</hi> her <hi>Preſbyteries,</hi> her Provincial Synods, her General Aſſemblies, to be <hi>jure divine,</hi> —and if they are not <hi>jure divino,</hi> they are mere Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the State, and owe their Being to Acts of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament—I will then prove, that <hi>Spiritual Courts</hi> are <hi>jure divino.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if the Diſſenters, either in <hi>England</hi> or the <hi>Colonies,</hi> think they ſtand upon the ſame foot of Innocency, in their Sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the CHURCH, that <hi>Foreign</hi> Proteſtants do, in depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Mode of Worſhip, &amp;c. eſtabliſhed in England, they are much miſtaken. The Charge of <hi>Schiſm,</hi> in divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and rending a National Reformed Church, without any tolerable Reaſon, will be their laſting Reproach in this World; and, it is much to be feared, the Condemnation of ſome of them in the World to come.</p>
               <p>The Church, it is true, holds and teaches the Neceſſity of an uninterrupted Succeſſion of Ordinations—from the Apoſtles, in order to qualify any Man for the Chriſtian Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, or Miniſtration: And if any Perſons, who are conſcious that their Ordinations are in this Reſpect <hi>irregular</hi> and <hi>defective,</hi> will fly to the Conſequences, and talk of being <hi>unchurched, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtianed,</hi>
                  <pb n="177" facs="unknown:011212_0093_0F862D93800BAC48"/>&amp;c. I cannot help it. I unchurch nobody: But what <hi>Truth</hi> will do, concerns them <hi>much</hi> to inquire.</p>
               <p>This Writer <hi>ſeems</hi> to define a Church—for he is ſeldom clear in his Expreſſions—to be the "Members of the viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church of Chriſt,"—"aſſembled for the public Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God;"—and accuſes me of unchurching the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, Preſbyterians, &amp;c. becauſe I do not call their <hi>Meeting-Houſes</hi> CHURCHES; and of unchurching the <hi>Dutch-Church,</hi> becauſe I <hi>do</hi> call the Houſes where <hi>they</hi> meet CHURCHES.

               <p>AS my controverſy is not with the church of England, but with thoſe of the bigots of that communion, who contend for an American epiſcopate; I have, through the whole courſe of theſe papers, avoided to oppugn any tenet or ceremony held by epiſcopalians, except in thoſe inſtances in
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:011212_0094_0F862D943735DD88"/>which the great champion for the convention hath rendered it abſolutely neceſſary, by inducing therefrom an argument in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of his darling project. For this reaſon, I ſhould deem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t no concern of mine, did every man in America, think proper to have himſelf confirmed every day of the year. But is confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation urged as an argument for introducing ſpiritual lords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Majeſty's dominions, and repreſented as Dr. Chandler does, in a ſenſe not held by the church to which he belongs; the refutition of it falls directly within any province, and I ſhall accordingly conſider it, without the leaſt intention of giving of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to any man, and caring very little what offence is taken at it, by thoſe who have lately thought fit to urge it in their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, in order to diſquiet weak minds, and increaſe the party in favour of an American prelate.</p>
               <p>As ambition ever wants a ladder to climb to dignity, it is not wonderful to find a certain ſett of clergymen in this country, ſo fond of introducing the hierarchy among us. Could their aſpiring views be gratified without danger to the religious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of millions, we ſhould make no objections; but until they have convinced us, by demonſtrative arguments, that an epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate upon the Engliſh plan, will not be productive of the like events in America, which it has produced in England, we ſhall never ceaſe to oppoſe, as men, who have at ſtake the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable of all priveleges on this ſide of Heaven; in which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition we are ſure of forty-five fiftieths of all America to back us.</p>
               <p>Doctor Chandler and his brethren are ſenſible that one of the moſt ſucceſsful artifices to blind the populace, is to perſuade them, that without ſuch a dignitary they muſt want ſome pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege eſſential to their ſalvation; or at leaſt to their advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in religion. To this purpoſe the want of confirmation is urged as a grievance, only to be moved by his Lordſhip's arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val. And indeed if the people are convinced that they cannot be confirmed in poſſeſſion or enjoyment of the gifts and graces of our divine religion, without the <hi>laying on of the hands</hi> of a prelate; if the <hi>ſanctifying,</hi> if the <hi>quickening,</hi> nay, if the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree of the <hi>preventing</hi> and <hi>comforting influences</hi> of the ſacred ſpirit, is confined to the hands of a biſhop, or confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by this boaſted rite, I applaud the convention in their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of a <hi>mitred apoſtle.</hi>—No temporal good bears any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to this ſpiritual bleſſing; and we might chearfully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the loſs of many privileges could we thereby obtain men of ſuch extenſive power and utility.</p>
               <p>But I fancy there are few of the ſenſible epiſcopalians them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this country, ſo much the dupes to prieſtcraft, or ſo
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:011212_0094_0F862D943735DD88"/>ignorant of their bibles, as not to know that there is not the leaſt ſhadow of ſuch a thing in the ſacred volume. And does the Doctor himſelf really believe, that the <hi>gift of the holy ſpirit</hi> in any kind or degree, is in <hi>this our day,</hi> conferred by the hards of a man? Can it be imagined by any rational creature, acquainted with the oeconomy of our religion, that the prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſaving operations of the almighty ſpirit, ever were, or now are at the diſpoſal of a biſhop?—That they may be conferred by a worm of the duſt when he pleaſes? Were this the caſe, adoration itſelf would only be a ſufficient honour paid to his Lordſhip whenever he came!</p>
               <p>Will the Doctor anſwer us, that tho' the holy ghoſt is not in reality conveyed by that means, it is nevertheleſs appointed as <hi>a ſign of its actual conveyance</hi> to the perſon confirmed, <hi>"to certify him of God's gracious favour and goodneſs?"</hi> We cannot but aſk whether the biſhop is to <hi>certify</hi> this to <hi>all,</hi> without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, or to thoſe only <hi>who make the profeſſion with ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty?</hi> If only to the latter, he had need to be <hi>the ſearcher of hearts,</hi> to be ſure that they are ſincere: If to all without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction (as is uſually done) tho' many are moſt inſincere and ungodly, then he <hi>certifies to them a falſhood.</hi> Nor can we ſuppoſe that God ever gave him power to ratify and confirm that, as a fact, to any one, which in moſt inſtances muſt prove falſe, and in all is uncertain.</p>
               <p>Will it be ſaid, that the impoſition of hands is only a <hi>ſign to ſignify the giving the holy ghoſt, to enable us to fulfill the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the goſpel covenant?</hi> Then is this <hi>rite</hi> erected into a <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> of equal importance with baptiſm itſelf; and the church of England has at leaſt three ſacraments; for her own definition of a ſacrament is <q>
                     <hi>an outward and viſible ſign of an inward and ſpiritual grace, given unto us, ordained by Chriſt himſelf, as a means whereby we receive the ſame, and a pledge to aſſure us thereof.</hi>
                  </q> But I can as eaſily believe that there are <hi>ſeven ſacraments,</hi> as that there are <hi>three.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I wiſh the Doctor had been a little more explicit, and told us diſtinctly, what he means by confirmation, and what end it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers. He has, it is true, given us a ſketch of the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion office, by which to gueſs it out; but that is as confuſed as his own deſcription. However on reading the 23d page, or thereabouts, it would appear to us, that the moſt important part of confirmation is, the <hi>conferring of the holy ghoſt by the impoſition of hands,</hi> not in his miraculous influences, which he thinks are ceaſed, but in his <hi>ſanctifying and preventing influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> Now tho' the bare mention of ſuch a thing is ſhocking; yet with Americans, with a knowing, an enquiring people,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:011212_0095_0F862D9467922C38"/>this is urged as an argument for the neceſſity of prelatical bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in this country: How greatly to be deplored the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py fate of America, that for near two ages its numerous inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants have been deprived of the mercy of a biſhop's hand!</p>
               <p>But the Doctor's notion of confirmation differs from that of the church of England herſelf—his arguments are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient—the thing is inconſiſtent—and as prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed in the church of England, pernicious. If I prove theſe things, I hope the good people of this country will not be diſtreſſed in their minds for want of an epiſcopate on this account.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Doctor's notion of confirmation differs from that of the church of England herſelf. She only goes ſo far as to ſay, that <q>It hath been a ſolemn ancient and <hi>laudable cuſtom</hi> continuing from the apoſtles times.</q> But the Doctor is wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, and adopts biſhop Taylor's aſſertion, that it is an holy rite, a <hi>divine ordinance.</hi> Now in ſpite of the <hi>Terminus a quo,</hi> or any other ill-quoted ſcrap of ſchool divinity, I am obliged to conceive that there is a wide difference between an <hi>antient cuſtom,</hi> however <hi>laudable,</hi> and a <hi>divine ordinance.</hi> For an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance I humbly conceive we muſt find ſome plain appointment in ſcripture; and not receive any thing as ſuch, merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe uncertain tradition, or the hiſtory of the ancients, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us that it was a cuſtom in primitive times. If it is an ordinance of God, pray tell us where it is ordained in the word of God; and think not, good Doctor, that we ſhall take it upon St. Jerome's word, and his infamous miſapplication of that paſſage in the <hi>Acts,</hi> any more that we ſhall take it upon your own aſſertion. That the paſſage in Acts is infamouſly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied, we ſhall preſently evince. That the <hi>ſacrament, word</hi> and <hi>prayer,</hi> are divine ordinances, no one can properly diſpute, becauſe they are plainly ordained in the ſcriptures. But where do we find the inſtitution of <hi>confirmation</hi> according to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors's notion of it, which muſt be more important than ever I conceived any of the ſacraments to be?</p>
               <p>Had the firſt reformers of the church of England, who compoſed the office of confirmation, intended to have it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as a divine ordinance, they would have called it ſo, in plain terms, and not left the Dr. ſuch hard labour to prove that they meant ſo. But as far as I can ſee, they never had any ſuch meaning, and he has plainly perverted their intention. It is well known, that none of the reformed churches did at firſt admit it as a divine inſtitution; and none but the church of England, paid ſo much reſpect to the church of Rome, as even to
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:011212_0095_0F862D9467922C38"/>retain under the notion of a <hi>laudable cuſtom,</hi> what that miſtreſs of harlots had taught as a <hi>divine ordinance.</hi> Nay, many of the wiſeſt Romaniſts themſelves did at the time of the reformation, give up its being <hi>an ordinance of divine right;</hi> as may be ſeen in the hiſtory of the Council of Trent. Nor had it any longer been retained in the Romiſh church, had not the influence of the Pope carried it, being thereto incited by a fear of hard im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations upon the infallibility of the Roman ſee. But the Doctor and his high-flying fraternity, are for going back, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of advancing in reformation. Inſtead of joining his church in calling it only a <hi>laudable cuſtom,</hi> he aſſerts it to be a divine ordinance.</p>
               <p>It ſeems that it was in St. Jerom's day a <hi>laudable cuſtom</hi> for miniſters of the goſpel, or biſhops to <hi>go abroad</hi> to catechiſe all who had been baptized, and to implore a bleſſing upon them in a ſolemn manner when he had done. That this was a <hi>laud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and ancient cuſtom</hi> we do not diſpute; and indeed the ſame cuſtom is practiſed in all churches more or leſs to this day. Nay would our <hi>zealous, humble and painful</hi> epiſcopal clergy, inſtead of waiting for the biſhop, do more of this kind, it would be no harm. If this is what is meant by confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and this is all that was anciently meant by it, as far as I have been able to trace it; I cannot ſee why the common Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter may not do it; or to what ſtrange cauſe it is to be aſcribed that the whole of this <hi>uſeful cuſtom</hi> is monopolized by the dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſan biſhops</p>
               <p>I do not object to the <hi>ancient and laudable cuſtom,</hi> of cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing young perſons, and aſking a profeſſion of their faith or aſſent to their baptiſm, before they come to the ſacrament of the Lord's ſupper. This ſort of confirmation is well enough; but none ſuppoſe a mitred biſhop eſſentially neceſſary to this. And as to the <hi>poſture in which</hi> a bleſſing was anciently implored by the biſhops, whether it was by <hi>laying on of hands.</hi>— by holding them <hi>erect,</hi> or only <hi>over</hi> the head; what is this to us, while God has left us to chooſe in the matter that poſture which to us appears moſt ſolemn and convenient? If there is any divine inſtitution of a poſture, let it be produced. But if none, as the ancient miniſters of the goſpel uſed their liberty, ſo let us.—But when St. Jerom gives to any peculiarities of a cuſtom the force of a divine command; and that only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was unniverſally conſented to in the church; we muſt differ from him, and not take the <hi>name</hi> of a ſaint for an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, If univerſal conſent of a church to a thing proves it to be a <hi>divine inſtitution;</hi> the <hi>giving the Lord's ſupper to infants</hi> was by divine inſtitution, for the Doctor can probably inform
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:011212_0096_0F862D95275CDBC8"/>us of the time when this groſs abſurdity was generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to throughout the Chriſtian world.</p>
               <p>The truth is, it was cuſtomary in the primitive times to ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techiſe, to aſk a profeſſion of their faith, or an aſſent to their engagements in baptiſm. In proceſs of time this <hi>aſſent</hi> came to be called <hi>confirmation,</hi> as therein the catechumen did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and bind himſelf a new.—The biſhop did afterwards uſually pray for a bleſſing upon them; as is uſually practiſed in all churches; and this he did in that <hi>poſture</hi> which to him ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared proper. This was the <hi>antient and laudable cuſtom;</hi> and as long as it continues under that name and ſo practiſed, we have no objections. But ſuperſtition, ever fond of erecting any good cuſtom into an ordinance to be of as much force as any of the poſitive inſtitutions of Chriſt, firſt gave this the name of a <hi>divine ordinance,</hi> then made it one of the <hi>ſeven ſacraments.</hi> The act of the catechumen in <hi>aſſenting</hi> to his baptiſm, was the <hi>confirmation:</hi> But the fondneſs of biſhops to aſſume importance, led them to teach, that the more eſſential part of confirmation was the impoſition of <hi>their</hi> important <hi>hands;</hi> as if this was the ratification of the covenant, and the holy ſpirit deſeended ſomehow thro' their conſecrated arms.</p>

"Calling Meeting-houſes by the name of <hi>Churches,</hi>" Sq.

I do alſo ſincerely declare, that my Scruples in this Reſpect have never been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by all what I have ſeen, either in the Appeal, or other Tracts upon the Subject.

               <head>From Mr. PARKER'S GAZETTE, Oct. 3. The AMERICAN WHIG. [NUMB. XXX.]</head>
               <head type="sub">The concluſion of the Subject began in our laſt.</head>
               <p n="2">2d. BUT the Doctor's arguments in ſupport of confirmation, according to his notion of it, are inſufficient. Let him not take it amiſs, when I ſay they are perfectly weak. The Teſtimony of the Church of England, the ſuppoſed antiquity of the practice, and three quotations of ſcripture, are all he has to produce on this head.</p>
               <p>The teſtimony of the Church of England, has already ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be rather againſt him, as ſhe only avows as an old cuſtom, what he inſiſts upon as a divine ordinance. And pray is there any need of ſetting America in an uproar, merely for the ſupport of an old cuſtom, however laudable the Church of England may think it? Eſpecially when there is no reaſon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignable, why a Preſbyter cannot anſwer all the purpoſes as well as his Lordſhip? But if the Church of England did avow it as an ordinance, we are diſpoſed in this country to aſk her for her vouchers.</p>
               <p>As to its antiquity, this writer would have us believe, that it was in the firſt ages of the Church undiſputed—But what means the Doctor, by ſuch aſſertions? Does he ſuppoſe, that no one in America can detect him in ſuch miſrepreſentations? Does he imagine the knowledge of ancient facts to be wholly engroſſed by him and his fraternity? Let him ſhew us, if he can, the leaſt mention of this rite in any author before Tertullian. Near the beginning of the third century that father mentions this among many moſt abſurd and ridiculous rites, that had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been introduced into the Church. Let him triumph if he will, in the teſtimony of St. Jerome, which is ſtill later, and indeed overſets itſelf, by its abſurd quotation of Acts, as well as by its ſtrenuous arguing for a rite, for which himſelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges there was no occaſion, becauſe the whole world con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.</p>
               <p>The ancient good cuſtom which the Doctor would have a divine ordinance, has been moſt apparently corrupted by the church of Rome, and adopted by the Church of England, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to many other parts of their ſyſtem, in which the cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy aſſume to themſelves the prerogatives of God.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="190" facs="unknown:011212_0100_0F862D991D2FEC80"/>3. St. Jerome's quotation of that paſſage in Acts 8. appears full as abſurd as it does in Doctor Chandler's appeal. Be ſo kind courteous reader, as to take the New-Teſtament, and for your own ſatisfaction in this matter, turn to the 14th, 15th and 16th verſes of the chapter—read the whole paſſage, and then judge whether there is any thing like confirmation there.</p>
               <p>The ſtate of the caſe is plainly this,—The goſpel had been preached in Samaria—many of thoſe mongrel Jews believed it, and were baptized.—The apoſtles hearing this, ſent two of their number, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> to ſtrengthen them and confer upon them the miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghoſt; and this was uſually done by the 'laying on of hands and prayer.' The effect of which was that 'they ſpake with tongues &amp;c.' By this, they themſelves were not only ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but each private Chriſtian, had thereby the means in his hands of giving conviction to others. And it is remarkable, that this gift of the Holy Ghoſt was ſometimes conferred before baptiſm, as in the caſe of Cornelius the centurion, and thoſe who were with him; from which it appears to a demonſtration, that it was nothing like what the C. of England pretends to, for their confirmation in its very nature ſuppoſes baptiſm to have gone before. In the inſtance of Samaria, Simon the magician was a ſpectator, and forced to conſent to the demonſtration of Chriſtianity, given by the miraculous effuſion of the ſpirit. He had long got his living by ſorcery, and now avarice led him to covet the power exerciſed by the apoſtles. He offers money to purchaſe it, but only obtains a curſe. Now, good Dr. can you imagine, that it was only the power of conferring the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying or ſupporting influences of the ſpirit that the magician wanted? Was his pious ſoul ſo deſirous of conveying ſpiritual bleſſings to mankind, that he could not reſt without the power of doing it? Was it then that he coveted the office of a biſhop? Sure an inſpired apoſtle, ſince that day, commends that cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the beſt gifts, and particularly the office in queſtion. And if this was all, you cannot but be ſtruck with horror at that ſentence, <hi>"Thy money periſh with thee!"</hi> Would an apoſtle have an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>thematized a good man for coveting to be a biſhop, and being willing to part with ſome of his money for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice? It appears to you, and every man with full evidence, that he wanted no ſuch thing as the power of confirmation— he did not want to benefit the ſouls of men, by conferring the inviſible influences of the preventing ſpirit, but it was covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that led him to wiſh for the power of working miracles, and an ability to convey that power, expecting by this means to enrich himſelf. And does it not follow with irreſiſtable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:011212_0100_0F862D991D2FEC80"/>that it was the gift of miracles here conferred by Peter and John? <q>
                     <hi>And when Simon ſaw that through the laying on of the hands of the apoſtles, the Holy Ghoſt was given.</hi>
                  </q> I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat Dr. Chandler, I call upon all the hierarchy of England, to ſhew us how Simon got glaſſes ſufficiently fine immediately to ſee, that the Holy Ghoſt was conferred upon the Samaritans in his gracious and preventing influence.—If theſe are inviſible to mortal eyes, I hope we ſhall have leave to conclude, that what the ſorcerer ſaw, was that "the gil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of miracles was conferred' by their immediate exertion of it. Is the age of miracles at an end? How infinitely abſurd is it then, maſter appellant, to bring this inſtance, to patronize your confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on! Are Americans ſo ignorant, as to induce you to hope for riſing to dignity, by impoſing upon their credulity? Shew us the biſhop veſted with like power, to confer the gifts of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, before you appeal to us for the juſtice of your cauſe: But with all the te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ptation, do not think that we ſhall even then turn into Simoniacs, and be willing to purchaſe the gift of miracles by the loſs of our religious liberty.</p>
               <p>As for Acts 19. which is his ſecond text; I remark in the firſt place, that the Dr. acknowledges the tranſaction to be the ſame in kind with that in Samaria.—This conceſſion after what has been ſaid, is enough to ſhew that it is nothing to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The world muſt own the juſtice of another remark, i. e. that he has unfairly ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ppreſſed the laſt clauſe of the verſe, which if he had not, he would have refuted himſelf. But ſince he would not recite it, we will do it for him, and reply no farther.</p>
               <p>After they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jeſus. <q>And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghoſt came on them, and they ſpake with Tongues, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As for the 3d text, where he finds <q>the doctrine of baptiſm and laying on of hands,</q> mentioned by the apoſtles, I have as good a right to apply the laying on of hands here, to that in preſbyter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>al ordination, as he has to confirmation. And if he can find a ſolid argument merely in the poſition of the words laying on of hands, after the word baptiſm, let it be adduced.</p>
               <p>And is this all the foundation, my country men, to build ſo ſtrange an ordinance upon? It is all that any man has yet laid. And do you not ſee, that this argument to catch your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, is nothing more than m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>re artifice? And ſhall the want of confirmation lead you to conſent to the importation of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:011212_0101_0F862E13630FC8C8"/>tyranny? Pray open your eyes, and judge for yourſelves. Doth People in England, who have been confirmed, ſpeak with tongues, and propheſy? Or will the Doctor's biſhop work miracles for you?—</p>
               <p>But confirmation as practiſed in the Church of England, is not only without foundation, but inconſiſtent and pernicious. Inconſiſtent—as, tho' it is confeſſed, that the ſacraments, and particularly baptiſm, is a more grand and important ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; yet the miniſters of baptiſm are not allowed to be of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient dignity to adminiſter confirmation.</p>
               <p>Pernicious it is, as it leads men to a falſe ſecurity in their ſins. After the catechumen anſwers, that he aſſents to the vows made for him in baptiſm, the biſhop, without regard to his ſincerity or inſincerity, declares in a ſolemn addreſs to God himſelf, that, <q>he has vouchſafed to regenerate theſe his ſervants, with water and the Holy Ghoſt; and to give them the forgiveneſs of all their ſins.</q> Amazing aſſertion! and by what authority does he declare, that a particular man's ſins are all forgiven? Then laying his hand upon the head of each, he <q>certifies him by that ſign, of God's gracious favour and goodneſs to him.</q> But who has told him, that theſe perſons are regenerated and pardoned? Who gives him power to certify to every one, who comes for confirmation, that he is in God's favour? Where does he find this ceremony in the bible? The conduct of moſt, is ſufficient to convince the world that the biſhop's declaration is falſe. This is pernicious to Chriſtianity itſelf, among its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; but ſtill more ſo, to the ignorant, unthinking and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceiving part of the world. They are taught to look upon the biſhop as an ambaſſador from Jeſus Chriſt, and ſucceſſor of the apoſtles, who knows the will of God. And when they hear this venerable perſon, ſo ſolemnly declaring that they are rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated and pardoned, what wonder if they really think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo; and upon theſe wretched grounds indulge a confident ſecurity of their future happineſs?</p>
               <p>Americans want no ſuch pernicious bait to poiſon their ſoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He repreſents the American Churchman as reflecting on a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an government, for "depriving a National Church of a right eſſential to the Church of CHRIST; whereas he rather com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the government, for having depriv'd her of what was only PERHAPS eſſential to her well-being, in order to avoid
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:011212_0102_0F862E158452B850"/>what wou'd have probably conduc'd much to her worſe-being.—The Whig alſo, he THINKS, has in like manner reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on "the kings of the houſe of <hi>Hanover.</hi>" In his 12th. No. indeed the Whig ſays, that "the moderation and humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our preſent ſovereign and his predeceſſors of the houſe of <hi>Hanover,</hi> have of late years reſtrained, and at preſent check, High Church fury; but farther, ſo far as I can find, ſaith not the A. Whig. So that on the whole, Sq. T. himſelf has cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly learned the "ſcurvy trick of lying for" what—is not "the Truth."</p>
               <p>Of all the grievances urg'd by Sq. T. Par. 7th, for redreſs of which he claims for the CLERGY an uncontroulable right to petition the King, one only is a grievance peculiar to the Clergy, and, if others bear the expence of their Trips to London, part of that one only, viz. the Riſk of their own dear Fleſh and Blood. So that unleſs Sq. T. can prove, that they were authoriz'd, not only by their reſpective pariſhioners, but even by a majority at leaſt of America Church men, he can with ſcarce greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety argue from the ſuppos'd grievances a right in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention to petition the King. &amp;c. for a general American Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate, than their right to petition for redreſs of the grievances of the Catholic Laity of Canada.</p>
               <p>The Clergyman in a neighbouring County, whom Sq. T. ſo maliciouſly ſneers at, is indeed a candid, catholic gentleman, and therefore (in things indifferent) can become all things to all men, but is no ſuch Weather-cock as many I could mention have proved themſelves; for, tho' he can eaſily turn his head to any ſcriptural point of the compaſs, he has always ſtood im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveably fix'd, in ſpite of frequent zealous tho' gentle puffs, from the mouths of ſome of our late bluſtering <hi>Epiſcopalian</hi> Bellowers, and never yet veer'd round to Epiſcopal Ordination. If Sq. T. indeed believes "that there are ten people of other denominations who are willing and deſirous of having biſhops in America, for one Churchman that is againſt it," I beg leave to recommend to his ſerious peruſal II. Theſſalonians, ii. chap. 11. ver.</p>
               <p>In the honour of the univerſity of Oxford, Sq. T. ſeems to be more intereſted than I am;—but if the diſſenters fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd the Meaſures of K. James II. it evidently was, becauſe arbitrary as they might be, they at leaſt tended to knock off the "Fetters" with which, through Epiſcopal Influence, they themſelves were ſtill ſhackled; and therefore no wonder they afterwards "ſhifted about" in favour of the Prince of ORANGE, who they flattered themſelves wou'd, as he ſoon after his eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment did, grant them the wiſhed for toleration. If they
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:011212_0102_0F862E158452B850"/>for certain reaſons called the Papiſts their good Brethren; tell me, Sq. T. who are they who now-a-days, without any ſuch neceſſity, treat them as ſuch. Actions ſpeak louder than words, Mr. <hi>Whipper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The pretended letter from the American Whig, is ſuch a ſtupid unmeaning thing, that, as it has doubtleſs excited bluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, for Sq. T. in many of his fellow-partizans, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of all his readers, it certainly deſerves from me not one-ſingle ſyllable by way of animadverſion.</p>

               <p>I HAVE heard of a Sort of Men who made it their Buſineſs to prove, by Words multiplied for the Purpoſe, that <hi>White</hi> is <hi>Black</hi> and <hi>Black</hi> is <hi>White,</hi> as they were paid. The Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Talents of the <hi>American Whig,</hi> are ſuch, as eminently fit him for this Employment; and was I concerned in a Cauſe that needed <hi>ſuch</hi> Management, of all Perſons upon Earth HE ſhould be my Advocate, provided I was able, or could afford to <hi>out-pay</hi> my Antagoniſt. What ſurpriſing Dexterity have we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſeen, in the Courſe of his Papers! And yet Exploits more ſurpriſing than any he has hitherto performed, are ſtill to be expected, before he retires from the View of the Public. For he has promiſed not to quit the Stage until he has demoliſhed
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:011212_0103_0F862E16217746A8"/>every Argument that has been, or can be, produced in Behalf of American Biſhops—and has ſhewn that the moſt harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Epiſcopate in this Country, unleſs NEGROES (aye gentle Reader, NEGROES) be the Biſhops, would have a more fatal Tendency, even than the late obnoxious <hi>Stamp-Act.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I now requeſt the Reader's Attention to his <hi>Fifteenth</hi> Exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made to the Public on <hi>June</hi> 20th, as a curious Specimen of his Abilities in this Way. In this <hi>not-able</hi> Performance he tumbles, he twiſts, and plays the Monkey, with ſuch Agility, ſhat every Woman and Child, that beholds him, is ready to cry out, <hi>Did you ever ſee ſo queer a Creature!</hi> His attempt is to undermine and overthrow a Reaſon, aſſigned by Dr. <hi>Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi> in his Appeal (Page 58), for which the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in America at this Time, has a peculiar Claim to the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and Aſſiſtance of our Superiors in the Mother Country. This Reaſon is founded on the late remarkable Diſplay of Divine Goodneſs in Favour of the Britiſh Intereſts in the American Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies</p>
               <p>In Order to judge properly of this Attempt, it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to place before the Public the Doctor's Argument, in the Words of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> "As America is the Region (ſays he) wherein the Divine Goodneſs has been more remarkably diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in Favour of the Britiſh Nation; ſo, America is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently the very Ground, on which ſome ſuitable Monument of religious Gratitude ought to be erected. This ſhould be of ſuch a Nature as to be viſible to the World, and that the Honour of the ſupreme Ruler of Events may be thereby immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted. Now as the Honour of God is moſt directly promoted by public Worſhip—as that Worſhip muſt be moſt accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him wherein the Praiſes and Adorations of his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are regularly offered him, in the ſolemn Offices of the pureſt and beſt Religion—and as the national Religion muſt be ſuppoſed beſt to anſwer theſe Characters, in the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Opinion; it neceſſarily follows, that the State of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Religion here, has a Right, on this Occaſion, to the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Attention and Conſideration of thoſe, who are entruſted with the Direction of our public Affairs." The Application of this general Reaſoning to the Purpoſe of an Epiſcopate the Dr. makes in his next Paragraph. The Church of England in America, is there ſaid to be in the utmoſt Diſtreſs for want of Biſhops. In this Caſe. and on this Occaſion. <hi>She earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and She only requeſts, that proper Remedies may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for her preſent Sufferings—She</hi> WISHES FOR NO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THING <hi>which ſhall be thought inconſiſtent with the Rights and Safety of others. She aſks nothing, but what has been granted to
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:011212_0103_0F862E16217746A8"/>others, without any ill Conſequences; and She relies on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Affection and Juſtice of the Nation, to raiſe her to this</hi> EQUALITY. This is the Doctor's Argument, and it appears to me to be very fair, ſtrong and concluſive.</p>
               <p>Let us now ſee in what Manner, and by what Arts, the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Whig</hi> endeavours to ſubvert it. Has he the Hardineſs to deny the Truth of any of theſe ſeveral Propoſitions? No: the Truth of them is ſo evident, that a direct Denial of it, he knows would deſtroy the wretched Remains of his Reputation. does he then candidly acknowledge the Force of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? No: he is too well acquainted with his Trade, and too true to his Cauſe, to do this; and yet he ſeems more than to half-acknowledge it. For of one Propoſition he ſays, "to be ſure a Denial of it would be a flat Rejection of all Obligations to the Deity'—and of another, "it will not meet with any Oppoſition," and ſo forth. Well; but does he not, at leaſt quit an Argument that he is unable to confute, and of the Strength of which his own Conceſſions imply a Conviction? No: ſo fair a Conduct is inconſiſtent with his Character, and would ruin his Plan. In what Manner then does he contrive to carry his Point? The Reader need not be told, that he has <hi>Two</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines by which he performs almoſt all his Operations, as he knows how to bring them to bear upon any Object; and with <hi>theſe</hi> he falls to work in the preſent Caſe. The Uſe of <hi>one,</hi> is to raiſe a Prejudice againſt the Argument, by ſpeaking of it contemptuouſly—and of <hi>the other,</hi> to puzzle and obſcure it, until the Force and Propriety of it, if poſſible, are made to diſappear.</p>
               <p>In the firſt Place, finding the Argument too ſolid to give Way to the Impreſſions of his Teeth, he mumbles and beſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers it, in Order to render it odious and offenſive. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning and Language of the <hi>Appeal,</hi> on the Subject in Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he calls "prieſtly Cant and Jargon;" and every one knows that <hi>Cant</hi> and <hi>Jargon</hi> are diſagreeable Things, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proceeding from Prieſts or <hi>Whigs.</hi> The Advocates for A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican Biſhops he vilifies with the Title of God-makers;" but by the ſame Figure their Oppoſers, I mean ſuch as our <hi>Whig,</hi> may be called <hi>Devil-maker's:</hi> a Sort of Manufactures not more reputable than the other. For if we were to judge of an Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Biſhop from the Repreſentation which is weekly given of him, we ſhould conclude him to be at leaſt as <hi>bad as the Devil.</hi> Nay, the <hi>American Whig,</hi> diſcovers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>rong Symptoms of wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to inſpire a Belief, that a Biſhop in this Country would be <hi>worſe</hi> than the Devil; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> pretends to abhor him to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, to which, if we may judge from the Immorality of his
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:011212_0104_0F862E16E6A97DD0"/>Writings, he does not abhor the Devil himſelf Again; Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy he preſents to the Public under the Image of a "devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Monſter," and the Scheme for the <hi>Settlement</hi> of an Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Epiſcopate which is propoſed in the <hi>Appeal,</hi> he tricks off in the Attire of "an <hi>Eſtabliſhment</hi> of ſpiritual Bondage in the Land of religious Liberty." This is a ſmall <hi>Spicilege</hi> of the Flowers of thy Rhetoric, O <hi>American Whig!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From reviling and beſlavering, this extraordinary diſputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> proceeds to the Buſineſs of <hi>puzzling</hi> and <hi>obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</hi> If "there be (ſays he) any Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> or Concluſion in his (Dr. <hi>Chandler</hi>'s) Argument, it plainly conſiſts in this Poſition, that <hi>Epiſcopacy and not Chriſtianity is the national Religion.</hi>" I know no one that ſuppoſes "Epiſcopacy and not Chriſtianity <hi>to be</hi> the nationable Religion" in any other Senſe, than <hi>Non-Epiſcopacy</hi> or <hi>Anti-Epiſcopacy,</hi> and not Chriſtianity, is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of <hi>Whigs</hi> and Diſſenters; and all the Argument the <hi>Appeal</hi> implies is, that <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> as taught in Scripture and preſerved by a Church under a Form of Government which is epiſcopal, is the national Religion. If the Reader will take the Trouble to review the Argument, he will ſee its Force, and be in no Danger of being miſled by ſuch flimſy Sophiſtry.</p>
               <p>Indeed the general Force of it, the <hi>American Whig</hi> himſelf can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid confeſſing, He will allow it to conclude for "eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing an <hi>anniverſary Thankſgiving,</hi> to be celebrated in all the epiſcopalian and non-epiſcopalian Churches in the Nation;" but he cannot bear that it ſhould conclude any Thing in Favour of an Epiſcopate. As to his <hi>anniverſary Thankſgiving</hi> I have no Objections to it, as it may be <hi>one</hi> Way of properly expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the national Gratitude; but it would by no Means pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude ſuch <hi>other</hi> Expreſſions of it as are <hi>equally</hi> proper. If there is any Weight in the Argument, it muſt operate as effectually in Favour of <hi>all</hi> proper Expreſſions of Gratitude, as of any <hi>ſingle</hi> Expreſſion of it. And particularly, as to the Caſe now in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, the Writer's Scheme of an <hi>anniverſary Thankſgiving</hi> would but increaſe the Abſurdity of refuſing us Biſhops. By a national Appointment of an anniverſary Thankſgiving, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appears in a <hi>religious</hi> Character; but it is peculiarly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with <hi>this</hi> Character to let the Cauſe of Religion notoriouſly ſuffer, when there is Power to prevent it.</p>
               <p>Chriſtians unhappily are divided in Sentiments, and have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med themſelves into different Societies. Amidſt this Variety, every Chriſtian joins himſelf with that Society which he eſteems to be moſt perfect, or, in other Words, moſt agreeable to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of CHRIST. Accordingly every Chriſtian, eſpecially in a free Country, muſt be ſuppoſeſt to believe that particular
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:011212_0104_0F862E16E6A97DD0"/>Mode of Chriſtianity to be moſt perfect, which he is known to have adopted, the Preſumption being, that upon this Principle he gave it the Preference. In like Manner, whatever Mode or Form of Religion any free Nation has thought fit to adopt and eſtabliſh, muſt be looked upon as the moſt perfect in the general Opinion of that Nation. For this only Reaſon it has been made the national Religion; and thoſe who adhere to it, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its Inſtitutions, are called the Members of the <hi>Church</hi> of that Nation. Now in the American Colonies there is a vaſt Body of People, including "Whites, Blacks and Browns," who by Examination or by Education have been led to give the Preference to that particular Mode and Syſtem of Chriſtianity, which alſo in the Opinion of our Nation (the <hi>Whig</hi> will be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to underſtand that I do not mean the <hi>Scotch</hi> Nation) is the moſt perfect. Theſe Americans, having received for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion the Religion of the Nation; nothing can be plainer, than, that <hi>their</hi> Religion, and the <hi>national</hi> Religion—<hi>their</hi> Church and the <hi>national</hi> Church, are one and the ſame—and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that they are Members of THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND IN AMERICA.</p>
               <p>Let us now ſuppoſe an <hi>anniverſary Thankſgiving</hi> appointed to be religiouſly obſerved throughout the Nation, on the before-mentioned Occaſion, and the Application for an American Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate rejected; how natural would it be to make the following Reflections. The Engliſh Nation, in <hi>one</hi> Inſtance, has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the Character of a religious People. The Supreme Ruler of Events they have honoured with their Lips; and ſuch Honour will be accepted, provided it be paid in Sincerity, and attended with ſuitable Actions—without which it is no better than ſolemn Mockery, and will be conſidered as an Abomination. The peculiar Species of Religion which this Nation profeſſes, has been embraced by innumerable Americans; but they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that with them the Cauſe of this Religion deplorably ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, for want of proper Perſons to perform ſome of its moſt important Offices. The Relief ſo greatly wanted, it is in the Power of the Nation to give, without any Inconvenience to it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without any Injury to others. Dutiful and earneſt Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has been made to the national Governors in Behalf of this ſuffering Religion, for their charitable Aid; but they turn a deaf Ear to this Intreaty. Notwithſtanding their outward Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions, their <hi>ſolemn Thankſgiving,</hi> their pretended Zeal for God's Honour; they diſcover a Diſpoſition to <hi>do</hi> nothing in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of that Religion, which they eſteem to be <hi>beſt</hi> fitted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his Honour and Service. How abſurd is this Conduct!
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:011212_0105_0F862E17A3768978"/>How glaringly inconſiſtent is ſuch a Neglect with ſuch Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions!</p>
               <p>After endeavouring to impoſe upon the Public, by ſubſtituting a "legal Eſtabliſhment" of the Church in America, in the the Room of an <hi>American Epiſcopate,</hi> as it inſtead of, or toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with, the latter, the former had been requeſted, which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation, like many of his Aſſertions, is "abſolutely, utterly and intirely falſe" and <hi>abberratious;</hi> our <hi>Whig</hi> attempts to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit the Argument to which he <hi>is oppoſed,</hi> by ſaying it <q>would doubtleſs be as concluſive, in the Mouth of a Muſſelman, and in an Addreſs to the Grand Signior.</q> This ſagacious Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he afterwards ſagaciouſly repeats and expands, telling us that in Conſequence of this Doctrine, <q>in TURKEY the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver ſhould advance <hi>Mehometaniſm;</hi> in FRANCE, SPAIN, and PORTUGAL, <hi>Popery;</hi> in the BRITISH EMPIRE, <hi>Proteſtant Epiſcopacy;</hi> in China, <hi>Idolatry:</hi>
                  </q> And then cries out, <q>this is certainly moſt excellent Doctrine, from the Pen of a Church of England Divine, and a Doctor too.</q> In Anſwer to which I ſay, that the contrary to this, namely, that in TURKEY, FRANCE, SPAIN and PORTUGAL, and I may add, in the BRITISH EMPIRE as well as CHINA, Men ſhould not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to act according to the Dictates of their Conſciences, in religious Matters, <hi>is certainly moſt excellent Doctrine, from the Pen of an Advocate for Liberty, and one who thinks to ſignalize himſelf in its Cauſe too!</hi> This Writer, with all his Perverſneſs, muſt allow, that it is the Duty of all Men to promote the true Religion. Now if he can point out any other Way for Men to promote the true Religion, than by promoting what they <hi>eſteem</hi> to be the true Religio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He makes another Effort againſt the Doctor's Argument, by pretending that it will not ſtop, until it has introduced <q>the whole <hi>Anglican Hierarchy,</hi> with all its Pomp</q> &amp;c. and "eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed it over our Heads." But he has offered nothing in Support of this Pretence, but what will equally prove, that I ought not to give a poor Man a Shilling to receive his Neceſſity; becauſe if I give Way to his Plea ſo far, I cannot conſiſtently with hold my Hand, until I have raiſed him to a Level with <hi>Sqire Tickle</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>Beſides the deſpicable Sophiſtry and Miſrepreſentation that runs through this Paper of the <hi>American Whig,</hi> we meet with many obnoxious Things, for ſome of which even a common School-Boy would deſerve the Caſtigation of a WHIP. Thus
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:011212_0105_0F862E17A3768978"/>for Inſtance, he roundly aſſerts, that <q>prelatic Dominion in the Church, and arbitrary Rule in the State, have ever been inſeparable Companions.</q> If by <hi>prelatic Dominion</hi> he means any Thing elſe than <hi>epiſcopal Government,</hi> it is nothing to the Purpoſe. Now (not to ramble into the Hiſtories of other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) there never has been a Time ſince the Engliſh Nation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Chriſtian, as almoſt every Child knows, in which there has not been <hi>prelatic Dominion,</hi> in this Senſe of the Word:—excepting between the Year 1641 and 1660, when his beloved <hi>Preſbyterianiſm,</hi> and its Couſin-German <hi>Independency,</hi> in their Turns, uſurped the Dominion of Prelacy. But will he dare to ſay, that, in the Engliſh Nation, <hi>arbitrary Rule</hi> has always governed the State, unleſs in that bleſſed Period? What! Will he ſay this of our GEORGES, and of the immortal WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAM? On the other Hand, will he ſay that the Nation receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only <hi>Protection</hi> in their Liberties from his favourite OLIVER, without any Allay of deſpotic and <hi>arbitrary Rule?</hi> And yet unleſs he will ſay and can maintain all this, he ought to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed of his Aſſertion.</p>
               <p>It would be endleſs to call him to account for every Inſtance of his Miſbehaviour as a Writer; and it every Day becomes leſs neceſſary. The public are learning very faſt, not to be influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by his Prevarication and Sophiſtry; and, it is hoped, they will ſoon reſolve to admit no Aſſertions from ſo infected a Quarter, until they have performed a ſufficient <hi>Quarentine.</hi>

               <head type="sub">To the AMERICAN WHIG. Of the uninterrupted ſucceſſion.</head>
               <p>IF the clergy in the days of ignorance and ſuperſtition, when learning was at a very low ebb, the bible ſeldom read, and ſound reaſoning a thing unknown, ſtrenuouſly aſſerted, and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly contended for the abſolute neceſſity of an uninterrupted ſucceſſion of dioceſan biſhops, from the apoſtles, in order to render the goſpel miniſtry valid; this is not ſo much to be wondered at, and muſt be imputed to the badneſs of the times in which they liv'd, and the predominant attachment of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in thoſe times to religious triffles, and all the vain notions and unſcriptural opinions of the Popiſh hierarchy.</p>
               <p>But that Dr. Chandler, a proteſtant divine, in the preſent glorious age of the church, enlightened by all the happy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of the reformers, and the greateſt maſters of reaſon that ever exiſted, eminent on the account of their great learning, profound knowledge of ſcripture, accurate and extenſive acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, free and impartial enquiry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter truth, and remarkable candour and charity: That Dr. Chandler (I ſay) born and educated in ſo enlightened an age, ſhould patronize and plead for an old abſurd, Popiſh tenet, long ſince refuted and rejected by the ableſt advocates for truth in his own communion; is a conſideration that muſt ſurprize and grieve all, who are not under the influence of ſuperſtition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wiſh well to the Doctor's character as a divine, and a man of
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:011212_0106_0F862E1865DC6DB8"/>and deſire to promote the Proſperity of the proteſtant religion in general, to which this tenet is very unfavourable. For my own part, I really eſteem and regard the Dr. and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſe ſome of his opinions; becauſe I think they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of himſelf, inconſiſtent with truth, derogatory to the honour of the reformation, and moſt of the proteſtant churches, and tending to diſunite and raiſe ill blood among fellow prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants; at a time when the miniſters of Chriſt and the friends of liberty and mankind, ſhould unite their utmoſt efforts, to promote natural charity and a good underſtanding.</p>
               <p>But let us hear the Doctor, that we may be convinced of the uncharitableneſs of his tenet. After having premiſed that the church of England, holds a diſtinction of orders among the clergy, and that ſhe confines the right of ordaining to dioceſan biſhops; and after obſerving that none can have authority in the Chriſtian church, but thoſe who derive it from Chriſt, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mediately or immediately, he ſays, <q>Thoſe who receive it mediately muſt derive it from thoſe perſons whom Chriſt has authoriz'd to convey it; i. e. they muſt receive it by a regular ſucceſſion i. e. of dioceſan biſhop.</q> But may not a perſon receive authority in the Chriſtian church mediately, without that authority's being received by a regular ſucceſſion of dioceſans or preſbyters? A worthy and celebrated biſhop of the church of England, ſuppoſes, that in caſe of abſolute ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, a number of lay Chriſtians, have authority to ordain a man to the work of the miniſtry, inſinuating that after ſuch or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, he will be a lawful and valid miniſter of the goſpel. See Burnet's expoſition of the 23d article.</p>
               <p>Dr. Chandler, by his regular ſucceſſion, means a regular ſucceſſion of dioceſan biſhops. Yet, why, if an uninterrupted ſucceſſion was abſolutely neceſſary, to convey authority in the church, ſuch a ſucceſſion of preſbyters might not confer that authority, as well as biſhops, I preſume could not eaſily be proved.</p>
               <p>If any ſtreſs was to be laid upon an uninterrupted ſucceſſion of miniſters, the preſbyterians are on the ſureſt ſide; becauſe the ſucceſſion of preſbyters is much more probable than that of dioceſan biſhops.</p>
               <p>Preſbyters in the church of England, may and do perform the moſt eſſential parts of the miniſtry; they preach, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the ſacrament, receive into communion, excommunicate, abſolve, &amp;c. Now gentle reader! let me aſk, is the conferring authority to preach, an higher act, of a higher nature and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, than all the abovementioned acts united? And can any ſolid reaſon be aſſigned, why he who performs thoſe, may not perform that? Is the conveying any dignity (ſuppoſe the regal)
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:011212_0107_0F862E1933D3C6C8"/>more important than the dignity itſelf and the exerciſe of it? Rather is it not leſs noble? And with theſe Sentiments in thy mind, impartial reader! is not the diſpute, whether preſbyters have a right to ordain preſbyters on the ſide of the epiſcopali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, a very triffling and ſilly controverſy?</p>
               <p>One would imagine, from Dr. Chandler's ſtrenuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement of the right of ordination to a dioceſan biſhop, that a dioceſan biſhop was able to convey every miniſterial accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment by the impoſition of his hand, and his epiſcopal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction.</p>
               <p>But is this really the caſe! can a biſhop's hand and act, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey learning, piety, knowledge, grace, holineſs and other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites to the miniſtry? Far from it. Thoſe ordained by the preſbytery are not in theſe reſpects inferior to thoſe ordained by the biſhop.</p>
               <p>Do the biſhops ordain fitter perſons, and more virtuous and holy men to the miniſtry, than preſbyters ordain, or do they take more care to keep bad men out of the miniſtry? Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence doth not prove this. Are the biſhops better men, more orthodox in the faith, more holy in their lives, and more inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatigable in their miniſtry than the preſbyters? I believe not.—Let it be recorded, to the diſhonour, the eternal diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of biſhops, that one of the moſt apoſtolic men now in the world, the moſt powerful, eloquent, zealous, indefatigable, ſucceſsful, devout, practical preacher, that perhaps ever lived, the grand ornament of the church of England, would have had a period put to his uſeful and edifying miniſtry, and poſſibly to his precious life too, if biſhops could have treated him as they deſired.—This ſame ſeraphic, and divine preacher, tho' rejected by his own biſhops, diſowned and denied their pulpits by the generality of his epiſcopal brethren, yet is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with open arms, by the preſbyterian miniſters and people.</p>
               <p>Theſe things may be thought foreign to the argument, but I for my part, muſt declare, that where I find the clergy zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for God's glory and the good of ſouls, eager in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of holy men, indefatigable in the diſcharge of their office, exemplary in their lives, ſucceſsful in gaining ſubjects to Chriſt, and in making their fellow men wiſer and better, ſtrict in their diſcipline, cautious in admitting into the miniſtry, and ſevere in puniſhing the unworthy.</p>
               <p>I look upon it, that ſuch men muſt be lawful miniſters of Chriſt, and inveſted with authority from him, the above cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtics I eſteem, (and St. Ambroſe and Gregory Nazianzen are of my opinion) much more ſubſtantial proofs of the validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:011212_0107_0F862E1933D3C6C8"/>of their miniſtry, than their ordination by a biſhop in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted ſucceſſion, would be, if they could fully prove it. And with regard to ſuch proofs as theſe, the preſbyterian mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters have as many of them, and thoſe as ſtrong as the epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians.</p>
               <p>I think the beſt ſeals of a man's miniſtry, are the ſouls that he is inſtrumental in ſaving, and in turning from darkneſs to light, from ſin and vice, to virtue and holineſs, and from the power of Satan unto God. Let theſe be the proofs of one's miniſtry, and he need not envy any other, the privilege of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination by a biſhop; No, nor the dignity and revenues of a biſhoprick itſelf.</p>
               <p>I believe that Jeſus Chriſt, gives in the preſent age his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of a goſpel miniſter, and authenticates, and adds a ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his miniſtry, by the ſupernatural influences of the Holy Ghoſt, which accompanies and renders ſuch a miniſtry ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the ſalvation of men, and this approbation and ſanction, the non-conformiſts have as abundantly as the epiſcopalians.</p>
               <p>But leſt I ſhould be thought to declaim, and not to argue, I ſhould now proceed to diſcuſs more particuliarly the opinion of an uninterrupted ſucceſſion, of dioceſan biſhops, from the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and the neceſſity of ordination in ſuch a ſucceſſion.</p>
               <p>I obſerve firſt, that if the validity of the Chriſtian miniſtry, was to depend upon ſuch an unbroken line of biſhops, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that Chriſt or his apoſtles, would have directed every church to keep in its hands an authentic regiſter of its biſhops, and their legal conſecration. When under the law the high prieſt's office was entail'd upon the Aaronical family; God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that a regiſter, ſhould be kept of the deſcendants of Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, that ſo the right to the prieſthood might appear. Now to reaſon by analogy and <hi>a for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iori,</hi> it is probable, that if a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſucceſſion of miniſters, had been as important and neceſſary in the Chriſtian church, as it was in the Jewiſh, God would have made the ſame proviſion for the one, which he made for, the other; yet ſuch proviſion has not been made, but on the contrary, the apoſtle Paul in his epiſtle to Titus, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions him, not to give heed to Jewiſh fables, and to avoid fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh queſtions and genealogies; and ſurely if any thing is a fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh queſtion, it is this, have I been ordain'd by a biſhop in an uninterrupted ſucceſſion? if ever there was any thing like a Jewiſh fable, and an endleſs and vain genealogy, it is this ſame uninterrupted ſucceſſion; a man may pore all his life time on the records of paſt ages, and yet never come to any ſatisfaction about every individual and proper link in the unbroken chain.</p>
               <p>This argument will be ſtrengthened if we conſider what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:011212_0108_0F862E19E2BC8C30"/>and almoſt endleſs catalogues of biſhops there muſt have been, if each church had kept a catalogue of its biſhops from the apoſtles; and what a tedious, endleſs, and next to impoſſible taſk it would have been to examine thoſe records: the bare mentioning of the thing ſhews its abſurdity, and its abſurdity proves it could not be conſiſtent with divine wiſdom.—It was comparatively an eaſy matter to preſerve the genealogies of a few families in one nation, for a few centuries under the law: But how difficult would it have been, to have kept a catalogue of all the Chriſtian biſhops in every nation, for many centuries under the goſpel? the former was kept up by a divine revelation and a ſupernatural interpoſition; the latter could not be any otherwiſe preſerved. But who will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the neceſſity of a divine continual revelation, ſince the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred canon has been cloſed, or ſince the days of the apoſtles. There are therefore, no authentic catalogues of all the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian biſhops ſince the apoſtles, now extant.</p>
               <p>This argument will be farther corroborated, if we conſider how much the apoſtles inveigh'd againſt the ceremonies, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities and minute obſervances of the Moſaic oeconomy, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the ſcrupulous regard and obſervation of the profeſſors of the goſpel, whoſe ſimplicity and freedom, from beggarly elements, they ſo often celebrated and diſplay'd. Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials in religion are in low eſteem with the apoſtles. Eſſentials, faith, hope, charity and holineſs, are with them of principal conſideration.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I obſerve, 2dly that if the uninterrupted ſucceſſion is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, in order to render a goſpel miniſtry valid, then there can be no valid miniſtry in moſt of the proteſtant churches; then the Waldenſes and Albigenſes, thoſe faithful witneſſes and illuſtrious ſufferers for the truth, had no lawful miniſters; then the Church of Holland, Geneva and Scotland, the proteſtants in France and Germany, and the diſſenters in England, Ireland and America, are deſtitute of legal paſtors. But can a tenet, from which ſuch conſequences flow, and which reflects ſo much diſhonour on the generality of proteſtants, and is ſo favourable to popery, be rational and true. Charity, virtue and common ſenſe forbid the thought. I dare aſſert, that upon Dr. Chandler's principles, the lawfulneſs and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the reformation cannot be maintained, and therefore, I do not wonder that ſome high churchmen declare, "Better be a papiſt than a preſbyterian."—Or that they would ſooner receive for their paſtor, a Romiſh prieſt, who had liv'd in er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and vice, and been actually guilty of continued fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:011212_0108_0F862E19E2BC8C30"/>than the moſt orthodox and virtuous, the moſt able and powerful non-epiſcopal miniſter in the world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I obſerve, that this tenet ſeems inconſiſtent with the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſe of Chriſt, to his church, of being ever preſent with it, and providing for its perpetual ſubſiſtence; for if its ſubſiſtence depends on this uninterrupted ſucceſſion; then if the uninterrupted ſucceſſion cannot be proved (as we poſitively aſſert and defy the Dr. to prove the contrary) then neither can the preſence of Chriſt with the church, and its regular ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence be proved. But the church doth ſubſiſt regularly, and Chriſt is preſent with it, in places where dioceſan biſhops have no authority; therefore the preſence of Chirſt, the ſubſiſtence of the church, and the regular adminiſtration of ordinances, cannot depend on an uninterrupted ſucceſſion. Dr. Chandler aſſerts, in the appeal, that if it could be made clear, that the ſucceſſion had been interrupted, it would alſo prove farther, that Chriſt had neglected to provide for his church, in a caſe ſo eſſential to the being of it. O incredible weakneſs and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition! This indeed is playing puſhpin and crambo with a witneſs. I thus reply to it, Chriſt's church has a being, and he is preſent with it in places where miniſters are not ordain'd, in virtue of an uninterrupted ſucceſſion; therefore the uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſucceſſion is not eſſential to the being of it. I leave it to the candid reader, to determine, whoſe reaſoning is moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive, the Doctor's or mine; he argues from a ſucceſſion, which he cannot prove; I argue from the actual exiſtence of the Chriſtian church, and Chriſt's gracious preſence with it, in places where no uninterrupted ſucceſſion is pleaded for, which I can prove, and which I look upon as an unanſwerable argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the ſucceſſion is not eſſential to the being of Chriſt's church. It is not to be ſuppos'd, that Jeſus Chriſt, in whom are hid all the treaſures of wiſdom, knowledge and benevolence, would have made the actual exiſtence of his church to depend upon a fact that cannot be proved, and concerning which, no man alive can obtain proper ſatisfaction, or that he would have ſuſpended the validity, of the Chriſtian miniſtry, on a ſucceſſion, at beſt uncertain, and which I think I can prove to have been broken.</p>
               <p n="4">4. I obſerve, that ſeveral of the moſt eminent biſhops, of the church of England, have diſavowed, this uninterrupted ſucceſſion; which is in my opinion, a very ſtrong argument againſt it, as their intereſt lay the contrary way. Nothing but the force of truth, and the conviction of their own conſcience, could have led them to give up the cauſe of an uninterrupted ſucceſſion of dioceſan biſhops. I have already mentioned the
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:011212_0109_0F862E1C451B4BF8"/>opinion of biſhop Burnet, and many other eminent divines of the church of England, who allowed that in the beginning of Chriſtianity, biſhops and prieſts were the ſame, I ſhall add to theſe, the teſtimony of biſhop Hoadly, a profeſt advocate for dioceſan epiſcopacy. <q>It is highly abſurd (ſays he) to put ſo important a point as God's favour and eternal happineſs upon what no man living can ever be acquainted with to his ſatisfaction. But it is ſtill more abſurd, to put it upon a matter, the contrary to which appears to be true. This is the caſe here. This regular uninterrupted ſucceſſion of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, qualify'd and regularly ordained, is a matter impoſſible to be proved; nay, the contrary is more than probable upon all hiſtorical evidence, which we receive in other caſes. (he ſays alſo) It hath not pleaſed God, in his providence, to keep up any proof of the leaſt probability or moral poſſibility of a regular uninterrupted ſucceſſion: But there is a great appearance, and humanly ſpeaking, a certainty to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; "that this ſucceſſion hath been often interrupted.

The Author has ſhewed the Futility of the American Whig's chief Argument againſt an American Epiſcopate— an Argument, for which no Diſſenter who ſees into its Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, will thank him. This worthy Gentleman is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive that the Whig's Writings will have a Tendency to bring the Clergy into Contempt. I am totally of another O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion. I firmly believe there is not a Man of Senſe or Virtue who will not eſteem the Clergy the more for his Abuſe. The Whig and his Deſigns are now too well known to do any Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief that Way. Beſides, he only ecchoes the hackneyed Jargon of Tindal, Collins, and others of the ſame Tribe. My ingenious Correſpondent thinks I am reprehenſible for my 'Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminations againſt Diſſenters." But I beg he will reflect on the Provocation which I, as a Member of the CHURCH of ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND, have received. How cruelly, how ungenerouſly has that CHURCH been treated! I began not this Controverſy; nor ſhall I continue it longer than the American Whig is pleaſed to make it neceſſary. And he may be aſſured, that if the Whig ſhould continue his Attack as long—nay, thrice the Space that <hi>Troy</hi> ſtood out againſt the <hi>Greeks:</hi> So long will the Whip be held over him, and he chaſtiſed for his Miſbehaviour. I ſhall only add, that I have no Controverſy with ſuch Diſſenters as my Correſpondent, who are willing that others ſhould enjoy the ſame Privileges with themſelves; and that I ſhall be much obliged to this Gentleman, if he will be ſo kind as to leave his Addreſs with my Printer.</p>

               <p>The following Piece was written with a View to ſet the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument reſpecting an American Biſhop, in what I conceive to be its true Point of Light. The Author claims at leaſt the Merit of it's having been dictated by Impartiality, and has therefore choſe to reaſon upon Principles common both to Churchmen and Diſſenters. As the Argument is deſigned upon theſe Principles to ſhew the preſent Clamour of his <hi>BRETHREN,</hi> the Diſſenters to be groundleſs, he hopes the <hi>American Whig</hi> will excuſe him for emphatically expreſſing ſuch his Deſign in the Scriptural Motto prefixed to this Paper. The Author moreover profeſſes himſelf to be a Friend to civil and religious Liberty, in it's moſt extenſive Senſe; and if you, Sir, can bear with his Freedom, and think his Sentiments worthy of Notice, you will by publiſhing them, oblige him.</p>

               <p>THE Diſpute concerning the Introduction of an <hi>American Epiſcopate</hi> has unhappily formed two grand Parties.— Churchmen who maintain the Cauſe on one Hand, and the Diſſenters who oppoſe it on the other, have become ſo warmed with the Subject, that I am afraid they are both chargeable with having departed from that Delicacy and Politeneſs which ought to be preſerved in every Debate. The <hi>American Whig</hi> has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently indulged his Pen in caſting Reproach upon the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> and its Clergy; and tho' I have a better Opinion of his Candour than to ſuppoſe he aimed at every Particular Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gymen of that Church, yet his Expreſſions are thrown out with an Air and Appearance ſo general, that every Reader cannot diſcern ſo much Charity as would even ſhelter under its benign Protection, any one of thoſe Clergymen, from the malignant Blaſts of his illiberal and indiſcriminate Cenſures.</p>
               <p>It is well known, that the ſerious and religious Part of a Community, will entertain a Regard and Veneration for their Clergy; and thoſe of them who faithfully diſcharge their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Truſt, are truly worthy of the Eſteem they generally meet with. Hence it is, that whatever looks like an undiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed

To what Cauſe this is to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed can be of little Importance here to enquire into; 'tis ſufficient that there is in human Nature, a Principle that leads to this Diſpoſition, and it ſerves in ſome Meaſure to account for the Heat with which <hi>this</hi> Controverſy has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted.</p>
               <p>Some indeed think, that if the Clergy were brought into Contempt, it would have a very unfavourable Influence upon Religion itſelf, and I confeſs it is an Opinion that does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be ill founded.

                  </gap> Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to theſe Conſequences.</p>
               <p>After having thus reproved the <hi>American Whig,</hi> will you Mr. <hi>Tickle,</hi> permit me to treat you with equal Plainneſs and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? Pray, Sir, has not your Paper too much abounded in Recriminations againſt Diſſenters? Has not your Zeal ſometimes tranſported you beyond the Bounds of Moderation? I am afraid it has; and ſo far you muſt alſo, acknowledge yourſelf to be reprehenſible. Pity it is, that more Temper and Decency had not been obſerved on both Sides!</p>
               <p>Give me Leave now, Sir, to tell you that I myſelf am a <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenter,</hi> but upon ſuch Principles of Catholiciſm and Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence as have hitherto, and I hope ever will make me over look the narrow Confines of Party-Spirit and Bigotry; while I view and regard the whole Chriſtian Church (however ſplit into different Denominations) as <hi>one Fold, under one Shepherd.</hi> It
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:011212_0112_0F862E1F241DF8C0"/>is obſervable in this Diſpute, with what Greedineſs of Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation each Party commends and applauds whatever is written in its own Favour; while with equal Diſguſt and Deteſtation they reject the Sentiments offered on the other Side of the Queſtion. Thus it is that Truth gets entirely out of Sight; and yields the Prize to blind Prejudice and Party-Zeal.</p>
               <p>I have been amazed that upon this Subject, which is thought to affect <hi>American</hi> Liberty, and in which the grand Argument againſt an <hi>Epiſcopate</hi> in <hi>America</hi> is, <q>that he muſt neceſſarily be inveſted with the temporal Powers which Biſhops have in <hi>England,</hi>
                  </q> the leading and capital Circumſtance of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>'s not being eſtabliſhed in the Colonies, ſhould have been ſo little attended to.</p>
               <p>For my Part, as a Diſſenter, I hold the Opinion, that there is no ſuch Eſtabliſhment by Law in the Colonies. This I know to be the general Opinion of Diſſenters, and indeed of the moſt ſenſible Churchmen too: Nor have I Reaſon to doubt, that the <hi>American Whig</hi> himſelf, is well ſatisfied as to this Point. It was ſo clearly proved in a Courſe of Papers publiſhed ſome Years ago by the <hi>Independent Reflector,</hi> that I have never ſince had the leaſt Difficulty about it. He ſhewed, to a Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that neither the Common nor Statute Law could effect ſuch Eſtabliſhment; and that in this Country, we might glory in the free and equal Participation of religious Privileges; and in the undiſturbed Exerciſe of all the ſacred Rights of Conſcience. Happy are the People that are in ſuch a Caſe! —May we and our Poſterity for ever remain thus ſecure in theſe our ineſtimable Rights and Privileges; nor, while the Sun and Moon endure, behold the Standard of eccleſiaſtical Tyranny erected in this goodly Heritage, this Aſſylum of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty which we poſſeſs.</p>
               <p>It being once taken for granted, (and ſurely the <hi>American Whig</hi> will not deny it) that there is no Eſtabliſhment of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> in the Colonies; does it not furniſh a ſolid Principle for determining the preſent Controverſy? May not the Waſte of Argument and Declamation that have been uſed upon this Subject, be drawn, as it were, into one Point, and teſted by the Principle here advanced?—<hi>Here,</hi> as in a Sanctuary, I think the Diſſenters may take Refuge, and calm all their Fears. <hi>This</hi> muſt effectually ſecure them againſt the ſo much dreadful Chains of Epiſcopal Dominion: And thus ſecured, does it not become their Duty to huſh the Storm they have raiſed; put an End to the Paper War they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and leave the <hi>Church</hi> they have attacked, at Peace?
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:011212_0112_0F862E1F241DF8C0"/>The Method of Reaſoning by which I ſatisfy myſelf upon the Point is this. If there be no epiſcopal Eſtabliſhment in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, then the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> here, as having Relation to the State, can no more be known in Law than any of our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Churches: It muſt be as abſolutely free from all legal Modifications as they are None of the Laws relating to the <hi>Church of England</hi> as a national Eſtabliſhment, can have Refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to that Church where it is not eſtabliſhed; if then the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> as it exiſts in <hi>America,</hi> is not legally eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, it follows that all the Laws relative to, and founded on that Eſtabliſhment in <hi>England,</hi> when conſidered with regard to the Colonies, are without an Object to which they can be directed, and conſequently become a meer dead Letter. Whence then is the Force and Operation of thoſe Laws to be derived on this Side the Atlantic?</p>
               <p>The <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> being thus deſtitute at preſent of all legal Eſtabliſhment, neither has or claims any ſecular or eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Powers, beyond Diſſenters. Her Government and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline are indeed ſimilar to that of the eſtabliſhed <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and hence ſhe diſtinguiſhes herſelf by that Name, as the Parent Church out of whoſe Boſom ſhe emerged.</p>
               <p>The Queſtion then might be aſked, what it is that can raiſe the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> here, out of its preſent State, into all that Splendour and Dignity which ſome Diſſenters ſeem to be ſo much afraid of? In ſhort, what is it that could give her a legal Exiſtence? Would a Biſhop's ſetting his Foot in this Country do it, or would it not require Acts of our own Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to accompliſh this <hi>new Creation?</hi> I call it a <hi>Creation,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> in Suppoſition of Law, may be ſaid now <hi>not to be;</hi> ſo that Power by which it is brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to being, muſt be a Power creating it; and I truſt we have no Reaſon to fear, that a Legiſlative <hi>Fiat</hi> will ever bring this Event to paſs.</p>
               <p>Is it not rather a haſty Concluſion, to infer that a Biſhop's Preſence would have ſuch a magic Force and ſupernatural Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſy as to raiſe the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi> from Nonentity? To build up an Eſtabliſhment without Materials, and to ſet all the various Wheels of her Eccleſiaſtical and Political Machinery at work? It ſeems to me dangerous to advance ſuch a Doctrine; for I believe, if a Biſhop ſhould come, we ſhall one and all deny the Principle upon which the Doctrine is founded. At this Rate, ſhould a Biſhop go into <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>Geneva,</hi> why might not Epiſcopacy be eſtabliſhed there?—Nay, a few ite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <head>From Mr. PARKER'S GAZETTE, Oct. 17, 1768. The American Whig, No. XXXII.</head>
               <head type="sub">Continuation of the letter, on the uninterrupted ſucceſſion.</head>
               <p>THOSE are the trueſt miniſters of Chriſt, who muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble their bleſſed maſter in the temper of their minds and their outward behaviour. As the apoſtle aſſures us, that the genuine children of Abraham, are not always his natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deſcendants; but thoſe who imitate his faith; ſo I believe that thoſe are the genuine miniſters of Chriſt, not meerly, who are ordained by epiſcopal hands, (for if this were ſo, the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Satan might be the miniſters of Chriſt) but thoſe who are moſt like their lord and maſter.</p>
               <p>I mean not, however, to deny the propriety of goſpel mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters being ordained to their office by the clergy, becauſe the clergy are generally beſt capable of judging of a candidate's qualification for the miniſtry; and ſolemnly ſetting him apart to his office, being alſo thereunto appointed by Chriſt; and therefore, I think it irregular, very irregular, to preach without ordination, or to receive a lay ordination, where an ordination by preſbyters is to be obtained.</p>
               <p>Yet I do not think, that Jeſus Chriſt, has confin'd the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to ordain to the miniſtry, intirely to the clergy; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he has authorized the laity in caſes of abſolute neceſſity, to ſet apart men, or to ordain them to the goſpel miniſtry; and if Dr. Chandler, attends to this ſentiment, for which I can give good reaſon; he will find, that it will fully anſwer all his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:011212_0113_0F862E24DDFA35A8"/>in the 4th page of his Appeal, and whatever elſe the epiſcopalians have advanced on this ſubject.</p>
               <p>But to return to the uninterrupted ſucceſſion, I think it is very weak in Dr. Chandler, to declare, that "for any one to ſay, that ſuch a ſucceſſion cannot be proved, (I ſuppoſe he means when nobody can confute the aſſertion, as is the caſe here) is not ſufficient," But I am ſure that a propoſition deſtitute and incapable of proof, ought not to be made an article of faith, and poſitively aſſerted as an undoubted truth; and I am alſo ſure, that to aſſert, that the uninterrupted ſucceſſion cannot be proved, if ſuch an aſſertion cannot be confuted, is altogether ſufficient and very much to the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The Dr. ſays, it is incumbent on the objectors, to prove, that the ſucceſſion by which he and his brethren hold, has been broken. But I aſk the Doctor's pardon, for differing in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from him on this point.</p>
               <p>As we, the objectors, are ſatisfy'd with the validity of our ordinations, and have no doubts on the head, with reference to the uninterrupted ſucceſſion; why ſhould we perplex our brains in endeavouring to prove it unbroken? But as the Doctor and his Brethren, lay ſo great a ſtreſs and build the validity of their miniſtry upon it, I think it highly incumbent upon them, to prove it unbroken. In all other caſes of a ſimilar nature, ſuch evidence is required as eſſentially neceſſary. When a man pretend a right by ſucceſſion or deſcent, to any eſtate, dignity, freehold or poſſeſſion, he is obliged to prove, if his right is conteſted, every link of the ſucceſſion or deſcent by which he pretends to hold.</p>
               <p>For inſtance, if G. pretends to be the lawful ſon of F. the lawful ſon of E. the lawful ſon of D the lawful ſon of C. the lawful ſon of B. the lawful ſon of A; and if G. pretends a right to a certain tract of land, as the lawful deſcendant of A. in caſe G's right is diſputed; it is evident, in order to make it good, he muſt not only prove his own legal deſcent from F. but the legal birth of all his intermediate anceſtors and their lawful deſcent from A. Thus alſo Dr. Chandler, upon his own principles, as he founds his right to the Chriſtian miniſtry, upon authority receiv'd from an uninterrupted ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of dioceſan biſhops, ought to ſatisfy us, that every biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op in the line of whom he received ordination, was legally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated</p>
               <p>The Doctor ſays, it is not ſufficient for any one to ſay, that ſuch a ſucceſſion cannot be proved. But the following inſtance will illuſtrate that point: The preſent King of France, has a right to his crown, becauſe he is the great grandſon of Lewis
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:011212_0114_0F862E2686025480"/>XIV. and was at his death the only ſurviving male in the eld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt male line: As this was the caſe, his right to the crown was clear, and he was able to prove it by the genealogy of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and every proper evidence; and if any other French Prince, had pretended a right to the crown of France, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the ſame lineal deſcent, I believe it would have been rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned quite ſufficient to have told ſuch an one he could not prove ſuch a deſcent.</p>
               <p>If Dr. Chandler has a right to preach the goſpel, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was ordained by a biſhop, ordain'd by a biſhop and ſo on, in an unbroken line up to an apoſtle; I am ſure he cannot prove ſuch a right upon ſuch principles, unleſs he can prove at the ſame time, the unbroken line; his right to preach in ſuch a caſe, ſuppoſing he cannot prove the uninterrupted ſucceſſion, can be at beſt founded only on conjecture; a very improbable conjecture too, as the reader will find by the following con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</p>
               <p>Euſebius, the moſt ancient eccleſiaſtical hiſtorian, from whom ſucceeding writers have made their catalogues of biſhops; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, that it was no eaſy matter to tell who ſucceeded the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in the government of the churches, excepting ſuch as may be collected from St. Paul's own words. Mr. Lewis, a clergyman of the church of England, thus expreſſes himſelf, in a Letter to Dr. Kennet, <q>You know, ſir, biſhop Pearſon, has ſhewn that Euſebius's account is very diſturbed and confus'd; St. Peter is ſet down as the firſt biſhop of Rome, and yet it is a thing very diſputable, whether St. Peter ever was at Rome.—Linus is reckoned as his immediate ſucceſſor; and biſhop Pearſon, has ſhewn that St. Peter died after Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus; Cletus, Clement and Anacletus are reckoned next; and yet biſhop Pearſon has made it probable at leaſt, that Cletus and Anecletus are both the ſame perſon.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dupin juſtly obſerves, <q>according to the common received opinion, to St. Peter ſucceeded St. Linus, to St. Linus, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacletus or Cletus, and to him St. Clement; this order is obſerved by St. Ireneus, Euſebius, St. Jerome, and in the ancient catalogues of the Popes; but Optatus, Ruſinus, St. Auguſtin and ſome other Latin authors, ſubſtitute St. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment immediately to St. Linus, and place Anacletus in the third rank, ſome diſtinguiſh Cletus from Anacletus.</q> Thus we ſee the ancients differed about the ſucceſſion, nay, the very exiſtence of ſome of the firſt biſhops of Rome, the moſt celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted church in the world, and which has taken the moſt pains to preſerve a catalogue of her biſhops.</p>

As Dr. Chandler pretends to have received authority in a line of dioceſans from an apoſtle; and as I imagine he includes in the firſt part of his line; the biſhop of the church of Rome. I ſuppoſe as he lays a very great and undue ſtreſs upon ancient and eccleſiaſtical hiſtory; he looks upon St. Peter as the firſt biſhop of Rome, or at leaſt the apoſtle who conſecrated that firſt biſhop from whom he derives his authority: But I will lay before him, Monſieur Abbadie's reaſoning from God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible word, which I think fully proves that St. Peter was never at Rome.</p>
               <p>The ſcripture expreſly informs us, that in the diviſion which the apoſtles made of the departments of the goſpel miniſtry; St. Peter, with St. James and St. John, had a commiſſion to preach J. C. to the Jews, and St. Paul, that of evangelizing to the Gentiles; when they ſaw (ſays Paul, Gal. 2.) that the goſpel of the uncircumciſion was committed unto me, as the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was unto Peter, (for he that wrought effectually in Peter, to the apoſtleſhip of the circumciſion, the ſame was mighty in me towards the Gentiles; and when James, Cephas and John, who ſeem'd to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given unto me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowſhip, that we ſhould go unto the Heathen, and they unto the circumciſion. According to this regulation, St. Paul, immediately preaches the goſpel in Greece, in Illyrium, in Italy and at Rome the capital of nations, but he makes no ſtay in Judea, nor in the neighbouring country; and when he would paſs into Bethinia, he was prevented in his deſign, by the ſpirit of Chriſt, who ſends him into Macedonia; he indeed travels to Jeruſalem, but it was to carry collections for the poor, and not to eſtabliſh his ſee. St. Peter, with St. John and St. James, turns his ſteps another way. He preaches to his countrymen in Judea and at Babylon, or in the provinces con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous to it, to the Jews of the diſperſion; but neither he, nor his colleagues make their appearance i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the weſt: St. Paul in his different travels, doth not meet them, he doth not ſalute them, in his epiſtle ſo full of ſalutations, addreſſed to all ſorts of perſons: Timothy, Titus, Silas, &amp;c. aſſiſt him in his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and he doth all in concert with them, even to the placing their names with his at the beginning of his epiſtles. But no interview between St. Peter and St. Paul: no letters received or written in common, by thoſe two apoſtle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> no meſſage from the one to the other, no correſpondence by word of mouth, or by writing, which are ſo common, and even ſo neceſſary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween colleagues who are not very diſtant from each other; the apoſtles did not forget their principal calling. St. Paul went to Jeruſalem, but not to fix his ſee there, for he was the
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:011212_0115_0F862E27D6B297B8"/>apoſtle of the Gentiles; and if Peter ſhould have come to Rome, as ſome will have it, it could not be to eſtabliſh his ſee there, for he was the apoſtle of the Jews; but the voyage which it is ſaid Peter made to the weſt, has all the air of a fable.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The apoſtles knew nothing of it, or which amounts to the ſame thing, have told us nothing of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. St. Clement, biſhop of Rome, ſucceſſor of St. Peter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out knowing it, was no doubt ignorant of this voyage, inaſmuch as he makes no mention of it, whilſt he deſcribes the travels and labour of the apoſtles, and particularly the courſes of St. Paul, in the different parts of the world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. St. Luke, who leaves St. Paul at Rome, under the reign of Nero, has forgot to tell us, that St. Peter had been in that capital of the world, and that he had been made biſhop of it, from the reign of Claudius.</p>
               <p n="4">4. St. Paul arriving at Rome, finds that the ſynagogue there, had ſcarce heard any thing ſaid of Jeſus Chriſt, and that they knew nothing with regard to Chriſtianity, but that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were every where ſpoken againſt. And nevertheleſs St. Peter had then been a long time amongſt them, according to the Legendary writers, and of the twenty five years of which his pontificate is made to conſiſt, two thirds of it, at leaſt muſt have been by this time elapſed.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Books of the New-Teſtament, beſides ſaying truth, contain a thouſand things which have not an eſſential relation to our ſalvation; and yet upon the ſuppoſition of the church of Rome, an eſſential and fundamental fact is here forgotton, which in placing the corner ſtone in its place, ſuſtains the divine edifice of religion. Was it then more neceſſary, to be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the ſhip which carried Paul, had for a ſign Caſtor and Pollux, than to know that Peter was biſhop of Rome.</p>
               <p>I think this reaſoning overturns the foundation of popery, and proves that Dr. Chandler and his brethren, have not received their authority from Peter; as they imagine. It alſo proves, that one ſuppoſed chain of ſucceſſion has been miſtaken, and that thoſe eccleſiaſtical writers, on whom ſo much ſtreſs is laid, have contradicted ſcripture, and publiſhed falſhoods, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſerve but little credit.</p>
               <p>We have ſeen that the links of the chain of Roman biſhops have been miſtaken. Let us reflect a little upon what the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents ſay of the ſucceſſion in the church of Alexandria, which was alſo a very famous church.</p>
               <p>Eutychius, patriarch of Alexandria, relates, that St. Mark in eſtabliſhing Annanias patriarch of that ſame chuch of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, eſtabliſhed with him twelve preſbyters, to the end, that
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:011212_0115_0F862E27D6B297B8"/>when the ſee ſhould become vacant, they ſhould fill it with one of their number, and that the remaining eleven, ſhould lay their hands upon him, bleſs him, and create him patriarch; and ſhould ſtraightway chooſe another man, and eſtabliſh him preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, in the ſtead of him who had been made patriarch; and that by this means, the number of twelve ſhould be always complete. And the author of the queſtions upon the Old and New-Teſtament, ſays, that this cuſtom prevail'd throughout all Egypt, whilſt it had no biſhop. By this fragment of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent hiſtory, we ſee that the line of ſucceſſion in the Alexandrian church, ran at firſt, through a number of preſbyters, and not dioceſan biſhops; which diſproves Dr. Chandler's notion of the uninterrupted ſucceſſion. The intelligent reader will obſerve, that the patriarch was conſecrated by his eleven fellow preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and that they eſtabliſhed another preſbyter in the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch's ſtead. St Jerome ſays, that at Alexandria, ſince St. Mark the evangeliſt, until the biſhops Hieracles and Denis, the preſbyters took always one of their number, whom they plac'd in a more elevated ſtation, and called him biſhop, and it is very probable, that preſbyters ordain'd the firſt biſhops of Gaul.</p>
               <p>Dr. Doddridge, in his lectures juſtly obſerves, that conteſted elections, in almoſt all conſiderable cities, make it very dubious which were the true biſhops and decrees of councils rendering all thoſe ordinations null, where any Simoniacal contract was the foundation of them, makes it impoſſible to prove, at leaſt on the principles of the Romiſh church; (and I may add Dr. Chandler's) that there is now upon earth, any one perſon who is a legal ſucceſſor of the apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jones, (continues the Dr.) has undertaken to prove at large, that the ordination of our Engliſh biſhops, cannot be traced up to the church of Rome, as its original; that in the year 668, the ſucceſſors of Auſtin the monk (who came over in 596) being almoſt extinct, by far the greateſt part of the biſhops were of Scotiſh ordination, by Aidan and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>inan, who came out of the Culdee Monaſtry of Columbanus, and were no more than preſbyters. So that denying the validity of preſbyterian ordination, ſhakes the foundation of the epiſcopal church of England.</p>
               <p>I ſhall conclude this paper, with the animated and ſenſible words of Mr. Boyſe, on this ſubject. Speaking of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ordination by dioceſan biſhops, and of the uninterrupted ſucceſſion, he ſays, We ſhould not indeed wonder, to hear ſuch ſenſeleſs notions as theſe, advanc'd by the furious parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <p>But that pretended proteſtants ſhould lick up the poiſonous ſpittle of thoſe popiſh writers, and throw it in the face of ſo many of the moſt eminent teachers, that the reformed churches were ever bleſſed with, argues a ſtrange degree of judicial infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation; that they ſhould allow the validity of the miſſion of the popiſh prieſts, who are given up to ſo manifold and perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious deluſions, who are ſet apart by their ordinations, to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate an idolatrous maſs; and that they ſhould at the ſame time deny the validity of the miſſion of all thoſe eminent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors of the reformed churches who have been ſet apart to their office (as Timothy was to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Nay, tho' they have been ordain'd by ſuch paſtors of particular churches as were in the ſtile of the three firſt centuries biſhops; and this after a due and precious trial of their miniſterial abilities, and unblameable converſation.

This opinion can be look'd upon, no other than the worſt character, a piece of phariſaiſm all over, that ſtrains at a gnat, and ſwallows a camel; and I can not avoid having at leaſt a contempt of thoſe thoughts, and compaſſion for their authors.</p>

               <p>MY laſt Letter contained a Refutation of the weak Sophiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſed by the <hi>Whig</hi> and his Confederates, with Regard to the Caſe of Ordination.—A Caſe hard beyond Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; eſpecially if we conſider the unimpeached Loyalty of the Perſons who ſuffer, and the known Principles of thoſe to whom that Suffering may by ſome be attributed. The Sufferers have upon all Occaſions, manifeſted their Attachment to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, with which their own Intereſts are intimately connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by maintaining as far as lay in their Power, <hi>that</hi> Balance
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:011212_0117_0F862E28E8FA1CC0"/>between the Prerogative of the Crown, and the Liberty of the Subject, which makes the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Government univerſally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired and revered. The Authors of that Suffering, at leaſt in ſome Meaſure, have been Perſons inveſted with Authority, who, tho' they eſteemed the CHURCH of <hi>England</hi> the moſt perfect Tranſcript, both as to Doctrine and Diſcipline, of the pure and amiable Religion of the holy Jeſus; yet ſuffered Numbers of the ſame Perſuaſion, to be deſtitute of what the <hi>Church</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders as inſtituted by the Apoſtles themſelves, who undoubtedly acted under divine Inſpiration.</p>
               <p>As to the Time paſt, I charitably hope this Neglect has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from Inattention, rather than Deſign. But what Reaſon can be now given for it, when the Members of the Church are warm in their Application, and are only oppoſed through blind Prejudice or miſchievous Deſigns? Shall the juſt Expectations of a Body of Men, whoſe Fidelity has been tried like Gold in the Fire, be fruſtrated merely to gratify a FACTION, which like the Cameleon perpetually changes Colour, and <hi>at one Time,</hi> under the Maſk of Religion, and Pretence of Liberty, actually overthrew the Conſtitution; at another, joined with a Popiſh Prince, to ſubvert our Liberties and introduce Tyranny and Superſtition? Shall this FACTION triumph in the Succeſs of thoſe Schemes, in the Proſecution of which it has groſsly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted the wiſeſt and beſt Men in the Nation, the truly venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Society for propagating the Goſpel,</hi> and falſly reviled that Religion which their Sovereign himſelf and the major Part of the Nation are firmly attached to? Shall they ſucceed in their Endeavours to render ſuſpected as aiming at <hi>Independency,</hi> thoſe very Perſons, whoſe Loyalty, <hi>they themſelves tell us,</hi> has never been queſtioned? Shall ſuch an unwarrantable Suſpicion be deemed ſufficient to juſtify the with holding from a conſiderable Part of his Majeſty's Subjects ſome of the ineſtimable Rights of Conſcience, innoxious to the Public, and ſecured to them by <hi>Magna Charta?</hi> Are not the Members of the CHURCH allied to the Mother Country in a more particular Manner, by the Agreement of their religious Tenets; and may they not be driven to ſome Act of Deſperation by being ſubjected to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Hardſhips, and refuſed the Privileges common to all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sects?</p>
               <p>Should we ſuppoſe a Debate in the Houſe of Commons upon this important Queſtion, <q>whether a Biſhop ſhould be ſent to <hi>America</hi> or no;</q> and that ſome paltry Copier of the <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Whig</hi> (if ſuch could there be found) had ſtarted the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection that this Meaſure would tend to free the Colonies from their
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:011212_0117_0F862E28E8FA1CC0"/>Dependance on <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> I think it might be anſwered in the following Manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>I am truly ſurpriſed, Gentlemen, at the Objection juſt now made to a Meaſure highly reaſonable in itſelf, and abſolutely requiſite for the CHURCH in <hi>America.</hi> The Colonies in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, are both by Principle and Intereſt dependant on the Mother Country; whoſe Conſtitution is the Model of their own, whoſe Protection has freed them from the Fear of their Enemies; and whoſe Manufactures are neceſſary to their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence.—Theſe are Ties of an indiſſoluable Nature, at leaſt ſo long as they are left in the undiſturbed Fruition of thoſe Rights, which they claim as inherent in them by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſecured by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Conſtitution; thoſe Rights for which your Anceſtors made the nobleſt Struggles, and which they gloried in delivering down inviolate to Poſterity. And tho' there may be ſome turbulent Spirits amongſt them, who were rocked in the Cradle of Sedition, and brought up in Principles ſubverſive of Order and Government<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet I truſt the Number is but ſmall, and am ſure their Influence can never be extenſive or laſting.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But let us not be induced by any groundleſs Calumnies to do Injuſtice to thoſe whom we have not the leaſt Reaſon to ſuſpect. The <hi>Churchmen</hi> in <hi>America</hi> are ſo well perſuaded of the Excellency and Moderation of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Government, and ſo fully ſenſible of the mutual Advantages accruing from the Dependance of the Colonies on <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> that tho' they may ſeek Redreſs by lawful Meaſures for what they eſteem Grievances, yet they would be the laſt to frame, or join in any Project to ſhake off that Dependance, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by leſſen thoſe Advantages. Beſides it may be worth our Conſideration whether we ought not to bind them to us by further Motives of Gratitude and Affection; the ſtrongeſt Methods to ſecure their Fidelity and Attachment.—I will venture to aſſert, Gentlemen, and I aſſert it with that Holdneſs which Truth never fails of inſpiring, that <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> has no Reaſon to be jealous of the CHURCH, but that the Members thereof will always be an Obſtacle to any Project of disjoining the Colonies from the Mother Country.</q>
               </p>
               <p>

                  <q>Conſider, Gentlemen, if you refuſe the CHURCH this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Requeſt (ſuppoſing it can conſcientiouſly be refuſed) you diſpirit the Friends of the Conſtitution, and afford Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Joy to thoſe, whoſe Attachment to it is far from clear, to Fanaticks and Independants.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>True Policy, excluſive of every other Motive, ought to make us carefully provide for the Welfare of the CHURCH in <hi>America.</hi> It's Principles and Conſtitution are ſo interwoven with, and adapted to thoſe of the State, that together both muſt flouriſh, both together fall. If we caſt our Eyes back to that unhappy Period when the great Barriers of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution were broken down; the Houſe of Lords (if I may uſe the Expreſſion) politically annihilated; and a <hi>Britiſh</hi> SOVEREIGN ignominiouſly led to the Block, was not the CHURCH an equal Sufferer, and by the ſame nefarious Hands?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Let us not then be ſwayed by Inſinuations, which original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceed from the Father of all Lies, and are induſtriouſly propagated by Malice and Bigotry—But let us give our Fellow Subjects and Members of the ſame Communion with ourſelves, thoſe Indulgencies which Reaſon and Equity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. The Biſhop will be appointed from hence, where his Connections will lie, and his Subſiſtence muſt in a great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure depend upon thoſe Funds which are here—By this Means HE will hardly think of joining with, or encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging the Colonies in any Scheme to become independant— —And as his influence will probably extend both to the Clergy and Laity of the CHURCH, the proper Dependance of Epiſcopalians on <hi>Great-Britain</hi> will be better ſecured even that at preſent.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>It may ſeem extraordinary to ſome, that I ſhould have thought this Objection worthy of a ſerious Anſwer. But bold and impudent Aſſertions even when unſupported by Plauſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, are apt to make too deep Impreſſions upon the ignorant and unwary—And tho' I truſt, they would not produce ſuch Effects within theſe Walls, yet the Friends of the CHURCH might have been ſuppoſed to admit the Charge were

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>AGREEABLE to the promiſe I made in my laſt letter, I ſhall now proceed to conſider the <hi>religious grievances</hi> of the AMERICANS; which, tho' not carried, as yet, to ſo great a height as thoſe of <hi>a civil nature,</hi> are, nevertheleſs, as real, and, if allowed to continue, and to operate their full effect, may perhaps become, in time, ſtill more intolerable. What I mean is, the deſign that has been formed to introduce into AMERICA, the <hi>epiſcopal perſuaſion,</hi> as the eſtabliſhed religion.</p>
               <p>This deſign, which is now no ſecret, has juſtly excited the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion and indignation of almoſt every AMERICAN. They ſay, and they ſay it truly, that it was in order to free themſelves from the tyranny and deſpotiſm of the <hi>epiſcopal hierarchy,</hi> that their anceſtors abandoned their native country, and took refuge in the barren wilds of the weſtern continent. And is it to be ſuppoſed that they will patiently bend their necks to a yoke, which neither they nor their fore-fathers have been able to bear? Is it to be ſuppoſed, that, after having enjoyed, for ſo long a time, the bleſſings of religious, and conſequently, of civil liberty, they will tamely forego them without a ſingle ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle? Thoſe who think ſo, know not human nature; for every
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:011212_0119_0F862E2A75F8A680"/>one that knows it, muſt be fully ſatisfied, that there is nothing of which mankind are ſo very tenacious as of their <hi>religious principles;</hi> and that almoſt every attempt to change theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, in oppoſition to the humour of the people, has termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in the deſtruction of the perſon who made it. Witneſs the injudicious and ill-timed attempt of King Charles the Firſt, to introduce into Scotland the <hi>epiſcopal</hi> form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For it may be ſafely affirmed, that notwithſtanding the many rude encroachments which that prince had made upon the <hi>civil</hi> rights of his Engliſh and his Scottiſh ſubjects, neither of theſe people would, at leaſt for ſome time, have riſen in arms, had it not been for the violent ſteps which his majeſty took to change the <hi>religious</hi> principles of the latter. This was the true ſource of the civil wars; and, in the like circumſtances, will ever be the ſource of civil wars. Nor, indeed, is it at all ſurpriſing that it ſhould: for can it be expected, that a people ſhould change their religion, their manners and their cuſtoms, in an inſtant, and with the ſame rapidity with which a prince or his miniſtry may publiſh the ordinance that eſtabliſhes a new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
               <p>The truth is, moſt miniſters conſider the people as clay in the hands of the potter, which they think they may mould into any ſhape they pleaſe; but I am afraid, that our preſent mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters will find the AMERICANS compoſed of every different mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. I am afraid, that, inſtead of clay, they will find them compoſed of ſteel, that will break before it will bend, and will perhaps cut the hand that ſhall attempt to bend it.</p>
               <p>But, admitting the poſſibily of eſtabliſhing <hi>epiſcopacy</hi> in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MERICA, ſuch a ſcheme could it actually be executed, ought to be ſtrenuouſly oppoſed by every friend to his country; as, were it once actually executed, it would certainly be attended with the moſt pernicious conſequences. It was, I think, a ſaying of king James the Firſt, No BISHOP, no KING; and, might I take the freedom of oppoſing a maxim of mine <hi>to that royal chopper of ſentences,</hi> I would ſay, and I believe, with equal truth, No DISSENTER, NO LIBERTY. THE DISSENTRRS are, and ever have been, the very life and ſoul of <hi>the republican part of our government.</hi> They have often ſaved it, when upon the brink of deſtruction; and it is to be hoped, they will ſtill ſave it, if ever it ſhould be again brought to the brink of deſtruction.</p>

And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ridicule may be thrown upon the Puritans by ſome court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ophants; I muſt confeſs, for my own part, I would rather be a Puritan, attached to law and liberty, than a Church-man, attatched to ſlavery and deſpotiſm: I would rather be a Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, who can ſit quietly under his own vine and his own fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, and none to make him afraid; than a Churchman, who is either employed in raviſhing the vineyards of others, or who, like Naboth, is in danger of having his own vineyard raviſhed from him.</p>
               <p>Accuſtomed to think freely in religious matters, the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Diſſenters have ever exerciſed the ſame freedom in their political ſpeculations. They plainly perceived the abſurd nature and pernicious tendency of the doctrine of <hi>divine indefeaſible heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary right,</hi> and of <hi>paſſive obedience</hi> and <hi>non-reſiſtance;</hi> and they accordingly rejected it with the utmoſt indignation. They bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly maintained, that all government was inſtituted for the good of the people; that the Salus Populi was the Suprema Lex; that the ſovereign was only the firſt ſervant of the public; that the prince, as well as the ſubject, was bound to obey the laws; that the moment the prince violated the laws, the ſubject was, at leaſt in that inſtance, freed from obedience; and that if ever the prince proceeded to ſuch a length as to violate the laws eſſential to the conſtitution, the ſubject was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely freed from his allegiance.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the principles, which the Diſſenters have ever em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced, and which they ſtill embrace. Theſe are the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, upon which the civil war was begun, and the revolution ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. Theſe are the principles, upon which the preſent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily was eſtabliſhed on the throne, upon which it ſtill poſſeſſes it, and upon which alone it can continue to poſſeſs it. And if ever any miniſter ſhould be ſo daringly wicked, as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe any prince of that family to violate theſe principles, he ought to be puniſhed as a traitor to his king and to his country.</p>
               <p>But, perhaps, it will be ſaid, that theſe principles have been always embraced, and with as much ſincerity, by the Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palians, as by the Diſſenters. If any one ſhould ſay ſo, the whole Engliſh hiſtory would give him the lie. Were they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by them in the reign of King James the Firſt, who, when, in the conference of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="231" facs="unknown:011212_0120_0F862E2B2557AD58"/>by them in the reign of King Charles the Firſt, whom they wickedly intoxicated with ſuch high notions of the royal prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, as precipitated him into meaſures that terminated in his own deſtruction and in the deſtruction of the monarchy? Were they embraced by them in the reign of King Charles the Second, to whom they ſuggeſted the moſt arbitrary councils, and whom they ſtrongly adviſed <hi>to get the doctrine of paſſive obedience enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a Law;</hi> and who, when that prince made a bold, and unhappily, but too ſucceſsful an effort to reign without parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo vigorouſly aſſiſted him in his unconſtitutional mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, that the hiſtorian <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>James's hiſt.</hi> 8<hi>vo. edit. vol.</hi> viii. <hi>p.</hi> 152.</note> above quoted, expreſsly ſays; the <q>clergy eſpecially were buſy in this great revolution; and being moved, partly by their own fears, partly by the inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations of the court, they repreſented all their antagoniſts as ſectaries and republicans, and rejoiced in eſcaping all thoſe perils, which they believed to have been hanging over them. <hi>Principles, the moſt oppoſite to civil liberty, were every where enforced from the pulpit,</hi> and adopted in numerous addreſſes; where the king was flattered in his preſent meaſures, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated on his eſcape from parliaments.</hi> Could words have been depended on, the nation appeard to be running faſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to voluntary ſervitude, and ſeemed even ambitious of reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the king's hands, all the privileges, tranſmitted to them, through ſo many ages, by their gallant an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And though they made ſome oppoſition to the violent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of King James the Second, yet was it chiefly becauſe their own order was attacked; for, had that prince been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with deſtroying only the civil liberties of the nation, without endeavouring to undermine its religion, 'tis more than probable that he might have carried his point, at leaſt for any interruption he was likely to have met with from the eſtabliſhed clergy.</p>
               <p>True it is, they concurred in the revolution; but with what ſincerity, the great number of them who refuſed to take the oaths to the new government, and the endleſs plots and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies they hatched againſt it, ſufficiently declare.</p>
               <p>Let it not, however, be imagined, that I mean to impute the above principles and practices to the whole body of the Epiſcopal Clergy. God fordid! I know there are ſome of the Epiſcopal Clergy, who are as ſtaunch friends to the liberty of the ſubject, as any Diſſenter in the kingdom; witneſs the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>author of the Confeſſional,</hi> and ſeveral others. I only mean
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:011212_0121_0F862E2BE87FC858"/>impute them to the high flying, Jacobite clergy, and to their deluded followers among the laity, who never were, and, I believe, never will be thoroughly reconciled to <hi>our free go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> and if ever they ſhould be reconciled to <hi>our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> I ſhall begin, I muſt own, to entertain a ſuſpicion, that <hi>our government it no longer free.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, though I mean not to impute the above principles and practices to the whole body of the Epiſcopal Clergy, I may yet, I am perſuaded, take upon me to aſſert, that the <hi>epiſcopal form of church government</hi> is much better adapted, than that of the <hi>preſbyterians</hi> or of <hi>any other ſect,</hi> to an <hi>abſolute monarchy;</hi> and for the truth of this aſſertion I appeal to the ſentiments of the moſt ſenſible writers who have treated of politics. The diſtance between the proud prelate and the poor curate is almoſt as great, as that between the grand monarch and the meaneſt of his menial ſervants. The truth is, the ſpirit of ſubordination that prevails in the <hi>epiſcopal form of church government,</hi> is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably calculated to preſerve <hi>order,</hi> or rather <hi>ſlavery,</hi> in civil ſociety; for is it to be ſuppoſed, that a man, poſſeſſed of about ten pounds a year, will dare to diſobey the orders of one, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, perhaps, of as many thouſands?</p>
               <p>'Tis an old and juſt obſervation, that <hi>ſuperſtition is an enemy to civil liberty,</hi> and <hi>enthuſiaſm a friend to it.</hi>—But it is well known, that the Church of England partakes conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the <hi>ſuperſtitious character;</hi> and that all the Diſſenters are, more or leſs, remarkable for <hi>enthuſiaſm.</hi> That this is the natural tendency of ſuperſtition, will be evident to any one who conſiders the ſituation of France, of Spain, or of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Roman catholic country,</hi> where ſuperſtition prevails in its full force, and where the poor people are held in ſuch a ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh ſubjection by their ſpiritual and temporal rulers, that they are almoſt looked upon as beings of an inferior ſpecies. It is commonly reported of a <hi>French biſhop,</hi> who was a Man of Quality, as moſt of the <hi>French biſhops</hi> are, that, thinking it beneath his dignity to addreſs his flock in the uſual ſtyle, <hi>Mes cheres freres,</hi> or <hi>Dearly beloved brethren,</hi> he began his ſermon thus; <hi>Canaille Chretien, eco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>tez la parole de Dieu; Ye Chriſtian Scoundrels, liſten to the word of God!</hi> Such were the ideas of a due <hi>ſubordination,</hi> with which <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> inſpired this right reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend and honourable prelate!</p>
               <p>But not only is the <hi>epiſcopal form of church government an enemy to liberty</hi> and <hi>a friend to ſlavery,</hi> by the ſtrong mixture of <hi>ſuperſtition</hi> which it contains, and by the infinite <hi>diſtinction</hi> it makes among the different members, of which it is compoſed: it is likewiſe ſo, by the great member of uſeleſs prieſts with which it is encumbered, by the immenſe wealth poſſeſſed by theſe
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:011212_0121_0F862E2BE87FC858"/>prieſts, and by the unequal diſtribution of that wealth among the ſeveral perſons belonging to the prieſthood.</p>
               <p>The <hi>clergy</hi> of Scotland, if I am rightly informed, do not amount to one thouſand. The <hi>clergy</hi> of England, I believe, fall not greatly ſhort of twelve thouſand.—So that, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the <hi>clergy</hi> to bear the ſame proportion to the <hi>laity</hi> in both theſe kingdoms, England ſhould contain twelve times as many inhabitants as Scotland. But England, according to the higheſt computation, does not contain above three, or, at moſt, four times as many inhabitants as Scotland; ſo that, making allowance for the greater number of people in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer than in the latter, for every <hi>clergyman</hi> in Scotland there are at leaſt three, if not four, in England. And, as the number of <hi>clergy</hi> in England, is ſo much larger than in Scotland, their revenues, it is well known, are proportionably large. The whole annual revenue of the <hi>Scotiſh clergy</hi> does not exceed 80,000 pounds; a ſum hardly equal to what is poſſeſſed by the <hi>biſhops alone,</hi> and perhaps not one tenth of what is poſſeſſed by the whole body of the <hi>Engliſh clergy.</hi> And as the annual reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of the <hi>Engliſh clergy</hi> is ſo much greater than that of the <hi>Scotch,</hi> it is divided, it is certain, among the different members in a much more unequal and diſproportionate manner. Few <hi>Scotiſh clergymen</hi> have leſs than fifty, and few more than a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds a year. But, as I hinted above, ſome <hi>Engliſh clergymen</hi> have ten thouſand, and ſome little more than ten pounds a year. Such an infinite difference is there, in the number of clergymen, in the amount of their revenue, and in the diſtribution of that revenue, between the <hi>epiſcopal</hi> and the <hi>preſbyterian</hi> eſtabliſhments; and ſo much more favourable is the former, than the latter, to an abſolute and pure monarchy! But as the Engliſh government never was, is not now, and I hope never will be an abſolute and pure monarchy, ſo I pray I may never be ſo unhappy as to live to ſee the time when the <hi>epiſcopal perſuaſion</hi> ſhall be extended over the whole Britiſh do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions; for, if ever that time ſhould unfortunately arrive, I will take upon me to affirm, that our liberties are, from that moment, irrecoverably ruined.</p>
               <p>I will, indeed, admit, that the <hi>epiſcopal</hi> religion is the chief ſupport of the <hi>monarchical</hi> part of our government; and ſo far I wiſh it may always be preſerved in its preſent condition. But, as I never deſire to ſee the <hi>monarchical</hi> part of our government enlarged, ſo neither do I deſire to ſee the <hi>epiſcopal</hi> religion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended beyond its preſent bounds. Our government, as I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in my laſt letter, partakes more of a <hi>republic</hi> than of a <hi>monarchy.</hi> The <hi>epiſcopalians</hi> are the chief ſupport of the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchical</hi>

               <p>Let the miniſtry, therefore, drop their ill judged ſcheme of eſtabliſhing <hi>epiſcopacy</hi> in America; and let the <hi>biſhop</hi> of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> who has lately been appointed one of the L—of Tr—e and Pl—ns, direct his attention rather to <hi>temporal</hi> than to <hi>ſpiritual</hi> objects.

               <p>I had ſaid, that to ſuch an ignorant fellow as I was, nothing ſeemed, at leaſt ſo well, to admit of a reply as an untruth; but that Mr. P. ſcorning ſuch ordinary buſineſs, appear'd ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious

               <p>Par. 5th. His conceptive powers ſeem weak as to the danger, but very ſtrong as to the attainableneſs of PRELACY, in a Church which has not ſo much as exiſtence without it (ha! ha! ha!) i. e. according to him, THE CHURCH in America is no Church at all. His way of "turning the tables" is ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtical;—we never ſaid, "Church-men ſhould not have a ſingle clergyman ordained, except he went to England;" much leſs that "they ſhould for ever be obliged to go there: To bring the matter to a fair iſſue, let him (with all his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and goodneſs of heart) imagine himſelf a diſſenter, Par. 6th He confeſſes himſelf no match for you (i. e. me) at giving de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate epithets —he wrongs himſelf; but the public will give him the diſavowed character due to ſuch ſingular modeſty.</p>
               <p>Hitherto I've us'd this piddler as a play thing; but his 7th par, half excites my indignation, he repreſents me as in effect ſaying, that the right of epiſcopacy muſt neceſſarily be as human in America as in England; when I only inferred, it could not be more divine. How miſerable the cauſe in which ſuch reſources are thought neceſſary! Far from "confounding diſtinct things" I rather diſtinguiſh'd confounded things; ſo that his trite chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter about his lordſhip and Timothy (par. 8th) is as impertinent as it is <hi>gratis dictum,</hi> and his miſtake (if ſuch it be) lies in ſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, againſt what he did not underſtand.

               </opener>
               <p>THOUGH the Church in America has ever ſtudied aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to promote Concord, and to conciliate Peace with every Denomination; yet, a reſtleſs Party, diſcontented with the freeſt Enjoyment of their religious Privileges have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually waring againſt her, and conſtantly increaſing in their Virulence, and Animoſity. From the Heighths to which they have already riſen, every Friend to Liberty and Juſtice, may judge what the eſtabliſhed Church muſt expect from an <hi>Increaſe</hi> of their Power.</p>
               <p>So gigantic at this Day are their Strides, that for a candid Appeal to the Public in its Behalf, his Majeſty's and the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Religion, has been ſtigmatized in the moſt injurious Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and a Biſhop under the Reſtrictions propoſed, threatened with a Reception ſimilar to that of the Commiſſioners of a late Act. Whether ſuch a Conduct is agreeable to their Profeſſions of a Love to religious Liberty, and the Intereſts of their Country, I leave to their moſt inſatuated Votaries to determine. Every good Man will endeavour to calm as much as poſſible the Spirit of Party; but theſe Men, fond of fiſhing in troubled Waters, have ever made it their Study to promote Diſſentions. For this Reaſon, in this Country where ever the Name were in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral unheard of, they would diffuſe the Principles of Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:011212_0124_0F862E2E2469E640"/>among us, by the Party Diſtinctions of Whig and Tory; and kindle Diſcord in the Church by a Diviſion into High and low. To Anſwer the laſt mentioned End, the American Whig has affected the Guiſe and Appearance of a Churchman,—that he may ſtab us the more ſenſibly. But I am confident that his Diſguiſe is ſo thin, that he ſtands expos'd to the Scorn of every juſt Man, and the Contempt of the weakeſt. However as Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is deſtructive by whatever Hand adminiſtred, I ſhall make ſuch Obſervations on his Attempt in the 25th No. of the Whig, as I flatter myſelf will be a ſufficient Antidote, and point out the Author's native Hideouſneſs.</p>
               <p>The two firſt Paragraphs of this Epiſtle are taken up with abuſive Reflections on the Britiſh Hierarchy, without Advancing one Proof of his foul-mouth'd Aſſertions. They are thick ſown with Reflections on the "Pride, Ambition, and Tyranny of Prieſts;" and the evident Intent of them appears to be, to excite an Odium againſt Prelacy. Now, tho' ſuch an Epiſcopate as he combats with was never deſired—tho' the <hi>onus probandi</hi> lies on him, and theſe Affirmations might float down the Tide of Oblivion with the reſt of thoſe light, unſubſtantial, unprov'd Aſſeverations which he has thrown out, and which the Reader is no more obliged to ſwallow than the Deciſions of the Pope: Yet ſince by their being ſo often repeated in ſo rancorous a Manner, they may tend to excite in weak Minds a Diſreſpect for the preſent Conſtitution of Government; I ſhall offer a few Particulars worthy the Conſideration of every Well-wiſher to his Country.</p>
               <p>Since the Legiſlature, for the Preſervation of true Religion, has wiſely eſtabliſhed a Church, which differs only from other Denominations, for the moſt Part, in mere external Modes, and her external Modes are deemed moſt conſonant to the Principles of Government, every true patriot will either promote ſuch an Eſtabliſhment, or at leaſt not oppoſe it.</p>
               <p>Again,—If the Legiſlature, for the Encouragement and Support of this Church, has decreed to thoſe whom it judges moſt capacitated for her Service by their Piety, Learning, or Aſſiduity, certain Immunities and Honours, every Friend to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Society muſt approve of the Procedure.</p>
               <p>Since theſe eccleſiaſtical Rights and Immunities, are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven with the civil Polity, and have been ſo moulded and faſhioned with the Conſtitution of the State, that the Exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Prelacy, will either deſtroy or very much endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the Common-Wealth; every wiſe Politician will ſupport the one, if only to preſerve the other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="240" facs="unknown:011212_0125_0F862E3069AE6518"/>Further,—ſince the preſent Biſhops make no undue uſe of their Powers, but mildly exerciſe them to charitable Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes,—to the Increaſe of Proteſtantiſm and Learning, to the Relieving the Poor, the Propagation of the Goſpel, and the Diminution of Vice and Ignorance; it follows, that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever by oppugning and maligning them, endeavours to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh their Uſefulneſs, proves himſelf an Enemy to the Intereſts of Religion and his Country, and acts contrary to the Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Proteſtant and true Briton.</p>
               <p>Our pious Fore-fathers, led by the Example of all former Ages, conſidering their Obligations to Gratitude greater than thoſe of any other Nation; remembring the Promiſe our LORD and SAVIOUR has made unto them, who ſhould confer the ſmalleſt Favour on his Diſciples; reflecting how earneſt the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle is in arguing, That if the Miniſters of the Law were ſo amply provided for, leſs Care ought not to be had of thoſe, who under the Goſpel poſſeſſed correſpondent Situations in the Church; knowing how expedient and neceſſary it was that thoſe Rulers, who are eſpecially commanded to be given to Hoſpitality, and to provoke all others by Examples of Charity, ſhould have Means by which they might effectually perform theſe Duties.—Conſidering theſe Things, they liberally ſet apart Livings, Lands and Poſſeſſions, for the Uſe of the Church; and tho' theſe have been invaded by the avaricious Hand of Perſecution, and mangled by the ſacrilegious Jaws of Rapine and Rebellion, yet a Remnant continues to this Day; —and will continue ſo long as Juſtice, Learning, and true Religion ſurvive!</p>
               <p>The Practice of ſtrengthening the Reins of Government, by a Reverence paid to the Officers employed in the Service of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſeems to be founded on a Dictate of natural Reaſon, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted by all Nations, and authorized by the Example of God himſelf, the divine Legiſlator of the Jews. So weak is human Nature, that it looks upon Poverty (however unjuſtly) with Contempt. To avoid this, ſince a Reverence for Governors is eſſentially neceſſary to the Preſervation of Order, prudent Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlatures have annexed Degrees of Dignity and Honour to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very public Office, according to its Uſefulneſs. As therefore the Officers appointed for the Promotion of Religion, are the firſt in Expediency, it is wiſe to encourage them with adequate Supports.—Again, it is agreeable to ſound Policy, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage as many Perſons of Learning and Abilities in the Service of any Society as poſſible: For Reaſon and Experience pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, that without the Aids and Ornaments of Learning, no
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:011212_0125_0F862E3069AE6518"/>Society will either flouriſh or be much reſpected. Now it is evident that the wiſeſt Men will generally want the Incitements of Honour and Fortune, as Rewards for their Labours, and Spurs to their Diligence. Wiſe therefore is it in any Nation to ſtimulate Men of Learning to thoſe Offices which are eſſential to its well-being, by proper Rewards.—Further, Want begets Servility, which is inconſiſtent with Superintendency. Men likewiſe, in ſuch a Situation, are more ſubject to the Becks of Power, and more liable to Bribery and Corruption. The Poverty alſo of ſome of the Clergy, has, in the Opinion of the wiſeſt Politicians, occaſioned moſt of that Neglect and Deſpite with which the Order itſelf is too frequently treated, to the great Prejudice and Obſtruction of Chriſtianity. Much more juſt Cauſe of Declamation, are thoſe Penſions which are ſquandered on the Idle, the Vicious, and Profane, than that Proviſion for the decent Support of Men, who are the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porters, (under God) of Proteſtantiſm; who are Ornaments of their Country, and the firmeſt Defenders of every Species of Liberty.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, to doubt of the Propriety of their retaining their legal Incomes, is to call in queſtion the Knowledge of thoſe Men, who rear'd the Fabric of our happy Conſtitution, and ſo combined its Powers, that to take them away, would render the Scale of Authority, ſo well-balanced, unequal. Upon the Whole, I doubt not but thoſe very confident Aſſertors, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican Whig, and his Aſſociates, appear in the Eyes of all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Men, in the very Colours with which they would paint others; for, like the Papiſts, Enemies to our good Government, they have ever endeavoured to foment Diviſions among his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's peaceable Subjects by railing againſt Eſtabliſhments, and ſcattering their poiſonous, diſcordant Principles round the Land. They have alſo acted repugnant to the Spirit of Chriſtianity, which breathes a Love for all Mankind: which is tender, long ſuffering, pitiful, courteous, which deſpiſes the narrow Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Rancour and Sectariſm; which hopeth all Things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth all Things. Their Conduct is alſo inconſiſtent with ſound Policy, which bids us diffuſe among our fellow Subjects a Reverence for Government; which enjoins us to promote the general Intereſts of Religion; and which at this nice Juncture direct us, more eſpecially, to increaſe Harmony and Union, and to ſtrengthen, as much as poſſible, the Reins of Government.</p>

My Situation, whether conſidered abſtractedly, as relating only to myſelf, or as it is rendered more diſmal by that of my fellow Priſoners, has been gloomy indeed, and I can truly ſay, that 'till the Publication of your firſt Number, I was altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy: But as the Tranſactions of you Mortals are not hid from our Eyes, the American Whig in all his Glory, could not fail of contributing ſome Relief to thoſe Agonies of Mind I have ſo long ſuffered, in beholding England, and its Dependen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, flouriſhing under the Eſtabliſhment of religious Principles, diametrically oppoſite to thoſe which I ſo ſtrongly inculcated by myſelf and Emiſſaries, and which with unſpeakable Joy, I find you and my other Friends ſo faithfully adhere to. Go on with unabating Vigour; and let no Conſiderations of Religion or Humanity ſtop you in your Career: Be aſſured of the Truth of what I ſo loudly proclaimed, that while the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land as by law eſtabliſhed has the Aſcendency in the Britiſh Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, our Cauſe can never flouriſh. You know, my worthy Friend, how contradictory that Church and all its Doctrines are to our paſt, preſent, and future Views. While ſhe ſubſiſts in her prefent Form, it will be utterly impoſſible even to totter the Conſtitution of the preſent State, much more to tumble it into thoſe Ruins, upon which alone we and our Friends may ariſe into that Power which we have ſo long and ſo arduouſly ſought after, Prelacy and Plumb Pudding muſt be aboliſhed; Biſhops and Lawn Sleeves muſt be rooted out; and no Pains muſt be leſt untaken, no Steps nor Deſigns untried, to accompliſh ſo glorious a Purpoſe. To this End, let all your Preachers thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der out Anathemas againſt all the Promoters, or even ſilent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provers, of Epiſcopalian Worſhip: Let them bid the People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of that Scarlet Whore the Church of England, and keep wiſely ſeparated from a For<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>From Mr. PARKER'S GAZETTE Oct. 31. The AMERICAN WHIG, No. XXXIV.</head>
               <p>A Superſtructure, whoſe foundation gives way, and muſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very few years, receive new props for its ſupport, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently not the contrivance of a wiſe maſter-builder. That this is the caſe, with modern epiſcopacy, will be evident to every one, who conſiders, the ſeveral foundations, which have been at different times eſteemed its ſupport. If we look back but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thirty years, we ſhall find the then advocates for dioceſan epiſcopacy, endeavouring to defend their cauſe, by alledging, that the ſacred ſcripture expreſsly ſpeaks of Biſhops in the church. They depended upon making it appear, that thoſe who in the New Teſtament, are ſtiled <hi>Biſhops,</hi> were an order diſtinct from, and ſuperior to, ſuch as were ſtiled <hi>Preſbyters.</hi>— While theſe ſcripture-biſhops were trumped up, as a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient foundation for modern epiſcopacy; the diſtinction between Apoſtles, and all other goſpel miniſters, was readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. It was readily acknowledged, that the <hi>apoſtolate</hi> was a gift received immediately from Chriſt, that it was a perſonal gift, not to be communicated from one to another,—it was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily acknowledged, that Apoſtles, as diſtinct from, and ſuperior to all other goſpel-miniſters, were made ſuch, by their being <hi>choſen witneſſes of Chriſt, to the world; that he had appeared in the fleſh, that he had ſuffered, died, aroſe from the dead, and aſcended into Heaven.</hi> By their being <hi>inſpired,</hi> or <hi>divinely illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated with the knowledge of the whole goſpel ſcheme.</hi>— By their being entruſted with the important meſſage of <hi>publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the world the truths and doctrines of the goſpel; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring the way of life, and terms of Salvation.</hi>—And by their being authoriſed to <hi>conſtitute, form and regulate the goſpel church ſtate, according to the mind of Chriſt; together with a capacity to give full proof of their acting with authority from Chriſt, in thoſe matters, by working miracles, &amp;c'</hi> Theſe things uſed to be acknowledged to be the things by which the Apoſtles as ſuch, were conſtituted, and diſtinguiſhed from all other mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in the church. It uſed to be acknowledged that the commiſſion in Matt. xxviii. 28, did relate to them, not as A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:011212_0127_0F862E32935514D8"/>but as the order of miniſters, which was to continue in the church, to the end of the world; and conſequently in which they were to have ſucceſſors. It is but a ſew years ſince, that the warmeſt advocates for epiſcopacy, could readily ſee and admit theſe diſtinguiſhing gifts and qualifications, which conſtituted, and were eſſential to the apoſtolick office; while they depended upon ſupporting epiſcopacy, by the inſtances of ſuch as were ſtiled Biſhops in the New-Teſtament. But having been obliged, by the ſuperior force of truth, to acknowledge, that in the ſcripture, the term <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and <hi>Preſbyter</hi> or <hi>Elder,</hi> are promiſcuouſly uſed for the ſame office; they now generally give up what but about thirty years ago, was their whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence; and are obliged to fabricate a new foundation to ſupport their admired epiſcopacy. The preſent ſcheme is to make us believe, that the biſhops of the Church of England, are Apoſtles. The preſent zealots for prelacy are ſo ſtrangely infatuated, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to deny, that any thing extraordinary, is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to make an apoſtle. They can now ſee none of thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary gifts, conferred upon the twelve Apoſtles by Chriſt himſelf, as being neceſſary; but ſuppoſe that men at this day, may warrantably act as Apoſtles, without any of thoſe gifts, by virtue of the commiſſion Chriſt gave to the ſtanding officers in the church. And by this new ſcheme would perſuade us, that the preſent ſet of Biſhops in the Engliſh church, are as much Apoſtles, and as much veſted with the apoſtolick office and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as ever were Peter or Paul. <hi>A notable ſcheme this!</hi> And which, if they can eſtabliſh, will effectually ſupport their lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and domineering purpoſes. For if their Biſhops, are equal with the Apoſtles, in point of office and authority, then they have as much power to mould and faſhion the form and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the church, to their own humour and liking, as the twelve Apoſtles had. And to diſpute the matter with them, is to diſpute the authority of an Apoſtle; and equally criminal with rejecting the authority of the ſacred books of the New-Teſtament. To what length will blind zoal, and party ſpirit carry weak mortals!</p>
               <p>But before we oppoſe the authority of an Apoſtle, let us hear their defence, and ſee what evidence they adduce that their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Dr. Chandler tells us, that he will only give us a ſketch of the arguments of epiſcopacy; and for better ſatisfaction, refers us to Archbiſhop Potter, and Mr. Leaming. And in the laſt of thoſe authors, do we find in page 10. this remarkable intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, <q>Let it be carefully remarked, that thoſe who were commiſſioned to ſend others, were called <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in the
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:011212_0128_0F862E32A0BD06F8"/>Time when the New-Teſtament was penned; but in the next, and after ages, out of honour to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the <hi>apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick office,</hi> had the name of <hi>Biſhop</hi> appropriated to it.</q> LET IT BE CAREFULLY REMARKED that out of honour to the firſt ſet of Apoſtles, the very next ſet of Apoſtles, laid aſide the name which Chriſt had given to that order; and inſtead of it, took the name of <hi>Biſhop,</hi> which till then, did belong to that order which was alſo ſtiled Elders! <hi>Let it be carefully remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> that this alteration in the uſe of words, was brought about, all the world over, through the whole church, immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the death of the laſt of the Apoſtles; that thoſe who till then, were diſtinguiſhed by the title of <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> ſhould all agree to lay aſide that title, ſo that no ONE, in the church univerſal, was ever known to be ſtiled an Apoſtle, after the death of the <hi>firſt twelve;</hi> and that all ſuch as were really Apoſtles, ſhould, forever after be known, and diſtinguiſhed by the title of <hi>Biſhop,</hi> which till that moment, had been given only to Preſbyters. <hi>Let it be carefully remarked;</hi> and truly remarkable it is, that ſuch a piece of hiſtory ſhould life ſo long concealed, and never be publiſhed to the world, till within theſe few years.</p>
               <p>Upon hearing ſo extraordinary a novelty, the following inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries will naturally ariſe in the minds of the curious: If the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſett of Apoſtles, were really Apoſtles as well as the firſt; what reaſon could they have, for ſuch an exceſſive veneration for the perſons of their immediate predeceſſors, as to relinquiſh the title Chriſt had given to their office; and rob another ſett of officers in the church, of a title which did confeſſedly belong to them? Or was the ſecond ſett of Apoſtles, aſhamed to be known by the title, which had been given to the poor fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Gallilee? Or was it for ſear that if they retained the nam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, they ſhould alſo be expoſed to like ſufferings with their predeceſſors? Or is it not, becauſe that after the death of the firſt <hi>twelve,</hi> there were none who were really Apoſtles? This is the true reaſon, why there have been none ſince, who have pretended to the name, till very lately? It is therefore to be hoped, that theſe retailers of ancient hiſtory, will in ſome fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture publications, inform the world how theſe things were.</p>
               <p>Again, this author, to whom the Dr. refers us, exerts him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to prove that Timothy was an Apoſtle in the church of Epheſus. And in proof of it, recites ſeveral particular charges, which the Apoſtle Paul gave him, in the two epiſtles written to him, which he ſuppoſeth would ſerve to ſhew Timothy, to have authority in the church above, and over Preſbyters; and that he muſt therefore neceſſarily be an Apoſtle. But let Timothy have what authority over the Elders in the church of Epheſus,
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:011212_0128_0F862E32A0BD06F8"/>he can ſuppoſe; It is evident that the Apoſtle Paul exerciſed much more authority over Timothy, than the <hi>Apoſtle Timothy</hi> did over the Elders of Epheſus. And conſequently, according to this argument, there muſt be Apoſtles over Apoſtles, as well as Apoſtles over Elders. And where ſhall we ſtop, till we come to the <hi>Apoſtle general,</hi> the pretended ſucceſſor of Peter?</p>
               <p>It is very evident, that Timothy, as well as ſeveral other e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, were under the authority and direction of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle Paul; and were ſent by him to one place after another, as occaſion required. And Timothy diſcovered a continual readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to comply with his injunctions in the propagating of the goſpel, and in the ſervice of the churches. But if Timothy was an Apoſtle as well as Paul, why do we not ſome times find him called an Apoſtle? Why do we not find him ſome times, ſending Paul from one church to another, as well as Paul's ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him. The Apoſtle Paul, wrote many epiſtles to the churches; and it was his common method, in his introduction to ſtile himſelf an Apoſtle. In many of theſe epiſtles, Timothy alſo is joined with him: And the introduction runs in this form, "Paul an Apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt. and "Timothy our brother." Why does Paul ſtile himſelf an Apoſtle, unleſs it is to give weight and authority to his epiſtles? And if Timothy was alſo an Apoſtle, why was not his apoſtolic character alſo mentioned to impart an additional weight? Or was the Apoſtle Paul ſo aſpiring and lordly, as not to ſuffer his brother-apoſtle Timothy to have equal honour with himſelf? Theſe are inquiries of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance in this caſe, and call loudly for a full and ſatisfactory ſolution, before a ſubmiſſion to the apoſtolic character and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, of theſe pretended ſucceſſors of the apoſtles can be reaſonably expected.</p>
               <p>While we view this ſtruggle, for the ſupport of modern epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, and obſerve how often they are obliged to replace the foundation that ſupports it; that as often as they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves confuted upon one plan they ſo readily form to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves another; which with much patching, may ſerve their cauſe, for about fifteen or twenty years; and is then given up by their abſent advocates, and a new one ſubſtituted in its room: Who, I ſay, can ſuppoſe ſuch a tottering building to be the workmanſhip of the divine architect? The preſent ſcheme of making Apoſtles of their Biſhops is too chimerical to be long in vogue; and too ridiculous to bear a ſerious confutation— But weak as it is, it muſt be aſſerted, till ſome proliſic genius ſhall invent another ſubſtitute.</p>

               <p>A great many years ago (long before the <hi>citizen</hi> was born) Biſhops were ſolicited for <hi>America;</hi>—5 or 6 years ago the affair was vehemently urg'd at home (diſintereſtedly no doubt!) by one Dr. S—; and more lately a (ſtill more impatient) <hi>convention</hi> of ſcarce leſs than—XX clergymen, ſent home to their ſuperiors no leſs than 7 urgent petitions for a <hi>right re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend father</hi> or two, and, that their downy lordſhips on their arrival might have as little noiſe as poſſible to diſturb their repoſe, AFTERWARDS commiſſion'd the velvet-mouth'd Dr. C. to aſſure the people, that their lordſhips wou'd not hurt 'em. But the more prudent, alarm'd, as much perhaps by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſterous conduct of the affair, and the pains taken to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The fly tendency of a conſiderable part of the 1ſt of the C<hi>'s</hi> pieces under conſideration, is to repreſent diſſenters as enemies to all <hi>civil,</hi> as well as epiſcopal government, (elſe what means the tale about <hi>German</hi> fanatics, &amp;c.?) yet all this Sq. <hi>T.</hi> calls

               <p>Par. 4th. The <hi>C.</hi> charges the <hi>Whig</hi> with ſelf-contradiction; he deſerves to be <hi>whipp'd</hi> for lying. For truth's ſake, reader, compare this par. with the Whig's 1ſt N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. and then tell me what you think of a cauſe which needs falſhood for its ſupport, and of a paper in which this little Whig pecker can find no holes but ſuch as he has made himſelf.</p>
               <p>The letter from <hi>John Winthrop</hi> and <hi>Co.</hi> is a ſtrong proof of the piety, charity, and affection of thoſe our forefathers; but, as it contains not the moſt diſtant invitation of any Biſhop to mortify himſelf ſo much as to accompany them, it ſeems not ſufficient to prove (as it ſhould ſeem deſigned) that <hi>they,</hi> if now living, would be more urgent for the importation of <hi>ſpiritual carnalities</hi> than <hi>we</hi> their "degenerate ſons" are.—<hi>Quere,</hi> was not the ſcrap of <hi>Greek</hi> in the 6th. par. deſign'd to give the good old ladies of this city &amp;c. important ideas of the <hi>citizen's</hi> erudition?</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Proceed to make ſome Remarks on the remaining Parts of the Letter ſign'd an American Churchman. <q>In ſpite (ſays he) of all the Addreſs of the Partizans of the Scheme to conceal their true Aim, they have given ſo many Proofs, that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:011212_0130_0F862E3A44787860"/>and Biſhops are the Characters they wiſh to ſee eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among us. And whether this is ſufficiently proved muſt be left to the Public to determine.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That any Evidence has been brought of this Aſſertion, I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely deny;—to prove it the American Whig has la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured only by the Perverſion of harmleſs Sentences in the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, which common Senſe muſt evince could never be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in that Meaning. On the other Hand, he has paſſed by unnoticed, that Section, wherein the Plan is fairly ſtated; and where it is declared, that without Equivocation or Reſervation, the Biſhops requeſted are to have no Authority, but purely of a ſpiritual and eccleſiaſtical Nature, ſuch as is deriv'd altogether from the Church, and not from the State. The contrary to this I defy his evidencing from any Thing urged by the "Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zans of the Scheme," either in public or private.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>If (he goes on) the Introduction of Prelacy to ſubjugate the Colonies to the Tyranny of Prieſts, is the Object of Dr. Chandler, and the Convention, it becomes every true Son of the Church, every. &amp;c. to riſe up and ſet his Face like a Flint againſt a Scheme of ſo pernicious a Tendency.</q> Rare Argumentation for a public Writer! a meer <hi>petitio Principii,</hi> (as the Schoolmen ſay:) But ſuch has been the Foundation of moſt of that pretty Superſtructure with which your Opponent has amus'd the Public.—Indeed, it ſuch is the Deſign of Dr. Chandler and the Convention, the moſt bigotted and ſtrenuous Advocate for an American Epiſcopate, (I confeſs) ought and will oppoſe it.—But on this Hinge turns the Diſpute, and this, ſhould theſe bitter Opponents have proved,—contrary to the Declarations of Men whoſe Characters are expos'd to the View of the World, to the publiſh'd Plan, and the received Opinions and declared Sentiments of the Society for the Propagation of the Goſpel, and the higheſt Dignitaries of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: They ſhould have evinced theſe Declarations to have been untrue by more valid Facts; the Plan to have been falſe, by producing and proving another agreed on; and theſe Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments adopted, to be erroneous, by the Proffer of unyielding Truths; if they would deſerve the Characters of Chriſtians, Lovers of Truth, Gentlemen, and Friends of their Country and Mankind. On the contrary, always pre-ſuppoſing this to be true, they have work'd themſelves into a Ferment, puff'd up their Diſciples with Rage and Zeal, to a danger of Suffocation; beſpatter'd all around them, and purſued the Bugg bear, till they have left themſelves in ſuch a Situation, as to attract a rude Stare from Fools,—Laughter and Contempt from the Wiſe,—the Scorn of good Men, and Approbation only from
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:011212_0131_0F862E3C78E0BAE0"/>thoſe who are too prejudic'd, or too blind to ſee their Nakedneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That the Majority (continues he) of Epiſcopalians are not chargeable with this dangerous Enterpriſe, ſhall be the Scope of this Letter.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What dangerous Enterpriſe? If he means <q>of ſubjugating the Colonies to the Tyranny of Prieſts,</q> he attempts to prove what no one denies, or have ever denied. <q>But (ſays he) 'tis to remove any ſuch Suſpicions, which the guilty Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Plot, are falſely, and wickedly endeavouring to propagate.</q> Indeed Mr. Tickle, I am at a Loſs to account by another Way, than the Cauſe, for ſuch groſs Prevarications, Inſinuations, and Accuſations. I challenge him to prove any Authors of ſuch a Plot, or to point out the Paper wherein, or the Perſons (excepting the American Whig, and his Allies) by whom American Churchmen are accus'd of <q>enterpriſing the Subjugation of the Colonies to the Tyranny of Prieſts by the Introduction of Prelacy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But if he intended, by expreſſing it in this looſe indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Manner, to leave Room for Equivocation,—that Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men might imagine he meant to vindicate them from any Deſign againſt their Country; and his own Diſciples interpret it as a Proof that the Majority of Epiſcopalians were averſe to the Plan of an Epiſcopate as propos'd by Dr. Chandler. By what I have ſaid before, the Needleſsneſs, and conſequently Impropriety of undertaking it in the firſt Senſe, is evident; and I doubt not, I ſhall in my following Remarks, make its Abſurdity, Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Incongruity for the laſt Purpoſe, obvious to his moſt inſatuated Votaries.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>This (ſays he) may be argued from the Character and Principles of American Churchmen; the Conduct of the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners for an Epiſcopate, and the Nature and Method of their Defence, againſt the Attacks they have received.</q> Firſt, he attempts to prove it from deſcribing thoſe Parts only of the Character of Churchmen which ſeem to anſwer his Purpoſe.— Now ſuppoſing the Portrait to be drawn to the Life; it proves nothing in his Favour. For granting that American Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are <q>Enemies to the ſlaviſh Doctrines of paſſive Obedience and Non-reſiſtance;</q> 
                  <q>That they excelled in a late memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Oppoſition to the Stamp-Act,</q> conceding even what is the labour'd Aim of theſe Paragraphs; <q>That they are the moſt frugal Oeconomiſts in the World;</q> yet it follows not from this that they will be averſe to an Epiſcopate, when they are not required (to uſe a coarſe Expreſſion from the Paper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me) "to open their Purſe Strings," but to have him ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by a Fund graciouſly beſtow'd for that Purpoſe by Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors.
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:011212_0131_0F862E3C78E0BAE0"/>Neither tho' Churchmen were watchful (as the Whig deſcribes them) of the undue Extenſion of the Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, does it follow that they are "oppos'd to a Biſhop ſo limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his Powers."</p>
               <p>But this Picture of American Churchmen, I deny to be a juſt one; the Lineaments are rough, the Colours laid coarſely on, and ſome Features ſeem rather to be trac'd from the Figure of the four, narrow hearted Preſbyterian, than the open-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanc'd and generous Churchman.</p>
               <p>That the Spectator may be better judge of the Truths of this Aſſertion, I will juſt pencil out in Miniature, a Portrait of Churchmen, whereby it will appear what a Variation he has made from the Original.</p>
               <p>In their political Principles American Churchmen in general are fix'd between the Bitterneſs of Modern Whigs, and the Servility of ancient Tories. To his Majeſty and the Royal Family, they bear the warmeſt and moſt unalterable Affection, and are ever ready to ſupport him in his kingly Power.—Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the Excellence of the Britiſh Conſtitution, they will ever be ready to preſerve and defend it, and to lay down their Lives in its Support. Convinced of the Bleſſings reſulting from the Balance of Authority in the State they deſire it may ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main equi-poiſed. Not more ſolicitous are they to preſerve the Rights of the People, than his Majeſty's Prerogative inviolable. They are ſteady Friends to Order and Diſcipline in Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ever ready to put an End to Diſcord and Confuſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>But (ſays this Anti-Churchman) in all their Expences in Government, they are the moſt frugal Oeconomiſts in the World.</q> Frugality, I muſt own, is commendable: But when ſpeaking of Expences of Government, eſpecially at ſuch a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as this, the Inſinuation is very injurious.—Can this officious Mangler of Characters, deny in the Face of his injured Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that this Province, as well as its Neighbours, has generouſly and profuſely contributed to the Expences of Government? Were not their vital Sources drain'd almoſt dry, by Supplies they granted the laſt War?—The ſainting Looks of Commerce, —the tattered Garments of Trade,—and the Complaints of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty in our Streets, muſt ſtrike this invidious Accuſer dumb!</p>
               <p>But perhaps he would be underſtood to mean, that they are ſo in public religious Expences. As for the Non-Epiſcopalians, they may defend themſelves; but quite the contrary is evident from the Conduct of Epiſcopalians. Their Generoſity, in their Contributions for their Clergy, in Support of their Churches, and for charitable Uſes, has ever done them Honour. The Non-Epiſcopalians themſelves, have often teſtified this, by peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:011212_0132_0F862E3D2A120500"/>their Aſſiſtance in many Inſtances; and I doubt not they have ever met with Succeſs.</p>
               <p>Animated with the Spirit of their Church, which teaches them to pray for their "Enemies, Perſecutors, and Slanderers," and that God would "bring all into one Fold, under one Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd," they earneſtly deſire the Converſion of the Heathen to the Knowledge of Jeſus and his Goſpel; they behave with Tenderneſs and Mildneſs to other Denominations; endeavour to calm their Animoſity into Peace; and when their Adverſaries have made frequent Attacks on them, they have paſſed them by for the moſt Part, unnoticed as the Offspring of Spleen, Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or Envy. Satisfied with the Excellence, Purity, and Charity of the Society, of which they are members, they would uphold it with Spirit, but in ſuch a Manner, as not deſignedly to prejudice others.—Convinced of the Advantages reſulting from Confirmation, &amp; an orderly Government of their Churches, —that Epiſcopacy was inſtituted by Chriſt, or his Apoſtles; and that it is moſt conducive to the Preſervation of Harmony, and moſt ſuitable to the conſtitution of the State, they are its ſteady Friends.</p>
               <p>From this Picture of the Generality of American Epiſcopali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, (which, if any Doubt ſhould ariſe of its Reſemblance, may be compared with the Originals) inſtead of being "oppoſed" to an Epiſcopate ſo limited, it is evident they muſt be ſtrenuous Advocates for it, as they will enjoy that Order and Regularity they ſo much eſteem, and thoſe Rites they deem ſo highly bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial, have a Proſpect open'd of that Converſion of the Indians they ſo much deſire; and ſee that Church, they are by Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple attached to, recover'd from that Weakneſs ſhe labours under, for want of a ready Ordination.</p>
               <p>I think it almoſt needleſs, to take Notice of the palpable Miſrepreſentations in the remaining Part of this and the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Paragraph: And indeed, to expoſe every "Aberration" in this Paper, would be to cleanſe an Augean Stable Tho' the Epiſcopalians in Virginia "pay not a blind Devotion to their Clergy," the leaſt Counties have two, and moſt of them three Churches; and their Clergymen are ſupported in a genteel Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſuperior to what the Non-Epiſcopal Clergy are, in moſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. As to the Epiſcopalians reſiſting hitherto "the Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the lower Clergy, and the Influence of the right Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Bench in Behalf of an American Biſhop."—"That our Exemption is occaſioned by the Diſcountenances an Epiſcopate hath ſteadily received from the Epiſcopalians themſelves,"— they muſt be thrown into the large Heap of thoſe improbable and unprov'd Affirmations, which are <hi>vox &amp; preterca nihil.</hi>

               <p>The Conduct of the Clergy in this Affair, has been, agreeable to their Duty, and well pleaſing to the Government: And they may flatter themſelves with a ſucceſsful Accompliſhment of their Plan, from the gracious Reception of their Petitions, and the Approbation of their Superiors. As "to the Umbrage" this Connoiſſeur in Politics ſuppoſes "the Government and Biſhop of will take at their Proceedings.—I could whiſper ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in his Ear,—but it might endanger his burſting with that Spleen, with which he is already ſo violently diſtended!</p>
               <p>I cannot help remarking, Sir, in my Way, the malevolent Stroke he aims at the Conventions of the Epiſcopal Clergy; not that I doubt of their being approved of by the Biſhop of London, and every Friend of Chriſtianity; (I know they are) but as it ſerves undeniably to prove, that the Enemies of the Church will ſhut up every Source of Succour from her, and remain unſatisfied till they have levell'd her with the Ground.</p>
               <p>The next Proof of his Aſſertion, he endeavours to draw from the Nature of the Deſence made by the Advocates for a Biſhop.—If the abler Sons of the Church have hitherto neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to appear in print, it is becauſe they perceive nothing as yet offer'd worthy an Anſwer; that they are averſe to entering in ſuch a Manner into a Controverſy, with an Author, ſo entirely regardleſs of his Reputation: And laſtly, they would refrain till their Opponents have ſhewn their true Aim.

               <p>DOCTOR Chandler, having in his firſt ſection, repreſented the biſhops of the church of England, as being Apoſtles; proceeds in his next, to point out thoſe powers which are inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable from, and peculiar to the office. Under this head, the public to whom he appeals, might reaſonably have expected, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſcriptural repreſentation of thoſe peculiar gifts and powers, by which the twelve Apoſtles of our Lord were at that time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed from all other officers in the Chriſtian church. And had he collected his account from the New Teſtament; he muſt have repreſented their diſtinguiſhing qualifications, to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in, "Their being choſen witneſſes of Chriſt to the world, —their being ſent forth to publiſh his goſpel, and erect his church among all mankind.—Their being furniſhed for this work, by the infallible guidance, and miraculous gift of the Holy Spirit; together with a power of conveying ſuch gifts of the Spirit as the Holy Ghoſt (not the Apoſtles themſelves) tho't proper, to the converts to Chriſtianity, by the laying on of their hands. It is by theſe things, and theſe only, that the Apoſtles are diſtinguiſhed from other officers in the church, in the New-Teſtament. But inſtead of this ſcriptural deſcription of the apoſtolic office, the Dr. has arbitrarily aſſigned ſuch peculiar prerogatives, as are at this day claimed by the preſent new-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deled ſet of Apoſtles in the church of England, viz. <hi>government,
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:011212_0133_0F862E3DE3719FA8"/>ordination,</hi> and <hi>confirmation.</hi> It may be true what the Dr. ſays, in p. 15. "In the Chriſtian church, the Apoſtles were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with this power (of government) by Chriſt; as it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for perpetual uſe, they conveyed it to their ſucceſſors."— But his next aſſertion is couched in ſuch ambiguous expreſſions, as ſeem deſigned to deceive the incautious reader. This power he ſays, "was exerciſed by Timothy at Epheſus, by Titus at Crete, by Dyoniſius the Areopagite at Athens, by Epaphroditus at Philippi, by Archippus at Coloſſe, &amp;c." Here the Dr. in order to have been conſiſtent with himſelf, ought to have ſhewn, that Timothy, Titus, Dyoniſius, &amp;c. were real Apoſtles, and did exerciſe the power of government in the church, by virtue of their ſucceſſion in the apoſtolic office, conſidered as diſtinct from, and ſuperior to other officers in the church. Without this all his pretended argumentation on this head, is mere tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling. He well knows, that government in the church, is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally allowed to be of divine appointment; and that it is to be exerciſed by the appointed officers in the church. But if he would prove any thing to his purpoſe, he muſt prove, that church government is to be exerciſed by none but ſuch as are properly ſtiled Apoſtles, and that his biſhops are ſuch.—Had he been conſiſtent, he muſt have ſaid that Timothy, Titus, Dyoniſius, &amp;c. were as really Apoſtles as Paul himſelf was. But had he ſaid this, every common ready would have ſeen the falſehood of his aſſertion, and the weakneſs of his argument. For every one who reads the Bible, muſt know, not only that theſe men were never once ſtiled <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the ſcripture, but that they have not one of thoſe qualifications aſcribed to them, which were peculiar to the Apoſtles, as ſuch. And the Doctor's own repreſentation, is a flat contradiction to that on which the whole ſtreſs of his argument depends. For the Apoſtles as ſuch, had the whole world for their charge; they had a right to exerciſe their apoſtolick power, wherever they went. It was not the deſign of their office, to fix themſelves down in a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular biſhopric, and act as Apoſtles there, and no where elſe. But Timothy, Titus, Dyoniſius, &amp;c. whom the Dr. would have us believe were really Apoſtles, are repreſented, as being fixed down in their reſpective places, to exerciſe their apoſtolick power only in ſuch places. And altho' to an attentive reader, he evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently contradicts the notion of their being Apoſtles; yet he hereby craſtily metamorphoſes the apoſtolick office to make it harmonize with the ſtate of the biſhops of the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, who are fixed down in their reſpective biſhopricks, whom he ridiculouſly repreſents as clad with the apoſtolick character and authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="unknown:011212_0134_0F862E3EACB26200"/>After this ambiguous and falacious repreſentation, our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellant proceeds to lay down, this very remarkable aſſertion, "The biſhop may communicate this power, in ſome degree, to Preſbyters or others, as he ſhall think proper; but in ſuch caſes it muſt be exerciſed in ſubordination to him." A truly ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing claim of power this! "The biſhop may communicate this power in ſome degree,—as he ſhall think proper." If this is the caſe, then the biſhop may communicate one degree of this power to one, and another to another: And by this means, may introduce as many different orders into the church, veſted with different degrees of power, <hi>as he ſhall think proper.</hi> It is well known, that the Pope claims this power of office-making in the church: But I believe, Dr. Chandler is the firſt proteſtant wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter who has claimed it as the right of an Engliſh biſhop. It is a pity, he has not told us preciſely what degree of this power, the Apoſtle Paul communicated to Timothy, to Titus, to Dyoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius, &amp;c. whether he communicated the ſame degree of power to them all; or one degree of it to one, and another Degree to another.—But be that as it will: yet, if theſe degrees of power, communicated by the biſhop to preſbyters and others, are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as he ſhall think proper, then the public is to hear no more of the three orders, of biſhops, prieſts and deacons, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſet in the church by <hi>divine appointment.</hi> For the Dr. tells us, that theſe ſeveral powers, are as the biſhop <hi>ſhall think pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi> Thus he boldly rejects the <hi>darling trinity</hi> of his brethren.</p>
               <p>Again, there is ſomething peculiarly remarkable in theſe words, <hi>As he ſhall think proper,</hi> as they ſtand in connection with the reſt of the ſentence. Proteſtants have commonly held, that the degree of power, communicated to any one in the church, was to be determined by the form of words, and the ſacred rites uſed in his inveſtiture. But the Doctor tells us, the degree of power is to be determined by the biſhop's ſecret inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>as he ſhall think proper.</hi> It is well known, what great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits have been made of this principle, by the popiſh clergy:— But it is really ſurpriſing, that a proteſtant divine; yea, and a Doctor of divinity, ſhould undertake to re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſtabliſh ſuch explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſentiments.</p>
               <p>Let it be further remarked, that the Dr. here tells us, the biſhop may communicate this power, in ſome degree of it, to preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and others. He has not told us, who or what theſe others are beſides preſbyters, to whom the biſhop many communicate of his power. Thoſe indeed, who are acquainted with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the epiſcopal church, need be at no loſs in determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who are thoſe others here intended. It is well known, that beſides the clergy, there is a long liſt of lay-officers belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:011212_0134_0F862E3EACB26200"/>to their ſpiritual courts: Their lay-chancellors, commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, proctors, &amp;c. to whom the biſhop communicates ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of his power. But let me remind this advocate for the epiſcopal church, that the public to whom he appeals, has juſt reaſon to expect that he ſhould ſhew ſome ſcripture warrant for the biſhop, in his parcelling out theſe ſeveral degrees of his power, received from Chriſt, among his own creatures, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants and favourites.</p>
               <p>The Dr. has peremptorily declared, that no ſuch thing as ſpiritual courts, are to be erected by biſhops in America. But what ſecurity can be give to the public, that no ſuch courts ſhall be erected by the biſhop when he comes? For he here ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly aſſerts, that the biſhop may communicate this power, in ſome degree, to preſbyters and others, as he ſhall think proper. If therefore, theſe communications of power, are to be as the biſhop ſhall think proper; I demand, in the name of common ſenſe, how this gentleman can pretend to know, that the biſhop ſhall not think proper to erect his ſpiritual courts among us; or by what logic he will convince mankind that no ſuch thing is intended.</p>
               <p>There is one paſſage more in this remarkable ſentence, that ſtill remains to be conſidered. The Dr. tells us, <q>The biſhop may communicate this power,—but in ſuch caſes, it muſt be exerciſed in ſubordination to him, &amp;c.</q> Is this then really the caſe, in the church of England, that the biſhop only, acts in ſubordination to Chriſt; but all others that are veſted with eccleſiaſtical authority, act in ſubordination to the biſhop? Hence then, we have no longer reaſon to think it ſtrange, that an oath of canonical obedience to the biſhop and his ſucceſſors, ſhould be exacted of every one, at the time of his receiving <hi>holy orders.</hi> According to this repreſentation, the Dr. himſelf is not a miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt; but of the biſhop, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to him ſome degree of his power.</p>
               <p>He further adds, that the biſhop "can never diveſt himſelf of his controuling and ſuperintending authority. It is ſo eſſential to his office, that he cannot relinquiſh it in ſuch a manner, as not to be accountable for the exerciſe of it." And yet, how notorious is it, that the judges in the biſhops court, act in many caſes directly contrary to the mind of the Biſhops? It ſeems however, that theſe ſpiritual-court officers, have nothing to ſear from the expectation of an after-reckoning, becauſe not they, but the biſhop it ſeems, muſt be accountable for their conduct.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, there is but little reaſon to expect, that the public will be much enamoured with the government of the church, as it is exerciſed by theſe Anglican Apoſtles, whoſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:011212_0135_0F862E3F6BF29C40"/>to America, is ſo earneſtly deſired. The other two peculiar and diſtinguiſhing qualifications of the Doctor's Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, are ordination and confirmation. The laſt of theſe, has already been fully conſidered; and I flatter myſelf, in the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of every impartial reader, clearly confuted. The other I ſhall make the ſubject of ſome future paper; aſſuring the Dr. that no part of his Appeal in which he has even attempted to reaſon, ſhall be paſſed over without a ſerious examination, which it is hoped, will convince him, that his triumph in his advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the publication of the firſt number of the American Whig, which tho' it treated with ridicule, ſuch parts of his boaſted performance, as were really <hi>ridiculous,</hi> and conſequently not the ſubject of argument, promiſed at the ſame time, "fully to conſider every part of the pamphlet, that reſpects the merits of the cauſe;" this I ſay, 'tis to be hoped will convince him, that his triumph was really puerile and premature, and ought to teach him to be leſs impatient of contradiction, eſpecially after inviting, not to ſay challenging the whole world to make their objections.</p>
               <p>When I have refuted every part of this dangerous ſophiſtical and jeſuitical pamphlet, I ſhall proceed to give a full reply, to the ſcurrilous vindication of the Biſhop of Landaff's ſermon, which is generally ſuppoſed to be the joint fabrication of the convention, and to be prefaced by the Rev. Mr. Inglis, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto doubtleſs lawfully <hi>conventionated,</hi> as being the moſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, (after the candid and moderate Dr. Chandler) of the whole fraternity.</p>

               <p>THE profeſſed Deſign on which the American Whig ſet out, "was, to confute Dr. Chandler'. Appeal." How far, and how often he hath wandered from this Point, deviating into the Bye paths of Defamation, muſt be evident to all his unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced Readers. His di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But even this Kind of Confutation, ſuch as it is, takes up the ſmalleſt Part of his Papers.

Perhaps he may think that by protracting the Controverſy thus, he will frighten or tire the Friends of the Church and of religious Liberty. But in this he will find himſelf miſtaken. I hope the Public will pardon me, if in following the Whig I ſhould degreſs from what is properly the S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="264" facs="unknown:011212_0137_0F862E40F27B9580"/>than ſuch as the ſaid Appeal has ſpecified. The Whig has not yet produced the leaſt Shadow of Proof to the contrary. He has publiſhed Letters which he ſays were written by Miſſionaries and other Members of the Church, to their Friends, where we may naturally ſuppoſe they freely declare their Sentiments.— he is buſy in queſt of Intelligence by every Method his fertile <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>magination can ſuggeſt: Yet nothing has yet appeared to ſhew that Churchmen have applied for, or deſire a Biſhop veſted with any Powers but thoſe which are purely ſpiritual. Such a Biſhop they want,—ſuch only they have applied for.</p>
               <p>Dr. Chandler, willing to obviate every Objection to an Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Epiſcopate that had the leaſt Colour of Reaſon; ſtates the following.—<q>Another Objection has been made by ſome, to the following Purport; That if Biſhops are once ſettled in America, although in the Manner we now propoſe, there will probably be an Augmentation of their Power, as ſoon as Circumſtances will admit of it: And what is eaſy and inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive in its Beginning, may become burthenſome and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive in the End.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And then adds,—<q>But at this Rate, there can be no End of objecting. For if every poſſible ill Effect of a Thing, although confeſſedly proper in itſelf and harmleſs in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Tendency, may be made an Argument againſt it, there is nothing that can eſcape. Appeal p. 109.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Doctor proceeds to ſhew that Objections of this Sort may as fairly be alledged againſt a religious Toleration,—againſt reading the Scriptures, or a learned Education. Each of theſe is liable to be abuſed, and is often <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ttended with ſome bad Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: Yet Proteſtants in general agree that theſe are upon the Whole uſeful and neceſſary, and ſuch as every Chriſtian has an undoubted Right to. The natural Inference from all which is this, That the ill Effects which ſome may be pleaſed to think will probably attend the ſending Biſhops to America, veſted only, with ſpiritual Powers, can be no juſt Objection againſt this Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; eſpecially when their Apprehenſions on this Head are to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally devoid of any Foundation, and it is improbable in the higheſt Degree that any ſuch Effects will follow.</p>
               <p>The American Whig No. XVI, hath taken the Paſſage above quoted from the Appeal, into his moſt critical Conſideration. However, he does not offer a Syllable that will invalidate this Inference. He rings the Changes on the Words probable and poſſible, till he becomes moſt tedious, diſguſting and unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. He inſinuates that Dr. Chandler in his anſwer to the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, ſubſtituted the Word <hi>poſſible,</hi> in the Place of <hi>probable,</hi>
                  <pb n="265" facs="unknown:011212_0137_0F862E40F27B9580"/>to evade the Force of the Argument. But every Perſon of the leaſt Diſcernment, muſt perceive that the Doctor, when he uſed the Word <hi>probable,</hi> put it in the Mouth of the ſuppoſed Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor: When he uſed the Word <hi>poſſible,</hi> he ſpeaks in his own Name. The ill Effects which in the Objection are ſuppoſed to be probable, he denies to be ſuch, but barely poſſible only; and juſtly obſerves from thence, <q>That if every poſſible ill Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of a Thing, although confeſſedly proper in itſelf and harmleſs in its natural Tendency, may be made an Argument againſt it, there is nothing that can eſcape." The Doctor aſſerts that the "propoſed Epiſcopate has a natural Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to produce no ill Conſequences,</q> ſuch as are alledged in the Objection. If he thought ſo for good Reaſon, and that thoſe ill Effects which the Objector ſuppoſed probable, were barely poſſible, had he not a Right to ſay ſo? Evidently, there is in this no "Sophiſtry," no "Artifice," with which the Whig very decently charges him. The Reaſoning is concluſive, the Inference is juſt.</p>
               <p>Dr. Chandler is fully able to vindicate himſelf, and doubtleſs will do ſo at a proper Seaſon. In the mean Time, I will here briefly ſhew the Improbability that the ill Effects, implied in the Objection, (and which are haſhed up and dealt out weekly to the Public by the American Whig) will accompany the propoſed Epiſcopate. The ill Effects are, Spiritual Courts, the Inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Biſhops with temporal Power, taxing the Colonies for their Support, and paying Tythes. Now that theſe Conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will attend an American Epiſcopate, or that theſe Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages will be annexed to the Epiſcopal Office, either when Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops are firſt ſent to America, or in any future Time, is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable to the laſt Degree,—ſo far as human Foreſight can reach, I might ſay impoſſible; and this for the following plain, evident Reaſons.—</p>
               <p n="1">1. BECAUSE it is diametrically oppoſite to the Plan on which it hath been ever propoſed that Biſhops ſhould be ſent to Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. Several of the Society's Abſtracts as early as the Beginning of the preſent Century mention this Propoſal for fixing Biſhops in the Colonies. <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>The Readers may ſee Extracts to this Purpo, taken out of the Society's Abſtracts for the Years</hi> 1712 <hi>and</hi> 1714, <hi>in Dr. Chandler's Appeal, P.</hi> 49—51, <hi>in the Notes.</hi>
                  </note> The Public hath ſeen Biſhop Butler's Scheme, drawn up Ann. Dom. 1750, in the Vindication of the Biſhop of Landaff's Sermon, in anſwer to Mr. Livingſton, p. 67. The Plan drawn up by Dr. Chandler in his Appeal, p. 79. which the Reader will find printed in Italics, is perfectly ſimilar to one
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:011212_0138_0F862E41AF7AE458"/>that is propoſed in a Pamphlet, entitled, An Anſwer to Dr. May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hew's Obſervations on the Society's Charter, and now generally known to have been written by the late excellent Arch-biſhop Secker. In each of theſe, and many others I could mention, thoſe Temporal Powers, Spiritual Courts, Taxes and Tythes are utterly diſclaimed, and no Powers are propoſed to be given to American Biſhops, but ſuch as are purely ſpiritual, viz. To ordain and ſuperintend the Clergy, and confirm ſuch as chooſe that Ordinance.</p>
               <p n="2">2. BECAUSE in all the late Applications to England for an Epiſcopate, none but ſuch a primitive Biſhop as I have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is propoſed or deſired. I have been lately favoured with a Sight of the ſeven Petitions or Addreſſes to our Superiors at Home, ſo famous in the Annals of American Whiggiſm; and I here declare in the Words of Truth and Sincerity, that there is not in any of them ſo much as a diſtant Hint deſiring Biſhops, veſted with thoſe Powers and Appendages, mentioned by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of an American Epiſcopate. On the contrary, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply only for Biſhops veſted with the Power of ordaining and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the Clergy, and adminiſtring Confirmation. They on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire that the Inconveniencies with regard to theſe Points, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from the Want of Biſhops may be removed; that Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may be put on an equal Footing with other Denominations, and enjoy equal Privileges; which cannot be the Caſe, unleſs Biſhops are ſent to America.</p>
               <p n="3">3 BECAUSE all the Members of the Church, to a Man, are ſo far from deſiring, that they are extremely averſe to our hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Biſhop veſted with temporal Powers, and thoſe Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dages beforementioned. They are convinced, that ſuch a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure would injure the Church—would probably produce as many Inconveniences to it, as the primitive Biſhop they deſire will aſſuredly bring real <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>dvantages. This ſingle Conſideration is ſufficient to determine the Judgment of all the Members and Friends of the Church, beſides their being as faſt Friends to every Species of Liberty, religious or civil, as any Diſſenters that exiſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. BECAUSE the Proviſion made for an American Epiſcopate, clearly evinces, that no other than the primitive Biſhop ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the Appeal, was or is intended for America, Archbiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op Tenniſon, left One Thouſand Pounds, for the Support of one or more American Biſhops. Arch-biſhop Secker, a few Months ago, left an equal Sum for the ſame Purpoſe, to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion no more ſuch Legacies. But why theſe Donations to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Biſhops here, if it were intended that they ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by a Tax on the Colonies, by Tythes, or the Fees ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from Spiritual Courts? The American Whig himſelf will
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:011212_0138_0F862E41AF7AE458"/>not, I preſume, have the Face to ſay, that theſe two eminent Prelates were not fully acquainted with the Plan of an Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Epiſcopate. Why then would they throw away their Eſtates unneceſſarily to ſupport thoſe Biſhops, if another Fund was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended here for their Support! Would it not have been abſurd to the laſt Degree? The Reader may reſt aſſured, there never was any Deſign formed of impoſing ſuch Taxes and Tythes, or of erecting ſuch ſpiritual Courts.</p>
               <p>Had the American Whig lived when the Society for propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Goſpel in foreign Parts was incorporated, and was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding Miſſionaries to be ſent to the Colonies, he might have inveighed with equal Plauſibility againſt that Meaſure, as againſt ſending Biſhops at this Time. How eloquently might he have expatiated on the many ill Effects which would probably ariſe from our having ſo many Zealots of the Gown fixed here— That however ſpecious or harmleſs the Plan might be repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by prieſtly Craft, by the guilty Contrivers of the Plot: Yet the true Deſign was to ſubjugate the Colonies to Clerical Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion—to impoſe Taxes and Tythes for the Support of thoſe Miſſionaries, and erect ſpiritual Courts to harraſs and plague the good People of America.</p>
               <p>All this, and much more in the ſame <hi>dulcet</hi> Strain, which flows in ſuch Abundance from the mellifluous Pen of our Whig, might he have urged againſt the Importation of thoſe "ſpiritual Carnalities" the Miſſionaries. And what Anſwer could the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety return to this Kind of Argumentation but the following? That their ſole Deſign was to ſupply thoſe People with Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who were deſtitute of the Ordinances of Religion— that the Collections made by the Society, the Donations and Legacies of its members, and of other pious Perſons, to ſupply a Fund for the Support of the Miſſionaries, fully evinced that they did not intend the Impoſition of Tythes, or any Tax what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever on the Coloniſts, for the Miſſionaries. This anſwer would have been ſatisfactory then to every unprejudiced, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Perſon; and the Experience of more than ſixty Years demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates it was the Truth.</p>
               <p>The Caſe is perfectly ſimiliar at preſent. The ſame Anſwer will ſerve to confute the falſe Suggeſtions of the Whig, and his Aſſociates, concerning an American Epiſcopate, The ſole De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Society, and other Members of the Church, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that Meaſure, is to remove the Inconveniencies we now labour under, thro' Want of Biſhops, with Regard to Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuperintending the Clergy, and Confirmation. The Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Legacies to raiſe a Fund to ſupport American Biſhops, fully evince no other Fund is propoſed, no tax upon the Coloniſts
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:011212_0139_0F862E42718E0130"/>intended; and that the Outcry now raiſed about Taxes, Tythes and ſpiritual Courts, is entirely groundleſs—utterly void of any juſt Foundation.</p>
               <p n="5">5. And laſtly, Becauſe the Spirit of the Times is ſuch as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines People rather to abridge, than add to the Power of the Clergy, both in England and America. It is really pleaſant to obſerve to what an Heighth the Whig raiſes the eccleſiaſtical Power, if a Biſhop ſhould ſet his Foot on this Continent. He makes him a mere Coloſſus, that would beſtride this whole weſtern World, and ſeize in an Inſtant all Power, civil and military, as well as ſpiritual. I am ſometimes tempted to think the poor Whig is haunted with Biſhops as with Spectres,—that he nods, and is carried back in his Dreams to thoſe monkiſh Times, when Superſtition bore Sway, and People were for giving up every Thing into the Hands of the Mother Church.</p>
               <p>But ſurely he muſt dream, or worſe than dream, who repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents this Humour as prevailing in our Day; or would inſinuate that there is any Proſpect of it. Any Attempt in Eccleſiaſtics to encroach on the Rights of others, would not fail of being inſtantly cruſhed here or elſewhere in the Britiſh Dominions; nor would any be more ready to aſſiſt in doing ſo, than the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church. But it would be injurious and falſe to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the American Clergy had any ſuch Deſign. Their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters are well known; nor are there any warmer Advocates for the Rights and Liberties of their Fellow Subjects among us.</p>
               <p>Theſe Particulars, to which many more might be added, duly conſidered, will ſerve to convince every unprejudiced Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that no Biſhop is deſired on any other Plan than what is mentioned in Dr. <hi>Chandler's Appeal.</hi>—That the Alarms which are ſounded in our Ear by the <hi>Whig's brazen</hi> Trumpet, as if Taxes and Tythes, and Spiritual Courts awaited us, are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether groundleſs,—and that Churchmen in deſiring Biſhops, deſire nothing but their Right, and what every other Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation among us enjoys. Whether the <hi>Whig's</hi> Conduct proceeds from Malice, or from a diſtempered, heated Imagination, I will not take upon me to determine. Sure I am, to ſpeak in the moſt charitable Terms, it muſt proceed from a miſguided Zeal, —"Zeal which is not according to Knowledge."</p>

               <head>From Mr. PARKER'S GAZETTE, Nov. 14. The AMERICAN WHIG. [No. XXXVI.]</head>
               <p>THE new ſcheme of converting the Anglican Biſhops into Apoſtles, has been of great ſervice to Dr. Chandler, in various parts of his Appeal. And that nothing might be wanting in his dignified prelates, to anſwer this high and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable title; he has ſtrip'd the apoſtolic character of all thoſe divine gifts and qualifications, by which the twelve Apoſtles of our Lord were diſtinguiſhed in the primitive church; and made it to conſiſt only in having the power of government, ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and confirmation.</p>
               <p>It is the Doctor's repreſentation of the power of ordination, as being one diſtinguiſhing property of the Apoſtle's character, that falls under the preſent conſideration.</p>
               <p>The Dr. enters upon this part of his ſubject, by enquiring, "To whom can the appointment of inferior and ſubordinate officers belong, in every ſociety, but to thoſe who govern it?" Here we have another ſpecimen of his peculiar ſtrength of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning; which is not to prove his point, but to beg the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It belongs to him firſt to prove, that inferior and ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>r<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate officers in the Chriſtian church, have been appointed by Chriſt. But by his uſual logick, he takes it for granted, that there are ſuch underſtrappers in the church of Chriſt; and then, with an air of aſſurance, enquires, to whom the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them ſhould belong, but to thoſe who have the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. The whole force of his argument depends upon that which he had before aſſerted, under the preceding head of government, where he proves, in direct oppoſition to both reaſon and ſcripture, by the mere authority of his own <hi>ipſe dixit,</hi> that "The Biſhop may communicate this power, in ſome degree, to Preſbyters and others, as he ſhall think proper." It is by this almightineſs of the Biſhop's communicative power, that he can create as many inferior and ſubordinate officers in the church as he pleaſeth, by communicating this power to one and another, in ſuch different degrees as he ſhall think proper. And from this inexhauſtible fountain it is, (not from any ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural precept, precedent or example,) that theſe inferior and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate officers in the church, ſtart into being. And as this regiment of ſubalterns, which come not in by the door, but climb up ſome other way, owe their exiſtence and prerogatives to modern epiſcopacy; I ſhall leave the Doctor and his brethren to marſhal them, in their ſeveral ranks of ſeniority and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:011212_0140_0F862E4323C75128"/>But if he means thereby to wheedle us out of our ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural right of chooſing, and appointing our own miniſters, I muſt tell him, that the public will require ſome better evidence, that his Biſhops are really Apoſtles, than any that he, or his party, have hitherto produced, before they will conſent, that his Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ops ſhould appoint them. However, we may here ſee a door opened, by the intended importation of Biſhops, for our making uſe of our idle pence, as all thoſe inferior and ſubordinate offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers muſt have their ſhare for a maintainance, as well as my Lord Biſhop.</p>
               <p>As a further argument, the Dr. adds, "The ſame argument which proves the diſtinction of Biſhops from Preſbyters, proves alſo that ordination is an office peculiar to the former; for it is chiefly by the appropriation of offices, that we are able to prove the diſtinction of orders." The ſame logick ſtill! It is here again taken for granted, that the ſcripture appropriates certain offices, to particular officers in the church; which is the thing to be proved. But let us conſider this, which he ſays, is his chief argument. He ſays, it is proved, that there are different orders in the goſpel miniſtry, becauſe there are different parts of the miniſterial work appointed; as if it were abſurd to ſuppoſe, that the ſame officer might perform the whole work. And again, ſome particular parts of the miniſterial work, are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to ſome particular officers in the church, as appears from there being different orders in the miniſtry, ſome ſuperior, ſome inferior, which ſhews, that all are not to perform the ſame ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.—Thus the Dr. alternately proves the one by the other, or as the Logicians call it, argues in a circle. Let us however, conſider what proof he lays before us, of this appropriation of officers to the different orders in the goſpel-miniſtry. And here, the ſubject he is upon, requires that he ſhould inſiſt upon the power of ordination, as being peculiarly appropriated to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular order, viz. Apoſtles. Now all accounts of ordination, to be collected from the ſcripture, are theſe: The ordination of Paul and Barnabas.—The Elders ordained by theſe two Apoſtles, in the churches which they planted.—The ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Timothy.—And the ordinations performed by Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and Titus. Theſe are all the ordinations the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment mentions. As to the firſt of thoſe, viz. the ordination of Paul and Barnabas, the Dr. will not allow them to be ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And why? Not becauſe all the parts proper and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to an ordination, were not performed; but becauſe it was performed, not by Apoſtles, but by certain prophets and teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the church at Antioch. The appropriation of the power of ordination to Apoſtles only, is here evidently made, not by the ſcripture, but by Dr. Chandler.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="271" facs="unknown:011212_0140_0F862E4323C75128"/>As to the power of Barnabas and Paul, to ordain Elders in the churches which they planted, none will deny it. But then, I demand where he finds this power appropriated to them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were Apoſtles? If the churches which they planted, had Elders ordained in them, that ſervice muſt be performed by them, for this plain reaſon, that there was no body elſe there to do it.—But what evidence does this afford, that the power of ordination was peculiar to them?</p>
               <p>Again, Timothy and Titus, had directions given them for ordaining, and they doubtleſs did ordain; and there is as much to be ſaid of the power of ordination being appropriated to them, as to Paul and Barnabas. But here, Reverend Doctor, flinch not; but ſpeak full to the caſe. Will you aſſert that Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy and Titus, were as truly Apoſtles as Paul and Barnabas were? Should you aſſert that they were really Apoſtles, in the proper ſcriptural ſenſe of the word, you know that the public, to whom you have appealed, will laugh you to ſcorn. But if you inſiſt, that they were not Apoſtles, you give up your whole argument, about the appropriation of the power of ordination. How does it appear that the other Apoſtles, James, Peter, &amp;c. had the power of ordination, ſince there is no mention made in the ſcripture, that they ever did ordain? Or how does it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the Elders which Timothy and Titus ordained, had not the power of ordination committed to them, as well as the other branches of the miniſterial work? The ſilence of the ſcripture about it, is no evidence at all in the caſe. What hint is there in the whole ſacred canon, that the power of ordination is appropriated to any particular order? Yea, is not the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the ſcripture, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll in oppoſition to theſe appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting notions? For the ordinations mentioned in the ſcripture, were performed, ſome by Apoſtles, ſome by Preſbyters and Teachers, ſome by Evangeliſts, and ſome by the laying on of the hands of the Preſbyters. Upon the whole then, all that does, or can appear from the ſcripture, is no more than this: "That it is by the religious rite of ordination, that a man becomes veſted with miniſterial authority." But as to the power of ordination, being appropriated to a particular ſuperior order; it is ſo far from being countenanced by the ſcripture, that it is contrary to the ſcripture-repreſentations, to ſuppoſe, that there is more than one order in the goſpel miniſtry.</p>
               <p>Thus then it appears, that what the Dr. pretends to be the chief argument to prove the diſtinction of Biſhops from Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, is a mere empty ſophiſtical flouriſh of words, fraught with ſound, but deſtitute of ſenſe, extracted from the very dregs of that unſcriptural, abſurd, antichriſtian, papiſtical dogma, "That
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:011212_0141_0F862E45A1FCE1C8"/>the Biſhop may communicate his power, in ſome degree, to Preſbyters and others, as he ſhall think proper."</p>
               <p>The Dr. proceeds to add, "Becauſe ſome eccleſiaſtical offices, are never performed by the clergy in common, but only by ſuch of them as are particularly ordained for thoſe purpoſes, it is evident that thoſe who are thus ordained and empowered, are admitted to a different and higher order." The ſame logick ſtill. A mere barefaced begging of the queſtion. Where does he find theſe particular ordinations? He ſtill treads the ſame circle; alternately proving the one by the other. I muſt here enquire, were the Apoſtles thus particularly ordained for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of ordination? If ſo, how came Timothy and Titus who were not Apoſtles, to have this power? Or, was Timothy parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly ordained to this office? If ſo, how does it appear? The Dr. will perhaps ſay, that Timothy did ordain, and therefore had the power of ordination committed to him. But this is nothing to the purpoſe.—The thing to be proved, is, that there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing peculiar in Timothy's ordination, empowering him to ordain others, which was not common to the ordination of every Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Here the Dr. can have no evaſion, but only his former dogma. "That the Biſhop may communicate his power in ſome degree, to Preſbyters and others, as he ſhall think proper." But I aſk, who ſays the Biſhop may do this? Does the ſcripture ſay ſo? Or has there ever been any body who ſaid it, beſides Dr. Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler and the Pope?</p>

               <p>THERE is an unhappy Perverſeneſs in the Diſpoſition of ſome Men, which will never ſuffer them to be contented themſelves, and engages them to diſturb the Peace of others. The moſt beautiful Syſtems either appear diſagreeable to them or they endeavour to repreſent them ſo to others. In ſome Meaſure they ſeem to claim the Pity, but in a greater to deſerve the Indignation of good Men. The American Whig
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:011212_0142_0F862E466DD82520"/>appears to be of this Character, from his Productions, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially from his 17th Numb, wherein he aims a Blow at that Pillar of the Conſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uction the Fall of which, he muſt be conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous would be attended with the moſt fatal Conſequences. <q>The Church of England (ſays Dr. Chandler,) in its external Polity, is ſo happily connected and interwoven with the civil Conſtitution, that each mutually ſupports and is ſupported by the other.</q> Againſt this Poſition he levels his Paper; I ſhall therefore offer in this Day's Lucubration, ſome Arguments in its Defence, and draw them from that Repreſentation of the external Polity of the Church of England, given us by the Whig in the Paper under Conſideration. <q>If the State (ſays he) derives Happineſs and Support from the Church, or if the civil Conſtitution harmonizes with it, this Happineſs, this Support, this Harmony, muſt be evinced in one or more of the following Particulars. Firſt, That the King is, by Law, the ſupreme Head of the Anglican Church. Secondly, That he has the Appointment of all the Spiritual Lords in the Realm. Thirdly, That thoſe Lords make a Part of the Legiſlature of Great-Britain. Fourthly, That they are au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized to hold ſpiritual Courts in England, for puniſhing Offenders againſt the Eccleſiaſtical Law. Fifthly, That the King has Authority <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o ſummon the Convocation, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to make Canons.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe I ſhall conſider in Succeſſion, as they are plac'd. Firſt, The King's Supremacy is a Prerogative right in itſelf, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to the State. 'Tis a juſt Privilege reſulting from the Alliance between Church and State The civil Magiſtrate, for the Benefit of the Common Wealth, deſir'd an Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and the Church. To effect this, the Church deprived herſelf of her natural Independency, and relied on the Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the State, which was due to her for the Advantages which it would receive from her Influence in its Favour: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently the civil Magiſtrate muſt have a juſt Superiority, as that which protects is always more powerful than that which is protected. This Prerogative is alſo both juſt and beneficial,— for without it the Form of Government, and the Rules of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, might be altered, and thoſe Doctrines corrupted, for the Sake of which the State entered into this Alliance. As Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in the Opinion of the wiſeſt Legiſlators, is the main Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Government; and as the pureſt, both in external Polity, and internal Structure, is beſt adapted to advance the Intereſts of the State, it follows undeniably that it is an eſſential Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege in the civil Magiſtrate, after he has choſen a Church which he deems pureſt, and on which he has confer'd Powers of being
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:011212_0143_0F862E47B68371C0"/>ſerviceable to continue its Utility, by ſuffering no Alterations to be made without his Conſent.</p>
               <p>By this Prerogative the King is enabled to anſwer the End aimed at by the Aſſociation. He ſees that thoſe Principles are inſtilled into the Minds of the People, which are favourable to Society. He can take care that none ſhall be appointed Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in the Church taken under his Protection, but thoſe who will deliver its Doctrines uncorrupted to his Subjects. Diſorders in Government demand ſpeedy Remedies. Thoſe he could not readily obtain from Religion, if the Church was independent of his Power; but, as its ſupreme Head, he can demand its ſtrongeſt Exertions in the Cauſe of the State, and can himſelf extend their Uſefulneſs. By this conditional Subordinancy of the Clergy, thoſe Evils alſo are avoided, which proceed either from an abſolute State of Dependance, or from an Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency. Abſolute Dependance would make them mere Engines in the Hands of the Prince, and would probably raiſe him to a Tyrant. While from an Independency would ariſe ſuch woful Diſorders as are viſibly attendant on the Papacy, in thoſe King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms where the civil Magiſtrate is a mere Tool to the Church.</p>
               <p>This Prerogative tends likewiſe to create a Reverence and Veneration for the Prince, as Head of two Bodies united, and Defender of their religious as well as civil Privileges: A Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence extremely well adapted to engage his Subjects to a ready and cheerful Obedience. To eſtabliſh a Church without giving the civil Magiſtrate a Supremacy, would be the direct Method of conſtituting an <hi>Imperium in imperio,</hi>—a Charybdis, which every wiſe Common Wealth will avoid, if poſſible.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Equally neceſſary and uſeful is that Branch of the Supremacy, which the Whig next mentions, viz. <q>That the King has the Appointment of all the ſpiritual Lords in the Realm.</q> For ſince He has confer'd Honours and Powers on the Church (in Conſequence of the Union) to make it more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to the State, he ought certainly to be poſſeſs'd of a Power of chooſing thoſe Perſons whom he judges beſt capacitated for the public Good. Not that he has a Power of making Biſhops; for this is inherent in the Church as a religious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; but only of directing where, and by whom, this Office ſhall be exerciſed. By this Means the State is ſecured from the Evils which might flow from the ambitious Intrigues of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; If, independent of the Authority of the King, they could arrogate to themſelves thoſe Powers which were given for the public Service; and inſtead of this Danger, has a Proſpect of ſeeing theſe Offices well fill'd by the Magiſtrates whoſe Aim muſt be ſuppoſed to be the Good of the whole Community.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="277" facs="unknown:011212_0143_0F862E47B68371C0"/>Thirdly, That the Biſhops make a Part of the Legiſlature of Great-Britain, is a Privilege beneficial to the Government, and juſtly claimable by the Church. For ſince, to effect an Union, ſhe has given up her Independency, and ſuffers the State to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide in Affairs relating to her as a Society it is reaſonable that ſhe ſhould have her Agents or Repreſentatives in the Legiſlature, leſt ſhe ſhould ſuffer by her Kindneſs, and Laws be enacted pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to her Intereſts.</p>
               <p>Their Advice and Aſſiſtance in any Thing reſpecting Church Affairs more eſpecially, we cannot but ſuppoſe to be very uſeful and neceſſary; for common Reaſon dictates, that thoſe Men muſt naturally be beſt acquainted with the Affairs, which their Func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions engaged them to ſtudy, and in which they have continually employed themſelves. From this Conjunction of the Lords Spiritual and Tempor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> this Advantage alſo ariſes,—that the People will conſider the Laws as more binding, when enacted by the concurrent Judgment of their religious and civil Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors. Neither do I imagine it would be impolitical to give Prelates a Seat in Parliament, if it were only to ſtrengthen the ſecond Branch of the Legiſlature, which needs confeſſedly their Support. Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e alſo, for this Reaſon, was it to connect the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates and Lords Temporal together, that, in a wicked Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, the Prelates might oppoſe any Meaſures detrimental to the Church, and the others obſtruct any ambitious Schemes of the Clergy.</p>
               <p>The fourth Particular is, That they are authorized to hold Spiritual Courts in England, for puniſhing Offenders againſt the Eccleſiaſtical Law. Spiritual Courts are only formed and employed for the Service of the State. However the Enemies of our happy Conſtitution may harrangue on eccleſiaſtical Power and Tyranny, as if a Dominion was uſurp'd by the Biſhops for their own Purpoſes, it is evident that theſe Courts were eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s an aid to the Civil, to remedy thoſe Evils which the Civil either could not take Cognizance of or could not remove. It is certain a wiſe Legiſlature would not have erected them, if it had not ſuppoſed them beneficial, and it is no leſs certain that Biſhops receive this juridical Authority, not as inherent in their Office, but as a Sword to be wielded in the Cauſe of their Country.</p>
               <p>If they have abuſed their Power, let them be called to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count like other bad Officers of the Common Wealth;—if the Courts themſelves are found to be detrimental to the Public, let them be aboliſhed. But, as it has never yet been propoſed to have any ſuch conſtituted in America, I ſhall diſmiſs the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as altogether impertinent to the Caſe of introducing Biſhops into this Country.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="278" facs="unknown:011212_0144_0F862E4862B091C8"/>Fifthly, What has been ſaid of the King's Supremacy in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, makes it unneceſſary to expatiate on this Branch of it: Suffice it to ſay, that if the King had not a Power of ſummon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Convocation, and permitting them to make Canons, when Accident, Oppoſition, or ſome Circumſtances dangerous to the Church and State, if not obviated, demanded it, his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy would loſe one of its moſt energetic Parts. Add to this, that by a Power of diſſolving when he ſees proper, he can obviate thoſe Diſadvantages reſulting from long, frequent, and controverſial Convocations, which, in many ſuppoſeable Caſes, might be attended with pernicious Conſequences.</p>
               <p>Thus have I briefly enumerated ſome of the Advantages ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and Diſadvantages avoided, by the preſent happy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of Church and State.—The State ſupports and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects the Church, and the Church exerts its ſalutary and moſt effectual Influence in the Service of the State; thus, (agreeable to Dr. Chandler's Problem) <q>They mutually ſupport and are ſupported by each other.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It would take up more Space than the Limits of this Paper allow, to animadvert on all the futile Objections and Miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the tedious Number before me:—However, I hope I have ſufficiently evinced the Truth of the Dr's. Poſition,—To his frequent Aſſertions, "that "The King is abſolute Monarch of the Church." I think no Reply more ſuitable than the Words of the ſage Hooker, who was confeſſedly acquainted intimately with the Laws Civil and Eccleſiaſtical, and had the Honour of the higheſt Commendation from Locke himſelf, that illuſtrious Maſter of reaſoning. <q>Our Laws have with much Certainty preſcribed Bounds into each Kind of Power. All Deciſions of Things doubtful, and Correction of Things amiſs, are proceeded in by order of Law, what Perſon ſoever he be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom the Adminiſtration of Judgment belongeth. It is neither permitted unto Prelates nor Prince to judge and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine at their own Diſcretion, but Law has preſcrib'd what both ſhall do. What Power the King hath, he hath it by Law, the Bounds and Limits of it are known; the entire Community giveth general Order by Law, how all Things publickly are to be done, and the King as the Head, the higheſt in Authority over all, cauſeth according to the ſame Law, every particular to be framed and ordered thereby. The whole Body Politic maketh Laws, which Laws gave Power unto the King; and the King having bound himſelf to uſe according to Law that Power, it ſo falleth out, that the Execution of the one is accompliſhed by the other in moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and peaceable Sort. <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <pb n="279" facs="unknown:011212_0144_0F862E4862B091C8"/>I ſhall finiſh this Paper with a few Obſervations pertinent to the Subject.</p>
               <p>Whoever examines, or even ſuperficially ſurveys and compares the Government of the Church and State, will find a beautiful Harmony and Concordance, ſuch as no other Society can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. The Subordinancy of Powers in each, and the Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance in their three Eſtates, advance a mutual Regard and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and Eſteem in the People for each. The Dignities like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe confer'd on the Biſhops, muſt be very inſtrumental in e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe Principles of Honour which are ſo favourable to a Monarchy. Add to this, that Perſons of the higheſt Rank,— Brothers of Kings, and Noblemen by Birth, have added Luſtre to the Office,—ſo that the moſt eminent Perſonages think it an Honour to them, by entering into this Station, to promote the Intereſt of Religion and their Country. The Preſbyterian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples or Form of Government, cannot, with any Juſtice, be ſet in Competition with it, as they maintain a perfect Equality, and cannot boaſt that Antiquity, or illuſtrious Deſcent, ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and neceſſary to Honour.</p>
               <p>It may be accounted likewiſe no ſmall Teſtimony in favour of the Efficacy of Prelacy in the Engliſh Government, that the Enemies of the State have ever tried to diſparage it; and Oliver Cromwell, (when he aimed at the Deſtruction of Monarchy,) prov'd by his Conduct, that <q>he imagined the Extirpation of Prelacy the ſureſt way to effect his diabolical Purpoſes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is highly neceſſary that a Church which is eſtabliſhed by the State, ſhould have ſettled Articles of Doctrine, Creeds, &amp;c. that the civil Magiſtrate may judge of their Propriety,—that he ſupport not dangerous Principles, and that the People may have a public and uniform Method of Inſtruction. Her public Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip muſt be precompos'd and ſtated, that he may inſpect it, and judge what will be moſt beneficial for the common Weal. To ſuch Methods and Practices the Principles adopted by the Preſbyterians are oppoſite, and thoſe of the Church moſt favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and conſequently it muſt be beſt intitled to an Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the State.</p>
               <p>The Number of Members alſo which the Church compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends in it, renders it more fitting for an Eſtabliſhment. Tho' the motly Troops which gather under the Standard of Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianiſm may now ſeem to be numerous,—yet if it were to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and conſequently certain Principles to be agreed on, thoſe ravenous Devourers, who only join'd with her in her Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the Church, would turn their full-mouth'd Bowlings at her; and ſhe would be left, as in the Times of Oliver, to ceaſe from the Attempt, or be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Very ill therefore does He deſerve of his Country, who not only neglects to pay them that Tribute of Praiſe which their Services demand, but endeavours to rob them of that Share of Acknowledgment which the Public might be diſpos'd to give them.

               <p>SO ſacred are the rights of truth, and of conſcience, that it argues a conſiderable degree of meanneſs of ſpirit, to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late them, even for the preſervation of life itſelf, Nay, to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent things in a jocular romantic way for the diverſion of others, common as it is, among the lower ſort of people, is no ſmall immorality: It diſcovers a trifling temper of mind, with a want of a due tenderneſs of conſcience, a proper regard to truth and religion.—But to aſſert a falſehood with great ſeriouſneſs and ſolemnity, is doubtleſs a notable aggravation of the crime, and renders this ſin, in the beautiful language of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, exceeding ſinful. This practice of deceit and falſhood, is in the meaneſt of men, but is eſteemed more criminal in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of diſtinction and learning. Hence to give ſuch a perſon the lie, is accounted the greateſt indignity and ſeldom fails to kindle a proportionable reſentment.</p>
               <p>A clergyman is conſidered not only as a Man of honour, but of religion and piety; and by his office appointed to reprove the
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:011212_0145_0F862E4F27138E28"/>vices of others, and to be a preacher of truth and righteouſneſs. It muſt therefore be ſtill more atrocious in him to take up the buſineſs of miſrepreſentation and duplicity. So far as any of them are guilty of this ſcandalous offence, they practically deny themſelves to be the miniſters of Chriſt, who is the faithful and true witneſs, and inliſt themſelves under the banners of Satan, who was a liar from the beginning. Hence it is that among the many things which are juſtly looked upon as exceptionable in high church, and her miſſionaries in the colonies, there is none that gives greater offence, and raiſes more diſguſt againſt the prelatical faction, than that want of varacity for which they have rendered themſelves ſo remarkable, and thoſe methods of deceit, miſrepreſentation and calumny, which they too conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purſue.—They may pretend what they will, about hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the power, and being the only miniſters of Chriſt, and greatly zealous for the only church he has in the world: But can any ſober man who really believes the Bible, ſeriouſly think that to be the cauſe and kingdom of Chriſt, which he ſees ſo principally founded in, and conſtantly promoted by impoſition and artifice? Was the religion which the miſſionaries profeſs much more exceptionable than it is, they might notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be juſtly entitled to the charitable opinion of mankind, did they but purſue fair and honeſt meaſures to promote it. But ſince they are guilty of ſuch groſs diſingenuity, in proſecuting their ſcheme, they muſt, to every upright and candid perſon, acquainted with their meaſures, appear in the moſt diſagreeable colours. How inexpreſſibly odious then, muſt be their conduct in the ſight of that God who loves truth and uprightneſs in the inward parts.—Truly affecting muſt it be, to every ſerious perſon to think what account ſuch men will be able to give of their conduct in the great day of judgment, when all their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious diſguiſes and falacious colourings ſhall vaniſh, and the naked truth of things appear.</p>
               <p>The honeſt and intelligent reader, will not I believe, be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at theſe reflections, on the behaviour of the miſſion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

P. 49, 50 In their addreſs made to the Throne at the acceſſion of King GEORGE I. there is this ſurpriſing inducement to en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="282" facs="unknown:011212_0146_0F862E50776DE160"/>ſoon as his royal wiſdom ſhall be apprized, that the inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe people in thoſe regions, (which ſurely is the voice of God in the caſe) concur with the apparent neceſſity, that ſuch governors in the church be there conſtituted.</q> In reading this paſſage would not any man naturally think, that the people in the Britiſh colonies in general, were deſirous of an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican Biſhop? The terms are general and indefinite, "thoſe people in thoſe regions." Not only one region, colony or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, but all in general, Thoſe People in thoſe Regions.</p>
               <p>But was there are any foundation in truth and fact, for ſuch a repreſentation of the inclinations of the Americans? Directly the reverſe. Nothing can be further from the truth, though it was ſigned by the clergy and veſtries, and alſo by ſome governors. For ſome governors have not diſdain'd to become the tools of the epiſcopal clergy, in order to avail themſelves in their turn, of the dirty inſtrumentality of the gown and caſſock. Dr. Chandler and his miſſionary brethren, when it becomes neceſſary for them, to inform their employers how laborious and ſucceſsful they are, frequently repreſent in their letters, the church of England to be in a growing ſtate, and that ſhe has been greatly increaſing; and this I believe, they have conſtantly done both before and ſince the year 1714, when this addreſs was made to the throne. He tells us, p. 88. <q>Whatever notions the Diſſenters in this country may have formerly entertained concerning the church, yet of late years they have greatly come off from their preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices; and ſentiments of candour, charity and moderation, have viſibly taken place.</q>—And yet not withſtanding th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> the prejudices of Diſſenters, as he abſurdly calls them, in the colonies againſt the church of England, are ſo greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, there are but very few in America who deſire a Biſhop at this preſent period. The general aſſemblies of the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts-Bay and Connecticut, which are by far the largeſt of the N England colonies, have inſtructed their Agents to remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate againſt an American epiſcopate. Nor does it appear that the people of the other colonies are more deſirous of ſuch a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Lord to rule over them. It ſhould ſeem from all the public appearances and the beſt intelligence that can be obtained, that there is ſcarcely one in a thouſand of the inhabitants of the Britiſh colonies, who really deſire an American Biſhop. There are on the contrary, thouſands and ten thouſands, who deteſt the project as much as they did the late ſtamp act, and look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on an American epiſcopate to be a more tremendous evil, and more certainly calculated to deprive us of our liberty, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to the worſt and moſt infamous kind of b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="283" facs="unknown:011212_0146_0F862E50776DE160"/>this ſpiritual tyranny and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>avery, by all lawful ways and means in their power.—What can we think of the clergy, veſtries and governors, who repreſented it to be the inclinations of the people in thoſe regions, that ſuch officers ſhould be ſent hither? What is there that ſuch men will ſtick at, who dare thus in the face of the Sun, contradict the plaineſt facts, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form our gracious Sovereign, that we deſire a Biſhop, when there is ſcarce any thing we more deteſt and abhor?</p>
               <p>I am greatly miſtaken if Dr. Chandler be not guilty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing this miſrepreſentation of the colonies, as falſe and diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous at it is. He had repreſented in the former part of his appeal, the great importance and neceſſity of ſending Biſhops to the colonies, in ſuch a rue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ul and pathetic manner, that he ſeems to have been afraid, the warmth of his imagination had tranſported him too far, that he had overacted his part, and that his repreſentations might afford grounds for ſundry objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the character of his ſuperiors, for not ſending Biſhops long ago, ſince the call for them was ſo extremely urgent, and indeed if but one half of what he ſays upon the great excellency, neceſſity, importance and uſefulneſs of an American epiſcopate to the colonies, the church, the Negroes and Indians, were true, it would reflect ſignal reproach on the Engliſh Biſhops at home, for being ſo remiſs and negligent in endeavouring to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us this moſt momentous bleſſing: As this might therefore give them great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>brage, our appellant, after having conjured up a real ghoſt, while he was purſuing his ideal bleſſing a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, found it neceſſary to try to lay him again. Among other things, which he ſays in anſwer to this ſhrewd objection, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that, <q>the colonies were generally ſettled by private ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers; and ſome of them by thoſe who had an averſion to epiſcopal government. The propriety of not ſending a Biſhop to colonies of the la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>er ſort, will be diſputed by none." P. 47.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This paſſage would ſeem at firſt view, a generous conceſſion, and a full acknowledgment that there would be no propriety in ſending a Biſhop to the colonies, northeaſt of Maryland, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it will be difficult to prove with ſatisfactory evidence, that the firſt ſettlers of theſe colonies had not in general an averſion to epiſcopal government; ſo many of them having been har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed and perſecuted in a moſt cruel and barbarous manner, by theſe eccleſiaſtical tyrants, who were a diſgrace to the reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the greateſt plagues to the church and nation. And it will be difficult to prove, that this averſion is eradicated, ſince a vaſt majority of the preſent inhabitants, the poſterity of thoſe perſecuted refugees are filled with abhorrence of all ſuch Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:011212_0147_0F862E5236B756E8"/>upon the review of the many oppreſſions and barbarities which their forefathers for a long courſe of years ſuffered from their mercileſs hands. In this view the paſſage quoted from the Doctor, would breathe a very noble and Chriſtian ſpirit: For in this caſe agreeable to the ſociety's inference from the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of our being inclined to have a Biſhop, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hat this was the voice of God, it may with equal propriety and ſtrength of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be inferred that the general and great averſion to Biſhops in the colonies, is the voice of God, that none ſhould be ſent here. Why is not their ſtrong averſion to American prelates, as divine an argument againſt them, as their inclination for them would be, eſpecially ſince the averſion is real and general, and their inclination, bating only the convention and a few zealots, falſe and imaginary.</p>
               <p>But this cannot poſſibly be the Doctor's meaning, in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage under conſideration, becauſe ſuch a declaration would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the whole of his appeal, and the ſeven famous petitions; ſince the appeal and the petitions, make application for Biſhops for theſe very colonies, that have the greateſt averſion to prelacy. We muſt then ſearch for another meaning to this paſſage, and tho' it is one of thoſe paſſages in which the author found it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, not to ſpeak out fully, but to leave eliptical, rather im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied than expreſſed, for very obvious reaſons, to mince and ſmooth it over with much artifice; yet it is not very difficult to ſupply the elipſis, and diſcover the true ſenſe by comparing <q>it with ſome other paſſages, viz. "That tho' theſe colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were ſettled by thoſe, who had an averſion to epiſcopal government, and there would have been no propriety in ſending Biſhops to them while this remained; yet this being now chiefly removed, the preſent inhabitants in general, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conformed to the church of England, there is now not only the greateſt propriety, but even a neceſſity that they ſhould be immediately ſent to theſe colonies to confirm this wonderful converſion to epiſcopacy.</q>
               </p>
               <p>That this is the true and only conſiſtent ſenſe of the paſſage under conſideration, I think may be demonſtrably proved, from the following paſſage. "Whatever notions the Diſſenters in this country may have formerly entertained, concerning the church; yet of late years, they have have greatly come off from their prejudices."—In the former part of this century, the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of American clergy and profeſſors of the church.—was ſmall and inconſiderable in compariſon with the amount of their preſent number.—And even then, he tells us with ſeeming approbation, the clergy veſtries, and governors of provinces,
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:011212_0147_0F862E5236B756E8"/>ſigned petitions or addreſſes, ſetting forth, that it was the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the people in the colonies to have an American Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, which they looked upon to be the voice of God approving the ſcheme. Now when he had thus told us from the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the clergy, the veſtries and the governors of provinces, that the inclinations of the people in the American regions, were to have Biſhops among them, fifty years ago; and that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of the church of England, were ſmall and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then in compariſon with the amount of their preſent num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, what can any ſtranger to America conclude, but that they are all in general conformed to the church?—Accordingly he has repreſented in his appeal, that the profeſſors of the church of England in America, are about a million who complain for want of biſhops. <q>Will not, ſays he, then the complaints of near a million of Britiſh ſubjects, who are ſuffering under the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

But who that has any tolerable acquaintance with America, and the numbers of the various denominations, does not know this calculation of the Doctor, to be a moſt gla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It is aſtoniſhing that he ſhould have no greater regard for his public reputation, than to ſtuff his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal with ſuch ſtriking falſehoods, entrenched as he may flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter himſelf to be, within the authority of the clergy, veſtries and governors of provinces. For how many ſuch authorities will be ſufficient to convert a notorious falſehood, into an important and ſerious truth? To have requeſted a Biſhop at all, ſince he is likely to prove ſo injurious to the civil and religious liberties of the colonies, would have been highly unreaſonable, but to report that we are deſirous of ſuch an opp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IF I juſtly remember, both you and your Antagoniſt, the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Whig, in ſome of your preliminary Numbers, promiſed to relieve your Readers, when tired of the <q>Dry Cruſt of Controverſy,</q> by now and then throwing into your Papers ſomething ſprightly and entertaining. This Engagement, I confeſs, has been pretty well comply'd with on your own Part: But the Whig ſeems utterly to have forgotten his Promiſe; unleſs he goes upon the old Maxim, <q>That he who acts by another, acts by himſelf.</q> On the Strength of This, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he may fondly hope to juſtify his Procedure; as it is more than probable that Sir Iſaac Foot, writes his Kick by Whiggiſh Direction,—moſt palpably under Whiggiſh Influence.</p>
               <p>However, as the Knight ſeems to have ſunk into total Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect, (if peradventure any Regard was ever paid to his Babble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Buffoonery,) I think it incumbent on his Maſter, who I will preſume is ſomewhat more attended to, at length to give us ſome Specimens of that Wit and Humour, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, it has been ſaid, gained him ſome ſmall Reputation: Tho' from what I have ſeen, heard, and underſtood, at leaſt Five Eights of it were given him by the good Nature of the Public; ſeveral ſpirited Performances in the ludicrous Style, having been fathered on Him, tho' they were in Reality the Offspring of ſome other Parent; which it ſeems, the Gentleman's ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Modeſty would not ſuffer him to diſavow. But, be that as it may, I ſhould be glad that either He, or ſome of his Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates, (for I cannot but ſuppoſe that he has ſome ſuperior to Sir Iſaac,—I cannot but ſuppoſe (a Suppoſition, Mr. Tickle, which he has not made in your Favour) that ſome Men of Gen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>s may be ſound among the Variety of Writers that are engaged in his Paper) I ſay, I ſhould be glad that ſome of the Conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy would give us a few Strokes of that Humour (ſtill avoiding all perſonal Reflections) with which, "I am told," he has long
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:011212_0149_0F862E53A66E6100"/>ago, and openly threatened to be <q>avenged of his Adverſaries. Laugh and be Fat,</q> is an old Preſcription: I hope he will try <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ts Efficacy, both for his own Sake, and for the Sake of many others, as well his Writers as Readers, who, I will be bold to ſay, are every Way poor enough, except in Head and in Spirit.</p>
               <p>I know you have declared, that you look upon Sir Iſaac as below your Notice, or even your contempt; and I do aſſure you, that unleſs I was convinced in my own Mind that you really thought him ſo, I never ſhould have diſhonoured myſelf and my Profeſſion, by writing to you upon the Occaſion. But meeting accidentally with a Complaint of his, in one of his lateſt Numbers, <q>That the People either did not read, or elſe that they did not underſtand him,</q> or Words to that Effect, I ſnatched up my Pen, and wrote the following Ode, as I ſtood by the Side of my Counting Deſk, as faſt, aye, as faſt, Mr. Tickle, as moſt Folks can read it—And now as it came from my Pen ſo glibly, and as it is the firſt of my Exhibitions in the poetical Way, if you can prevail upon yourſelf to think it no Breach of your Engagement to the Public, to inſert it in your Whip (I mean, if you can forgive this Notice being taken of the illuſtrious Commoner) I ſhould eſteem it a particular Favour. I cannot ſay that the Verſification is in all Places very harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but I hope that both yourſelf, and the Public, will forgive or get over any little Hobble, of which Inexperience muſt be thought the Occaſion.</p>

               <p>AMONGST all the various devices that have from time to time been formed by thoſe who aſpire to lord it over God's heritage, there probably never was a more pernicious ſcheme concerted for the deſtruction of our religious liberties, than that of eſtabliſhing an epiſcopate in the American plantations. It muſt therefore be matter of rejoicing to every ſerious mind, that the advocates for this ruinous project, appear daily more and more cre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t-fallen and dejected; while its oppoſers increaſe in number, and are manifeſtly victorious in argument.—Nay, ſo far ſuperior to the little juncto, that are engaged in forging chains for a free and loyal people, that I doubt not, but mad wit' deſpair, and raving with diſappointment, having already long ſince abandoned all pretence to reaſon and argument, they will within the ſpace of two months, contract their forces to a competent number for forming a circle round a fire ſide, and vent their <hi>ultima ratio Jacobitorum,</hi> as they uſually do, that is, in curſing the Whigs, and drinking to the reſtoration of a Tory adminiſtration. But however promiſing, the proſpect of their ſpeedy and total defeat; I think we ſhould not rely on an arm of fleſh. If not ſo much as a ſparrow falls to the ground, without the will of our Heavenly father, how much more ought we to eye the diſpenſations of providence, in a matter ſo mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentous to our moſt ineſtimable privileges. I would therefore draw my encouragement of ſucceſs, from a devout conſideration of the reaſons we have for ſuppoſing that the great diſpoſer of events is on our ſide. And if he be for us, who ſhall be againſt us?</p>
               <p>It has juſtly been obſerved by divines, that what we generally call ſecond cauſes, are not cauſes in ſtrict propriety of ſpeech; and what we call the laws of nature, are only certain rules and methods, by which the great ruler of the world generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:011212_0152_0F862EFEA109AC10"/>in thoſe of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ons, which fall under our cognizance: Nay, that the right notion of the divine omnipreſence will greatly aſſiſt us, in forming a juſt apprehenſion of the nature of that providence, which reſpects not only the great events, but the minuteſt circumſtances of every the ſmalleſt action and event in the world: Even that providence, by which "the very hairs of our heads are all numbered." That though the providence of God preſides over, and governs all things, it has a peculiar influence upon all the great events that happen to men, and eſpecially in reſpect of ſuch, wherein the fate of a whole people is involved. And that theſe are effected by the Deity's inclining the hearts of men, in a way conſiſtent with rational agents, to accompliſh the purpoſes of his will, and by controuling the deſigns, or infatuating the counſels of thoſe who act againſt his divine predeſtinations. Thus we frequently find, that he terrifies bad men, with ſtrange amazements, to diſcover their own conſpiracies, and to fall into the ſnares which they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly laid for others.—Agreeable to this, the ſacred oracles inform us, that <q>he fruſtrate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>h the tokens of liars, and makes diviners mad; turneth wiſe men backward, and maketh their knowledge fooliſh.</q> I remember an excellent remark of the pious Mr. Matthew Henry, in his comment on the conduct of Rehoboam, who like the Biſhop of Landaff, had been adviſing with a parcel of hot-headed ſtriplings. <q>God, ſays he, often fulfills the counſels of his own wiſdom, by infatuating men, and giving them up to the counſels of their own folly. No more needs be done to ruin men, and to leave them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their own pride and paſſion.</q> Let us examine the mad conduct of our diviners, and trace their conſpiracy by this rule, and we ſhall find great reaſon to thank God for the comfortable hopes, that he is by a ſtrange concurrence of exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cauſes, about making their knowledge fooliſh. The world had hitherto been impoſed upon by the ſpecious pretences of a certain ſociety, who had ſecretly been preparing the way for an epiſcopate in America, by introducing miſſionaries into this country, to pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>elyte the different denominations of Chriſtians to epiſcopacy. This being done under colour of converting the Pagans to Chriſtianity, was ſo far from giving umbrage at home, that thouſands of Diſſenters, yearly contributed to the apparent, without ſo much as conjecturing about the true and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent deſign. And this ſcheme, tho' ſuſpected by ſome among us, yet being only ſuſpected, might have been proſecuted for years to come, without affording any ſatisfactory evidence in reality. Such being the caſe, who could have imagined, that a man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in this very plot, and who muſt certainly have known that
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:011212_0152_0F862EFEA109AC10"/>its ſucceſs depended on its being kept a ſecret, till another cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury had matured it for execution, ſhould, in the moſt public manner, divulge it thro' the nation; than which nothing in the world could more contribute to mar and ruin it.</p>
               <p>But being ſmitten with the ſplendor of an American Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric, which notwithſtanding the incredible fuſtian about a primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Biſhop, is intended to outſhine the inconſiderable lack-caſh ſee of Landaff, his Lordſhip under the moſt aſtoniſhing infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion declares, <q>This point obtained [the miſſion of Biſhops to the Colonies] the American church will ſoon go out of its infant ſtate, be able to ſtand upon its own legs, and without foreign help, ſupport and ſpread itſelf." "Then the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this ſociety will have been brought to the happy iſſue intended.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is the finger of God, leſs diſcernable in his Lordſhip's (who is by many ſuppoſed to be the prelate they had fixt their eye upon, or rather raiſed their eyes unto) diſcovering ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme virulence againſt the non-epiſcopalians in this country, as muſt neceſſarily rouſe them to a greater oppoſition than perhaps they would otherwiſe have given.</p>
               <p>I proceed now to ſhew the reaſons we have to conclude, that the providence of God is about confounding the meaſures of theſe men by the ſtriking inſtances of infatuation in the conduct of Dr. Chandler, all tending to defeat the very project he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to promote.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. He appears ſenſible, that whatever were his private ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents about the religious denominations, not of his own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion; it was but common prudence, not to affront them in an affair in which he ſeems deſirous, if not of their aſſiſtance, at leaſt of them neutrality. Actuated by this principle, he has in ſome parts o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> his pamphlet treated them with ſuch marks of reſpect, as nothing but the moſt abſolute neceſſity could have extorted from a perſon of his bigotted turn. And yet in other parts, he appears ſo unaccountably infatuated, as to repreſent them, tho' <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> could ſerve no imaginable purpoſe, and is flatly contrary to truth, as <q>ſounding the trumpet of ſedition, and being diſaffected to the civil eſtabliſhment.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2d. Tho' he confeſſes it altogether unneceſſaay to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to inſiſt on the divine right of epiſcopacy; yet hath he openly avowed ſuch an attachment to the Jure Divino of dioceſan Biſhops, as (ſuppoſing his illogical ſyllogiſms to be concluſive) to unchurch, and conſequently to affront the whole body of Chriſtians in America, except thoſe of his own commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and his good friends in Canada.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. He declares, that he only deſires a harmleſs primitive
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:011212_0153_0F862EFF645FE3C0"/>Biſhop; and on gaining credit to this declaration, the ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful proſecution of his ſcheme principally depends, and yet he has rendered it totally impoſſible to gain any man's belief, by giving more than bare intimations, that as ſoon as his party have ſufficient power and influence, they will procure legiſlative acts, to aggrandize the American hierarchy, and exalt this pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Biſhop into as great a Lord ſpiritual, as ever wielded the epiſcopal ſtaff in England; and now pretends to be affronted for being diſbelieved, this ſelf-contradiction notwithſtanding</p>
               <p n="4">4th. Confounded by the ſame infatuation, he publiſhed an advertiſement in which he ſpeaks with the higheſt contempt of Whig principles, tho' a perſon of half his abilities muſt have known, that nothing could be more fatal to the ſucceſs of his ſcheme, than the diſcovery of a Tory biaſs, in the reign of a Prince whoſe royal progenitor was advanced to the throne on Whig principles, immediately after a ſcheme had been concerted in the reign of the Doctor's beloved Queen Anne, the great pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troneſs of an American epiſcopate, for introducing the Pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, "For America ſays he, has Whigs." Who that was not under a providential infatuation in order to be finally diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, would have ventured to riſk the ſucceſs of his cauſe, on ſo ill-timed, as well as wretched a witticiſm, when he knows, that bating ſome of his own party, and the papiſts in Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, he might ſearch the continent with a lanthorn for a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent character, as Diogenes did Athens for a man, and be baulked in his ſearch.</p>
               <p>I am farther induced to conclude, that God is determined to bring their counſels to nought, and to make the devices of theſe people of none effect, on conſidering ſome remarkable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential occurrences in the conduct of the convention, as that their malevolent calumnies on as obedient and loyal a people, as any Prince upon earth could ever boaſt, ſhould, notwithſtanding their ſtudied ſecrecy, be ſo ſoon divulged. <q>So that tho' they ſhot in ſecret and encouraged themſelves in an evil matter, and communed of laying ſnares privily, ſaying who ſhall ſee them, a bird of the air carried the voice, and that which hath wings diſcovered the matter.</q> That they ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a perſon to conciliate the good graces of the non epiſcopa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, who, from his narrow principles, they muſt have known, could not poſſibly write with temper on the ſubject of epiſcopacy. Nor while contemplating this his grand idol, refrain from uſing thoſe whom he moſt nonſenſically calls Diſſenters, with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and inſult,—That they ſhould notwithſtanding his invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of all objectors to propoſe their objections, no ſooner find an opponent, than determine to treat him with the moſt unpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallelled
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:011212_0153_0F862EFF645FE3C0"/>ſcurrility; and in order weekly to abuſe him, retain in their ſervice, a brace of reverend blunderbuſſes, who in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Milton, are lower than the loweſt; and by that means exhibit the cleareſt demonſtration of that very ſpirit, which, tho' at preſent, harmleſs and deſpicable for want of power, the continent ſo greatly and ſo juſtly apprehends, when armed with the temporal powers of a Biſhop, which will enable them to carry it into the moſt dreadful and unrelenting execution.— And finally, that of all the members of the convention (among whom there muſt doubtleſs be ſome men of ability and temper) they ſhould depute ſuch a genius as Mr. I-gl-fs, to preface and correct their laborious defence of a defamatory ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; and after having decluded a poor credulous creature by their moſt malevolent miſrepreſentations, render him ſtill more ridiculous, by the ſlander and falſhoods, interſperſed through their vindication.</p>
               <p>From theſe obſervations on the conduct of providence, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this intereſting affair, I think we may conclude that it does not ſeem at preſent agreeable to the divine will, to give ſucceſs to the meaſure; and that notwithſtanding the great demerit of our ſins, we ſhall not be chaſtiſed for them, with the particular puniſhment meditated by the convention; but that he who hath from time to time delivered us from the mercileſs deſigns of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious and unreaſonable men, and ſtill brings to light the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den things of darkneſs, and hath preſerved to us our religion and liberty, in deſpite of all the malicious and reſtleſs attempts of our adverſaries, will alſo in his infinite mercy, reſcue us from that tremendous deſtruction which was ready to devour us.</p>

               <p>A Propos! Sq. <hi>T.</hi> (No. XXVI) talks of ſome who by "multiplying words" endeavour to prove that <hi>black</hi> is <hi>white.</hi> Among this kind of gentry he himſelf makes a diſtinguiſh'd figure; he writes as tho' he had the ſame venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the <hi>appeal,</hi> as for the BIBLE; and right or wrong, wou'd fain perſuade us, that the whole is conſiſtent and rational.
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:011212_0154_0F862F015C1E1308"/>He may be, for aught I know, as much a voluntier in this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as the <hi>Whig</hi> in a better; but, tho' he may not be <hi>paid</hi> for <hi>conceiving.</hi> I'm not clear that he does not <hi>pay largely</hi> for the <hi>delivery</hi> of his MICE. NIGRICOLA, 'tis true, propoſed a <hi>negro</hi> epiſcopate; but I can't find that the <hi>Whig</hi> (as Sq. <hi>T.</hi> pretends) has ſaid a ſyllable about the matter: however, if <hi>negroes</hi> could be proved <hi>white men,</hi> the character of the appeal, as to <hi>ſincerity,</hi> wou'd not ſuffer in the leaſt by the argument.</p>
               <p>I wonder not that the <hi>Whig</hi> has (nor ſhould I have wonder'd if the grave Dr. CHAUNCEY had) ridicul'd Dr. <hi>C's</hi> queer long-winded argument, which begins with <hi>Britiſh conqueſts,</hi> and ends (who wou'd have thought it?) with an <hi>American epiſcopate;</hi> for, in ſpite of all the tinkling of Sq. <hi>T's</hi> hammer, a number of the links in this long chain are evidently too defective to ſupport the huge weight of a Biſhop.—For, that what is called the <hi>national,</hi> is "the pureſt and beſt" <hi>religion,</hi>—that the opinion of the <hi>civil</hi> magiſtrate concerning <hi>religious</hi> matters, which either are diſputable or affect the rights of conſcience, ought to be conſidered as the <hi>national opinion,</hi> and that <hi>epiſcopacy</hi> (or if you pleaſe, <hi>epiſcopal Chriſtianity</hi>) is the "MOST <hi>ſuitable</hi> monument of religious gratitude," are propoſitions very far from being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable. The firſt, (which Dr. <hi>C.</hi> himſelf has half given up) has often been confuted! the 2d. reſts on an abſurdity, viz. that religious ſentiments are capable of delegation: and the 3d. regards the <hi>outſide,</hi> as what principally recommends a ſacrifice to Heaven.</p>
               <p>Sq. <hi>T.</hi> may ſhuffle as much as he pleaſes, but 'tis evident, that by the phraſe <hi>national religion,</hi> Dr. <hi>C.</hi> and he mean, not <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> but merely that "mode, form or ſpecies of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion' call'd <hi>epiſcopacy.</hi> And indeed, in ſpite of his tergiverſation, Sq. <hi>T.</hi> implicitly owns as much in ſome places, where he ſpeaks of thoſe who were <hi>Chriſtians</hi> before, as "receiving"—"adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing"—"preferring"—"eſtabliſhing" &amp;c. what he calls NATI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONAL RELIGION. By this diſtinguiſhing term cannot be meant the <hi>Chriſtian religion,</hi> in which almoſt all denominations agree, but that in which <hi>epiſcopalians</hi> differ from others; for this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, Sq. <hi>T.</hi> ſays, is the "only reaſon" that "it has been made the <hi>national religion.</hi>" (Quere, <hi>was</hi> pure Chriſtianity <hi>without regard to "mode, form or ſpecies" ever</hi> eſtabliſhed by law?)—As Sq. <hi>T.</hi> ſeems fond of the terms "mode, form, and ſpecies" of religion, he muſt give me leave to aſk him a queſtion. —The eſſential materials of dreſs being the ſame in different nations, if I <hi>adopt</hi> or <hi>prefer</hi> the <hi>Engliſh dreſs,</hi> is it not the "<hi>mode, form</hi> or faſhion of the Engliſh dreſs which I <hi>adopt</hi> or <hi>prefer?</hi>—Certainly;—and therefore by Dr. <hi>C's</hi> NATIONAL
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:011212_0154_0F862F015C1E1308"/>RELIGION, we muſt neceſſarily underſtand <hi>epiſcopacy</hi> and its appendages.</p>
               <p>Sq. <hi>T.</hi> ſeems to think the eſtabliſhment of <hi>American prelacy</hi> a "monument of gratitude equally proper" with an <hi>anniverſary thankſgiving.</hi> I conſider it as a <hi>monument</hi> not only leſs proper, but entirely <hi>improper;</hi> becauſe 1. endangering the civil and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious liberties of a people, is evidently no proper method of thanking heaven for their deliverance from arbitrary power and ſavage violence. And 2. If the members of the civil legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture have a right (which I think they have not) to determine for their <hi>conſtituents</hi> in diſputable matters of religion, which may therefore affect the rights of conſcience, the legiſlature of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> certainly has not a right ſo far as to meddle with the internal policy of the <hi>colonies,</hi> as to impoſe a Biſhop any more than to TAX them: and therefore Sq. <hi>T.</hi> need not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs himſelf, for fear the nation will not maintain its "religious character," for want of taking unconſtitutional ſteps. But a national <hi>anniverſary thankſgiving,</hi> being what no man living, not even an <hi>heathen,</hi> can doubt the propriety of, might be "erected as a monument" by the King's prerogative alone. However after all, I can't but think what Dr. <hi>C.</hi> laſt mention'd and is moſt cool about (which however can't be "erected" with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Biſhop) of all, the moſt <hi>proper</hi> "monument of gratitude," <hi>viz.</hi> THE CONVERSION OF AMERICAN HEATHEN. This would be a "monument erected" moſt remarkably on "the very ground" itſelf; and this is what the "Worthy" Dr. Wheelock and others have been ſince the war indefatigably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring: I wiſh I could ſay they had not met with powerful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.</p>
               <p>I can't ſuppoſe even Sq. <hi>T.</hi> would be ſo ſilly as to refuſe a "poor man a ſhilling," merely for fear he would riſe to a "level with himſelf;" but I am ſure he wou'd be loath to give him a <hi>Whip,</hi> if he expected to feel the ſmart of it himſelf.</p>
               <p>The moderation of "our GEORGES and the immortal WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAM" (Whig Princes!) and the arbitrary rule of OLIVER (as well as CHARLES I, ſtimulated by LAUD) we are ready to acknowledge; but certain it is, notwithſtanding, that civil and eccleſiaſtical deſpotiſm, in ſuch a ſtate as ours, naturally tend to introduce each other; and, if they do not hereafter do ſo, we ſhall, I believe, have as much reaſon to thank the <hi>monarch</hi> as the <hi>metropolitan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the <hi>Whig</hi> loſes credit ſo faſt as Sq. <hi>T.</hi> pretends, 'tis a pity <hi>he</hi> labours ſo hard in <hi>Whipping</hi> him.—But alas!

               <p>WHEN we ſee Men, in any public Debate, carefully avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enter into the Merits of the Cauſe, but loud, vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and tedious in dwelling upon Circumſtances; we naturally infer that they are conſcious, either of their own perſonal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency, or of the Badneſs of their Cauſe. This Reflection has been already ſuggeſted, not leſs than 500 Times, by the American Whig and his "Underling" Scribblers.</p>
               <p>I propoſe at this Time to conſider the two Papers in the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Whig, (Numb. XVIII, XIX) upon the general Subject of Epiſcopacy, ſign'd Dordracenſis. Who Dordracenſis is, I know very well. <hi>Faenum habet in Cornu.</hi> But why he ſigns himſelf thus, I know not. If he means thereby to intimate his Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the Proceedings of the Synod of Dort, it is not much to his Credit. For, as a very maſterly and candid Writer ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, <q>the Synod of Dort was convened in Malice, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected in Policy, and came not to examine the Truth, but to puniſh the Remonſtrants; themſelves acknowledging that they came not to diſpute, but condemn.</q> 
                  <hi>Ad judicandum quippe, non ad diſputandum, Se conveniſſe aiebat Synodus.</hi> Acta. &amp;c. Pref. P. 5. I doubt not but many who ſubſcribe to, and approve of the Doctrines then and there eſtabliſhed, hold in Abhorrence the Conduct of that Synod.</p>
               <p>But as I was going to ſay: I know Dordracenſis, what he
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:011212_0155_0F862F0228D896B8"/>is—what he has been—and what he lately would have been, if he could. You may ſay, What is all this, to the Purpoſe of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering his Papers on the Subject of Epiſcopacy? I reply, that it is, and I will maintain it to be, as much to the Purpoſe, as his Papers on Epiſcopacy are to the Purpoſe of the grand Point in Debate.</p>
               <p>Dr. Chandler thought proper to introduce the Subject of American Biſhops with a brief Sketch of the Arguments in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Epiſcopacy, and an Explanation of the Epiſcopal Office, according to the Doctrine and Belief of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; in Order to ſhew, that, upon the Principles of the Church, Ordination, Confirmation, and a regular Government of the Clergy cannot be exerciſed in America, for Want of Biſhops. It was thought that a brief Explanation of theſe Points was not improper, to enable thoſe, who are Strangers to our Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to judge of the great Diſadvantages and Hardſhips the American Church of England is under, while without an Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copate. For the only fair Way for Men to judge of this Caſe is, to conſider it upon the Principles of the Church, and not of thoſe who differ from it. Accordingly the Author of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal very juſtly obſerves, that whether we are right or wrong in our Principles of Eccleſiaſtical Polity, our Plea for American Biſhops is equally valid; for no Plea of this Kind can be founded on the abſolute Truth of Principles, but on the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Truth of them. It is evident therefore, that an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to overthrow the Doctrine of Epiſcopacy as maintained in the Church of England, can make no Part of a regular Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Propoſal of American Biſhops; and that it is as foreign from the proper Point in Debate, as a tedious Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the Colour of a Cow, or the Length of Her Horns, in a Diſpute concerning her legal Proprietor.</p>
               <p>However I propoſe briefly to conſider what Maſter Dordra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſis has offered on the Subject, and to truſs up his two Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers together, like a Brace of "Snipes;" for verily, gentle Reader, like Snipes they are, being, altho' long-leged, yet ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied. His firſt Paper conſiſts altogether of Preſumptions, alias preſumptive Arguments againſt Epiſcopacy.</p>
               <p n="1">1. His firſt preſumptive Argument is, "that the Reformers, when they rejected the Errors of Popery, rejected with it Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy." I am ſorry, if this Writer believes his own Aſſertion, that he has been ſo groſsly miſinformed. None of the Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ever rejected Epiſcopacy on the Footing of its being an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation in the Church; but ſome of them were obliged to depart from it, as they have often lamented, on Account of the Reſtraints of the civil Power. As to Preſbyterianiſm, Bp. Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net,
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:011212_0156_0F862F0379372BC8"/>never blindly prejudiced againſt its Diſciples, has ſhewn it to have been originally a political Engine of popiſh Invention.</p>
               <p n="2">2. "All the preſent Churches, except that of England, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim Epiſcopacy." This is ſo far from being true, that moſt of them enjoy it; and the reſt of them wiſh for it, if there is any Truth and Sincerity in their Declarations. I could produce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Documents in Proof of this; but I will content my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a ſingle one, which is recommended to the peculiar Attention of Dordracenſis. It is taken from the Church of Holland in the Synod of Dort. Bp. Carleton, a Member of the Synod, informs us, that having made a public Proteſtation againſt Preſbyterianiſm and in Favour of Epiſcopacy, be told the Divines of that Synod in a Conferrence, that the Cauſe of all their Troubles was becauſe they had no Biſhops, &amp;c. To this they anſwered, <q>That they had a great Honour for the good Order and Diſcipline in the Church of England, and heartily wiſhed they could eſtabliſh themſelves upon this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del; but they had no Proſpect of ſuch a Happineſs; and ſince the civil Government had made their Deſires impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they hoped God would be merciful to them.</q> As to the ancient Waldenſes and Albigenſes, here claſſed under the Head of preſent Churches, I affirm, upon the moſt valid and unexceptionable Authority, againſt this Writer, and thoſe who have deceived him, that they were ſtrictly and properly epiſcopal.</p>
               <p n="3">3. His next preſumptive Argument againſt Dioceſan Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy is, "that many of the brighteſt Lights in the Nation (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by this Metaphor, the Diſſenters) cannot in Conſcience con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to it." But a better preſumptive Argument for it is, that a far greater Number of as bright Lights in the Nation, cannot in Conſcience reject it. If indeed there are many poor Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Miniſters, who would find their Advantage in conforming to the Church, but chooſe rather to forego it, tho' I queſtion whether there be many ſuch; this may be allowed to be a Proof of their Sincerity, but cannot be admitted as an Evidence of the Truth of their Notions. The Engliſh Papiſts make a much greater Sacrifice of wordly Advantages than they; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, upon the Plan of this preſumptive Argument, offer a much ſtronger Proof in Favour of Popery.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <q>Epiſcopacy ſeems not ſo conſiſtent with the Genius of the Goſpel, and the Humility it ſo ſtrictly inculcates, as the Scheme of an Equality amongſt Miniſters.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. "It is more apt to ſwell proud Ambition," i.e. not humble Ambition. I put theſe two preſumptive Arguments together, becauſe in Reality they are no more, and ought not to count more than One. And if it proves any Thing, it proves too
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:011212_0156_0F862F0379372BC8"/>much; namely, that the Superiority of the Twelve over the Seventy—of the Apoſtles over the Elders,—and perhaps of Chriſt himſelf over his Apoſtles, was inconſiſtent with the Genius of the Goſpel. The ſame Kind of Argument in the Mouth of a Republican (I hope Dordracenſis is not one) would as concluſively prove, that there ought to be no Superiority of Office in the State, nor in our Fleets and Armies. Dordracenſis here tells us, as we have been told a thouſand Times by others, with equal Pertinence, of Diotrephes who loved the Prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. Now what a ſad Fellow was this ſame Diotrephes? I believe him to have been a moſt ambitious, irregular Man; and the learned Dr. Hammond has unanſwerably proved him to have been a Preſbyterian. <q>Diotrephes, ſays he, was not ordained to any Office of Power, in the Aſian Church,—but of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, without any Miſſion, nay expreſsly againſt the Apoſtles' Conſent, was willing to aſſume and exerciſe this Power; and is but an Example of Korah's Sedition and preſumptuous Humour; and that is inevitably the Caſe of the Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian,</q> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="6 7">6, and 7. Theſe two Arguments again can count but One; and they tend to prove (ſo far as Arguments upon the Weather-Cock Eſtabliſhment, turning round and round, can have any particular Tendency) that no Man, either in Church or State, ought to be entruſted with, or to undertake, the Government of others.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The laſt preſumptive Argument here againſt Dioceſan Epiſcopacy is, that <q>ſeveral Biſhops, &amp;c. of the Church of England, have themſelves diſavowed the divine Inſtitution of it.</q> And here we are told of Cranmer, and others, and are referred to Stillingfleet's Irenicum, in Support of a long String of Miſrepreſentations. But does not Dordracenſis know, if not I now tell him, that the Irenicum is no Authority, and is looked upon by the Advocates for Epiſcopacy as no Evidence, in the Caſe before us. None can have a greater Veneration for the Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Bp. Stillingfleet than I have. I believe him to have been one of the greateſt Scholars and beſt Men of his Age; and I never wiſh to ſee any Men higher in their Principles, than that mild and excellent Prelate. At the ſame Time I do not ſcruple to declare, that I look upon his Irenicum to have been a haſty, indigeſted and partial Account of Principles and Facts. And in this the good Biſhop would not have blamed me; for when he had examined Matters more thoroughly, he looked upon it in the ſame Light himſelf. His Deſign in writing, appears to have been a good one; which was, in general, to aſſiſt in compoſing the religious Differences that then tore the Nation in Pieces,
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:011212_0157_0F862F03E21C2998"/>and particularly, in Order thereto, to demoliſh the <hi>Jus Divinu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                  </hi> of Preſbytery. But his Zeal carried him, as it often carried others, into an Extreme. It repreſented Things to him thro' the Medium of Prejudice; but it was not long before he was able to correct his Miſtakes, and to form a very different Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, both of Principles and Perſons. He wrote his Irenicum at the Age of 24, and did not ſcruple to condemn it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf afterwards, declaring, <q>That there are many Things in it, which if he were to write again, he would not ſay; ſome which ſhew his Youth, and want of due Conſideration; others, which he yielded too far, in Hopes of gaining the Diſſenting Parties to the Church of England.</q> As to Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, he was once a Papiſt; afterwards a Proteſtant; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died, as good a Churchman as almoſt any of his Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid more than enough, in anſwer to the preſumptive Arguments in the Papers before me, and their Invalidity is no bad preſumptive Argument of the Invalidity of the Cauſe they are made uſe of to ſupport. I ſhall now proceed to the ſecond Paper, wherein Dordracenſis undertakes to <q>produce poſitive Proofs from the New-Teſtament, againſt Dioceſan Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy.</q> But his poſitive Proofs amount in Number to no more than a ſingle one, at which he labours through the bigger Part of his Paper; and what he produces farther than this, cannot, by the greateſt Stretch of Courteſy, be allowed a higher Title than that of preſumptive Arguments.</p>
               <p>The poſitive Proof is taken from the Ordination of Timothy; on which one Inſtance, aided by poſitive Aſſertions, Dordracen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis is obliged to reſt the whole Weight of his Cauſe. And what Proof it is will be ſeen preſently. <q>If there had been, ſays he, one Inſtance in the ſacred Scripture, of a Miniſter of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, ordained to his Office, by the Impoſition of a Biſhop; how greatly would the Epiſcopalians have triumphed in ſuch a Caſe? I think therefore, as there is an Inſtance of a proper Ordination to the miniſterial Office, recorded in the New-Teſtament, which is ſaid to have been done by the laying on of the Hands of the Preſbytery, the Point ought to be given up.</q> His Inſtance of Preſbyterian Ordination, as I have obſerved, is that of Timothy, to whom St. Paul ſays in his firſt Epiſtle to him, <q>Neglect not the Gift which is in thee, which was given thee by Prophecy, with the laying on of the Hands of the Preſbytery.</q> I will allow that this Paſſage relates to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Timothy, and that the Hands of the Preſbytery were impoſed in his Ordination. But ſtill, Evidence is wanting to prove that the Word Preſbytery was intended to convey the
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:011212_0157_0F862F03E21C2998"/>Ideas, which are affixed to it by our modern Preſbyterians. It is farther obſervable, that the Office is ſaid to have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, not by, but with the laying on of the Hands of the Preſbytery; which is a feeble Expreſſion, and I believe has never been uſed, in any other Inſtance, to ſignify the actual Conveyance of Authority. Upon an Inſpection therefore of the Paſſage, two Difficulties immediately offer themſelves: One is, to ſettle the Meaning of the Word Preſbytery; the other is, to account for the Expreſſion, "with the laying on of Hands." Now the only proper Way of clearing up theſe Points, is to compare the Caſe with other Inſtances of the like Nature in Scripture, if any are to be found. And upon Inquiry it will appear, that there are various other Inſtances of Ordination recorded in the New-Teſtament, in each of which the Office was performed by thoſe who were ſuperior to Preſbyters. An impartial Inquirer will therefore endeavour to explain the Paſſage in ſuch a Manner, as to render it conſiſtent with the known Practice of the Apoſtles. That there are ſeveral Ways of doing this, Dordracenſis knows; he is pleaſed to call them Evaſions, but giving harſh Names is one of the eaſieſt Ways of getting clear of Difficulties. I do not at preſent contend for any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Interpretation, but approve of any which the Expreſſions will bear, if it can be reconciled with that Syſtem upon which the Apoſtles evidently acted; and I inſiſt upon it, that every Interpretation, which is irreconcileable therewith, is falſe, and ought to be rejected</p>
               <p>I have ſaid no more than what, I imagine, the firſt Inſpection of the Paſſage under Conſideration would naturally ſuggeſt to a Mind diveſted of Prejudices; and this, of itſelf, is ſufficient to guard Men againſt the novel Interpretation of the Preſbyterians. But for our farther Security, it ſo happens, that this very Caſe of Timothy's Ordination is, in another Place, mentioned by the fame Apoſtle, and expreſſed in ſuch a Manner as to afford an obvious Solution of all the Difficulties that attend the Paſſage we have been conſidering. <q>Wherefore I put thee in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,</q> ſays St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his ſecond Epiſtle to him, <q>that thou ſtir up the Gift of God, which is in thee, by the putting on of <hi>my Hands</hi>
                  </q> 2. Tim. i. 6. This Text. with a ſtrong Light of Evidence, burſting through the Cloud of Objections that has been raiſed to darken it, as manifeſtly refers to Timothy's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, as the other Text before-mentioned. Not ſo, ſays Dordracenſis; and he endeavours to aſſign Reaſons. But they are ſo poor, jejune and futile, as not to deſerve Notice. It is really a pitiable Caſe, that our Adverſaries ſhould be reduced to the hard Shift of maintaining, that the latter Text has no Relation to that Fact or Event, to which they contend that the
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:011212_0158_0F862F08712E9380"/>ſame leading Word in the other Text has an excluſive Reference! The whole Force of their Argument is, <hi>Sic nole, ſic jubeo, ſtat pro Ratione</hi> No <hi>luntas.</hi> But others will take the Liberty to conclude, upon a Compariſon of the Two Paſſages—that, in the Ordination of Timothy, the Hands of the Preſbytery, in whatever Senſe the Word is uſed, were not impoſed without thoſe of an Apoſtle,—and, that the Gift therein mentioned, was confered by the Hands of St. Paul, as well as <q>with the laying on of the Hands of the Preſbytery.</q>
               </p>
               <p>What has been ſaid is ſufficient to ſhew, that the Ordination of Timothy was not Preſbyterian, but Epiſcopal; or, if Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dracenſis likes his own Phraſeology better, "by the Impoſition of a Biſhop." I had Thoughts of producing ſeveral other Inſtances from Scripture, of epiſcopal Ordination, which can eaſily be done; but the Limits to which I am confined will not at preſent admit of it.—Dordracenſis ſeems to allow that we may tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, upon producing a ſingle one. One has been fairly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; and, to add to the Honour of the Triumph, it is the very Inſtance on which alone he placed his Dependence.</p>
               <p>Dordracenſis has drawn out a Number of preſumptive Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, for ſuch they are, if they can be called Arguments in any Senſe, to guard the Rear of his Papers; but I am perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Reader will readily excuſe me from concerning myſelf farther with preſumptive Arguments. When Dordracenſis undertakes, according to his Promiſe, to demoliſh Chilling-worth, as I expect to ſee rare Work, I propoſe to do myſelf the Pleaſure of attending him.—I have alſo ſome what to ſay to him, in due Time, on the Subject of an uninterrupted Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</p>

               <head>From Mr. PARKER's GAZETTE, Dec. 5, 1768. The AMERICAN WHIG, No. XXXIX. <hi>INGLISIANA,</hi> PART I.</head>
               <p>MR. William Livingſton having promiſed in the Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prefixed to his Letter to the Biſhop of Landaff, that he would acknowledge himſelf under obligations, ſhould he be miſtaken in any the moſt immaterial circumſtance, to the friendly hand that pointed out his error, provided the perſon diſcovering his miſtake did it with decency and temper, and was not aſhamed to diſcover his own name; might reaſonably have expected, that if any of the miſſionaries thought themſelves
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:011212_0158_0F862F08712E9380"/>obliged to defend a man, whom in all probability themſelves had deluded, they would act upon equal terms; and not meanly ſhelter themſelves within the intrenchments of anonymous ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal. Such a ſtep, tho' the nameleſs author of the Vindication, thinks it "of no conſequence to the public who or what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of perſon he is," was of great importance to the author of the letter; as the contrary conduct has given his antagoniſt an opportunity of uſing ſuch language, as no gentleman could think conſiſtent with the dignity of his character, if he appeared openly. It was moreover extremely mean, as a contrivance to diſable Mr. Livingſton from replying, without breaking his word. Thus his not anſwering was to be conſtrued into a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat; and if he anſwered, they were to triumph in the viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his promiſe: Mean while he was to be beſpattered with their weekly billingſgate; and moſt heroically dared to anſwer, tho' not a ſingle miſſionary choſe to ſubſcribe his name to the challenge. But what muſt the impartial world think of a man who indulges himſelf in ſuch ſcurrilous liberties, becauſe he flatters himſelf that he will not be diſcovered. Who will know it, is the argument that prompts little minds to commit theſe indecencies. Secure from being detected by others, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awed by any ſelf reſpect, they take up their vilifying pens; and thence ariſe thoſe buffooneries which are only fit for the gentry of Wapping. This however, ſneaking as it is, has been the conſtant practice of this ſet of men. Thus they treated Dr. Mayhew, who, tho' he prefix'd his name to his writings, was perpetually attacked by anonimous pamphleteers, till he laid an Archbiſhop upon his back, without knowing his adverſary; and after being long ſince dead, is now re-aſſaulted in the ſame inſidious and ungentleman-like manner. Having therefore by this deſpicable artifice, prevented the letter-writer from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf-juſtice, and the Biſhop of Landaff's ſermon, being evidently calculated to facilitate his Lordſhip's acquiſition of an American Biſhopric, and thus unqueſtionably coincident with my deſign of expoſing the project of any ſuch epiſcopate; I ſhall without farther apology, undertake a reply to the ſo much cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Vindication. But as I am determined never long to loſe ſight of the main object, the Appeal, till every part of it is refu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed; I ſhall not hold myſelf obliged to proſecute the ſubject of the Vindication, in an uninterrupted ſucceſſion. That the reader, may however, be no loſer by the interruption, I ſhall entitle all the papers on this ſubject, <hi>Ingliſiana:</hi> and by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering them in the order they ſucceed each other, he may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways peruſe them in their connection, notwithſtanding the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of any other ſubjects, between their ſeveral numbers. In
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:011212_0159_0F862F09CD8165C0"/>four or five papers I hope completely to refute the Vindication, and to reduce the author (whom this notable performance, has by an incredible miracle exalted at leaſt a cubit above his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) to his priſtine dimenſions.</p>
               <p>Tho' this writer hath thought proper, for reaſons beſt known to himſelf, to conceal his name, it is no ſecret, that the author of the prefatory advertiſement, is the Rev. Mr. Ch-rl s I gl-s, who by this ſtep has adopted the whole work, and thrown on himſelf the burden of the exculpation. Till this be done, I ſhall accordingly treat him as the author of the Vindication. There is indeed one, and but one ſuppoſition againſt this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; and that is, that ſome parts of the performance, may appear to perſons not intimately acquainted with him, to be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a little above his capacity. But whatever agency that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend and very conſtitutional body, the convention, may have had in the compoſition, it being rather diſproportionate to the induſtry of any individual member; Mr. J-gl-s had certainly in the manner above-mentioned, made it his own. His it is <hi>de juro,</hi> let the <hi>de facto</hi> be where it will. The affair being thus far ſettled betwixt us, I ſhall treat him in the progreſs of my reply, as reſponſible for the whole; and ſo with an <hi>all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice apart,</hi> proceed to the buſineſs. But as I find it impoſſible immediately to enter the magnificent ſtructure (ſo I call the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative part) of this maſter-builder, by reaſon of the immenſe rubbiſh with which he has choak'd up the paſſage; I find my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf neceſſitated to clear away the lumber, before I can introduce the reader into the manſion; which, conſidering his hearty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation to ſurvey and examine the edifice, ought in all good conſcience to be done at his own coſts and charges and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhall make him pay a <hi>Quantum meruit,</hi> muſt be ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the verdict of the impartial reader. Among this rubbiſh, I reckon what he fondly deemed wit; of which he has made ſome very vigorous and very aukward efforts.—But of all the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate touches of humour, wherewith the Vindication, like a kind of artificial firmament, is ſo gorgeouſly beſpangled, commend me to the firſt page of the advertiſement, where he declares, that he looks for no <hi>fee</hi> or reward. And ſo fond is he, of this pretty conceit, that in page 18 of the Vindication, he muſt give it a ſecond deliverance. <q>The following character, of theſe people, ſays he, is given by Mr. Neal, who is their profeſſed advocate, tho' I know not that he ever received any <hi>fee</hi> from them.</q> That "Mr. I-gl s looked for no fee or reward," in compiling or publiſhing this voluminous pamphlet, is a fact known only to himſelf, and which therefore I ſhall not be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courtly as to diſpute with him; and the rather as he really might, in his ſerious and humble moments entertain of the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:011212_0159_0F862F09CD8165C0"/>the ſame opinion which the beggar did of the bleſſing of a certain Biſhop, who having refuſed to give him the ſolicited groat, very munificently beſtowed his benediction. Thus there may perhaps be a little equivocation in the matter, and tho' the gentleman may not think himſelf entitled to a reward <hi>ex condigne;</hi> he may expect a ſmall recompence <hi>ex congruo;</hi> and ſo fancy a comfortable deanery, after his Lordſhip's arrival, no great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congruity. But as the word <hi>ſee,</hi> is in the laſt quotation printed in Italic, and in the firſt in capitals, as tho' it was in the moſt intimate alliance with the church (on which Mr. I-gl-s's printer has almoſt worn nine of his capital types) he undoubtedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to inſinuate, that Mr. Livingſton had wrote his letter for a fee. But the whole wit and poignancy of this ſublime ſtroke cannot appear in full luſtre, without being made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, that Mr. Livingſton is of a certain profeſſion, which, for having more than once ſaved this province from utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction, is of late, for certain political reaſons, endeavoured to be rendered very unpopular. Now he being a lawyer, and lawyers being paid for ſerving their employers (which it ſeems is peculiar to them, all the reſt of mankind working for nothing) it therefore follows, that every letter they write, either for their own amuſement, or to ſerve their country or to expoſe the falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods of the miſſionaries, muſt be in expectation of a <hi>ſee.</hi> But doe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Why drop an inſinuation ſo injurious to his neighbour's character, and that had no relation to the matter in conteſt? For if it was of no conſequence to the public, <q>who or what manner of perſon the author of the vindication was;</q> neither was it of the leaſt conſequence, what <hi>fee</hi> or reward the Letter-writer had, or looked for. The only thing material, was the truth or falſhood of what was written, and not the conſideration that gave riſe to the writing. Surely if every one of Mr. I-gl s's ſermons for which he hath received a <hi>ſee,</hi> were upon that account to be deemed heretical, I fear very few of them would be found or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox. But I am well perſuaded, that Mr. Livingſton, neither received or looked for any fee in the caſe; and that if he did, Mr. I-gl-s is the laſt man in the world that ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached him for it.—For pray what is it that this gentleman will do without fee or reward? He certainly received a <hi>ſee</hi> for abandoning the pariſh of Dover, for that of New York; and whether he had ſtomach'd the exchange, had not the latter out-<hi>feed</hi> the former, is beſt known to himſelf. I aſk again, what it
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:011212_0160_0F862F0C16BE28A8"/>is that he will do without fee or reward? Why, he will not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer a man in his pariſh to be born or to die without it. He will neither marry nor bury without it. Yea, for that laſt office of humanity, the interment of the dead, this diſintereſted and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney hating gentleman will cheerfully take a fee; for without fingering the caſh, he muſt be caught in a ſpecial good humour, if he will ſend to heaven even the ſoul of a <q>dear brother departed.</q> Nay, for admitting an infant into the viſible church by baptiſm, he has no objection againſt taking a fee. Thus he will not let an individual creature within his parochial juriſdiction, come into the world, continue in it, or go out of it, without a fee; and what is beyond all toleration, the gentlemen of his fraternity, in this city, make no conſcience of taking fees from both ſides of the queſtion. For they are paid by thoſe of other communions, as well as their own. They take money from people whom they do not ſerve, and who want none of ther ſervices. They receive fees for preaching even from the <hi>clergy</hi> of other denominations, who can preach for themſelves, and whom they are ſo far from preaching for, that they muſt, upon certain occaſions preach againſt. The moſt inglorious fee to be met with, in the whole compaſs of hiſtory! Nay, ſo great a lover of fees is this ſame Mr. I-gl-s, that in conjunction with his good brother of Elizabeth-Town, (who ſays, he has changed his religion for a better, and no doubt from mere principle of conſcience, without looking for an additional fee from the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety) he is for procuring legiſlative acts, to compel the whole province to pay <hi>fees</hi> to a primitive Biſhop, tho' not a twentieth part of it ever intend to become his clients The doctrine of fees, was therefore certainly not a proper topick for the diſplay of his wit; and happy would it be for him, if any of his friends could perſuade him, that wit is not his principal talent.</p>
               <p>But as no man is anſwerable for not being a wit, (wit being as certainly native as religion is not) I have no controverſy with him on that account. But for miſrepreſentation, and falſely citing the words of his adverſary, he is doubtleſs anſwerable; and I think it greatly concerns his reputation to make a ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory anſwer.—Mr. Livingſton, he ſays, tells his Lordſhip, <q>That he queſtions whether there be a pamphlet in the nation, that in proportion to the length of the ſermon, contains ſo great a number of aberrations from the truth.</q> That is, ſays Mr. I-gl-s, in plain Engliſh, ſo great a number of lies. But does this gentleman really believe, that there is no difference between an aberration from the truth, and a lie? If he does, I believe he is the only caſuiſt in the world, who makes every miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, to which human nature is incident, a lie. I have always
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:011212_0160_0F862F0C16BE28A8"/>underſtood, that a man might as well ignorantly as knowingly err from the truth, and that in the latter caſe only, he was chargeable with the guilt of lying. And ſo far is Mr. Living<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton from ſuppoſing, or even inſinuating, that his Lordſhip had knowingly deviated from the truth, without which he could not be guilty of lying, that he expreſsly declares the contrary; and aſcribes his errors to the miſrepreſentations of the miſſionaries. How then hath he charged him with lying? But this is only one of the numerous artifices of the Vindicator to render his antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt odious; and deſerves at leaſt the name of a wilful miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation; and whether that be lying or not, we ſhall ſuſpend our judgment till we are favoured with Mr. I-gl-s's definition of that crime. But in the art and myſtery of falſe quotation, he appears as great an adept, as tho' he had been regularly bred at the feet of the Gamaliel of Elizabeth-Town, whoſe adulterated citations, I ſhall make the ſubject of a particular paper. Mr. Livingſton being as well acquainted as Mr. I-gl-s with the letter from the Lord Juſtices, to Lieutenant-Governor Dummer, reſpecting certain ſynodical proceedings, expreſſed himſelf in the following words, <q>And what may appear extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary to an Engliſh prelate, they (that is the N. England ſynods) have been ſo conducted as never to give any juſt um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage to the civil power.</q> Now as no perſon can be ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, as not to know the difference between juſt umbrage being given and umbrage being unjuſtly taken, by miſrepreſentation and calumny, it is evident that the word juſt, was of the laſt importance in the paſſage cited, and that on the praeterition of it in the quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is founded the whole ſuppoſition of the Letter-writer's er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.—What appears extraordinary in this, ſays Mr. I-gl-s, is that Mr. Livingſton ſhould roundly aſſert, <q>their ſynods never gave any umbrage to the civil power.</q> What appears ſtill more extraordinary, ſay I, is that he ſhould roundly aſſert, that Mr. Livingſton had ſo aſſerted. For pray Sir, why ſo ſlily drop out of the above quotation, the little monoſyllable, juſt? Is it a word particularly obnoxious to thy reverence; or did it unlucki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtand in thy way, in a paſſage which thou couldeſt not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully attack without excluding it from that company in the Vindication, in which it made a very ſignificant figure in the Letter? Upon what very unequal terms a man muſt contend with an antagoniſt who can allow himſelf in ſuch liberties, the intelligent reader cannot be inſenſible; and while he loves and reveres the clergymen, on account of his ſacred function, will naturally deſpiſe the writer for his diſingenuous and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble artifice.</p>
               <p>Another of this gentleman's groſs miſrepreſentations is this:
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:011212_0161_0F862F0C1FFB3D98"/>Mr. Livingſton, ſpeaking of the New-England colonies, ſays, <q>There is not a more virtuous, not a more religious people upon the face of the earth,</q>—which is in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s would inform the public who they are. But when the Reverend Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator comes to obſerve upon this paſſage, he repreſents Mr. Livingſton as ſaying, that they are <q>the moſt virtuous and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious people upon the face of the earth,</q> which in plain Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, is affirming that they ſurpaſs all others.—Such miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations do not happen by accident, and whatever this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man may think, the more conſcientious part of mankind, who hold ſuch practices in the higheſt deteſtation, will not conſider them as ornamental to the clerical character.</p>
               <p>But what has given our author the greateſt offence of all, is, that the Letter-writer ſhould waft (as he calls it) the firſt ſettlers of New-England to heaven. Let us ſee the ebullitions of his wrath upon this occaſion. <q>I defy the moſt flaming panegyriſt among Catholicks, who ſtands forth collected and tranſported, to trumpet aloud the praiſes of ſome departed ſaint, under whoſe guardianſhip he places himſelf, and to whom he intends to pay daily and devout adoration,—to be more florid, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, laviſh, luſcious or extravagant in his encomiums than this gentleman is in his encomiums, on the departed ſaints of New England.</q> What a matchleſs <q>floridity, fervidity, prodigality, mellifluity and pompoſity</q> of expreſſion! In all my life I never knew a man ſo much diſturbed at a few people's going to heaven. But let us ſee what hath thus tranſported this peaceable miniſter of the goſpel Mr. Livingſton, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the firſt adventurers to New-England, ſays, <q>whom we have the greateſt reaſon to believe, have long ſince received the approbation of their and your Lordſhip's final judge.</q> This one would have thought ſo remote from any thing like <q>a popiſh canonization,</q> a practice to which the exerciſes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for the "thirtieth of January," bear a much greater reſemblance) that one is obliged in the judgment of charity, to ſuppoſe that the people whom Mr. I gl-s himſelf allows to have been pious, and whom he inſiſts the Biſhop of Landaff intended thus to caracterize, are now in the manſions of the bleſſed. But it ſeems, that to believe the ſalvation of a Preſbyterian ſoul, however pious, is according to Mr. I-gl-s's creed, downright popery. To ſuppoſe ſuch a ſpirit admitted into the realms above, is to canonize "the departed faints of New England;" and Chriſtian charity is popiſh idolatry. Methinks thoſe who have ſo little that does not look like popery, ſhould be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly

I am really ſorry, that this gentleman by appearing ſo greatly diſcompoſed on bearing of thoſe people's being lodged in heaven, has betrayed a ſpirit that would have been more gratified to have found them ſent elſewhere. But I muſt notwithſtanding, join Mr. Livingſton in believing them in heaven; and happy is it for them, if they are really there, that it is not in Mr. I-gl-s's power to fetch them out.</p>

               <p>THE 27th <hi>Whip</hi> ſeems to be Sq. <hi>T's</hi> maſter-piece. His pretended letters from the <hi>Whig, an independent</hi> and <hi>een oude duytſman</hi> were, the 1ſt. ſo <hi>improbable</hi> not to ſay <hi>impoſſible,</hi> and the two laſt ſo out of character, that his readers have, I dare ſay, long ago diſcovered the forgery; but here he exhibits his <hi>chef d'oeuvre</hi> in the letter ſign'd a DISSENTER. 'Twas neceſſary indeed that his diſſenter ſhould plead for prelacy in ſome places; but, leſt he ſhould be ſuſpected to be the <hi>Whipper</hi> himſelf, Sq. <hi>T.</hi> takes care to make him ſpeak like a <hi>real</hi> diſſenter in others, and, (ſtill more to colour his deceit) even controverts ſome of his ſentiments.

That there is no Law, no Record of our Saviour againſt it: Then, I hope, it will not be thought an unreaſonable Motion, if we humbly deſire thoſe that are in Authority, eſpecially the High Court of Parliament, That it may not be ſacrificed to Clamour or over born by Violence, and though (which God forbid) the greater part of the Multitude ſhould cry, Crucify, Crucify; yet our Governors would be ſo full of Juſtice and Courage, as not to give it up, until they perfectly underſtand concerning Epiſcopacy itſelf, <hi>Quid mali fecit?</hi>

You will not imagine that the Apoſtles, all or any of them, made any Decree for this Change when they were living; or left order for it in any Will or Teſtament, when they were dying. This were to grant the queſtion; to wit; That the Apoſtles, being to leave the Government of the Churches themſelves, and either ſeeing by experience, or fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing by the Spirit of God, the diſtractions and diſorders, which would ariſe from a multitude of equals, ſubſtituted E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcopal Government inſtead of their own. General Councils to make a Law for a general Change, for many Ages there was none. There was no Chriſtian Emperor, no coercive Power over the Church to enforce it. Or, if there had been any, we know no force was equal to the courage of the Chriſtians of thoſe times. Their lives were then at command (for they had not then learnt to fight for Chriſt) but their obedience to any thing againſt his Law was not to be commanded (for they had perfectly learnt to die for him.) Therefore there was no Power then to command this Change; or if there had been any, it had been in vain.</p>

               <p>OUR reverend appellant, by his own confeſſion might have ſaved himſelf the trouble of entering into the controverſy about the divine inſtitution of epiſcopacy, in a country where the non-epiſcopalians are content with the enjoyment of their own ſentiments, without diſturbing the mental repoſe of others, in opinions, however abſurd or irrational. Nor could it any way conduce to the equity or reaſonableneſs of his propoſal, whether epiſcopacy was of divine or human appointment. It was ſufficient for his purpoſe, that ſuch was the government of his church. Of this he was ſo ſenſible that he expreſly declares, <q>It is not neceſſary to enter upon a particular defence of the doctrine, in an undertaking of this nature; ſince our preſent plea is equally valid whether theſe principles are founded rightly or wrongly.</q> Where then the neceſſity of troubling the word with ſo unneceſſary a controverſy; or of repeating what has been advanced a thouſand times, and a thouſand times refuted? How can a <q>brief ſketch of the argument whereby the neceſſity of epiſcopal government is defended,</q> be either uſeful or proper, when they are admitted to be uſeleſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary? But Brother Leaming had wrote a book on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and why ſhould not Dr. Chandler write another? Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly he introduces the darling theme, with the humourous conceit of the uninterrupted ſucceſſion. But as he was confident no mortal wight could refrain from ſmiling at the thoughts of ſo ludicrous an object, we are the leſs obliged to the gentleman for his gracious licence to exert the muſcles of our faces. <q>Men may ridicule (ſays he) the uninterrupted ſucceſſion as they pleaſe.</q> And take my word for it, good Doctor, they will pleaſe to ridicule it as often as any man is pleaſed to mention it. But now let us attend to what no one would have expected from ſo zealous an advocate for human appendages. <q>As Chriſt (ſays our author) is the great founder of the church, ſo he is the only fountain of eccleſiaſtical authority.</q> This is a truth to which all Chriſtians will readily ſubſcribe; and a pity it is, that any of them ſhould ſubſcribe it with ſecret equivocations, or mental reſervations. But how ſuch a poſition is conſiſtent with the principles of any man, who believes, that ſecular potentates as ſuch are inveſted with eccleſiaſtical autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, not only to enjoin rites and ceremonies, but alſo matters of ſaith, I confeſs myſelf at a loſs to conceive. Did this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:011212_0166_0F862F0FE818CD10"/>really believe this fundamental maxim of the Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, according to the plain and evident meaning of the words, down went all obligation of conformity to the law eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed modes of Chriſtian worſhip, like the unſtable fabric which the fool of the goſpel had built on the ſand. If Chriſt hath laid one foundation, pray whom hath he authorized to lay another? If he is the fountain, what have Chriſtians to do with the millions of rivulets that can all be traced up to eccleſiaſtical policy, and never originated from this divine ſource? What bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs have they with that motly junction of king-craft and prieſt-craft, which hath almoſt baniſhed primitive Chriſtianity out of the world? Hay, it is this very perſuaſion of Chriſt's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the great founder of the church, and the only fountain of eccleſiaſtical authority; and their inviolable attachment to it, that has made the Diſſenters ſuffer ſuch grievous perſecutions, for not acknowledging the divine right of epiſcopacy, nor the uſurped power of Biſhops, to inflict temporal pains and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, or to illuminate the conſciences of their fellow-creatures, by afflicting their bodies and picking their pockets. It is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of this, that has reſtrained them from recognizing any man on earth as the head of the Chriſtian church; while the high-church <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lergy have at different times, ſubmitted to the infalibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of an Henry and a Mary, tho' as repugnant in principle as popery and proteſtantiſm.</p>
               <p>But as our author cannot find the epiſcopacy he wants among the laws of Chriſt, he has at leaſt invented a compaſs by which we of the Laity are directed to diſcover it. <q>Whatever general laws (ſays he, ſpeaking of our bleſſed Saviour) he was pleaſed to enjoin, muſt be of indiſpenſible obligation to all his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</q> So far perfectly right! But in what immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, no proteſtant can poſſibly acquieſce. <q>Indeed, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the government of the church, his laws are expreſſed in ſuch general terms, that we muſt have recourſe to thoſe whom he immediately entruſted with the government of his church, for a more particular explanation of them.</q> If this be not downright popery, it is exceeding difficult to determine wherein the formal nature of popery conſiſts. For this very poſition of the laws of Chriſt, being ſo expreſſed, that the Laity are unable to comprehend their meaning, is the very baſis on which the whole enormous babel of the papacy is erected. For that once admitted, and an infallible head of the Chriſtian church is of abſolute neceſſity. And of the two, Papa hath this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

<pb n="323" facs="unknown:011212_0166_0F862F0FE818CD10"/>evident, that the Apoſtles themſelves were the interpreters of ſcripture They were the amanuenſes of the Holy Ghoſt, who leſt no doctrine or precept to their interpretation; much leſs are we<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I ſhould have drawn a very different concluſion from the generality of the laws of Chriſt reſpecting his church. I ſhould never have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined it conſiſtent with the dignity of the divine author of our religion, to expreſs his laws in terms myſtical and ambiguous, merely for the ſake of rendering it neceſſary to have an <q>unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted ſucceſſion of interpreters,</q> to give them a more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular explanation. I ſhould have concluded, that it was to teach us not to lay too great a ſtreſs on any particular form of church government; but to be furniſhed with a perpetual op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of exerciſing our forbearance and charity towards thoſe who differed from us in ſentiment.—It was moſt certainly not that we ſhould make an implicit ſurrender of our judgment and conſciences in matters of religion, to any fallible, political ambitious churchman. It was not to warrant or authorize any of his followers to inflict pains and penalties on his fellow-Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, for not bowing down to mitres; or believing the divine right of human ceremonies. It was not that we ſhould worry one another like wild beaſts, and even ſhed human blood, to compel and enforce for doctrines the commandments of men. It was not in fine to convert the peaceful religion of Jeſus into an engine of violence and oppreſſion; or to authorize any man to challenge as a ſucceſſor to him, <q>who had not where to lay his head,</q> worldly wealth and dignitie, and tythes, and lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, with innumerable other appendages, which I am ſure the Doctor even by the help of the moſt particular explanation, findeth not in the ſacred canon. How extremely fortunate is the Chriſtian church, to be thus prevented from running into fatal errors about the office of a Preſbyter, as explained in the laws of Chriſt, by the particular explanation of thoſe unerring interpreters, the governors of the church, by whom, as by an inerrable pole-ſtar we are directed to find the man, concealed as he is, beneath the robe and the mitre and the lawn ſleeves of the Biſhop. So open an attack on the rights of private judgment, and a doctrine ſo manifeſtly inducing the neceſſity of an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in the clergy, is what I had never expected from the pen of a proteſtant divine. If this arrogant claim of a particular ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation, and in conſequence of it, a right of enforcing it by compulſory means, without which it is vain and ridiculous, is to be part of the Biſhop's errand into this American world, the
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:011212_0167_0F862F10AAD1A3B0"/>Doctor cannot pray more fervently for his ſpeedy arrival, than I do, that he may never, never, never come; to which, if not all, I believe ninety-nine in a hundred of all the people here will ſay, Amen.</p>

Countrymen I find, muſt have their fit of ſcribbling out as well as <hi>Citizens,</hi> and <hi>old</hi> as well as <hi>young</hi> men <hi>contend earneſtly</hi> for the <hi>Church.</hi> Deſiring, it ſeems, that <hi>epiſcopacy</hi> and the <hi>ſtamp-act</hi> ſhould be eſtabliſh'd by the ſame authority, yet reſolving that at leaſt the CHURCH <hi>in America,</hi> ſhall have a repreſentative in paliament, <hi>Roger</hi> (Whip No. XXVIII) gives his ideal advocate inſtructions how to ſpeak in the houſe of commons. <hi>Here,</hi> indeed, when it ſuits a particular purpoſe, we are told that the CHURCH <hi>in America</hi> has no "legal exiſtence," nor any "relation to the ſtate" and only wants the apoſtolical powers of the primitive times; but <hi>Roger's</hi> orator tells the houſe, that, in her <q>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and conſtitution</q> ſhe is ſo connected with the ſtate, that "together both muſt flouriſh, both together falls," affects to "ſhudder" at the thought of "refuſing" her a Biſhop, as a ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and deſtructive meaſure, as tho' <hi>ſhe</hi> (ay, reader, the CHURCH <hi>in America</hi>) were the <hi>Atlas</hi> that ſuſtains the globe, or at leaſt the rock that ſupports the pillars of the Britiſh empire; and for proof (par. 8th) appeals to hiſtory, which can never juſtify ſuch extravagant notions of the CHURCH even in <hi>England</hi> itſelf. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe formerly the Church "ſuffered" with the ſtate in England, he would fain infer, that if even the little CHURCH in America, ſhou'd fall, it muſt involve the ſtate in its ruin. Ha! ha! ha!</p>
               <p>The epiſcopal commoner, is likewiſe made to aſſure the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of parliament, (par. 15th) that <hi>American churchmen</hi> are a mighty loyal peaceable people (ſo they are, at leaſt many of them) and incorruptible as <hi>Milton's</hi> good angels; and yet Roger in his introduction, after grievouſly complaining of the negligence of ſome "in authority," even threatens them with <q>ſome act of deſperation</q> on the part of <hi>American</hi> epiſcopalians, in caſe
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:011212_0167_0F862F10AAD1A3B0"/>the FACTION be allow'd to "triumph," and thoſe who have the honour (forſooth) of being "attach'd to" the ſame form of religion with the "SOVEREIGN" have not a <hi>Biſhop</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulg'd them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Roger</hi> as well as his commoner has a good deal to ſay about FACTION, SCRIBBLERS, <hi>fanaticks, Independants, turbulent ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,</hi> "rock'd in the cradle of ſedition" &amp;c. but <hi>his</hi> comſort, it ſeems, is that the number is but SMALL, and <hi>mine</hi> is, that ſuch hard words, how often ſoever repeated, cannot injure the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>epiſcopal cauſe AT ALL; and ſo <hi>Roger</hi> may e'en light his <hi>pipe,</hi> and I'll lay down my <hi>pen.</hi>

               <p>As you are already engaged in a Controverſy with the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Whig, in generouſly defending Dr. Chandler, and his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, from his rude Inſults, and Miſrepreſentations, you would confer a ſingular Obligation on the Author of the Vindication of the Biſhop of Landaff's Sermon, if you would alſo undertake the Defence of his Pamphlet, which is now attacked by the ſame Writer. It will eaſe the Vindicator of a diſagreeable Office, be all in your Way, and you have ſhewn yourſelf to be equal to the Taſk; beſides, you may ſerve the Cauſe of Truth,— which I am convinced was your Motive when you firſt engaged, —by the one as well as the other. In the mean Time, by giving a Place to the incloſed Advertiſement to the Public, in your next Whip, you will oblige your conſtant Reader, and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Servant, <hi>The Author of the Vindication.</hi>

               <head>Advertiſement to the PUBLIC.</head>
               <p>THE Deſign of the Vindication of the Biſhop of Ladaff's Sermon, in Anſwer to Mr. Livingſton's Letter to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <q>was to reſcue the Character of that worthy, eminent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, from the Odium which the Letter would throw upon it, and juſtify the venerable Society, ſo far as they were charged with Blame,</q> in the ſaid Letter. The Author of the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication profeſſed <q>he would ſet about this, not as an angry Antagoniſt, who aſſumed a Liberty of abuſing and reviling at Pleaſure, juſt as Reſentment or Caprice might dictate; but as a diſpaſſionate Inquirer after Truth, who deſired that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Things might appear in their true and proper Light.</q> What he undertook, he executed, by <q>confining himſelf to Facts, and repreſenting them fairly.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Author appeals to every candid, unprejudiced Perſon, who has peruſed his Pamphlet, whether he has not acted agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his Engagement, and to the Character he aſſumed, of a Lover of Truth and Decency; notwithſtanding the many
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:011212_0168_0F862F1163DBC770"/>Miſrepreſentations, the unprovoked Abuſe and Inſolence, with which Mr. Livingſton's Letter was replete.</p>
               <p>As the Refutation of the ſeveral Charges contained in Mr. Livingſton's Letter, turned chiefly on the Inveſtigation of Facts, for which the Vindicator refered his Readers to the Authorities on which he related them—and as others might, if they choſe it, be aſcertained of their Truth, by turning to thoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities: He conceived it could be a Matter of no Conſequence to the Public, to know who, or what Manner of Perſon he was, Beſides, he judged it improper, as well as beneath him, to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard a Rencounter with a Set of ſcribbling Janizaries, who, to mention no other Inſtances, had ſo groſsly abuſed the Candour and Moderation of Dr. Chandler, in their Attack upon his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal. From ſuch Men, inflamed with Party Rage, and all the dark Paſſions which diſappointed Ambition generally rouſes, what could he expect but the ſame Perſecution his Betters had experienced before him? For notwithſtanding the Invitation and Promiſes, contained in the Advertiſement preſixed to Mr. Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingſton's Letter were ſpecious; yet little Regard was due to them, conſidering that he himſelf was the principal Writer of the American Whig, to paſs over his former Publications of a ſimilar Nature. And indeed his Treatment of the Biſhop of Landaff, who had prefixed his Name to his Sermon, was a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Circumſtance to deter any one who had not the greateſt Confidence in his own Patience, or who was tender of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, from entering into Controverſy with him openly, Theſe Conſiderations induced the Vindicator to conceal his Name. Actuated, as he was, by a Deſire to ſerve the Cauſe of Truth and Religion, and not to embroil himſelf with angry, perſonal Altercations, he endeavoured with all good Faith to diſcharge what he eſteemed to be his Duty. If he has flung in a few Strokes of Humour now and then, they are decent, and were judged proper to keep the Reader's Attention more awake; and if he has interſperſed ſeveral Anecdotes thro' his Pamphlet, they were all pertinent to the Subject, had a manifeſt Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with it—yet ſtill without any Malevolence.</p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſſed, that after the Vindicator had detected ſo many Errors, and refuted ſo many Calumnies in Mr. Living<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton's Letter, the Letter-Writer's Character, as to Veracity and Probity, ſuppoſing him to have had a competent Knowledge of his Subject, did not ſtand in the moſt favourable Point of Light; for this however, he had none to blame but himſelf, as he firſt commenced Hoſtilities. Yet ſtill a Way was left for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat with Honour, and exculpate himſelf with Reputation; making ſome ſmall Abatement for his fond Credulity, The Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator,
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:011212_0169_0F862F12225AC108"/>after ſeeing Dr. Chauncy's Remarks on the Biſhop of Landaff's Sermon, (which was not till after he had finiſhed his Strictures on the Letter to his Lordſhip) charitably ſuppoſed that Mr. Livingſton had been miſled by the garrulous old Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of Boſton. This was the moſt favourable Conſtruction that could be put upon his Conduct; and indeed his Friends thought it the beſt Apology that could be made for him. The Vindicator was willing to think ſo, and doubtleſs the Public would have admitted the Plea.</p>
               <p>But, alas, how often is our Charity miſtaken! Some Spirits are of ſuch a Caſt, that you only make them more untractable, more ſtubborn, by Reaſon. Their Obſtinancy riſes in Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Clearneſs and Strength of your Arguments. You cannot enrage them more, than by ſhewing them they err, Mr. Livingſton was not of a Temper to make any Conceſſions, nor even admit he was fallible. Inſtead of making any Reparation to the Biſhop of Landaff, for the injurious, groundleſs Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies flung upon him, as Truth and Juſtice demanded—inſtead of acknowledging he had been led into any Error by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks: He breathed out Threatnings and Vengeance againſt the Vindicator. His Head indeed was generally ſuppoſed to have received ſome little Damage by this unlucky Bounce againſt the Biſhop. Conſcious of this, and that his Character, as an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, had alſo ſuffered, it ſtung him on to keener Reſentment. For altho' the genius of literary Fame had not given him Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance into her Train, nor even, as it is reported, heard once of his Name, Yet he paid her ſome diſtant Adoration; and to teſtify his Sincerity, had frequently ſacrificed at her Shrine the trifling Conſiderations of Humanity, Decency, Friendſhip, and Truth. All theſe mournful, galling Reflections crowding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on the Mind, were enough to transform a moderate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, much more our American Whig, into an Inquiſitor— even of Blood.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, he came forth, gentle Reader, as you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by caſting your Eye on the American Whig. No. XXXIX. —he came forth, I ſay, with all the tremendous Pomp of of an Inquiſitor—Effrontery and Suſpicion leading the Van, Inſolence and Malice his Aſſeſſors on either Side, whilſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation and fierce Revenge brought up the Rear. Thus ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly accoutred and ſupported, the Rev. Mr. I-ng-l-s became the hapleſs, devoted Victim of his Rage. On a bare Suſpicion that this Gentleman had written the prefatory Advertiſement which is prefixed to the Vindication, he diſcharges the whole Weight of his Reſentment againſt him, and treats him with the loweſt and moſt contemptible Scurrility. Surely this would not
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:011212_0169_0F862F12225AC108"/>be juſtifiable had there been the cleareſt Evidence, even to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that he had written the whole Pamphlet.</p>
               <p>Mr. Livingſton abſurdly makes this Gentleman accountable for every Paſſage in the Vindication, at the very Time he ſays— "Some Parts of the Performance—are rather a little above his Capacity;" and that the Compoſition is rather diſproportionate to the Induſtry of any Individual Member of the Convention," Now this I conceive to be a little hard. If the whole Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was combined to write the Vindication, why ſhould the Blame, if perchance there is any, be thrown upon one? Yea, but Mr. I-gl-s, quoth our Whig, by writing the prefatory Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement, "has adopted the whole Work, and thereby thrown on himſelf the Burden of Exculpation." And Mr. Livingſton, ſay I, wrote the firſt Paper of the American Whig; Is he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore accountable for all the Blunders, Nonſenſe, Falſhoods, Secur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility, Dulneſs, Forgeries, bad Reaſoning, &amp;c. contained in the ſubſequent Papers? Would he not think it unjuſt? The Caſes are parallel. I ſay not this as if Mr. I-ngl—s, need be aſhamed to adopt the Vindication, if the Opinion of others is to be taken; but to expoſe the Futility of the Letter Writer's Reaſoning— Reaſoning indeed is not his Talent—as well as the Injuſtice of his Procedure.</p>
               <p>This ungenerous Attack on Mr. I-ngl-s is the more extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, as he is known to have always entertained the moſt favourable ſentiments of Diſſenters, particularly Preſbyterians, and to have been ſo much attached to them as to incur the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of ſome Members of his own Community on that Account. This Attack is alſo extraordinary, as the Vindication, whether he was the Author or not, is, in the Judgment of every candid, diſpaſſionate Reader of it, that I have converſed with, written with much Temper, and intended only to wipe off the Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that had been flung on the Church of England, and its Members.</p>
               <p>Particular Anſwers ſhall be returned in due Time, to the Papers againſt the Vindication. In the mean Time, I will give the Reader a Specimen of the firſt, which ſeems to be rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as a Vehicle for private Scandal, and to fling Dirt at Mr. I-ngl-s, than a Reply to the Vindication. Mr. Livingſton charges the Vindicator with "falſe quoting," and ſays he dropt the Word <hi>juſt,</hi> in citing a Paſſage from the Letter. If the Reader will be pleaſed to turn to the Vindication, he will find the Paſſage at p. 24; and he will alſo find, to his Aſtoniſhment at the Whig's Effrontery, the Word <hi>juſt</hi> at full Length. I ſhall tranſcribe the Paſſage for the Reader's Satisfaction from the Vindication.—"Again, he, i. e. Mr. Livingſton tells the
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:011212_0170_0F862F12EC0F3C60"/>Biſhop of Landaff,—"Eccleſiaſtical Synods have ever been in uſe among them," i. e. the New England Coloniſts," and what may ſeem extraordinary to an Engliſh Prelate, they have been ſo conducted as never to give any juſt Umbrage to the civil Power." Theſe are the Words exactly as they ſtand in the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication, p. 24.</p>
               <p>In the very next Sentence, the Mode of anſwering, adopted by the Vindicator, led him to repeat the Subſtance of the Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when for Brevity's Sake, ſeveral Words were omitted; and among others the Word <hi>juſt.</hi> But was it not laid before the Reader in the Quotation? Or did this alter the State of the Caſe? Not in the leaſt. The violent Proceedings of the New-England Synods gave Umbrage to the civil Power,—the Lords Juſtices wrote to Governor Dummer, about them, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid their meeting. Theſe Facts the Whig cannot deny.</p>
               <p>Perhaps he will ſay there was no juſt Umbrage given to the civil Power. Yea, but who is to judge? Shall he judge for the civil Power, or ſhall the civil Power judge for itſelf? Moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Lords Juſtices thought that juſt Umbrage was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, or elſe they would not have written to Mr. Dummer.</p>
               <p>From this Specimen the Reader may judge what Sort of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Vindication is to have. Mr. Livingſton affirms the Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicator dropt the Word <hi>juſt,</hi> tho' in Truth he quoted it; and I obſerve he cautiouſly avoids ſetting down the Page of the Vindication, as few Readers may be able to remember where the Paſſage lies, and turning to it would detect his Miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. How wretched muſt the Cauſe be which requires ſuch Artifices to ſupport it? And what Kind of a Heart muſt he have, that can uſe ſuch Artifices!</p>
               <p>Indeed this Method of anſwering Pamphlets by detached weekly papers, is as unſair as it is unprecedented, and argues want of Ability in the Writer, or elſe a bad Cauſe. It is much eaſier to ſit down and write a ſhort, flimſy Piece, made up chiefly of Perſonal Invective and private Scandal, which will not fail to catch vulgar Ears; than to write a Pamphlet where Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and cloſe Reaſoning are neceſſary. The Whig however, like moſt Animals, knows no doubt where his Strength lies; and his Exhibitions often remind me of the Feats of Punch, placed in a Window, to draw the Rabble to ſee a Pup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet Show. To do the Whig Juſtice, I believe his Abilities for Reaſoning are much on a Level with his Courage and Heroiſm; as he generally makes his valiant Attacks on your paſſive Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtics, who are reſtrained at leaſt by a Regard to their Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, from making ſuch Repriſals as Laymen would be apt to make, and for which he ſeems to have no Stomach. But he
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:011212_0170_0F862F12EC0F3C60"/>certainly ought to have conſidered, before he ſat down to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madvert on Characters, whether his own be invulnerable. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his own Doctrine, "Recrimination is juſt." The Vindicator aſſures him he will make no Return in the Way of Scandal, or raking into his private Character. As a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he deſpiſes it, as a Chriſtian he deteſts it. He has no Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to excel in the Manners, Flowers, or Style of Billingſgate, —to the Whig's more maſterly Genius and Pen, he leaves ſuch Things. But be will not be anſwerable for what others may think proper to do with Regard to Characters.</p>
               <p>After the Whig has made his firſt foul Diſcharges, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable his Stomach may be eaſier, and his Head more cool,— Evacuations being generally attended with ſuch Effects. Should this fortune to be the Caſe, and a Regard to Truth and Decency, gain the Aſcendant a little, his Reply to the Vindication ſhall be noticed accordingly; if not by 'Squire Tickle, yet by the Vindicator himſelf The Author declares he will defend the Vindication no farther than the Vindication defends Truth. If in any Inſtance it is plainly ſhewn, that the Vindicator was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and thereby erred,—for knowingly or wilfully he erred not—he will immediately acknowledge and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract it.</p>
               <p>But he humbly requeſts the Whig, alias, Mr. Livingſton, that, if poſſible, he would be decent,—that he would quote fairly,—that he would not torture Words, nor endeavour to wreſt them from their natural, obvious Senſe,—and that he would not endeavour by Sophiſtry, to caſt a Miſt before the Reader's Eyes, in order to obſcure the Truth. Moreover, he ſubmits it to the Whig's moſt ſage Conſideration, whether for his own Sake,—verily not for Mr. I-gl-s's, whoſe moral religious Character is very well known, and above the Reach of his Malice, or that of any other Dirt-Flinger,—whether for his own Sake, I ſay, meaning and refering to the Whig, he ſhould not be ſomewhat tender and delicate when treating of private Characters. Becauſe, whatever be may loſe in the Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of ſome Folks, with reſpect to his being a frolickſome, waggiſh Companion,—whatever Abatement there might be of the Savage Pleaſure which others would take in reading ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniating Inſults on their Neighbours,—a Pleaſure which we are to ſuppoſe the Whig never taſted—: All this will be fully made up in clear Gain to his Character, as a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and a Chriſtian. Add to this, that as the Subject has ſome Connection with Religion, it would be quite as well to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon more, and rail leſs. The Premiſes being complied with by the Whig, ſhall be ſacredly obſerved by the Vindicator. Should
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:011212_0171_0F862F13A01EBF70"/>Squire Tickle think proper to engage, he ought to do the ſame; but if he deviates from them, e'en let him be kicked, or buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or abuſed, as ſeemeth moſt meet unto the meek minded Whig.</p>
               <p>Theſe Preliminaries being adjuſted and adhered to, Mr. Liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingſton may proceed with his Reply as faſt as he will. But he muſt not think to impoſe on the World, by calling ſuch Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers as his XXXIXth No. which conſiſts chiefly of ſhameleſs Scolding, and miſrepreſents two or three Words and Paſſages in the Vindication;—he muſt not think. I ſay, to impoſe on the World by calling ſuch Papers, Anſwers or Replies to the Vindication. A free, ſenſible People, will diſcern better; they will treat with Indignation, ſo palpable, ſo outrageous an Inſult on their Underſtanding.</p>

<pb n="333" facs="unknown:011212_0171_0F862F13A01EBF70"/>epiſcopate. The whole tenor of his Appeal repreſents every ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument in favour of religion, as favourable to his own ſcheme; and that religion itſelf muſt neceſſarily ſink or ſwim, according as it ſhall fare with his darling prelacy. It is evidently the light in which he has repreſented the caſe, that there can be no church of Chriſt in this country, nor any real Chriſtianity among us, in any other way than by introducing the epiſcopal conſtitution. The moſt conſcientious worſhip of God, and the ſtricteſt profeſſion and practice of the religion of Jeſus Chriſt in the preſbyterian form, is, in his view of the caſe, the moſt brutal profligacy of manners, and equal to the higheſt degree of infidelity that is to be found, even among the groſſeſt barbarians: Yea, that it is a ſcandalous neglect, and what brings great and deſerved reproach upon the civil authority of the nation, to ſuffer us in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſo to continue. Indeed it was his deſign, that the ſentiments ſhould, for the preſent, be concealed from public view; yet, (as much upon his guard as he was) his incautions pen has referred us to one who has ſpoken his ſentiments with more freedom.— He tells us in page 10, of his advertiſement. "That it gives him great pleaſure to find that his ſentiments have been ſo clearly and forcibly expreſſed, by the right reverend Lord Biſhop of Landaff, in his excellent anniverſary ſermon preached before the ſociety in February laſt."—The ſermon here reſerred to, ſufficiently juſtifies me in the repreſentation I have given of the Doctor's ſentiments of religion. Eſpecially in page 6, of that ſermon, we find theſe notable expreſſions.—"Since the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the new world, the ſame proviſion hath not been made of miniſters neceſſary to the ſupport of Chriſtianity, among thoſe who removed thither; eſpecially in the Britiſh colonies.—A ſcandalous neglect, (this, of not making a proviſion of miniſters) which hath brought great and deſerved reproach, both on the adventurers, and on the government whence they went, and under whoſe protection and power they ſtill remain in their new habitations. To the adventurers, what reproach could he caſt heavier than they deſerve? Who with their ſoil abandoned their native manners and religion, and e'er long were found in many parts, living without remembrance or knowledge of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any divine worſhip, in diſſolute wickedneſs, and the moſt brutal profligacy of manners, inſtead of civilizing and convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing barbarous infidels, as they undertook to do, they became themſelves infidels and barbarians."—In theſe ſtrong expreſſions, does the Biſhop repreſent our forſaking the epiſcopal conſtitution, and ſetting up and pactiſing the preſbyterian form of church order, to be the abandoning the Chriſtian religion, and living without remembrance or knowledge of God, in diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute wickedneſs, and the moſt brutal profligacy of manners;
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:011212_0172_0F862F1463AC5EB8"/>yea, as becoming infidels and barbarians. And it is here called a ſcandalous neglect of the authority of the Britiſh nation, which brings great and deſerved reproach upon them, to ſuffer us, in theſe plantations to continue ſuch infidels and barbarians, as to remain in the practice of preſbyterianiſm, which is here ſtiled wickedneſs.</p>
               <p>This ſermon, Dr. Chandler calls an excellent one, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiceth to find his own ſentiments ſo clearly and forcibly expreſſed in it. I have therefore his own authority for conſidering this repreſentation, which the Biſhop gives of this country, as his own; from which, notwithſtanding all that moderation and ſhew of candour with which he makes a parade in the Appeal, it appears that in his view of the caſe, preſbyterianiſm has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Chriſtianity in it; yea, that it is the moſt diſſolute wickedneſs, by which we make ourſelves infidels and barbarians. And altho' he would fain perſuade us to believe, that he his no deſign to give the leaſt diſturbance to ſuch as are of any other denomination, by the introduction of Biſhops; yet how ready is he to accuſe the King and parliament of a ſcandalous neglect, and as expoſing them to great and deſerved reproach, for not interpoſing their authority for our recovery, from this diſſolute wickedneſs of preſbyterianiſm. What ſincerity can there be in his repeated and poſitive declarations, that he aims not at any thing beyond the harmleſs, enfeebled and diſarmed creature of a Biſhop, which ſtands deſcribed in his Appeal? Can we believe him that he deſires the authority of the nation, ſhould continue in ſuch a practice, which he looks upon as a ſcandalous neglect! Or is it not evidently his aim to introduce epiſcopacy, as a leading ſtep to engage the civil ſword, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert us from the barbarous infidelity of preſbyterianiſm to the Chriſtian faith, which is to be found only in the prelatic church? It is evidently in this view of the caſe, that he pleads for the neceſſity of Biſhops in this country, repreſenting throughout his Appeal, that there can be no real church, or Chriſtianity among us upon any other footing, and that every argument than can be urged in favour of religion, muſt be underſtood as being in favour, and as ſhewing the neceſſity of his ghoſtly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</p>
               <p>It is plain the Biſhop of Landaff could collect his account of this country from no public hiſtory that has ever been written, it being diametrically oppoſite to every other account of us, that has been ever publiſhed to the world. The only medium of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence from whence he can be ſuppoſed to collect it, muſt be private correſpondence. And as the Dr. has ſo freely declared, that he finds his own ſentiments of us plainly expreſſed by the
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:011212_0172_0F862F1463AC5EB8"/>Biſhop, it is but doing him juſtice to eſteem him the perſon to whom the Biſhop is indebted for his information. And to ſpeak the truth, it muſt be confeſſed, the account he has given of us to the Biſhop of Landaff, is as near the truth, as uſually are the accounts tranſmitted by him and his brother miſſionaries, to the ſociety which employ them. The Dr. makes frequent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of perſecution, repreſenting his party and his cauſe as being heavily loaded with it. And yet, not a man on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent can ſhew any thing this gentleman had to preſent the idea of perſecution to his mind, unleſs it be the pleaſing forethought of being ſoon able to make uſe of the convincing arguments of confiſcation and faggot, for the converſion of preſbyterians. A ſpirit of bigotry this, not inferior to that which once blazed in that fiery prelate Arch biſhop Laud, whoſe character will ſtand mark'd with indelible infamy, as long as the Britiſh annals ſhall endure, for his more than brutal ſavageneſs towards his fellow creatures, cloak'd under the ſpecious maſk of religion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted with a pious zeal for the church. All that the Biſhop of Landaff, or Dr. Chandler himſelf want, in order to ſhine with the ſame luſtre, is only to arrive at the ſame meridian. Bigotry and ſuperſtition are, in our fallen ſtate, the natural product of that tendency to religion, implanted in human nature, in its rectitude, which prompts to this inquiry, "Wherewith ſhall I come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord." And altho' the kind father of the univerſe, has been pleaſed, by the medium of divine revelation, to give us needful direction; yet, miſtaking the true ſcope of the divine precept, while confident of having divine revelation for our guide; the tendency of our nature to religion, fills us with zeal, and we become furiouſly mad, verily thinking we are doing God ſervice; while we are really fighting againſt Heaven. A notable inſtance of this enthuſiaſm we have in the Britiſh annals, which gave riſe to the firſt ſettlement of America, in the reigns of thoſe two weak princes, James I. and Charles I. who by deſigning men, were eaſily perſuaded to become tools to prieſtly tyranny. While ſome were endeavouring to reſtore popiſh ſuperſtition, others were aiming at exalting the prelatic church, to as formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable an height as the Pope himſelf. By theſe united ſchemes, ſo fierce a fire was kindled in the nation, as rendered that region too hot for ſuch of its inhabitants as conſcientiouſly govern'd their conduct, and worſhipped their maker with a goſpel ſpirit, and obliged them to ſeek ſhelter among the ſavages of America, whom they found more hoſpitable than the dignified prelates of their native ſoil. And altho' this perſecuting ſpirit of bigotry has been ſo often expoſed, by writers of all denominations; yet how ſurpriſingly does this <hi>ignis <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And unleſs juſt Heaven ſhall blaſt their malevolent ſcheme, it will be neceſſity for us to look out for the diſcovery of another new world, in which we may take ſhelter from the approaching ſtorm, as our fore fathers did in this.</p>

               <p>THE grand ſcope of the <hi>American Churchman</hi> (Whig No. 25) was to exculpate the generality of American Churchmen, of all concern in the late prelatical ſcheme; but the grand ſcope of the TRUE <hi>Churchman</hi> (as he calls himſelf) <hi>Whip</hi> No. 29. ſeems to be to prove (if poſſible) that thoſe who dare preſume to diſſent from his MAJESTY's and the <hi>national</hi> religion, are diſloyal ſubjects.

From the <hi>cup of cold water</hi> mentioned by our Saviour, he wou'd infer (par. 8.) the neceſſity of a fat <hi>warm</hi> benefice; from his orders by his Apoſtles, that thoſe <hi>"who preach the goſpel ſhou'd live by the goſpel"</hi> and <hi>be gives to hoſpitality</hi>" he wou'd fain argue, that they ought to have <hi>palaces</hi> to receive, and plumb pudding to entertain ſtrangers; and by the proviſion made (under the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> theocracy) for the prieſts, that they might not be oblig'd to meddle with <hi>ſecular buſineſs</hi> (par. 9.)

               <p>That the aim of the <hi>convention</hi> (vid. <hi>Whip</hi> No. 30.) is to "ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugate the colonies to the tyranny of prieſts," we acknowledge has never <hi>as yet</hi> been publickly <hi>demonſtrated,</hi> by "producing and proving" a plan different from that pretended, or publiſhing any of the petitions which have taken wing.—Such things as theſe will perhaps beſt anſwer as a <hi>Corps de reſerve.</hi> However that one chief deſign of an epiſcopate, is, to keep us, "inſolent, republican" coloniſts in order, is pretty plain from the <hi>Yankey</hi>-Zealot's letter publiſh'd (unexpectedly to him no doubt!) in the <hi>Whig</hi> No. XX. But words and papers out of the queſtion, <hi>actions, actions, actions!</hi> Mr. T.

And this is a ſufficient anſwer to thy five firſt wiſe parts (Whip No. 30.)—I catch a fellow in my parlour, fumbling at my bureau, ſuſpect him of, and charge him with evil deſigns, —and he challenges me to <hi>prove</hi> it!—Ha! ha! ha!</p>
               <p>The <hi>A. C.</hi> had ſaid, that in <hi>Virginia,</hi> "the <hi>public proviſion</hi> extended only to two churches in a county," the <hi>T. C</hi> declares, that "the leaſt counties <hi>have</hi> two and the moſt of them three churches" How far this declaration is <hi>true,</hi> or (as deſign'd to be underſtood) <hi>contradictory,</hi> I cannot determine: Certain it is however, that "there may be more churches than there is <hi>public proviſion</hi> for; and that the difference of two and three is too ſmall, ſuppoſing the <hi>A. C.</hi> miſtaken, to deſtroy the propriety of his obſervation, viz. that the <hi>epiſcopalians of Virginia</hi> "pay not a <hi>blind</hi> devotion to their clergy." But <hi>blind</hi> indeed muſt be their eyes who from the ſociety's words, "upon renewed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances from Governor's of provinces, miniſters, veſtries and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate perſons, &amp;c."—can infer that a majority of American epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians had ſolicited an epiſcopate, and "wide indeed muſt be their throats," who can "ſwallow" the <hi>T. C's</hi> windy boaſts and improbable declarations.</p>
               <p>Diſpleas'd with the picture of American churchmen, drawn by the <hi>A.C.</hi> out <hi>T. C.</hi> gives us another as much beyond, as that
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:011212_0174_0F862F175E45BD98"/>can poſſibly be ſuppos'd ſhort of the life. We are at once tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into a fairy land, and every churchman, by the extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant touches of his pencil, appears ſcarce leſs than a little divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. If the <hi>A C.</hi> has been deficient in his commendations, he is accus'd as an accuſer of the brethren (for <hi>generous donation is</hi> it ſeems, <hi>inconſiſtent with frugal aeconomy, &amp;c.</hi>) and if, for want of ſkill in painting, he has fail'd of a likeneſs he is charg'd with aiming at, the groteſque ſtyle (unconſcionable this!)

               </p>
               <p>I OBSERVE that Mr. S-b-r-y, as I ſuppoſe, in his Paper, printed in the New-York Gazette of July 4, very decently for a clergyman, gives Dr. Chauncey the lie, for aſſerting, as he ſays, that all candidates for holy orders, in the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, have the expences of their voyage home paid by the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, &amp;c." It would not have been impertinent, if this declai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer againſt falſehood, had mentioned ſome paſſage in the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's anſwer, referring to the page, wherein he affirms this for fact—Till he is pleaſed to do this, I ſhall take the liberty to think that the Dr. has affirmed no ſuch thing. He has indeed affirmed "that the ſociety has publickly given an invitation to all the colony-ſtudents, who deſire Epiſcopal ordination to come to England aſſuring them that their expences in going to, and returning from thence, ſhall be defrayed by the ſociety;" and he has faithfully referred his readers to the very abſtract and page, in which this invitation and promiſe are contained. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which I might aſk this ſtickler for impartiality in writing, whether it was fair dealing to keep ſo important a fact entirely out of ſight? Let him, if he can aſſign ſome better reaſon for his paſſing it over in ſilence, than his not knowing what to do with it. He probably knows, if he does not, I now tell him, till he is able to prove, that the ſociety never publiſhed the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove cited invitation and promiſe, or that they have ſince pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed their revocation of them, the world will judge, and are authorized to judge, that they are bound in ſtrict juſtice to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray the expence any young ſtudents, who go to England for Epiſcopal ordination, are put to on this account, unleſs it is
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:011212_0175_0F862F17694C8A50"/>paid in ſome other way. This is all the Dr. wanted, or had in view, in order to a full proof of the point in debate, namely, that the want of a Biſhop in America was no great hardſhip to candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates, on account of the expence that would ariſe from their croſſing the atlantic. This might be galling to our correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent with '<abbr>Eſq</abbr> Tickle, and the true reaſon, at bottom, of his rude and injurious reflections on the Dr.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant, that the ſociety, for ſome time, have not defrayed the expence of voyages to England for holy orders. And why? becauſe there was no need of it; as this expence has been paid, not by the candidates themſelves, but by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, who expect the benefit of their labours, or by private donations from other perſons here, who wiſh the growth of the church, or by the joint contributions of both. Very few, if any, candidates, I have reaſon to know, have, for many years, gone from this part of the country for ordination, but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of their voyages have been provided for in one or other of thoſe ways. I have myſelf been frequently called upon for help in ſuch caſes, and have always been free to afford it. And as the expence of candidates has been borne by others, and in order to leſſen the diſburſements of the ſociety, which would otherwiſe have been claimable, and muſt in honour and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience have been paid by them, the Doctor's argument remains ſtrong, and cannot be invalidated.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not think it improper to let this over-zealous writer know, that I am not only a ſon of the church of England, a real hearty friend to its growth and proſperity, but one who has the honour of being a member of the incorporated ſociety, for the propagation of the goſpel in foreign parts. I am alſo a friend to decency, good manners, and a becoming treatment, eſpecially of reſpectable characters; and what is more, I am a friend to truth and honeſt impartiality: and as I am fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that the repreſentation the ſociety have had from this ſide the water are, in many inſtances, not only unfair, but no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly falſe; I am obliged to ſay, what I really think, that the greateſt occaſion we, at preſent, have for a Biſhop in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, is to correct and keep in order ſuch troubleſome perſons as this aſſociate with The American Whig Whipper, appears to be, who with ſome others of the like malevolent ſpirit, have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinently diſturbed the quiet of this country for ſometime paſt.</p>
               <p>B. W.</p>
               <p>I was ſo little conſcious of deſerving the malevolent Strictures and falſe Inſinuations contained in this Letter, that had there
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:011212_0175_0F862F17694C8A50"/>been another Clergyman in this, or either of the neighbouring Colonies, whoſe Name thus gutted, would have anſwered to S-b-r-y in the Letter, I ſhould have had no Suſpicion that it was intended for me. But as I found myſelf ſo particularly pointed out, I took the firſt Opportunity of calling on Mr. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, to ſee the original Letter. Mr. Parker ſhewed me a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Paper, ſigned only B. W. and dated at Boſton. I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately took Notice that the Direction at the Head of this writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Paper. "To Mr. James Parker, &amp;c." and I think the Date at Boſton were in a different Hand and Ink, from the other Writing. Upon my expreſſing my Surpriſe, that he ſhould produce this Paper, ſigned only B. W. as an original Letter "from a Gentleman, of Figure in Boſton,"—and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding of him who the Author was, Mr. Parker, after ſome Shuffling, and Heſitation, named Benning Wentworth, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> late Governor of the Province of New-Hampſhire, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor; and affirmed that the written Paper he then ſhewed me, was his Hand Writing. Being aſked by me whether he, (Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker) had received the written Paper, ſigned B. W. from the late Governor Wentworth;—he replied, that he himſelf did not receive it; but that it was ſent by Dr. Chauncey, of Boſton, to ſome Gentlemen of this City, to be publiſh a his Paper; and that if I denied or doubted its being the Hand Writing of the late Governor Wentworth, he was ready to prove it.— Comparing in my Mind, Mr. Parker's Anſwers, and the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that the Direction at the Top of the wrriten Paper, was in a different Hand and Ink, from the other Writing. I could not help ſuſpecting that there was ſome Fraud or Forgery in the Caſe: And finding from Mr. Parker's frequent Shiftings and Shuflings, that he was not a proper Perſon to be converſed with alone on ſuch an Occaſion;—after telling him, that he had in no wiſe complied with his own Preamble to the Letter he had printed,—that I doubted its being the late Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Wentworth's, and that he ſhould be applied to about it, I left him.</p>
               <p>As Mr. Parker had told other Perſons that the Letter ſigned B. W. was written by the late Governor Wentworth, a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of Character in this City, had, before I came to Town, written to a Friend of his at Portſmouth, concerning the Affair; his Friend's Anſwer incloſed the following Letter from the late Governor Wentworth to him, viz.</p>

               <p>After I had ſeen this Letter from Mr. Wentworth. I again called on Mr. Parker, in Company with a Gentleman of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Credit, in order to obtain a ſecond Sight of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in his Poſſeſſion, that I might compare the Writing, with the Letter from Mr. Wentworth. Mr. Parker complained that I had not, when I was laſt at his Houſe, treated him like a Gentleman; and then he rummaged over a Box of Papers, and and ſaid he could not find it; but he repeatedly declared that the Letter ſigned B. W. and publiſhed in his News-Paper, was written by Benning Wentworth, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and tranſmitted to New York by Dr. Chauncey, of Boſton, with a Direction to have it printed in his Paper. Upon my deſiring him to produce his Proofs, which in a former Converſation he had ſaid he could give, that the Letter publiſhed by him was written by Mr. Wentworth, he replied,—that he was obliged immediately to attend a Corpſe into the Country, and therefore had not Time, but that if I doubted the Authenticity of the ſaid Letter, if I would go to Mr. Thomas Smith, Attorney at Law, he had ſuch Proofs in his Hands as would effectually convince me; for that Mr. Smith had received it from Dr. Chauncey, whom he ſuppoſed I would eſteem a Man of Veracity.</p>
               <p>From Mr. Parker I went, in Company with the ſame Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who was with me at Mr. Parker's, to Mr. Thomas Smith. Upon metioning my Buſineſs, and telling him that Mr. Parker had declared that Mr. Wentworth was the Author of the Letter ſigned B. W. and that it was Mr. Wentworth's Hand Writing; and that Mr. Parker had ſaid that he received the Letter from him, and had referred me to him for the Proofs that the Letter was Mr. Wentworth's;—he replied, that he had indeed given the ſaid Letter to Mr. Parker to be printed, that he received it from Mr. Rogers, who recieved it incloſed in a Letter from Dr. Chauncey, who received <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t from the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman himſelf in Boſton;—that it was no Mr. Wentworth's own Hand Writing, for that Mr. Wenworth was an old Man and could not write; but that it was written by his Order, and that he ſigned B. W. to it, and gave it to Dr. Chauncey who incloſed it to Mr. Rogers, who delivered it to him (Thomas Smith) who put it into the Hands of James Parker, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:011212_0176_0F862F1841EA2C60"/>printed it in his Paper. I obſerved upon th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, that Mr. Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth did not live in Boſton. To which Mr. Smith replied, that he was in Bo on at that Time, and that if it would be any Satisfaction to me, if I would wait till the following Week, an Affidavit would arrive from Boſton, to prove that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was the Author of the ſaid Letter</p>
               <p>As I obſerved that Mr. Smith cautiouſly avoided mentioning Mr. Wentworth's Name, but always expreſſed himſelf by the Term—the Gentleman, I ſuſpected that all was not fair, I therefore preſſed him more cloſely, and then he ſaid that one Reaſon why he thought the Letter to be written by Mr. Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, was, that B W. were the initial Letters of no other Name on the Societies Liſt of Members, but of Mr. Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth's only.—As I went out of Mr. Smith's Office. I told him that I had ſuch Proofs in my Pocket, that Mr. Wentworth was not the Author, as would ſurpriſe him and all concerned.</p>
               <p>After we came into the Street, I inſiſted, that as Mr. Smith had been ſo very officious, as to go between Mr. Rogers, and Mr. Parker, in the Affair of printing the Letter ſigned B. W. in which I thought myſelf very cruelly and unjuſtly treated, he ought in Juſtice to procure me a Sight of Dr. Chauncey's Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to Mr. Rogers. Mr. Smith replied that I might take what Steps I pleaſed; that he would give himſelf no Trouble about it, unleſs he chanced to ſee Mr. Rogers; and that he never had told Mr. Parker, or any other Perſon, that the Letter ſigned B. W. was written by Mr. Wentworth.</p>
               <p>I forgot to mention, that in my Converſation with Mr. Parker, when I told him that he had not complied with his Promiſe in the Introduction which he had printed to the Letter ſigned B. W. he anſwered, That he did not write that Introduction; that he objected to its being printed, and that therefore he did not think himſelf obliged by it,—or Words to that Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>From Mr Smith's, I immediately went to Mr. Roger's Houſe, but he was from Home, on a Journey into New-Jerſey, tho' ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to return that Night, or in the Morning. I called again, two or three Times the next Day, but he had not returned. The next Week I ſet out on a Journey, to Philadelphia, and when I returned, Mr. Rogers was gone into New-England, ſo that I had no Opportunity of ſeeing him till ſome Time in Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Upon my mentioning my Buſineſs to him, he behaved with great Openneſs and Candour; readily gave me a Sight of Dr. Chauncey's Letter to him. He without Heſitation alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that he did not know, and never had heard who wrote the Letter ſigned B. W. That when he was lately in Boſton,
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:011212_0177_0F862F19914F9848"/>Dr. Chauncey mentioned the Matter, but did not chuſe to make known the Author's Name.</p>
               <p>In Dr. Chauncey's Letter to Mr. Rogers, according to the beſt of any Recollection, (for Mr. Rogers did not think himſelf at Liberty to permit any Extracts to be taken from it) he ſays, That the Letter ſigned B. W. was written by an Inhabitant of the Town of Boſton; an Epiſcopalian by Principle and Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and for ſeveral Years paſt a Member of the Society for the Propagation of the Goſpel;—that it was written volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily, and unſolicited by him, and put into his Hands for him to make what uſe he pleaſed of it; that the Author wrote it with a View of exculpating him (Chauncey) from an Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Falſhood, in a Paper publiſhed in Mr. Gaine's Gazette, and Weekly Mercury, July the 4th.</p>

               <p>THOUGH fixed in a private ſtation of life, I have not been a careleſs obſerver of what paſſeth in public; nor do I look upon myſelf unconcerned in debates affecting privileges of a civil, but more eſpecially, of a religious nature. I could not look on the late tumults and commotions, occaſioned through theſe colonies, by the unhappy Stamp-Act, without the moſt tender concern, knowing the conſequences (ever to be dreaded) of a rupture between the mother country and theſe plantations; which is an event never to be deſired by thoſe who are true friends to either. A real friend of the nation or its colonies, ought therefore to be ſenſibly alarmed at every thing which has the remoteſt tendency to increaſe the jealouſy, or weaken the connection between them.—Pardon me then, my brethren, if it ſhould appear to be without juſt foundation, that the vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous efforts lately made, to obtain an American epiſcopate, have excited my fears, and prevailed on me, in this manner, to uſe my
<pb n="345" facs="unknown:011212_0177_0F862F19914F9848"/>endeavours to awaken the attention of ſuch as are united in the ſame religious intereſt with myſelf. My apprehenſions on this occaſion, I muſt confeſs, are various; not being fully ſatisfied as to the true cauſe of thoſe endeavours, nor the end really aimed at. Altho' I muſt profeſs the ſincereſt regard for the epiſcopal church in America, and heartily deſire to ſee it bleſſed with all its moſt ample goſpel-privileges; yet whether the la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e attempts to procure American Biſhops, take their riſe from friends to the church, or ſecret enemies to both church and ſtate, appears to me an uncertainty. Whoever conſiders the jealouſy of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſpecting its colonies, as being deſirous to throw off their dependence upon the mother country; and the mutual jealouſies between the nation and its colonies, ſo lately excited by the Stamp-Act, cannot far of being alarmed, leſt ſome evil-deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, taking the advantage of the credulity of ſome of our well meaning clergy, have ſtirred up their well intended, but ill-timed zeal, earneſtly to ſolicit the obtaining Biſhops among ourſelves. An event, which, ſhould it happen, would ſo evidently leſſen the dependence, and weaken the connection of theſe colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies with the crown. It is ſaid, there are more than a million of ſubjects, diſperſed through the plantations, profeſſed members of our excellent church, who are all connected with the nation, not only by civil ties, in common with thoſe of other denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations; but in addition thereto are ſtrongly united by the ſacred ties of religion, being in ſubjection to, and dependent upon the Biſhops in the mother country. Of this the able ſtateſmen of the nation, cannot but be ſenſible; and from principles of ſtate-policy, they muſt oppoſe the deſign.—In what light then, will they view thoſe ſtrenuous efforts for an American epiſcopate, but as a ſecret deſign, cloak'd with the ſpecious pretence of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to ripen our circumſtances for a revolt? Nor will our warmeſt proteſtations of loyalty to the crown, avail to prevent ſuch apprehenſions concerning us, while the thing we are aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at, whether it be our intention or not, really has ſuch a tendency.</p>
               <p>Theſe, my dear countrymen and brethren, were my apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions till the late "Appeal" to the public, fell into my hands; on the reading of which, I was greatly ſurpriſed, more eſpecially at the character there given of the Biſhop ſought after, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for us. A Biſhop that ſhould have power only to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,—to ordain,—and to govern none but the clergy! One that ſhould have nothing to do with us who are in lay-commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſave only to confirm!—How different this from the character of a ſcripture Biſhop, as we have always been taught! —And how far from being able to anſwer the great and
<pb n="346" facs="unknown:011212_0178_0F862F1AE60B0380"/>good ends of religion among us!—are there none but our clergy, that ſtand in need of the godly diſcipline of the church; And muſt we of the laity be as ſheep going a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> to the fold? Is not the diſcipline of the church, of divine appointment, to be a guard to our virtue, to quicken and ſtrengthen us in maintaining Chriſtian watchfulneſs over ourſelves, and for our recovery to repentance after a relapſe? I ſhould be content with a Biſhop ſtript of thoſe temporal dignities, which by the law of the nation, have been ſuperadded to that office: But one diveſted of ſuch an eſſential part of the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity given him by the goſpel, appears to me really worſe than none at all; becauſe he muſt neceſſarily ſoon fall into contempt, and the credit of religion, eſpecially the credit of the epiſcopal perſuaſion, ſink with him.</p>
               <p>That the Biſhop intended for us, ſhould be ſuch a maimed, incomplete creature, was, to me, really ſupriſing and unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, till by a more attentive view of the whole diſcourſe, I was alarmed with ſhrewd marks of a covered deſign in the ſcheme. —The reaſon which is there held up to public view, is to prevent our deſign of having Biſhops from being oppoſed by our neighbours of other religious denominations. But however plauſible and catholick this, at firſt ſight, may appear, yet I am perſuaded any one who attentively conſiders the matter will, with me, be fully convinced, that this is only uſed as a palliative, whild a latent project is carried on, either againſt them, or againſt us. If the ſecret aim is levelled againſt our neighbours of other perſuaſions, to lull them aſleep, and prevent their oppoſing our ſcheme of getting an American epiſcopate, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in ſuch an inoffenſive and harmleſs ſhape hoping after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to have him the more eaſily completely veſted with a full character; if, I ſay, this is the ſecret aim, 'tis manifeſt the pious fraud is not ſo cloſely concealed as to eſcape their notice, as is evident from the "American Whig," who ſo often appears in this paper, and whom I ſhall leave to manage his own cauſe.</p>
               <p>But why, my brethren, ſhould others take the alarm, and we ſleep on ſecure? Is our cauſe invulnerable? Or is it impoſſible there ſhould be any evil imagination, and ſecret intrigues car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on againſt us? It ſurely cannot but appear ſurpriſing, that the Biſhop intended for us ſhould be like the "log in the fable, who was made king of the frogs." Or, as the prophet ſays of the idols, "One that can do no good, nor is it in him to do hurt." If this is not meant to delude our neighbours of other religious denominations it muſt be to delude us, and keep us quiet till ſuch a Biſhop be ſent, as would be equally diſpleaſing to us, as to them. What objections could the Diſſenters make
<pb n="347" facs="unknown:011212_0178_0F862F1AE60B0380"/>againſt a prelate clothed with full eccleſiaſtical power to govern the laity in communion with the church of England, as well as her clergy, ſuppoſing his juriſdiction confined to them, and not extended to others? It is plain, they could have none. Is it not therefore deſigned to cajole us into a compliance with ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret deſign artfully concealed from public view? It is well known, that many of thoſe additional powers, conferred on Biſhops at home, by the ſtatutes of the nation, would be as griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to us, as to our diſſenting neighbours; and to which, (were we appriſed of it) we ſhould be as ready to make oppoſition, as they. The payment of tithes, the probate of wills, the licenſe of marriages; but above all, the ſpiritual courts, that diſgrace of our church, and intolerable grievance of the nation; are things to which we can, by no means conſent; and againſt the introduction of which, we ſhould be equally oppoſed, were we but ſenſible any ſuch things were intended. If our ſecret ſchemers can but lull us to ſleep, and amuſe us with the expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of having Biſhops amongſt ourſelves, from whom we may hope for ſignal ſpiritual advantages and thereby prevail with us, to uſe our influence for facilitating their deſigns, in procuring to be ſet over us ſuch, as inſtead of being agreeable to our wiſhes, will prove the very reverſe of what we expected; and inſtead of being a bleſſing, will really prove a curſe: How grievous will be our diſappointment? And ſhall we not ever blame ourſelves for that ſupine negligence, whereby we now ſuffer ourſelves to be wheedled into their pernicious devices?</p>
               <p>Are we to have a Biſhop; let him be a Biſhop. Let him be ſet over us with the full authority which the goſpel gives him. Let him exerciſe that ancient godly diſcipline of the primitive church, the want of which, we are taught in our ſervice, yearly to lament:—But let him not come to plague and harraſs us, with that ſhameful ſubſtitute of a ſpiritual court. I am ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that alterations cannot be made i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But what is there to hinder the eſtabliſhment of Biſhops in this part of the world, after the truly primitive pattern; or what is there to keep out the godly diſcipline of the primitive church amongſt us;—where no modern corrupt ſubſtitutes are introduced to prevent it?

And if, to quiet us, we ſhould be told, that when once we have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the eſtabliſhment of Biſhops in this inoffenſive character propoſed, it will be an eaſy matter to obtain any additions to his office, as occaſion ſhall require:—I muſt ſtill demand what ſecurity can be given us, that the additions ſhall not be the ſame, wherewith the Biſhops at home are now inveſted; which would be as grievous to us, as to any of the non-conformiſts.— If they come at all, it is plain, they may come as inoffenſively both to us, and to them, clothed with the power of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive diſcipline, as without it; which of all things, would be the moſt effectual ſecurity againſt ſpiritual courts, and other griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and juſtly dreaded conſequences. The maimed and muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated creature pleaded for in the Appeal to the Public, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to me, and muſt be to every intelligent friend of our church, ſufficient to alarm us, and put us upon our guard, leſt kind words and fair ſpeeches allure us to expect good, when evil is really intended.</p>

<pb n="350" facs="unknown:011212_0180_0F862F21F98E7F40"/>leaves me a legacy, 'tis therefore <hi>improbable,</hi> that I ſhall ever find means of making additions to my eſtate. 5. <hi>"The ſpirit of the times" tends "rather to abridge than add to the power of the clergy, both in</hi> England and America." 'Tis really pleaſant to ſee <hi>ſuch</hi> an argument advanc'd, when the "ſpirit of the times" evidently is, to create new Biſhops, with their ſubaltern officers, and make <hi>Lords of trade</hi> of the old ones. But however juſt Sq. <hi>T</hi>'s obſervation may be as to the generality of the laity, who but Mr. <hi>W—m H—r S—th</hi>'s patients can conſider it as an argument, that <hi>court favour'd, law dignified</hi> eccleſiaſtics wou'd not attempt unreaſonable uſurpations? Such attempts cou'd not be "cruſhed INSTANTLY" even by the vaſt majority in the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican oppoſition; but, tho' they might be <hi>cruſh'd</hi> in time, the numerous non-contents have been too long us'd to arbitrary mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, to riſk a repetition of ſquabbles, ſo diſagreeable to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo liable to be miſrepreſented, as <hi>ſowing diſcord-ſeed</hi> and <hi>trumpeting ſedition.</hi>

               <p>"Had the <hi>W.</hi> liv'd when the ſociety was incorporated," per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he might (tho' I ſuſpect no "perſon of the leaſt diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment," cou'd) have judg'd eccleſiaſtical uſurpation in America, a <hi>bare</hi> POSSIBILITY; but, tho' it might be merely an <hi>apparent poſſibility</hi> at <hi>that</hi> time, it has by <hi>this</hi> (in ſpite of all ſcribbling to the contrary) grown up into an <hi>evident</hi> PROBABILITY. So that all Sq. <hi>T</hi>'s raillery (par. 12.13.) is flat, dull and inſipid.</p>
               <p>On the whole, the conduct of Dr. <hi>C.</hi> Sq. <hi>T.</hi> and Co. &amp;c. is extremely odd. If <hi>we</hi> are not "convinc'd" by <hi>their</hi> pleas for the neceſſity and <hi>apoſtolicality</hi> of epiſcopacy, they tell us, it is ſufficient that <hi>they</hi> are; but, when we tell them why we are afraid of thoſe <hi>apoſtolical</hi> gentlemen, call'd BISHOPS, they even huff us, and try to cram conviction down our throats, by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatively aſſerting, that our apprehenſions are "totally devoid of any foundation." Or, if they condeſend to produce argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they are, as the reader ſees as flimſy as cobwebs. If they wou'd but act reaſonably (ſince neither party can be convinc'd) they wou'd candidly leave the affair to be determin'd by a majority, as Dr. <hi>C. ſeem'd</hi> to do; but alas! they unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly find this method wou'd ruin all their favourite ſchemes.</p>

               <head>From Mr. GAINE'S GAZETTE, Dec. 26, 1768. A WHIP for the AMERICAN WHIG. By TIMOTHY TICKLE, ESQR. [No. XXXVIII.]</head>
               <head type="sub">
                  <hi>A Continuation of Mr.</hi> SEABURY<hi>'s Letter, (Whip No.</hi> 37.)</head>
               <p>HAVING thus given a juſt and faithful hiſtorical Account of this Affair, I ſhall now make ſome Reflections upon the Letter itſelf. And,</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt, I ſhall take Notice of the Spirit and Temper with which it is written. It appears, both from the Letter itſelf, and from Dr. Chauncey's Letter to Mr. Rogers, that the Deſign of the Letter Writer was to vindicate him (Dr. Chauncey) from an Accuſation of Falſhood; But with what Spirit has the Author done this, or more properly attempted it?—With the moſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>levolent Party Rage, and with ſuch Rancour and Ill-Nature, as none but a Heart inflamed by Malice could dictate. The whole Letter ſhews this to have been the Temper and State of Mind in which it was written, and no Cenſure paſſed upon it can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly expoſe it. Inſtead of vindicating Dr. Chauncey, he rails at Mr. S-b-ry; accuſes him of "giving Dr. Chauncey the Lie," —of making "rude and injurious Reflections on the Dr."—of being a "troubleſome Perſon,"—of a "malevolent Spirit,"— of having "impertinently diſturbed the Quiet of this Country for ſome Time paſt," and ſtrange to tell! of being a "Declaimer againſt Falſhood," and a "Stickler for Impartiality in writing." —If by this Country the Letter Writer means Boſton, and the Territority thereunto belonging, I ſeriouſly declare, That I have been ſo far from "diſturbing the Quiet of that Country," that I never was in it; that I have no Agents in it; that I do not recollect ever to have wrote a ſingle Letter to any Perſon in it: —In ſhort, I have, and deſire to have nothing to do with it.</p>
               <p>If by this Country the Letter-Writer means the American Colonies in general;—I do not remember that I have done any Thing by which the Quiet of any one Perſon could have been diſturbed, except, that I once called the American Whig to an Account, for his Effrontery in ſaying, that Dr. Chandler "and the Convention, do not deſire ſuch a Biſhop as is mentioned in the Appeal:" And if the American Whig will allow me a very ſmall Share of that Vanity with which he himſelf is ſo replete, I can confidently affirm, that in the Affair litigated between us at that Time, I "laid him fairly on his Back without knowing my Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt;"—whether
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:011212_0181_0F862F23850A19A0"/>he hath ſince gotten upon his Legs, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>ad hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>umbit Humi</hi> Bos, is a Matter of more Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to him than to me.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. The Letter ſigned B. W. as far as it relates to me, is "utterly, abſolutely and entirely falſe and groundleſs." And tho' this Writer is ſo very angry with Mr. S-b-r-y, for giving, as he ſays, "Dr. Chauncey the Lie," yet he himſelf has writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten without any Regard to Truth. I ſpeak only of what relates to myſelf in B. W's Letter,—a lying Heart hath directed a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Hand.—I poſitively declare, that I was ſo far from being the Author of the Paper to which he refers, that I never ſaw it, heard it, thought of it, or dreamed of it, 'til it made its pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Appearance in Mr Gaine's Paper of July 4th — Who B. W. is, I know not, and to ſpeak the Truth, care not But B. W. ſays, he is "a Son of the Church of England,"—"a real Friend to its Growth and Proſperity,"—"a Member of the Society for the Propagation of the Goſpel in foreign Parts,"—a Friend to Decency, good Manners, and a becoming Treatment, eſpecially, of reſpectable Characters,"—"and what is more—a Friend to Truth and honeſt Impartiality."—If Mr. B. W. is endowed with all theſe good Qualifications, it is very ſtrange that not one of them ſhould ſhew itſelf in the Letter now under my Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—Is he a "Son of the Church of England?" Let him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that the Church teaches and requires him "to keep his Tongue from evil Speaking, Lying, and Slandering." Is he "a Friend to the Growth and Proſperity of the Church?" —Why then does he take Part with its avowed Enemy? Why does he repreſent thoſe who contend only for its real and juſt Rights and Privileges, as troubleſome Perſons, of a malevolent Spirit, who have impertinently diſturbed the Quiet of their Country for ſome Time paſt? Is he a "Member of the Society for the Propagation of the Goſpel?" That venerable Body have ever cheriſhed, countenanced, and protected thoſe Miſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that did their Duty; they never abuſed, ſlander'd, or vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied them, in anonymous Letters and ſcurrilous Papers.—Is he "a Friend to Decency and good Manners, and a becoming Treatment, eſpecially of reſpectable Characters?" Why then has he treated me with ſo much Indecency and Ill-Manners? If a ſteady and ſincere Deſire and Endeavour to do my Duty in that honourable State of Life to which it hath pleaſed God to call me, will entitle me to any Reſpect. I may, without Vanity affirm, that my Character is reſpectable enough to have entitled me to a more becoming Treatment. Is he "a Friend to Truth and honeſt Impartiality?" How could ſuch a Perſon, write
<pb n="353" facs="unknown:011212_0181_0F862F23850A19A0"/>ſuch a Letter?—A Letter from which, if you take all that is falſe and partial, you will leave a mere Chart Blanch.</p>
               <p>Mr. B. W. ſays I "gave Dr. Chauncey the Lie." It is a Form of Speech in which I do not allow myſelf to my menial Servants: And with Regard to any Thing Dr. Chauncey hath ſaid in his Anſwer to Dr. Chandler's Appeal, I am ſo far from giving him the Lie, that I deliberately declare I never read more than a Dozen Pages in it, and never intend to read a Dozen more.—When an Author can calmly and ſeriouſly ſet himſelf to eſtabliſh ſuch wild Poſitions as that "the Church of England does not teach the Divine Right of Epiſcopacy, and that her Reformers did not believe it," I can ſpend my Time much more profitably than in giving him the Reading. Perhaps it may be alledged in Excuſe for the Dr. that he wrote his Pamphlet in leſs than two Months; that he is an old Man, and thefore it muſt be expected he will be tedious and poſitive: Tediouſneſs and Poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs being often the Foibles of old Age. This I confeſs would be a good Excuſe for not writing at all; and it is much to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that the Dr. does not avail himſelf of it, and of the Poet's Advice,

               <p>That the Dr. is in ſome Danger of meeting with this Accident, every one muſt be ſenſible, who conſiders with what Rapidity he anſwered Dr. Chandler, if any Credit is due to the American Whig. And now behold he hath advertiſed a Volume of Thirty Sheets at leaſt, in which the Fathers of the Church are, many Centuries after their Martyrdom, again to be put to the Rack, and tortured into Confeſſions. If however the Dr. ſhould eſcape this Fate, the following Line of another Poet, will be very ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to ſo voluminous a Writer.—"See who ne'er was nor will be half-read."—This, as I put no Motto to this Paper, many ſerve inſtead of one to thoſe who are found of Motto's; and I hope it will not be thought the worſe for being introduced in the Body of my Performance.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. I ſhall take Notice of the villainous Baſeneſs of this Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in putting B. W. at the End of his Letter. Poſſibly he thought he had a Right to preſs any two Letters in the Alpha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet into his Service. But certainly it is a moſt extraordinary Piece of Conduct, firſt to declare himſelf a Member of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and then to affix the initial Letters of another Member's
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:011212_0182_0F862F2425808278"/>Name to his ſcandalous Production; eſpecially when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that B. W. are the initial Letters of no other Name on the Society's Liſt of Members, but only of Benning Wentworth, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and that this B. W's Letter, tho' now it has all the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a baſe-born Child, brought forth in Secrecy, was uſhered into the World, by James Parker, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who acted the Part of Man-Midwife at its Birth, as the legitimate Offspring of a reputable Parent, who was ready to own, ſupport, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it. Whether the Writer intended by this artful Conduct, to lead People into a Belief that the Letter was really written by a Gentleman of ſo eſtabliſhed a Reputation as Mr. Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth is, in order to give a greater Weight to his Aſſertions; or whether it was with a Deſign to terrify Mr. S-b-r-y from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to his infamous Performance, is not eaſy to determine: Poſſibly both theſe Motives may have concurred, to induce him to proceed in this daſtardly, fradulent Manner. The firſt of theſe Inventions was fully anſwered in this Place, by the ſigning B. W. to the Letter, and by "Mr. Parker's poſitive Aſſertion, That Mr. Wentworth was the Author of it." That the other Deſign did not ſucceed, the Author is by this Time, I believe, pretty well convinced.</p>
               <p>The Author has declared himſelf a Member of the Society for the Propagation of the Goſpel; and Dr. Chauncey ſays (if I remember right) in his Letter to Mr. Rogers, "that he is an Inhabitant of the Town of Boſton." I have carefully examined the Liſt of the Society's Members for the Year 1767, I can find only four Members who reſide in Boſton, viz. His Excellency Francis Bernard, James Apthorp, Hugh Hall, and John Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Eſqrs. To all theſe Gentlemen I am perſonally unknown. I am utterly at a Loſs to conceive, that I have ever given any Occaſion to them to treat me in ſo injurious and cruel a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as I find mſelf treated in that Letter. I cannot therefore ſuppoſe, that any one of theſe Gentlemen was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it. It remains then with Dr. Chauncey to produce his Author, or to take the Letter, with all its "Fraud, Forgery, Villainy, Scandal, Falſhood, and Baſeneſs," upon himſelf.</p>
               <p>To you therefore, moſt venerable Doctor, I now beg Leave to addreſs myſelf. Poſſibly you may think I treat you with too great Freedom; that your Age, Station, and Character ſhould exempt you from it. Age is not an Excuſe for ſuch baſe Conduct as you have been guilty of, and therefore it ought not to ſcreen you from the Conſequences of it. My Station and Character, (ſave the Article of Learning) are equal to yours; and if you think that ſome Regard is due to the Station and Character, you ought to have conſidered, before your illiberal Attack upon me.—You
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:011212_0182_0F862F2425808278"/>have been at the Pains of ſending an anonymous Letter 250 Miles, directing it to be printed in a public News-Paper, that it might circulate far and wide, in order to wound the Character of a Man, utterly unknown to you, who never did, nor intended to do you any injury;—and who was even innocent of the heinous Crime of having contradicted you. When you coolly and calmly conſider this Part of your Conduct, I cannot but hope you will feel ſome little Compunction of Heart; ſome, if they be ſlight, Rebukes of Conſcience; ſome Tendency at leaſt towards a Bluſh. What Reparation you will think proper to make me, I know not; but that ſome Reparation ought to be made, you muſt be ſenſible. The Bread of myſelf and Family; nay more, my Uſefulneſs as a Miniſter of Chriſt, depend upon that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, which you have cruelly ſported with, and moſt unjuſtly endeavoured to deprive me of.—Theſe Things, Sir, I ſay, not for my own Sake, but for yours; to make you ſenſible of the Iniquity of your Conduct; and to bring you, if poſſible, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Amendment. For my own Part, tho' it would but ill become me to boaſt, yet I truſt, that within the narrow Circle of my Acqu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If therefore you chooſe to perſiſt in the Way of Defamation, and had rather endeavour to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate what you have done, than like an honeſt Man, and a good Chriſtian, to repent and retract it, you have my free Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to act as is moſt natural and agreeable to your Inclinations.</p>

                  <salute>Dearly beloved brethren,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>GREAT are the advantages of a new interpretation of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. By this we are relieved from many burdens and yokes of bondage, to which former interpreters have unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſubjected us. 1ſt. We ſhall be delivered from the irkſome duty of believing in the ſun of righteouſneſs for juſtification, which has always been inſiſted upon by the old interpreters of of this text; who, by the ſun here, fooliſhly underſtood Jeſus Chriſt and his merits, by faith in whom true Chriſtians were to be juſtified. This they ſpoke of as the great glory dignity and honour of believers:—And therefore have urged mankind with truly nonſenſical zeal to believe in Chriſt, and to look to him for becoming to them in a ſpiritual ſenſe, what the ſun in the firmament was in a natural ſenſe.—2dly, We ſhall be delivered from the inſupportable burden of regulating our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſentiments, according to the doctrine taught in the New-Teſtament by the twelve Apoſtles. By the crown of twelve ſtars in our text, has generally been underſtood, by dreaming commentators, conformity in articles of faith to the doctrine of the Apoſtles.—And hence much learned pains have been taken in comparing ſcripture with ſcripture, to fix and determine the leading principles of Chriſtianity: But now, this drudgery of believing orthodoxly, which has done much miſchief in the world, we are happily freed from, by a modern paraphraſt, who demonſtrates, that all the antient commentators have been miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:011212_0183_0F862F24EA46BD18"/>in underſtanding by the twelve ſtars, the apoſtolic doctrines of Chriſtianity.—3dly, Another great advantage, accruing to Chriſtians, by the new mode of interpretation is, that they will be happily reſcued from the mortifying buſineſs of ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial. There will be no need of ſpiritual mindedneſs, croſſing our carnal inclinations, or ſtriving againſt terrene affections. You know, my brethren, that this has been the interpretation, generally gone into by our old divines, of "the moon under her feet." But now it appears, they were only a pack of "hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed writers, and pragmatical enthuſiaſts, who expected to find their account in raiſing a combuſtion and being noiſy." Thus you ſee that renouncing the old interpretation of ſcripture, will introduce you into a glorious liberty. The antient inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters and teachers were always for ſhackling us with the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of juſtification by faith in the merits of Chriſt, with the neceſſity of a good degree of apoſtolic orthodoxy in our ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and what was worſt of all, with the indiſpenſible obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of an holy walk and converſation; but the new inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation ſets us free from all this more than Egyptian bondage. —Now to ſhew further wherein the antients were miſtaken, and to ſot the advantages of the new interpretation in a true light: This woman, clothed with the ſun, having a crown of twelve ſtar on her head, and the moon under her feet, is The Church dreſſed and dignified with the glorious trappings, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages, perquiſites and advantages, which ariſe from her bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed "alliance with the ſtate in Chriſtian countries." Theſe ornaments are in our text mentioned under three heads, "which may be reduced to civil power, temporal poſſeſſions, and legal exemptions."—Civil power is the clothing of the ſun. You know what a brilliant ſigure the church always makes, when ſhe has regal dignity at her head, is incircled with gartered peers, and led into green paſtures by mitred lords.—Temporal poſſeſſions is her crown of twelve ſtars. Theſe are the tenth part of the lands of the ſtate, which were ſolemnly offered in holy unburnt ſacrifice by "St. Ethelwulph, for the health of his ſoul on the altar of Wincheſter" temple, An. 854; to which is added a tenth part of all the labour and induſtry of the King's ſubjects, who are to manure and cultivate theſe lands for the church, together with a multitude of other perquiſites ariſing from matters teſtamentary and matrimonial. This is a glorious crown, well ſet with gems, which cauſes the church to ſhine with orient luſtre!—Legal exemption, is another important part of her dreſs. The church enjoys the ſun of civil power, and the glorious crown of temporal poſſeſſions, without the griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous incumbrance of duties and taxes for the ſupport of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="358" facs="unknown:011212_0184_0F862F25ACCA9938"/>the poor, or any other charges of ſtate. Thus ſhe has the moon under her feet; has not the mortification of parting with her lands or money either to protect or defend her.</p>
               <p>Again, the new method of interpretation diſcloſes more truth from the text. By the ſun is farther meant the extenſive biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rics and metropolitan ſees of the church. Theſe give light to Chriſtian eyes, and are a lamp to their feet—By the crown of twelve ſtars is intended the hierarchy of the church. 1. Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops, 2. Dioceſans, 3. Prebends, 4. Deans, 5. Suffragans, 6. Chancellors, 7. Vice-Chancellors, 8. Archdeacons, 9. Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, 10. Prebends, 11. Curates, 12. Prelatical Baillies. Theſe are the twelve ſtars that beſpangle her crown of temporal poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions; and an illuſtrious conſtellation they are—None can object here, "unleſs they do it from ignorance or malice," that theſe church-officers are not found in the Bible; for they are clearly found in our text, and any doctrine or office, proved by one text, is every way ſufficiently eſtabliſhed. But we have not only this one text, to ſupport our prelatic church, but we can eaſily preſs more into our ſurvice. And where theſe fail us, we can eaſily adminiſter conviction of our point by the unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble authority of St. Ignatius, and other more modern fathers, and invincibly prove that theſe were the church's crown for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt 1500 years.</p>
               <p>Moreover in our context, in the ſame viſions, there appeared "another wonder a great red dragon, having ſeven heads and ten horns." And this dragon is that horrible monſter, the Engliſh diſſenters, "who have no natural right to any degree of civil or military power. They perſecuted the woman, and ſhe fled into the wilderneſs of North-America. And here ſhe now is in a naked, periſhing, and, "without ſpeedy remedies," in an infallibly dying condition. She has neither ſun, nor moon, nor ſtars; neither "civil power, temporal poſſeſſions, nor legal ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption;" has nothing to guard her, but a parcel of turn-coat Miſſionaries and lazy luxurious prieſts (<hi>paucis exceptis</hi>)—And now you ſee this "renders her outward circumſtances and figure widely different;" yea, the difference is as great as between "being poſſeſſed of a fortune, and without one,—or between having a large pariſh and a ſmall one." But you muſt know that theſe things do not make any eſſential difference in the church. For tho' "theſe have generally varied in different countries and ages,—yet they have not altered its real nature, which is always and eſſentially the ſame under all outward cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances."—Whether ſhe is in Rome or Geneva, Georgia or Holland, England or Scotland, Abyſſinia or America, ſhe is "always and eſſentially the ſame." And as to her "act, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="359" facs="unknown:011212_0184_0F862F25ACCA9938"/>it is performed by the Biſhop of Man, or the Archbiſhop of Canterbury, or in the language to St. Jerom (with whom! per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly agree) whether by the Biſhop of "Rome or Rhegium, it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not."—If any ſhould here remark, that then the church "is eſſentially and always the ſame," whether it be popiſh or epiſcopalian, preſbyterian or congregational, this can only be "the abuſe of ſome petulant tongues, or more petulant pens." —But the woman is now in America, having fled hither, thro' the aid of Dedalian wings, from the face of the ſerpent; yet the ſerpent has perſued her to this wilderneſs alſo, and beſides drawing with his tail many ſtars of Heaven, he covers more than ſeven-eighths of this wilderneſs with his body; yea, he overſpreads all the northern colonies, except a very few ſpots, which would in like manner have been covered by the filthy monſter, had it not been for the unexampled liberality, and truly exceſſive "charity of the worthy ſociecy." To which ſociety "the church owes its exiſtence at this day in ſome of the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies," for it either had been drowned by the flood, or cruſhed beneath the ſerpent's weight, if the ſociety's "indifatigable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and amazing perſeverance" had not prevented; becauſe the earth here doth not help the woman.—Thus you ſee the great diſtreſs and periſhing condition of the church; wherefore, travailing in birth and paining to be delivered, her clergy and friends, "looking up to your grace," and call (with our mouths, for we have no trumpets) over the Atlantic to your Majeſty for help and relief in our deplorable and wretched circumſtances. Some of us have been looking up and calling over, not merely from morning to evening, but theſe 40, 50, or 60 years, and are not heard even to this day. Is the head of the church aſleep? Is he deaf or on a journey? or if we leap on our altars, and cut ourſelves with knives and lancets, will there be no voice nor any to anſwer?—What can be further ſaid? Is it not demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable, that the American church muſt ſoon periſh? She has neither ſun to clothe, her, nor moon to tread upon, nor twinkling ſtars to ſhed a ray thro' her tremendous gloom. She is periſhing! ſhe is periſhing! her diſeaſes muſt prove fatal; and none can wonder ſhould death be the event; for ſhe wants the common neceſſaries of life. She therefore "earneſtly requeſts, and only requeſts" (at preſent) one ſtar to comfort her, even a mutilated ſuffragan, which is far from being a ſtar of the firſt magnitude. Oh! that proper remedies may be provided for her preſent ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings! Oh, that ſhe may be delivered out of her unparrallel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led diſtreſs! Oh! oh! oh!</p>
               <p>Now, my very dearly beloved brethren, I diſmiſs you for the preſent; whether I have ſaid any thing "preſumptuous or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable,
<pb n="360" facs="unknown:011212_0185_0F862F26623B6D80"/>let heaven and earth judge." For all, whether pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants or papiſts, preſbyterians, or epiſtcopalians, <q>if they are in reality the friends of truth and juſtice and liberty—they muſt be heartily diſpoſed to act a friendly part towards us, with regard to an American epiſcopate.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Bleſſed forever be the Biſhop of Landaff, and let every one of us ſay, Amen, Amen.</q>

                  <hi>The Doctor's miracle accounted for, in a natural and eaſy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner by father Paul, a Romiſh writer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>LET us hear what a more celebrated writer than even Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingworth himſelf, ſays on this ſubject.—A writer as much converſant with the antiquities of the church as any man living, and whoſe affinity to the church of Rome, might have blinded him had it been poſſible. I mean father Paul of Venice, the admired hiſtorian of the council of Trent. In his diſcourſe upon exemptions from epiſcopal authority Lib. 2. he takes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſhew how that authority took its riſe, and by what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees it roſe to its height. Out of this, compared with that upon epiſcopal juriſdiction, Lib. 4. we collect the following in ſubſtance, tho' not verbatim, viz.</p>
               <p>That,</p>
               <p>
                  <q>According to St. Paul to the Cor. the whole body of the primitive church, took cognizance of offences, as appears from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>is reproving them, that they 'had not lamented to ſeparate from among them the tranſgreſſor:'—As their cuſtom was to do it with much mourning and faſting. It was neceſſary that the judgment of the multitude ſhould be d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>cted by one, and the Biſhop [or miniſter, according to his office] always preſided and directed the action. But when Chriſtians became numerous, the matter was uſually ripened in the conſiſtory, and by them propoſed to the general congregation for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution. This form was ſtill on foot in the year 250, as is plainly ſeen by the epiſtles of St. Cyprian, concerning thoſe who did eat meats offered to idols.—And St. Jerome teſtifies, that in the beginning of Chriſtianity the churches were guided by an ariſtocracy or common council of the preſbytery.— The goodneſs and charity of the Biſhops, made their opinions for the moſt part to be followed, and by little and little cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity waxing cold, this was the cauſe why the church not regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the charge laid upon them by Chriſt, did leave the care to the Biſhop; 'and ambition a witty paſſion, which doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate itſelf in the ſhew of virtue," did cauſe it to be readily embraced.—Diviſions at length ariſing among themſelves,
<pb n="361" facs="unknown:011212_0185_0F862F26623B6D80"/>they ſell upon the monarchial form of government, giving all the ſuperintendency to the Biſhop, and ridding themſelves of the trouble, until the times of perſecution ceaſing, the Biſhops (or Miniſters) of one province did govern themſelves in ſynods, and to make this government more eaſy, attributing much to the Biſhop of the principal city, they made him head of that body; and by a more ample communication of all the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces in a great government, the Biſhop of the head city where the chief ruler did reſide, got a ſuperiority, as was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, from cuſtom. Thus aroſe the Romiſh Biſhop above all, as Rome was then the capital of the whole world:—Hence alſo the vaſt influence and power of the patriarchs of Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, over Egypt, Lybia and Pentapolis, of Antioch over Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, and the eaſtern provinces, and ſo of the leſſer Eparchai or Prefectures. This government brought in by cuſtom, and ſuppoſed conveniency only—and for ſome time executed with great fidelity, was found by Conſtantine of great benefit to him in civil affairs, as by it he ſaw many cauſes determined with all the authority and ſanction of religion. He therefore made a law that there ſhould lie no appeal from the ſentences of Biſhops, and that the ſecular judge ſhould execute them, This eccleſiaſtical form of government with all its peculiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties was under him eſtabliſhed by the firſt council of Nice, and ordained by a canon to be perpetual. After this the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Biſhops was from time to time enlarged or diminiſhed as affairs happened to turn.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Hence the whole train of dioceſan Biſhops, Archbiſhops, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans, Primates, Patriarchs and Popes.—The Doctor's miracle is thus unravelled in a plain and natural manner, and if antiquity has any certain voice, it confirms it.</p>

               <p>TO every ſenſible reader, after the maſterly reaſoning of the W'<hi>s</hi> 17th, No. Sq. T. in his 32d. muſt appear like a <hi>Whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per</hi> chaſtizing a man with a <hi>ſtraw.</hi> The <hi>W.</hi> had mentioned 5 particulars in which, if in any thing the derivation of "happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſupport" "to the" ſtate from the Church, and the "harmony" of both, muſt be evinc'd; but he afterwards prov'd, that in thoſe articles the Church as at preſent <hi>eſtabliſh'd,</hi> does not <hi>harmonize</hi> with the ſtate, and therefore, as ſuch, can afford it neither "happineſs nor ſupport:" And yet, out of even this defeat, Sq. <hi>T.</hi> wou'd fain <hi>Whip</hi> a victory for D.<hi>C.</hi>—Let us ſee how he manages.</p>
               <p>By his reaſoning (to make him a ſmall compliment) I'm al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt convinc'd, that (as I've heard ſome ſophiſtical diſputants ſay) nothing is ſo abſurd, but that ſomething may be ſaid in it's favour; and yet it's plain, that all he has ſaid under art. 1.2 and 5, relative to the <hi>King's ſupremacy,</hi> inſtead of proving that the Church of <hi>England</hi> "ſupports," on the whole rather proves, what is really true, that ſhe is SUBDUED to, the ſtate. Mighty meritorious this! Henry VIII. the firſt who claim'd eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſupremacy, uſurp'd it, not from a "deſire of uniting the Church to the ſtate," but out of revenge againſt the POPE: And if his parliament, in confirming it to him, aim'd at any thing more than gratifying an ambitious monarch they durſt not offend, they doubtleſs meant to take care, that "the civil magiſtrate" ſhou'd no longer be (as Sq. <hi>T.</hi> expreſſes it) "a mere tool to the church." As to the Church, ſhe did not <hi>"deprive herſelf of her natural independency,"</hi> but ſurrender'd it ſorely againſt her will, becauſe <hi>Harry</hi> was ſo boiſterous, that ſhe durſt not defend it againſt him. Sq. <hi>T.</hi> tells us, "religion is the <hi>main</hi> ſupport of government." This I am not clear in,—the temporal happineſs of mankind being the proper object of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, it ſeems to be <hi>mainly</hi> ſupported by hopes and ſears of a temporal kind. I know indeed that religion is of great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to a ſtate; but not as a <hi>national religion,</hi> ſuch a one being, properly ſpeaking, no religion at all, but a mere <hi>political engine.</hi>
                  <pb n="363" facs="unknown:011212_0186_0F862F27435BA268"/>If ſuch a religion therefore "ſupports" a ſtate, all that can be ſaid is that <hi>the ſtate ſupports itſelf.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>divine</hi> or <hi>ſuppos'd divine</hi> original of a religion, that gives additional ſupport to a ſtate, and, were it not for this, the religion of the <hi>Koran</hi> would have no more moral influence on the civil conduct of a muſſel-man than on that of the A. Bp. of <hi>C-nt-y.</hi> Hence, uninfluenc'd by any hopes of political advantages, the proteſtant (i. e. the <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> or <hi>diſſenters</hi>) of FRANCE, behav'd ſo, that <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV, tho' he afterwards revok'd the edict of <hi>Nanter,</hi> gave an ample teſtimony to their loyalty, in his declaration 1652, and the Queen-mother acknowledg'd <hi>they had ſav'd the ſtate;</hi> and even now, epiſcopalian bigets can commend <hi>French proteſtants,</hi> while they ſpout ſcandal at Engliſh diſſenters. "An <hi>Imperium in Imperio,</hi>" Sq. <hi>T.</hi> ſays, "every wiſe common wealth will avoid, if poſſible."—The <hi>Jews</hi> in our SAVIOUR's time (who, tho' he declar'd his <hi>kingdom was not of this world,</hi> was ſole <hi>head of the Church</hi>) profeſs'd (mighty <hi>loyally,</hi> no doubt!) to act from the ſame <hi>wiſe</hi> principles of policy; and yet CHRIST was a King, in ſpite of <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and wou'd have been ſo even, tho' <hi>Caeſar</hi> had declar'd himſelf <hi>head of, the Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Sq. <hi>T.</hi> pleads, as meritorious, the privileges of the Church, as well as the prerogatives of the King;—juſt like a <hi>Whipper,</hi> who, whether he flogs or is kick'd) boaſts, that all is for the good of the public. For the 1ſt of the Churches privileges (Art. 3d, <hi>viz. Biſhops ſitting in parliament,</hi> he pleads, <hi>"the uſefulneſs, &amp;c. of their advice, &amp;c."</hi> when the legiſlature is plagu'd (as it never ſhou'd be) with "Church affairs." Whether <hi>their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> is likely to ſupport the ſtate or not, when eccleſiaſtical and political intereſts interfere, is eaſy to gueſs; however 'tis as eaſy to ſee that their <q>advice and aſſiſtance might be had without their <hi>enacting judgment.</hi> 2. <hi>That epiſcopal voices make laws more binding.</hi>
                  </q> For my part, I judge of the obligation of the laws, not from the <hi>character,</hi> but, from the <hi>right</hi> of the legiſlator, nor ſhou'd I think our provincial laws a want "more binding," even tho' the whole of our legiſlature were compos'd of BISHOPS: What ſay you, my countrymen <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <head>From Mr. GAINE'S GAZETTE, Jan. 2, 1769. A WHIP for the AMERICAN WHIG. By TIMOTHY TICKLE, ESQR. [No. XXXIX.]</head>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>ALTHO' I have a natural Diſreliſh for Controverſy, and am far from being moved by any perſonal Diſregard to the Author of "the Letter to the Biſhop of Landaff;" yet, as a Friend to the Author of the Vindication, and a "Lover of that Truth and Decency, which I think are juſtly preſerved throughout his Pamphlet, I cannot help intereſting myſelf in the Diſpute. But, notwithſtanding the Subject has thus become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting to me, the Part I ſhall take in it, will be conducted with Coolneſs and Impartiality; it being a Maxim with me, that the Page to which I ſet my Pen, ſhall never be ſtained with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous Blots of Malevolence, or the ſoul Daubings of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentleſs Hand of Party-Zeal.</p>
               <p>On reading, and attentively conſidering, both the Letter and Vindication, free from Prejudice, I was upon the whole, and as yet am ſatisfied, that the latter contains a full and complete Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of the former. And what more ſtrongly enforced this Concluſion upon my Mind, was, that the Arguments of the Vindicator are principally founded on Facts, and his Inferences are ſuch as naturally reſult from them.</p>
               <p>How far the Ingliſiana may tend to induce a Change of Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent in me, I know not; but ſhould there, thro' this Medium, any new Light break from that dark Cloud which now invelopes the Letter, and the favourite Subject eſpouſed by it's Author, I ſhall cheerfully yield to the illuminating Ray. Blinded neither by Prejudice, nor heated with Party-Zeal, I ſhall always be open to Conviction.</p>
               <p>But ſhould the Whig take up Raillery for Reaſon, and ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a Play of Wit in the Room of ſolid Argument; and ſhould his firſt Number of the Ingliſiana, in this Reſpect, be characteriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical of the Reſt, he muſt allow me the Privilege (however inferior I may be to him in Point of Wit) of ſeaſoning my Anſwers to ſuch of his Papers, with a little Spice of the ſame Ingredients. Perhaps my Efforts may be feeble and ſomewhat aukward, for I claim not Wit as my native Inheritance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="366" facs="unknown:011212_0188_0F862F2A90636B58"/>What I mean by this is, that ſhould it ſo happen, that any of my Remarks may be ſomewhat keenly edged, the Author of the Letter will excuſe me, from this plain Principle of Juſtice, namely, that I have a Right to make uſe of ſuch Kind of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons as he himſelf has brought into the Field. My principal Deſign, is however, to adhere cloſely to reaſoning upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, avoiding all perſonal Abuſe and Invective. If I ſometimes range in the airy Region of Fancy, it will be only when my Antagoniſt calls me aſide, and takes Poſt there; and while we are diverting ourſelves upon this Ground, I ſhall not act ſo mean and ignominious a Part, as to throw dirt in his Face, or beſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter him with Calumny. The Support of Truth is the ſingle Object I aim at, and I truſt I ſhall purſue it with the Candour of an ingenuous Mind.</p>
               <p>I am ſenſible, Mr. Tickle, that you have generouſly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to become an Advocate for the Vindicator; and am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded his Cauſe could not have been committed to better Hands. —It is, I confeſs, Preſumption in me to think of aſking you to permit me to take this Engagement upon myſelf. But are you not already engaged in a Work of Importance, that is more general in its Nature, and may not your undertaking to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the Vindication, too much break in upon, and interefere with this more extenſive Deſign?</p>
               <p>Shall I then with your Leave, 'Squire Tickle, ſtep in as a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntier to reſcue the Character and Abilities of a worthy Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, from an Attack, which (to ſay no worſe of it) is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generous? I have the utmoſt Confidence that I can ſhield his Reputation from every Aſſault, and bring off the Vindication triumphant in the End.—They both ſtand upon good Ground, and cannot but be victorious.</p>
               <p>In the Proſecution of my Plan, I propoſe to anſwer the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Ingliſiana regularly, in Mr. Gaine's Gazette. The Title I ſhall adopt, is that of, The Candid Examiner; and as I conceive the Arguments in the Vindication are fair and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and that it may be defended upon the moſt ſolid and rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Principles, it ſhall be my Endeavour to ſhew, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which this Paper breathes, correſponds with the Title under which it appears—If you approve of my Propoſal, you will be pleaſed to ſignify it by the Publication of this Paper. The next I ſhall ſend will be an Anſwer to the firſt Number of the Ingliſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ana; and I would deſire that it might be publiſhed under the Title of, The Candid Examiner, No. I. which I ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue as Occaſion may require.</p>

               <p>THE Controverſy between you and Mr. Whig, after a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of ſo many Months, ſeems to be as f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> from a Concluſion as the warmeſt Advocate for Contention could wiſh; and on the Part of your great Opponent, ſeems rather about Words than Meaſures; more about what may poſſibly, than what is likely to happen; and in a great Meaſure, is an Abuſe of the Time and Attention of that Public to whom Dr. Chand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſo ſeriouſly and ſolemnly appeals.</p>
               <p>Whatever may be the religious Profeſſion of the Writer of this Letter, can be of no Manner of Conſequence to you, or Mr. L—the ſuppoſed Author of the Whig: Suffice it to ſay, that as on the one Hand, Impartiality obliges me to accuſe him of wandering from the Path marked out by the Appeal; ſo, on the other, I cannot conceive there is any Neceſſity for ſo ſteadily pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing him thro' that Thicket in which he ſeems, if not loſt, yet very near benighted. For his obſtinate Perſeverance in a a Road ſo foreign to the real Queſtion of the Debate, no Doubt his own Conſcience frequently condemns him; but, be that as it may, to purſue him through all his ſiniſter Turnings and Windings, would be rather to loſe Sight of the Subject (as he does) than to convince your Readers of the Legality and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the Church's Petitions.</p>
               <p>Allow me now to point out to Mr. Whig, what is not, and then, in a few Words, to ſhew what is the Queſtion before a Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, who will not be ſwayed by pompous Declarations, and round Aſſertions, altogether foreign to the Buſineſs in Hand.</p>
               <p>It is not indeed, Mr. Whig, it is not the Matter, Whether or no Biſhops, like other Men, are fond of good Living, and with the rich Man upon Record, would chooſe to "fare ſumptuouſly every Day;"—it is not whether the Epiſcopalians are to provide their Lordſhips a Palace, or two, that will coſt three or £.400.000, or whether they are to dwell in Fiſhermen's Cottages, as once did their Predeceſſors;—it is not whether their Sleeves are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally made of Homeſpun, Lawn, or Crocus;—it is not whether they wear ſquare or round, Caſtor or Beaver Hats;—it is not what Perſecutors Biſhops may have been, when Superſtition and Bigottry over-ſpread the Chriſtian World;—it is not whether they will go to Meeting-Houſes and Conventicles, and chant Hymns through their Noſes; or whether with

On the other Hand, it is not whether Preſbyterians are Bigots, or the Practiſers of an univerſal Charity;—whether they are in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral a Set of hard featured Mortals, who cannot even ſmile on the Proſperity of a Neighbour and Fellow-Chriſtian;—it is not whether it was not for Eaſe of their tender. Conſciences, that they once perſecuted the poor Quakers in New-England, or that they burnt the unhappy People accuſed of Sorcery and Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſt,—It is not whether (pious Souls!) they will keep holy the 30th of January; a Day ſacred to a Man of Humanity; or whether they then feaſt upon Calves Head, and jovially drink to the Memory of the other Man of that Day, thoſe Names will be branded with Infamy while the Sun endures, even honeſt Oliver, who with his Deſcendants and Adherents, are the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed Enemies of Monarchy and true Religion.</p>
               <p>It is not whether the Church has an Eſtate in this City, that has hitherto ſupported her againſt Independent Artillery, and the Title to which is too clear, even for the Aſſaults of a Whig; it is not whether ſome People loſt their Hopes of placing a Party Somebody, in a certain Honourable Houſe; it is not whether a memorable Application for a Charter ſucceeded or miſcarried, and whether a certain Biſhop ſpoke againſt it with his uſual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing Eloquence, at the Board of Trade. No, Friend Tickle, it is not, but really, and truly, and <hi>bona fide,</hi> without Equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or mental Reſervation, it is; whether or not, The Church of England in America has not as good a Right to enjoy all her Privileges and Immunities as any Church on Earth; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided always (and ſoon be it enacted) that the Privileges and Immunities do not interfere with the religious and civil Rights and Liberties of others—here the Matter comes to a Point at once—Debate it with that Calmneſs and Moderation, which ought ever to diſtinguiſh Men who write for the Information of the Public; and wou'd Mr. Whig do this, of how much more Conſequence wou'd his weekly Labours be, than to ſkip and jump about from Poſt to Pillar in the Manner he does, as if really he had no other Intention than to recommend himſelf to his Readers, as a Hero every Way qualified to conſtitute the Character of Mr. Punch in a Show?—believe me Mr. Whig, they may ſmile at your Witticiſms, and admire your wonderful Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for Satire, but they do not ſtand before you convinced by your Scurrility and wonderful Aſſertions, nor are they ſo much fright<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Suppoſe the Britiſh Parliament ſhould paſs an Act to prevent Preſbyterians in America, ever holding a Synod in future, and that no one of your Candidates for the Miniſtry could be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, without going to dear ſweet Edinburgh for his Letters of Ordination, and that the different Legiſlatures upon the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, ſhould paſs Laws to confirm and make it valid and binding upon all their Conſtituents—Pray now for a few Queſtions— Do you really, Mr. Whig, imagine this would be no Hardſhip? —Would you not be the firſt Man to complain of the Cruelty of the Caſe?—At leaſt if you regard any Conſiſtency in your Character, Would your Church (you love to be churched dearly of late) do you imagine, flouriſh under ſuch Reſtrictions as much as you or any other Member of it have a Right to wiſh for? Would you not think it hard to go a Voyage of 3000 miles on an Errand, the Buſineſs of which could as well be anſwered (with Leave) at Home? Has many of your young Band, think you, £. 100, a £. 150 to ſpare, to provide for the neceſſary Expences of ſuch a Voyage? If Half or a Third of them were drowned in proſecuting the Voyage, would you not think the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſome Meaſure acceſſary thereto, and as a Lawyer, be very apt alſo to adviſe a Proſecution againſt that auguſt Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, for wilful Murder, as they at leaſt by inference conſtrained the ſpruce young Gentlemen of Yale to the Danger? Such Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons being drowned, would you not think the Family (perchance thereby made deſtitute of Support) moſt cruelly and deſpitefully neglected, did not Churchmen contribute to their Maintenance? I addreſs you for Anſwer not as a Whig or Tory, not as Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian or Churchman. As a Man,—as a Chriſtian, are theſe Queſtions applicable or not?—Oh! lay your Hand upon your Heart, and declare like an honeſt Man, before God and the World, and as you ſhall one Day anſwer it,—do you in your Soul think, the Church has a Right to a Biſhop in America, upon Dr. Chandler's declared Plan, or not? I cou'd venture my Life, wou'd you be candid and ſincere, and for once diveſt your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of Prejudice, that the Moment of your reading this, your Conſcience anſwers in the Affirmative. If the Church is in Errors, you nor no other Preſbyterian will have them to anſwer for,—to the Church and its Members be it,—they have Souls as well as Diſſenters, and pray, Mr. Whig, let them be ſaved or d—in their own Way.

               <p>WHETHER Dr. Chandler means to ſupport the proofs he adduces in ſavour of an epiſcopacy in general, or only thoſe for an American epiſcopate in particular. I am at a loſs to determine. If only the latter—his challenge is too general; and a proper explanation had been kind to himſelf as well as to his opponents: To himſelf, as it would have ſaved him the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of entering into a diſpute to which he cannot expect to give a better iſſue than has heretofore been given; to them as it would have ſpared the repetition of old anſwers to worn-out ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments—Was it neceſſary he ſhould firſt confirm the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians in the belief, that the office of a prelate in his ſenſe, was of divine original? Do they need his confirmation? Or is it not evident that he has ſome other end in view? Under the nation of a mere preamble, which did not enter into the eſſence o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> his plan, but ſerved only as an introduction, he artfully aims a ſtroke, at all other denominations of Chriſtians in America; and on pretence of only favouring an American Epiſcopate, he deſigns to make proſelytes to the church of England.

               <p>Whether he intended it or not, his manner of writing has engag'd him in the diſpute between the church of England and other Churches; and his public defiance not having made this an exception, he had need to arms.</p>

                  <pb n="371" facs="unknown:011212_0190_0F862F2CBB8CFEC0"/>His firſt ſection is call'd "A ſketch of the arguments in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Epiſcopacy." And indeed he has given us in a ſmall compaſs, all the arguments of any weight that the church of England has ever produced; or can produce, for her unhappily defering in diſcipline from all the other proteſtant churches un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Heaven. But his title page is too general for his purpoſe, and ſo is his plan of Arguments. Why does he follow the old track, and give us a defence of Epiſcopacy, when in no wiſe requiſite? Why did he not rather attempt to ſupport it, as eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in England, and deſired by him in America, than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to defend it in general? But it has ever been the art of the writers of the church of England in this controverſy, to avoid the plain definition of Epiſcopacy in their ſenſe, as diſtinguiſhed from what the other reformed churches mean by it. This gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen has imitated them. His whole ſucceſs depends upon keeping this diſtinction out of ſight. Let it be but fairly made, and it will be found, that his ſketch of arguments, wherever they are tolerably true, concludes as ſtrongly in favour of his oppoſers, as of himſelf.

Do they deny the ſuperiority of a Biſhop to a mere preſbyter or elder? No,—they give inſtances of it almoſt univerſally. Do they refuſe to acknowledge three degrees of office in the church? No.—there is ſcarce a pariſh without its Biſhop.—its elders, and its deacons. Now to argue againſt thoſe churches by the proof of theſe things in general terms! What is it but an unfair me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of reaſoning, to deceive the unwary?

They find nothing in holy writ to warrant ſuch an enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous hierarchy, which only wants a Pope to complete it, "from the dirt to the ſkies." Nor do they dread all the <hi>ipſo facto</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications thundred out by the canons of that church, againſt all who cannot ſhape their judgment and conſciences to ſuch an unſcriptural prodigy.</p>
               <p>This writer would have done well not to have ſpent his ſketch in proving, that <q>Biſhops are an order in the church ſuperior to Preſbyters merely ſo,—that they have the powers of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and ordination.</q> The man who wages war with no-body, let him fight ever ſo valiantly, cannot be called an hero. Let him not take it amiſs, if I ſhould preſcribe him a taſk not ſo eaſy, but more to his purpoſe, i.e. after he has honeſtly diſtinguiſhed between a dioceſan and a parochial Biſhop,—to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, that the former is more agreeable to the word of God, than the latter; or (if he pleaſes) more agreeable to his venerable St. Ignatius, whoſe ſacred authenticity he is willing to defend, by comparing one of equal degree, and ſuperior li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary merit to himſelf, with the hypocondriacal Hardouin, and whoſe arguments againſt this apoſtolical Saint, are beyond the ability of this or any other writer to anſwer: except by ridicule, which himſelf allows is not a teſt. I ſay, let him prove by St. Ignatius, that a dioceſan is more conſiſtent with the plan of the goſpel, than a parochial Biſhop. His Saint will tell him, that <q>It is a Biſhop's duty "to know the ſtate of his flock" ſo mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely, as to become acquainted (not merely with the heads of families) but with the ſervant maids and others of the houſe.</q> I wou'd therefore demand, whether thoſe epiſtles even allowed to be genuine, the Doctor can ſhew, that their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor had any idea of ſuch a dioceſs, as that of the Biſhop of London, or as all America would make? Or whether he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, that a Biſhop ought to be endowed with omnipreſence, an attribute of deity?

Nay, I could wiſh he had gone farther, and attempted to prove, what never has yet been proved to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction,—that for ſuch "a truly ſcripture Biſhop," we muſt be dependant upon our mother country, as we are for other tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able commodities,—that we muſt have a bill diſputed in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, creating him one, or at leaſt giving him juriſdiction over us, without our conſent:—that the King of England, as "head of the church," has a right to chooſe for us; as if we were not of age, nor competent to chooſe for ourſelves. I do not mean to aſk him to ſhew me that theſe things are <q>originally and eſſentially belonging to the office;</q> he has put us in mind that we ſhould be careful <q>to ſeparate the ſeveral things that have been added as appendages,</q> &amp;c. But to ſhew that it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for us to have one Biſhop with all this enormous load of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages, this unweildly maſs of lumber, than to have a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand as good upon the ſimple plan of the goſpel, and <q>who call no man maſter;</q> to have one, for whoſe creation all England, Scotland, and Wales muſt vote, before we can have him, and in whoſe election and creation, we cannot have the common privilege of Engliſhmen, of Chriſtians, or of men; but muſt ſubmit to thoſe who have nothing to do with us in this matter.—Let the Doctor ſhew, that this is more ſcriptural and eligible, than to have many who can ſhew as much authority from Chriſt, as his Lordſhip, when he comes, tho' they are ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of thoſe anti-chriſtian appendages, and choſen by ourſelves. I boaſt myſelf a non-epiſcopalian, for the ſame reaſon that I boaſt myſelf an Engliſhman; nor can I ſee half ſo much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why we ſhould ſubmit to tyranny in the church, as in the ſtate.</p>
               <p>Allow us, I ſay, the diſtinction between a dioceſan and paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chial
<pb n="374" facs="unknown:011212_0192_0F862F2E9F579710"/>epiſcopate,—allow us to judge from ſcripture, what a Biſhop means, and we are ready to ſubſcribe to the moſt of the Doctor's "ſketch of arguments." The moſt of it, I ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there are ſome exceptions, to which I am amazed that he can ſubſcribe himſelf.</p>
               <p>That he ſhould, for inſtance, adopt that quotation from the offices, by which the function of a preſbyter and prieſt is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. If one views the Church of England as but had pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified from the corruptions of popery; if one traces the hiſtory of its reformation, and conſiders the many impediments which obſtructed its progreſs, one will not wonder at finding the name and office of a prieſt, as well as an altar retained, when the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred doctrine of tranſubſtantiation, or <q>the ſacrifice of the real body and ſoul of Chriſt,</q> in the euchariſt was diſcarded. But ſure, to one who is acquainted only with his bible, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency of retaining the one and dropping the other, muſt appear very glaring. The office of a prieſt under Chriſt, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to ſcripture, as much as the offering of ſacrifices. Upon the popiſh plan, the office is indiſpenſible; upon that of the church of England, it is abſurd.</p>
               <p>To ſuſpect any material alteration in the plan of church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, during the "firſt, ſecond, or third centuries," is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this writer, an argument of <q>a wrangling and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious diſpoſition.</q> And yet himſelf furniſhes us with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a diſpute called the quarto-deciman controverſy, which proves that within that time, ſuch was the character of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, as to ſuffer them to ſeparate from each other, and tear the church to pieces, upon ſo very a trifle, as the <q>time of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ter;</q> a mere ſuperſtition or inſtitution never commanded by the word of God! This methinks ſhews, in ſpite of what the Doctor had ſaid; that their character was not ſuch as to oppoſe all innovations; ſince they not only conſented to this inſtitution of men, but were ſo attached to it, as to quarrel about the time of it to a furious degree.</p>
               <p>We know, that even in the time of the Apoſtles, many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in doctrine did ariſe, and were oppoſed by them. We know that very ſoon after them, the moſt damnable hereſies did ſpring up and ſpread. No one will deny this, or I would aſſign inſtances. The Apoſtle warns them of "evil men and ſeducers." Now if the character and perſecuted ſtate of the primitive Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, was no ſecurity againſt corruption in doctrines, much leſs in diſcipline and government.</p>
               <p>Simple unaſpiring, unſuſpicious men, as were the primitive Chriſtians, were more expoſed to the deſigns of ambition, in the article of government, than in matters of faith. Will the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellant
<pb n="375" facs="unknown:011212_0192_0F862F2E9F579710"/>diſpute this? The event proves it a fact. To what do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination did many Biſhops ariſe within the ſpace of 400 years! The man of Sin, is to this day a monument of the ſupreme height to which this ambition has mounted. Time was when he aſſumed to himſelf more power, than was ever claimed by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf; and above half the world ſubſcribed to the abomination; the world "went wondering after the beaſt." In the Church of Scotland, or any church ſo well eſtabliſhed, where the powers of church officers and all manner of diſcipline have been ſo thoroughly ſifted, and where the reformation occaſioned ſo many conteſts, it would not be ſurpriſing to find an innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this kind vigorouſly oppoſed. But let the Doctor ſhew us that this caſe is parrallel to that of the primitive Chriſtians, who tho' they might be well informed of doctrines neceſſary to ſalvation yet might not in general have equally underſtood the nature of government; as this was a leſs eſſential point in their view, and at that time not ſo thoroughly weighed. Where a plan is ſettled after long conteſt, the leaſt attempt to innovate gives loud alarm: where there never was a conteſt on this head,—men may ſteal by unſuſpected degrees into dominion, until the multitude find the yoke to faſt wreathed to get it off. So that we need not ſuſpect the zeal of the primitive Chriſtians, and yet allow that there were innovations.</p>
               <p>Our author would have us produce the hiſtory of the time, when all the Chriſtian church did tamely reſign their privileges, and how this was accompliſhed without the moſt violent convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? I aſk him with the ſame reaſon to ſhew me the hiſtory, and to account for the prodigy, how one Biſhop upon his plan, began to uſurp over another—And pray let him tell me, how it happened at laſt, without the moſt dreadful convulſions, that one Biſhop aſſumed the whole power, and became the <q>vicar of the ſon of God?</q> The ſame reaſons which will account for one man's arriving at the ſupremacy of the whole church, will certainly account for one ambitious man's obtaining the power of "lording it over ten of his brethren." In plain words, the ſame reaſons will account for the riſe of dioceſan epiſcopacy, which will account for the riſe of an univerſal biſhoprick or pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. For it is full as eaſy to tell how a man got upon the lower round of the ladder, as how he aſcended to the top. As for hiſtory, it gives us as much light in the one caſe, as it doth in the other. The truth is, that ambitious eccleſiaſticks aſſumed, and the civil authority finding it for its advantage, confirmed the tyranny.</p>
               <p>It is on all hands granted that the mighty diſſention between Biſhops. Metropolitans, Archbiſhops, Primates, Patriarchs and
<pb n="376" facs="unknown:011212_0193_0F862F34F296E998"/>Popes, did not ſpring up in the church in a moment. This grand portent was not the birth of a night; but gradually aroſe and gain'd ſtrength for a long time before it came to its criſis. The Dr. indeed inſiſts that the firſt three centuries were clear of corruption. But the form of government in the church, was nevertheleſs greatly changed before the end of the fourth, or elſe the Church of England, cannot pretend to be in the right ſo much as the Church of Rome. But what reaſon could operate in the fourth, that did not alſo operate in the third century? If an innovation would have alarmed in the ſecond, why ſhould it not in the fifth century? If hiſtorians would have given us the particular account in the third century, why did they not in the fourth? Before the end of the fourth, it is certain, the aſpiring prelates had got almoſt to their <hi>ne plus ultra,</hi> and yet no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular account of it, as a ſudden thing. Therefore, tho' I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the language of Chillingworth, in his boaſted demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and eſpecially the paſſage cited by our author; yet I cannot admire his reaſoning. Let us try, whether it will not eſtabliſh popery as well as dioceſan epiſcopacy; by only putting the ſame argument into the mouth of a Jeſuit.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>When I ſhall ſee therefore all the fables in the metamorphoſis acted, and prove true ſtories; when I ſhall ſee all the ariſtocracies in the world lie down and ſleep, and awake into monarchies; then will I begin to believe, that the epiſcopal government (as it obtains in the Church of England) having continued during the Apoſtle's times, and for three hundred years after it,—ſhould preſently after, againſt the Apoſtle's doctrine, and the will of Chriſt, be whirled about like the ſcene in a maſque, and transformed into papacy. In the mean time, while theſe things remain thus incredible, and in human reaſon impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I hope I ſhall have leave to conclude thus:</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The papal juriſdiction is acknowledged to have been received into the church, not very long after the third century.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But between the end of this third century, and this not very long after, there was not time enough, nor poſſibility of ſo great an alteration.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>And therefore there was no ſuch alteration as is pretended: and therefore the papacy being confeſſed to be ſo ancient and catholick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> muſt be granted alſo to be apoſtolick.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The reaſoning is as good in the one caſe as the other. But if you grant that the papal power aroſe gradually, and in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alarming manner, the ſame anſwer is ſufficient to account for the immoderate riſe of epiſcopal power.</p>

               <p>WHEN I entered the Liſts with the American Whig, I really expected that I was to engage with a potent Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; that I ſhould have Reaſon and Argumentation in every Paragraph: I was alſo much pleaſed with the Proſpect of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the "dry Cruſts of Controverſy" mollified by Strokes of Wit and Humour, at proper Intervals. But, how great has been the Diſappointment, both to myſelf and the Public!—Inſtead of Reaſoning, we have been preſented with Sophiſtry; inſtead of Argumentation, with Miſrepreſentation; inſtead of Wit and Humour, with Scurrility and Buffoonery;—Impudence has been obtruded upon as for "ſound Senſe; Pertneſs," for Sprightlineſs; a quaint canting Style, for manly Eloquence; Pedantry, for Erudition, and Falſhood, for Truth.—I am therefore not at all ſurpriſed, at the Contempt with which his Papers are treated by the Public. Nay, I find that I myſelf am, in Danger of being neglected, for attending ſo cloſely upon his Productions: And the general Opinion ſeems to be, that <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Tickle <q>might employ himſelf better, than in making Remarks upon Papers that Nobody reads.</q> For this Reaſon the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Whig muſt not take it amiſs, if I ſometimes am obliged to take three or four of his Papers into Conſideration, in order to furniſh one tolerable Entertainment to the Public.</p>
               <p>In his XXI Numb the American Whig again enters on the Subject of the Expence of American Biſhops; but in a <q>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſo angry, and with a Temper ſo inflamed by Paſſion,</q> that what he ſays on the Subject, deſerves the leſs Attention. Speaking of Dr. Chandler, he ſays,—<q>Indeed, in no other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſhould I diſcredit his Word:</q>—But before he had got half through his Paper, he is fired with Paſſion, which riſes ſo high, that the atrabilious Humour is put into the moſt <q>

                     </gap>uſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Ferments,</q> and the Doctor is painted as a <q>tergiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatious, hypocritical, arrogant Claimant, for Civil Power, and worldly Riches:</q>—Is deſcribed, <q>as ſmuggling into Port this contraband Commodity,</q> viz. American Biſhops, in
<pb n="380" facs="unknown:011212_0195_0F862F36EA743D88"/>a <q>ſneaking, mealy-mouthed, half-choaked, heſitating, claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, diſclaiming, avowing, bungling Manner.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Again, ſpeaking of the Dr. and the Convention, he ſays,—<q>For beſides the extreme Stupidity of confiding in the Promiſes of this Sort of Gentry, when a darling Project is to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, any longer than they labour under an Incapacity of breaking them, it having been their conſtant Practice to vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late thoſe kind of Engagements, whenever their Deſigns were ſufficiently matured to defy Oppoſition, (as ſhall hereafter be abundantly ſhewn from Hiſtory,) it is evident, from their preſent Conduct, that a primitive Biſhop is as far from their Thoughts, as primitive Chriſtianity.</q>—When a Writer thus gives himſelf up to intemperate Anger, and can ſo utterly diveſt himſelf of all Regard to Truth, Decency, and good Manners, inſtead of meriting an Anſwer, he becomes the juſt Object of Contempt.</p>
               <p>With Regard to the Expence of American Biſhops, I have in my 31ſt Num. inconteſtably proved, that no Tax will be needed; a Fund is already provided, and daily increaſing; a Fund eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the pious Donations and Legacies of ſome of the worthieſt Men that England has produced. This outrageous Clamour which this "teſty, petulant Reviler," hath made, and which he hath wearied himſelf in endeavouring to propagate, is only intended to raiſe an Odium againſt American Biſhops; and if I thought the Whig himſelf believed it, or that there was one Perſon in the Province, "above the Capacity of an Idiot," who paid any, the leaſt Regard to the viſionary Tax-bill, with which the Whig's ſecond Sight has tormented him, (in which he has omitted the Article of Bibles, imagining, poſſibly, that as little Uſe is made of the Bible in the Church, as in a Meeting-Houſe,) I would enter into a particular Examination of it. But till I am convinced of this,—and I muſt have better Proof than either the Whig's Word, or that of his footy Fellow-Scribblers,—I chooſe to leave it, and the Remainder of this Paper, to be a Monument (as long as it laſts) of his implacable Oppoſition to the eſtabliſhed Church of the Nation, and the venerable Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God's true Religion. I ſhall juſt take the Liberty to aſk the Whig, Whether, The Rev. Mr. Williams, who had been Rector of Yale-College, was not promoted to the Command of a Regiment, in the Expedition againſt Cape-Breton, in the Year 1745; if that was the Caſe, he might have mentioned it as another Inſtance, beſides Rector Sharp, of an Eccleſiaſtic having a military Promotion.</p>
               <p>The Whig labours hard, in his XXII Numb. to eſtabliſh a Point of the greateſt Importance to himſelf, and the Cauſe he
<pb n="381" facs="unknown:011212_0195_0F862F36EA743D88"/>has undertaken to manage, viz. That Dr. Chandler, Mr. Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, and the Convention, do not deſire, and are not endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to obtain ſuch a Biſhop as is propoſed in the Appeal, or in other Words, a primitive Biſhop, but a <q>modern, proud, Law-dignified, Court-favoured Prelate.</q> It is remarkable that the Whig has indulged himſelf, thro' the whole Courſe of his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, in a moſt flagrant Piece of Sophiſtry.—Dr. Chandler and Mr. Seabury have declared, that they themſelves, and the Convention, have applied for, and deſire only a primitive Biſhop, i. e. a Biſhop whoſe Powers ſhall be of a ſpiritual Kind, ſuch as are derived from the Church and not from the State. It is ſufficiently known, that according to the Principles of the Church of England, and the whole Tenor of Scripture, Biſhops are an Order ſuperior to Preſbyters; and ſuch an Order ſuperior to Preſbyters, it is, that the Clergy of this Country have applied for;—an Order, who are to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain and govern the Preſbyters of a certain diſtrict, and to confirm ſuch of the Laity as deſire to be confirmed. The Whig hath repeatedly declared, that there are no Objections againſt Primitive Biſhops being ſettled in America; but then he conſiders every Preſbyter as a primitive Biſhop; and an Order of Men in the Church, ſuperior to Preſbyters, he conſiders as an Innovation. Under Cover of this Sophiſtry he hath repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly declared, that it is impoſſible we ſhould have a primitive Biſhop; becauſe he would refuſe to give that Apellation to any Perſon, who was of an Order ſuperior to Preſbyters:—From the ſame Source his moſt amazing Kindneſs and Indulgence to the Epiſcopalians has proceeded:—"The Epiſcopalians," ſays he in his Number,—<q>may have I doubt not, a thouſand primitive Biſhops, without Moleſtation. They may make every Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary a Biſhop, without giving any ſort of Uneaſineſs to the Colonies, provided they adhere to the primitive Pattern;</q> i. e. provided thoſe Biſhops are not ſuperior to Preſbyters. The American Whig hath therefore, groſsly impoſed upon his credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Readers, by this Sophiſm. He hath dreſſed up a Phantom, and has moſt unmercifully belaboured it. Whereas he ought to have ſhewed the Inconvenience that would have accrued to the Colonies from the ſettling one or more Biſhops in them, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain, and govern the Clergy of the American Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and confirm ſuch as deſired to be confirmed. Had he done this, or had he endeavoured to have done this, he would have ſtuck to the Point and the Controverſy would before this Time have been at an End. However,</p>
               <p>As he hath attempted to <q>point out ſundry material Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, between the primitive Biſhop, and the Biſhop mentioned by Dr. Chandler,</q> and I will do him the Honour to attend him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="382" facs="unknown:011212_0196_0F862F37A00BA0E8"/>"1ſt, The primitive Biſhop" ſays the American Whig, was "choſen by the People, over whom he was to preſide," and for the Truth of this Aſſertion, he appeals to the Writings of the Fathers, and the Canons of the primitive Church.—And further on, he aſks, "Is it not a Privilege for the People to chooſe their own Biſhops? Why then did Chriſt, the great "King and Head of the Church, confer it upon them"?</p>
               <p>If the American Whig will conſent, that this Point ſhall be decided by Teſtimonies from the Fathers, I will readily join Iſſue with him; with this Proviſo, that his Quotations ſhall be taken immediately from the Writings of the Fathers, and from the Canons of the primitive Churches, and in the original Language. I will not be ſatisfied with Quotations of Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or Tranſlations of Tranſlations; particularly I ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to any Tranſlations, Quotations, or Authorities from St. Peter King's Enquiry; many of which are ſo very faulty, that a School Boy would have deſerved a Flogging for them.</p>
               <p>For the preſent, I abſolutely deny that the primitive Biſhops were choſen by the People; or that Chriſt ever conferred this Privilege upon the People. St. Paul, appointed Timothy Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>op of Epheſus, and Titus of Crete, without any <q>popular Suffrage.</q> When the American Whig produces his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities for theſe Aſſertions, it will then be Time enough to be more particular.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, The American Whig aſſerts, <q>There was one or more primitive Biſhop or Biſhops, in every City or Town, where Chriſtianity was profeſſed.</q>—Anſ. There was one Biſhop in the larger Cities, and in ſome Diſtricts of the Country; and if, thro' Age or Infirmity, he was unable to diſcharge the Duties of his Function, an Aſſiſtant or ſuffragan Biſhop was allowed.—"The Apoſtle Paul," continues the Whig, <q>appointed that there ſhould be Elders or Biſhops ordained in every City, or Town, of the Iſland of Crete.</q>—Anſ. St. Paul conſecrated Titus Biſhop of Crete, and directed him to ordain Elders, i. e. Preſbyters in every City. But if Elders or Preſbyters, and Biſhops, are the ſame, what Need was there of leaving Titus in Crete, to do that which every Elder or Preſbyter might do as well as he? This is an Inſtance of the Whig's Sophiſtry, which I took Notice of above. He uſes the Words. Elder. i. e. Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, and Biſhop, as meaning the ſame Office; which every Perſon who is not as purblind as a Whig, muſt ſee is the Point he ought to have proved, and therefore he has no Right to take it for granted.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, <q>According to primitive Inſtitution, Biſhops were to be apt to teach,</q> i. e. I ſuppoſe diſpoſed to teach,—<q>and
<pb n="383" facs="unknown:011212_0196_0F862F37A00BA0E8"/>to take heed to all the Flock.</q>—he ſhould have added—over which the Holy Ghoſt had made them Overſeers,—i. e. to take the beſt Care they could of the whole Diſtrict, whether greater or leſs, that was committed to their Charge,—<q>To feed the Church of God. But Dr. Chandler's Biſhop is not to be a conſtant Preacher, nor, as far as I can learn from him, to preach the Goſpel at all.</q> But is it not univerſally known and allowed, that one Part of the Biſhop's Office, is to preach the Goſpel? Did Dr. Chandler exclude the Biſhop he mentions, from preaching the Goſpel? Why then this malicious Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt Dr. Chandler? Does not the Governor take Care of the People committed to his Charge, who requires, and ſees that the Judges, Juſtices, and every inferior Order of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates do their Duty: unleſs he in his own Perſon executes the Office of Judge, Juſtice, Sheriff, Conſtable, and Hangman, in every City, Town, and Village in his Government? And does not that Biſhop "take heed to the whole Flock," who requires and ſees that both Orders of Miniſters under him, do their Duty, and adminiſter the Ordinances of Religion, in the various Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations to which they are appointed? Titus was left by St. Paul in Crete, to ordain Elders, Preſbyters, or Miniſters, in every City, and to ſee that they did their Duty: but St. Paul gave no ſuch abſurd Direction, as that he ſhould preach conſtantly in every City.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly, <q>The primitive Biſhop was to diſcipline all Offenders; ſuch as ſinned before all, they were to rebuke before all, that others alſo might fear; and to reject Heretics after the firſt and ſecond Admonition.</q>—But according to his <q>(Dr. Chandler's) Account of his American Biſhop, he is not to diſcipline the Laity at all;</q> &amp;c. To obviate this Objection, I ſhall here give a ſhort, but full Anſwer to the 23d Numb. of the American Whig, which is profeſſedly upon this very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and contains more Miſrepreſentations, than any Paper of the ſame Length that ever appeared in this Province.</p>
               <p>That Excommunication was one Part of the Diſcipline of the primitive Church, I believe will not be denied; and the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Whig, after complaining bitterly of the ſevere Effects of Excommunication in the Church of England, endeavours to prove, that the Church of England has no Diſcipline at all, and quotes Part of the Exhortation in the Office of Commina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Dr. Whitby, and Bp. Burnet, in Support of his Poſition. But if Excommunication be a more ſevere Diſcipline in the Church of England, than it was in the primitive Church, where is the Senſe of aſſerting, that the Church of England has no Diſcipline at all? I am ready to defend Dr. Chandler's Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="384" facs="unknown:011212_0197_0F862F386ADE4DE0"/>viz. <q>That the Power of the Church is entirely Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</q> &amp;c. But if any civil State ſhall determine, that a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon excommunicated by the Church, ſhall not be, <q>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>llowed to commence any Action at Law; nor to be a Witneſs, Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, or Juror, &amp;c.</q> the Church is no more accountable for theſe Conſequences, than for the Effects of any other penal Laws paſſed by the State. None of theſe Conſequences, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, can happen in this Country, becauſe there is no Law to give Being to them.</p>
               <p>With Regard to the ſacramental Teſt, tho' I am no Lawyer, I am confident no Action at Law would lie againſt a Miniſter for r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ſing the Communion to any Officer of a ſcandalous Life, and Converſation; and my Reaſon is, that the Rubrics in the Book of Common Prayer, being eſtabliſhed by Act of Parliament, have the Force of a Law; and it cannot be ſuppoſed that a Miniſter would be puniſhed by one Law for obeying another.</p>
               <p>That the Diſcipline of the Church of England is very much weakened, I readily allow; and I think Dr. Chandler has aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the true Reaſon, viz. <q>Altars are ſet up againſt Altars, and Churches againſt Churches; and thoſe who are rejected by one, may be received by another.</q> The Engliſh Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and Preſbyterians muſt take all the Glory and Honour of this to themſelves. They rent and divided the Church; they ſowed the Seeds of Enthuſiaſm, and Hypocriſy, Libertiniſm, and Infidelity, which have produced a moſt plentiful Harveſt: They refuſe to ſubmit to the Diſcipline of the Church, and then cenſure the Church, becauſe its Diſcipline is not of Force enough to reclaim thoſe that are incorrigible; they, by their Clamours and Cabals, by their reſtleſs Ambition, and unwearied Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to change the "monarchial Government" of their Country, into a Republic; by <q>Reflectors, Watch-Towers, American Whig's, and Centinels;</q> by a <q>premeditated Oppoſition, and pre-concerted Combination</q> from Boſton to Philadelphia; by "Aſſ-ſociations, Conſociations, Preſbyteries and Synods" by Pulpit Harrangues, and private Converſations; have given, and do give, all the Obſtruction in their Power to the Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of American Biſhops, and then have the Effrontery to make their Non-appointment an Argument to prove, that the Office of Biſhop in the Church of England, is not the ſame with that in the primitive Church.</p>
               <p>Thus I have fully confuted three Numb. of the American Whig; and if he or his Aſſociates, have the leaſt Modeſty left, they will never mention this Matter of Diſcipline more.</p>
               <p>The 6th "Particular of his 22d Numb. is this,—<q>The Biſhop of the Appeal, is to be a grand Perſonage,</q> &amp;c. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="385" facs="unknown:011212_0197_0F862F386ADE4DE0"/>the American biſhops will be of great or ſmall bulk, the American Whig knows no more than I do; nor whether their "ſupport and dignity" will be great or little; but when he inſinuates, nay affirms, that the Appeal propoſes that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican biſhop ſhould be a 'grand perſonage,' and that a 'tax of four-pence' in the £. 100, ſhould be raiſed for his ſupport, he knows as well as I, that he inſinuates and affirms what is falſe, falſe, falſe.</p>
               <p>His triumph over Dr. Chandler, Mr Seabury, Ariſtocles, and Hierocles he may enjoy, "if he can;—only let not him that girdeth on his armour, boaſt himſelf as he as that putteth it off:" And let him remember, that it ill becomes Whigs, and Independents, to accuſe others of 'breach of promiſe or forgetfulneſs of engagements and proteſtations.'</p>
               <p>N. B. I have paſſed over No. XX of the American Whig as it is chiefly filled with a pretended letter from "one of the Society's miſſioners in America, to one of his Majeſty's chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains." The Whig ſays, "the public may depend on it to be genuine." But the public has been ſo often and ſo flagrantly abuſed with forgeries by him and his party, (of which the letter ſigned B. W. is an inſtance, lately detected) that his word is not to be relied on. In the firſt place, I abſolutely deny that the ſaid letter to one of his Majeſty's chaplains, was written by one of the Society's miſſionaries, and in the next had it been wrote by a miſſionary, I aver there is nothing in it that is unjuſt, or that may not be well defended. The infamous trade of forgery by the Whig and Co. is at preſent in a bad ſtate.—almoſt ruined, to the great ſatisfaction of all honeſt men.</p>

This propoſal was rejected; and the epiſcoplians are pleaſed to wonder forſooth that the affair ſhould be made a religious quarrel. What follows, is therefore to remove all wonder about the matter; and to ſhew that if there be any religious quarrel in the caſe, it is of their own making.

               <p>Theſe my friends and fellow citizens are facts, ſtubborn and inconteſtible facts, And now I appeal to the ſober judgment of every impartial man, to determine whether (if ſo it muſt be call'd) we or they have made it a religious quarrel. We are diſaffected to no man, of any Chriſtian perſuaſion on account of his religious ſentiments. Nor are we prejudiced againſt any epiſcopalian for his religion.—But it is the politics of the church,—its domineering ſpirit,—its perpetual ſtrides towards univerſal dominion,—its pride,—its power and its thirſt of domination, a thirſt not to be ſatiated but by our ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute deſtruction, that we are combined to oppoſe. Inſtead of any machination againſt them, I wiſh we could anſwer for our criminal paſſivity for half a century. Why have all theſe things been ſuffered? Many of them could certainly have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, had we not been wanting to ourſelves. Look around you, my brethren, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> tell me what poſt or what office is not engroſſed by them! Could all this happen by chance in a province where they conſtitute ſo ſmall a minority? not ſuch a ſeries of encroachments to be aſcribed to a concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of deſign for aggrandizing themſelves, and ſuppreſſing the diſſenters? Rouſe therefore my friends, and act like men! Exert yourſelves in the glorious cauſe of preſerving your liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Tranſmit them like an ineſtimable jewel, to your poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity. Suffer yourſelves no longer to be wheedled by their artifices. Let it ſuffice, and more than ſuffice us, that hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we have ſlumbered on ſupine and inactive. They want only a majority in the houſe of repreſentatives to have all the three branches of the legiſlature on the ſide of epiſcopacy: And then farewel, an eternal farewel, to our religious liberty! Then ſhall we indeed be made, (what one of them within
<pb n="391" facs="unknown:011212_0200_0F862F3A9FD62198"/>theſe ſix days, had the aſſurance to ſay we ought to be made,) 'Tributaries to the church.' Up therefore, and be doing. If you ſleep now, you ſleep as on the top of a maſt, and all beneath you is deſtruction and ruin. To avert the perdition which threatens you, preſerve inviolate your laudable combination.—Your only ſtrength conſiſts in your union. Let no ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem of theirs diſconcert it. As you have one joint intereſt to ſecure, act as if inſpired by one ſoul. The proſpect is encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging. Providence will not frown on your ſtruggles for liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Whatever be the iſſue, it is ours to uſe the means, and then to acquieſce in the diſpenſations of Heaven: But indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is certainly culpable. If we ſucceed, we ſhall lay a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent foundation for our privileges. If we fall, we glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly fall, by falling in the vindication of what is dearer than life itſelf.—In a word, ſhould we be diſappointed, let our diſappointment be improved, to a ſtill cloſer, and more intimate junction. Let it be improved to excite us to exert ourſelves upon every future occaſion, with greater harmony, and redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled vigour.</p>

               <p>INCITED by an inſatiable luſt of power, and ſpurr'd on by an ambition which increaſes in its proſpects, as it advances to an eminence, a turbulent faction in this province, have never
<pb n="394" facs="unknown:011212_0202_0F86302CE298FEA0"/>ceaſed blowing the coals of party ſpirit, till they have burnt forth into a blaze; <hi>divide et impera,</hi> is a favourite political maxim with them; accordingly as the church of England has been an obſtacle to their towring deſigns, they have ſought every means to deſtroy the friendſhip and harmony which has ſubſiſted between her and other denominations, that they might riſe to power over her ruins, and rule with abſolute dominion. Evidently with this intent was the 24th number of the American Whig written. Dr. Chandler after inconteſtably proving that a biſhop under the reſtrictions propoſed, could be no way detrimental to diſſenters, and that it is a privilege eſſential to the well-being of the church, urges, that any oppoſition of diſſenters to a plan of ſo harmleſs a tendency, would have in it the nature of perſecution—From ſo juſt an aſſertion, the American Whig takes occaſion to accuſe Dr. Chandler of inſinuating that the church had been grievouſly oppoſed by diſſenters; merely that he might with ſome degree of propriety and excuſe, inflame their minds by a high colour'd narration of the ſavage cruelty of churchmen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Strange that a ſplenetic crew, who ſince their fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap> origin, have been continually maligning, traducing, and diſturbing the quiet of all around them; who, diſcontented with the fre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt toleration any where granted, are continually diſcharging their venom at the boſom that nouriſhed them; who have never miſs'd one opportunity of perſecuting others, and aiming at the deſtruction of the church; that ſuch (I ſay) ſhould not bluſh to accuſe that religious ſociety, the charity and benevolence of whoſe members is every where acknowledged, and enjoyed by themſelves whenever they have petitioned for it.—The charges contained in this paper, and repeated in the 25th number, I ſhould with pleaſure refute; but the taſk is needleſs, ſince they have been totally obviated in a late paper,—are no way coincident with the ſubject, and would be improper at this ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>If the church of England in America is conſiderably diſtreſs'd thro' the want of an epiſcopate to ſuperintend her clergy, and to confirm her members,—if half her churches are deſtitute of clergymen to officiate in them and adminiſter the ſacraments,—if the epiſcopate deſir'd, would remedy theſe inconveniencies, and be of advantage to religion in general among us, and aſſiſt the propagation of the goſpel among the heathen,—if the biſhop is to be ſo abridg'd in his powers as that he cannot poſſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe the privileges of diſſenters,—if theſe <hi>poſtulata</hi> are true, and that they are ſo, Dr. Chandler has irrefragably evinc'd—the oppoſition of preſbyterians to ſo reaſonable a propoſal, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently cruel, invidious, and malevolent; and betrays a ſpirit,
<pb n="395" facs="unknown:011212_0202_0F86302CE298FEA0"/>ſcandalous to proteſtantiſm, and heinouſly criminal and nefarious.</p>
               <p>But ſays the American Whig, <q>I am ſurpriſed that any man, who has reſided but a few years in this country, and eſpecially a native, who cannot but be thoroughly acquainted with the genius and diſpoſition of its inhabitants, towards an eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal hierarchy, ſhould ſeriouſly ſet himſelf to urge a meaſure that hath ſo manifeſt a tendency to interrupt the peace, impede the population, and re-kindle a flame in his Majeſty's dominions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This objection is ſo far from having any truth or ſolidity in it, and has been conſidered ſo often in the courſe of theſe papers, that it ſcarcely deſerves attention. The diſſenters in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try (excepting a trifling minority) with the reform'd Dutch church are ſo fully convinced of the moderation and benefits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting from the eſtabliſh'd church, that they would rejoice in any method that could promote her intereſts, without damaging the liberties of others.</p>
               <p>An inſinuation that 'nine tenths of the colonies' have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conquerable averſion to biſhops, under the reſtrictions ſtated by Dr. Chandler, is a calumny that deſerves the ſevereſt reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The diſſenters in this country have imbibed the principles of freedom and moderation: They are not, they cannot be of ſuch an intolerant ſpirit, as to refuſe a proteſtant church the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of an epiſcopate that interferes not in their concerns.—Such aſſertions muſt give the enemies of the reformation cauſe to rejoice. and a fair plea to doubt of the boaſted mildneſs and charity of proteſtants. The temporal powers of Engliſh biſhops are not conſidered as inherent in their office—they are mere ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages confer'd by the ſtate (in conſequence of the alliance) to be employed in its ſervice. Theſe, if the church is eſtabliſhed, may be circumſcrib'd by an act of parliament, and if it is not—they cannot be exerciſed.</p>
               <p>The faith of treaties, the ſanctity of laws, and the fence of charters, will be the guardian of their privileges.</p>
               <p>Where then can be the obſtacle? Can they fear its increaſe in ſtrength?—The well-being, harmony, religious liberty and peace, of the various denominations in America, depend on this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. The preſbyterians are faſt increaſing in number—unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied (as they ever will be) with their preſent large participation of privileges, they are ambitiouſly graſping for more.</p>
               <p>Their aſpiring leaders pant to ſeize the chariot of power—in which if they are once mounted, they will drive furiouſly.</p>
               <p>The diſſenters experience the lenity and mildneſs of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of churchmen; they find them open hearted and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable, and in general deſpiſing the little views of party. On

               <p>Ah! where is that liberty that ſweetened the cup of ſorrow, and ſmoothed the brow of care?—that open benevolent religion, pitiful courteous and merciful as its author was merciful?—Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by ſuſpicious unforgiving hypocriſy, by noiſy confuſion, and wild uproar.—Should any one, ſtartled at the repreſentation, conceive this picture the product of a heated imagination,—let him recollect the days, when an unhappy monarch was brought to the block!—Where then was that liberty of conſcience, that purity of religion,—that illimited toleration, which were before ſo exultingly trumpeted! The weapons of the kingdom of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were ſeized on, to ſtabliſh the kingdom of light.—The well-wrought conſtitution of Britain, obtained at the price of the blood of our forefathers, tottered on its baſe!—Rapine extended its ſacriligious jaws to devour the offerings dedicated to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of learning!—and the ſword of faction was ſharpened for thoſe who would not bow down to the idol of preſbytery!</p>

               <head>From Mr. PARKER'S GAZETTE, Jan. 23, 1769. The AMERICAN WHIG, [No. XLVI.]</head>
               <p>LIBERTY is the gift of God to mankind; and a jewel of ineſtimable value. Had we retained our primitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence, we ſhould have enjoyed our primitive liberty. But the introduction of ſin into the world, introduced the neceſſity of putting the ſword into the hands of the magiſtrate, to protect the weak from the violence of the ſtrong. Hence the origin of government. We ſurrender a part of our liberty to ſecure the remainder; and thus it appears, that licentiouſneſs, or an unruly deſire in any man to do as ſeems good in his own eyes, is unfriendly to liberty; or in other words, that every true Son of liberty is a friend of good government, and in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the glory of that character. The government, I ſay, muſt be a good one; for to diſturb one that is deſtructive of the public felicity, or to oppoſe a tyrannical dominion, either origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally acquired by force, gradually erected on the ruins of a free ſtate, can never be called licentiouſneſs: For no man or ſet of men, could ever acquire a right to render the ſociety they are appointed to govern, as miſerable as it would have been without any government; and much leſs to make the members of it more wretched than they would be in a meer ſtate of nature. The happineſs of the people is therefore the law of laws, the ſupreme law. And hence it follows on the other hand, that as no government is or can be perfect in its plan, nor always faultleſs in the execution of its powers, reſiſtance is unlawful; unleſs, all things conſidered, there is a moral certainty of thereby promoting the happineſs of the community. The true Son of liberty will therefore abhor both tyranny and licentiouſneſs, and think it his duty to oppoſe every bad meaſure, whether attempted by prince or people, and conduct his oppoſition with a ſteady eye to the general good.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="401" facs="unknown:011212_0205_0F86302F23416BD0"/>Upon theſe principles we juſtify thoſe heroes of our own nation, who with their blood, purchaſed that glorious conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which after innumerable ſtruggles, acquired a perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent eſtabliſhment on the acceſſion of that ever memorable Dutchman, King William the third. By theſe principles alſo, the Sons of liberty in America, will be able to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate their attachment to the conſtitutional claims of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Engliſhmen; and the time is faſt approaching when the preſent threatning clouds, with reſpect to the conteſted right of taxation, will be diſſipated, to the honour of all thoſe who ſhall appear at the end of thoſe troubles, to have been cordial friends to the intereſts of the empire.</p>
               <p>But whatever ſhare any of us may claim in that harveſt of glory, let it ever be remembered, that His will be the greateſt, whoſe actions have been conducted upon the moſt generous principles, and with views of promoting the moſt extenſive felicity; and that the man who ſhall ſtickle to ſhut out one evil, and contribute to open a door to a greater, will rather deſerve cenſure than applauſe.</p>
               <p>He who really loves his country, will, to the utmoſt of his power watch againſt, and prevent every annoyance: But a man who is clamourous againſt one ill meaſure, and regardleſs of others equally miſchievous, can have no claim to true pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm: Such only wear it as a cloak to cover ſome ſiniſter deſign: The conduct of ſome of thoſe who in this city ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired honour by their oppoſition to the ſtamp-act, gives there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore juſt ground to ſuſpect, that they were not inſpired by that laudable ſpirit, which ſeeks the redreſs not only of one partial grievance, but will exert itſelf againſt every machination de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed for the ruin and deſtruction of their country. Let us attend to a few inſtances in which the patriotiſm of thoſe pretenders to the character of ſons of liberty, has been brought to the teſt; and their claim to it will be found to be emptineſs itſelf.</p>
               <p>Scarce had we concluded our exultation on the repeal of the ſtamp-act, before we heard of the execrable ſcheme for enſlav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole continent under the dominion of ſpiritual courts. The Biſhop of Landaff aſſures us, that the introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Prelates into this country, was the main deſign of erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſociety for propagating the goſpel in the reign of King William. Ever ſince that period they, have had their eye upon us; and now when the conqueſt of Canada bids fair for ſuch an increaſe of wealth, as to enable us to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the hierarchy, every exertion is made on both ſides of the water, to accompliſh the project.—Biſhops preach it up. Legacies are given for it. Our own clergy petition the King,
<pb n="402" facs="unknown:011212_0206_0F86302FE0C2B800"/>the Univerſities, and others in its favour. Private letters are written to ſolicit the aſſiſtance of men in power, Pamphlets and papers are publiſhed to wheedle and deceive the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans; and the late Arch-biſhop of Canterbury himſelf, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to defend the ſcheme, and in his anſwer to Dr Mayhew, who gave the firſt alarm, boldly preſumes without the royal leave, to intimate, that if any colony will ſignify its requeſt for a Biſhop, a Biſhop ſhall be ſent.</p>
               <p>As therefore the ſubjugating ſuch an infant country as this, to dignified prelates, muſt be its inevitable ruin; who would imagine that any perſon bearing the name of a ſon of liberty, would have heard of ſo portentous and alarming a project, without the moſt painful emotions! Upon all thoſe who really deſerved that honourable appellation, it had that effect; and the efforts they are making to vindicate the religious liberties of the people, are as vigorous as thoſe made in defence of their civil rights and privileges.</p>
               <p>Admitting that the wings of the American Biſhops may be ſo clipped, as to prevent them from doing us any injury; and that ſuch only are deſired as are of the primitive kind; yet ſurely it became the profeſſed aſſertors of liberty, to take pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſteps to obſtruct the ſcheme till ſecurity was given for this clipping, in order that all reaſonable jealouſy might be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved.—Inſtead of joining to allay the fears of others, till the remedy was impracticable, they ought to have aided them in driving the zealots for this pernicious plot, not only into a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avowal of it in words, but from urging it in any manner what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, before ſuch laws were enacted, as might put us out of danger. The proper ſteps were obvious. One denomination only was ſuſpected to befriend the ſcheme. The motions of the bigots among them were therefore to be narrowly watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I ſay their <hi>bigots</hi> were to be watched, becauſe it muſt be confeſſed, to the honour of the majority of the epiſcopalians on the continent, that they are as averſe to prelacy as any other proteſtants amongſt us. And to fruſtrate the deſigns of thoſe bigots, the ſons of liberty of that church, ſhould have joined all others in refuſing their votes to any candidate for an elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whoſe profeſſion of principles afforded any ground for ſuſpecting him a friend to the introduction of prelatic power into America. Nay, they ought upon the firſt notice of ſuch a deſign, to have petitioned the aſſembly for a moſt explicit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of our abhorrence of the meaſure, and the moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſupplication to King Lords and Commons, that no ſuch power might be ſuffered to diſturb the repoſe, and conſume the ſubſtance of this peaceable and proſperous country.</p>
               <p>The neglect of all this is truly culpable—Nay, ſome who
<pb n="403" facs="unknown:011212_0206_0F86302FE0C2B800"/>pretend to the character of ſons of liberty, ſeem to act as if they were ſtruggling to arrogate to themſelves the name, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have the fairer opportunity of deſtroying the ſubſtance. They clamour againſt the laws deſtructive of civil liberty, only to gain a credit and power to rob us of what is infinitely dearer to us, even the privilege of worſhipping God, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the dictates of our conſciences, and to make us, as it has been expreſſed, <hi>Tributaries to the church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the attachment of thoſe pretenders to the cauſe of liberty, was at beſt but partial, appeared inconteſtibly evident in the courſe of the laſt election for this city.</p>
               <p>The real ſon of liberty will conſider the buſineſs of an election, eſpecially at ſuch a critical juncture, as one of the moſt important concerns in which he can be engaged.—The freedom of elections is the grand bulwark of all our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, rights, and privileges, civil and religious; and it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable to all attacks except thoſe of corruption and terror. But will any man have the aſſurance to deny, that in the laſt elections, at leaſt one of thoſe batteries was ſerved, and that too by men who boaſt in the name of <hi>Liberty-Boys?</hi> And was not this manifeſtly to keep out a certain candidate merely for his attachment to the cauſe of religious liberty; and becauſe his abilities gave the enemies of it, reaſon to tremble for their dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſcheme of erecting a prelatical domination over all the other churches in the colony?</p>
               <p>There is no court to which we ought to reſort with more ſeriouſneſs, than the ſheriff's court of election. To preſerve our liberties and promote the common welfare, we ſhould ourſelves behave in it, and aſſiſt in obliging others, to demean themſelves, with the greateſt decorum.</p>
               <p>Every man who offers his ſervice to the public as a candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date, has a right to good uſage, and deſerves our thanks. Nay, if his offers are countenanced by the voices of any of his countrymen, there is a double reſpect due to him; and if he is inſulted, his electors are abuſed, and have reaſon to reſent it as an injury done to themſelves and the public. But were there none who pretend to be ſons of liberty, concerned at the late election, in tumultuous ſhoutings, diſplaying of colours, and other artifices, deſigned to inſpire terror into one of the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates, or his electors? Was not every part of the town alarmed by exhibitions purpoſely contrived to intimidate the inhabitants who befriended him? Yes, and thoſe inſulting ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations were made in the very court of election. Not to mention all the menaces and threats offered to the poor vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſome of whom were thereby terrified out of their birth-right, and treated as the moſt abject ſlaves, merely on the ſcore of their poverty.</p>

               <p>I'M very loth to exerciſe my office on any gentleman <hi>perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally;</hi> but, if any one <hi>will</hi> imprudently ſtand in the way of my <hi>toe,</hi> and thereby happens to be <hi>kick'd</hi> I can't help it.—He muſt blame himſelf.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>S—b—r—y</hi> (<hi>Whip</hi> No. 37.) gives us (as <hi>he</hi> ſays) 'a juſt and faithful account' of his <hi>adventure,</hi> in queſt of the name of the writer of the letter ſign'd <hi>B. W.</hi> and after all his ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, concludes, (as, it ſeems, he did at firſt) that the whole is 'a villanous piece of forgery,' in which <hi>B. W.</hi> Dr. <hi>Chauncy,</hi> Mr. <hi>Parker</hi> and Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> ſtand charg'd by him as perſons concern'd. Now as I am not acquainted with the neceſſary facts, I ſhall leave it to thoſe gentlemen, if they think it neceſſary, to vindicate their own characters: In the mean time, as <hi>one ſtory is</hi> often <hi>good only till another is told,</hi> I adviſe the reader to ſuſpend his judgment as I do. I beg leave however to make a few remarks on Mr. <hi>S's. 'performance,'</hi> as he calls it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. He gives Mr. <hi>P.</hi> a long ſtring of titles, evidently out of <hi>pure ſpite,</hi> being apparently as much diſpleas'd with him for <hi>printing,</hi> as with <hi>B. W.</hi> for <hi>writing</hi> the letter. 2. He ſays, 'the direction at the head' of it and, <hi>He thinks</hi> 'the date at the Bottom were in a different hand and ink from the other writing.' Had his aim been to prove the authenticity of the letter, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he wou'd have <hi>thinked</hi> otherwiſe, at leaſt as to the latter; and to the former he wou'd no more have ſuſpected <hi>Forgery,</hi> than he might have done in many a piece ſent to the preſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduc'd with a 'different hand and ink' for the ſake of the compoſers. 3. He accuſes Mr. <hi>P.</hi> of 'not complying with his promiſe in his own preamble:"—Now Mr. <hi>P. promis'd</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all, or at moſt no more than to 'ſhew the original letter to any perſon deſirous of ſatisfaction.' The letter Mr. <hi>S.</hi> owns Mr. <hi>P. ſhew'd</hi> him;—and what wou'd the man have had more? By being troubleſome, 'tis probable he obtain'd the knowledge of Mr. <hi>P's</hi> conjectures as to the author, which right or wrong, he wou'd fain improve to his diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. 4. Mr. <hi>S.</hi> contradicts himſelf. Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> he ſays, 'cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly avoiding mentioning <hi>Wentworth's</hi> name, but <hi>always</hi> expreſs'd himſelf by the term—<hi>the gentleman;</hi>' and yet he
<pb n="405" facs="unknown:011212_0207_0F86303104335140"/>owns Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> mention'd Mr. <hi>Wentworth's</hi> name no leſs than <hi>twice</hi> before. On the whole Mr. <hi>S.</hi> ſeems to have written his hiſtory in a great paſſion, to the beginnings of which, I doubt not, ſome of the gentlemen accuſed were witneſſes, as well as the 'gentleman of undoubted credit' his companion, in proof of which as well as other articles, 'tis a pity he did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure and publiſh <hi>his</hi> affidavit.</p>
               <p>I come now to conſider M. <hi>S's</hi> reflections on <hi>B. W</hi>'s letter, (<hi>Whip</hi> No. 38) His remarks on the <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>temper</hi> of it, ſo naturally put me in mind of <hi>his,</hi> that I ſhall confine myſelf to that alone. He is ſo much vex'd with <hi>Boſton,</hi> that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares he 'never was in it,—'has no agents in it,'—'ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver wrote a ſingle letter to any perſon in it,'—and <hi>'deſires to have nothing to do with it.'</hi> Mighty <hi>good humour'd</hi> this!—He likewiſe 'confidently' boaſts, that he has 'laid the <hi>Whig</hi> fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on his back.' What a pity it is ſuch a doughty combatant has no trumpeter!</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>S.</hi> ſeems to think <hi>B. W.</hi> has not acted in character. Not as <hi>a ſon of the church;</hi> becauſe he has ventur'd to reprove ſome of her hot-headed children.—Not as <hi>a friend to</hi> Her <hi>growth;</hi> becauſe he ſcorns to promote it by the dirty manure of miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation, and is ſo candid as to do juſtice to Dr. <hi>Chauncy:</hi>—Not a <hi>member of the ſociety;</hi> becauſe he declares he is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon like moſt of his brethren:—Not as <hi>a friend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and good manners:</hi> becauſe he has treated with ſome free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſo <hi>very Reſpectable</hi> a character as Mr. <hi>S's</hi>—and, not as <hi>a friend to truth and impartiality;</hi> becauſe impartiality, on this occaſion, oblig'd him to take the <hi>part</hi> of <hi>one</hi> of the diſſenters, and becauſe in his whole letter there is not <hi>One word of truth</hi>—but what is very unwelcome to Mr. <hi>S.</hi> Such a 'ſtickler for <hi>impartiality</hi> in writing' as Mr. <hi>S.</hi> had need to approve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a very candid inquirer after <hi>truth;</hi> and yet <hi>reader!</hi> (cou'd you have thought it?) this ſame gentleman, undertakes to decide on the propriety of Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi>'s anſwering the <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal,</hi> and ridicules him, as he wou'd <hi>an old horſe,</hi> in the ſame breath with which he 'deliberately declares,' that he '<hi>never read more than a dozen pages</hi> in' the <hi>Dr</hi>'s. pamphlet, 'and <hi>never intends to read a dozen more.</hi>' On this occaſion, I ſhall only remark, that I've known many an <hi>old horſe</hi> worth more than a dozen young—s</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>S.</hi> affects to be thought too manly to <hi>give any one,</hi> even a ſervant, <hi>the lie,</hi> when in effect he had juſt declar'd, that <hi>B. W</hi>'s letter was nothing but a <hi>pack of lies,</hi> and miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I hope indeed Mr. <hi>S.</hi> was not the perſon, who gave Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi> the lie, July 4th. 1768; but ſomebody certainly did: And even Mr. <hi>S.</hi> endeavours to juſtify him in it, by in effect
<pb n="406" facs="unknown:011212_0208_0F86303169720FC8"/>declaring that there is not one word of <hi>truth</hi> or impartality in <hi>B. W's</hi> letter.</p>
               <p>Whether <hi>B. W.</hi> are the initials of the letter-writer's <hi>Real</hi> name, or were by him ſign'd as <hi>W. X. Y. Z. &amp;c.</hi> have been by others. I can't pretend to ſay; but it wou'd doubtleſs greatly ſurpriſe Mr. <hi>S.</hi> (who has <hi>nothing to do with Boſton</hi>) to find that ſome one of thoſe gentlemen he mentions by name, had written the letter, and (whether miſtaken or not as to the perſon who <hi>ap'd</hi> an <hi>independent</hi>) had acted from nobler motives than Mr. <hi>S.</hi> can, it ſeems conceive of, <hi>viz.</hi>—than rev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

How apt ſome people are to diſcover unwarily the principles of <hi>their own</hi> conduct! But be all this as it may, I am ſo fully 'convinc'd' of <hi>Old Dr. Chauncy's</hi> good ſenſe, integrity, and veracity, that I muſt not, I cannot, alter my ſentiments, till Sq. <hi>T.</hi> Mr. <hi>S.</hi> or ſomebody elſe have advanc'd ſomething more convincing than they have ever yet done, to prove him a <hi>dotard, raſcal,</hi> or a <hi>liar;</hi> And therefore I can't believe Mr. <hi>S.</hi> will either procure 'bread for himſelf or family' (whatever he may for <hi>bears</hi>) by crying, <hi>go up thou bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head!</hi> or promote his uſefulneſs as a <hi>miniſter of Chriſt,</hi> by par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and publickly <hi>rebuking an elder.</hi> By 'ſuch attempts,' he has little reaſon to hope to '<hi>ſhake</hi> Dr. <hi>Chauncy's</hi> reputation' or <hi>
