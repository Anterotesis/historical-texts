            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>A Lieutenant of a regiment in gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon at St. Chriſtopher's died, and left his ſon an orphan. A particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar family had promiſed him on his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to take care of his boy, but he was wholly abandoned, and forced to keep among the negro children, and live on ſuch ſcraps as he could find.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate, he caught that loathſome diſeaſe called the Yaws, which became a new reaſon for giving him up to his fate.</p>
            <p>In this condition BABAY, a poor ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro woman, found him, took him to her hut, got him cured, and divided what food ſhe had with him, till he was able to work for himſelf. The firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney that he earned, went to purchaſe her freedom.</p>
            <p>

He was proſperous in the world, and took her home to his houſe and as long as ſhe lived afterwards, which might be upwards of forty years, treated her with the moſt reſpectful kindneſs. He gave her a very expenſive burial, and had a funeral ſermon preached over her. As this ſermon was delivered before people acquainted with her character, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſuch circumſtances as I wiſh here to remark, I ſhall give an extract of what was addreſſed to the ſlaves that attended her.</p>
            <p>"This good woman was like many of you a ſlave, and as ſuch laboured under every diſadvantage, which you can plead, for not doing her duty; yet, in this ſituation, ſhe ſhewed in her conduct the nobleſt fruits of religion and charity; a helpleſs child, left an orphan in a ſtrange country, far from relations, or even acquaintance to his family, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned by thoſe who undertook to raiſe him, from her alone could raiſe pity, or engage attention, when left by all of his own rank and colour, to periſh in a loathſome diſeaſe, though ſon to a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant

of the Public, with whom every true lover of his Country ſhould have ſympathized. She alone lodged him, nurſed him carefully, got him cured, and put him into a way to provide for himſelf.</p>
            <p>Take notice this woman was a chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and you will ceaſe to wonder. This inſtance of generoſity found in one of her condition, is a proof that noble and great actions are not, as many think, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to advantages of birth and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for ſhe had nothing to direct her but GOD'S grace working on a tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble heart, and this benevolent temper, ſhewed itſelf in every part of her beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour through life, and was accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her, with a true ſenſe of religion; or to ſpeak more truly, ſhe was charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble becauſe ſhe was religious.</p>
            <p>She was well inſtructed in what ſhe ought to know, and believe, and always acted upon thoſe chriſtian principles ſhe profeſſed to believe. She always ſpoke on religious ſubjects, with an
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037158_0005_100CD5E4CD0A5930"/>
earneſtneſs, ſeriouſneſs, and knowledge, which I wiſh were more general than I have found them among her betters; here then is a ſhining example of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, on your own level for your imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. "If ye know theſe things, happy are ye if ye do them."</p>
