            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS every invention, diſcovery, or improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is more or leſs uſeful and intereſting, in proportion as it contributes to the preſervation of health, life, proſperity, and ſatisfaction; and as the author of the following pages is perſuaded, that very material improvements were made in the treatment of the ſynochus icteroides or yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low fever, which lately prevailed in this city, and proved ſo deſtructive and diſtreſſing to its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, he thinks it his duty to lay the ſame before the public, together with his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and ſentiments on other circumſtances, relative to that diſeaſe; that if it ſhould ever appear here again (as there is too much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:026837_0005_0FD1E1F7176647B8"/>
to apprehend, unleſs much caution is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to prevent it, from our conſtant inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the Weſt Indies, where ſtrangers are ſeldom long exempt from it) phyſicians may not again be at a loſs for a directory, deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from actual experience and obſervation. He however does not pretend to have been the improver of the treatment, or the diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the means moſt effectual in the cure, which is recommended in the following pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. On the contrary, he believes they were adopted from the joint deliberations of the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of phyſicians, in conſequence of ſome of its members having obſerved their good effects when the diſeaſe firſt appeared, and was miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a <hi>higher grade</hi> of the bilious remittent fever of the autumnal ſeaſon. Inſtead of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to ſyſtematic arrangement in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing little production, he has contented him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with enumerating ſymptoms and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as they occurred to him, while enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in practice; and offering his ſentiments in the order in which they happened to ariſe.
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:026837_0006_0FD1E1FA5631B788"/>
By this method he hopes to eſcape the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pedantry: and though thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the ſtudied and formal arrangement of the ſchools, to the ſimplicity and order of nature, may condemn his manner, he hopes the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it contains, and the importance of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, will ſecure him the approbation of all thoſe who prefer utility to formality and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion. To men of taſte indeed, ſome apology is due for the imperfections of its ſtyle and compoſition; but if want of leiſure and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent interruption are ever admitted as an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology for a treſpaſs of this nature, he is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly entitled to ſome indulgence on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion; eſpecially as he can aſſure them, that truth has been his aim, his end the public good.</p>

            <head>A SKETCH OF THE RISE AND PROGRESS OF THE DISEASE.</head>
            <p>THE diſeaſe which we are about to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, made its firſt appearance in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtreet between Mulberry and Saſſafras ſtreets, the beginning of Auguſt 1793, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to have been imported by a veſſel which arrived in this port, and lay at a wharf in that neighbourhood the latter end of July.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr M. Carey's account of the riſe and progreſs of the diſeaſe, lately publiſhed.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:026837_0008_0FD1E1FDA5941630"/>
From this ſource it ſpread gradually by contagion over the greateſt part of the city; and was more or leſs rapid in its progreſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as people had more or leſs intercourſe with the ſick, and according as the weather was more or leſs cold: for though it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated by contagion, the ſenſible qualities of the atmoſphere had a ſurpriſing effect in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the contagion more or leſs active, as well as in its influence on the ſymptoms of thoſe labouring under the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>The greateſt number confined with the diſeaſe, was about the middle of October; but as the weather became cold and froſty, its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſion was ſo rapid that it appeared as if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by a mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>acle: for by the tenth of November, there was ſcarcely a perſon to be found with it.</p>
            <p>The whole number that died of this diſeaſe in the city, appears from the regiſters of deaths kept by the different religious ſocieties, to have
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:026837_0009_0FD1E2004A238CF0"/>
been about 3500. In the regiſters of the deaths which have been kept by thoſe ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, there is no diſcrimination made between thoſe who died of the yellow fever and of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſeaſes; and the whole number of deaths appears to have been 4048, from the 1ſt of Auguſt to the 10th of November; of which above <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>00 are ſuppoſed to have died of other diſeaſes. At one period there appears to have been more than eight thouſand perſons confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by it at the ſame time; though at that time near twenty thouſand of the inhabitants had retired from the city.</p>
            <p>That the long continuance of heat and drought which preceded this diſeaſe had no ſhare in its generation, is certain, from its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confined for ſome time to that part of the city where it commenced: for almoſt every caſe which occurred for the firſt week or two, could be traced to that ſource, and was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated to others in ſucceſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:026837_0010_0FD1E2055AB77658"/>
This fever correſponded in moſt of its lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and characteriſtic ſymptoms, with the ſynochus icteroides occidentalis, or yellow fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of the Weſt Indies. A fever of the ſame kind has prevailed here three times before, viz. in the years 1740, 1747 and 1762.</p>
            <p>In the year 1740, it was introduced by means of a trunk of wearing apparel, which had belonged to a gentleman who died of it in Barbadoes. The family to whom the trunk was ſent firſt took the diſeaſe; and from them it ſpread into the town, and deſtroyed above two hundred people; as we are informed by the celebrated LIND, in his treatiſe on fevers and infection.</p>
            <p>The only account I have been able to obtain reſpecting its appearance in 1747, is what is contained in Mr Lardner's letter, of which the following is a copy.</p>

                  <p>SINCE my laſt, a contagious fever has raged amongſt us, which admits of no relief, cure, or abatement; never intermitting to the laſt moment of life. It has carried off three of my moſt intimate acquaintance; among which are my dear friends Andrew Hamilton and Mr Currie. Philadelphia has been a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly place, and many whoſe buſineſs and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily would permit them, have fled the city. But the air is now become much cooler, and thoſe under the diſorder revive. The ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms (a pain in the head and back, vomiting, &amp;c.) are leſs violent, and the fever gradually abates. Meſſrs. Allen and Turner's family are yet under the diſeaſe; the one having loſt a near relation, and Mr Allen himſelf not out of danger.</p>
                  <p>September 24th. The yellow fever is ſtill amongſt us: yeſterday was buried young Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Powell who died of it.</p>

It is aſtoniſhing that the phyſicians of that time left nothing on record reſpecting ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive a malady. Perhaps if the notes of Doctors Zachary, Graham, Kearſley, and Cad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallader were inſpected, ſome important facts might yet be diſcovered. Dr Griffiths' mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who had the diſeaſe at that time is ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live.</p>
            <p>The third time of its appearance it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced (according to the notes of Dr Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of this city) about the latter end of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, by a mariner from the Havanna: it came to its height about the 25th of September, and from that time gradually declined, and was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely extinguiſhed by the middle of October. Neither the ſtate of the weather, nor the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of deaths which occurred at that time, are known, no regiſter having been preſerved.</p>
            <p>The fever at that time was circumſcribed to Pine or Union ſtreet Northerly, and three or four ſquares from thence Southerly, and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:026837_0013_0FD1E211EA762DA0"/>
extended from Water ſtreet, to Third or Fourth ſtreet Weſterly. Its firſt and greateſt ravages were about the New Market, which lay near the ſource where the diſeaſe origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated. It ſpread at that time, as the one we are about to deſcribe did, from family to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, as they happened to have intercourſe one with another.</p>
            <p>A fever of the ſame kind, alſo prevailed at Charleſton, South Carolina, in the years 1732, 1739, 1745 and 1748; an account of which has been given by Dr. Lining, and publiſhed in the ſecond Vol. Phyſical and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary Eſſays of Edinburgh. The diſeaſe each time that it prevailed in Carolina, was traced to ſome perſon lately arrived from ſome of the Weſt India Iſlands.</p>
            <p>We are alſo informed by Dr Lind, in his treatiſe on hot climates, that a ſimilar diſeaſe occurred in Cadiz, in Spain, the latter end of the ſummer of 1764, of which an hundred
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:026837_0014_0FD1E213B9CB1310"/>
perſons ſometimes died in a day; that its ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages were at that time entirely confined to that city, and that thoſe who retired to the country eſcaped it.</p>
            <p>Though the diſeaſe we are about to deſcribe was highly contagious, the influence of the contagion was circumſcribed to a narrow ſphere, for none but thoſe who approached near to the ſick, or to ſuch articles as had been in contact with them, or within the ſphere of their effluvia ſo as to be impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thereby were affected.</p>
            <p>All that ſhut themſelves up in their houſes, retired into the country, or avoided entering into infected houſes, and all intercourſe with the ſick, or infected ſubſtances, or with thoſe who viſited the ſick (for the idle curioſity of ſervants, particularly of the hired girls, was the means of propagating the diſeaſe more than any other circumſtance), though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly abroad in the open ſtreets, eſcaped the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:026837_0015_0FD1E21828B96E28"/>
diſeaſe without exception. The priſoners in the jail and work houſe—the penſioners in the poor houſe, and the patients and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants at the hoſpital, from whence all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the infected was excluded, alſo entirely eſcaped the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>There was ſomething however, in the ſtate of the atmoſphere in the city, or in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of the inhabitants, peculiarly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the operation of the contagion, very different from that of the country; for when any perſon with the diſeaſe was remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a few miles into the country, and even died of it, there is ſcarce an inſtance of its ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been communicated to any perſon in the ſame houſe, whereas when any one in a family took it and remained in the city, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and ſometimes the whole of the family, ſoon after took the diſeaſe<note n="*" place="bottom">This was alſo the caſe the laſt time it occurred at Charleſton, as recorded by Dr. Lining—and alſo at Cadiz in 1764, mentioned by Lind.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:026837_0016_0FD1E219643C0FE0"/>
Thoſe expoſed to the contagion generally began to be affected between the third and eighth day; we recollect ſeveral that were certainly attacked on the fifth day, one on the third, and two not till the tenth day after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure. Theſe were aſcertained by ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as could not have deceived us. Thoſe who had retired into the country, and again returned to the city during the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the diſeaſe, were affected more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily and earlier than others, after ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of the mind ſeems to have had great influence, in haſtening or retarding the effects of the contagion; thoſe under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of fear, which was the caſe with the majority, were ſooner affected after expoſure to the contagion, than thoſe who were leſs concerned. Every other debilitating power had a ſimilar affect, ſuch as an abſtemious regimen, too much fatigue, frequent purging, blood-letting, and expoſure to the night air,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026837_0017_0FD1E22156222B10"/>
without exerciſe ſufficient to keep up a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous circulation. But a lax ſtate of the bowels, and a moderate tone of the ſolids, appear to have contributed to render the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe more mild when it did attack thoſe who were not greatly under the influence of terror. Neither age nor ſex were exempt, not even infants at the breaſt—but thoſe that were fat, corpulent and indolent, were moſt ſuſceptible of the contagion, and ſuffered accordingly.</p>
            <p>While this formidable diſeaſe was making ſuch ravages in the city, the country for ſome miles around was never more healthy, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in dry and elevated ſituations. In the low and marſhy grounds, indeed, this was not the caſe; for at Harriſburgh on the Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quehanna, at Dover on the Delaware, and a few other places, bordering on rivers or large creeks, whoſe channels were almoſt exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their waters, by the long continuance of heat and drought, bilious fever, choleras, dyſenteries and cholics, were never known to be ſo prevalent and mortal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:026837_0018_0FD1E222C7314B18"/>
The French Weſt Indians, particularly thoſe from St. Domingo, who had taken ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter here, from the ſtorms of a ſanguinary war, almoſt to a man eſcaped the diſeaſe, though they made no uſe of any precaution for the purpoſe; while thoſe from France were as liable to it as the Philadelphians.</p>
            <p>The reaſon that the Weſt Indians were not liable to it, is perhaps owing to the reſemblance of the ſeaſon to that of the climate from whence they came; and to the effects produced by the frequent excretions of bile to which they are particularly ſubject, rendering the duodenum and biliary ducts inſenſible to the poiſon. For it is a ſingular though a notorious fact, that the diſeaſe ſeldom or ever affects any but ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers or new comers from a colder or more tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate climate, in the Weſt Indies; as we are informed by almoſt all the writers on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. But we were ſtrangers or new comers to it to all intents and purpoſes, with this diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that it was brought to us inſtead of our and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:026837_0019_0FD1E227B24DB368"/>
being taken to it; and for that reaſon were ſubject to its influence. There are however ſome inſtances mentioned by Hillary of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing communicated by contagion at Barbadoes, and of a few Creoles being affected by it. But this he ſays was very rare, and after the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe had become very malignant.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The lateſt writer on this ſubject, Dr Jackſon, informs us that no negro immediately from the coaſt of Africa has been known to be attacked by this diſeaſe; neither have Creoles that have reſided conſtantly in the Iſlands. Yet Creoles or Africans who have been abſent a conſiderable time, and reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in colder climates, whether in Europe or the higher la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of America, are not by any means exempted from it when they return to the Iſlands. Europeans, particularly males, ſuffer from it ſoon after their arrival in the Iſlands; but in general, after reſiding there a year or two, they are very rarely attacked by it. Nor has it ſcarcely ever been known to attack the ſame perſon twice, except accidentally, after his return from a different and colder climate. The remitting fever, on the contrary, attacks perſons of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, whether natives or foreigners. Nor are thoſe who have once had it exempt from its future attack: a fact which proves that there actually exiſts ſome eſſential difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two diſeaſes; or at leaſt it ſhews, that the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſeaſon or two deſtroys in the conſtitutions of foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, a certain aptitude or diſpoſition for the one diſeaſe, which it ſtill retains for the other. Perhaps this may be principally owing to the effects produced on the biliary ducts and duo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denum, by the frequent and copious ſecretion of bile, to which the inhabitants of Tropical climates are particularly ſubject: whereby they are rendered inſenſible to the contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this diſeaſe.</note>The negroes that were natives of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:026837_0020_0FD1E2293171F198"/>
were alſo liable to it, though not in the ſame proportion as the whites. This was not the caſe, according to the obſervations of Dr Lining, when it prevailed in Charleſton; for at that time there was not an inſtance of any negro being affected by it, though as much expoſed to the contagion as the whites. This with ſome exceptions, is alſo the caſe with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the negroes in the Weſt Indies; tho' Dr. Blane ſays he ſaw a black woman die with all the ſymptoms of it at Barbadoes, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving caught it from nurſing ſome ſeamen that were ill of it. The ſame author is of opinion, that the diſeaſe cannot be generated in any
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:026837_0021_0FD1E22DAA50C768"/>
place, unleſs the heat has been for ſome time above 75 degrees. It is aſſerted by Dr Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that thoſe who have once had the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, cannot take it a ſecond time: but we have ſeen ſeveral inſtances of its occurring a ſecond time here, where the circumſtances were ſo unequivocal, that it could not be fairly aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to a relapſe.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the contagion had reached the central part of the city, the diſeaſe ſpread with aſtoniſhing rapidity. In the courſe of Auguſt, there were more than 300 funerals; towards the cloſe of the month, twenty were buried of a day. During the greateſt part of this month, the mercury in the thermometer ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from 80 to 90°, in the afternoons; the ſky generally clear, and the winds Weſterly. From the 25th to the end of the month the weather was cloudy, and a ſmall quantity of rain fell.</p>
            <p>In September, the diſeaſe increaſed ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zingly.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:026837_0022_0FD1E22F2CB407E0"/>
In the courſe of the month, about 1400 citizens were added to the liſt of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality; towards its cloſe, from 50 to 90 were buried of a day, though the mercury now ſeldom roſe above 80°. The weather was moſtly fair; a few days were cloudy, but there was no rain. The wind ſtill weſterly. Throughout the month the heat was general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly moderate, and the weather uniform, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept from the 19th to the 23d, when it was unuſually calm, "deprived of the refreſhing breeze," during which the mortality was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than at any other period in that month.</p>
            <p>From this time to the middle of October, the diſeaſe proceeded with an increaſe of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, owing to the enlargement of the circle of contagion. From the 1ſt to the 17th, more than 1400 fell victims to the malady—but from the 17th, to the 1ſt of November, the bills of mortality leſſened rapidly, though not regularly. The whole number of the deaths in this month, amounted to near 2000,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:026837_0023_0FD1E2315FFA9988"/>
though one third of the inhabitants had for ſome time before deſerted the city, and retired into different parts of the country, as choice or chance directed.</p>
            <p>The thermometer was very variable all this month, generally below 80°, but above 50° until the 27th, from which time to the end of the month, it was always below 50°, and one day below 40°. The weather for the moſt part fair, though ſome rain fell on the 12th and 31ſt, and it was cloudy from the 25th to the end of the month. The wind ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally from the N. and N. W. till the latter end of the month, but from that time N. N. E. Towards the laſt of the month, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion declined apace, the funerals being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to between 12 and 20 a day. From this time the weather became more wet, cold and froſty, and the diſeaſe declined ſo rapid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that on the 9th of November, the fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals in all the grave yards only amounted to ſix. From this time every thing ſeemed to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:026837_0024_0FD1E2355F17C720"/>
ſink into that kind of placid calm, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſucceeds a dying ſtorm. The citizens who had retreated from the danger, now ventured back, and the ſtreets and various departments of buſineſs, immediately reſumed their former life and energy—commerce again ſpread her white wings, and penſive mourning melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, has ſince given place to the cheerful face of joy.</p>

               <p>The SYNOCHUS ICTEROIDES or YELLOW FEVER, derives its name from the inflammatory ſymptoms, with which it begins, becoming putrid in its progreſs; and from the yellowneſs in the eyes and ſkin, with which it is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally accompanied.</p>

               <head>DESCRIPTION OF SYMPTOMS.</head>
               <p>THE diſeaſe (whoſe ſymptoms are now to be delineated), was generally preceded by a ſlight indiſpoſition, ſuch as muſcular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, and ſenſe of laſſitude, on exerciſe or motion, drowſineſs, ſlight pain and giddineſs in the head, pain in the back and loins, defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

After this prelude, which ſeldom continued more than 6 or 8 hours, and ſometimes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſuch prelude at all, a chilly fit, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternated with glowing fluſhes of heat, came on, generally in the after part of the night, or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ore part of the day; which, after a dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the moſt part ſhort, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of 12 or 14 hours continuance, gave place to thoſe ſymptoms which deſignate a confirmed fever of the inflammatory type, which increaſed in violence as the day ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced; and continued with little or no vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, till towards morning, when ſome alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation with reſpect to violence was generally obſervable, but in ſcarcely any inſtance was there ſo much abatement as could be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called a remiſſion.</p>
               <p>The pulſe, after the feveriſh ſtate became eſtabliſhed, was generally quick and tenſe, and during the exacerbation, it was alſo full
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:026837_0027_0FD1E23E1E01C340"/>
and ſtrong. In the carotid and temporal arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in particular, it was ſtrong and throbbing; reſpiration hurried; the ſkin very hot and dry; and the face highly fluſhed; the eyes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably red, hot, and painful, as if irritated by ſmall grit or ſand; accompanied with a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing pain in the head, back, loins, and large joints, ſhooting from temple to temple, and extending from the loins to the hips and down the thighs; the thirſt conſiderable, but not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable; the tongue white, moiſt, and clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; the bowels either coſtive, or diſcharging thin, watery, and ſometimes bloody, ſtools; the urine high-coloured, cloudy, and ſmall in quantity; the ſtomach diſtended, painful, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and irritable, eſpecially after taking any kind of drink or aliment; frequently affected with ſick qualms, and more or leſs propenſity to puke, but ſeldom bringing up any thing; a ſenſe of ſtricture and oppreſſion at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordia, as if tight bound with a belt; great reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs, with moaning and ſighing; and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſhifting of poſture in ſearch of eaſe;

ſome confuſion of the intellects, attended with conſtant pervigilium; but ſeldom ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of the reaſoning faculty as to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to violent delirium; frequent hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhages from one or both noſtrils, during the afternoon exacerbations in young perſons of both ſexes; and in thoſe of one of the ſexes at two different periods of life. In ſome the head was moſt affected; in others the ſtomach. In perſons under puberty, ſymptoms of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drocephalus internus frequently occured in the courſe of this ſtage. In men verging on old age, the diſeaſe uſually began with ſymptoms reſembling apoplexy, unleſs prevented by a diſcharge of blood from the hemorrhoidal veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</p>
               <p>When ſtools were procured by art, the firſt were generally ſoft and white, but ſeldom bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious. The contents thrown out from the ſtomach were generally the drinks or aliment laſt received. Sometimes mixed with matter of a ſea-green colour and bitter taſte, but of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten

without either. The ſuffuſion and infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med appearance of the eyes, conſtantly increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in proportion to the violence of fever and date of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>The preceding ſymptoms which may be conſidered as limiting the firſt ſtage of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, continued with more or leſs violence from one to three days, and ſometimes longer; and then abated ſuddenly, ſucceeded ſoon after by the appearance of a yellow tinge in the eyes, face, and neck, or by a copious evacuation of bilious matter by ſtool; and the patient ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily recovered, except that his ſtomach remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed weak, and his appetite defective for ſome time: or no bilious ſtools taking place at the time, or ſoon after the icteroitous appearance became obſervable, the diſeaſe proceeded to the ſecond ſtage, in which there was a diminution of force in ſome of the ſymptoms; an increaſe in others; and an acceſſion of new ones. The inflammatory ſymptoms which before, in many reſpects reſembled thoſe of the <hi>idiopathic gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritis,</hi>

now became mixed more or leſs with ſymptoms of nervous affection. The pulſe though ſtill quick, was no longer full or tenſe; the reſpiration alſo continued quick and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried; and the ſkin, though leſs hot, was more dry and parched, except during the act of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting, and then the moiſture was only par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, chiefly about the neck and forehead. The tongue now appeared more dry and foul, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the middle; the thirſt became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable; the ſtomach ſo irritable, and the reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and propenſity to puke ſo conſtant, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be retained on it, but was caſt up the inſtant it was ſwallowed, accompanied with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtraining and noiſe; but the matter thrown up appeared very little if any changed in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, except being mixed with mucus and more ropy than when drank: the ſtomach was alſo conſtantly affected with a conſtant burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat, which occaſioned the moſt excruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating agony and diſtreſs. The anxiety at the precordia alſo hourly increaſed, and ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came inſupportable torture: the ſighing, reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:026837_0031_0FD1E244E59287C0"/>
and toſſing to and fro became perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; the eyes and countenance were expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of the deepeſt anguiſh and deſpair; and a delirium reſembling mania was by no means uncommon. As theſe ſymptoms became more diſtreſſing, the yellowneſs which before was faint and partial, aſſumed a deep orange or ſaffron colour, and extended itſelf over the whole ſurface of the body; ſo that the patient reſembled one with an obſtinate and invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate jaundice. When theſe ſymptoms had continued with increaſing violence to the end of the ſecond, or beginning of the third, day, ſometimes earlier, and ſometimes later, they all ſuddenly vaniſhed, and left the patient for a time perfectly eaſy and tranquil. But this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious truce, ſo flattering to the inexperien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as well as to the patient, was ſoon ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a different, and though leſs acutely pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, more hopeleſs and deſperate train of ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, which marked the third and laſt ſtage of this domeſtic tragedy. The whole ſurface of the body now became of a cadaverous cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

with the pulſe ſlow and ſoft, in ſome not exceeding 40 ſtrokes in a minute, but as regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar as in health. The reſpiration was ſlow and deep; and the yellowneſs of the eyes and ſkin appeared of a deep tawny or dull copper-colour; the tongue much cleaner and moiſter than in either of the former ſtages; the vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was alſo leſs frequent, but in a much lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger quantity when it did occur; and the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent always had ſome reſpite after emptying his ſtomach, till a large quantity of fluid was again accumulated; when it was again ſpout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in an enormous quantity, and general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The patient was generally at this time affected with a kind of cheerful delirium, imagining himſelf well: he could ſeldom be retained in bed, but walked about till exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with fatigue. The delirium was generally ſucceeded, the day following, or the day after,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:026837_0033_0FD1E24D26D0FB30"/>
by coma, from which the patient was occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally rouſed by vomiting and uneaſy dreams; and when rouſed, ſtarted up, and attempted to get out of bed; and when prevented, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſunk down again into a ſtate of ſlumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſenſibility; and if aſked, when rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from his coma, how he did, his conſtant reply was "very well!" As the debility in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, the face and breaſt became ſpotted, as if ſprinkled with ink; and a deep duſky yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and purple colour, reſembling blood ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in a bruiſed part, pervaded the whole ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of the body. The reſpiration now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came deep and ſlow, frequently interrupted by a ſobbing kind of ſighing and conſtant hiccup. Theſe were ſucceeded by dimneſs of viſion—difficulty of ſwallowing—loſs of ſpeech—rat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling in the throat—ſhort and convulſive breathing—ſunk and irregular pulſe—cold ſweats—and finally death.</p>
               <p>But in more protracted and leſs violent caſes, inſtead of the black vomiting and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:026837_0034_0FD1E24EA447C3F8"/>
the patient frequently became affected with ſymptoms reſembling thoſe which are commonly met with in a protracted and inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate ſcurvy: In theſe the countenance ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared bloated and livid, as well as yellow, and blood perpetually oozed from different parts of the body; particularly from the noſe, gums, and hemorrhoidal veſſels. Some had apthae or ſuperficial ulcerations, in the roof of the mouth, and in the throat, and parts which had been bliſtered; and ſome had a frequent vomiting, or rather gulping up of dark grumous blood from the fauces and ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, or a diſcharge of it by ſtool. Several in this ſituation, lived many days without any other morbid appearance, except a conſtant and diſtreſſing watchfulneſs; ſitting up or walking about conſtantly, but without any appetite or extraordinary thirſt, or apparent delirium; till, exhauſted by a ſudden hemorr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hagic diſcharge, or by a more gradual drain of blood, they ſunk inſenſibly into the arms of death, without a ſtruggle or a groan.</p>

When the diſeaſe terminated favourably, it was generally before the fifth day, frequently on the ſecond or third; and when it termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated fatally, it was generally on the fourth, fifth, or ſixth day; ſometimes earlier and ſometimes later; but when the patient ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the ſeventh day, without the acceſſion of the black vomiting, coma, or ſcorbutic ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, or great and increaſing debility, the diſeaſe generally terminated favourably.</p>
               <p>This was the moſt uſual appearance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of this formidable and too often fatal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, through its ſeveral ſtages. But there were very ſurpriſing variations in the appearance it aſſumed, both in reſpect to the duration of the ſeveral ſtages, and the ſtate of the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, according to the particular conſtitutions and temperaments of different patients, the ſtate of the weather, the manner of treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A ſketch of theſe we ſhall now proceed to
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:026837_0036_0FD1E2556560A638"/>
enumerate. In ſome caſes ſigns of debility in all the functions, and a putreſcent tendency in the whole ſyſtem, were apparent at a very early period of the diſeaſe. In theſe caſes the anxiety at the precordia was conſtant, the ſighing frequent—the yellowneſs of the eyes and ſkin became conſpicuous very early—the exacerbations and remiſſions of fever ſcarcely perceptible—the pulſe quick and weak, ſkin dry and parched, reſtleſſneſs and pervigilium great, vomiting conſtant, and on the ſecond or third day of a black colour—the ſtools alſo black and gelatinous—the ſtomach conſtantly affected with a violent cardialgia, or a burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heat, which the miſerable ſufferer ſaid felt as if ſcalded or burnt by a coal of fire; no poſture gave eaſe, and whatever was ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, except very ſmall draughts of toaſt and water, weak barley water, or ſimple ſpring water, increaſed the agony to the moſt exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite torture. It was in this form of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, that the method publiſhed by Dr Kuhn, particularly applied. And it was the form
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:026837_0037_0FD1E256E3FF1680"/>
in which the diſeaſe moſt frequently appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the month of Auguſt.</p>
               <p>In other caſes the generality of the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms reſembled thoſe of the autumnal remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, combined with jaundice—and in ſome no yellowneſs or black vomiting occurred at all; but in theſe the eyes were almoſt always highly inflamed for a day or two, but when a diarrhoea, accompanied with a diſcharge of bile ſpontaneouſly occurred, or was procured by purgatives or gliſters, the yellowneſs or icteroitous appearance was frequently pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented.</p>
               <p>It was often difficult to diſtinguiſh this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe at the beginning from the influenza, which was prevalent in the city, and ſpread over all the Southern ſtates and over the Weſtern ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, before the yellow fever had made much progreſs in the city. The influence of terror alſo occaſioned great variation in its ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms. That the uſual diſeaſe of the ſeaſon,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:026837_0038_0FD1E25C5BB57D98"/>
the remitting fever, was often blended with this diſeaſe, is by no means improbable. For though two epidemics ariſing from a change or alteration in the ſenſible qualities of the air, or from any inviſible miaſma diffuſed abroad to a conſiderable extent in the atmoſphere, cannot exiſt together, yet there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s nothing more certain than that a contagious diſeaſe, and a diſeaſe depending on climate, ſeaſon, and ſoil, may exiſt at the ſame time and in the ſame place. Of this we have ſeveral exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in the works of Lind, Ruſſel, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A preternatural diſcharge of bile, was by no means a common circumſtance in any form or at any period of the diſeaſe, as has been already obſerved. Diſſections made not only at Cadiz and the Weſt Indies, but alſo in this city, demonſtrate that this is owing to an inflammatory affection of the ſtomach, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odenum and ductus choledochus: And it is more than probable, that the black matter brought up by vomiting, was the ſphacelated ſurface of thoſe parts mixed with coagulated
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:026837_0039_0FD1E25DD4D42740"/>
blood, bile, and the contents laſt taken into the ſtomach. The white colour of the ſtools ſo common in the beginning of the diſeaſe, alſo indicated an obſtruction to the excretion of bile. When the fever was protracted, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulations of bile frequently took place, as was evident from the tenſion of the right hypochondrium, and the foetid and copious diſcharges coloured with that fluid, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently appeared after an active purge.</p>
               <p>Dr. Jackſon relates that while he reſided in Jamaica, between the years 1774 and 1782, he opened ſeveral perſons who died of this diſeaſe, and obſerved that the ſtomach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines had a dirty yellow appearance, and were highly putrefied, and much diſtended with wind—the liver and ſpleen generally enlarged in ſize, and the colour of the liver often of a deeper yellow than any other part of the abdominal viſcera—the gall bladder for the moſt part moderately full, and of a thick conſiſtence and black colour—the bilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:026837_0040_0FD1E25F2430C158"/>
ducts enlarged and filled with a ſimilar flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id, while the veſſels of the liver bore the marks of uncommon diſtention. A dark coloured turbid fluid was always obſervable in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the ſtomach, ſimilar to that uſually thrown up in the laſt ſtage of the illneſs; and the villous coat of that organ was alſo abraded in various places, and at the ſame time, ſpots were obſerved on different parts of its ſurface, which appeared to be incipient mortifications. The ſuperior portions of the inteſtinal canal, had alſo frequently a ſimilar appearance. From theſe and other diſſections, much light has been thrown upon the ſeat, and nature of this diſeaſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Jackſon on the fevers of Jamaica, p. 265.</note>

               <head>OF THE METHOD OF CURE.</head>
               <p>FROM the preceding account of the various forms in which the <hi>ſynochus icteroides</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the reader will at once perceive, that no one mode of treatment could be with propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety purſued; but that it was requiſite to vary it, as the ſymptoms indicated an inflammatory or putrid type, as well as to adjuſt it to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſtages of the diſeaſe. But in all caſes which began with inflammatory ſymptoms, whether they ended in thoſe which indicated putridity or not, the following treatment was found moſt certain and ſucceſsful. Blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:026837_0047_0FD1E273A8574158"/>
generally afforded relief in all caſes, when the activity of the arterial ſyſtem was evident; and the head and epigaſtrium were at the ſame time much affected: and this operation was found ſerviceable when repeated every ſix or eight hours, for the firſt twenty-four or thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſix hours after the eſtabliſhment of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm; and in every ſubſequent exacerbation ſo long as thoſe ſymptoms continued in any conſiderable degree<note n="*" place="bottom">The firſt blood drawn in the fever ſeldom ſhewed any white glutinous covering or ſize, but after the ſecond bleeding, this appearance was ſeldom abſent; though it was never thick or very tough. The craſſamentum was bulky, ſlat, and ſmooth, and never roſe into that cup-like or ſand-box <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rm which is common in caſes of pneumonic inflammation.</note>. To thoſe who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn bleeding under ſuch circumſtances, we may ſay with Sydenham, when ſpeaking of the plague, "they either did not bleed early enough, or too ſparingly." To thoſe accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to ſee frequent caſes of idiopathic gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritis, where the danger is ſeldom indicated fully by the pulſe, the propriety of this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice will be at once obvious. In conjunction
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:026837_0048_0FD1E2753972E8C0"/>
with blood-letting, mercurial purges were found more certain in their effects and more ſerviceable than any other kind; eſpecially when exhibited in doſes of from ſix to twelve grains, and repeated every ſix or eight hours till a copious diſcharge by ſtool took place; and more eſpecially when their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was promoted by mild laxative enemas, adminiſtered three or four hours after each doſe of the mercurial purge. Thoſe who have not had an opportunity of obſerving the good effects of this practice, will perhaps think it a very hazardous one. But when they conſider the difficulty of retaining the ſaline and leſs active purges on the ſtomach, and the very great difficulty of procuring copious evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by ſtool, without which the topical affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which obſtructs the paſſage of the bile could not be removed, nor the propenſity to puke relieved; they will change their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents; for, notwithſtanding the inflamed and irritable ſtate of thoſe parts, calomel in large doſes, paſſed the pybones, and occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:026837_0049_0FD1E27665B95170"/>
leſs irritation till it had reached the inteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, and was leſs liable to be caſt up than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other purgative.</p>
               <p>But, however preconceived theories might influence others, we who were not prejudiced in favour of any particular hypotheſis, and who had daily opportunities of ſeeing its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, not only in our own practice, but in that of others, are convinced that it was more certain in its operation, and in general as ſafe as any other.</p>
               <p>In a few perſons of delicate or infirm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, indeed it proved injurious; and particularly when adminiſtered after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory ſymptoms had ſubſided. When it proved injurious before the inflammatory ſymptoms were removed, it appeared to have induced an inflammation in the inteſtines, and a very painful and troubleſome teneſmus. And when it proved injurious in a later ſtage, it was in conſequence of the debility occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:026837_0050_0FD1E27C32957E50"/>
by its operation or the ptyaliſm, which too frequently ſucceeded the too frequent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious exhibition of it. Unleſs ſpeedy and decided meaſures are taken in this ſtage of the diſeaſe, all our future endeavours to remove it, will generally be ineffectual. And ſurely, in a diſeaſe which had foiled every method formerly employed, ſome innovation was juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifiable. Theſe caſes, however, were very rare in compariſon with thoſe wherein it ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated gently, and to good effect. As we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver adminiſtered it when putrid ſymptoms were prevalent or the debility very great, or in any ſtage of the diſeaſe, but the firſt; we cannot ſpeak with any certainty of its effects, under any other circumſtance or period.</p>
               <p>We ſeldom had occaſion, even in the firſt ſtage of the diſeaſe, when inflammatory ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms were prevalent, to exhibit mercurial purges after copious evacuations were procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, but found thoſe of a milder kind, ſuch as ſal. cath. crem. tart. or caſtor oil, generally
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:026837_0051_0FD1E27D29A62F88"/>
ſufficient to keep the bowels in a laxative ſtate, when the ſtomach would bear them, and when it would not, gliſters made of an infuſion of ſenae leaves, manna and common ſalt, with the addition of a little oil, generally anſwered the purpoſe. We found the moſt difficult part in the treatment, conſiſted in putting the ſtomach in a condition to retain any thing; the ſaline draught in the act of efferveſcence, ſo uſeful for that purpoſe in other fevers, ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom produced any permanent effect in this; magneſia taken in a draught of ſweetened wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſeemed to have a better effect when im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately followed by a draught of acid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verage; but there was nothing ſo certain as a copious diarrhoea when it could be procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.<note n="*" place="bottom">If in any caſe, the patient recovered by the means re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by the Weſt India writers, and adopted by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral, particularly by the French phyſicians who practiſed here during the prevalence of the diſeaſe, this fortunate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven appears to have been more owing to a favourable ſtate of the conſtitution, or to a lower degree of the diſeaſe, than to the efficacy of their feeble and imperfect method of treatment.</note> When on the firſt or ſecond day of
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:026837_0052_0FD1E27EDD0225C0"/>
the diſeaſe the face was greatly fluſhed, the veſſels of the tunica adnata very red and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid, and the patient was affected with feroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous delirium, reſembling that which occurs in phrenitis, he generally died in a ſhort time, unleſs immediately and copiouſly blooded, purged and reſtricted to a cooling and abſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious regimen.</p>
               <p>The antiphlogiſtic regimen was always found to agree better than that of the vinous or cordial kind; not only while the pulſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued full and active, but when it was low and quick, previous to the acceſſion of typhous ſymptoms. The patient was accordingly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to drink toaſt and water, lemonade, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marind-water, barley-water, and any other diluting, mild, ſedative drink, that was grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the palate, and reſted eaſieſt on the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</p>
               <p>Freſh air was conſtantly admitted into the ſick room, and cold vinegar and water fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:026837_0053_0FD1E2835A8421B8"/>
ſprinkled upon the floor. This was found much more refreſhing than flaſhing gun-powder, or burning nitre and charcoal in the chamber; as theſe latter, though they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh a quantity of pure air, always increaſed its heat; and thereby counterbalanced the good effects that might otherwiſe have been derived from them. The bed and body-linen were alſo directed to be changed every day, or eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſecond day at fartheſt.</p>
               <p>When a repetition of blood-letting during the firſt and ſecond day of the complaint, did not remove the pain in the head and back, and the diſtreſs at the ſtomach, and when every thing was vomited up as ſoon as taken; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe was immediately had to purging cly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and to the application of epiſpaſtics to the ſtomach and legs, or to the back and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the thighs: the latter method is prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Dr Hume of Jamaica, to any other; from a ſuppoſition, that an inflammation rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed on an inferior part, always relieves that
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:026837_0054_0FD1E285CB83D870"/>
ſubſiſting in a ſuperior one. At preſent it is ſuppoſed to be owing to a change of action, from one part of the ſyſtem to another.</p>
               <p>Opium was alſo frequently employed in a ſolid form as directed by Hillary of Barbadoes, with a view of relieving the vomiting; but in general was found to aggravate it. The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line draught given in the act of efferveſcence, or magneſia as already mentioned, had a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter effect, but was by no means certain: nor in fact was any thing elſe found to have any permanent effect on this ſymptom, except gly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, briſk purges, and bliſters. But theſe when judiciouſly and early applied ſeldom failed of affording relief.</p>
               <p>Baths of various kinds were occaſionally employed, but ſeldom with ſuch manifeſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as to induce us to ſay much in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, except waſhing the limbs with ſimple water of tepid warmth, to keep the ſkin ſoft, and take off ſtricture and reſiſtance from the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:026837_0055_0FD1E286EA4D8760"/>
ſurface. When the topical affection of the ſtomach was relieved, a ſolution of Rochelle ſalts, in thin veal or fowl broth, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a little common marine ſalt, was in general more certain and leſs irritating than any other laxative. (A drachm of this ſalt requires about two ounces of boiling water to diſſolve it perfectly.) The inflamed ſtate of the ſtomach deterred us from employing eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, or any antimonial preparations: but from the trials of others, we are convinced that they ſeldom were of ſervice, but often the reverſe. When purges produced copious, foetid and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious ſtools early in the diſeaſe, it generally terminated favourably and ſpeedily.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond ſtage of this fever, (which however, ſeldom took place when the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies beforementioned were early and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly employed and duly perſiſted in), we found a very different treatment proper, from that which was neceſſary in the firſt ſtage; for the inflammatory ſtate now, for the moſt
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:026837_0056_0FD1E289726419C8"/>
part, rapidly verged towards gangrene; and the muſcular weakneſs was ſuch as to render bleeding inadmiſſible; and the irritable ſtate of the ſtomach precluded all expectation from purgatives, as they were rejected as well as every thing elſe the inſtant they reached the ſtomach. Our only reſource, therefore, was in warm antiſeptic fomentations, applied by means of flannel cloths to the ſtomach, thighs, legs and hands, ſinapiſms to the feet, aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic and eſſential oils, or ſpices ſtewed in bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the ſtomach; or the application of bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the frequent exhibition of laxative gliſters; and after a free evacution, the injec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of bark decoction, and a few drops of laudanum, with ſome farinaceous or mucila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginous liquor, into the inteſtines—(here per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, waſhing the patient's whole body with cold water, and afterwards wrapping it in a blanket wrung out of a hot decoction, and the ſubſequent application of bliſters, would have been beneficial; but we were afraid to try them). Vinous and cordial drinks as

well as all kinds of aliment, invariably aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated this ſymptom, and encreaſed or produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the cardialgia; but ſmall draughts of cold water generally gave inſtant caſe. When by theſe means the topical inflammation of the epigaſtric region was removed, all the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms gradually ſubſided, and the patient reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. But when theſe means failed, and the black vomiting came on, accompanied with coldneſs, and a cadaverous appearance of the extremities, and a dark yellow and purple aſpect of the countenance, our practice was to employ a ſtrong decoction of peruvian bark—an infuſion of camomile flowers, and toaſt and water lightly acidulated with the elixir of vitriol, and in ſome caſes a mixture of brandy and water—and to direct gliſters com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of a ſtrong decoction of bark, with the addition of fifteen or twenty drops of lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, to be adminiſtered every two or three hours; applying at the ſame time, ſinapiſms and jugs of hot water, to different parts of the patient's body. We alſo directed all the

Hot ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced wine, wine and water, and various other liquors were often tried, but in general with ſuch bad ſucceſs, that we cannot recommend them in ſuch circumſtances. Hot brandy toddy, however, with the addition of a large quantity of powdered nutmeg, in conjunction with external heat and acrid ſtimulating ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, often had evident good effects.</p>
               <p>When indeed the diſeaſe began with great proſtration of ſtrength, and other ſymptoms which denote a typhous diatheſis, we found wine not only ſafe, but more uſeful than any other article. In theſe caſes alſo, the early uſe of the bark in various forms, together with the liberal uſe of laudanum and volatile ſalts were of ſervice; but that which was moſt particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo, was the ſhower-bath of ſalt-water, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied quite cold three times aday, the patient ſitting in an arm chair, in a large tub for the purpoſe, his head being previouſly ſhaved or covered with a thin bathing cap of oiled cloth.
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:026837_0059_0FD1E292A1F5E8A0"/>
But after the acceſſion of this ſtage, in which the black vomiting and coldneſs of the limbs were the moſt predominant ſymptoms, all at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to relieve were generally ineffectual.<note n="*" place="bottom">The principal aim to be kept in view in this ſtate of the diſeaſe, is to recal and ſupport the determination of the fluids to the ſurface. Death may be prevented, even after black-vomiting has appeared with all its terrors, if a remedy can be found powerful enough to excite the action of the extreme veſſels, and to recal the determination from the internal parts, to the ſurface of the body. For this purpoſe, we are told by Dr Jackſon, that he has employed alternately warm and cold bathing with ſucceſs: he has even wrapped the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in a blanket, ſoaked in water, in which a large portion of ſalt was diſſolved; or which had been ſteeped in hot brandy or rum; enjoining at the ſame time the liberal uſe of wine or any other grateful cordial, to be taken as warm as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in ſmall and repeated draughts. He alſo mentions ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard of ſeveral well-atteſted inſtances of perſons being relieved of the black vomiting and their lives ſaved, by plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful draughts of rum and water. In other caſes he thinks waſhing the whole body firſt with cold water, and then wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping it in the blankets ſteeped in hot brandy or rum, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving warm cordial drinks anſwered ſtill better. (See his Treatiſe, p. 226.) We found brandy and water and beef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tea reſted better on many ſtomachs, and ſtrengthened them more than any thing elſe, after the removal of fever and pain, and all the other ſymptoms except debility and dyſpepſia.</note>

When the diſeaſe did not appear to be confined more particularly to any one part of the ſyſtem than another, but was univerſally diffuſed; and when nervous ſymptoms with great proſtration of ſtrength, were conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly predominant, which was frequently the caſe during the greateſt part of the month of Auguſt, the treatment recommended by Dr Edward Stephens, a phyſician of great repute at St Croix, was employed with more ſucceſs than any other; of which the following is an abſtract. "The nauſea and vomiting may be relieved by an infuſion of camomile flowers, given frequently until the ſtomach is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently emptied of all crude matters.

               <p>Flannel cloths wrung out of ſpirit of wine, impregnated with ſpices, may be applied to the pit of the ſtomach and changed frequently. An injection containing an ounce of powdered bark, mixed with thin ſalep or ſago, to which a tea-ſpoon-full of laudanum has been added, ſhould be adminiſtered. Theſe injections may be continued every two or three hours, omitting the laudanum after the firſt—as ſoon as the ſtomach can bear medicines and nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, the bark may be adminiſtered in ſmall doſes—and as much madeira wine may be given as the patient can bear, without af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting his head or heating him too much. All emetics and violent cathartics ſhould be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If the bowels ſhould not be ſufficiently open, a laxative clyſter may be neceſſary, or a few grains of powdered rhubarb added to each doſe of bark, until the deſired effect is

produced. If diarrhoea ſhould prevail, it muſt be checked by ſtarch injections, blended with laudanum, by the tincture E. kino, Japonica, or a decoction of caſcarilla; for a diarrhoea, eſpecially when profuſe, is always injurious when the diſeaſe is in an advanced ſtage, or when the debility is great.</p>
               <p>If ſtupor, coma, or delirium ſhould come on, a large bliſter ſhould be applied between the ſhoulders, ſmall ones to the thighs, and ſtimulating cataplaſms to the ſoles of the feet.

               <p>We were led with other phyſicians of this city, to make trial of mercurial purges in the early ſtage of this diſeaſe, from having obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their good effects in bilious remittents, when ſymptoms of accumulated bile were preſent; and are ſurprized that the Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia practitioners never made trial of it in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, which the generality of them acknowledge is the moſt deſperate and mortal to which mankind are liable, and which has heretofore baffled all their ſkill; eſpecially as ſome of them imagine it to be only a higher grade of the bilious remittent, of tropical climates; and as mercurial cathartics are recommended oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally

With reſpect to blood-letting, there is much contrariety of ſentiment among the Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia phyſicians; the generality of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining the operation to the firſt and ſecond days, from the commencement of the diſeaſe, and to a very ſparing quantity: whereas Dr. Moſely adviſes it without limitation, even ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deliquium, and a repetition ſo long as the pulſe continues preternaturally quick, and the ſkin; exhibits much feveriſh heat. And Williams adviſes opening the temporal artery, when the pain in the head is great, and the fever high. But though Moſely is of the ſame opinion with Williams, with reſpect to purg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for relieving the irritability of the ſtomach, ſo long as the feveriſh heat is evident, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regarding the ſtate of the pulſe, he makes no mention of mercurial purges, but places his chief dependence on a ſolution of vitrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated tartar and emollient glyſters; and as ſoon as that is accompliſhed, has immediate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the bark in various forms, as may be moſt grateful to the ſtomach.</p>

Blane and Jackſon have given a more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate deſcription of the diſeaſe, but Moſely certainly underſtood its nature and treatment better than either, though he may perhaps ſometimes have carried his plan too far for the conſtitutions of the generality of citizens.

               <head>OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORIGIN AND NATURE OF THE CONTAGION.</head>
               <p>THERE is no diſeaſe on which the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of climate and ſeaſon is ſo conſpicuous as on the yellow fever.</p>
               <p>In the iſlands and countries within the tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pics, where the diſeaſe is generated, the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians who practice in thoſe parts have no idea of its being contagious; but becauſe it rarely attacks the natives of that climate, and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to foreigners from a colder climate, they
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:026837_0068_0FD1E2AA77F345D0"/>
aſcribe it to the effects of fatigue and heat, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure to night air, or to ſome irregularity, &amp;c. Numerous obſervations however prove, that it is highly contagious when conveyed to other countries, eſpecially in populous cities with cloſe built ſtreets, when the heat of the weather is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to, or exceeds that of, tropical climates. For examples of this, the reader is referred to Lind on Hot Climates; to Lining's account of its ſeveral occurrences at Charleſton, publiſhed in the 2d volume of the phyſical and Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Eſſays of Edinburgh; and to the hiſtory of its riſe and progreſs as it lately appeared in Philadelphia, publiſhed by Mr Carey.

               <p>The yellow fever, though it agrees with the typhus, jail or hoſpital fever, and the peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence in being capable of affecting ſound perſons under certain circumſtances, who hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to approach within a certain diſtance of its ſource, or of ſubſtances which have already been within that diſtance, and imbibed the contagious effluvia, differs materially from the former, in not being capable of producing any morbid effect in cold and froſty weather, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the heat of the chamber where it may chance to lurk, be raiſed and continued for ſome hours above fifty or ſixty degrees, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

               <p>Nor does it agree in its effects with the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmata, which ariſe from putrefying ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or from a marſhy ſoil in any one circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, except being extinguiſhed by cold and froſty, and perhaps rainy weather.<note n="*" place="bottom">See remarks on this ſubject, publiſhed in the Federal Gazette, dated November 18th, and Dunlap's American Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſer, December 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It is well known to every one converſant with medical ſubjects, that other contagious miaſmata are frequently generated in cloſe crowded or unventilated places, particularly in jails, hoſpitals and ſhips of war, unleſs the body and bed clothes are frequently changed and kept clean, and the air frequently renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in conſequence of the effluvia conſtantly iſſuing from the lungs and pores of the ſkin, at the ſame time that a portion of the pure and vivifying principle of the air, is gradually exhauſted by the ſame circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.

               </p>
               <p>May not the contagion of the yellow fever therefore be generated in the dirty, confined, and ſuffocating cabins of the unfortunate ſlaves, (who are deprived of the means as well as the reliſh for cleanlineſs and agreeable appearance, which actuates the minds of independent free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men), exalted into a peſtilential quality by long continued heat; and may not the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of the inhabitants from the ſame cauſe, in conjunction with the purity of the air from conſtant ventilation, be rendered incapable of

being affected by it; while ſtrangers, whoſe conſtitutions are differently diſpoſed, ſeldom eſcape?</p>
               <p>The putrefaction of dead animal matter can, have no ſhare in generating the diſeaſe, as it gives out nothing but a little hydrogen or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable air different from vegetable ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in that proceſs.</p>
               <p>To ſuppoſe with Drs Warren and Deſportes that the contagion by which the diſeaſe is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced and propagated, was firſt introduced into the Iſlands by a crew of ſick perſons that arrived there about the year 1730, from Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am in the Eaſt Indies; and that it has been foſtered there ever ſince, as the ſmall pox has been in other countries, would have ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of plauſibility, if like that diſeaſe it made no diſtinction between natives and fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners; and a greater or leſs number of the inhabitants were always affected by it: but as that is not the caſe, ſuch an opinion muſt be
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:026837_0075_0FD1E2BF2844AF70"/>
groundleſs. For inſtead of affecting the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, it is almoſt entirely confined to mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners from long voyages, and foul and crowded ſhips; and to ſoldiers confined in hoſpitals, or crowded together in huts or barracks. And when it happens to be conveyed to other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, its influence is entirely exerted upon the inhabitants of cities; and is obſerved to be moſt contagious in thoſe parts where the air is moſt confined and impure—when the days are very hot and the nights cool. Hence it appears, that in order to give effect to the contagion of this fever, it is neceſſary that there ſhould be a certain conſtitution of the air, in conjunction with great heat.</p>
               <p>Let us therefore enquire into the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which give this morbific conſtitution to the atmoſphere, that if the contagion ſhould ever be introduced here again, we may not only eſcape its effects by retreating into the country, but if poſſible, diſarm it of its power, and prevent it from ſpreading, and affecting thoſe who remain in the city.</p>

                  <pb n="70" facs="unknown:026837_0076_0FD1E2C443FD7818"/>
That all contagious diſeaſes receive their full force from a particular conſtitution or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the atmoſphere, appears certain, from a multiplicity of concurring obſervations made by different authors at different periods and in different countries. In what this particular conſtitution of the atmoſphere conſiſts, which in one year and in the ſame ſituation favours the ſpreading of contagion, and in another year in the ſame ſeaſon and in the ſame place, checks or extinguiſhes it, has been variouſly explained by different writers: but as no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation hitherto attempted is perfectly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, we beg leave to offer one which we think leſs exceptionable.<note n="*" place="bottom">See on this ſubject particularly the works of Sydenham, Ruſſel, and Lind.</note>
               </p>
               <p>During a long continuance of dry and hot weather, the atmoſphere becomes more or leſs charged with exhalations from various ſour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in proportion to the moiſture of the ſoil, &amp;c. which are more or leſs injurious to health,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:026837_0077_0FD1E2C69DB15D38"/>
in proportion to the quantity of animal and vegetable ſubſtances in a ſtate of putrefaction, which cover or are mixed with the ſoil, the reſpiration of animals, the combuſtion of fuel, &amp;c. while it is at the ſame time robbed by theſe proceſſes of a conſiderable portion of its vivifying principle, at preſent known by the name of oxygen gas, or pure air.. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the air is ſaturated by ſome other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or deprived of a portion of its vivify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing principle by ſome means or other; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we know from the moſt unqueſtionable obſervations, that it would always neutralize, correct, diſſipate, or precipitate the matter of contagion, however minute and ſubtle the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles may be of which it conſiſts. For it is well known that no contagious diſeaſe can ſpread, or become epidemic, on mountains, or on open and extenſive plains, where the ſoil is dry, cleared, and cultivated; whereas it is with difficulty it can be prevented in populous ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, with cloſe built ſtreets and narrow alleys, or in low champaign countries, where venti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is obſtructed by ſurrounding woods.</p>

In populous cities in ſultry weather the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations, from the vaults, privies, ſinks, ſew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, gutters, ſhambles, ſlaughter-houſes, tan-yards, from reſpiration, and the combuſtion of fuel, and a variety of other proceſſes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and art, are inconceivably great. Nor can ſuch exhalations fail of filling the air with a noxious maſs of inviſible corpuſcles; at the ſame time that the proceſs by which they are generated ſpoliates the ſame atmoſphere of a principle, on the preſence of which, both life and flame depend for their continuance.</p>

               <p>THE moſt effectual means of preventing the introduction of contagious diſeaſes into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſea-port town, is to erect at a convenient diſtance therefrom, four ſeparate hoſpitals, with large airy apartments. One of theſe hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitals to be appropriated for perſons with du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bious ſymptoms. A ſecond for perſons ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly infected. A third for convaleſcents from the diſeaſe. A fourth for purifying the body, the wearing apparel, and bed clothes:
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:026837_0080_0FD1E2CB23A1A0B8"/>
this laſt ſhould be provided with bathing tubs, and materials for fumigating. A bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Each apartment ſhould be ſeparated by means of a partition, to prevent any effect from each other; and ſhould have windows that will both ſlide up and down, for the admiſſion of freſh, and expulſion of foul, air. (For the manner of conſtructing theſe, ſee Mackiterick's Medical cautions.)</p>
               <p>Theſe hoſpitals ſhould be at ſome diſtance from each other, on as elevated and dry a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation as can be conveniently found. When a ſuſpected ſhip arrives, the whole crew ſhould be compelled by law to perform qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantine for 14 days at leaſt; the ſound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main on board; the ſick or indiſpoſed in a marine hoſpital or infirmary. By this it would be aſcertained with certainty, whether there was contagion on board or not.</p>

               <head>MEANS FOR PREVENTING THE SPREADING OF CONTAGIOUS DISEASES, WHEN THEY HAPPEN TO BE IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TRODUCED INTO A CITY.</head>
               <p>WHEN a contagious diſeaſe breaks out in a city, the moſt certain means of prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it from becoming epidemic, or from ſpreading, is to prohibit all intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſound and the infected; and to commit the diſeaſed to the care of perſons commiſſioned for that purpoſe. As ſoon therefore, as the diſeaſe appears in any fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, both the ſound and the ſick ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſeparated and removed to other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments, at ſome diſtance from the town,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:026837_0082_0FD1E2D4F0009EB8"/>
and a conſiderable diſtance from each other, and the houſe where the diſeaſe appeared ſhould immediately be purified by the means hereafter directed.</p>
               <p>Infirmaries for this purpoſe ſhould be built at the public expence, on dry and elevated ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations, particularly on the high and gravelly banks of rivers or conſtant ſtreams of water, open on all ſides to the free acceſs of the air, provided with every neceſſary, and ſupported at the public expence. But perſons in afflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent circumſtances though compelled to leave the city, ſhould be allowed to retire to private infirmaries at their own expence, provided they conformed to the rules of the public infirmaries, in every other reſpect.</p>
               <p>Every family in the neighbourhood where the infection prevailed, ſhould alſo be obliged under a heavy penalty, to remove to another part till all danger from contagion be over; and no perſon be permitted to return to an
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:026837_0083_0FD1E2D78044B1F0"/>
infected houſe, or to uſe any article where the contagion exiſted, till purified by the means hereafter directed. Nor ſhould any perſon who has recovered from the diſeaſe be permitted to return to the city, or to his own houſe, till he has after ſuch recovery, repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly undergone the ablution of both the warm and cold bath, changed every article of his cloathing, and performed a quarantine of at leaſt 14 days, ſo as to render his return per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſafe to the community.</p>
               <p>If proper attention had been paid to theſe directions, which have been collected from the moſt reſpectable ſources; and the ſubſtance of which was earneſtly adviſed by the college of phyſicians, the calamity by which all deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in this city ſo lately ſuffered, would have been prevented. And that a ſtrict and punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual obſervance thereof in future, will prevent the like calamity, we are as certain as we are of any axiom in natural philoſophy.</p>

In a letter from Dr Waterhouſe, the preſent reſpectable profeſſor of the theory and practice of medicine in the univerſity of Cambridge, Maſſachuſetts, dated September 28th, 1778, we find the following information reſpecting the means which have been found effectual for preventing the ſmall pox from ſpreading among the inhabitants of Newport, the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of Rhode-Iſland, when it happened to be introduced there, by means of any veſſel; and will apply equally well in preventing any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther contagious diſeaſe from becoming epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic.</p>
               <q rend="margQuotes">
                  <p>When a veſſel arrives in the harbour with the ſmall pox on board, every perſon with the diſeaſe is immediately taken by officers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the purpoſe, to Coaſter's harbour, a little iſland about three miles from Newport, where there is an hoſpital and every neceſſary provided for their reception and accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And the veſſel having a jack hoiſted in her ſhrouds, is obliged to perform quarantine.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="unknown:026837_0085_0FD1E2DD2C0516B8"/>
None of the bedding or wearing apparel made uſe of by the patients during their ſtay at the hoſpital, are permitted to be brought away; nor are the patients who recover from the diſeaſe, allowed to leave the hoſpital, till they have undergone ſeveral ablutions in warm water, and till at leaſt one week has elapſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their recovery, let the diſeaſe be ever ſo light.</p>
                  <p>When any perſon in the town is ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of having taken the infection, the family is obliged, under a heavy penalty, to give im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate notice to one or more inſpectors. If theſe, in conjunction with a phyſician, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the diſeaſe to be the ſmall pox, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily has little more to do with the patient; but he is from that time to the termination of the diſeaſe, wholly under the direction of theſe officers, who remove him to Coaſter's harbour. Formerly they carried the ſick perſon on a ſleigh in a box in form of a large cheſt, with a ſmall bed in it; the cover of which was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forated with holes ſufficient to ſupply the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:026837_0086_0FD1E2DEB8F423A0"/>
with air. But the inhabitants percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving that this formidable apparatus had all ill effect on timorous minds, diſcontinued the box, and ſubſtituted a ſedan chair. It has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened more than once, that the diſeaſe was ſo far advanced before it was known to be the ſmall pox, that the patient could not be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved without the greateſt hazard. In that caſe the ſtreet was boarded up; an advertiſement publiſhed in the news-papers, and guards pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to prevent any perſon from approaching within a certain diſtance of the houſe.</p>

               <p>HEAT, fumigation and lime-waſhing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be the moſt effectual means of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the contagion adhering to the walls, floors,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:026837_0087_0FD1E2E25BC37F88"/>
and furniture of houſes, and to bedding, wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apparel, and to other materials which have been expoſed to it.</p>
               <p>For this purpoſe the bedding and wearing apparel being hung on lines acroſs the room, iron pots placed on bricks in the centre, and at each corner of the chamber or apartment ſhould be nearly filled with alternate layers of powdered ſulphur or nitre, and charcoal; and a piece of oakum dipt in tar, to ſerve as a match, being placed in each pot, the fire-place being previouſly cloſed, and the windows ſhut down, is to be ſet on fire, and then the door to be ſhut; obſerving to let in freſh air occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally, and to relight them when extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but cautiouſly avoiding going in till the door and windows have been for ſome time opened to prevent ſuffocation.</p>
               <p>When this proceſs has been continued for three or four days, the door, windows, and chimney are to be opened, and left open day and
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:026837_0088_0FD1E2E479469CE8"/>
night for at leaſt a fortnight. By this time every particle of contagion will be perfectly extinguiſhed, eſpecially if the air of the room had been greatly heated immediately before the admiſſion of freſh air: for by great heat it is attenuated and diſſipated, and by cooler and pure air entirely changed in its nature and qualities, if there is any faith to be put in the experiments of the committee of phyſicians ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the empreſs of Ruſſia, to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intend the hoſpitals, when a peſtilential fever prevailed at Moſcow in the year 1771, related by Mertens in his medical hiſtory of that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe: or if the obſervations of the experienced Lind, and the intelligent Ruſſel, are to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited.</p>
               <p>For greater ſecurity, the walls of the houſe where infected perſons have lain, ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be white-waſhed with lime, and a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the ſame article ſhould be thrown into the privies, as it is a certain corrector of conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and putrefaction, as well as deſtructive to every ſpecies of animalcule.</p>

            <p>IT has not been from a want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to yourſelf, nor from inattention to the ſubject, that your letter of the 30th ult. was not ſooner anſwered; but the importance of the queſtions propoſed, has made it neceſſary for us to devote a conſiderable portion of time and attention to the ſubject, in order to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at a ſafe and juſt concluſion.</p>
            <p>No inſtance has ever occurred of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, called the <hi>Yellow Fever,</hi> having been ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated in this city, or in any other part of the United States, as far as we know; but there have been frequent inſtances of its ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been imported, not only into this, but

into other parts of North America, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing there for a certain period of time; and from the riſe, progreſs, and nature of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant fever, which began to prevail here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the beginning of laſt Auguſt, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended itſelf gradually over a great part of the city; we are of opinion that this diſeaſe was imported into Philadelphia, by ſome of the veſſels which arrived in the port after the middle of July.
