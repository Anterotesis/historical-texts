         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the Free and Independant Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the United States of North-America.</head>
            <p>THE happy period being arrived, in which we may in peace, take a review of the ſcenes, through which we have paſſed, and with calmneſs and impartiality exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine and judge of paſt tranſactions, encourages me to come forward, and to addreſs you, on a ſubject of infinite im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to myſelf, and of ſo much to you, as to excuſe me, from the making any previous-apology, on the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.—Perhaps I ought rather to make one, for my hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been ſo long ſilent, under the many heavy charges, brought againſt me, in the public papers, in America.— Neither a want of ſufficient proofs, to refute them, or any indifference, as to the opinion of my countrymen, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned my ſilence, but the reflection, that during the rage, and violence of war, and while party prejudices, heats and jealouſies, were in their full force, it was by no means the time for a cool, and diſpaſſionate diſcuſſion, of any ſubject, on which, appearances had already prejudiced the minds of the public.</p>
            <p>I reſolved to improve the firſt moment, of public peace, and tranquility, to appear, and to plead my cauſe, at your bar; during near three years of misfortunes, and exile, I have impatiently looked for it; I now flatter myſelf, that it is arrived, and in that confidence, venture to call your attention to my caſe.</p>
            <p>It is of ſome importance, to you, to know, if one, who formerly had your confidence, to a great degree, actually betrayed, and deſerted you, and was guilty of the frauds, peculation, and treachery, with which he has been charged, or if artful, and deſigning men, inimical to him, have tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the advantage of his weakneſs, or imprudence, to charge him with thoſe enormous crimes; to excite a general clamour againſt him, and from his ſilence, to infer in the ſtrongeſt manner, his guilt.—Though I may ſolicit your examination, of the ſubject, at this time, under very great diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dventages, yet I am by no means thereby deterred, from
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018438_0003_0FA76A155967F7A0"/>doing it; as yet, you have heard but one ſide of the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that at a time, when your ſituation, made you juſtly apprehenſive, and jealous of danger, from every quarter, and rendered you, as it were, feelingly alive in every pore; at preſent, when we are happily freed, from the alarms, and dangers of war, you will not refuſe, to hear the other part, and thereby become capable, of judging on the whole, with certainty, and with juſtice, to the accuſers, as well as to the accuſed; which is all I aſk, or wiſh for—unwilling to take up more of your time, than is abſolutely neceſſary, I ſhall not in this addreſs, recapitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the many ſurmiſes, and inſinuations, thrown out againſt me, by my enemies, in the courſe of their perſecutions of me, but confine myſelf, to the direct charges againſt me, which are all of them, comprehended under two heads:</p>
            <p>Firſt, that I was guilty of fraud, and peculation, in the management, of the public monies, committed to my care; and ſecondly, that after my return to France, in 1781, I wrote thoſe letters, which were intercepted, and publiſhed in New-York, from intereſted motives, and with the baſe and treacherous deſign, to injure my country; having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged myſelf in the intereſt of her enemies.</p>
            <p>If on an impartial examination of facts, you ſhall judge me guilty, of theſe crimes, nothing that has hitherto been ſaid, or done againſt me, will be deemed unjuſt, or too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere; but if on the other hand, you ſhall, from the moſt unqueſtionable facts, and circumſtances, find thoſe charges, to be falſe, and groundleſs, whatever weakneſs, or impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, you may find me juſtly chargeable with, you will at leaſt, acquit me of any thing criminal, and pronounce me to be <hi>"A man more ſinned againſt, than ſining."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My conduct in the early part, of the late conteſt, and until my leaving America, in April 1776, to go for France, in the character of Commercial, and Political Agent, and Commiſſioner for the United States, is too well known, to require my referring to any part of it.—The charges againſt me, originate after that period; previous to it, I had no charge of public monies. I arrived in France, in June 1776, and acted as ſole Commercial, and Political Agent, for the United States until the month of December following, when I received a commiſſion, from Congreſs, appointing Doctor Franklin, Mr. Lee, and myſelf, their joint Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018438_0004_0FA76A16285CEA90"/>Plenipotentiary, and I continued to act, in this character, until the firſt of April 1778, when in obedience to the orders of Congreſs, I left Paris, on my return to America, and from that period, to the preſent hour, have not been entruſted with the monies of the public, or with any public employ whatever; it therefore follows, that if frauds, peculation, and embezzlements, were practiſed, and committed by me, they muſt have been in, and during that period, that is between April 1776, and April 1778, —and that I muſt have committed them, in my tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions at Paris, where I conſtantly reſided; the time and place being aſcertained, the juſtice or injuſtice of this charge, will at once be ſeen, by an examination, of my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts, and diſburſements of public monies.—On the 4th of March 1778, I received a poſitive order, from Congreſs, to return immediately to America, to acquaint them, with the ſtate of their affairs, in Europe; in the reſolution of Congreſs tranſmitted and in the letter accompanying of it, to me, this appeared to be, the only motive, and object of my recall.—Though the treaties with France, had been concluded, and ſigned on the ſixth of February preceding, yet they had ſtill been kept ſecret, and by agreement with the Court of France, were not to be made public, in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, until intelligence ſhould be received, of their being arrived, and publiſhed, in America; But ſeveral circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, concur'd at that time, to induce the Court of France, to change their plan, and publicly to announce, to the Court of London, their having entered into Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Commerce, and Alliance, with the United States, and to diſpatch, with all poſſible ſecrecy, and expedition, the fleet then at Toulon, to America, under the command of the Count D'Eſtaing; and the Count D'Vergennes, and Dr. Franklin, joined, in adviſing me, to keep my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, and my intention to return, ſecret, until the fleet ſhould ſail, in which it was propoſed, that I ſhould em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark.</p>
            <p>At this time, moſt of the contracts, for ſtores, arms, cloathing, &amp;c. and for ſhips to tranſport them to Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, were compleated; the execution of thoſe contracts, had been principally under my direction, but though monies had been advanced, on all of them, the accompts of the contractors, had not been brought in for ſettlement,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018438_0005_0FA76A184E84A8D8"/>and it was impoſſible for me, if I literally complied with the order of Congreſs, and with the urgent requeſt, of the French Miniſter, and of Doctor Franklin, to go out in the fleet; to do any thing previouſly, towards the calling in, and ſettling the public, or even my private accompts; any attempt that way, would have defeated the ſecrecy, and diſpatch enjoined me—though nothing appeared in the order of Congreſs, or in any of their letters, which intimated, the leaſt diſſatisfaction, with my conduct, or any ſuſpicion of the faithful management, and applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of the public monies, yet as I had from the firſt, the misfortune, to have in Mr. Lee, one of my Colleagues, a moſt jealous, and artful enemy, and ſenſible, that many ill offices, had been done me in America, I was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſirous, to put off my return until all the tranſactions in which I had had, any concern for the public, ſhould be ſettled, and cloſed, but finally, I ſubmitted to the advice of Count D'Vergennes, and of Dr. Franklin, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented myſelf, with taking from Mr. Grand, the Banker for Congreſs, an accompt of all the monies, received, or paid out, on accompt of Congreſs, up to that time, this was all that was in my power to do, and as Mr. Grand, had mentioned in his accompt, the names of the perſons, to whom he had paid money, and as I carried out with me, the moſt honourable teſtimonials, from his Majeſty, from his Miniſter, and from my colleague, and intimate friend Dr. Franklin, of my zeal, and integrity in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of my country, I had no reaſon to apprehend, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cenſured, for not having ſettled, and brought out with me, all the public accompts, and their vouchers, in detail; but on my arrival in Philadelphia, I ſoon ſound, that my enemies, had been, to a certain degree, ſucceſsful, in poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning the minds of the public by inſinuating, that I had become immenſely rich, in the ſervice of the public, and conſequently that I muſt have been guilty of undue, and dishoneſt practices; and though I had been ſent for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly, to inform Congreſs, of the ſtate of their affairs, in Europe, and notwithſtanding the honourable character, I had ſuſtained, as their Political, and Commercial Agent in Europe, and afterwards as one of their Commiſſioners Plenipotentiary, I could not obtain an audience, of that body, until after ſix weeks attendance, and ſolicitation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:018438_0006_0FA76A19310BE0B0"/>
I then gave them verbally, a faithful detail, of the ſtate of their affairs, in Europe, and laid before them, Mr. Grands accompt of the receipts, and payments of monies, to the time of my leaving Paris; and requeſted, that if their had been, any charge or inſinuation againſt me, for miſmanagement, or neglect, that I might be informed of it, and be permitted to be heard, in my defence.</p>
            <p>I was not told of any, and though Congreſs appeared no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> way diſſatisfied, with the account, I then gave them, of the ſtate of their affairs, in Europe, and of my own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, in their ſervice, and though the ſettlement of the public, as well as of my private accompts, preſſed me to return as early as poſſible, to France, yet I could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any reſolution, of Congreſs, either to approve, or to diſapprove, of any part of my conduct, and though I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt daily ſolicited, for a ſecond audience, I did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain one, until late in December following.</p>
            <p>I then gave them a written narrative of my tranſactions, from my leaving America in their ſervice, until my recall and return,—Congreſs then appeared diſpoſed, to take the matter up, and to examine it, and to come to ſome determination, on the ſubject, a Committee was appointed to examine the ſtate of their foreign affairs, and into the conduct of their Commiſſioners, and Agents, and for greater diſpatch, the Committee were ordered, to meet every evening, Saturday and Sunday evenings excepted; yet that Committee never condeſcended to admit me to an audience, or to aſk me a ſingle queſtion, on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their enquiry.—And though I had been ſent for expreſsly, to inform Congreſs, of the ſtate of their affairs in Europe, yet their Committee, ſtudiouſly evaded, the giving me an opportunity of laying before them, any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation on the ſubject, or of explaining any part of my own conduct, while in their ſervice.</p>
            <p>During more than fourteen months attendance in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, I obtained but two audiences from Congreſs, and none from their Committee, whoſe proceeding, and report, if indeed they made any, were kept ſecret from me,—In December 1778, having waited five months in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, almoſt daily ſoliciting Congreſs to examine my tranſactions, while in their ſervice, I found that a party determined, on my ruin, had ſufficient intereſt, to prevent
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018438_0007_0FA76A52C645B680"/>all examination, and to bear me down, by the moſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying delay, and neglect; I therefore reſolved to lay my caſe, before 'my countrymen, and fellow-citizens, but on my firſt addreſs to them, Congreſs reſolved to give me an audience, and afterward appointed a Committee, as I have before mentioned.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018438_0008_0FA76A538C902BD8"/>the appointment of an auditor, to examine my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compts, and to aſcertain the only point in queſtion, with regard to me; but I heard nothing on the ſubject, until November 1781, when I received a reſolve of Congreſs, informing me, that by the appointment of a Conſul, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion was made, for the ſettlement of my accompts; but in a few days after, I met with Mr. Barclay the Conſul, who to my extreme ſurpriſe, and diſappointment, aſſured me that he h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> no inſtructions on the ſubject; and a few days after, I had the mortification, of learning, that my letters of May, and June preceding, had beed intercepted, and publiſhed in New-York, and that the moſt unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conſtruction, had been put on them, both in America, and in France.</p>
            <p>This placed me in a ſituation, in which I believe, but few men, have ever been ſo unfortunate, as to fall into.</p>
            <p>Proſcribed in my own country, and in France, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxions to the government of this country, I ſubmitted to a tedious exile, in Flanders, where I remained, until the treaty of peace, was concluded, but in the mean time, I tranſmitted my accompts to Congreſs, and ſolicited a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, and the payment of the ballance due to me; I alſo ſent duplicates of them to Dr. Franklin, and to Mr. Barclay.</p>
            <p>It is now more than eighteen months, ſince Congreſs have been in poſſeſſion of my accompts, it is more than five years, ſince I had either the money, or any employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the public entruſted to my management.</p>
            <p>Is it poſſible that any fraud or embezzlement commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by me, ſhould ſtill remain undetected? Had I been guilty of any, would not my enemies with all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of my accounts in their power, have pointed them out, and publiſhed them inſtead of charging me general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with being a defaulter for unaccounted millions?—In March 1778, Doctor Frankling aſſured Congreſs that he had been an eye witneſs of my conduct in France, while his colleague, and that I had acted the part of an able, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, and fathful miniſter, and to his knowledge had in various ways rendered great and important ſervices to my county

I know of no queſtion that can ariſe on this ſubject, except it be on account of the overcharge made againſt me by Mr. Soulier, which I have explained in my account, and letters before Congreſs, and referred to Mr. R. Morris to juſtify my explanation.</p>
            <p>Though the funds which I put into Mr. Delap's hands in June 1776, amounted to livres, 73870,14,11. and he received ſome remittances from Meſſrs. Livingſton, Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is, Alſop, and Morris, over what he paid out on their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; yet his diſburſements on account of Congreſs, and the ſums which I drew on him for on the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: So far exceeded the whole, that in December he refuſed my bills, and on the 31ſt wrote me as follows: <q>Time only permits us to inform you, that we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a letter from A.

Shinger's bill of the 20th of Auguſt, at 30 days ſight on Ford, Courtoys and Co. of Barcelona, which is likewiſe returned to us proteſted. We are ſorry for all theſe diſappointments; but in the preſent ſituation of affairs, we look on bills as no remittance, for ſcarce one in ten of them is paid. The bills you forwarded us for acceptance muſt be returned, or lie by until funds arrive, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I will not take up the time of the public, by attempting to deſcribe the diſtreſſed ſituation in which I found my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at that period,—The whole of my ſcanty funds ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, and indebt to near ten thouſand pounds ſterling on account of Congreſs, for which I had given bills in my private name, and which were refuſed by the Houſe on which I was directed to value myſelf, and through whom remittances were to be made to me, nor the advantages at that time taken of our embarraſſments to force us into a contract with the Farmers General for a quantity of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, to be delivered to them in France at little more than the one half of its then current price.</p>
            <p>It is well known, that the Commiſſioners obtained one million of livres to be advanced them by the Farmers Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral on theſe hard terms, and about the ſame time two millions from the Court, to be paid quarterly in the courſe of the year 1777. At ſome future time, I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mutually on the hiſtory of our ſituation at that peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, and of the whole of the negociation in France from my arrival in 1776 to the ſigning of the treaties of Paris in 1778, and to my recall. At preſent it is ſufficient to obſerve, that the money then received and promiſed, gave me as well as my colleagues a temporary relief—that the whole of it was paid into the hands of Mr. Grand, whoſe account now more than five years ſince laid before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, will ſhew to whom and to whoſe orders he repaid it. But if I received of him, as appears from his account, the above ſum of livres 69253 7 6, and of the others in the whole, with that ſum, livres 148045 16 5, only ſomewhat leſs than ſeven thouſand pounds; what muſt or can be ſaid of thoſe, who for four years ſince have been
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018438_0014_0FA76A5A10410E78"/>charging me in all your public papers, with being a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faulter for unaccounted millions? They could not have been ignorant of the ſtate of the public account ſo far as I was intereſted in them, they were on the files of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in America, and in the bands of Doctor Franklin in France, open for the inſpection of every one, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or curioſity might-excite them to an examination. But what were my diſburſements during this term of more than two years on account of the public, and for my time and expences? My account before Congreſs ſhew that they amounted to a much larger ſum than that which I had received, including my time and expences to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and during my attendance on Congreſs, and for my return to France, they amounted to livres 258,164 9 2, or, livres 110,118 12 9 more than I had received, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me a creditor for that ſum, equal to £ .4817 18 7½ ſterling. Mr. Arthur Lee in a letter to Congreſs of the 1ſt of June 1778, ſays, <q>
                  <hi>I find that the expence of living in character, cannot well be leſs than three thouſand pounds ſterling a year;</hi>
               </q> and adds, <q>

               </q> that is, livres 68571 per annum. I was as Mr. Lee expreſſes it, left to myſelf; yet from my leaving America in 1776, until my leaving Paris to return to it in 1778, I have not charged but about eighty thouſand livres for all my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of every kind; the remainder of the liv. 258,164 9 2 was for diſburſements on account of Congreſs, and for my time and ſubſequent expences, the particulars of which are in my account before Congreſs.</p>
            <p>Mr. William Lee made one journey to Vienna on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the public, and Mr. Izard who was at Paris for the education of his children, received while there a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from Congreſs to the Court of Tuſcany, but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver went out of Paris, or quitted his family on the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the public. The former of theſe gentlemen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſeventy-two thouſand livres, and the latter ſixty thouſand for their private expences; yet theſe men are among the loudeſt againſt me for an extravagant waſte of public money.</p>
            <p>And permit me here my countrymen and fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, to requeſt of you, that you will examine for your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or that if your diſtance from Philadelphia will not

But excluſive of the above ballance due to me, after accounting for all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies received by me, I am entitled to a commiſſion of five per cent on goods and military ſtores purchaſed by me, agreeable to orders received from Congreſs to the amount of livres 4756,393 17, which makes the ſum of £ .238,445 0 7, including expence of poſtage. Theſe goods and military ſtores I purchaſed previous to the arrival of my colleagues, in conſequence of the orders given me by the ſecret Committee of Congreſs, and on which I was promiſed the ſame commiſſion as was then given to other agents and purchaſers, which was uniformly five per cent; for the purchaſes made jointly with my colleagues, I have not charged any thing, being then in a different capacity, as joint Commiſſioner Plenipotentiary with them. Thus it appears that inſtead of being a defaulter, I am a credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the public's, and to a large amount; and of all the public creditors, perhaps no one has ſuffered ſo much in point of intereſt, certainly no one ſo much in point of character.</p>
            <p>But of this, I ſhall take notice on a future occaſion. I need not take up any more of your time at preſent on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I have ſhewn, and it will appear from them, that from my arrival in France in June 1776, to the Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber following, when joined by Dr. Franklin and Mr. Lee, I had had no money or next to none of the public's at any time in my hands; but on the contrary, was at that time in advance for my employers, and that afterwards until my return to America, I did not receive a ſum any way equal to my expences and diſburſements; and from that period to the preſent I have not had any public employ, or public money committed to my management. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond charge againſt me, is, on account of my having in May and June 1781, wrote my opinion of our public af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:018438_0016_0FA76A5BC98E59A0"/>to my friends in America, and adviſed peace and an accommodation with Great-Britain. I confeſs that the letters publiſhed by Rivington in New-York, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> mine, do not materially differ from thoſe which I actually wrote at that time, and which unfortunately for me were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by the enemy, and that they contain the undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed ſentiments of my heart at that time, on the then apparent ſituation of our affairs; but I never yet heard of its being deemed a crime in a free ſtate, for its citizens to give their opinion and advice on public affairs and meaſures. To ſuppoſe me to have been in the intereſt of the Miniſters of this country, and to have wrote thoſe letters to promote their views, is as abſurd as to ſuppoſe, that I amaſſed an immenſe fortune in the ſervice of my country; yet although my well known circumſtances and connections at that period, and previous to it, as well as ſince, demonſtrate the abſurdity and falſhood of ſuch a ſuppoſition; yet both the one and the other have been not only ſuppoſed, but poſitively aſſerted by certain wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in America, who ſtick at nothing however extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant.</p>
            <p>I can hardly imagine, notwithſtanding the late and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent proſperous ſtate of our affairs, that any one can have forgot the ſituation in which they were in 1781, when I wrote thoſe letters, and previous to the ſurrender of Lord Cornwallis and his army at York. In May and in June 1781, the Britiſh forces were in the poſſeſſion of the whole of our ſea coaſt, from the Cheeſapeak ſouthward, and while they ravaged and diſtreſſed the inter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The army under General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington was too weak of itſelf for any offenſive opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Congreſs had neither money or credit ſufficient to put it on a more reſpectable footing.

Accidents and circumſtances unforeſeen at that time, and thoſe extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improbable ones, joined to a neglect or breach of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders on the part of the Britiſh, gave the French ſleet that ſuperiority, which alone decided the fate of Lord Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis and of his army at York; had not this event hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, of which when I wrote there was not the moſt diſtant probability, the war muſt have terminated againſt us in that campaign. In this I was ſupported by the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous opinion of the beſt judges on the ſubject then in America,—was it a crime in me to write from Europe to America, in the ſame ſtile in which our Generals and leading men wrote to their friends in Europe? My let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have been publiſhed, their's have not; this is the ſole difference, except the cruel circumſtance of mine having been publiſhed by the enemy, at a time when our danger was over, and when the publication could ſerve no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, but to ruin me in the opinion of my countrymen. At the time of my writing, every thing conſpired to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me, that France had only her own intereſt and that of Spain in view, in the war, and that however, it might terminate, ſhe would be very far from conſulting our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, in the peace, perſuaded of this, I wrote it, to be my opinion, and for this I have been deemed an enemy, and traitor to France, as well as to the United States.</p>
            <p>But have not events in part juſtified this opinion of mine? You beſt know, by what intrigues, the French Court prevailed with Congreſs, to order our Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, not to ſign any treaty with Great-Britain, without the knowledge, and conſent of the Court of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles, and thus to put our future peace, liberty, and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry abſolutely into their power—nor can you I preſume be ignorant, that the Court of France, having thus bound us, began to take off the maſk, and to take meaſures with, and to propoſe terms to the other powers, for excluding us, from the fiſheries, and for ſupporting the extravagant claims of Spain to Eaſt-Louiſiania, and that our Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, alarmed at this, wiſely ventured to break the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſent them from Congreſs, and to ſign the prelimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry articles, without either the knowledge, or the conſent,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018438_0018_0FA76A5E0F0B9000"/>of the Miniſters at Verſailles.—Are not theſe well known facts, abundantly ſufficient to juſtify me, for having in 1781, entertained ſuſpicions, of the ſincerity of France, in her profeſſions of diſintereſted friendſhip to the United States?—By our treaty with Great-Britain, we are enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to a right in her ſhare of the Newfoundland, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va-Scotia fiſheries, but has not France wholly excluded us, from any in hers?—Does not France, at this time, encourage, and ſupport Spain, in her claims to the richeſt, and moſt extenſive, part of the territory, allowed by Great-Britain, in the late treaty, to belong to us? Theſe attempts are not marks of friendſhip, but are the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equivocal characteriſtics, of that inſidious, intereſted poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, which I pointed out in my letters, and warned my friends to be on their gaurd againſt.—In my letter to Mr. Morris, I gave him my opinion, with reſpect to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate of our commerce, under independant ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the grounds, on which I was led to form it, and I ſhall be happy, if experience (which alone can decide in ſuch caſes) proves that my opinion, and reaſoning on that ſubject, were erroneous and ill founded.—Apprehenſive at the time, and diſtreſſed by the thought, that we muſt ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fail in the conteſt, and in ſuch caſe, ſubmit to the laws of our conquerors, rendered imperious, and ſevere from their ſucceſs, or that if ſucceſsful ourſelves, that in the ſituation, in which our country muſt be, on the peace, burthened with heavy taxes, on account of the public debts, contracted by the war, and ſtill heavier, for the future ſupport of independant ſovereignty, and at the ſame time, expoſed, to the evils ariſing from internal factions, and diviſions, and from our jarring, and incomparible inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts; that our democratic governments, which we had eſtabliſhed in Congreſs, and in our ſeveral States, would not be found to have ſufficient energy, and coercion, to eſtabliſh, and maintain ſuch a degree, of order and of due ſubordination, as muſt ever be indiſpenſibly neceſſary, in all governments, to prevent anarchy, and confuſion; and that in ſuch a ſituation, independant ſovereignty, inſtead of proving a bleſſing, muſt become the heavieſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

This opinion of mine, has been deemed a crime in me, little ſhort of that of high treaſon.— But it ought to be remembered, that this was my opinion, and that I communicated it, to my friends, at a time, when our proſpects, were gloomy and diſcouraging.— But we now enjoy independant ſovereignty and peace, on the moſt favourable and honourable terms, and have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained every thing, which we either hoped for, or demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and happy indeed ſhould I be, were I certain, that none of the evils, which I apprehended in 1781, were ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther felt, or feared by my countrymen, at this time, in ſuch caſe, I ſhould be contented to be ridiculed or even pitied, for my weak, and gloomy forebodings in 1781.— But General Waſhington in his circular letter ſays, that <q>It is a queſtion yet to be decided, whether the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt ultimately be conſidered, as a bleſſing, or a curſe.—A bleſſing or a curſe, not to the preſent age alone, for with our fate, will the deſtiny of unborn millions, be involved.</q>—I aſk, that theſe expreſſions, of the General, after the great object of independant ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, has been obtained, and ratified, and confirmed to us, by treaties, may be compared, with the expreſſions, in my letters of 1781, on the ſame ſubject, and that my countrymen, will then ſay, if it was a criminal deſertion, of the cauſe of my country, or if it was an unpardonable weakneſs, and deſpondency of mind, in me, at that time,

               </gap>, circulated in the United States, and in this country, reſpecting me: they tell me that it has been affirmed, and generally believed, in America, that I am rich, and in the moſt affluent circumſtances, from money made in the ſervice of my country; that I received a pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to a large amo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nt, from this government; that I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate with General Arnold, and that I had done every thing, in my power, ſince my being in England, in prejudice of our commerce, and in particular, that I had aſſiſted, in the writing of a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>amphlet, entitled, Obſervations on the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican Commerce, publiſhed by Lord Sheffield.—Now in any other circumſtances, than thoſe of the preſent, I need do nothing more, than to declare, that thoſe reports are totally falſe and groundleſs, and call on the authors to produce their evidence, if they have any in ſupport of them; but it ſeems that there are caſes, in which a man muſt be put to prove ſimple negatives; every news paper report, tending to calumniate one, already unpopular, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of equal authenticity with <hi>proofs from holy wri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>uired a fortune, to myſelf, true, but the accompts of thoſe agents and contractors, have, one only of them excepted, been examined and paſſed by Congreſs, or their auditors.—The only perſon, who has not had his accompts paſſed by Congreſs, has received their unanimous thanks, for his ſervices rendered them, in the ſupplies ſent out by him; the preſumption from this, at leaſt is, that Congreſs could have no doubt of the integrity and fairneſs, with which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> conducted that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair.—Whence
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:018438_0024_0FA76A6286E8B510"/>then could I have accumulated a fortune, in the ſervice of my country? It is true, that had Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs paid me, the balance honeſtly due me, I ſhould have been at eaſe in my circumſtances, for by that means, I ſhould have received, ſome compenſation, for the heavy loſſes, which I ſuffered by the depreciation, but this they have not done;—while in the ſervice of Congreſs, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in two commercial adventures, I was ordered by the ſecret Committee, to aſſume, and act the part of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant.—But in both of thoſe, I was unfortunate, in one a total loſs, by capture; in the other a failure of the man, to whom I had given the direction of it, left me a great looſer by it.—It is delicate and even cruel, for a man, who has been in trade and means, if poſſible, to return in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that line, to expoſe his private circumſtances, in point of fortune, otherways I could give the moſt convincing proof, that of the moderate fortune, of which I was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed in 1774, I am not at this time, maſter of the one half.—I have not at any time been extravagant, when all the funds of Congreſs in Europe, were open to me, my accompts will ſhew, that I lived but in a moderate ſtile.— I was not in a diſſipated, or extravagant line of life, while in Philadelphia, waiting the deciſion, or orders of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; on my return to France, I was obliged to borrow money of Dr. Franklin, and of other friends there, for my ſupport; are theſe marks, or evidence, of my having made a fortune, in the ſervice of the public? Do they not prove the contrary? But my acquiting myſelf of one charge, may give ſome weight, ſome probability to the other, ſince if thus reduced, and obliged to borrow for my private expences, at that time, I might the more eaſily, have been tempted, to accept of a penſion from this government.—But Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, though attentive to their own intereſt and that of their friends, and liberal of the public monies, on certain occaſions, never have ſuch an overflow of it, as to give it away at hazard, or to thoſe, who cannot render them or their cauſe, ſome immediate ſervice.—If every man is to be bought, at a certain price, the purchaſer will alſo eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, the value of the man, he deals for, and not throw away his money, in the purchaſe of one, who can be of no kind of uſe to him; Of what uſe in 1781, could I have been of, to the Britiſh, or to any other Miniſter? I had no
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:018438_0025_0FA76A634603CF68"/>public truſt or ſtate ſecrets which I could betray, had I been ſo diſpoſed.—My popularity and influence, in the United States, had been deſtroyed, by the calumnies, publiſhed againſt me, in Philadelphia, and by the neglect and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude of Congreſs, I moſt certainly could offer nothing to the Miniſter, and he could expect nothing from me, there did not exiſt, any foundation, for a contract be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, if my neceſſities at that time, might have urged me, to ſeek for relief, from any quarter, or by any means, ſtill the Miniſter, to whom I muſt have applied, would not have parted with the public money, ſolicited and ſcrambled for, by ſo many of his friends and ſupporters, to one, who had been declaredly and openly his enemy, without ſome proſpect, without even a certainty of an equivalent—I had none to offer, none to propoſe—what circumſtance, what action of mine, from my return to France in 1780, to this hour tends to ſupport this charge, of my being in the pay of this government? I never cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponded with any one of the Miniſters, or their agents, if they really had any in France.—The Honourable Mr. Walpole with whom I contracted, a very intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, ſoon after my return to Paris, had ever been in the oppoſition in Parliament, yet in the Philadelphia papers, I ſee him mentioned, as being the agent, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged me in the ſervice of the Britiſh Miniſters.—But to render this charge even probable, it ought firſt to be ſhewn, at leaſt, that after my return to France, I had it in my power to be of ſome ſervice to this government, and that I actually performed, or attempted to perform ſome ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to it, but neither of theſe, can be ſhewn, or any thing tending that way.</p>
            <p>My letters of 1781, contained no ſentiments which I attempted to co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of what ſervice could my declaring of my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at that time be to the Britiſh Miniſters? I had loſt my popularity and influence with my countrymen, and my opinion and arguments were not likely to be attended to, or to have that weight which they might otherwiſe have been entitled to. But the publication of my letters in New-York, is a ſtrong proof that I was far from being regarded as a friend, or as engaged in the Britiſh intereſt by their Miniſters or by their officers. Had not the Count de Graſſe unexpectedly arrived on our coaſt with a ſuperior fleet, Lord Cornwallis and his army, inſtead of ſurrendering themſelves priſoners of war, would have been victorious, and but for that, and other circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces unforeſeen and extremely improbable at the time I wrote, the campaign of 1781 muſt have terminated deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively againſt us; this was not ſimply my opinion, it was the opinion of our ableſt and moſt experienced Generals. In this ſituation had my letters been publiſhed, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents might have had ſome weight with my countrymen, but to publiſh them immediately after events had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicted my predictions, ſerved no purpoſe but to expoſe me to ridicule and abuſe. Had I been in the ſervice and pay of this government, would its Miniſters have taken this effectual meaſure to deſtroy my influence with my countrymen, and thereby render it impoſſible for me to be of any future ſervice to them? Nothing can be more extravagantly abſurd than the ſuppoſition. But if I was in the ſervice of thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> government, why, after the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my letters had drawn on me the reſentment of my countrymen, and the epithets of a deſerter and betrayer of the intereſts of my country, did I not venture over to this country, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ho were the moſt zealous for inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, and the moſt ſevere againſt Great-Britain and every thing in it, made no ſcruple of going over to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don on their private affairs, while I remained in Flanders in ſo obſcure a ſituation, as to render it impoſſible for me
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:018438_0027_0FA76A64C10F4168"/>to be eitheir of ſervice or prejudice to any one; and dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eighteen months, neither wrote a ſingle letter to any one in Great-Britain, or received any from thence, except on account of a few books and other trifling articles which I could not procure elſewhere. If from my arrival in France in 1780, to the ſigning of the preliminary articles, I had any other correſpondence in this country, let it be made to appear, I boldly challenge my accuſers to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the leaſt proof of any; full two months ſince, it was publiſhed in the news-papers of this city, that I had been at Court, and was preſented to his Majeſty, had an audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the Duke of Portland, dined with Mr. Fox, &amp;c. &amp;c. while to this hour I have not even ſeen his Majeſty, or any one of the royal family, except the Prince of Wales at a diſtance and on horſeback, nor have I any greater knowledge of any of the other great perſonages, with whom it has been aſſirmed that I am on ſuch terms of intimacy. If it were not ſo, I could have no intereſt, no motive to deny or to conceal it.</p>
            <p>But the truth is, that the ſtile of life which my circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances have obliged me to take up, has prevented my forming a numerous acquaintance, either at court or in the city, the former I have never ſo much as entered, and moſt probable never ſhall. Soon after my arrival in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Gen. Arnold called twice on me at my lodgings, and was ſhewn into my chamber without being announ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, be appeared not to reflect in how different a ſituation he now was, from that in which he formerly ſtood, when we were in the habits of the moſt intimate friendſhip; I therefore very freely put him in mind of it, and he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued his viſits, and I have not ſeen or ſpoke to him for more than five months paſt.</p>
            <p>I my letters of the 10th of June 1781, to Mr. R. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, publiſhed in New-York by Rivington, I gave my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion what the ſtate of our commerce would be on a peace, and on the confirmation of our independant ſovereignty, and I gave at large the reaſons on which I had formerd that opinion, by an unfortunate accident; the contents of that letter have been made public, and to them I refer; hitherto I have ſeen nothing to contradict the ſentiments I then entertained on this ſubject, but many things to confirm me in them, though I moſt ſincerely wiſh that
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:018438_0028_0FA76A6733DB0640"/>experience, the infallible teſt of truth in ſuch ſubjects, may finally prove them erroneous, and my arguments and concluſions to have been ill founded.—But neither for ſometime before, or ſince my being in this country, has it been in my power, had I been diſpoſed, to do any thing to the prejudice of our commerce, and I can with great ſincerity declare, that intereſt, as well as a diſpoſition in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant of intereſted motives, will ever lead me to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove every opportunity, to do what little may be in my power, to promote the commerce of my country, on the ſucceſs of which, its future happineſs and proſperity, ſo greatly depend.</p>
            <p>If preſent or future events juſtify my apprehenſions in my letter to Mr. Morris, am I to blame? Thoſe events do not, and cannot depend on me;—what grounds have we to expect more from Great-Britain, than what other aliens and foreigners are entitled to? Or than what we are indulged with, by other nations, in their Weſt-India poſſeſſions?</p>
            <p>All the Spaniſh and Portugueze American ports, are ſhut againſt us, and againſt all the world, the Dutch ports of St. Euſtatius and Curacoa, which iſlands produce noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are open without reſerve to us, but Surinam and Dema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rara, productive colonies, have never been but partially open, nothing which could be ſent to them from Europe, to any advantage, was allowed to be received from us, nor any thing which Holland had a demand for in Europe, to be taken by us, it has ever been much the ſame, in the French iſlands, and we are not by the treaty, entitled to any thing more in future; the protection and government of the Weſt-India poſſeſſions, coſt the European powers large ſums, will they be at this expence, and give other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the trade of them?</p>
            <p>This nation was the firſt in Europe which ſaw its own intereſt, with reſpect to commerce, in a true light, and by the navagation act, came to a reſolution, to reſerve the moſt certain all the profits of trade, that of the carrying buſineſs, to its own ſubjects.—That act was the corner ſtone, on which the Britiſh commerce and matine roſe, and on which it ſtill reſts.—Can it be expected, that this government ſhould at this time repeal, or violate that act? Or that it ſhould be diſpenſed with, in our favour? They
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:018438_0029_0FA76A70B45B4A30"/>who expect this, look for what I am convinced will never happen; ever ſince the exiſtence of the navagation act, all the maritime nations, in Europe, have been adopting meaſures, in ſome degree ſimilar, and now when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce has become the firſt object, with all of them, and is ſo well underſtood, they muſt neceſſarily purſue the ſame ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>The armed neutrality was a mere temporary expedient, France furniſhed her iſlands with proviſions by it, but ſhe loſt the commerce of them, for the time, ſhe ſupplied her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with timber, and naval ſtores, and manned her ſleets by it, but ſhe laid the ax to the root of her navigation and commerce, ſo long as it exiſted, and ſhe was ſo ſenſible of this, that on the day of ſigning the preliminaries for peace with Great-Britain, ſhe gave orders to exclude all foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from her Weſt-Indies; and the Dutch who expected to gain, loſt the moſt by the armed neutrality; the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it, and the war, into which their republic was drawn by it, will be long and ſenſibly ſelt by their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, perhaps never recovered.</p>
            <p>The great object, with Lord Sheffield, is to urge this government, to perſevere in a ſyſtem, which for more than a century paſt, the nation has never deviated from, and which all the maritime, and commercial nations in Europe, are now coming into.—Can any one complain of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, on this account? Or ſuppoſe that the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, would not have done this, without foreign advice? Without information and counſel given by me? It is too ridiculous to merit any ſerious obſervations, or comment on, yet inſinuations and reports of this kind, once ſpread have a moſt ſurpriſing, and laſting impreſſion on the minds of honeſt, and unſuſpecting people, who judging of others by themſelves, cannot ſuſpect that any one, can be baſe and wicked enough, to take up his pen, merely with the view of impoſing on them.</p>
