            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Publiſher TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>I Was adviſed by ſome pious Perſons, who deſire Peace and Union amongſt Chriſtians, to re-print this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, in hopes of its good Effect on all impartial Readers.</p>
            <p>The Arguments being wholly Scriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, are not only convincing, but mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with ſo much Charity, that few Books of Controverſy in Religion can expect a better Reception.</p>
            <p>Upon a ſerious peruſal of this Piece, it will appear clear and evident, That whoſoever juſtly ſuſtains the Character of a Miniſter of the Goſpel of Chriſt, hath, beſides his Internal Qualifications, an External Viſible Commiſſion deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, by thoſe who have Power and Authority to grant it: From whence theſe Inferences do naturally flow.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ii" facs="unknown:002417_0003_0FDB3E1907DA0A50"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who freely own that the Power of Ordinations was firſt veſted in the Apoſtles, and from them, through all Ages ſince, in a ſucceſſion of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> from whence they derive their own Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinations, are to be acknowledged true Miniſters of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> That it is a daring Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to intrude into the ſacred Function, without a regular deſignation to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of it. See <hi>Numb. 16.40. 2 Sam, 6.6, 7. 2 Chron. 26.19, 20, 21, 22. Heb. 5.4, 5.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That People ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after all the Aſſurance they can attain to, that they have the Means of Grace in the Word and Sacraments, duly adminiſtred and diſpenſed unto them, by Perſons fully authorized for thoſe holy Offices. For ſince the <hi>Prieſt's Lips are to preſerve Knowledge,</hi> the People ought to be ſatisfied that they are really ſuch, at whoſe Mouth they <hi>ſeek the Law.</hi> And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That it is a very criminal Preſumption, and an unſufferable Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:002417_0004_0FDB3E1C6A6FFBB0"/>
in ſome, to value their Gifts at ſo high a rate, as to think themſelves by the virtue of them, entituled to the Miniſterial Office, without being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Impoſition of the Hands of thoſe, whom Chriſt has ordered to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide over the affairs of his Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That ſince there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching before God's Altar, without the appointed Rites of Conſecration, nor any medling with his Inſtitutions with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his Order and Command; Thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders of the ſacred Services, cannot be ſaid to be the <hi>Ambaſſadors of God,</hi> or accounted the <hi>Stewards of the Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries of Chriſt,</hi> who preſume to touch thoſe holy Things, with their unhallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hands, and like <hi>Saul,</hi> would ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice without a Call, <hi>1 Sam. 13.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.</hi> For thoſe who offer <hi>ſtrange Fire before the Lord,</hi> their Incence muſt be <hi>an Abomination to him, Levit. 10.12.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Tho' we can by no means queſtion our Saviour's Gifts and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, yet he did not enter upon his Miniſtry, until he was ſolemnly inaugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:002417_0005_0FDB3E1E4C10C2A8"/>
into that Office; for he glorified not himſelf to be made an High Prieſt, but he that ſaid unto him, <hi>Thou art my Son,</hi> which was ſaid unto him at his Baptiſm, <hi>Luke 2.22.</hi> So when he was about to leave the World, be Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned others to go upon the great Embaſſy of Reconciliation, to tranſact in his Name, and proclaim and ſeal his Pardons, ſaying, <hi>As my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you:</hi> Whereupon he immediately gave them the power of Cenſures and Abſolutions, <hi>John 20.22, 23. Matth. 28.19, 20.</hi> And they alſo before their Death, imparted their Power to others, by Impoſition of Hands. Thus the Apoſtles ordained ſeven Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, <hi>Act. 6.5, 6.</hi> among other Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to <hi>Preach</hi> and to <hi>Baptize,</hi> in the Exerciſe of which Offices we find St. <hi>Philip,</hi> one of them, diligently employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Acts 8.1</hi> &amp;c. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ordained Elders in every Church, <hi>Acts 14.23.</hi> And thus St. <hi>Paul,</hi> who had ordained <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> appointed <hi>Titus</hi> to ordain El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in every City in <hi>Crete, Tit. 1.5.</hi> And that theſe ſacred Offices ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:002417_0006_0FDB3E1FC4066D10"/>
in a regular Miniſtry to the end of the World, is undeniable from <hi>Math. 6.18.</hi> and Chap. <hi>28.19, 20.</hi> and <hi>Eph. 4.11, 12, 13.</hi> And finally, that there was a preheminence of Juriſdiction and Authority in ſome of theſe Church-Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces over others, is plainly proved in this Treatiſe, in the Apoſtolical Dignity (to which the Epiſcopal muſt needs ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed) over the <hi>ſeventy,</hi> and the <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons;</hi> and St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Epiſtles to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> where we find many marks of the Power of thoſe <hi>Biſhops</hi> over their inferiour <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as to Ordain them, or upon occaſion to promote them to a higher Order, to Judge and Cenſure them, and if the caſe required, to proceed to Depoſition. This is the ſtanding Miniſtry that the Church of <hi>England</hi> claims a Part and Lot in: This is the Nature and true Notion of a Goſpel Miniſtry, as we find it founded by our Saviour and his Apoſtles.</p>

            <head>A Modeſt Proof OF THE <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> Settled by Chriſt and his Apoſtles IN THE CHURCH.</head>
            <p>MY deſign is at preſent, to repreſent to the World, what was the primitive Model, or Form of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; what was ſettl'd by our Saviour, and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in this point; and that from what is recorded of the matter in the Books of the New-Teſtament: This is evident from the Title-page; and the end of this undertaking is in order to let all Parties contending for various Forms ſee which is really the right one, with which if they compare their own, they
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002417_0008_0FDB3E238A577218"/>
may be enabl'd to continue it or reject it as it agrees with, or deviates from the firſt Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>Now the Church however harraſſed and diſquieted, with a great variety of Diſputes and Debates, about points of <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline;</hi> yet heard little or no noiſe made, for above 1400 years, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>this</hi> point of <hi>Church-Government.</hi> One <hi>Aerius</hi> ſtarted a debate, but had ſo few to ſecond him that it died with himſelf, and left his name on record among <hi>Hereticks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The goodly Order and <hi>Government</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Chriſt, ſtood firm for many Ages; and under it the Church flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the Chriſtian Religion mightily prevailed, notwithſtanding the violent Perſecutions of <hi>thoſe</hi> times: But at length it was invaded, and ſuppreſſed by the Uſurpation and Tyranny of the <hi>Romans Papacy.</hi> A <hi>ſecular Power,</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> was ſet up; and the <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip,</hi> and <hi>Diſcipline</hi> of the Church, following the fate of its Government, were corrupted. Error, Superſtition, Idolatry and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the Pillars of the Papal Kingdom, were introduced: And all maintained, on the one hand, by a moſt falſe and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Pretenſion to an Abſolute infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Power and Authority derived from Chriſt; and on the other, by a moſt horrid and cruel Perſecution of all who
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002417_0009_0FDB3E25004215F8"/>
did but matter the leaſt Diſſent.</p>
            <p>Thus lay the Church for ſome Ages, groaning under this <hi>Anti-chriſtian Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> ſtruggling and wreſtling even unto Blood and Martyrdom, to recover its primitive Purity and Liberty. It pleaſed the Lord at length, to deliver it in part, and to retrieve its <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> by a longwiſh'd for Reformation: A Reformation which had been much more happy and compleat, had not the <hi>Adverſary</hi> ſcattered his Tares among the good Seed which ſprung up in Briars and Thorns: Had not ſome Doctrines and Cuſtoms, maintained by one part of the Reformed Church, and rejected by an other, occaſioned not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes, which gave no leſs diſturbance to the Church, than they yielded Pleaſure and Diverſion to the <hi>Common Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among other differences this was one; that while the greateſt and moſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of the Reformed Church, retained the Ancient Order and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and vindicated it from the Uſurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Encroachments of the <hi>Papacy,</hi>

Churches:</hi> But this did not prevent Diſputes upon that Head, and every Church defending its own Model, as moſt agreeable to the firſt Inſtitution, the debate came to that height, as to occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſad Rupture and Schiſm; a Schiſm which has produc'd no where more wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects, than in theſe three Kingdoms: What Alienation of Minds among profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of the ſame <hi>Reformed Religion,</hi> what Confuſions and barbarous Cruelties, what Convulſions and Revolutions in Church and State, what publick and private Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs, have ſprung from this Root of Bitterneſs, the Hiſtories of the paſt Age, give a very ſad and lamentable Account: And above all, the malignant Influence it hath had on Religion, to obſtruct the Life and Practice of true Chriſtianity, cannot be ſufficiently <hi>regretted.</hi>

            <p>I doubt not but the <hi>Common Enemy,</hi> and they whoſe trade it is to fiſh in muddy Waters, have been very active to <hi>blow this Coal;</hi> but that which hath ſometimes made this Debate break forth in <hi>Veſuvian Flames,</hi> and be diſputed with Fire and Sword, with Blood and Wounds, is, That it hath been incorporated into, and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with other Political Debates and State-differences; It were eaſie to demonſtrate this, did not the evidence of it render it needleſs; that <hi>Political Intereſts</hi> and <hi>State-differences,</hi>

have all along been interwoven with this conteſt about <hi>Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and have ſupported and maintained it: And perhaps at the Bottom, 'tis none of the leaſt prejudices againſt <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> that they of that Perſwaſion have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally aſſerted the <hi>juſt Rights</hi> and <hi>Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Princes,</hi> as the ſureſt Foundation of a Kingdoms Happineſs and Tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; and accordingly have maintained the Doctrines of <hi>Non-reſiſtance,</hi> and <hi>Paſſive Obedience,</hi> &amp;c. whereas its Rival <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> hath been thought by ſome, more ſerviceable for Checking and Curbing the <hi>Power of Princes.</hi> Certain it is, there is <hi>too</hi> much of a Carnal and worldly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that keeps this Debate ſo long alive; and there is little hopes it will die,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.3.</note> till Chriſtians be more animated with the true Spirit and Temper of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>I am ſenſible there have been many Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes which have appear'd in the World upon this Argument, which may ſeem, or be expected to have exhauſted the Subject on both ſides; and this may be a prejudice againſt my preſent undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as ſuperfluous: And the little good effect thoſe Volumes have had, may make it be look'd upon as Preſumption in me to fancy that what I have to offer will do any good, where ſo little has been effected by thoſe that have gone before me.

            <p>Here we ſee, in what a ſolemn man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, Chriſt inſtituted the firſt and prime Officers of his Church, who are particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly deſcribed by their Number, Names, and that honourable Deſignation by which he called them: Whom he alſo named Apoſtles.</p>
            <p>Indeed all the difference expreſſed in theſe two <hi>Miſſions,</hi> is, that we read not of ſuch a <hi>ſolemn Inauguration</hi> of the <hi>ſeventy</hi> unto their Office, as of the <hi>twelve;</hi> and that the <hi>Twelve</hi> were particularly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with the Title of <hi>APOSTLES,</hi> even before they were ſent forth (of the importance of which Name, we ſhall af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards enquire); but the <hi>ſeventy,</hi> tho' they were ſent forth immediately by Chriſt, are no where ſo called, but only
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002417_0017_0FDB3E3939375E90"/>
Diſciples. But though their Commiſſion was much the ſame, with what was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> (who had not as yet received their <hi>full Commiſſion</hi>) yet it is moſt certain, that they were two <hi>diſtinct Orders</hi> of Goſpel Miniſters: they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver numbred together, but in two diſtinct <hi>Claſſes.</hi> The Apoſtles are ſtill <hi>twelve</hi> and not <hi>eighty two;</hi> And (which puts it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all queſtion) when a Vacancy falls in the Colledge of <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> by the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacy of <hi>Judas,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 1</note> what a ſolemn Work was there, at the Tranſlation of one from the Number of Diſciples, that he might be reckoned and numbred with the <hi>Eleven,</hi> and ſucceed to <hi>Judas</hi> his Apoſtle-ſhip?</p>
            <p>Thus have we ſeen two Orders of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Miniſters inſtituted by Chriſt himſelf. There is a third Order inſtituted by his Apoſtles, <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Deacons.</hi> The occaſion, deſign, and manner of inſtituting this new Order, we have fully ſet down in the ſixth Chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the holy Apoſtles, from the firſt to the ſeventh <hi>verſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this Inſtitution I ſhall only obſerve, That <hi>it</hi> was made by the <hi>twelve Apoſtles,</hi> to whom the <hi>Government</hi> of the Church was principally committed, and who had Power and Authority to inſtitute new Offices and Officers as the Exigence of the Church ſhould require; That theſe
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002417_0018_0FDB3E3E87016D30"/>
               <hi>Deacons</hi> were appointed and ſet apart to their Office by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> with the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of <hi>Prayer and Impoſition of Hands,</hi> which was uſual in deſigning and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing Perſons to any ſacred Office, in the Goſpel Miniſtry: And further, that theſe <hi>Deacons</hi> thus ſeparated and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were inveſted with ſome ſhare of the <hi>Apoſtolick Office,</hi> particularly of <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Baptizing,</hi> as well as managing the publick Stock of the Church, which they exerted in ſubordination to the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> under their Inſpection and by their Direction; That <hi>Stephen</hi> was a Preacher (and the reſt of them, of whom we have nothing on record, ſave their Names) as well as <hi>Philip,</hi> cannot be doubted. <hi>Stephen</hi> by his Zeal in propagating the Goſpel, became the firſt Martyr; and of <hi>Philip</hi> we expreſly read, that by his Preaching, he converted <hi>Samaria</hi> and initiated the Converts there, into the Chriſtian Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion by <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> Hence we afterwards find him dignified with the honourable Title of <hi>Philip the Evangeliſt,</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Act.</hi> 8. and 21.2.</note> though but one of the Seven.</p>
            <p>This I obſerve to ſhew, the vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt theſe <hi>Goſpel Deacons</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and ordained by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and <hi>thoſe</hi> who are named <hi>Deacons</hi> under the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Model, without any Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Power to Preach or Baptize, that
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002417_0019_0FDB3E3E88F2F460"/>
none may be impoſed upon by the bare Name, to think them to be of <hi>Divine</hi> or <hi>Apoſtolick Inſtitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus much ſhall ſerve to ſhew what I promis'd in the firſt place, what ſacred Offices were inſtituted by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles in the Church.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I now come to what I promis'd in the ſecond place, to make it appear how theſe Offices were diſtinguiſhed; and to demonſtrate an imparity among them.</p>
            <p>Now of the laſt mentioned, there is no debate; all acknowledge that <hi>Deacons</hi> were different from, and inferiour to the two former Offices of Apoſtles, and the Seventy; 'tis of theſe two that ſome are pleaſed to pronounce that they are one and the ſame; whereas what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready obſerved of their Inſtitution, plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhows them to have been diſtinct Offices, and they are every where ſpoken of in Scripture as ſuch: particularly in that enumeration of Goſpel Officers, I <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28. <hi>God hath ſet in his Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſecondarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers: Are all Apoſtles, are all Prophets, are all Teachers?</hi> Though every Apoſtle was a Prophet and Teacher, the Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Order including the Inferiour; yet every Prophet and Teacher, was not an
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002417_0020_0FDB3E3FFA2C41F8"/>
Apoſtle (as for the reſt in that Enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, they are not diſtinct Offices, but various and different Powers and Gifts wherewith the Goſpel Officers were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued.)</p>
            <p>Suppoſing then the <hi>Deacons</hi> inferiour to the Apoſtles and Seventy, the queſtion is concerning the <hi>twelve</hi> who were called <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and the <hi>ſeventy and others of their Order,</hi> who go by the name of Prophets, in a Goſpel Senſe; Miniſters of the Word and Sacraments,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 15.32. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. Ch. 3.5. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.3.</note> ſuch as <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> were; who are alſo called <hi>Prophets, Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> in the 4th Chapter to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> and the 11th <hi>Verſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſay, the queſtion is whether theſe <hi>Prophets, Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> and <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> were of the ſame Office and Order with the <hi>Apoſtles?</hi> Or, whether they were of a <hi>diſtinct Office</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> and inferiour to that of the <hi>Apoſtles?</hi> For clearing this we muſt conſider their <hi>Commiſſions,</hi> and the Exerciſe of their Office conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their Commiſſions.</p>
            <p>And firſt of the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> All that their firſt Commiſſion did bear, was to Preach the Goſpel and to Adminiſter the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Religion; and this was all the exerciſe of their Apoſtolick Office that we read of, during Chriſt's bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence with them, and in this, (as I ſaid)
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002417_0021_0FDB3E439B0A1A98"/>
they differed little from the <hi>ſeventy:</hi> But when Chriſt was to leave the Earth, having finiſhed the Work of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, He enlarged their Commiſſion, and put them in actual exerciſe of their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolick Power and Office.<note place="margin">Matth. 28.17, 18.</note>

            <p>And as their <hi>Office</hi> was high and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, no leſs were the <hi>Gifts</hi> and <hi>Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> by which they were qualified for

it: They had been Eye and Ear Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Chriſt's Life, Doctrine, Miracles; and beſides the benefit of his publick Miniſtry, had enjoyed the Advantage of his private Converſe, and were well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all the Paſſages of his Life, at leaſt from his entring into his <hi>publick Miniſtry,</hi> till the Day of <hi>Aſcenſion:</hi> They were immediately taught and inſtructed by him in all things, pertaining to the Kingdom of GOD: He had opened their Minds to underſtand the Scriptures, and endued them with the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> to guide them into all Truth, ſo that they were infallibly ſecured from Error, in delivering the Doctrines and Principles of Chriſtianity: And to confirm their Doctrine, they were endued with many <hi>Extraordinary Gifts</hi> and <hi>Powers,</hi> to work Miracles, to heal all manner of Diſeaſes, to caſt out Devils, to ſpeak with divers Tongues, to interpret ſtrange Tongues, to foretel things to come, to diſcern Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, to inflict Corporal Puniſhments on Notorious Sinners; and (which was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to them) they had Power to confer theſe <hi>Extraordinary Gifts</hi> upon others.</p>
            <p>Thus have I given you an account of the Commiſſion by which the Apoſtles acted, I come now to conſider the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion given to the other Order of <hi>Church Officers,</hi> inſtituted by Chriſt, the

They received their Commiſſion immediately from Chriſt, as well as the Apoſtles, and were authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed to preach the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> and endued with <hi>Extraordinary Gifts</hi> of working Miracles, healing Diſeaſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and unto them no leſs than unto the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> Chriſt ſaid, <hi>He that heareth you, beareth me,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luke 10.16.</note> 
               <hi>and he that rejecteth you, rejecteth me, and be that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecteth me, rejecteth him that ſent me.</hi> So that in their Meaſure and Proportion, ſo far as their Commiſſion extended, they were Chriſt's <hi>Meſſengers</hi> and <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> alſo, though not in the ſame <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Quality</hi> with the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as we have ſeen in part already.</p>
            <p>Indeed from the Account we have of them and their Miniſtry in the Sacred Hiſtory, we cannot frame a more juſt and true Notion of this <hi>Second Order</hi> of <hi>Church Officers,</hi> than that they were inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted to be <hi>Aſſiſtants</hi> and <hi>Helpers</hi> to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in the Work of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I know nothing which will give us a better Reaſon for this Notion than this Conſideration, that as it was the ſame <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Law-giver,</hi> the ſame <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter-builder,</hi> who had framed the <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Policy</hi> among the <hi>Jews,</hi> under

the <hi>Legal Diſpenſation,</hi> who does Erect this <hi>New Fabrick</hi> of his <hi>Goſpel-Church;</hi> ſo 'tis reaſonable to expect as great a Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry and Proportion between the one and the other, as the Difference of the two <hi>Diſpenſations</hi> will allow: And it is the Opinion of many Ancient and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Divines, That our Bleſſed Lord in many of his <hi>Goſpel Inſtitutions,</hi> had ſome reſpect to the ſtate of things in the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> as might be ſhewed in many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: And particularly will appear in theſe Offices, which he inſtituted in the <hi>Goſpel Church,</hi> not only in making them of a <hi>Superior</hi> and <hi>Inferior Order,</hi> as under the <hi>Moſaick Diſpenſation,</hi> but alſo, as to the Reaſon and Deſign of theſe different Orders; for after <hi>Aaron</hi> and his Sons were inſtalled in the Prieſt's Office, GOD gave unto them the whole Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> to Miniſter unto them, in the Charge of the Tabernacle.<note place="margin">Numb. 3.</note> So alſo, when <hi>Moſes</hi> was vexed with the unto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardlineſs of the People, and complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to GOD of the Weight and Burden of his Charge, and that the Care and Government of ſuch an unruly People was committed to him alone; the Lord orders that <hi>Seventy</hi> Men, of the <hi>Elders</hi> of the People, be choſen and preſented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him at the Door of the Tabernacle,<note place="margin">Numb. 11.</note> and he took of the Spirit that was upon

               <hi>Moſes,</hi> and put it upon them, that they might bear the burden of the People with him, and he might not bear it alone. Now, whether the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> after their firſt Progreſs, returned with any ſuch Complaint of the greatneſs of their Charge, we read not, except it be inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated by St. <hi>Mark,</hi> when he ſays,<note place="margin">Mark 6.13.</note> That after their return, Chriſt called them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to a deſert Place to reſt themſelves a while: However, certain it is, our Bleſſed Lord well knew the greatneſs of their Work, and ſhortly after, inſtituted that other <hi>Order</hi> of Goſpel Miniſters, the <hi>Seventy</hi> to be Aſſiſtants to the Apoſtles; and accordingly we find the Apoſtles frequently making uſe of the Miniſtry and Aſſiſtance of them of that <hi>Second Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> either taking ſome of them along with them in their Travels, to Miniſter unto them in propagating the Goſpel among the <hi>Jews</hi> or Heathens; or elſe fixing them in places where the Goſpel was received, and Churches founded; or elſe in ſending them with Apoſtolick Orders to Churches that were at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: And 'tis probable that according to the different Exerciſes of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, they were deſigned ſometimes <hi>Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts,</hi> when they laboured in converting <hi>Jews,</hi> or Heathens to the Faith; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> when they

            </p>
            <p>From theſe <hi>different Commiſſions</hi> given to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and the <hi>Seventy,</hi> 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that there was a <hi>Diſtinction</hi> betwixt their <hi>Offices,</hi> and that the Apoſtolick Office was Superior to that of the Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which great Truth may alſo farther be ſhown by ſeveral very weighty Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: For although the Apoſtles did manage the Authority we ſuppoſe they had, ſo much with the Spirit of their Lord and Maſter, who, though he was their Lord and Maſter, yet humbled himſelf <hi>to waſh their Feet,</hi>

            <p n="1">1.

               <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> are ſent to <hi>Samaria,</hi> to confirm and ſettle the Church there, and to confer upon them the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> We find that when the Apoſtles went abroad to execute their Commiſſion in <hi>Diſcipling</hi> the World, they were attended by ſome of the Brethren, as their Aſſiſtants and Miniſters: Six attended <hi>Peter</hi> from <hi>Joppa</hi> to <hi>Ceſarea,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 10.13.</note> and from thence to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and to them it was that he gave Orders for Baptizing <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s Family; and them he brings as Witneſſes for his Vindication, when challenged by them of the Circumciſion, for his Converſe with the <hi>Gentiles.

            <p>Thus, I think, I have done with what I propos'd to make appear in the Second Place, having demonſtratively ſhown how the Goſpel-Officers were diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that there was a Diſparity among them.</p>

            <p>And this is the Hinge on which the whole Controverſy in this matter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, yea, all the Authority and Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Chriſt's firſt inſtitution, as to the preſent Church; for if his Inſtitution was Extraordinary and Temporary in any part, it is ſo far as it was of this Nature, no Rule or Standard now: But if the Order he inſtituted was to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual and ſtanding, then it continues Obligatory to the end of the World; and it muſt be to all Chriſtians, what the Pattern in the Mount was to <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> a conſtant Standard by which the Church is to be moulded and framed in all After-Ages: I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore impartially examine into this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>And, 1ſt, it is acknowledged by all, that many of the Gifts and Powers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with both Apoſtles, and other Paſtors were endued, were <hi>Extraordinary</hi> and <hi>Temporary,</hi> being deſigned only, as the Apoſtle ſays of Tongues,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14 22.</note>

Doctrine which they ſaw atteſted by ſuch <hi>Miraculous Operations:</hi> But the Goſpel-Doctrine being once ſufficiently atteſted and confirmed, there was no further need of continuing them, and they have long ſince ceaſed in the Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, 'Tis alſo acknowledged, that ſome things <hi>peculiar</hi> to the firſt <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> were <hi>Extraordinary</hi> and <hi>Temporary,</hi> and expired with their Perſons. Such as, Their hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been eye and ear Witneſſes of Chriſt's Life, Doctrine, Miracles, Sufferings, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection and Aſcenſion. Their having received their Commiſſion immediately from Chriſt. Their being infallible Guides in delivering the Doctrines of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.

<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002417_0040_0FDB3E6EF707CC90"/>
a particular reſpect to the firſt planting of the Goſpel, and the erecting and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting of the Chriſtian Church in the World: which when performed, theſe extraordinary Powers ceaſed: but,</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, Beſides theſe, There was the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Power and Authority of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, which was to ſerve the Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, good Order and Government of the Conſtituted Church in all ſucceeding Ages: Such as, Their power to preach the Goſpel, adminiſter the Sacraments, and perform all the Offices of Religion, common to them with other Paſtors. More particularly, to preſerve the Offices inſtituted by Chriſt in his Church, by ordaining Miniſters of Religion in all the three diſtinct Offices: To Govern the Churches, and ſuperintend both Paſtors and People: To Judge, Correct and Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Miſdemeanors either in the one or other: To ſettle good Conſtitutions agreeable to the Word of God, for the orderly and decent performance of all the Ordinances of Religion, Publick Worſhip and other Affairs of Diſcipline, as the exigence of the Church ſhould require: And finally, By their Authority and Care, to preſerve the Church from the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of Error, Superſtition, Faction, Schiſm, and Prophaneſs, by their right
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002417_0041_0FDB3E70BB371A78"/>
uſe of the Keys and the Power of bind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and looſing committed to them: All which are proper parts of the Apoſtolick Office, always neceſſary for the good of the Church; and no part more neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry than their Authoritative Inſpection, over the ordinary Paſtors, that they be well qualified for the Paſtoral Office be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be admitted thereto, and when admitted, they perform the ſame, with Faithfulneſs and Diligence, with Prudence and Diſcretion, and in Peace and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord with their Brethren. Now, theſe things being premiſed, I come to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Examination of the matter in hand.</p>
            <p>And here I muſt needs confeſs I think there is nothing more evident upon the ſlighteſt Examination than that Chriſt in Inſtituting theſe Orders and Offices, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, that they ſhould be ſtanding and unalterable Conſtitutions in his Church, to continue for its Edification to the end of the World: And of none, is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterableneſs of Inſtitution more evident, than of the Apoſtolick Office, (which ſome contend to be temporary and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.)</p>
            <p>For 1ſt, When Chriſt gave them their full and laſt Commiſſion, He enjoyns them to teach all Nations,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.19.</note> whom they ſhould Diſciple, to obſerve all things
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:002417_0042_0FDB3E724076F138"/>
whatſoever he had <hi>commanded them,</hi> of which the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Offices,</hi> he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, were a part, which accordingly they were to ſettle in all new founded Churches: And then he adds, <hi>Lo I am with you alway to the end of the World:</hi> But how could that be, if their Office was to expire with themſelves? We muſt then underſtand it, as a promiſe, not to them only, but to their <hi>Succeſſors</hi> alſo: not to their <hi>Perſons</hi> only, but to their <hi>Office,</hi> which was to continue to the end of the World, even ſo long as Chriſt was to have a Church upon Earth.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.28.</note>2dly, The Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>God hath ſet ſome in his Church, firſt Apoſtles, ſecondly Prophets, thirdly Teachers</hi> (what follow, are not diſtinct Offices from theſe, but extraordinary Gifts conferred on them.) <hi>God hath ſet,</hi> even He, who ſettled the Ordinances of Heaven, which none can alter, hath fixed theſe different Orders in his Church: or rather, to uſe the Apoſtles Simile, as God hath ſet va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and different Members in the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Body, ſome more excellent and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, yet, all uſeful and neceſſary to the Beauty and Integrity of the whole; he has done the ſame by his Church: So that whoever would deprive the Church of any of theſe Sacred Offices ſet

in it by God, endeavours no leſs than to mutilate and deform it, to pluck out one of its Eyes, or cut off one of its Hands: And how heinous the Guilt muſt be, ſo to treat the Body whereof Chriſt Jeſus is Head, let them conſider who preſume to do it.</p>
            <p>But farther, Thirdly, in the 4th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 4.11, 12, 13.</note> we have an unconteſtible Teſtimony, prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the perpetual continuance of theſe Offices inſtituted by Chriſt, taken from the end and deſign for which they were inſtituted: <hi>He gave ſome Apoſtles, ſome Prophets, ſome Evangeliſts, ſome Paſtors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying the Body of Chriſt, till we all come in the unity of the Faith and of the Knowledge of the Son of GOD unto a perfect Man, unto the Meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Ver. 14.</note> That we henceforth <hi>be no more Children toſſed to and fro, and carried about by every wind of Doctrine, by the ſlight of Men and cunning Craftineſs, whereby they lie in wait to deceive:</hi> Where it is plain, theſe Offices were to continue till the Church ſhould be perfected, fully brought in, and fully advanced, and till it ſhould be beyond all hazard of being ſeduced, that is, <hi>to the end of the World.</hi> We ſee the end
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:002417_0044_0FDB3E7762A27868"/>
for which theſe Offices were Inſtituted, and how long they were to continue, expreſly ſet down.</p>
            <p>If any ſay, That here are more Offices than are pleaded for: The Anſwer is obvious, that theſe different Deſignations do not import different Offices, but dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Exerciſes of the ſame Office: For Inſtance, an Apoſtle, Presbyter or Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, might be a Prophet, Evangeliſt, Doctor or Teacher. If employed in converting Jews or Heathens to the Faith, he did the Work of an Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt, and on this Account <hi>Philip,</hi> one of the ſeven Deacons, is ſo call'd. If in In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing them who were already Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,<note place="margin">Acts 21.8.</note> that was the Work of an <hi>ordinary Paſtor:</hi> If he laboured mainly in explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and confirming the Doctrines of Chriſtanity, he acted the Part of a <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> or <hi>Teacher:</hi> If he further improved theſe Doctrines to Edification, Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Comfort, that was the Work of the <hi>Prophet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.3. Acts 15.32.</note> in the Goſpel Senſe. Thus <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> two Presbyters, are called <hi>Prophets;</hi> ſo that all theſe are reducible to the three Offices, of whoſe Inſtitution we have given a particular Account.</p>
            <p>And now, if theſe different Orders of Goſpel Miniſters inſtituted by Chriſt, were deſigned by him to be perpetual ſtanding Offices in his Church, for its
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:002417_0045_0FDB3E783A666C98"/>
Edification, good Order and Government, <hi>to the end of the World,</hi> as is evident from what hath been ſaid; there muſt of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be a Succeſſion of Perſons, duly called to theſe Offices, according to Chriſt's Inſtitution, that the Offices them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may be capable of continuing ſtanding in the Church.</p>
            <p>And to erect and ſet up a new Office Paramount to theſe inſtituted by Chriſt, ſuch as the <hi>Papacy,</hi> is intolerable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption; for who can have a Power and Authority in the Church above <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> who were Chriſt's immediate De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legates, but Chriſt himſelf?</p>
            <p>And it is no leſs Preſumption to cut off, or abrogate any of theſe Sacred Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices: 'Tis an overturning that Order eſtabliſhed by Chriſt in his Church, and altering and changing his Inſtitution: It is a Sacrilegious Robbing the Church of theſe Miniſters which Chriſt in his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Wiſdom thought neceſſary for her Edification and Perfection. You know what a dreadful Curſe is pronounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, who either add to, or take away from, the Inſtitutions of Jeſus Chriſt in the 18th and 19th Verſes of the 22d Chapter of the <hi>Revelations</hi> of St. <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it be pretended, that now at leaſt, in the preſent State of the Church, both
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:002417_0046_0FDB3E7DD57E26C8"/>
the <hi>Apoſtolick</hi> and <hi>Prophetick Offices,</hi> may be, to as good Purpoſe, and as great Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Church, performed by the <hi>ordinary Paſtors,</hi> acting in <hi>Parity,</hi> and that it is therefore needleſs to keep a diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Offices: This is to pretend to be wiſer than Chriſt: It is to confound and jumble together the different Orders in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by him: It is to ſet up a new Model different from what he not only eſtabliſhed, but alſo appointed to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in his Church to the end of the World; it is to caſhier Chriſt's <hi>prime Officers</hi> and <hi>Repreſentatives,</hi> and the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches <hi>principal Guides:</hi> And to deprive the Church of the Pledges of her Lord's Care and Kindneſs which he gave her, when he Aſcended up unto Heaven.</p>
            <p>If then our Bleſſed Lord's Inſtitution be preſerved, there muſt be <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> as well as <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> who are not diſputed, that is, Succeſſors to them in their Office in the Chriſtian Church: And who are they? Sure, not every <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,</hi> nor yet any number of them, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever moduled into leſſer or larger Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories: I Honour their <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Office,</hi> but would not have them take too much upon them, nor go beyond their Sphere: They are indeed the <hi>Succeſſors</hi> of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty,</hi> if duly admitted to the <hi>Paſtoral Office,</hi> and may well rejoyce in that
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002417_0047_0FDB3E7F2FC03670"/>
honourable Station to which they are advanced in God's Church, if they Walk worthy of it; but let them remember, that the Whole <hi>Seventy</hi> could not fill the Chair of one <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> (for no Man may take this Honour to himſelf, but he that is called of <hi>GOD</hi>) until the Holy Ghoſt did determine the Choice of one to that High Office: I doubt not, but there were upwards of ſeven hundred Eminent Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, and all endued with <hi>Extraordinary Gifts,</hi> in the Days of the Apoſtles: But <hi>were all Apoſtles?</hi> Says St. <hi>Paul,</hi> No, they, were not.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Which brings me to what I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd in the <hi>Fourth</hi> and <hi>Laſt</hi> Place, to ſhew, ſuppoſing theſe Church-Offices to be ſtanding, who ſucceed in them, and rightly execute them to this Day.</p>
            <p>I need but do it of the Succeſſors to the Apoſtles, for when that is done, the other comes in of Courſe.</p>
            <p>And in clearing this Point, I muſt put you in mind of what was obſerved under the foregoing Head, That the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were endued with ſome Powers and Gifts, which had a peculiar Reference to the firſt Planting and Propagating the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and the firſt Gathering and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuting the Chriſtian Church: Theſe were <hi>Extraordinary,</hi> and did expire with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and in theſe they have no Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:002417_0048_0FDB3E82610742E0"/>But the queſtion is concerning the <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Power and Authority</hi> of the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Office, as it was inſtituted and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Chriſt, to be a ſtanding and continuing Office in his Church when conſtituted, to ſerve for the Edification, good Order and Government thereof to all ſucceeding Ages: The Apoſtles were an Order of the Goſpel-Miniſters, Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to Ordinary Paſtors and Teachers, to whom Chriſt in a ſpecial Manner committed the Care and Government of his Church: To diſpenſe the Word and Sacraments, and perform all Offices of Religion: To Ordain Miniſters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion according to his Inſtitution: To Govern and Superintend his Church both Paſtors and People: To Judge, Correct, and Cenſure Miſdemeanors in the one or other: To ſettle good Orders and Conſtitutions for the orderly and decent performance of all Ordinances of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Publick Worſhip, and Exerciſe of Diſcipline, and to preſerve the Church from Corruption of Error, Superſtition, Faction, Schiſm, and all Irregular Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctices. All theſe are proper Parts of the <hi>Apoſtolic Office,</hi> always neceſſary for the good of the Church; and they are alſo the proper Officers of a <hi>Biſhop, Overſeer</hi> or <hi>Superintendent.</hi> So that 'tis very evident, that in this ordinary and continuing Part
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:002417_0049_0FDB3E8379F85CD0"/>
of the Apoſtolick Office, Chriſt hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the ſtanding Office of <hi>Biſhops</hi> in his Church, that is an Order of Goſpel-Miniſters, Superior to Paſtors and Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, to whom he hath committed the Power and Authority above-mentioned.</p>
            <p>That the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were actually <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and their <hi>Apoſtleſhip</hi> a proper <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> as it is expreſly called, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.20. and that they actually exerted an <hi>Epiſcopal Power</hi> and <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> over the Churches, and the ordinary <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers, Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> I have fully ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Second Inquiry. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly we find the Ancients do frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their Writings call the <hi>Apoſtles, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops;</hi> and no leſs frequently do they ſtile the <hi>Biſhops Apoſtles,</hi> as being their Succeſſors in ordinary; by which 'tis evident, they underſtood, that in the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,</hi> the <hi>Epiſcopal Office</hi> was inſtituted, and that in <hi>Biſhops</hi> the <hi>Apoſtolical Office</hi> is continued in the Church: But this is beyond my Province, having confin'd my ſelf in this Inquiry, to what Light the Sacred Records afford.</p>
            <p>And in conſulting them we find it evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were a <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Order</hi> of Goſpel-Miniſters to <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Ordinary Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers:</hi> That to theſe Apoſtles Chriſt Committed the chief Care &amp; Government of his Church, as his ſpecial and immediate Delegates and
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:002417_0050_0FDB3E872620A690"/>
Truſtees: That the <hi>Inferior Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> did always own and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Apoſtles as their Superiors, and did readily receive and obey their Orders: That this <hi>Apoſtolick Order,</hi> Superior to <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> was to continue in the Church: all which we have fully cleared from Scripture in the former En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries. Now, what Order of Goſpel-Miniſters is there, <hi>Superior to Ordinary Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Teachers,</hi> but that of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> in whom the Apoſtolick Order is continued in the Church?</p>
            <p>Either then <hi>Biſhops</hi> muſt be the true Succeſſors of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or elſe they have no Succeſſors at all, and the <hi>Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Order</hi> and <hi>Office</hi> is quite Extinct, and the Church is totally deprived of the prime and chiefeſt Office inſtituted by Chriſt for its Edification, good Order and Government: And finally, There is now no ſuch Order of Men extant in the World, to whom that large and ample Commiſſion which Chriſt gave only to his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> does belong: To them it was he gave the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, the Power of Binding and Looſing: Them he ſent as his Legates and Ambaſſadors to the World, as the Father had ſent him: Them he inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in, and entruſted with the great Affairs of his Kingdom, and to them he
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:002417_0051_0FDB3E88C9017F08"/>
made that encouraging and gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the World.</hi> Now, who can lay Claim to that Commiſſion, or the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe annexed, but the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and their <hi>Succeſſors?</hi> And if they have no Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors now, that they themſelves are Dead, all that Commiſſion falls, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe with it; which is abſurd to think, and 'tis horrid even to conceive what conſequences would follow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is evident alſo from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, That the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> in their own time did confer upon other; the <hi>Apoſtolick Power and Authority;</hi> which they had never done, if they had thought that the Office was confined to their own Perſons, and was to end with their reſpective Lives: They underſtood better the Mind of their Lord and Maſter, and the Importance of his Promiſe, to be with them <hi>to the end of the World.</hi> Hence they rightly conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That they were to commit the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion given to them, unto the Hands of other faithful Perſons, who ſhould in like manner tranſmit it to others in a continual Succeſſion, <hi>to the end of the World.</hi> Accordingly their firſt Work was to chuſe one to ſucceed <hi>Judas;</hi> and by the Direction of God, <hi>Matthias</hi> is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into the number of the Apoſtles: So when <hi>James,</hi> the Brother of <hi>John,</hi> is

            <p>Theſe are ſuch evident Proofs of an <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> or <hi>Epiſcopal Power</hi> conferred upon one <hi>Paſtor</hi> over other <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>Teachers,</hi> as ought in Reaſon to ſatisfie all Men who are not immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced againſt the <hi>Epiſcopal Order.</hi> I will not contend, but that in the <hi>Exerciſe of this Power,</hi> they may have taken the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Concurrence of the Faithful <hi>Paſtors</hi> in theſe Churches, and concerted Affairs with them: and not done things in an Arbitrary and deſpotick manner, as <hi>Calvin</hi> obſerves; Yet he allows they
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:002417_0055_0FDB3E93584954B8"/>
had ſuch a <hi>Preſidency</hi> over the <hi>Paſtors,</hi>

            <p>If it be ſaid, That <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> acted only as <hi>Paul</hi>'s Delegates, it weakens not the Argument, but rather corroborates it, for it ſtill holds that there was in the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> a <hi>Superior Power and Office,</hi> above that of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> which might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon and committed to another, whether by Delegation, or by Inveſtiture and Ordination of the Perſon into the Office, to which that <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> belonged, comes all to one. It is to as little purpoſe to ſay, that <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> exerciſed this Power and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over the Paſtors of <hi>Epheſus</hi> and <hi>Crete,</hi> as <hi>Evangeliſts:</hi> for 1. If the <hi>Power</hi> was really <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopal,</hi> 'tis all one under whatever deſignation they exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it; But 2dly, 'Tis altogether ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; for we find no ſuch Office of an <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> inſtituted, diſtinct from that of <hi>Apoſtle, Presbyter,</hi> or <hi>Deacon,</hi> but that it was a common deſignation to all who were the firſt Planters of the Goſpel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>Jews,</hi> or <hi>Heathens,</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hold in the preſent caſe, for their Commiſſion is not only to the unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Heathens at <hi>Epheſus</hi> or <hi>Crete,</hi> but to the Churches already ſettled, and Paſtors inſtituted, in the actual Exerciſe of their
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:002417_0056_0FDB3E94C3C20170"/>
Miniſtry in theſe places over whom they are charged to exerciſe this <hi>Epiſcopal Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> as they will anſwer to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Supreme <hi>Lord</hi> of his <hi>Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And what hath been hitherto obſerved, makes it to me, very evident, and I think may make it to any other unprejudic'd Perſon at leaſt highly probable, That the <hi>Angels</hi> of the <hi>Seven Churches</hi> of the leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> were Perſons of the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> and <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Order: For ſince there was ſuch an Office of <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi> inſtituted by Chriſt in his Church, whoſe Office was to Superintend Churches and the Paſtors thereof, and by their Authority to ſettle good Order, to prevent and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect Abuſes and Corruptions in <hi>Paſtors</hi> and <hi>People:</hi> Who elſe could theſe <hi>Angels</hi> be, but Officers of this higher Order? Who therefore are accountable for, and charged Particularly with, any Diſorder or Corruption tolerated in their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Churches: And commended for ſuppreſſing and correcting theſe Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and Purging their Churches of Heretical Teachers.</p>
            <p>And, Finally, we cannot entertain the leaſt Doubt of it in our Minds, but that the <hi>Holy Apoſtles,</hi> to whom our Lord gave ſpecial Commiſſion and Power, to Plant and Settle, and Govern his Church in his Name, would be moſt faithful and exact,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:002417_0057_0FDB3E998EF82B28"/>
in ſettling that Order, and Inſtituting theſe Offices, in all fully conſtituted Churches, which their Lord had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and would be careful to leave the Church at their Death, under the ſame Order and Government, furniſhed with the ſame Offices and Miniſters which Chriſt himſelf her Lord, had inſtituted and appointed for her Edification.</p>
            <p>Neither can it be conceiv'd, that any. Chriſtian Church could look on herſelf as rightly Conſtituted, if any of theſe ſacred Offices inſtituted by Chriſt and his Apoſtles had been wanting.</p>
            <p>And now, having plainly from uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtible Matters of Fact, Recorded in the New Teſtament, repreſented the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> the different Offices and Powers inſtituted by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> in the firſt modeling of the Chriſtian Church; I might add for Confirmation of all that has been hitherto alledg'd, that all the Records we have of the <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Primitive Church</hi> do harmoniouſly atteſt, That this <hi>Order,</hi> and theſe <hi>Offices</hi> inſtituted by Chriſt, were inviolably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for many Ages; and ſo poſitive are they, as to that <hi>prime Office</hi> of <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> that they give us particular Catalogues of the Biſhops who ſucceeded the Apoſtles, in governing the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and principal Churches in the
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:002417_0058_0FDB3E9ACDF8E398"/>
World: But to inſiſt on this, would force me beyond the Bounds within which I propos'd to contain my ſelf in my firſt Entrance upon this Subject.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore only give the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Calvin</hi> in this Matter, becauſe perhaps his Authority may go further with ſome, than that of the Ancients: You will find it in the 1ſt and 4th Sections of the 4th Chapter of his Inſtitutions, where treating of the State of the Church, and the Form of its Government before the Papacy, he ſays to this purpoſe: <q>It will be uſeful in this Matter, to know and conſider the Form of the Ancient Church, which will repreſent before our Eyes, a certain Image of the Divine Inſtitution: Although the Biſhops of thoſe Times, framed many <hi>Canons,</hi> by which they ſeem to ſtrain Things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what is expreſſed in Holy Writ; yet with that Caution did they frame all their Order and Government, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the only Rule of God's Word, that you may eaſily ſee they had almoſt nothing in this Matter diſagreeable to the Word of God. Yea, though ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing might be wanting in their Order, yet, becauſe with a ſincere Study they endeavour'd to preſerve God's Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and erred not much from it, it will be very profitable, briefly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:002417_0059_0FDB12B38E1F8638"/>
what kind of Cuſtom they had. As we have ſhown, there is a threefold Miniſtry commended to us in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; So whatever Miniſters the ancient Church had, it diſtinguiſhed them into three Orders, <hi>Biſhops, Presbyters,</hi> and <hi>Deacons.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And §. 4. <q>That every Province had among their <hi>Biſhops,</hi> one who was an <hi>Arch-biſhop,</hi> and that in the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> Patriarchs were appointed, who in Order and Dignity might be ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to <hi>Arch-biſhops;</hi> This was for Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Diſcipline, that if any thing happened in any Church which could not well be determined by a few, it might be referred to a <hi>Provincial Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,</hi> and if the Affair were of ſuch Importance that it required a greater Diſcuſſion, Application was made to the <hi>Patriarch</hi> with the Synods, from whom there was no Appeal, but to a <hi>General Council:</hi> The Government thus conſtituted, ſome did call an <hi>Hierarchy,</hi> a Name improper (as ſeems to me) ſurely not uſed in Scripture; for the Holy Spirit would provide, that in the Matter of Church-Government, None might Dream of a Principality or Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion; but if laying aſide the Name, we view the Thing it ſelf, we will find that the ancient Biſhops had no mind
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:002417_0060_0FDB3E9E9521E598"/>
to frame any other Form of Church Government, than what was preſcribed by God in his Word.</q> 
               <hi>Thus far</hi> Calvin.</p>
            <p>And I would conclude with theſe Words, but that I am obliged, for further clearing what hath been hitherto obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, to conſider ſome Paſſages of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that are commonly objected againſt what I have advanc'd.</p>
            <p>And, <hi>Firſt,</hi> 'tis alledg'd, that the Names of <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Presbyter</hi> are promiſcuouſly uſed in Scripture, and therefore they ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie but one and the ſame Office: It is Anſwered by ſome, That this is a great Miſtake: And that wherever <hi>Biſhops</hi> are named, we are to underſtand <hi>Biſhops</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſo called, and not <hi>Presbyters,</hi> which they make appear from the Texts brought in favour of the Community of Names; for Inſtance, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.27, 28. They ſay, <hi>Paul</hi> called both <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and that the Clergy of all the Cities thereabout were there; for <hi>Paul,</hi> during his three Years abode in <hi>Aſia,</hi> had Converſed with the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> of other Places, than of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and his appealing to their Knowledge,<note place="margin">Verſe 18.</note> proves that they were preſent, ſo that what he ſays, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. was principally directed to the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and ſecondarily and by way of Reflection to the <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> To <hi>Titus</hi> 1. Ver. 5, 6, 7. it is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:002417_0061_0FDB3EA0037BC8E0"/>
That what is there to be found, only proves that he ſhould Advance the <hi>Presbyters</hi> under him, and Ordain <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and Diſpoſe of them unto Cities, fixing them to certain Cures; ſo it follows, <hi>for a Biſhop muſt be blameleſs,</hi> &amp;c. There were Presbyters before at <hi>Crete,</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> was to ordain ſome of them <hi>Biſhops:</hi> So 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. is to be underſtood of Biſhops <hi>properly ſo called,</hi> that were to be ordained to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide over other Cities, as <hi>Timothy</hi> did over <hi>Epheſus. Phil.</hi> 1.1. may be underſtood of the Biſhops of <hi>Philippi,</hi> and other neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Cities, who were wont to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene and meet together; or it may mean that <hi>Paul,</hi> and the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> that were with him, Salute the Saints at <hi>Philippi.</hi> This Anſwer however not obvious to every one, yet clearly ſhews how uncertain that alledged Identity of Names is.</p>
            <p>But though we ſhould not look upon this Anſwer as abſolutely concluſive, but grant an Identity of Names; yet it will not follow, that there was an Identity of Offices; for Names are common in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, where Offices are acknowledged to be diſtinct. Thus <hi>Hebrews</hi> the 3d and the 1ſt, Chriſt is called an <hi>Apoſtle;</hi> and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.25. he is called a <hi>Biſhop;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.1. John, Ep. 2.3. 1 Cor. 3.5. 2 Cor. 3.6. Col. 4.7, 17.</note> 
               <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> call themſelves <hi>Presbyters;</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Paſtors</hi> are frequently called
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:002417_0062_0FDB3EA19AC93168"/>
               <hi>Deacons.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Theſ. 3.2.</note> Now it cannot from thence be argued, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> Office was one and the ſame with the <hi>Deacons:</hi> The Name of the <hi>Genus</hi> is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally given to the <hi>Species:</hi> The Superior Office including the Inferior, all <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons,</hi> though not <hi>vice versa:</hi> Therefore the Identity of Offices is not to be argued from the Iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Names: for according to the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians themſelves, the Name <hi>Presbyter</hi> is common to the Paſtor, and Ruling Elder, yet the Offices are vaſtly diſtinct.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> ſeveral Texts are addu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, in which 'tis alledged, That <hi>Parity</hi> among Church-Offices is <hi>peremtorily</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; ſuch as Matth. 20.26. <hi>The Lords of the Gentiles,</hi> &amp;c. and the parallel places, <hi>Luke</hi> 9.47, 48. <hi>Luke</hi> 22.24. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.3. To which 'tis anſwered in general, That theſe Scriptures cannot by any juſt Rules of Interpretation be underſtood as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning a Diſparity among Goſpel Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, nor a Superiority of one Order above another; nor a more eminent Power and Authority in ſome to Govern the Church above others; nor all Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction of one Goſpel Office above others, but only that, which is exerciſed with imperious Bitterneſs and Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor are they interpreted to any ſuch purpoſe by any Judicious Perſon of
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:002417_0063_0FDB3EA4A77ACFC0"/>
either Perſwaſion: So that it is not fair, honeſt, or ingenuous Dealing, in any to make uſe of theſe Texts, as condemning <hi>Imparity</hi> among Goſpel Officers, in order to amuſe the <hi>Populace</hi> and Simpler Sort, who are oft-times ſoon taken with the Sound of Words, without conſidering the true Senſe and Importance of them.</p>
            <p>But to anſwer this Objection more particularly, 1ſt, That only is forbidden Goſpel-miniſters, which was practiſed by <hi>the Lords of the Gentiles,</hi> that is, Secular Dominion and Authority; and it was certain, it was this that the Diſciples had in their View, when they contended who ſhould be greateſt; for they were migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily poſſeſſed with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Opinion, that Chriſt's Kingdom was to be a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Kingdom; and it is this miſtake that Chriſt removes.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly, That Dominion which the Lords of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> exerciſed, was not one over another, but over their Subjects, ſo that if it take away all Power of one above another, it will deſtroy the Power of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters over their Flocks: Now, though <hi>Lording over God's Heritage</hi> is expreſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged;<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5.3. Heb. 13.7.17.</note> yet the <hi>Paſtors Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over them,</hi> is expreſly aſſerted, where they are called Rulers, and the People commanded to obey them: It would alſo deſtroy the Power of Synods and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:002417_0064_0FDB12B1D7EB65D8"/>
where Miniſters rule over Miniſters.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly, There are in St. <hi>Luke,</hi> ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, which plainly imply a Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority or Eminency of Power, in ſome over others, when it is ſaid, <hi>He that is greateſt among you:</hi> And when Chriſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes his own Example in what he there enjoyns them, ſaying, <hi>I am among you as one that miniſtreth;</hi> yet none will doubt he was their Lord and Superior, ſo that the command of Miniſtring takes not away the Superiority and Power.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly, It cannot be thought that our Saviour condemned a Diſparity among Goſpel Miniſters, when it is ſo evident that he actually inſtituted Miniſters of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>Offices</hi> and <hi>Degrees,</hi> firſt <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> then <hi>Seventy</hi> others of a Second Order; and his Apoſtles inſtituted a Third Order of <hi>Deacons,</hi> who 'tis certain was Inferior to <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as theſe were to the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5thly, If our Lord had deſigned to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid all <hi>Diſparity</hi> or <hi>Subordination</hi> among the Miniſters of the Goſpel; 'tis like, he would rather have ſtated the Oppoſition between them and the Miniſters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion under the <hi>Moſaick</hi> Diſpenſation, and not the Lords of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> whereas that Paſſage in the 1ſt of <hi>Timothy,</hi> the 4th Chapter, and 14th Verſe, is brought to prove, That Presbyters have a Right or Power to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:002417_0065_0FDB3EA9E7697270"/>
Presbyters, and other Goſpel Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: It is anſwered, That place proves no ſuch Thing. For S. <hi>Jerome,</hi> a zealous Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerter of the Rights of Presbyters, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that Ordination belongs, if not <hi>ſolely,</hi> yet <hi>chiefly</hi> to Biſhops. And both Ancients and Modern, and among theſe, <hi>Calvin,</hi> underſtand Presbyter in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Place, not of the <hi>Conſeſſus</hi> or <hi>Collegium Presbyterorum,</hi> the Aſſembly or Conſiſtory of Presbyters; but of the <hi>Munus</hi> or <hi>Office it ſelf,</hi> or the Ordination of the Office of a Presbyter; ſo that the Laying on of the Hands of the Presbyter ſignifies no more than when he was ordained a Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter; as if St. <hi>Paul</hi> had ſaid, Take heed that the Grace conferred on thee, when I ordained thee a Presbyter,<note place="margin">Calv. Inſtit. Lib. 4. Cap. Sect. 16. ad finem.</note> be not in vain: Thus <hi>Calvin</hi> interprets that place; and what confirms this Gloſs, is the <hi>Kariſma,</hi> or <hi>Gift</hi> ſpoken of, ſeems to have reſpect to theſe extraordinary Gifts conferred by the <hi>Laying on of the Hands of the Apoſtles</hi> in the Ordination of Paſtors, to which the Aſſiſtance and Concurrence of others was not neceſſary.</p>
            <p>But granting that <hi>Presbytery</hi> is to be underſtood of the meeting of Presbyters, yet it will not prove that they had full Power and Authority to Ordain; for here, at the moſt they did but concur and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in the Ordination of <hi>Timothy,</hi> as is
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:002417_0066_0FDB3EAB486D8FF0"/>
evident from 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6. where the Apoſtle calling him to ſtir up that Gift, ſays, that it was conferred on him <hi>by laying on of Hands.</hi> Certain it is, that Apoſtles did Ordain without the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of Presbyters; but I read not that ever Presbyters ordain'd without an Apoſtle or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop; and in an Action of that Nature and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, it may at leaſt be a juſt ground of Doubt and Scruple, that there is no Warrant or Precedent to be found for it in Scripture, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which I know not how any can be fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded in his own mind. How far an abſolute neceſſity may alter the caſe according to the common Axiom, <hi>That many things may be lawful for a Senate when they have no King, that are not when there is one,</hi> I ſhall not determine.</p>

            <p>AND now having finiſhed what I deſign'd at preſent, that is, having demonſtrated from the Scripture's Account of theſe Matters, what was at firſt ſettled in it, and having thence deduc'd what is at preſent the true Form of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the Church of Chriſt: I ſhall only add, by way of <hi>Concluſion,</hi> a ſhort Expoſtulation, in the Spirit of Meekneſs and Love; and calmly enquire, What is the Ground of all that Noiſe and Clamour, Hatred and Prejudice, raiſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them who are of the Principles, as to the Point of Church Government, which are here aſſerted?</p>

Head, King, and Lawgiver to his Church, who hath Power and Authority to ſettle and eſtabliſh Order and Government therein, and to inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute and appoint what Offices, and in what manner he pleaſes, in his Spiritual Kingdom.</p>
            <p>We are fully perſwaded, that He, who is of Infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs, hath diſpoſed all Affairs relating to the Government of his Church, in the moſt excellent method, in the way and manner that tends moſt for the Peace and Unity, Order and Security, Edification and Salvation of his Church and People.</p>
            <p>We find, plainly and expreſly, Three diſtinct Offices inſtituted by Chriſt and his Apoſtles; one Prime and Chief, the <hi>Twelve Apoſtles;</hi> and two Subordinate, the <hi>Seventy Diſciples,</hi> and Seven <hi>Deacons:</hi> Theſe Three Orders of Goſpel-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are unqueſtionably of <hi>Divine Inſtitution</hi> and Appointment. And we cannot find in all the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> that any of them was <hi>Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> and <hi>Temporary;</hi> no, not the leaſt Inſinuation to move us to think, that after a ſhort time any of them was to ceaſe. On the contrary, we have the ſame Evidence for their perpetual Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that we have for their firſt Inſtitution.</p>
            <p>And now let any impartially Judge, who do moſt truly aſſert Chriſt's Kingly Office, and the Prerogatives of his Crown? They who plead for his Inſtitution, and cloſely adhere thereunto, and to the Offices which he hath appointed in his Church; or they, who make bold with his Inſtitution; to abrogate the <hi>prime Office</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:002417_0068_0FDB3EB079C67F30"/>
as how long ſince antiquated and out of uſe; and that only upon a falſe and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Suppoſition, that it was <hi>Extraordinary</hi> and <hi>Temporary.</hi> The falſeneſs of which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewed under my Third Head, and ſhall now repreſent briefly of what a dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence it is to Religion, to alledge that any of the Offices inſtituted by Chriſt, were <hi>Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary</hi> and <hi>Temporary,</hi> appointed only to ſerve the <hi>Infancy</hi> and <hi>Firſt Conſtitution</hi> of the Church, but not to continue in it when once conſtituted. This makes the Rule and Standard of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion uncertain and unfixed, and opens a Gap to all Errors: At this rate, and upon the ſame pretence, <hi>Quakers,</hi> and others, caſt off the Goſpel Inſtitutions, of <hi>Holy Orders, Baptiſm</hi> and <hi>the Lords Supper,</hi> &amp;c. for, ſay they, theſe were only <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Ordinances;</hi> but now all the <hi>Lord's People are Holy,</hi> they are all Prophets, the Manifeſtation of the Spirit, which is given unto all, hath out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated all theſe <hi>Rudimentary Elements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any, thus principled, could but gain ſuch an aſcendant over the <hi>Populace,</hi> as to inſpire them with this Notion, and thereby influence them as much againſt the Order of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> as they have been againſt that of <hi>Biſhops;</hi> What ſhould then become of Order in the Church, or any Goſpel Ordinance? God forbid! That any ſuch wild Caprice ſhould ever ſeize on Chriſtian People; but I make the Suppoſition to repreſent thereby the dangerous Conſequence of that Principle, <hi>That ſome of Chriſt's Inſtitutions were but Temporary:</hi> For it may be improved as much, and on as good

ground, againſt the Office of a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> yea, againſt the poſitive Inſtructions of the Goſpel, as againſt the Office of a <hi>Biſhop;</hi> and there may come ſuch an unhappy Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, when one as well as another, and all as well as one, may thus come to be thought unneceſſary. For alas, if the Truth may be told, 'tis greatly to be feared, that not only the Office of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> but of all <hi>Paſtors,</hi> yea, all the <hi>Sacred Inſtitutions of Chriſt,</hi> are become intolerable unto too many <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, who want but a favourable Opportunity to vent their minds, and ſay, <hi>Come, let us break their Bonds aſunder, and caſt away their Cords</hi> from us.</p>
            <p>How will they be able to anſwer God, or their own Conſciences for it? Who have ſolemnly combined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ruin and overthrow that Order, ſettled by Chriſt in his Church, and have left no Stone unturned, in their reſtleſs Endeavours, to bring the Sacred Offices of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>Paſtors</hi> Miniſtring under their Inſpection and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, into perpetual Contempts; and having induſtriouſly ſet themſelves to oppoſe and fruſtrate all their Goſpel Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations; and not only to alienate the Minds of poor ſimple People from their <hi>Lawful Governours</hi> and <hi>Paſtors,</hi> but with Noiſe and Clamour, and bitter Invectives, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire them with the higheſt Rage and Fury to commit the moſt horrid Outrages on their Sacred Perſons, as good Service done to God; and all upon no other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, but their firm adherence unto the Inſtitution of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Father forgive them, they know not what they do: Lord lay not this Sin to their change, but mercifully open their eyes, that they may ſee the evil of their ways, and may be converted to the Way of Truth and Godlineſs, Peace and Charity, Unity and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and Eternall, Saved: Through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Now unto GOD the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, be Glory Everlaſting. <hi>Amen.</hi>
