            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THE great object of education, in general, is to unfold, direct and engage, the various faculties of the understanding; and when these views are obtained, the Tutors of Youth, may, without blame, rest satisfied. Not so, however, their parents, their present friends, or their future connections. Talents, science and erudition, however brilliant, important or lucrative, must still, to those with whom we live and associate, be but secondary considerations. The comforts of life cannot spring from these sources, though they consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute its refinements; they will not make the character endearing, though they may render it illustrious.—Domestic happiness has its basis in the temper, and every social virtue its origin in the heart. To form or improve these, in the earlier stages of reflection and observation, is the intention and design of every part of this instructive and pleasing work.</hi>

            <head>VISIT FOR A WEEK.</head>
            <p>CLARA and William were the ſon and daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Clement: Clara, who was her mother's darling, had ſcarcely attained her tenth year, when ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced to the card table, and to every place of faſhionable reſort, at which it was poſſible to intrude a child of her age: In conſequence, ſhe grew confident and vain; pretended to give her opinion on every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; and was conſidered by all as a pert, conceited, diſagreeable child: Some pitied—others laughed at her folly—but Mrs. Clement being generally known to poſſeſs that miſtaken ſort of partiality, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her blind to the imperfections of her children, no one ventured to reprove, or point them out. The time thus allotted to pleaſure, little remained for ſtudy; that little was divided between dancing and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, while the knowledge of her own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, French, Geography, and other eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential branches of education, where little attended to, if not wholly neglected. A
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:030966_0005_0FEA0C41E19E23E0"/>
courſe of life ſo improper for her age, na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally brought along with it other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies; her conſtitution ſuffered; the roſes fled her cheeks, and Mrs. Clement too late diſcovered the ill conſequence of her imprudence; ſhe wiſhed to correct the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors ſhe had committed in her education; but found it difficult to aboliſh a ſyſtem ſhe had ſo long countenanced. How far her endeavours had ſucceeded is uncertain, as ſhe was unexpectedly ſeized with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of which ſhe died in a few weeks.</p>
            <p>Clara was at firſt inconſolable, but a ſhort time diſſipated her grief, and her reliſh for pleaſure returned: ſhe was then continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teizing her father to take her to the play—to let her go to Miſs ſuch a one's ball—and the more her wiſhes were gratified the more unreaſonable they grew. Mr. Clement in vain expoſtulated, it was all to no purpoſe; Clara thought only of conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her own inclinations, and Mr. Clement had too long accuſtomed himſelf to yield to them.</p>
            <p>The Mid-ſummer holidays, at length, brought William, who had for three years paſt, been fixed at a boarding-ſchool ſome miles diſtant, home, for the vacation. He was a ſprightly good natured boy, two years younger than his ſiſter, who had juſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her fourteenth. Till his departure for
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:030966_0006_0FEA0C44C97D5240"/>
ſchool, like her, he had been much indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his education neglected, but ſince that time he had been kept to his ſtudies, and his improvements had equalled, if not ſurpaſſed the expectations of his friends.</p>
            <p>Abſence and the loſs they had mutually ſuſtained in their mother, increaſed the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection Clara and her brother, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding they ſometimes differed when to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, entertained for each other; nothing therefore could be more grateful to either than this meeting.</p>
            <p>William had been at home three days, when Mr. Clement one morning told them with a ſmile, they judged the prelude to ſomething agreeable, that they had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion in contemplation, which he doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not would give them pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Clara eagerly enquired to what place? but her countenance, which had the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before been enlivened with ſmiles, was inſtantly clouded, when Mr. Clement replied—To her aunt Mills', in Glouceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. This lady was the widow of an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer: Upon the death of her huſband, with whom ſhe ſeemed to have buried all earthly happineſs, but that which aroſe from retirement and the practice of virtue, had withdrawn to the family manſion-houſe, where, ſecluded from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of life, ſhe paſſed her time in acts of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:030966_0007_0FEA0C466F92FC50"/>
and devotion, and, excepting the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſits ſhe occaſionally paid to a few neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring families, enjoyed a ſolitude almoſt perpetual. The different taſtes and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits of this lady and Mrs. Clement, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſome ſlight miſunderſtandings, had for ſome years diſunited the families; but a few months before the death of Mrs. Clement the intimacy had been renewed. Clara and William had not, however, yet been introduced to their aunt, of whoſe character, from her attachment to retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they had formed no very favourble idea: the viſit was in conſequence not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to either.</p>
            <p>Mr. Clement obſerved it, but without ſeeming to do ſo, continued: "I have for ſome time paſt wiſhed to introduce you to my ſiſter; buſineſs opportunately now calls me into Worceſterſhire; I ſhall therefore drop you in my way, and call for you on my return."</p>
            <p>Clara looked diſconcerted, and enquired with earneſtneſs, "how long they were to ſtay?"</p>
            <p>"My buſineſs will detain me," ſaid Mr. Clement, "about a week."</p>
            <p>"A week!" interrupted Clara, "are we to ſtay a week?"</p>
            <p>"If I may judge by your countenance and manners, Clara," ſaid Mr. Clement,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:030966_0008_0FEA0C49C1B23C10"/>
"the viſit I purpoſe does not meet your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; is a week ſo long a time to paſs with an amiable woman and your father's ſiſter?"</p>
            <p>"But papa, it will be ſo dull; I have heard you ſay that my aunt keeps no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and you know my brother ſhould have a little pleaſure in the holidays."</p>
            <p>William echoed the ſentiments of his ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and joined in entreating his father to defer the viſit, and let them continue in town during his abſence. All, however would not do; Mr. Clement, contrary to his uſual cuſtom, withſtood the ſolicitations of his children, and notwithſtanding all they could ſay, remained inflexible.</p>
            <p>"And when are we to go," aſked Clara, peeviſhly?</p>
            <p>"I deſign to ſet out to-morrow morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing," ſaid Mr. Clement; "and expect that you will both attend me with cheerful coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances."</p>
            <p>Clara finding it in vain to argue the point, was ſilent; but it was evident from her countenance, that this acquieſcence with her father's commands was leſs agreeable to her, than as a dutiful child, it ought to have been.</p>
            <p>As for William, who had made his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections rather out of compliment to his ſiſter, than from any diſlike to the journey,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030966_0009_0FEA0C4D137984F8"/>
he preſently reſumed his cheerfulneſs, but Clara retired in a very ill humour to give orders for the packing her clothes.</p>
            <p>"Pray Miſs," ſaid Betty, underſtanding ſhe was going to viſit her aunt Mills, "how long may you be going to ſtay."</p>
            <p>"Longer than I like, I aſſure you, Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty," ſaid the young lady; "my papa is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined we ſhall ſtay a week."</p>
            <p>"A week Miſs" exclaimed Betty, who ſaw by this, her young miſtreſs was not pleaſed with the journey, "why you will be moped to death; I wonder my maſter can think of taking you to ſuch <hi>an out of the way place!"</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"We ſhall have a melancholy time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed," ſaid Clara, "but there is no ſaying any thing to papa; I never knew him ſo obſtinate in my life."</p>
            <p>"To be ſure," ſaid Betty, "madam Mills is a very charitable good lady; but la miſs, you will be tired to death; they ſay ſhe does nothing from morning till night but read the bible and ſay her prayers."</p>
            <p>"And do you think that is true?" ſaid Clara, in a tone of voice that rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged than checked the impertinence of her ſervant.</p>
            <p>"To be ſure I do," ſaid Betty; "why madam Mills, they ſay, miſs, has never been in London, ſince the death of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:030966_0010_0FEA0C4EC2770AE0"/>
but once, and that was, at your chriſtening; ſo you may be ſure ſhe is an oddity."</p>

            <p>"Well," ſaid Clara; "I ſhall have a charming time of it! but there is no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuading papa; I don't know what's come to him; ſo you muſt pack up my things; let's ſee; I ſhall take my pink luſtering and my blue ſattin ſlip; then there's my ſpotted book muſlin and my fine jaconet with ſprigs; as for the ſtriped muſlin, you will not forget that."</p>

            <p>"I deſire you will put up all that I tell you," ſaid Clara, ſharply; "and don't for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get my cap with the blue and white fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

               <p>Of Mrs. Mills, at which they arrived to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards evening the next day. It was ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate in the moſt fruitful part of the county; on a riſing ground, one ſide of which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a view of diſtant hills and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful encloſures, and the other of a cheerful village, the inhabitants of which looked gay with health and induſtry. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of our travellers was the moſt ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and affectionate; Mrs. Mills embraced her nephew and niece with tears of joy, and gently chid her brother for having ſo long eſtranged her from thoſe in whom her heart was ſo deeply intereſted.</p>
               <p>Clara and William, whoſe faults proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not from a bad or inſenſible heart, but from an erroneous education, were touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with her careſſes, and the more ſo as they could not perceive in her countenance or manners the leaſt trace of that auſterity they had ridiculouſly attached to her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clement, whoſe buſineſs required diſpatch, ſtaid only to take a ſlight refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and again ſet forward on his journey, promiſing to render his abſence as ſhort as poſſible: for Clara, who, however recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled

               <p>Reſt being the moſt deſirable after a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguing journey, the young people were ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conducted to bed, where they ſlept ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly till called upon to riſe the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>William had for ſome time entertained himſelf in the garden when his aunt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the breakfaſt-parlour; but it was not till repeatedly told, Mrs. Mills waited breakfaſt, that Clara was prevailed upon to get up and dreſs; the lady, however, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her with her uſual kindneſs, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily accepting her apologies, they were ſoon ſeated at the breakfaſt table.</p>
               <p>"Do you riſe every morning ſo early, madam?" ſaid Clara, upon her aunt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that ſhe did not appear to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>"Certainly, my dear," replied Mrs. Mills; "one muſt be wholly inſenſible to the beauties of nature, to prefer a ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>activity to the glorious contemplation of it on a fine ſummer's morning.</p>
               <p>"I will anſwer for it," ſaid William, archly, "that my ſiſter, by her own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, would not riſe till ten or eleven o'clock for the fineſt ſight in the world."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:030966_0013_0FEA0C57C5E7C3B8"/>
Clara coloured with vexation, and dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a glance of diſpleaſure at her brother, ſaid, "he need not be ſo ſharp upon her, for it was only ſince he had been at ſchool that he was become ſuch a mighty early riſer.</p>
               <p>William ſeeing his ſiſter's diſpleaſure, ſaid, "he did not mean to offend her," and owned "he had once been as fond of his bed as ſhe," but ſaid "it was now as great a pain to him to lie late, as it had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been to riſe early."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mills obſerved, "that the habit of riſing early was eaſily acquired," and ſaid "ſhe could not think we were authorized by our maker to waſte thoſe precious hours in ſloth, which might be rendered benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to ourſelves, and uſeful to our fellow creatures."</p>
               <p>"But do you not find the day very long, madam? ſaid Clara.</p>
               <p>"Not in the leaſt," returned Mrs. Mills, "on the contrary I often find it too ſhort to fulfil all the duties it neceſſarily brings along with it."</p>
               <p>"Aſtoniſhing!" ſaid Clara; how is it poſſible, madam, that you can employ your time? In London, where there are many things to amuſe one, I am generally tired before night."</p>
               <p>"From this," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "I muſt
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030966_0014_0FEA0C5969906568"/>
judge that our amuſements and purſuits dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer widely; I ſhould aſk my dear girl, in what yours conſiſt? had we time to enter upon the ſubject; but a walk before the day be too far advanced to render it ſultry, will, I think be agreeable."</p>
               <p>The young people replied, "they ſhould like it extremely, and in a few minutes, were ready to attend their good friend."</p>
               <p>The fragance of the breeze, the harmony of the birds, and above all the kind conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion of Mrs. Mills, conſpired to render the walk agreeable, and they continued it on the banks of a winding river, converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on different ſubjects till the attention of Clara, whoſe obſervations did not in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral extend beyond the faſhion of a cap, or the colour of a ribbon, was attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſwarms of young fiſh that appeared in the ſhallow water. "I never, in my life," ſaid ſhe, "ſaw ſuch numbers! look William, they are abſolutely innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable; I ſuppoſe this river is remarkable for fiſh?"</p>
               <p>"Remarkable!" ſaid William, laughing, "why you may ſee as many in every river, if you have a mind to look."</p>
               <p>"I do not believe that," ſaid Clara; "I am ſure I never walked by one where there were ſuch quantities."</p>
               <p>'Your attention, my dear,' ſaid Mrs.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030966_0015_0FEA0C5B284795A0"/>
Mills, "muſt have been directed another way; William is very right, there is nothing ſingular in what you ſee; innumerable as the young fry appear, many rivers produce more abundantly than this."</p>
               <p>"Is it poſſible!" ſaid ſhe, and added, ſtill fixing her eyes upon the water, "what prodigious quantities!"</p>
               <p>"The increaſe is indeed wonderful," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "but what may not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected when a ſingle fiſh is capable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing millions of its ſpecies."</p>
               <p>"Millions!" exclaimed William and his ſiſter at the ſame inſtant, "did you ſay mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions?"</p>
               <p>"I did," replied Mrs. Mills; "the cod produces at a birth, eight or nine millions; the flounder above a million; the mackerel five hundred thouſand; and as for the her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, Mr. Buffon, a great naturaliſt, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes that if a ſingle one was left to multiply undiſturbed for twenty years, it would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a progeny more numerous than the inhabitants of ten ſuch globes, as this we live upon."</p>
               <p>"Amazing" ſaid Clara, "and how many different ſorts of fiſh do you think there are, aunt?"</p>
               <p>"To the beſt of my recollection," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Mrs. Mills, "naturaliſts deſcribe upwards of four hundred, but it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:030966_0016_0FEA0C5F0B116F60"/>
that many more have eſcaped obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation."</p>
               <p>"I wonder for my part," ſaid Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, "they do not ſtop the courſe of the rivers."</p>
               <p>"The greater part," reſumed Mrs. Mills, "are confined to the ſea, and would expire in freſh water; but ſuch is their aſtoniſhing increaſe, that the ocean itſelf would be too limited to contain them, did not the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of one ſpecies depend on the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of another."</p>
               <p>"What, do they eat one another?"</p>
               <p>"Yes;" replied Mrs. Mills, "it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted that ſcarcely one in five thouſand eſcapes the perils of its youth: the young fiſh become the prey of the older, and thoſe that eſcape, in their turn, devour ſuch as are ſmaller than themſelves."</p>
               <p>William was going to reply, but was prevented by his ſiſter, who exclaimed, "what a leap that fiſh gave! I declare, it made me ſtart; did you obſerve, madam, it jumped quite out of the water?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "but i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Is that poſſible?"</p>
               <p>"It is a fact well known," ſaid Mrs.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030966_0017_0FEA0C615DC05158"/>
Mills; "the generality of fiſh, as I before obſerved to you, are confined to the ſea; but a few quit the ſea at certain ſeaſons, to depoſit their ſpawn in the gravelly beds of rivers: of this kind is the ſalmon, which upon theſe occaſions will ſwim up rivers five hundred miles from the ſea, and not only brave various enemies, but ſpring up cataracts and precipices of an amazing height, that interrupt its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs."</p>
               <p>"How ſurpriſing!"</p>
               <p>"And are they as anxious to return to the ſea?" aſked William.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Mrs. Mills, "equally ſo were they confined to the freſh water lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the time nature has appointed for the preſervation of their ſpecies, it is prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by experience, that they become ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, pine away, and expire the ſecond year: the ſalmon, therefore, has no ſooner depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited her eggs, which ſhe does with great care in the gravelly bottom of the river, than ſhe returns to the ſea, if ſhe eſcapes the various ſnares laid for her by the fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermen."</p>
               <p>"Pray, aunt," ſaid William, where is the ſalmon moſtly caught?"</p>
               <p>"We are chiefly," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with this delicious fiſh from the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Tweed and Tyne; from whence it is
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030966_0018_0FEA0C6305B597F8"/>
no uncommon thing for a boat load to be taken at one draught. The trade of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick, a town on the borders of Scotland, and of Colraine, in Ireland, conſiſts wholly in this article. A great quantity of the ſalmon annually caught is conſumed freſh, and the reſt is ſalted or pickled, and ſent beyond ſea."</p>
               <p>"It is a little hard, poor fellows," ſaid Clara, "to be caught after making ſo long a voyage, and encountering ſo many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. How many miles, Madam, did you ſay they will ſwim from the ſea?"</p>
               <p>It is ſaid," replied Mrs. Mills, "they will ſwim up rivers five hundred miles from it; but theſe voyages are nothing, when compared with thoſe made by fiſh of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſcription: What do you think of the <hi>herring,</hi> which viſit us every year from the furtheſt extremity of the North?"</p>
               <p>"Why, do they, aunt?"</p>
               <p>"Innumerable ſhoals of herring," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "live in the ſeas near the North pole, which at certain ſeaſons they quit, and deſcend in multitudes upon our coaſts."</p>
               <p>"They are great travellers indeed," ſaid William. "I am ſtudying geography."</p>
               <p>"The cauſe of their leaving that retreat, where the ſeverity of the climate ſecures them from the attacks of various enemies,

                  </gap>ect-food, with which thoſe ſeas abound, they travel ſouthward in purſuit of a freſh ſupply, which awaits them at the time of their arrival in the Britiſh channel. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be the cauſe, this perilous expedition ſeems to be undertaken with general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and performed with the utmoſt regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity. They aſſemble before they ſet out; ſeparate into diſtinct ſhoals, and during the voyage not a ſtraggler is ſeen from the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral body. In June the main body arrives on our coaſts; and though it has ſuffered much from the greedy inhabitants of the deep, many of which are ſaid to devour barrels at a yawn, is ſo numerous as to alter the very appearance of the ocean, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divided into diſtinct columns, five or ſix miles in length, and three or four broad."</p>
               <p>"They muſt make fine work for fiſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men," ſaid William.</p>
               <p>"The Dutch," replied Mrs. Mills, chiefly monoplize the herring fiſhery: The Engliſh, however, yearly export great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, which are pickled, ſmoaked and ſent to different parts of Europe."</p>

"As Mrs. Mills and her young friends converſed thus, the ſky became ſuddenly overcaſt, and they were glad to take ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from a ſhower, beneath the branches of a ſpreading elm. Clara was extremely diſcompoſed at the thoughts of being wet, and ſaid ſhe was ſure ſhe ſhould get her death of cold, beſide ſpoiling her new bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net the firſt time of putting it on.</p>
               <p>"I hope neither of theſe misfortunes will happen," ſaid Mrs. Mills, with her uſual cheerfulneſs: "This tree will afford us ſhelter for ſome time; and the ſhower is too violent to continue."</p>
               <p>"Ah," ſaid Clara, "it does not look as if it would ceaſe: See it already begins to drip through the tree. Dear, what ſhall we do? I'm ſure I ſhall get my death of cold."</p>
               <p>"Do not alarm yourſelf, my dear," ſaid Mrs. Mills. "When a misfortune can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be avoided, the wiſeſt way is to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to it with patience, and not to make it greater, by the ſuppoſition of evils that may never arrive, or if they do, that you cannot prevent."</p>
               <p>As Mrs. Mills ſaid this, they ſaw a little girl haſtening to them, with a bundle almoſt as big as herſelf. "How do you do, Peg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy?" ſaid Mrs. Mills, when ſhe came up to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:030966_0021_0FEA0C6C3976EC18"/>
The little girl made her beſt courteſy, and untying the bundle, "Pleaſe you, my lady," ſaid ſhe, "I ſaw you under the tree, as I came from ſchool; ſo I made haſte home, and have brought you my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's riding hood." Saying this, Peggy produced a long camblet cloak, with a hood large enough for an umbrella.—"Here is one too," ſaid ſhe, "for young madam; and if maſter would pleaſe to put on this coat.</p>
               <p>"Thank you, my good girl," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "theſe accommodations are very ſeaſonable indeed.</p>
               <p>Peggy then added; "My mother ſends her duty to your ladyſhip, and ſays, if you would pleaſe to ſtep to our cottage, I could go and tell Mr. John to come with the coach: ſhe would have brought the things herſelf, but ſhe has ſcalded her foot."</p>
               <p>"Your mother is very conſiderate," ſaid the lady. "I am ſorry for her accident, and think we cannot do better than accept her invitation, as we are ſo far from home. What ſay you, my dears? Dame Bartlet's cottage is at hand; we can wait there till the ſhower is over, and the wet a little dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off the ground."</p>

               <head>THE COTTAGE,</head>
               <p>where every thing wore the appearance of neatneſs and induſtry. Dame Bartlet, who, upon their entrance, was ſpinning, ſaid, ſhe hoped Mrs. Mills would not take it amiſs that ſhe did not get up to receive her; but that ſhe ſuppoſed Peggy had mentioned her accident, or it muſt ſeem very ſtrange that ſhe did not come in perſon to offer her ſervices.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mills replied, that the attention ſhe had ſhewn was quite ſufficient, and obliged her extremely.</p>
               <p>"Ah! Madam," returned Dame Bartlet, "it would be very ſtrange indeed, if me or my girl were wanting in any duty to a lady who has been ſo good to us."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mills now enquired into the ſtate of Dame Bartlet's foot and recommended the treatment ſhe thought ſalutary, deſiring ſhe would, in the afternoon, ſend Peggy to her for ſome balſam to apply to it. She then made enquiries after ſeveral ſick villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, which, ſhe ſaid, it was her deſign that day to viſit, had not the rain prevented her walk being extended ſo far. Clara, in the mean while, who had never before ſeen a ſpinning wheel, was attentively ſurveying Dame Bartlet's. She admired with what
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030966_0023_0FEA0C6FAE682080"/>
dexterity the good woman drew the thread from the diſtaff, and declared ſhe thought it muſt be a very pretty amuſement.</p>
               <p>"It was once," replied Mrs. Mills, "an employment of repute among perſons of the firſt rank; at preſent it is, in general, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the lower and middling claſs of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for many of whom the diſtaff provides a comfortable ſubſiſtence."</p>
               <p>An hour-glaſs, which ſtood in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, was not leſs the object of William's attention; it was the firſt he had ever ſeen, and, before he enquired, he ventured many conjectures upon what might be its uſe. When Mrs. Mills explained to him in what manner it was calculated to meaſure time, he obſerved, that the people who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it muſt have <hi>very little brains,</hi> for that it was not half ſo convenient as a watch.</p>
               <p>"I agree with you," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "that it is not ſo convenient as a watch; but cannot agree that the firſt inventor of the hour-glaſs diſcovered the leaſt want of ingenuity.—Tell me, William, were you in an iſland where no watch or clock could be procured, what ſhould you think of the hour-glaſs?"</p>
               <p>"I believe, aunt," ſaid William, a little aſhamed of what he had ſaid, "I ſhould think it a great treaſure; for I fancy it
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030966_0024_0FEA0C7433F99290"/>
would be long enough before I ſhould be able to make a watch or a clock."</p>
               <p>"You ſee then," returned Mrs. Mills, "that we muſt not always deſpiſe an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention for its ſimplicity, and that the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of things depend much upon time, place, and circumſtance. It was long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the hour glaſs fell into diſuſe, from the diſcovery of a more convenient mode of meaſuring time. In the firſt ages of Greece, it was cuſtomary for a perſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the office, to aſcend an eminence every day, in the midſt of the city, and proclaim that the ſun had reached the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt point of the heavens; in other words, that it was noon. Sun-dials were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards invented, and in time gave place to ſtill greater improvements. Clocks, though much inferior to thoſe now in uſe, were produced, and in time carried to the perfection you ſo much admire. With reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to our own country; the ingenious art of clock-making was introduced into it, in 1622, by Hugens, a native of Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land."</p>
               <p>At this moment Peggy, who had for ſome time diſappeared, re-entered with a baſket of mulberries ſhe had been gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>"I ſee, Peggy," ſaid Mrs. Mills, as the good girl ſet them before the young people, "that you ſtill love to oblige."</p>
               <p>

Peggy's eyes ſparkled with pleaſure—ſhe bluſhed—courteſied—ſmiled, and ſaid ſhe wiſhed they had ſomething better to offer.</p>
               <p>Clara and her brother, who were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely fond of mulberries, immediately fell to; while Mrs. Mills, obſerving that the rain had ceaſed, ſaid ſhe would ſtep to poor Suſan Millſtone's: "For," ſaid ſhe, "I hear the loſs of her huſband ſets heavy on her."</p>
               <p>"Ay, truly does it," ſaid Dame Bart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let; "ſhe has never held up her head ſince poor Ralph died. It is a pity ſhe takes on ſo—ſhe does nothing but cry—neglects her work; and as to her poor children, they would make your heart ache; ſhe takes no thought of them.</p>
               <p>"This is a ſad account indeed," replied the lady, "I will go and ſee what can be done."</p>
               <p>"Ah! Madam," ſaid Dame Bartlet, "you carry comfort wherever you go."</p>
               <p>During the abſence of Mrs. Mills, Clara and her brother finiſhed the mulberries, and gathered from Dame Bartlet, whoſe grateful heart longed to utter the praiſes of her benefactreſs, that ſhe was indebted to Mrs. Mills for the cottage, with all that it contained, and indeed, ſhe added, for every bleſſing ſhe enjoyed: She was going,

               <p>"May I be ſo bold, Madam," ſaid the good woman, "as to aſk how you found poor Suſan?"</p>
               <p>"I found her, replied Mrs. Mills, "as you deſcribed, buried in grief; but have, I truſt, left her more reconciled to her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes."</p>
               <p>At this inſtant a little girl broke abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the cottage. "O joy, joy, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Bartlet," ſaid ſhe "mammy ſays ſhe will go to work to-morrow, and Madam Mills ſays Jane and I ſhall go to ſchool—and"—The child ſtopt, ſeeing her benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, and drew back confuſed.</p>
               <p>The reader need not be told this was one of the poor woman's children whom the benevolent lady had juſt viſited.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mills, whoſe benevolence was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways performed in ſecret, unwilling the ſubject ſhould be further inveſtigated, ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led affably on the child, and obſerving that the day was far advanced, bade farewel to Peggy and her mother, and haſtily left the cottage, followed by her nephew and niece.</p>
               <p>In the courſe of their walk home, an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion unguardedly eſcaped Clara, which ſtrongly conveyed, that ſhe thought her

aunt condeſcended very much in viſiting and ſpeaking, in ſuch familiar terms, to perſons whoſe ſtation in life was ſo much beneath her own.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mills immediately entered upon this ſubject, and obſerved in reply: That, in the eye of God, we were all equal: "He commands us," ſaid ſhe, to love our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as ourſelves without any previous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, whether he be poor or rich, a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanic or a gentleman."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>"To love our neighbour as ourſelves,"</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Clara pertly: "Do you think there ever was an inſtance of any one loving ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as well as himſelf?"</p>
               <p>"Many," ſaid Mrs. Mills: "Hiſtory abounds with examples that demonſtrate the exiſtence of ſuch virtue. If you are at all acquainted with hiſtory, you cannot forget the friendſhip of Damon and Pythias, nor the noble conduct of Leonidas, and many heroes of antiquity, who devoted themſelves to death for the ſervice of their country."</p>
               <p>Clara, aſhamed to confeſs that ſhe was totally unacquainted with hiſtory, was ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; but William, who was better inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, acknowledged that thoſe heroes might truly be ſaid to love others as well, nay better, than themſelves: but added, it was a long time ſince they lived.</p>

"It is not on that account," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "the leſs true that they did exiſt, and that the events recorded happened; but I could bring many examples from modern hiſtory to prove that it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to love our neighbour as ourſelves, nay, I can cite one, from a people we hold un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civilized, which happened within theſe laſt fifty years.

               <p>"Never," replied Clara.</p>
               <p>"Nor you, William?"</p>
               <p>"Never."</p>
               <p>"Well then," ſaid Mrs. Mills; "ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to yourſelf an immenſe river, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed by a number of lakes or rather ſeas falling perpendicular from a rock one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty-ſeven feet high, and you will form an idea of the cataract of Nia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara"</p>
               <p>"I do think," ſaid William, "I recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Mr. Smyth, our geographical maſter's deſcribing it: is it not in Canada, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of North America?"</p>
               <p>"It is," ſaid Mrs. Mills; "and is eſteemed one of the greateſt curioſities in the world; for two leagues above the great fall, the river is interrupted by a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of leſſer falls, and runs with ſuch ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030966_0029_0FEA0C7F89684F58"/>
that the largeſt canoe would be overturned in an inſtant. Higher up the river is navigable, as you will find by the ſtory I am going to relate.</p>
               <p>"Two Indians went out one day in their canoe, at a ſufficient diſtance from the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taract, to be, as they imagined, out of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; but having drank too frequently of ſome brandy they unfortunately had with them, the fumes of it created a drowſineſs, and they were ſo imprudent as to ſtretch themſelves at the bottom of the canoe, where they fell aſleep.</p>
               <p>"The canoe in the mean time, which they had been towing againſt the ſtream, drove back further and further, and would in a very ſhort time have precipitated them down the fall, had not the noiſe of it, which is heard at the diſtance of ſix, and at certain times, fifteen leagues, awakened them. Figure to yourſelves, my dear chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, what muſt have been the feelings of the poor creatures at this moment; and how dearly they repented the intemperance which had hurried them into ſuch danger, They exclaimed in an agony not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, that they were loſt; but exerted their ſtrength to work the canoe towards an iſland which lies at the brink of the fall. Upon this, exhauſted with labour and fatigue they at length landed; but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030966_0030_0FEA0C828BD2E6B8"/>
reflection were ſenſible that unleſs they could find means to eſcape from this iſland, they had only exchanged one kind of death for another, ſince they muſt unavoidably periſh with hunger; the ſituation of the iſland, however, gave them ſome hopes; the lower end of it touches the precipice from whence the water falls, and divides the cataract in two parts; a ſpace is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently left between, where no water falls, and the rock is ſeen naked. Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity ſupplied them with invention; they formed a ladder of the bark of the linden tree, and faſtening one end of it to a tree that grew at the edge of the precipice, deſcended by it to the water below, into which they threw themſelves, thinking, as it was not rapid in this part, to ſwim to ſhore."</p>
               <p>"Had it been my caſe," ſaid Clara, "I ſhould rather have died of hunger in the iſland, than have attempted my eſcape that way."</p>
               <p>"The Indians," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more wiſely: while hope remains, it is our duty to exert our efforts to avert the misfortune that threatens us, when una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable, it is the higheſt wiſdom to bear it with fortitude and reſignation."</p>
               <p>"And did they reach the ſhore, aunt?" ſaid William.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:030966_0031_0FEA0C852DEB4B78"/>
"No," replied Mrs. Mills; "the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the two cataracts, (for you know I told you one part of the fall was on one ſide of the iſland, and the other on the other) meeting, formed an eddy which, when they began to ſwim, threw them back with violence againſt the rock. They made repeated trials, but with the ſame ill ſucceſs, till at length worn out with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, their bodies much bruiſed, and the ſkin in many parts torn off, from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence with which they were conſtantly thrown againſt the rock, they were forced to climb up the ladder again, into the iſland, from which they now thought nothing but death could deliver them.</p>
               <p>"Their hopes once more revived, when they perceived ſome Indians on the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſhore. By ſigns and cries, they at laſt drew their attention; but ſuch was the perilous ſituation of the iſland, that though they ſaw and pitied them, they gave them ſmall hopes of aſſiſtance. The governor of the fort, however, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with their ſituation, humanely conceived a project for their deliverance. He reflected that the water on the eaſtern ſide of the iſland, notwithſtanding it's ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity, is ſhallow, and thought by the help of long poles pointed with iron, it might be poſſible to walk to the iſland. The
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030966_0032_0FEA0C879F3C71D8"/>
difficulty was to find a perſon with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient courage and generoſity to attempt their reſcue at the hazard of his own life."</p>
               <p>"Indeed," ſaid Clara; "if their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance depended upon that, I ſhould have thought ſmall hope remained of it."</p>
               <p>"It was nevertheleſs effected," ſaid Mrs. Mills; "two generous Indians under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to execute the governor's project, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving to deliver their poor brethren, or to periſh in the attempt."</p>
               <p>"Is it poſſible?" ſaid William; "what noble ſouls!"</p>
               <p>"Yes," ſaid Mrs. Mills; "they prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their perilous expedition, and took leave of all their friends, as if they had been going to death: each was furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with two poles pointed with iron, which they ſet to the bottom of the ſtream, to keep them ſteady and ſupport them againſt the current, which muſt otherwiſe have carried them along with it. In this manner they proceeded, and actually ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the iſland, where, delivering two of the poles to the poor Indians, who had now been nine days upon the iſland, and were almoſt ſtarved to death, they all four returned ſafe to the ſhore they had left."</p>
               <p>"What a providential eſcape!" ſaid
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030966_0033_0FEA0C8A1A6366D0"/>
William; "how rejoiced the poor fellows muſt have been to receive the poles that were to aſſiſt them in getting away!"</p>
               <p>"Their joy," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "on the proſpect of their deliverance, muſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been great, but I will venture to affirm, it did not exceed that, of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Indians, who hazarded their lives to effect it."</p>
               <p>"It muſt certainly," ſaid William, "have given them great pleaſure, but what a riſk they ran!"</p>
               <p>"True" ſaid Mrs. Mills, "but on the other hand, what a gratification! do you think there could be a pleaſure equal to that felt by the generous Indians, when they effected the deliverance of their poor country-men."</p>
               <p>"They were certainly noble creatures," ſaid Clara, "one does not often hear, even in civilized countries, of perſons who act ſo diſintereſtedly."</p>
               <p>"Though inſtances of ſuch generoſity," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "do not occur daily, they are, nevertheleſs, more frequent than we are aware of.</p>
               <p>"Do you think ſo?" ſaid William.</p>
               <p>"Yes;" replied Mrs. Mills, "the moſt generous actions, are performed in ſecret, and ſhun the noiſe of public fame; on this account, it is, that they do not ſo often

               <p>"Dear aunt," ſaid William, and his ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, at the ſame inſtant, "do relate it?"</p>
               <p>"The fact I allude to," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "happened within theſe ſeven or eight years in France, at a place called Noyon. Four men, who were employed in clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a common ſewer, upon opening a drain, were ſo affected by the foetid vapours, that they were unable to return. The lateneſs of the hour (for it was eleven at night) rendered it difficult to procure aſſiſtance, and the delay muſt have been fatal, had not a young girl, a ſervant in the family, with courage and humanity, that would have done honour to the moſt elevated ſtation, at the hazard of her own life, attempted their deliverance.

found her breath failing, and was ſo much affected by the vapour, as to be in danger of ſuffocation. In this dreadful ſituation, ſhe had the preſence of mind to tye herſelf by her hair to the rope, and was drawn up almoſt expiring with the poor man, in whoſe behalf ſhe had ſo humanely exerted herſelf.</p>

               <p>"You are miſtaken," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "far from being intimidated, the moment ſhe recovered her ſpirits, ſhe inſiſted upon being let down for the poor creature that remained, which ſhe actually was; but her exertions at this time failed of ſucceſs; the poor man being drawn up dead."</p>
               <p>"Is this really a true ſtory?" ſaid Clara. "It is an undoubted fact," ſaid Mrs. Mills; "the corporation of the town of Noyon, as a ſmall token of their approbation, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the generous girl with ſix hundred livres, and conferred on her, the civic crown, with a medal, engraven with the arms of the town, her name, and a narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the actions.

"But to return," ſaid Mrs. Mills, to our firſt point: theſe, and many more examples of the ſame kind, that I could prove, that when our bleſſed Lord commands us to love our neighbour as ourſelves, he does not exact that which is beyond the ability of his creatures to perform.</p>
               <p>"Why, to be ſure," ſaid Clara, "both the Indians and the generous girl, you have juſt mentioned, may truly be ſaid to love their neighbour as themſelves; but it is much more eaſy to admire than to imitate."</p>

If ſhe is from ſchool, and unemployed by her mother, the wheel of Dame Grimeſtone, their next neighbour, who has a large family, never ſtood ſtill. If any difference happen among her companions, Peggy is the firſt to ſet on foot a reconciliation; and as for the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Robert Gould, a poor labourer, who lives within a few doors of them, Peggy has already taught two of them to read, and a third nearly to ſay the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phabet.

Before ſhe could finiſh the ſentence, the gate opened, and Clara, upon entering the hall, perceived the hand of the clock upon the ſtroke of three; little time remained for the toilet: ſhe haſtened into her dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing room, and found it was poſſible to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete that which commonly took up two hours, equally as well in twenty minutes.</p>

A man apparently on the point of expiring, deſtitute of every neceſſary comfort, lay on the ground and by him ſat a woman, in the prime of life, whom grief and diſeaſe ſeemed to have reduced nearly to the ſame condition.

                  <p>An expreſſive glance from the poor man told his gratitude, and the woman preſſing the hand of the girl, exclaimed, 'Ah!

               <p>"Do not be uneaſy about that," ſaid the child, 'we ſleep much eaſier upon the rug than we ſhould on the mattreſs, if we knew you wanted one.' Saying this, ſhe threw off her cloak, and taking ſome dry ſticks out of her baſket, ſet them alight in the chimney, and prepared to boil the eggs. The door being half ſhut, I had continued an unſeen ſpectator of all that paſſed; I now thought it time to enter, and gave a ſoft rap.</p>

"I underſtood, in general terms, upon my entrance, that a ſeries of misfortunes had reduced this unhappy pair to their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miſerable condition; but it was not a time to require particulars; their ſituation called for immediate redreſs."</p>
               <p>"And I am ſure aunt," ſaid William, "you did not refuſe it."</p>
               <p>"If I had, William, I muſt have been unworthy the affluence with which Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has bleſſed me," ſaid Mrs. Mills; "but with reſpect to the poor man, aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance came too late; notwithſtanding the humane exertions of Mr. Benſon, our apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, who, at my requeſt, went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, he did not ſurvive till the next morning; and grief increaſed the fever of the woman ſo much, that it was not till ſome days after, Mr. Benſon could give hopes of her recovery. Time and reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, however, compoſed her mind; the fever abated, and ſhe gathered ſtrength daily. As ſhe had been removed to my houſe, I had frequent opportunities of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, and thought I obſerved in her ſomething above the vulgar; not that there was any thing in her deportment unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or inconſiſtent with an humble ſtation; but her ſentiments, though plain and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned, were expreſſed with a propriety ſeldom met with in low life: She appeared to be well acquainted with the Scriptures
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030966_0043_0FEA0CA312E612E0"/>
and with ſeveral books of divinity, and an unaffected ſtrain of piety prevailed in her diſcourſe, that intereſted me very much.</p>

                  <p>On expreſſing, one day, my ſurprize to find her ſo well informed, ſhe replied; 'Ah, Madam! the little I know I owe all to a dear young lady, with whom I was ſo happy as to paſs my youth.</p>
                  <p>I deſired ſhe would be more explicit, and ſhe continued: 'My father was a poor labourer on the eſtate of Sir James Ramſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, whoſe lady, when I was twelve years old, took me into the family to wait upon Miſs Frances, her youngeſt daughter, at that time juſt ſeven years of age. Never ſure was ſeen ſo ſweet a child! At thoſe ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly years ſhe diſcovered a ſenſe of religion, ſeldom met with at a riper age: She would frequently repeat little extempore prayers, and divine ſtanzas, which ſhewed the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly turn of her mind. As ſhe grew up, her ſole delight was in reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and other books of divinity, or in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming acts of charity and devotion, How often, while other young ladies have been engaged at the card table, or places of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic diverſion, has ſhe paſſed her time, in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing me in the word of God, and the duties of my ſtation!

                  <p>I aſſured her that I thought otherwiſe: The moſt trifling incidents, I obſerved, when they related to a character ſo exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary, could not fail of intereſting the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. She then, at my requeſt, acquainted me with what afterwards befel her, and, to the beſt of my remembrance, went on thus:</p>
                  <p>Time, Madam, reconciled me to the loſs of my dear young lady; but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts I had ſo often received from her mouth, and ſeen enforced by her example, as the Pſalmiſt ſays, <hi>"were written on the tablets of my heart,"</hi> and I can with truth ſay, "that I have found them <hi>more precious than gold or fine raiment."</hi> I continued in the family of Lady Ramſden till I married my late huſband, an honeſt induſtrious man, who rented a ſmall farm thirty miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. For the firſt ſix years after our mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, every thing went on well, and we were getting forward in the world apace; but, unfortunately for us, our landlord died
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030966_0045_0FEA0CA7DE78B090"/>
ſuddenly, and the perſon into whoſe hands the farm fell, not only refuſed to renew our leaſe, which was nearly expired, but inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ſuch an enormous advance of rent, that my huſband thought it prudent to quit the farm.</p>
                  <p>We took Harley farm, which you know, Madam, is within a mile of the next village. The rent was higher than that we formerly paid, but my huſband thought, by attention and induſtry, to make it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; and I am ſure, poor ſoul! he did not ſpare that: but indeed, ſaid Mrs. Brown, with tears in her eyes, we ſeemed to have left all our good fortune at the old farm; the ſoil of the new one proved unfruitful, and, in ſpight of all my huſband's labour, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſuch poor crops, that we loſt conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably the two firſt years. We conſoled ourſelves with the hopes that the next would be better (for we had taken a long leaſe of the farm) but we were diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſome ſtables belonging to our next neighbour, unfortunately taking fire, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to our granary, where it did us conſiderable damage before it could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed. Theſe, and other loſſes, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented my huſband's making his regular payments, and preyed ſo much upon his mind, that it greatly affected his health, and a cold, which he caught about this time, falling upon his lungs, laid the
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030966_0046_0FEA0CA9A5653E00"/>
foundation for the diſeaſe that put an end to his life.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, things grew worſe and worſe; we found ourſelves every year more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved; and our arrears with our landlord being conſiderable, he took poſſeſſion of our effects, and we were turned into the world deſtitute. As we had neither money nor friends, we could expect ſupport only from our own labour, and, weak as he was, my huſband determined to ſet out immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately for a farm about four miles off, where he had been told hands were much wanted. In ſhort, Madam, we ſet out, but in the way my poor huſband grew ſo bad, that he could not proceed: he fainted, and when he recovered, I thought it a great bleſſing that the ſhed in which you, Madam, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered us was at hand to receive him. He crawled to it, thinking to ſtay there till his ſtrength returned; but, poor ſoul, he grew worſe and worſe. The little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney we had, which amounted only to a few ſhillings, was ſoon expended: want ſtared us in the face, and I ſet out for the village I had left to ſeek employment. You will wonder, Madam, that I did not ſeek it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſpot; and, I am aſhamed to ſay, that I was with-held by pride. I knew it muſt lead to a diſcovery of our miſerable retreat, which I had hitherto carefully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:030966_0047_0FEA0CAE65B34A78"/>
by going for the few neceſſaries we wanted at night.</p>
                  <p>I had ſcarcely entered the village when I was met by Peggy Bartlet, the little girl whom you condeſcended the other day to notice: ſhe is the daughter of a poor wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, to whom in better days I had render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome little ſervices. The poor child threw her arms round my neck overjoyed, and run to tell her mother, who weeds, ſpins, chares, or any way earns a penny to ſupport herſelf and child, that I was there. The poor woman upbraided me kindly for having left the village, without ſaying where I was going, and ſaid, ſhe had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to leave work that evening earlier than uſual, to find me out, and ſee if ſhe could not do any thing for us.</p>
                  <p>I am aſhamed to ſay, Madam, that my pride was ſo great, that I preferred telling a falſehood to acknowledging the truth of our ſituation to this honeſt creature: I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that my huſband had got into work at Burlington farm, for which we had ſet out, and that being diſengaged, I alſo wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for employment; enquiring if ſhe knew of any?</p>
                  <p>She replied, that hands were wanted in the garden, where ſhe worked; but add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it was not employment for me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="unknown:030966_0048_0FEA0CB0162DEAE0"/>
My neceſſities were too preſſing to heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate; I replied that I ſhould gladly accept the employment, and begged ſhe would apply for me directly.</p>
                  <p>Ah! ſaid the good creature, ſhaking her head, little did I think—and her heart was ſo full, ſhe could ſay no more.</p>
                  <p>I ſaid I had never been accuſtomed to idleneſs, and cheerfully ſubmitted to the will of God.</p>
                  <p>I was immediately ſet to work, and in the evening, with a heart ſomewhat light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, I returned to my huſband with the pittance I had earned. I continued for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days to attend regularly at the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, but the anxiety I felt in leaving my huſband, who every day grew worſe, was ſuch, that it produced a ſlow few, which reduced me ſo much, that it was with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty I purſued my labours. Still, however, I pleaſed myſelf with the thought, that the extent of our miſery was unknown; till re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning one evening ſomething earlier than uſual, I met little Peggy at the entrance of our retreat. The poor girl fell upon her knees, and with tears in her eyes, begged I would not be angry with her. She ſaid, ſhe had remarked how ill, and ſad, I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and was afraid things were worſe than I ſaid, which had made her determine to watch me home. But little did I think, ſaid ſhe, ſobbing, they were ſo bad.</p>

"The grief of the poor child," ſaid Mrs. Brown, "affected me ſo much, that I could not forbear mingling my tears with hers, and for ſome minutes, our hearts were ſo full, that neither of us could ſpeak: at laſt, ſhe broke abruptly from me, and taking the path toward home, I thought of ſeeing her no more that night; but I was miſtaken, about an hour and a half after, a ſoft rap came to the door; I opened it, and was not a little ſurprized to find there Peggy and her mother, each charged with a load they could ſcarcely ſtand under; would you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, Madam, they had brought us their mattreſs and blankets! and actually, till your bounty, made it unneceſſary, lay on the ground themſelves. I begged, and ſo did my poor huſband, that they would take them back, but it was all to no purpoſe: hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven be praiſed, they ſaid, they had found us out, and had a mattreſs and blankets for us. Nor was this all, I ſoon grew ſo ill, that I could not, as uſual, go to work, and then Madam, we muſt have ſtarved, had it not been for theſe good creatures, who, I am certain, often went without neceſſaries themſelves, that they might ſupply us with what they fancied we could eat.</p>
               <p>The good woman herſelf was obliged to keep cloſe to work, but Peggy conſtantly ſlaved to us twice, and ſometimes three
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030966_0050_0FEA0CB37B107008"/>
times a-day. She never came empty-hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; if it were but a few ſticks ſhe had pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up by the way, to make us a little fire, ſhe had always ſomething: and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to alleviate our diſtreſs by a thouſand kind attentions.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, madam," ſaid Mrs. Brown, "had it not been for thoſe good people, we muſt have been loſt for want. I can never forget their kindneſs."</p>
               <p>"This account," continued Mrs. Mills, "raiſed Dame Bartlet and Peggy high in my eſteem: I wiſhed to ſee them, and one day took a ride to the village where they lived. Upon enquiry, I found, as Mrs. Brown had before told me, that dame Bart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let was the widow of a poor weaver; that by dint of hard labour, ſhe ſupported her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and child, and paid for a room, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther garret. I learnt further, that ſhe had not always been accuſtomed to labour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doors; but that two years before, ſhe had the misfortune to be robbed of her ſpinning-wheel, which before ſupported her, and ſince that time, ſhe was glad to weed, chare, or do any thing to earn an honeſt penny. The cottage, which we this morning viſited, happened at that time to be vacant, and I thought it could not be occupied by more worthy inhabitants. I, therefore, aſked dame Bartlet, if ſhe would
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:030966_0051_0FEA0CB75B401AD0"/>
like to remove to it? ſhe was rejoiced at the propoſal, and when, I added, I would furniſh it, and purchaſe a ſpinning-wheel, Peggy and ſhe were nearly out of their wits with joy. I need not tell you, I was as good as my word; a fortnight after, they removed to the cottage, and have ſince oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied it. An opportunity, alſo, ſoon offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of placing Mrs. Brown in a ſtation to which ſhe does great credit; we have a ſchool of induſtry in the village, the miſtreſs of which dying, Mrs. Brown ſupplies her place. Peggy attends the ſchool, and tho' Mrs. Brown is too juſt to let her partiality appear at improper times, I am certain, ſhe entertains the ſame affection for her, as if ſhe were her own child."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mills concluded her narrative, as the ſervant brought in tea. A walk upon the lawn occupied the time, till the bell rung for ſupper, after which, the whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily being aſſembled, the day was as uſual, concluded in prayer and thankſgiving.</p>
               <p>The next morning, Clara roſe at a more early hour, and took care to be ready to receive her aunt in the breakfaſt parlour. Having taken their tea and chocolate, Mrs. Mills acquainted her young friends, that ſhe was going to viſit her bees, and invited them to accompany her. They all three, then took their way to</p>

               <p>at which, they preſently arrived. Among the hives, was one different to the reſt; Clara obſerved it, and enquired the reaſon?</p>
               <p>"That hive, my dear," ſaid Mrs. Mills, was conſtructed by my own directions; you ſee it is chiefly of glaſs: I ſpend many hours in obſerving the little buſy people that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit it."</p>
               <p>"I have been told aunt," ſaid William, "that bees have a queen; is it true?"</p>
               <p>"It is;" ſaid Mrs. Mills, "and what is more, this queen has a palace, guards to attend her, and ſubjects over whom ſhe reigns as abſolute."</p>
               <p>You are jeſting with us, aunt?</p>
               <p>"I am perfectly ſerious," replied Mrs. Mills: "In every ſwarm, there are three ſorts of bees; the working bee, the drone which is ſuppoſed to be the male, and the queen, which is longer and more beautiful than the reſt, and is the mother of the whole ſwarm."</p>
               <p>But you ſaid the queen had a palace.</p>
               <p>She has a cell proportionable to her ſize, raiſed from a large foundation, either on the flat or edge of the comb, and different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly formed from the reſt. This I think, may, with no great impropriety be called her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. She generally keeps herſelf retired in
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:030966_0053_0FEA0CBB77C367E8"/>
the upper apartments of the comb, and whenever ſhe appears in public, which is generally to depoſit her eggs, is attended by ſeveral large bees, if not by the whole ſwarm, who flutter their wings, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear all in tranſport.</p>
               <p>"You were very right indeed aunt, ſaid William, "to ſay that the queen had her palace and her guards; how wonderful!"</p>
               <p>"The attachment of the whole ſwarm to the queen bee," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, wonderful: an author, who has given us many curious particulars concerning theſe inſects, relates, that having once an inclination to prove, how far this ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtinct, would influence them, he took a ſwarm of bees that had been hived the day before, and having ſhook them in a lump, on a graſs plot, ſeperated the queen bee from the reſt, cilpt one of her wings, and kept her in a box apart. A general confuſion immediately took place, contrary to their uſual cuſtom, which is to cluſter together, the bees immediately ſcattered themſelves over the graſs, and flew here and there in purſuit of their queen with a piteous diſcontented noiſe. When the box, in which ſhe was confined, was opened, a different ſcene took place; they immediately gathered together from all parts, and in leſs than a quarter of an hour, the whole ſwarm
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:030966_0054_0FEA0CBD2D4C6F80"/>
cluſtered around it, waiting till the queen, as uſual, ſhould lead them to ſome place for their common preſervation.</p>
               <p>But the poor queen, was unable to riſe; and her faithful ſubjects, choſe rather to die with her, than to deſert her, for tho' pinched with hunger, they would not fly to get any food. Nor was the affection of the queen leſs to her ſubjects: when ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from them, ſhe refuſed the honey that was repeatedly offered her. I am ſure, you will be ſorry to hear, that having continued four days, without taſting any food, they all literally died by famine, except the queen, who lived only a few hours after<note n="*" place="bottom">Wardour on Bees.</note>"</p>
               <p>"Ah!" ſaid William, "how I ſhould have grieved; it was a cruel experiment, but a convincing proof, that animals have reaſon.</p>
               <p>"Hold, my dear William," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "be cautious of falling into ſo groſs an error. Though the order and ſeeming rationally, which is diſcerned in the animal creation, cannot fail of raiſing our ideas of that Being, whoſe wiſdom is diſplayed in the minuteſt of his works, let us not imagine he has beſtowed on them that ſuperior fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty man alone enjoys. The little buſy creatures of whom we ſpeak, however
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:030966_0055_0FEA0CBFCACB2730"/>
wonderful their labours and economy, act by ſtated laws which providence has implanted in their nature: inſenſible of good and evil, they are impelled only to the performance of that which is neceſſary to their preſervation, or the wiſe purpoſes for which they are cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated."</p>
               <p>At this inſtant the attention of William was attracted by a bee returning to the hive, and he exclaimed, "look, aunt at that bee, it is ſo loaded, it can ſcarcely fly."</p>
               <p>"It is indeed well laden," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "but will ſoon be eaſed of its bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; obſerve, William, it is now at the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the hive, and is met by ſeveral bees, who are buſily employed in aſſiſting it to unload."</p>
               <p>"Is that what they are about?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," ſaid Mrs. Mills; "they will ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the little pellets the other has collected, and in their ſtomachs they will acquire the conſiſtence of wax, which will afterward be caſt up and turned over to other bees, whoſe buſineſs it is to knead it, and ſpread it into different ſheets, laid one upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther."</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid Clara, "it is aſtoniſhing! but how do they collect the little pellets?"</p>
               <p>"They collect the yellow duſt of flowers in the hairs of their body? then bruſh themſelves and form the grains into pellets. The honey is collected by a ſort of trunk;
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:030966_0056_0FEA0CC3E3560D10"/>
a ſmall part of it goes to ſupport the bee, and the reſt is preſerved in a little bag, with which nature has furniſhed her ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, to be caſt up and depoſited, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in magazines for the ſupport of the community?"</p>
               <p>"But I cannot conceive, aunt," ſaid Clara, "of what ſervice the wax can be; do they eat it?"</p>
               <p>"With the wax," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "they build their habitations, and ſeal up the honey in their cells; they alſo mix it with honey, to make bee-bread for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of their young."</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid Clara, "I was never more intereſted in my life in any ſtory than in the account you have given us of theſe dear little creatures: If they have not reaſon, I am ſure they have a much larger ſhare of inſtinct than any other creature."</p>
               <p>"They certainly have," ſaid William.</p>
               <p>"A ſufficient portion of this principle," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "is viſible in the meaneſt inſect to raiſe our admiration of the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Being.

               <p>"On what account, my dear," ſaid Mrs. Mills? "Let us take the other path, and talk this matter coolly over. Tell me from what does your averſion to theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive inſects ariſe?"</p>
               <p>"O la! aunt, I can't tell; they are ſuch ugly creatures, the very thought of them makes me ſhudder."</p>
               <p>"But, my dear child, if you have no better reaſon for diſliking them, you muſt allow me to ſay, it is a prejudice which a little reſolution would enable you to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount."</p>
               <p>"O aunt," replied Clara, "it is impoſſible I ſhould ever endure the ſight of a ſpider:
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:030966_0058_0FEA0CC7EFCD78F8"/>
I took a diſlike to them when I was a very little girl; and I am certain, if one was to be put upon me, I ſhould fall into fits."</p>
               <p>"If you think ſo," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "it is your duty to ſurmount a prejudice, acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent might render ſo fatal to you."</p>
               <p>"O dear," ſaid Clara, "it would be in vain for me to try; when people have ſuch an antipathy to a thing, it is impoſſible to overcome it."</p>
               <p>"If I convince you," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "that it is poſſible to overcome ſuch an antipathy, will you promiſe me to uſe your endeavours to get the better of your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to ſpiders?"</p>
               <p>"I have the greateſt opinion of what you ſay, Madam," ſaid Clara, "but I own, I do not think you will ever convince me it is poſſible to overcome a diſlike where it is ſo ſtrong as mine to ſpiders."</p>
               <p>"But, if you <hi>ſhould</hi> be convinced, will you promiſe me to uſe your endeavours?"</p>
               <p>"If you deſire it, Madam."</p>
               <p>"Well then," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "I will recount an anecdote that muſt convince you an antipathy is really to be overcome."</p>
               <p>"O," ſaid William, drawing cloſe to his aunt, "I am glad we are going to have a ſtory: I do ſo love ſtories!"</p>
               <p>"This I am going to relate," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "has the merit of truth: you have,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:030966_0059_0FEA0CCACCED1118"/>
without doubt, heard of Peter the Great, Czar of Muſcovy."</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied William; "he founded the city of Peterſburg."</p>
               <p>"He did ſo," replied Mrs. Mills, "and enacted many uſeful laws, which juſtly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired him the ſurname of Great. But to my ſtory: This great man, in his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, had ſo great an antipathy to water, that he could not endure to approach even within ſight of it."</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid Clara, "that was the moſt ſtrange antipathy I ever heard of: how ridiculous! to be afraid of water!"</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, my dear girl," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "if I cannot ſee any thing more abſurd, in the Czar's antipathy to water, than in yours to a ſpider—but, however, you ſhall hear my ſtory. This antipathy, which muſt have been an inſuperable bar to all his warlike atchievements."—</p>
               <p>"How ſo, aunt," interrupted William; "I do not comprehend what his diſlike to water had to do with his battles."</p>
               <p>"I ſee, William," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that you are no ſoldier; do you ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine he could make one campaign, without having occaſion to paſs a river, or at leaſt, to encamp on the banks of it, which, was almoſt as dreadful to him?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="unknown:030966_0060_0FEA0CCDF71DCD60"/>
"To be ſure he could not," ſaid Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, "ſtriking his forehead, what a fool I was!</p>
               <p>"Well," rejoined Mrs. Mills, "this infirmity, which would have given his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſo evident an advantage over him was happily overcome by the addreſs of one of his courtiers."</p>
               <p>"One fine day, Prince Galliezin, his governor, and chief favourite, perſuaded him to ride into the country, upon a hunting party, without informing him, there was a brook near the place. After a little diverſion, the favourite cried, what, hot weather! O that there was a river at hand, that I might jump in and bathe! How ſaid the young Czar, would you kill yourſelf? Galliezin anſwered, I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently bathed with your father, and yet your majeſty ſees me alive. Nothing can be more wholeſome in ſultry weather. The Czar was ſurprized, and coldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, I have heard, that people are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently drowned. Ay, ſaid the favourite, but not in water ſcarcely ſo high as one's knees. If you pleaſe, ſir, I will ſend ſome body to look for a ſtream, that you may ſee it poſſible to bathe without drowning. The brook was eaſily found; the Czar rode toward it trembling, and ſtopped his horſe at a diſtance. Galliezen ordered
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:030966_0061_0FEA0CCF9F02ACC8"/>
ſome men to croſs it backward and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, on horſeback; upon which, the Czar ventured to ride nearer. Galliezen ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, rode through himſelf, and order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome of his people to croſs it. They did; the Czar admired at what he ſaw: but, at laſt, had the courage to ride his own horſe over: Pleaſed at what he had performed, he from that time, uſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the water, till by degrees, he got rid of this troubleſome antipathy, which was occaſioned by a fright, in his infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy." "Well, my dear," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "is it, or is it not poſſible to overcome an averſion?"</p>
               <p>"There is no arguing againſt facts ſo convincing," ſaid Clara, "if this ſtory is true—</p>
               <p>It is recorded in the life of Peter the Great, interrupted Mrs. Mills, if it will afford you the leaſt ſatisfaction, I will ſhew it you when we return to the houſe, nearly in the words I have related it. Dear Madam, ſaid Clara, you cannot think I doubt what you ſay.</p>
               <p>"Well then, ſaid Mrs. Mills, I may claim your promiſe."</p>
               <p>"Yes," ſaid Clara, but I have ſuch a diſlike to a ſpider! I have always avoided them, and Jane, my mamma's maid, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing how terrified I was, was always up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:030966_0062_0FEA0CD18BABAFA8"/>
the look out, that I might not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed.</p>
               <p>"Theſe very precautions, my dear," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "have increaſed your diſlike; by conſtantly avoiding the ſight of the object, which diſguſts you, your imagination has painted its deformity great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the reality.</p>
               <p>"La! ſiſter," ſaid William, "there is no harm in a ſpider: you may eaſily get the better of ſuch fooliſh diſlike if you try; let me go and fetch one; you ſhall ſee me handle it; I am not afraid.</p>
               <p>"Oh for heaven ſake," ſaid Clara, catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hold of him, and turning pale with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, "ſtop."</p>
               <p>"Hold William," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "be not in ſuch haſte."</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid William, "I have done, I only wanted to uſe my ſiſter to a ſpider; if once ſhe could be perſuaded to touch one, the buſineſs would be done.</p>
               <p>"You muſt remember, William," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Mrs. Mills, "that the courtier, who ſo happily cured the infirmity of Peter the Great, acted with ſome addreſs; had he, inſtead of inviting him to enjoy the cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the river, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uddenly plunged him into it, 'tis probable he would have ſtrengthened, inſtead of ſurmounting his prejudice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="unknown:030966_0063_0FEA0CD63A776C28"/>
I remember a perſon who had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>its to the day of her death, from a frog, to which ſhe had a particular diſlike, being in jeſt, put upon her neck. People who commit this ſort of violence, on the feelings of others, I am ſorry to ſay, (I do not mean that it is your caſe William), are rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of diverting themſelves, than of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefiting their friends.</p>
               <p>There is ſomething very inhuman in thus ſporting with the infirmities of others; but let us take the next path.</p>
               <p>"But the ſpider, aunt," ſaid Clara, alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,—"we muſt paſs ſo cloſe—indeed, I cannot venture."</p>
               <p>"Nay, now, my dear," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "do not yield to an idle conceit, which your better judgment muſt condemn; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect, that you are not going to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Hyaena, or a Rhinoceros, but to look upon an inoffenſive inſect, to whoſe exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, it is in your power, in an inſtant to put an end, and whoſe ingenuity is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving your higheſt admiration."</p>
               <p>"But may I be ſure, madam, that you will not ſuffer it to crawl upon me," ſaid Clara; "and that you, William, will not play me any trick?" "I will engage for William," replied Mrs. Mills, "and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, you may rely upon me, after what I have ſaid."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="unknown:030966_0064_0FEA0CD833A11E08"/>
"Well then;" ſaid Clara, "but let me go on this ſide—now be ſure, William, you do not play me any trick."</p>
               <p>"Not I," ſaid William; "but you muſt not be angry, if I cannot help laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſee you ſo fooliſh." They now came in ſight of the buſh, where the poor ſpider, little conſcious of the terror it inſpired, had half formed its curious web. When Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra beheld it, with ſuch agility, run from ſide to ſide of the branch, upon which it was weaving its ſubtile ſnare, ſhe ſtarted back, and it was ſome time before ſhe could be prevailed upon to advance: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, encouraged by Mrs. Mills, and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle aſhamed by the raillery of her brother, ſhe approached ſo near, as to ſee diſtinctly the whole progreſs of its ingenious labours. At firſt, her heart beat—ſhe declared it made her ſhudder,—ſhe had never, in her life, looked ſo long upon a ſpider—by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, ſhe became more calm, and at length, proteſted, it was not ſo ugly as ſhe imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned—really, the body was very handſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeckled, and as for the web, it was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhing from whence the thread, with which it was woven, could come." "The ſpider," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "has, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of her body, five openings, through which ſhe diſtills at pleaſure, a clammy glew: this forms the thread, which length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030966_0065_0FEA0CDA00E25180"/>
in proportion to her diſtance, from the place where ſhe firſt faſtens it. When ſhe cloſes theſe openings, the thread, no longer extends, and ſhe remains ſuſpended in the air. Obſerve, Clara, ſhe makes uſe of the thread, for her aſcent, graſping it in her paws, as we ſhould a rope with our hands and feet."</p>
               <p>"Well, really," ſaid Clara, "it is very curious, I ſhould like to ſee in what manner the web is firſt begun; this is half finiſhed."</p>
               <p>"It will be well worth your attention, at another opportunity," ſaid Mrs. Mills.</p>
               <p>"Is the web begun in the middle?" aſked Clara.</p>
               <p>"That cannot be practicable," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "you ſee it is ſuſpended between two branches, the ſpider, therefore, would have no reſting place."</p>
               <p>"Very true, aunt," ſaid William, "I never thought about it before, but really, I cannot conceive, in what part of the web, the ſpider can poſſibly begin."</p>
               <p>"It is a queſtion," replied Mrs. Mills, "that might have puzzled wiſer heads than yours William, had not experience and obſervations fully diſcovered it. When the garden ſpider, for there are many kinds of ſpiders, begins its web, it places itſelf upon the end of a branch, and there faſtens ſeveral threads, which it lengthens to two
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:030966_0066_0FEA0CDD03ECDE18"/>
or more ells, leaving them to float in the air: theſe threads are wafted by the wind, from one ſide to another, and lodged either on a houſe, pole, or the oppoſite branch, where they are faſtened by their natural glew. The ſpider then draws them to her, to try that they be well fixed, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a bridge for her to paſs and repaſs at pleaſure; ſhe then marches to the middle of this thread, and adds to it another, by the help of which ſhe deſcends, till ſhe meets with a ſolid body to reſt upon, or leaves it as the firſt floating in the air, to the direction of chance; in the ſame manner other threads are drawn from the centre, and there again, as you ſee, croſſed. But I will leave the reſt to your own obſervation, which will imform you more agreeably."</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid William, "it muſt be owned the ſpider is a very ingenious creature; I ſhould have puzzled my head for a month, and not gueſſed how ſhe began her web."</p>
               <p>"Nor I," ſaid Clara, "but pray Madam, what is the uſe of the web, when it is made?"</p>
               <p>"Why," ſaid William, burſting into a fit of laughter, "don't you know, that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſpread their webs to catch flies?"</p>
               <p>"If I had known," replied Clara ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what piqued, "I ſhould not have aſked the queſtion."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="unknown:030966_0067_0FEA0CDF63105568"/>
"There is no diſgrace," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "in not knowing a thing, the diſgrace is in not wiſhing to be informed."</p>
               <p>"I did not mean to offend my ſiſter," ſaid William, "only it was ſo droll, to hear her aſk, what ſpiders ſpread their webs for."</p>
               <p>"You know William," ſaid Clara, "that my mamma always ordered the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to take particular care, that I ſhould not be alarmed, with the ſight of a ſpider, ſo you need not be ſo very ſharp upon me."</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid William, "I beg your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, ſiſter, I will be more careful in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture."</p>
               <p>And do ſpiders really feed on flies, Madam? "Undoubtedly," ſaid Mrs. Mills.</p>
               <p>"Well then," ſaid Clara, "if the ſpider is an ingenious creature, you muſt allow that ſhe is very cruel."</p>
               <p>"Pray, my dear, what do you underſtand by the word <hi>cruelty?"</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"Why," ſaid Clara, "I think it is cruel to put an innocent thing to death."</p>
               <p>"By cruelty," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, that depraved inclination which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes us to inflict a pang wantonly; or unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily to deprive any creature of life: now the ſpider ſeizes the prey which nature has made neceſſary to her exiſtence; ſhe cannot, than, any more be chargeable with cruelty, than other animals, man himſelf, not except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:030966_0068_0FEA0CE237B87720"/>
for whoſe uſe innumerable creatures are daily doomed to ſuffer. We may grieve for the ſufferings of the poor fly within the graſp of its enemy, but 'tis unjuſt for our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, to riſe againſt the ſpider, who acts only in conformity to the ſtated laws, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has implanted in its nature.</p>
               <p>However, if you accuſe the ſpider of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, ſhe has one quality, which cannot fail of meeting your approbation; I mean her attention to her young, which is ſo great, that ſhe will incur every danger ſooner than forſake them. She carefully wraps her eggs in a web of aſtoniſhing ſtrength, which ſhe faſtens to a wall, or a leaf, and watches with unremitted ſolicitude: if danger is at hand, her firſt care is to pull down the ſacred de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite and eſcape with it. There is one kind of ſpider, which has recourſe to a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious expedient for the preſervation of her eggs, ſhe ſuſpends her bag eggs in ſome little aperture, perhaps of a wall, by a thread, and before them in the ſame manner, a little packet of dried leaves, which, by conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſwinging about at the entrance, prevent the birds and waſps, who are upon the watch for the eggs, from diſcovering them."</p>
               <p>Well, that is indeed an ingenious contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</p>
               <p>When the little ſpiders are hatched, the mother carries them upon her back, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:030966_0069_0FEA0CE572230D70"/>
her tenderneſs by a thouſand ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citudes: but, come my dear, let us walk on, our ſpider has compleated her web, and I think you are convinced it is poſſible to look upon one, without fainting or falling into fits.</p>
               <p>"Indeed, Madam," ſaid Clara, "I am; and feel ſo far reconciled to the ſight of what I once ſo much dreaded, that I think, in time, it might be poſſible for me to ſee a ſpider crawling on my hand, with as little concern as I have felt in hearing it named."</p>
               <p>"You ſee, my dear," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "what a little reſolution and proper reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will accompliſh; but to this habit, which, in theſe caſes, is often more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than reaſon itſelf, muſt be joined by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently accuſtoming yourſelf to look at, and examine a ſpider, when you conſider that its deformities will grow familiar, and your diſguſt wear away."</p>
               <p>"Well, aunt," ſaid Clara, "I am reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as this is the caſe, to pay my reſpects e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, while I am here, to the ſpiders that inhabit your garden."</p>
               <p>"It is the reſolution of a ſenſible girl," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "but what is William exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining with ſuch attention?"</p>
               <p>"Bleſs me," ſaid Clara, "what a</p>

               <p>"It is," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "and is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly preparing for its change."</p>
               <p>"It muſt be a very curious change," ſaid Clara: "it puts one in mind of the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations, one reads of, in the tales of the fairies."</p>
               <p>"I know of nothing recorded in tales of the fairies," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful than the operations of nature, but familiarity cauſes us too often to view the moſt intereſting objects with indifference."</p>
               <p>"But pray, Madam." ſaid Clara, "is it not ſtrange, that one never ſees a caterpillar actually changing into a butterfly?"</p>

               <p>Pray what is that?</p>

               <p>"How wonderful," ſaid Clara! "but pray, Madam, do ſilk worms undergo any change?"</p>
               <p>

"The ſilk worm," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "changes to a moth, in the ſame manner as the caterpillar does into a butterfly: there is a great reſemblance between the ſilk worm and thoſe caterpillars which ſpin themſelves a covering."</p>
               <p>"Ah," ſaid William, "but ſilk worms are of ſome uſe; we are obliged to them for all the fine ſilks we admire; as for caterpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, they are good for nothing."</p>
               <p>"I am very ready," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "to acknowledge all our obligations to the ſilk worm; but ſhould be ſorry to ſuppoſe for a moment, that infinate Wiſdom has formed the moſt inſignificant creatures in vain."</p>
               <p>"Why, madam," ſaid William, "of what uſe can caterpillars be? I am ſure I have heard our gardener ſay that they injure the trees and plants very much."</p>
               <p>"It muſt be owned," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "that our trees and plants ſometimes ſuffer from the viſits of theſe inſects; but then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain it muſt be remembered, that the poor birds, as well thoſe which ſupply our table as thoſe which delight us with their ſong, would ſuffer ſtill more ſeverely from their abſence."</p>
               <p>"How ſo, aunt?"</p>
               <p>"Caterpillars and worms," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "are the food of young birds: the parents do not forſake their egg till the fields
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:030966_0073_0FEA0CEF40B3FE20"/>
are repleniſhed with theſe inſects, which diſappear when the earth is covered with grain and other proviſion, and the young brood has acquired ſtrength to digeſt it. You muſt allow, that the caterpillar, who furniſhes ſupport for the young birds, has, in its turn, a title alſo to ſupport; and this it finds in the plants and verdure of the earth: its depredations, to our imperfect view, may ſometimes alarm, but that wiſe Being who formed, and knows to what uſe he has aſſigned the creature, knows when to permit and when to ſet bounds to its rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges."</p>
               <p>Our party, mutually pleaſed with each other, had ſtrolled conſiderably further than they at firſt deſigned: They had for ſome time left Mrs. Mills's encloſures, and were proceeding down a ſhady lane that led to the village, when their ears were aſſailed by the noiſe of ſeveral hammers which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a blackſmith's ſhop. Mrs. Mills in vain endeavoured to raiſe her voice, and the young people to attend, the nearer they approached, the louder were the ſounds, which encreaſed, till ſilence was at laſt all that could be oppoſed to them.</p>
               <p>Clara, who was extremely intereſted in her aunt's diſcourſe, was much diſconcerted at the interuption: and, as ſoon as ſhe could make herſelf underſtood, declared, with
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:030966_0074_0FEA0CF19D0805A8"/>
ſome impatience, that ſuch trades were quite a nuiſance, and ought not to be ſuffered.</p>
               <p>"Come, come," ſaid William, "do not be too ſevere, ſiſter; the noiſe of a black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith's hammer is not ſo bad as the ſmell of a tanner's pits."</p>
               <p>"I am ſure," ſaid Clara, "no ſmell can be ſo inſupportable as the horrid din of thoſe abominable hammers; I declare, we are not yet beyond the ſound of them, they have put every thing my aunt was telling us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the caterpillars out of my head."</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid William, "both the tanner and blackſmith are bad enough, to be ſure; you would ſay ſo, Clara, if you were as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly regaled with the ſmell of the ſtinking hides as we are at ſchool: There are ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"I am quite of your opinion, brother," replied Clara, "they are quite a nuiſance."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mills, perceiving they had nearly exhauſted their rage againſt the poor tanner and blackſmith, now broke the ſilence ſhe had for ſome time kept. "You think then," ſaid ſhe, "that every perſon of conſequence ſhould diſmiſs the honeſt blackſmith and tanner from their eſtate?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="unknown:030966_0075_0FEA0CF346A64540"/>
"Indeed, aunt, we do," replied Clara; trades that are ſuch a nuiſance ſhould not be encouraged."</p>
               <p>"I am afraid then," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "the ſaw and mallet of the carpenter, the chiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the maſon, the grindſtone of the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and the appendages of many uſeful trades, will give the profeſſors little chance of your favor, in ſhort, were I to judge by your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience, at the ſmall inconvenience you have ſuſtained from the tanner and black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith, I ſhould predict that the mechanic arts, in general, would not find a warm friend in either."</p>
               <p>"No, aunt," ſaid William, "we do not ſay that we ſhould diſcard all; but ſome, you muſt allow, are leſs uſeful and more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable than others."</p>
               <p>"All, my dear William, are uſeful in their turn; none more ſo than thoſe which you deſpiſe: were examples wanting to prove what daily experience ſo clearly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrates, I could relate a circumſtance, in which their utility was proved in a very critical ſituation."</p>
               <p>"Dear aunt, do relate it," exclaimed the young people.</p>
               <p>"My dears, it is a narrative of ſome length and we are already at home."</p>
               <p>"Nay, now you have raiſed our curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="73" facs="unknown:030966_0076_0FEA0CF7C0A106A8"/>
"Well," ſaid Mrs. Mills, ever ready to oblige, "when we get home, I will look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong my papers for an extract I made of the circumſtance; and, after dinner, read it."</p>
               <p>At this moment the door opened, and they ſeperated to dreſs for dinner.</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid Clara to her brother, whom on her return, ſhe found alone in the dining parlour, "Who could have thought that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt two whole days could have been ſpent ſo agreeably in this ſolitary place, without any other company than one's aunt!"</p>
               <p>"Ah," ſaid William, "who could have thought it!"</p>
               <p>"I declare I have not yet," ſaid Clara, "found one hour tedious: My aunt is a charming woman; my papa ſaid ſo, but I did not believe him. I already begin to love her dearly, ſhe is ſo kind and agreeable."</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied William, "ſhe has always ſomething new to tell us; but huſh—.</p>
               <p>The entrance of Mrs. Mills broke off the diſcourſe, and dinner ſoon after followed.</p>
               <p>The young people were not a little pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſee that their aunt had been mindful of her promiſe; the deſſert being removed, ſhe drew from her pocket, a written paper, and read to them, the following</p>

               <p>On the 23d of April, 1755, the Doding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, a ſhip belonging to the Eaſt India Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, ſailed from the Downs, and on the 17th of July following, about one in the morning, ſtruck on a rock diſtant, eaſt from the Cape of Good Hope, about 250 leagues. Of 270 ſouls that were on board when the ſhip ſtruck, 23 only eſcaped to the ſhore, which was a barren uninhabited rock, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parantly capable of affording them but a temporary ſuccour. Their firſt care, was to ſearch among the things, which the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the ſea had thrown upon the rocks, for ſomething to cover them, and in this, they ſucceeded beyond their hopes. They next felt the want of fire, which was not ſo eaſily ſupplied: Some attempted to kindle two pieces of wood, by rubbing them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, while others were ſearching among the rocks, in hopes of picking up ſomething to ſerve for a flint and ſteel. After a long ſearch, a box containing two gun flints, and a broken file, was found; this was a joyful acquiſition, but ſtill, till ſomething like tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der could be procured, the flints and ſteel
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:030966_0078_0FEA0CFD6C127498"/>
were uſeleſs; a further, ſearch was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore undertaken, with inexpreſſible anxiety; and at laſt, a caſk of gun-powder was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered; but this, to their great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, proved to be wet: a ſmall quantity, however, that had ſuffered no da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, upon a cloſe examination, was found at the bottom of the caſk. Some of this, they bruiſed on a linen rag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The wounded gathered around it, and the reſt went in ſearch of other neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, without which, the rock could afford them but a ſhort reſpite from deſtruction. In the afternoon, (for the ſhip ſtruck about 3 in the morning) a box of wax candles, and a caſk of brandy, were brought in, and ſoon after, ſome others of the party return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an account, that they had diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a caſk almoſt full of freſh water, which was even more welcome than the brandy. The chief mate brought in ſome pieces of ſalt pork, and ſoon after others arrived, dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

The approach of night, made it neceſſary to provide ſome ſhelter; all hands were employed, and a tent was at laſt made of ſome canvaſs that had been thrown aſhore, though it was ſo ſmall, for want of more ſail cloth, that it would not hold them all. They were obliged to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:030966_0079_0FEA0CFFCE735740"/>
their tent upon the higheſt part of the iſland, from fear of being overflowed; and this was covered with the dung of a large kind of water fowl, called a gannet, by which the iſland was much frequented. As they had paſſed the day, without food, they had paſſed the night without reſt, being ſunk a foot in the fowls dung, and the fire conſtantly being extinguiſhed, by the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempeſtuouſneſs of the night.</p>
               <q rend="inline normQuotes">
                  <p>The next day the company were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led together, to eat their firſt meal, and ſome raſhers of pork were broiled upon the coals for dinner. The ſitting thus diſconſolate and forlorn down to a repaſt they had been uſed to ſhare in convivial cheerfulneſs, ſtruck them with ſuch a ſenſe of their condition, that they burſt into paſſionate lamentations, wringing their hands, and looking round them with all the wildneſs of diſpair; in ſuch a tumult of mind, the thoughts naturally hurry from one ſubject to another, to fix, if poſſible, upon ſomething that may afford comfort: one of the company recollected that the carpenter was among them, and ſuggeſted to the reſt, as a ſubject of hope, that, with his aſſiſtance, it might be poſſible to build a ſtrong ſloop, if tools and materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als could be procured.</p>
                  <p>Every one's attention was immediately turned upon the carpenter, who declared
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:030966_0080_0FEA0D01651ED690"/>
he had no doubt he ſhould be able to build a ſloop that would carry them to ſome port of ſafety, if tools and materials could be found.</p>
                  <p>At that time they had no rational pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of procuring either; yet they had no ſooner placed their deliverance, one remove beyond total impoſſibility, than they ſeemed to think it neither improbable nor difficult; they began to eat without repining, and from that moment the boat engroſſed their whole converſation. As ſoon as they had finiſhed their repaſt, ſome went in ſearch of tools, which were, however not that day to be found, and others to mend the tent. The next day they ſecured four butts of water, a caſk of flour, a hogſhead of brandy, and one of their little boats, which had been thrown up by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ide, in a ſhattered condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Hitherto they had found no tools, excepting a ſcraper; but the day after, they had the good fortune to find a hamper, in which were files, ſail needles, gimlets, and an azimuth compaſs-card. They alſo found two quadrants, a carpenter's adze, a chiſel, three ſword blades, ſome timber, plank, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſs and cordage. Theſe they ſecured with great joy, though they were in want of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny implements, without which, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the carpenter to work: he had juſt finiſhed a ſaw, but had neither hammer nor nails. In this dilemma, it happened
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:030966_0081_0FEA0D055D286E88"/>
that one of the ſeamen, a Swede by birth, picked up an old pair of bellows, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to his companions, told them he had been by profeſſion a ſmith, and that, with theſe bellows, and a forge, which he hoped, by his direction, they would be able to build, he could furniſh the carpenter with all the tools he could want, nails included, as plenty of iron might be obtained, by burning the timber, which had come on ſhore from the wreck. This account was receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with tranſport of joy: the ſmith imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately applied himſelf to mending the bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and the three following days were ſpent in building a tent, and a forge; in bringing together the timber and plank for the uſe of the carpenter, who was in the mean time buſy in getting ready the few tools he had, that he might begin the boat as ſoon as poſſible: this, aſſiſted by the quarter-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, he did the next day; the ſmith alſo fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed his forge, laid in a quantity of fir for fuel, and from this day they both continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to work with indefatigable diligence, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept when prevented by the weather. The ſmith having fortunately found the ring and nut of a bower anchor which ſerved him for an anvil, ſupplied chiſels, axes, ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, and nails as they were wanted; and the carpenter uſed them with great dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and diſpatch, till the 31ſt, when he
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:030966_0082_0FEA0D0701D82718"/>
fell ſick. As the lives of the whole compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny depended upon his recovery, we may judge with what anxiety they awaited it; and with what unſpeakable joy they beheld him, in a few days, ſo far reſtored, as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to work.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the ſtores they had ſaved from the wreck were ſo nearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, that they came to an allowance of two ounces of bread a man per day; and had no ſalt pork but what they determined to keep to victual the boat; for their eſcape ſcarcely depended leſs upon ſea ſtores than on the ſails themſelves: their water alſo fell ſhort. In this diſtreſs, they had recourſe to ſeveral expedients: they dug a well in hopes to find a ſpring, but were diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: they atempted to knock down ſome of the gannets that ſettled upon the top of the rock, and in this they ſucceeded better; but found the fleſh very rank, and perfectly black. They alſo made a raft, or float, called a cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maran, on which they purpoſed to go out a fiſhing, with ſuch hooks and lines as had come on ſhore; and on theſe they had ſome ſucceſs, till they were intimidated by an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident from the further uſe of them.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Colet, the ſecond mate, and Mr. Yets, the midſhipman, had been out one afternoon, till four o'clock, when they endeavoured to make to land: but the wind ſuddenly blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:030966_0083_0FEA0D0998062198"/>
to the weſt, they found that inſtead of approaching the ſhore, they were driven ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry faſt out to ſea. The people on ſhore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their diſtreſs, and ſent out another float to their aſſiſtance; but the ſurf was ſo great that it overſet three times; and the men were obliged to ſwim. In the mean time they ſaw their friends driving out to ſea at a great rate; and were juſt giving them up to deſtruction, when the carpenter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived their hopes, by ſending them word that he would make the little boat (which the reader may recollect had been thrown on ſhore in a ſhattered condition) ſo tight that it ſhould not take in water faſter than one man could heave it out: this he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched in a quarter of an hour; and every one being willing to venture out for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of their friends, it ſoon overtook the float, received the mate and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion on board, and returned ſafe to ſhore.</p>
                  <p>It was now thought dangerous to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture out any more on the float: the carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, therefore, again went to work on the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle boat, and put it into complete repair. In this they frequently took great quantities of fiſh. Three of the company alſo having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a great ſmoke on the main land, embarked in it, in hopes of making ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery favourable to their ſituation: but having been out forty eight hours, loſt one
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:030966_0084_0FEA0D0CC15F6508"/>
of their companions by overſetting of the boat, and incurred many dangers from the Indians, who came down upon them; they returned, giving thanks to God for having permitted them to return ſafe to a place which, however barren and deſolate, they now conſidered as an aſylum from a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of greater diſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>"In the mean while the whole company was thrown into the utmoſt conſternation and alarm, by an accident that happened to the carpenter, who cut his leg in ſuch a manner, that he was in great danger of bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to death. What anxiety, what alarm did not this occaſion! They had no ſurgeon among them, nor any thing proper to apply to the wound; yet under God, their exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence depended upon the life of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter. However, with much difficulty, the blood was at length ſtaunched, and the wound healed without any bad ſymptom. Soon after this they found a fowling-piece, which was a great treaſure; for though the barrel was much bent, by the aſſiſtance of their ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="82" facs="unknown:030966_0085_0FEA0D1025380F98"/>
which they ſettled to lay their eggs, to the great joy of the company, who were for ſome time conſtantly ſupplied with them in great plenty. The carpenter and ſmith, in the mean while continued to work upon the boat, and the people were buſied in collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what was, from time to time, thrown up from the wreck; eſpecially cordage and canvaſs, which was neceſſary to rig the boat and ſome caſks of freſh water. They had alſo fortunately ſome rainy weather, which proved very acceptable, as they contrived to ſave ſome of the water for ſea ſtores; their eſcape ſcarcely depending leſs upon freſh water than upon the ſails. But they were ſtill in want of bread, having lived many days on ſhort allowance. As a laſt recourſe, they thought of building an oven, as they had ſome barrels of flour, though they had no bread, and ſucceeding beyond their expectations, they converted the flour into a tolerable biſcuit. This was, however, at length ſo nearly exhauſted, that they were forced to live upon a few ounces a day, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out brandy, of which there remained only a ſmall quantity; and this they preſerved inviolate for the uſe of the carpenter. Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was alſo ſo ſhort, that they were allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only half a pint a day. In this conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, however, they providentially, in a great degree, preſerved their health and ſtrength;

and, on the 16th of February, launched their little bark, calling her The Happy De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance: On the 17th, they got their little pittance of ſtores on board, and on the 18th, ſet ſail from the rock, on which they had lived juſt ſeven months, giving it at parting the name of the Bird Iſland.</p>

               <p>"I am ſorry," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that you have been ſevere againſt any one; but, pray, who is this Charles Franklin?"</p>

"Why," replied William, "he is one of the boys at our ſchool; his father is worth a deal of money, but he is an ironmonger; ſo, as Charles is the only tradeſman's ſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, all the boys make game of him, and many will not keep him company; though, to ſay the truth, he is as genteel as any of us, and takes his learning as well."</p>
               <p>"I am ſorry," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "to hear that you were capable of joining in ſuch il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberal conduct: I know of no other diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between the gentleman and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon man than that of the heart, manners, and underſtanding."</p>
               <p>"Why, aunt," ſaid William, "I own I have been ſometimes aſhamed, but at ſchool one muſt do as the others do; the great boys lead, and the little ones follow."</p>
               <p>"I am ſorry to obſerve," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "that you have betrayed a very cowardly ſpirit, in being afraid of reſiſting what you know to be wrong, merely becauſe others were ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"But, aunt, if I had not joined in the laugh againſt Charles Franklin, I ſhould have been laughed at myſelf."</p>
               <p>"My dear William, never ſuffer a falſe ſenſe of ſhame to deter you from doing what you think to be right: This ſort of compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance may lead you into dangerous errors.
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:030966_0088_0FEA0D16D54CE180"/>
To-morrow, after dinner, I will illuſtrate my obſervation, by a ſtory, which I think will afford you ſome entertainment."</p>
               <p>"O ſaid Clara," I am glad we ſhall have a ſtory; your ſtories, madam, are ſo inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting!"</p>
               <p>"I am happy, my dear, they give you pleaſure."</p>
               <p>"But cannot we have it now, dear ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam?"</p>
               <p>"It is nearly tea time," replied Mrs. Mills.</p>
               <p>"Very true," ſaid William, "and we muſt not forget the microſcope."</p>
               <p>"Nor muſt I forget," returned Mrs. Mills, ſmiling, "that I have not yet heard Clara touch the piano forte."</p>
               <p>"But the miſcroſcope, dear madam," ſaid Clara, "I do ſo long to ſee it!"</p>
               <p>"Nor am I leſs impatient," ſaid Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, "to hear the ſtory."</p>
               <p>"To-morrow," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "will be long enough for both; we muſt not be prodigal of our pleaſures."</p>
               <p>William and his ſiſter were too ſenſible of their aunt's kindneſs to preſs her further; and the tea things being removed, Clara, unaſked, ſat down to the piano. Though not a proficient, ſhe played and ſung pretti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and, in the preſent inſtance her readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to oblige entirely covered the defect
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:030966_0089_0FE9FD065FF75D68"/>
of her performance. Her aunt was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed, and with regret obſerved, at nine o'clock, that it was time to ſeparate.</p>
               <p>The next morning after breakfaſt, the young people did not forget to remind their aunt of the microſcope.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mills expreſſed her readineſs to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge their curioſity; but added, that if ſhe might adviſe, a turn in the garden would be better, as the microſcope would furniſh entertainment when it was too ſultry to walk.</p>
               <p>The young people immediately aſſented, and they all three took their way to</p>

               <p>"What a beautiful ſhew of tulips!" ſaid Clara;" I think I never ſaw greater variety nor more brilliant colours!"</p>
               <p>"But what do you think of my auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las!" ſaid Mrs. Mills, pointing to a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful aſſemblage on her left hand.</p>

               <p>"Do you think, aunt," rejoined Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, "that any other country beſides Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land can ſhew ſuch a number of beautiful flowers; there is no end of their variety?"</p>
               <p>"It is certainly very great," ſaid Mrs. Mills; "but we muſt not forget that we are
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:030966_0090_0FEA0D1921A85540"/>
indebted to other climates for that beauty and variety."</p>
               <p>"How, aunt," "ſaid William; "are not theſe flowers the growth of our own country?"</p>
               <p>"They undoubtedly grow here," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "and, as you ſee, thrive; but no plant can properly be called the natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of a country that will not grow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pains of culture, which you know few of vegetables or garden flowers will. For the auricula we are indebted to Caira; for the tulip to Cappadocia, a province of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia the pink and carnation come from Italy; the lily from Syria; the tuberoſe from Java and Ceyland, iſlands in the Indian Ocean; and the delicate fragrant jeſſamine, which I am ſure we all admire, is a native of the Eaſt Indies.

Corn is nevertheleſs of foreign origin, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed are more of our vegetables and herb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. The colliflower comes from Cyprus, an iſland in the Levant; aſparagus from Aſia; ſharlots from Siberia; and horſe-radiſh from China. Lentils we owe to France, and kidney-beans to the Eaſt Indies; garlic alſo is produced naturally in that part of the world. When America was firſt diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which you know was in the year 1492, by Chriſtopher Columbus, a number of plants and flowers were found there, till then unknown to the reſt of Europe, to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts of which they have been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted. We are obliged to Brazil, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of South America, for that excellent and uſeful vegetable, the potatoe."</p>

that all our vegetables and flowers came from foreign countries."</p>
               <p>"The ſoil of each different country," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed Mrs. Mills, "contains juices proper for the nouriſhment of the vegetables pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to it, and theſe, if deprived of ſuch jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, will naturally wither and die."</p>
               <p>"How is it then," interrupted William, "that we have pinks, roſes, and all theſe beautiful flowers and good vegetables, if they will not grow any where but in their own ſoil?"</p>
               <p>"I did not tell you," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "that they would not grow any where but in their native ſoil, but that ſuch juices were requiſite to nouriſh them."</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid William, "that is pretty nearly the ſame."</p>
               <p>"No;" replied Mrs. Mills, "it alters the caſe very much."</p>
               <p>"You muſt remember, my dear boy, that it is poſſible for art to imitate nature; this is the province of the gardner, who by a mixture of different ſorts of earth, clay, gravel, marl, chalk, &amp;c. prepares a ſoil proper for the nouriſhment of the plant or vegetables, he means to foſter, and regulates the heat according to that which nature has made neceſſary to it; and thus, as an ingenious author, who has, in part furniſhed the information I have juſt given you, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,

               <p>"But how is it aunt," ſaid Clara, "that we ſee ſo many different ſorts of flowers grow out of the ſame bed? from what you have ſaid, I ſhould ſuppoſe, the juices that were fit for one kind, would not be ſo for another."</p>
               <p>"Every plant," my dear Clara, "replied Mrs. Mills, "is capable of chooſing for it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; the wiſe author of nature has provided each with a ſet of veſſels or fibres, that ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly attract and admit thoſe juices that are proper for its nature and reject all other.</p>
               <p>"Theſe juices are ſet in motion by the air and heat, and circulate through the whole plant in the ſame manner as the blood does through our veins."</p>
               <p>"Dear Madam," ſaid Clara, "where can you poſſibly have learnt ſo many curious particulars?"</p>

               <p>They then examined the wing itſelf, and perceived, that when the duſt was rubbed off, a thin ſkin only remained perforated, with little holes, the actual ſockets, which contained the quills. "Well," ſaid Clara, "this is indeed wonderful, I ſee the wing

of a butterfly is as truly compoſed of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as the wing of a bird."</p>

               <p>"But do you obſerve," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "upon its head, two little immoveable creſcents, ſhaped like a ſplit pea, and upon theſe a number of minute eyes? each is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a ſet of fibres or optic nerves."</p>

               <p>"Yes," ſaid William, "but who could have thought ſhe was provided with a little bruſh, for the purpoſe."</p>

               <p>Clara and her brother were extremely delighted with the wonders of the micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope, and Mrs. Mills aſſured them, they would find them inexhauſtible. "A grain of ſand, a drop of water, the minuteſt leaf," ſaid ſhe, "will furniſh you with an ample field for ſpeculation, and lead you to adore that Being, whoſe wiſdom ſhines in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuteſt of his works; the ſting of a gnat, the point of which is ſcarcely diſcernable, in

him. Mr. Weldon had a wife, four daughters, and a ſon with the latter of whom Sir John was ſo pleaſed, that he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, if it met his father's approbation, to educate him with his own ſon. The offer was too advantageous to be rejected, it was embraced with the warmeſt gratitude, and Charles, a few weeks after, having taken a tender farewel of his parents and ſiſters, ſet off with the ſon of his patron for a ſeminary ſome miles diſtant. Young Bentley was at this time nearly two years older than Charles, who had juſt entered his twelfth year; he was the ſole ſurviving hope of his family, and from his cradle had been ſpoiled by flattery and indulgence; unaccuſtomed to reſtraint, his paſſions had gathered ſtrength, and though he had naturally good ſenſe, and a heart hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and affectionate, he ſeldom liſtened to the ſuggeſtion of theſe, but ſacrificed every worthy principle to the whim that actuated him for the moment. He was, beſide, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent and haughty, and a great ſhare of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy was viſible in his diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>"Charles, on the other hand, had an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent heart, and an underſtanding capable of the higheſt improvement; but he had one failing, that conſtantly counteracted the good effect theſe would naturally have produced on his conduct; this was an eaſineſs of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, carried to ſuch exceſs, that his conduct

ſeemed rather to depend on thoſe with whom he aſſociated, than on the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his own heart or the principles inſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led into him by his father.</p>

                  <p>He loved virtue, he deteſted vice, but he wanted reſolution to maintain the one and to reſiſt the other: He was continually entering into things that his heart, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, merely becauſe he was unable to withſtand the laugh, or reſiſt the perſuaſion of his companions. This unfortunate pliabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of temper, added to his ſprightly good-humour, rendered Charles a favorite of young Bentley, and they ſoon became inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable companions.</p>
                  <p>At the requeſt of young Bentley, it was agreed that Charles ſhould ſpend the vacati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with him: at the cloſe of the year, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the young people ſet out together for Sir John's houſe in London.</p>
                  <p>Edward, for that was young Bentley's name, was received with the greateſt joy and affection by his parents, who flattered themſelves, he was greatly improved; nor did they forget Charles, whoſe heart beat with gratitude and pleaſure at the kind re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception he experienced from his patron and Lady Bentley. The holidays ſeemed to communicate equal joy both to him and his

Young Bentley had his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle parties at home and abroad; and Charles, unaccuſtomed to the gaity that ſurrounded him, thought all happineſs and enchantment. Ten days elapſed in this manner, when one morning, as he was entering a toy-ſhop to execute his commiſſion his friend Edward had given him, his eyes glanced upon fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures which ſeemed familiar to him. Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity induced him to turn off the ſtep, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the perſon who had thus tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently attracted his obſervation. It was a young woman, clean but meanly clothed, ſupported upon crutches; in her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance diſeaſe and want were ſtrongly pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured. Charles overtook her in an inſtant, and, as with difficulty ſhe dragged her weight along, wholly abſorbed in her own miſery, looked ſtedfaſtly upon her face. One while he thought himſelf miſtaken; another that it was impoſſible for two faces ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reſemble each other; at length reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſatisfy his doubts: "Catharine!" ſaid he, in a tone of enquiry. The young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man looked up, and turning her hollow eyes upon Charles, in her turn, looked ſtedfaſtly on him, and exclaimed at laſt: Gracious me! do I ſee Maſter Charles Weldon!</p>
               </q>
               <p>"Ah, Catharine!" ſaid Charles, kindly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ing her by the hand, "I little thought
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:030966_0102_0FE9FD10210840C8"/>
to have ſeen you reduced to this miſerable ſtate!"</p>
               <p>"You ſee, my good young maſter," ſaid the poor woman, "what ſickneſs and pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty can bring one to. Thank heaven I have little to reproach myſelf with. I am ſtill honeſt, and as long as I was able, was glad to work: but it has pleaſed God, for ſome wiſe end, to afflict me, and I ſubmit with patience."</p>
               <p>"But where do you live Catharine?" ſaid Charles. "Are you in place? Have you been long a cripple?"</p>
               <p>"You know, maſter Charles," ſaid Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, "that I left my maſter's and came up to town, thinking to better myſelf; but I repented it ſince. I ſoon got into place, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and was liked very well by my maſter and miſtreſs; but when I was ſeized with this rheumatiſm, and could no longer do their buſineſs, it was not to be expected they would keep me: So I took my lodging down the ſtreet, you ſee yonder, where, by degrees, I parted with all my cloaths to ſupport myſelf. My miſtreſs was, indeed, very kind, and gave me money at different times; but, as I was not able to work, it was ſoon gone. I have not a great ſtomach, maſter Charles, but indeed I have many times known a want of the little I could have eaten."</p>
               <p>"Poor ſoul!" ſaid Charles, his eyes filling
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:030966_0103_0FEA0D3652279D10"/>
with tears, "Why did you not let my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther know of your diſtreſs? But is there no hope of your ever being reſtored to the uſe of your limbs?"</p>
               <p>"None, ſir," returned Catharine, "un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs I could go to Bath: the charitable doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors who give me advice, ſay, that is the only thing that can reſtore me: but it is not for ſuch a poor miſerable creature, as I am, to think of ſo long a journey. Where ſhould I find money to bear the expence!"</p>
               <p>"How I wiſh," ſaid Charles, "that it were in my power to aſſiſt you! How much money, do you think, would take you to Bath?"</p>
               <p>"Ah! ſir," ſaid Catharine, "I am ſo helpleſs I could not attempt ſo long a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney with leſs than a guinea and a half: for nobody you know, maſter Charles, in a ſtrange place, would take me in, without I could firſt pay down the money for a lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."</p>
               <p>"And do you think," ſaid Charles, "that a guinea and a half would do, Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, ſir," replied Catharine, "I could make that do very well. You muſt know, maſter Charles, there is a poor widow who lodges upon the ſame floor that I do: ſhe has been very kind to me in my diſtreſs. God knows I muſt have ſtarved if it had not been
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:030966_0104_0FEA0D39839D6270"/>
for her. She is now going to live with her daughter, who keeps a ſhop at Bath. To be ſure I was very ſelfiſh; but indeed, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Charles, it almoſt broke my heart when I heard I was to loſe her. It then came into my head, that if I could but raiſe a little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to bear the expence of the journey, I might go with her, and ſtand a chance of recovering the uſe of my poor limbs: and in caſe I was not ſo happy, I conſidered that, let the worſt come to the worſt, I was a: likely to get a little needle-work there as here. This made me very anxious to go; and, at laſt I took heart, and determined to aſk my good miſtreſs once more to ſtand my friend: But what do you think, ſir, when I went to the houſe, I found the whole family in grief and confuſion: My poor miſtreſs, two days ago, ſuddenly dropt down dead. My laſt reſource, therefore, has failed, and I am ſenſible that it is my duty to ſubmit patiently to the will of my Creator."</p>
               <p>"But your friend is not gone!" ſaid Charles, eagerly.</p>
               <p>"She ſets out in the waggon to-morrow night," returned the poor woman with a ſigh.</p>
               <p>The expreſſive eyes of Charles ſparkled on this intelligence: "How happy am I," ſaid he, "that I met you, and that it is in my power to aſſiſt you! Set your heart at reſt,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:030966_0105_0FEA0D3B26BA8530"/>
my good Catharine, you ſhall go with your friend—I have a guinea and a half—How rejoiced I am that I ſaved it!" Saying this, he put his hand to his pocket; but recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, "I have unluckily," he added, "changed my waiſtcoat this morning and have not the money about me. I will ſtep home for it now; or, if it will make no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, bring it to you in the courſe of a few hours."</p>
               <p>"Oh! my dear young maſter," ſaid Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine, "you are too good.—But your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa and mamma, will they give their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent?"—</p>
               <p>"My father and mother," interrupted Charles, "are not in town; if they were, I know they would aſſiſt you more than I can.—As to the money I ſpeak of it is my own, and I may do as I like with it. I ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to ſpend in preſents for my ſiſters, when I returned into the country; but I know they will be better pleaſed to hear you have it, than with any preſents I could take them."</p>
               <p>"And will you, indeed, be ſo generous?" ſaid the poor woman, whoſe cheek was fluſhed with hope, "will you be ſo generous to a poor creature, who can make no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn?"</p>
               <p>"Say no more, my good Catharine," ſaid Charles, "I am ſure the pleaſure I ſhall have
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:030966_0106_0FEA0D3CF7679BE8"/>
in aſſiſting you, will be greater than that you can conceive from the trifle it is in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to appropriate to your uſe. Tell me your direction, and depend upon ſeeing me in a few hours."</p>
               <p>"Ah! ſir," ſaid Catharine, "God who has ſent you to my relief, will not ſuffer your goodneſs to go unrewarded." Then having pointed out to him the houſe where ſhe liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe added, a thouſand bleſſings go with you; and Charles having bid her farewel, was returning to the toy-ſhop, when ſtepping back a few paces, "you appear to walk in great pain, Catharine," ſaid he, "let me guide you over this croſſway; reſt upon my arm—there, do not hurry yourſelf."</p>
               <p>"Oh! how good you are, maſter Charles," ſaid Catharine,—"there are few young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen like you."</p>
               <p>"Nay," ſaid Charles, "there is ſurely no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſingular in being commonly humane, and wiſhing to take care of one who has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten guided and taken care of me."—Then having conducted her to the end of the ſtreet where ſhe lived, he added, "good bye, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine, depend upon ſeeing me before night."</p>
               <p>Charles now, in reality, repaired to the toy-ſhop, where having executed his friend's commiſſion, he returned home.</p>
               <p>"Charles, my boy," ſaid Edward, upon
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:030966_0107_0FEA0D415DEBD210"/>
his entrance, "I have juſt hit on an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſcheme!"</p>
               <p>"Have you," replied Charles, who was always happy when his friend was pleaſed: "what is it?"</p>
               <p>"Why," ſaid Edward, "you know my father and mother went out early this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: they are ſent for to a friend who is ſick, ten or fifteen miles off; ſo we may be ſure they will not return till late in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."</p>
               <p>"And what then?"</p>
               <p>"It has juſt come into my head, Charles, that we may have a nice canter."</p>
               <p>"A canter;"</p>
               <p>"Yes," returned the young gentleman, Lightfoot, my papa's hunter, is in the ſtable: I can ride him, and you can have the little black poney. Nothing could have happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more lucky; there is a review at Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heath; it will be a nice ride: and"—</p>
               <p>"But have you aſked leave, Edward?" interrupted Charles.</p>
               <p>"That would have been to no purpoſe," returned the young gentleman; "you know my mother would have been frightened out of her wits at the thought of my mounting Lightfoot."</p>
               <p>"Then how can you think of ſuch a thing," ſaid Charles; "beſides, I now recollect hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sir John and my lady both deſire you
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:030966_0108_0FEA0D42FB4A2960"/>
would ſtay at home to be ready for Mr. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the miniature painter, who, you know, is this afternoon to take your picture. I am ſure they would be extremely diſpleaſed were you to be out of the way."</p>
               <p>"There now," ſaid Edward, "I knew you would raiſe ſome objection: I never ſet on foot any thing that you do not oppoſe."</p>
               <p>"You do me great injuſtice, Edward," returned Charles; "you know I am never ſo happy as when I can oblige you; but I love you too well, not to tell you when I ſee you do wrong; and, indeed Edward, you are much to blame to think of going out af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſtrict charge Sir John and my lady gave you to the contrary; and to take Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot will make it ten times worſe. You ſay your mother would be frightened out of her wits were ſhe to know you mounted him—What do you think ſhe will ſay, when ſhe hears of your diſobedience?"</p>
               <p>"She will know nothing of the matter," ſaid Edward, "we ſhall be home long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough before ſhe, or my father, or even the painter comes, and I warrant I will ſtop George's mouth: he will go with us, and will not blab for his own ſake."</p>
               <p>"You have very indulgent parents, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward," ſaid Charles, "and there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very mean in betraying their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and then to draw the ſervant in"—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="unknown:030966_0109_0FEA0D457508CC28"/>
"I think," returned Edward, ſomewhat piqued at his friend's freedom, "that I know my duty as well as yourſelf. Was it any thing of conſequence, I ſhould be as ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous, for I think I love my father as well as you do your's."</p>
               <p>"I do not diſpute that," ſaid Charles; "nor mean, my dear Edward, to offend you; but merely to prevail upon you to give up this fooliſh ſcheme. There will probably be another review before the holidays are over, and then, I dare ſay, your father will not have any objection to take you to it; but were you now to go, your pleaſure would be interrupted by the recollection that you are doing wrong, and the fear of being found out. You may meet ſomebody you know; or twenty things that you do not think of may happen to diſcover it to Sir John."</p>
               <p>"What a coward you are, Charles," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Edward; "you have no ſpirit, you are ſuch a chicken-hearted fellow"—</p>
               <p>"I have ſpirit enough, Edward, when I know my cauſe is good"—</p>
               <p>"Well," interrupted the young gentleman, "I am ſure this is not a bad cauſe: as I told you before, if it was matter of conſequence, I ſhould be more ſcrupulous; but what harm can there be in taking Lightfoot for a few hours? You know I have rode Mr. Shepherd's black Caeſar before now, and I am ſure he had ſpirit enough."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="unknown:030966_0110_0FEA0D47E374CC28"/>
"You are deceiving your parents, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward," returned Charles, "and you muſt allow there is harm in that; but it does not ſignify arguing, if you are bent upon going, I cannot prevent you; but I aſſure you I ſhall, on no account whatever, think of going with you."</p>
               <p>"Nay, now, my dear Charles," ſaid Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, "I do not often aſk a favour of you—Do oblige me this once, I will never again, I promiſe, deſire you to do a thing without my father's knowledge."</p>
               <p>"This is always the way," returned Charles; "you know it hurts me to refuſe any requeſt you make, and you take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of my weakneſs. You have drawn me into many things againſt my inclination, but I am determined not to be prevailed upon in this: it is ſuch a wicked thing to deceive your parents, and to draw the ſervants in to tell lies—I am ſurpriſed you can think of it."</p>
               <p>"There will be no occaſion," returned Edward," to tell any lies; we ſhall be back long enough before either father or mother returns. Now, Charles, I have done many things to oblige you; do not deny me ſuch a trifle: There will be no other review be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we go to ſchool, and I have ſet my heart upon ſeeing one."</p>
               <p>"Say no more, my dear Edward, you
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:030966_0111_0FEA0D4A371FCD18"/>
know it diſtreſſes me to diſoblige you; but indeed I cannot countenance you in ſuch a bad action: Do, let me entreat you, think no more of this wicked ſcheme."</p>
               <p>"Look you, Charles," ſaid Edward, "all you can ſay will be to no purpoſe: I am de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſee the review, whether you go or not; ſo it will make no difference in that reſpect, only I ſhall in future know how far I ought to rely on your friendſhip: As long as you can keep your neck out of the nooſe, you do not care what becomes of me."</p>
               <p>This laſt obſervation piqued the pride, and wounded the friendſhip of our hero, who began to utter his refuſals with leſs confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Edward perceived it, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſolicit, till Charles, notwithſtanding all he had ſaid, was weak enough to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, and actually conſented to accompany him.</p>
               <p>George, the ſtable-boy, was prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with a bribe of half a crown, to attend them, and to keep the ſecret, and our two young gentlemen, the one on Lightfoot, and the other on the black poney, ſet forward on their</p>

               <p>Edward, who, no more than his friend, had, been much accuſtomed to ride on horſeback, tho' extremely elated with his ſtation, found
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:030966_0112_0FEA0D4C9ED23688"/>
ſome difficulty in keeping it; Lightfoot being a very ſpirited horſe, and not much accuſtomed to the tight rein; however, by the directions of George, he managed to keep his ſeat, and arrived in high ſpirits at Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heath. But here a diſappointment a waited them; the review they underſtood was defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, owing to the indiſpoſition of ſome of the Royal Family, who were to be preſent. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was much diſconcerted; as alſo was his companion, who, notwithſtanding the uneaſy ſenſations he felt from acting ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his principles, would not have been diſpleaſed, as he had gone thus far, to behold an exhibition entirely new to him; but they were fain to ſubmit.</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid Edward, having comment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their ill luck, "we will not come thus far for nothing: George, do you think you can find a houſe were we may have ſome refreſhment?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Sir," replied George; "there is one juſt acroſs the heath, beyond that cluſter of trees, where any thing may be had, if you have money."</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes," ſaid Edward, "I will find money." Saying this, he gave Lightfoot a touch with the whip, and away they all went. "Well," ſaid Edward, recovering his ſpirits, which the diſappointment had ſomewhat damped, "this is delightful! I
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:030966_0113_0FEA0D4EF769E9C0"/>
am glad we came; it is worth ſomething to ride Lightfoot! Charles could not forbear thinking the pleaſure was purchaſed very dearly, and was juſt going to reply, when Edward exclaimed, upon ſeeing two youths advance, "I do think here is Maſter Jones, the ſon of my fathers tenants! How do you do, my dear William," ſaid he, finding he was not miſtaken, "what can have brought you here?"</p>
               <p>Maſter Jones enquired reſpectfully after Sir John and Lady Bentley, and replied, that he was at ſchool at Lewiſham.</p>
               <p>"But it is holiday time," ſaid Edward.</p>
               <p>"My father," returned Maſter Jones, "lives ſo far off, that I have holidays only once a year."</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid Edward, "I am delighted to have met you. We came to ſee the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, but finding it is put off, are going to take ſome refreſhment. You and this young gentleman ſhall go with us—I inſiſt upon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t."</p>
               <p>"We are much obliged to you, Maſter Bent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley," returned the young gentleman, "but we cannot ſtay without our Maſter's know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; we came out merely for a walk."</p>
               <p>"My ſervant," ſaid Edward, "ſhall go, and tell where you are; and then, I dare ſay, he will not be angry."</p>
               <p>The young gentlman readily, upon theſe conditions, conſented, and George was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:030966_0114_0FEA0D512E762658"/>
to Lewiſham, while our party, highly pleaſed with their rencounter, proceeded acroſs the heath. Edward, who now felt himſelf of great conſequence, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted at the inn, and giving his horſe to the care of the hoſtler, entered with an air of importance, ordered a fire to be lighted in the beſt room, and ſomething to be dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as expeditiouſly as poſſible for dinner. Theſe orders were preſently executed, and the young gentlemen, mutually pleaſed with each other, ſet down to a couple of fine fowls and cuſtards. The cloth being removed, Charles took an opportunity of reminding his friend, that it would be prudent to think of returning; but Edward declared, he was determined to make out the day, for he knew his father and mother would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn till late in the evening, and as to the painter he might go to Guinea.</p>
               <p>Charles was going to expoſtulate, but Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, turning to his new companions, "What ſay you, my boys," ſaid he, "to a game at cards?"</p>
               <p>All, but Charles, ſeemed highly to approve the motion; but he, ſenſible of the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, once more drew his friend aſide to expoſtulate; Indeed, Edward, ſaid he, you had better not ſet down to cards, you know, how time paſſes, we had better go home: For my part, I have had no peace ſince I
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:030966_0115_0FEA0D551A087978"/>
have been out, and I am ſure, I ſhall have none till I get home.</p>
               <p>"You are a cowardly fellow," ſaid Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, "I tell you, there is plenty of time, we ſhall be home long enough before my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and mother."</p>
               <p>Saying this he broke from Charles, and calling for cards, began to ſettle the preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries of the game.</p>
               <p>"For my part," ſaid Charles, "I would prefer to ſet by, and look on; you know, Edward, I am not very partial to cards, and you are going to play higher than I can af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford."</p>
               <p>"What a ſtingy fellow you are, Charles," ſaid Edward, "to be afraid of looſing your money."</p>
               <p>"I am not ſtingy," returned Charles, "but I ſhould be ſorry to looſe more money than I could pay."</p>
               <p>"O, never fear," replied Edward, "I will help you out; but I know you will win."</p>
               <p>"I neither wiſh to win nor loſe," ſaid Charles; "but, unable to withſtand the half ſmile of ridicule, which he obſerved on the faces of his companions, he ſat down with the reſt, though it was to ſtake part of the money he had appropriated to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of poor Catherine. At firſt he won, but, as is generally the caſe, his fortune, at

length, took a turn, and he not only loſt all he had gained, but a conſiderable part of the money he had promiſed to poor Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine: this thought made him deſperate; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>in proportion as he loſt, his eagerneſs to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the game encreaſed: his life or death ſeemed attached to every card: he no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er watched the ſun, nor perceived that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined faſt towards the weſt: regardleſs of the conſequences, he thought only of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the money he had loſt, and which he conſidered the property of another."</p>
               <p>Maſter Jones and his friend, however, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the evening come on apace, at length, took their leave; declaring they dared not ſtay any longer, and Edward himſelf thought it neceſſary to call for the bill: contrary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> to his expectation, it amounted to more than his pocket could diſcharge. In this dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, he applied to his friend Charles, who, with a pang not to be expreſſed, but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not more ſevere than his imprudence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, diſburſed the laſt remaining ſeven ſhillings of the guinea and a half he had ſo faithfully promiſed, before night, to carry to poor Catherine! As for Edward, as long as he had it, it ſignified nothing to him where it came from, he paid the reckoning, and mounting his horſe thought only of getting home as faſt as poſſible. Charles, alſo, once more aſcended the black poney, and with a

heavy heart followed his friend. Though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſably imprudent, he had not an unfeeling heart; the thought, therefore, of diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poor creature, to whom he had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en hopes, and who looked up to him as her only reſource, filled his mind with unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able anguiſh, and he continued his way, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed in the moſt gloomy reflections, till rouſed by his companion, who ſuddenly checked his horſe, and exclaimed, "O heaven, Charles! what will become of me? I have loſt my father's diamond ring!"</p>
               <p>This was like a thunder bolt to Charles; he was willing to hope, he had not heard right; till his friend added, "fly George, fly, ſee if it be not left at the inn."</p>
               <p>George needed not this command to be repeated, he ſpurred his horſe, and was out of ſight in an inſtant.</p>
               <p>"Feel in your waiſtcoat pocket," ſaid Charles, "perhaps it may luckily have fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from your finger there."</p>
               <p>"No," returned Edward, "it is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt, unleſs you have picked it up."</p>
               <p>"I!" ſaid Charles, "I never ſaw it but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your hand at dinner, and I thought more than once to aſk, whether Sir John or my lady, had given it you."</p>
               <p>"No," ſaid Edward, "I ſaw it juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſet out lie upon my mother's dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:030966_0118_0FEA0D5B65F3E1A0"/>
table, and it unluckily came into my head that I would put it on."</p>
               <p>"How could you be ſo imprudent!" ſaid Charles.</p>
               <p>"Indeed," returned Edward, "I cannot tell what poſſeſſed me, nothing could ever be ſo unlucky, I never in my life before thought of ſuch a thing—Dear, what a time George ſtays! one might have been twice there and back before now—let us go and meet him—O here he is."</p>
               <p>By this time George was come up, and his ſorrowful countenance bore ſufficient te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony to the ill ſucceſs of his embaſſy: the ring was not to be found.</p>
               <p>The reader may eaſily form an idea of the diſtreſs of the whole party upon this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of their misfortune: Edward, who, on every occaſion, was accuſtomed to follow the bent of his paſſions, was quite frantic, and declared that he dared not ſee his father without the ring, which he knew he particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly valued, on account of its once belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his grand-mother. Charles' feelings were not leſs acute, though unwilling to add to the diſtreſs of his friend, he confined them within his own breaſt: George, too, was not the leaſt affected upon this occaſion; ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the blame would fall heavy upon him for taking the horſes out without Sir John's orders, he was equally alarmed at an event
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:030966_0119_0FEA0D5FE9C99608"/>
that threatened a diſcovery, and ventured to reprove his young maſter: "La! ſir," ſaid he, "how could you think of taking my maſter's ring! what ſhall we do—I am ſure I ſhall loſe my place; and that will be very hard for my good nature—if it had not been for the ring,"—</p>
               <p>"Well," interrupted the young gentleman impatiently, "talking is of no uſe now; the ring is loſt, and there is an end of it."</p>
               <p>A ſilence of ſome minutes now enſued, and our travellers, with a ſlow pace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded homeward; each reflecting with bitterneſs on the ſhare he had in the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. As for Charles, this unexpected mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune had entirely baniſhed all thoughts of poor Catherine, and the reſentment of his patron was the only object that now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented itſelf to his mind. Edward, in the mean while, who had been revolving all the circumſtances in his mind, at length broke ſilence: "I tell you what, Charles," ſaid he, "the beſt way to get out of the ſcrape, will be to deny that we know any thing of the ring."</p>
               <p>"To deny it!" ſaid Charles, with aſtoniſhment; "to deny it! can you think of ſuch a thing?"</p>
               <p>"Why," returned Edward, "I am ſure, if my father knows the ring is loſt, I ſhall never hear the laſt of it."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="117" facs="unknown:030966_0120_0FEA0D62C2B74448"/>
"But what can be ſo bad," ſaid Charles, "as the ſtanding in ſuch a falſehood? you ſaid, when you prevailed on me to come with you on this imprudent excurſion, that, were it a matter of conſequence, you would be more ſcrupulous in deceiving your father."</p>
               <p>"Well, well," interrupted Edward, impatiently, "to be ſure I did ſo; but I did not then think I ſhould ever have been in ſuch a ſcrape; deſperate diſeaſes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire deſperate remedies—and, my father's knowing who loſt the ring, will not bring it back."</p>
               <p>"Very true, maſter Edward," ſaid George, "and if he knows about the ring, all muſt come out, and I ſhall loſe my place, which will be very hard for my good-nature; for you know, Maſter Edward, I did it all purely to oblige you."</p>
               <p>"You are very wrong George," ſaid Charles, "to encourage Maſter Edward, in any thing ſo wicked; we have certainly all done wrong, but let us not attempt to excuſe one fault by committing a greater: The only thing we can do now, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs all, and, ſubmit to what puniſhment Sir John thinks fit to inflict. I aſſure you, Edward, I will not aſſent to ſuch a falſehood."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="unknown:030966_0121_0FEA0D6514D37778"/>
"Well," returned Edward, if it will give you pleaſure to make a breach between my father and I—if—"</p>
               <p>"I am certain," interrupted Charles, "that you have a father too indulgent to be in any fear of that ſort; though he will, no doubt, be diſpleaſed, he will not be ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcilable."</p>
               <p>"I know my father," returned the young gentleman, "better than you do; he is very indulgent, when I do nothing to diſpleaſe him, but if I do, he is very paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate, and I know will puniſh me with the greateſt ſeverity; but I ſee it will give you pleaſure to make me miſerable."</p>
               <p>"Nay," ſaid Charles, "you know I incur the ſame danger as you: the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sir John will fall equally upon me; but I aſſure you, I would rather ſuffer every thing than tell ſuch an unpardonable falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
               <p>"As you are ſo very conſcientious, Charles," ſaid Edward, "there is one way that you may oblige me, and yet avoid tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling a lie: you know the ring was never off my finger, ſo you may ſafely ſay, when my father aſks you, that you never <hi>touched</hi> it, that will not be a lie."</p>
               <p>"My dear Edward," ſaid Charles "an equivocation is the very firſt ſpecies of lying; becauſe, as my father has often
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:030966_0122_0FEA0D6840BCA4F8"/>
told me, it is covering falſehood with the moſt plauſible reſemblance of truth: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we may flatter ourſelves, he uſed to ſay, that we do not incur the diſpleaſure of God by this ſort of play upon words; the lie is already formed in our heart, upon which he looketh, and equivocation is only a more ſpecious method of impoſing it upon others. It is true, according to the literal ſenſe of the word, I might ſafely tell Sir John, I did not <hi>touch</hi> the ring; but if by this, I mean to convey that I know nothing of it, I am equally a liar, as if the ſame idea were conveyed in different words."</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid Edward, impatiently, "it is not a time to preach now: I ſee you are determined not to oblige me—but I know the reaſon: you ſaid no longer ago than yeſterday, that you had forgot all paſt differences, but I ſee now that you are glad to retaliate, and would rather get into a ſcrape yourſelf, than not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged."</p>
               <p>This was a turn Charles little expected; he indeed repeatedly ſuffered from the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent and arbitrary temper of Edward; but ſuch was the affection he entertained for him, that a kind look, a word of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, was ever ſufficient to efface from his mind every trace of reſentment or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure; he was therefore, inexpreſſibly
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:030966_0123_0FEA0D6B6DD1FB00"/>
hurt that his friend ſhould ſuſpect that he was actuated by ſo mean a motive, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to convince him that he acted from a diſintereſted regard to truth, which he had been taught to venerate as the baſis of every virtue. Edward, who was not without art, perceiving his ſuſpicions touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to the quick, pretended to be but the more confirmed in them, thinking it would be the moſt effectual means to attain his ends.</p>
               <p>"Yes, yes," ſaid he, "I ſee you are glad to retaliate; I relied too much on your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions: It is true, I may not be able to boaſt of a temper, at all times, ſo equal as yours; but Charles could not ſeriouſly have aſked a favour, that I could have refuſed: my temper may be warm, perhaps violent, but I am equally warm in my attachments, I cannot be a cool friend."</p>
               <p>"I am not a cool friend," replied Charles, with tears in his eyes, "I am ſure, Edward, you never found me ſo: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y my friendſhip in any thing that will render you a real ſervice, and you ſhall ſee with what readineſs I will prove it, at all hazards."</p>
               <p>"O!" ſaid Edward, with a ſneer, "it is eaſy to be bold when danger is afar off: I aſk the proof now, and from henceforth ſhall know the value I ought to ſet on your friendſhip."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="unknown:030966_0124_0FEA0D6D01B437E0"/>
"What would you have me do?" ſaid Charles, who was weak enough to be moved by his friend's pretended ſuſpicions; "'tis true, it is not the firſt time, I have been ſo weak as to be prevailed upon by your entreaties, to enter into things that I knew were wrong; but this is of ſuch ſerious conſequence, indeed, I cannot; beſide, when we have told this falſehood, do you ſuppoſe your father will believe we know nothing of the ring?"</p>
               <p>"O!" ſaid Edward, "'tis a hundred to one if he miſſes it; he does not wear it once in ſeven years: he will think it has been ſwept away, or that he has loſt it off his finger; for I heard him ſay, the laſt time he wore it, it was ſo large he could ſcarcely keep it on; but, however, if your friendſhip will not ſuffer you to make ſo ſmall a ſacrifice—I can only ſay, it cannot be very ſtrong, and that I ſhall, in future, know how to value it."</p>
               <p>Charles really entertained the ſincereſt friendſhip for the ſon of his patron; this was piqued by the pretended ſuſpicions of the artful boy; who, obſerving that he began to utter his refuſals with a leſs reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute tone of voice, took advantage of his weakneſs, and by dints of entreaties and tears, though he did not convince his reaſon, worked ſo far upon his affection, that, in
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:030966_0125_0FEA0D6F14C3A0C8"/>
the end, his integrity gave way, and I am aſhamed to ſay, he conſented to connive at the falſehood his friend had projected.</p>
               <p>The reader will judge, that the uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the whole party encreaſed the nearer they drew toward home; the day had for ſome time cloſed, and they were alarmed, leſt Sir John and his lady were returned: However, their fears on this head, were ſoon diſſipated, neither of them were at home, and Edward learnt, with great ſatisfaction, that the portrait painter had ſent to put off his attendance till the next day: he exulted extremely upon the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſo far recovered his ſpirits, as to banter Charles a great deal upon his cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice. "I told you," ſaid he, "we ſhould come off ſafe; I dare ſay, my father will not be at home this hour." He was however deceived in his calculation; for Sir John and Lady Bentley arrived within a quarter of an hour: Charles, who was but young in the art of deceiving, ſickened at the thought of meeting Sir John; he, therefore, took the firſt opportunity of ſneaking to his chamber, where, with grief and vexation, he called to mind all the</p>

               <head>EVENTS OF THE DAY.</head>
               <p>From the excurſion to Blackheath, he reflected on the loſs of the ring, and not with leſs bitterneſs on the loſs of his money: The ſituation of poor Catherine returned freſh to his remembrance: "I am the only friend," ſaid he, "to whom ſhe can look in her diſtreſs: I have pledged myſelf to aſſiſt her, ſhe is, without doubt, now liſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning anxiouſly to every foot, in hopes 'tis mine. What a diſappointment, when ſhe finds I do not come! What a wretch I muſt appear! Who knows, perhaps ſhe may think I meant to make a jeſt of her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. I have heard of ſuch things; and all this is through my own folly; what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion had I to play at cards with money that was not my own? for it certainly was not, when I had promiſed it to another perſon. What can I do? if I could but borrow the money! but it is vain to think of that, for I know Edward has not a ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence left. What can I do?—If I could but think of a way to raiſe it! if I had but any thing I could ſell for the money—my watch—but that will be miſſed directly; and beſides, where can I ſell it—I ſuppoſe it is not cuſtomary for ſhop-keepers to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe ſuch things—and yet poor Catherine,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:030966_0127_0FEA0D74B1FD4978"/>
one would almoſt hazard every thing to keep one's word.—It is ſo ſhameful, ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human, to give her hopes, and then diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point them. But what will Sir John ſay, when he ſees me without the watch he ſo generouſly gave me? What can I ſay? he will certainly miſs it—ſuppoſe I have ſent it to be mended—but that will be a falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood—I am already involved in one—I am grown very wicked! what would my father ſay! And yet poor Catherine! The watch, I am ſure, coſt four guineas—if I could ſell it for two, I could keep my word, and at leaſt eaſe my mind of one burthen—I am almoſt tempted; the holidays are now nearly half elapſed: Sir John may not miſs the watch—and then, I will ſave every farthing I get for pocket money, to replace it before the next—I will get up early to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow morning, and go into the firſt watch-makers I come to; if I can ſell it, I will—I muſt not think of the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces—I am very miſerable, one would hardly think how many faults one falſe ſtep leads one to commit! There is Sir John's ring—but I will think no more, I have promiſed Edward, and I muſt keep my word." Saying this, Charles undreſſed himſelf, and went to bed, but the anxiety of his mind kept him long awake, the night was far ſpent before he fell aſleep. Morning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:030966_0128_0FEA0D76B02F53C0"/>
his cares, and he began afreſh to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve the project of the watch—ſometimes he thought of going to Catherine and acknowledging the truth, but this meaſure his pride forbad—then he thought of writing, but that was as irkſome—in ſhort, reflection only involved him in freſh per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity; the watch was at laſt doomed, and Charles repaired with it to a ſhop; where, with a confuſion that did not eſcape obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, he offered to ſell it. The watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, having looked attentively on Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, and then on the watch, aſked what he demanded." Charles replied, "that he thought it worth three guineas; but was very glad to take two and half, which the ſhop-keeper offered. With this, he haſtened to Catherine; and putting a guinea and a half into her hand, "There, Catherine," ſaid he, "is the money; I am ſorry I diſappointed you laſt night, but I could not help it."</p>
               <p>Poor Catherine's eyes ſparkled with joy; ſhe called him her preſerver—her good angel, and could not find words to expreſs her gratitude.</p>
               <p>"I hope," ſaid Charles, "that it will anſwer the purpoſe you wiſh, and that it may pleaſe God to reſtore you." Then, diſengaging himſelf as ſoon as poſſible, he proceeded homeward. The happineſs he
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:030966_0129_0FEA0D7A12CA0348"/>
had communicated to poor Catherine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed ſuch joy to his heart, that for a time he ſeemed to forget the means he had taken to procure it, as alſo the diſagreeable buſineſs in which he was involved with Edward. He ſauntered on, enjoying the coolneſs of the morning, till, in paſſing a ſhop-window, his eye was inſenſibly, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by the prettieſt etui he had ever ſeen.</p>
               <p>"What a Charming preſent," ſaid Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les, "that would be for my mother! if I had but money to purchaſe it: but there is the vexation," continued he, with a ſigh, "without money, one cannot come at any thing." Then Charles began to think of the guinea that remained of the ſum he had gained for the watch: This he had firmly reſolved to hoard carefully, and to add to it every penny he could get, till he had accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulated ſufficient to replace Sir John's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; nevertheleſs he was tempted to go in and aſk the price of the etui. It was eight ſhillings: Charles thought it too much; but when the ſhopkeeper aſſured him it was a very great bargain, and ſhewed him others of higher price, which in his opinion, were not half ſo pretty, his reſolution was ſhaken; he began to reflect that it would not be ſo very difficult to raiſe the value of the watch he wiſhed to replace, even though he ſhould
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:030966_0130_0FEA0D7CA4CBD490"/>
purchaſe the etui: "In a few days," ſaid he, "I ſhall viſit my god-mother, who never fails to make me a preſent; and Sir John, I am certain, will not ſuffer me to leave town without marks of his genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; then there will be my weekly allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, I can ſave that." In ſhort, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed the etui: and, while the ſhopkeeper was counting out the change, his eye was unfortunately caught by a pretty little net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-caſe. His ſiſter Mary, who was a great netter, immediately was preſent to his mind; it was impoſſible to reſiſt—the net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-caſe was purchaſed; but Charles would not have left the ſhop quite pennyleſs, had not a ſmall pocket-caſe of inſtruments for drawing attracted his notice. This could not be reſiſted; it was ſo ſmall—ſo neat—ſo compact—the very thing he wanted. The watch was for the moment forgotten, and the caſe of Inſtruments added to the etui and netting-caſe.</p>
               <p>"Though Sir John Bentley poſſeſſed one of the moſt humane and benevolent hearts in the world, his manners were auſtere and reſerved. It ſo happened, that on this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, upon the appearance of Charles at the breakfeſt-table, he addreſſed him with a greater ſhare of complacency than uſual: ſuch is the effect of guilt, that Charles could not ſummon reſolution to look his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:030966_0131_0FEA0D7F1B7AD9E0"/>
in the face: Every kind word Sir John addreſſed to him, ſeemed a reproach to his diſſimulation; every time he met his eye, it ſeemed to penetrate into his inmoſt thoughts. As for Edward, who was more hardened in vice, his feelings were leſs ſuſceptible: he exulted mightily in the thought of having ſo cleverly tricked his father: the ring indeed ſometimes gave him uneaſineſs, but then it was for fear the truth, by ſome unlucky accident, ſhould be diſcovered; as long as it remained concealed, he was happy; if it were poſſible for guilt to be ſo.</p>
               <p>"Things remained in this ſtate three days, during which time Charles heartily repented his imprudence, but fooliſhly thought that he had gone too far to retract: his conſcience continually upbraided him with his conduct, and he was in hourly fear of being interrogated concerning the ring or the watch, which laſt he reſolved to ſay he had ſent to the watchmakers to be ſet to rights. The dreadful moment, however, at length arrived; Charles was ſent for into the ſtudy of Sir John, which he entered with a beating heart, though with more confidence than uſual. Let the reader judge how every fear was awakened, when he perceived there the very man to whom he had ſold the watch, and the iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:030966_0132_0FEA0D80DD690998"/>
watch in the hand of Sir John! The perſon to whom Charles had ſold the watch was the very ſame of whom Sir John had purchaſed it. The watchmaker knew the watch, and obſerving the confuſion of Charles, whom he had frequently obſerved paſs his ſhop, in company with Maſter Bentley, when he offered it to ſale, ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſomething more was in the matter than Sir John knew: unwilling however, to proceed on uncertain grounds, he reſolved to pay the price, and keep the watch till he had an audience with Sir John, who, the reader will conclude, was much ſurpriſed at the unfolding</p>

               <head>THE AFFAIR.</head>
               <p>The firſt queſtion that naturally aroſe from the ſubject, when the culprit appeared before him, was the cauſe of a proceeding ſo extraordinary? Charles could make no reply, but ſhame and confuſion were ſtrongly pictured in his countenance. Sir John repeated the queſtion, but Charles was ſtill ſilent; the fear of bringing Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine into trouble for having received ſuch a ſum, without the knowledge of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or patron, made him prefer any ſubter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge to that noble candour, which alone could have excuſed his errors. Being no
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:030966_0133_0FEA0D8330D78A40"/>
longer able to oppoſe ſilence to the repeated interrogations of Sir John, he replied, "That he met a poor woman in the ſtreet, and that he aſſiſted her with part of the money." "But," replied Sir John, "three days ago you had, to my knowledge, a guinea and a half in your purſe; you could therefore have followed the dictates of humanity without making ſuch a ſacrifice: What did you do with that money?" This was a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion Charles did not expect, and was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared to anſwer, without divulging the expedition to Blackheath. He heſitated—he did not know what to ſay—and at laſt produced the etui, the caſe of inſtruments, and the netting-box.</p>
               <p>"Sir John was extremely diſpleaſed: "I fear, Charles," ſaid he, "I have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the opinion I firſt formed of you; for a boy who can, unpreſſed by neceſſity, proceed to ſuch lengths, muſt neceſſarily be unbounded in his deſires, and conſequently unworthy my countenance and protection."</p>
               <p>"Charles threw himſelf at the feet of his benefactor, and entreated to be forgiven; but Sir John, highly incenſed at his conduct left the room with indignation, and from that time behaved towards Charles with a coolneſs and reſerve that wounded him in the tendereſt part; as it convinced him he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

opinion of his patron. Nor was this all; the ſtory of the watch was circulated through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole houſe and indeed the whole neighbourhood: every one cenſured him; every one exclaimed againſt his ingratitude, in ſetting ſo little value upon a watch the gift of his benefactor; and ſuſpected, as he had diſcovered ſuch a want of principle in one inſtance, that other faults of the ſame nature remained behind, yet undiſcovered. Charles now ſincerely repented his folly, but was ſtill weak enough to believe he had gone too far to retract. All he had cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to do was, repeatedly, to ſolicit Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to acknowledge the expedition to Blackheath, and its conſequences reſpecting the ring; but Edward, encouraged by its remaining ſo long concealed, was deaf to his entreaties; and to confeſs the truth, Charles himſelf was ſo much intimidated by the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace he had already ſuffered, that he had not courage to preſs his friend home to a confeſſion, which he was ſenſible muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve him in further. A fortnight elapſed before the dreadful time of enquiry arrived; but the ring was then miſſed, the ſervants interrogated, and every corner of the houſe ſearched.</p>
               <p>"The queſtion of enquiry was then put to our two young gentlemen: Edward, I am ſhocked to relate, declared with a firm

voice and unbluſhing cheek, that he had not ſeen the ring, nor knew even the place where it was kept. Charles did the ſame; but that agitation, which will ever be the attendant on guilt, where the heart is not wholly corrupt, joined to the ill opinion entertained of him on account of his late diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, conſpired to fix the ſuſpicions on him. Sir John, judging from the affair of the watch, was perſuaded he had either loſt or ſold the ring; and having in vain endeavoured to draw from him the truth, confined him to his chamber, with orders that he ſhould have no other food than bread and water, till he confeſſed. Edward's fears were, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this occaſion, ſeriouſly awakened: he doubted not but Charles would now be brought to diſcover the whole, and repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed having ſo ſtrenuouſly denied the truth, which he was ſenſible would incenſe his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther more than the fault itſelf: he reſolved, therefore, to exert the influence he well knew he poſſeſſed over his friend, to prevent the conſequences he ſo much dreaded. With this view, he went with him; and having condoled with him on his diſgrace, aſſured him, if he could have thought his father would have laid the blame on him, he would have confeſſed the truth at firſt; but he add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that now he had ſo ſtrenuouſly denied it, he could not recant without incenſing his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:030966_0136_0FEA0D8AB94627B8"/>
to the laſt degree. By theſe artful a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologies, he ſo far won upon Charles, that he was weak enough to perſiſt in the falſehood, the diſcovery of which, Edward artfully hinted, would not only ruin him, and more deeply involved himſelf, but alſo ruin poor George, who had acted entirely from his perſuaſions.</p>
               <p>"In the mean while, Sir John having advertiſed the ring in the public papers, without ſucceſs, fully convinced that Charles was no ſtranger to its fate, reſolved, ſince neither the puniſhment he had inflicted, nor the entreaties he uſed, would induce him to diſcover the truth, to try what effect the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of being diſmiſſed his family would produce; a meaſure which he adopted the more readily, as the conduct of Charles, in this inſtance and in that of the watch, made him appear by no means a proper compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion for his ſon.</p>
               <p>"Words cannot deſcribe the feelings of Charles upon this occaſion: the thought of being thus ſhamefully diſmiſſed the family of his patron, operated ſo forcibly on his mind, that he reſolved, let the conſequence be what it would, to confeſs every thing.—He was making his way with this deſign to Sir John's ſtudy, when, in croſſing the hall, he unfortunately encountered Edward, who ſtopped to enquire whither he was going in
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:030966_0137_0FEA0D8D18FA8418"/>
ſuch haſte? Charles, with a ſorrowful countenance, owned, that, unable longer to ſupport the diſpleaſure of Sir John, he was actually going to confeſs the truth.</p>
               <q rend="inline normQuotes">
                  <p>Edward, much alarmed at this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, by his tears and entreaties, once more ſhook the reſolution of his friend. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him, for his ſake, to be ſilent, at leaſt for the preſent; aſſuring him that he would endeavour to ſoften the reſentment of his father, and at proper opportunity acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the truth. Charles was, as uſual, ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened—he wept—he expoſtulated—but in the end yielded; and, with an aching heart, ſet out a few hours after in the ſtage coach for the peaceful manſion of his father, at which he arrived toward evening the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day.</p>
                  <p>How delicious would have been the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of his honoured parents—his beloved ſiſters—had Charles been conſcious of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving them! but guilt can poiſon the pureſt pleaſures.</p>
                  <p>Mr. and Mrs. Weldon, alarmed at the ſettled gloom that appeared on the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of their ſon, enquired earneſtly after the health and welfare of the family he had left, and were much relieved when aſſured they were well: but when Charles, burſting into tears, delivered a letter, with which he was charged by Sir John, a thouſand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming conjectures were in an inſtant form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:030966_0138_0FEA0D90904490E8"/>
Among them, the miſconduct of their beloved Charles never once occurred. Let the reader then judge what they felt, when informed it had been ſuch, that, for the ſake of his ſon's <hi>morals,</hi> Sir John could no longer think of continuing Charles at the ſame ſchool; though, to ſoften the ſtroke, he added, he would defray the expence of his education, at any other his father ſhould chuſe.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Weldon read this letter, with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion better felt than deſcribed. Had Charles loſt the countenance of his patron upon any other occaſion, he could have borne it with fortitude; but this baffled all his phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy: he threw himſelf into a chair, pale and trembling, and bending an eye of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry on his ſon, ſeemed to demand the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation he wiſhed, yet dreaded to hear.</p>
                  <p>Charles, when he left London, had by the advice of Edward, formed the reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of keeping the truth concealed from his family; but though he had withſtood the reproaches of his conſcience, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace of being diſmiſſed the family of his patron, he could not the diſtreſs of his father: he threw himſelf in an agony at his feet, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced his knees, and as diſtinctly as the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his mind would permit, gave a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail of the unfortunate expedition to Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heath, with all its attendant conſequences.</p>

"Unhappy boy," ſaid Mr. Weldon, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liſtened attentively to the detail, "the flexibility of your temper has undone you. Into what a labyrinth of diſgrace has it not plunged you!"</p>
               <p>"O father," ſaid Charles, in a voice in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by tears, "I ſee my errors; but it is now too late: I have loſt the favour of Sir John—diſgraced myſelf in the opinion of every one—made you miſerable—." He could ſay no more.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Weldon perceived, and even piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his anguiſh;" you have indeed, my child, ſaid he, "done all this: it remains only now, to make all the reparation in your power: Sir John muſt immediately be acquainted with the truth; the</p>

               <p>"O father," interrupted Charles, "in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I cannot acquaint Sir John—I have promiſed Edward—I have ſuffered a great deal for his ſake—and after all, to betray him! indeed, father, I cannot."</p>
               <p>"Truth," ſaid Mr. Weldon, "is the only reparation you can now make, and you owe it equally to Sir John—your friend Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward—and yourſelf."—</p>
               <p>"Edward," ſaid Charles, "would, I am ſure, never forgive me! he had denied it ſo often to Sir John—it would ſo expoſe him."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="unknown:030966_0140_0FEA0D949E074180"/>
"If Edward," ſaid Mr. Weldon, "ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in concealing this fault, it will encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage him to commit greater; from one ſtep he will proceed to another till, in the end, he will not ſtop at the worſt of crimes. Would you, Charles, to ſave your friend a momentary chagrine, expoſe him to a ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous evil?"</p>
               <p>"I am ſure, father," replied Charles, "if Edward has ſuffered the tenth part of what I have, he will never more be guilty of a falſehood—if I had but confeſſed the truth before I left London, I ſhould have been happy—but now, indeed, father, I cannot; it will appear juſt as if I had left Edward to bear the whole weight of Sir John's diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and had neither courage nor friendſhip to ſhare it with him."</p>
               <p>"I will not ſay," replied Mr. Weldon, "that it may not have that appearance, but the mortification you may ſuffer, on this, and every other point, is a juſt puniſhment for the obſtinacy with which you perſiſted in the falſehood you had once told."</p>
               <p>"But Father,"—</p>
               <p>"Say no more," ſaid Mr. Weldon, "in a tone of authority, that had never yet failed to excite the obedience of his ſon, no time is now to be loſt; the poſt ſets out at nine, and truth, as I obſerved before, is the only atonement you can now make for your paſt errors."</p>

"Charles ventured not to reply; he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his father in ſilence to the ſtudy, where, being furniſhed with pen and ink, he ſat down, and with a trembling hand, wrote a circumſtantial account of the train of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, that had brought on his preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace; generouſly taking every opportunity in the courſe of the narrative to palliate (tho' frequently at his own expence,) the faults of his friend. This letter was immediately diſpatched to Sir John, and Charles, though in other reſpects, eaſed of a burden that had long oppreſſed his heart, was for a week, on Edward's account, a prey to very pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſenſations; at length, one day, as he ſtood at a window that looked into the road, he ſaw a coach, which he knew to be that of his benefactor, draw up to the gate. Sir John alighted, followed by his ſon, and was received by Mr. Weldon and his Lady, with every mark of reſpect and friendſhip, though the recollection of their ſon's diſgrace, gave a check to that cheerfulneſs, which his preſence uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſpired."</p>
               <p>Charles, alone, wanted courage to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, till Sir John, compaſſionating his em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment and confuſion, encouraged him by a ſmile of invitation.</p>
               <p>"Ah, Sir," ſaid he, "with diffidence, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching, my faults are too great to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given:

I am unworthy—" and here he ſtopped.</p>
               <p>"As I am willing," ſaid Sir John, "to believe your repentance ſincere, and although late, you have made for your errors, all the atonement in your power, by an avowal of the truth, I will not add to thoſe ſtings, guilt will ever bring along with it, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches: I will do more, I will endeavour to forget the paſt, ſo ſaying, he held out his hand to him, in token of reconciliation."</p>
               <p>"Ah, Sir," ſaid Charles, "I am unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy this goodneſs: I am entirely unworthy of it: it wounds me more than the ſevereſt reproaches. Then turning to his friend, Edward, ſaid he, we have both done wrong—can you forgive me?"</p>
               <p>"Dear Charles," ſaid Edward, "embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him, I ought to aſk forgivneſs of you, I have led you into many errors: had it not been for me."—</p>
               <p>"Do not excuſe yourſelf," interrupted Charles, "I only am to blame; had I, with a proper firmneſs, reſiſted your ſolicitations, reflection would have recalled you to your duty."</p>
               <p>"You have been both to blame," ſaid Sir John, "but I hope your paſt errors will teach you the advantage, that truth will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have over falſehood: had you ſtopped at the firſt fault, how much diſgrace would

               <p>Sir John, then to the joy of all preſent, acquainted them, that he had recovered the diamond ring, which Edward had loſt, you have, without doubt, ſaid he, addreſſing Mr. and Mrs. Weldon, heard that I adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed it in the public papers: I gained no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation concerni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

As one of my prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal motives for wiſhing to recover the ring, was, that I might be enabled to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, by whom it had been detained, I made ſome enquiries, which led the woman to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me, that having ſhewn the ring to a man who kept a public houſe upon Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heath, he ſaid, he doubted not, but it was the ſame, two young gentlemen who ſpent the day at his houſe, a few days before, had loſt; and that he was perſuaded it would be advertiſed."</p>
               <p>"Reſolved," continued Sir John, "to purſue my enquiry further, I ſet out for Blackheath, and by the deſcription, the publican, at my requeſt, gave of the lads, to whom he alluded, I was perſuaded, I had been impoſed on by my ſon. I reproached him on my return, with his duplicity, and

drew from him a full confeſſion of his guilt."</p>
               <p>"You, my dear Weldon, who are your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a father, can alone judge, what I felt, when my ſuſpicions were changed into cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty."</p>
               <p>"Edward beheld the anguiſh of my mind; my ſufferings, I believe touched him; his tears flowed abundantly—I hope they were ſincere—but can we truſt him, who has once deceived us?"</p>
               <p>"O Father," ſaid Edward, burſting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tears, "my puniſhment is great; but is juſt; while I poſſeſſed your confidence, I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed it—I eſteemed it lightly; now, only that I have forever loſt, am I ſenſible of its true value."</p>
               <p>"Your conduct, Edward," ſaid Sir John, "has given to mine, and to your mother's heart, a wound, which time only, and your reformation can heal; in the hope of that, as much as poſſible, will we obliterate th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Charles and his friend, ſighed deeply; never were they before ſo completely hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; Charles eſpecially, whoſe feelings were more acute than thoſe of Edward, when he

reflected, how low his conduct had ſunk him in his own and in the opinion of all around him, was inexpreſſibly hurt, and in bitterneſs lamented his folly: "O my dear Edward," ſaid he, graſping the hand of his friend, "let us, from henceforth, invariably adhere to truth; let us be cautious of deviating in the ſmalleſt degree from the path of duty, out of which, I am convinced, there is no happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs."</p>
               <p>"Ah! Charles," replied Edward, "had I liſtened to your advice, we had both been happy."</p>
               <p>Sir John concluded, from the contrition that appeared in the countenance and expreſſions of his ſon and Charles, that his diſcourſe had made the impreſſion he wiſhed, entered upon other topics, and having chatted half an hour with Mr. and Mrs. Weldon, took his leave, telling Charles, at parting, to hold himſelf in readineſs, as Edward would ſet off for ſchool, in a few days. This hint, which ſignified to Charles, that he was to accompany his friend, joined to the thought, that a poſſibility ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of regaining one day, however diſtant, the confidence he had loſt, inſpired him with a joy, to which, ſince the moment of his tranſgreſſion, he had been a ſtranger. Two days after, his heart dilated with another pleaſure: Catherine, in a letter, ſhe addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

to Mrs. Weldon, ſetting forth her obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to Charles, acquainted her, that ſhe doubted not being able in a few weeks, to engage in a ſervice.</p>
               <p>This letter, communicated joy to every part of this worthy family, and to none more than to Charles, who, with pleaſure, ſaw a parcel made up from the wardrobe of his mother and ſiſters, diſpatched to her, with a little purſe, to which, each of the young ladies contributed to their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt.—</p>
               <p>The day in which the young gentlemen were to depart for ſchool, at length, arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; when Mr. Weldon addreſſed his ſon to this effect:—"My dear Charles, do not forget that your errors have originated from the inſtabiliy of your mind: had you poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that noble firmneſs, which, if not the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis, is the ſafe guard of every virtue, you would not, againſt your reaſon, and better judgment, have conſented to accompany your friend, upon an expedition, which your heart diſapproved: this expoſed you to a temptation, which was the conſequence of another error; I mean, that of riſquing, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your principle and inclination, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which being promiſed to another, was no longer your own; to repair this error, another was committed; your watch, the gift of your benefactor, was ſold, and to conceal this a lie followed."</p>

"But what ſhall I ſay to that weakneſs which led you, in complaiſance to another, to impoſe on your benefactor, by a lie, which though ever of a heinous nature, was, on this occaſion, aggravated: could you aſſure yourſelf, that the ſuſpicion of theft, might not fall upon an innocent perſon? Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately you was yourſelf, the victim of your weakneſs and duplicity: the mind of Sir John, already prepared by the myſtery that hung over the watch, readily entertained ſuſpicions to your diſadvantage: he believed you no ſtranger to the fate of his ring, and was perſuaded, if you had not taken it with an intent to wrong him, you had inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently loſt it, and were too obſtinate to own your fault. Your faultering voice, and guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty countenance, confirmed theſe ſuſpicions, and you were juſtly puniſhed, by a diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful diſmiſſion from the family.</p>
               <p>"A gentle and complying temper, my dear Charles, is amiable, but unleſs accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by diſcretion, will lead you, as you have proved by experience, into the moſt dangerous errors: to yield, where we know it is our duty to reſiſt, is a weakneſs for which it is difficult to form an excuſe: firſt, be aſſured that your principles are juſt, and then let it be your glory, to act in conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity to them—but, I ſee the coach at the door; adieu my dear boy; let my words

ſink deep into your heart, and remember, that the affection you entertain for a father, whoſe happineſs or miſery, it is in your pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in a great meaſure, to conſtitute, can only be proved by the rectitude of your fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conduct."</p>
               <p>Charles had ſcarcely time to aſſure his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he would treaſure his admonitions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was ſummoned to attend his friend Edward; he, therefore, in haſte, affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately embraced his father—his mother—his ſiſters—and departed for ſchool. There, by the rectitude of his conduct, he, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time, (for bad impreſſions are not eaſily effaced) obliterated, the remembrance of his former errors, regained the confidence of his patron, and became the pride of his parents, and the delight of all around him.</p>
               <p>Edward, too, purſuing the example of his friend, became eminent for his virtues, and found by experience that the higheſt happineſs is that of performing our duty.</p>

               <p>The next morning Mrs. Mills, having ſome buſineſs at a neighbouring farm, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a ride thither to her young friends, who every hour more charmed with the ſociety of their aunt, expreſſed the pleaſure they felt in the thought of attending her.

               <p>Mrs. Goodman replied, ſhe ſhould be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to ſhew the young lady and gentleman the little that was worth their notice; but added, that ſhe hoped Mrs. Mills would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them firſt to take ſuch refreſhments as the houſe afforded.

Afterwards the good woman, at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of Mrs. Mills, conducted them into an adjacent meadow, to view a brood of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ducklings.

               <p>From hence Mrs. Goodman took them to her granary—her dairy, which was neatneſs itſelf—her hay ricks—nor did ſhe forget her pig-ſties, which were perfectly clean, and

At the well known ſound, they came trooping from all parts; but ſcarcely were arrived, when a candidate of a different kind put them to flight. This was no other than a tortoiſe-ſhell cat, which made way for a fine white hen that followed her. The hen without ceremony, fell upon the grain, and puſs, like a faithful guard, ſtood by to keep off intruders, till ſhe had eaten her fill: after which, ſhe walked off in triumph with her charge, leaving the coaſt clear to the reſt of the poultry, which immediately ſucceeded. This ſcene was not more new to the young people than to Mrs. Mills: that an animal ſhould diſcover ſuch affectionate ſolicitude for a creature it was its nature to deſtroy, ſurpriſed her, and her ſurpriſe was not leſſened by the account the farmer's wife gave of this</p>

I took a world of trouble, but it grew worſe and worſe, till at laſt its poor eyes cloſed, and I really thought it dying. I was ſo vexed to think of the time I had ſpent upon it to no purpoſe, that I threw it in a pet to the cat, who lay aſleep by the fire, in my huſband's arm-chair. I thought, to be ſure, ſhe would have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

Yes, madam, ſhe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red over it, and the little creature ſeemed to revive by her warmth. I was ſo ſurpriſed that I could ſcarcely believe my eyes; and my huſband was not leſs ſo, when he came home from work, to ſee the cat nurſing the chicken, with as much tenderneſs as if it had been her kitten. You may be ſure, Madam, we did not take it from her except to feed it, which was a part of the buſineſs puſs could not perform. In ſhort, ſhe ſeemed to receive it in the place of a litter of kittens we had juſt before drowned, and grew fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and fonder of it every day.

               <p>"Well," ſaid William, "I am amazed, I could not have believed a cat capable of ſuch tenderneſs; I always thought them malicious and revengeful, and at ſchool have played them many a wicked prank."</p>
               <p>"I have been told," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "that cats furniſh much cruel diverſion to ſchool-boys; but ſurely not to my William! he cannot tyrannize over a poor animal, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe it has no power to defend itſelf, and delight in tortures at which every heart, not callous to the feelings of humanity, muſt recoil."</p>
               <p>"I cannot deny," replied William, "that I have joined our boys in many wicked prank they played, eſpecially in hunting of cats; but indeed, aunt, I never reflected on what the poor animal muſt have ſuffered. I thought only of my own amuſement; but, I aſſure you, I will never again join in ſuch cruel ſports."</p>
               <p>"Remember, my dear boy," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "that God commands you to be merciful to all creatures, and that he hears the cry of the weakeſt animal: then reflect
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:030966_0154_0FEA0DB8364032E8"/>
on the happineſs which reſults from commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating pleaſure, and I am ſure you will not ſeek it in inflicting pain."</p>
               <p>"But, aunt, I always thought cats very malicious and revengeful."</p>
               <p>"Cats, William, like other animals, are ſenſible of good or bad treatment: if you uſe them well, they will carreſs you; if ill they will endeavour to retaliate."</p>
               <p>"But they are certainly leſs faithful than dogs," replied William.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps ſo," ſaid Mrs. Mils; "but there are many inſtances which prove them not deficient in point of attachment. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, a few years paſt, reading in a magazine of a cat, which diſcovered ſo ſtrong an attachment to a dog, that, ſeeing him one day engaged with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, before her maſter's houſe, ſhe flew into the ſtreet, and fell upon the antagoniſt of her favorite with ſuch fury, that ſhe forced him, in the ſight of numerous ſpectators, to quit the field."</p>
               <p>"But is there not," ſaid Clara, "in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, an antipathy between cats and dogs?"</p>
               <p>"It appears ſo," replied Mrs. Mills: "but when they are bred together, it ſeems to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and I have known many inſtances in which it has given place to cordial affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which makes me the more readily give credit to the anecdote I have juſt related: but, without forcing nature from her general
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:030966_0155_0FEA0DBC25EC2140"/>
courſe, repeated inſtances prove that cats are capable of very ſtrong attachments."</p>
               <p>"Well, aunt," ſaid William, "though you are ſuch an advocate for cats, you muſt allow, after all, they are of little uſe."</p>
               <p>"I could tell you," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "of cats that were taught to hunt and deſtroy ſerpents; for ſo it is recorded they did in the iſland of Cyprus; but the ſervices they render us in England are, in my opinion, ſufficient to exalt their fame, and entitle them to kind treatment."</p>
               <p>"I do not," ſaid William, "recollect any ſervice they can do us, except the killing of a few rats and mice."</p>
               <p>"Do you not think that," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "an eſſential ſervice?"</p>
               <p>"Truly, aunt," returned William, "if cats can render us no greater ſervice, I do not think we have ſo much reaſon to value them. What harm can ſuch inſignificant creatures as rats and mice do us? To be ſure, they make free with a little of our bacon and cheeſe—but that is not worth the think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of."</p>
               <p>"Very true, William," ſaid Clara.</p>
               <p>"Theſe inſignificant creatures," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "as William calls them, may be more formidable than either of you imagine: I once knew a gentleman whoſe houſe, in Scotland, was undermined, and the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhakened by rats."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="153" facs="unknown:030966_0156_0FEA0DBE609D22E8"/>
"Indeed!"</p>
               <p>"Yes; they came from a ſhip that touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the port, and infeſted his houſe in ſuch numbers, that the foundation of it actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally gave way: and the damage he ſuſtained from them, in this and other inſtances, was eſtimated at upwards of five hundred pounds."</p>
               <p>"Was it poſſible!" ſaid Clara.</p>
               <p>"There was ſcarcely a cheſt or a drawer in his houſe into which they did not pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate: The linen was gnawed in holes—and as to the proviſions! ſugar—meat—bread—rice—corn—nothing eſcaped the rava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of thoſe mercileſs ſpoilers."</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid William, "could one have thought it poſſible for ſo ſmall an animal as a rat to do ſuch miſchief!"</p>
               <p>"So it was," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "and you cannot but confeſs the utility of the cat, which preſerves us from creatures which are capable of being ſo formidable."</p>
               <p>"I ſee," ſaid William, "that Mrs. Puſs is of more conſequence than I thought her."</p>
               <p>"But, as I have acquainted you," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "with the plunders of theſe miſchievous animals, I muſt not forget the ingenuity with which ſome of them were executed: What do you think of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying eggs, unbroken, from the top of the houſe, which was three ſtories high, to the bottom?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="154" facs="unknown:030966_0157_0FEA0DC0149E1B50"/>
"Why, I think," ſaid William, it was, abſolutely impoſſible."</p>
               <p>"I ſhould myſelf," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "have thought ſo, had I not been told it was a fact by my friend and his lady, upon whoſe ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity I can place the firmeſt reliance."</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid William, "I think it could be effected by nothing leſs than a miracle: do tell us, aunt, how it was."</p>
               <p>"I am myſelf," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant how the buſineſs was performed; I can only tell you that, at the ſeaſon of the year when eggs are plenty, my friend, as it is cuſtomary in the north, greaſed a number and put them into a large ſtone jar, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them ſweet for uſe. A ſhort time after, ſhe was much ſurpriſed to find the eggs, which were in the jars at the top of the houſe, conſiderably diminiſhed, though none had been uſed in the family. It was thought impoſſible this could be the work of the rats; but ſo it proved: On a ſtrict examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the eggs, in part whole and part ſhells, with the contents ſucked out, were found in burrows made by the rats, at the bottom of the houſe."</p>
               <p>"How could they poſſibly carry them, without breaking?" ſaid Clara.</p>
               <p>"That is a myſtery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my dear," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "I cannot explain; I can only aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you, upon authority I cannot doubt, that the fact really happened."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="155" facs="unknown:030966_0158_0FEA0DC2695BF3A0"/>
"They muſt have rolled them down the ſtairs," ſaid William.</p>
               <p>"Nay," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "in that caſe, they muſt inevitably have broken."</p>
               <p>"Oh," ſaid William, "I have juſt thought how they managed the buſineſs; I remember hearing my papa tell of a friend of his, who once watched and ſaw one of theſe ingenious gentlemen hop down ſtairs, upon his hind legs, with ſome corn which he had taken from the garret, in his fore paws; I dare ſay, the rats you have been telling us about conveyed the eggs down in the ſame manner."</p>
               <p>"It is very likely they might, ſaid Mrs. Mills; "but I think it equally probable that the buſineſs was effected by combination; that is to ſay, that more than one was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it, though I cannot ſay whether performed exactly in the ſame manner AEſop repreſents in his fable of the two rats and the egg. Since I have known the anecdote of my friend's eggs, it has more than once occurred to me that it is poſſible the fable in AEſop might be founded upon a fact; I am perſuaded, that all animals have a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage or ſign, by which they underſtand each other, as far as it is neceſſary for their mutual benefit and preſervation; and that rats have a language, and act in concert is evident from a curious anecdote that I will relate to you:"</p>
               <p>"A gentleman having a preſent of ſome
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:030966_0159_0FEA0DC4D1935420"/>
Florence oil, the flaſks were ſet in his cellar, in the bottom of a ſhallow box: the oil not being wanted for uſe, they remained there ſome time; when the owner, going one day by chance into the cellar, was ſurpriſed to find the wicker work, by which the flaſks were ſtopped, gnawed from the greater part, and, upon examination, the oil ſunk about two, or two inches and a half from the neck of each-flaſk. It ſoon occurred to him that it muſt be the work of ſome kind of vermin; and being a man of a ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive turn, he reſolved to ſatisfy the curioſity raiſed in his mind; he accordingly found means to watch, and actually detected three rats in the very act: but how do you think they managed to get at the oil? You know the neck of the flaſk was long and narrow; it required therefore ſome contrivance.</p>
               <p>"Indeed it did," ſaid William; "but I dare ſay the rats found out a better expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for themſelves than I ſhould for them."</p>
               <p>"I told you three rats were engaged in the buſineſs," reſumed Mrs. Mills: "one of theſe ſtood upon the edge of the box, while another, mounting his back, dipped his tail in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>

was his turn to act the porter, and he took his ſtation at the bottom. In this manner the three rats alternately relieved each oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and banquetted upon the oil, till they had ſunk it beyond the length of their tails."</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid Clara, "if they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to ſuch a contrivance, they could beat no loſs to convey the eggs to their burrows without breaking: one may believe them capable of any thing: but is the ſtory really to be relied on?"</p>
               <p>"I had it from the mouth of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who was himſelf witneſs of the fact he was a man of character and ſpeculation, upon whoſe veracity I can rely."</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid William, "it is a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ſtory, but nothing can ſurpriſe me after puſs and her chicken, that exceeds every thing I ever heard of."</p>
               <p>"It was a ſingular circumſtance," ſaid the Lady, "but I think Mrs. Goodman told us puſs had juſt loſt a litter of kittens?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, madam," ſaid the farmer's wife, who had been liſtening with ſilent attention to the diſcourſe, "ſhe had kittened a few days before, and my huſband had drowned the litter."</p>
               <p>"This circumſtance, then," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "accounts in ſome meaſure, for an attachment that appears otherwiſe, ſo fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to the nature of the animal; we can
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:030966_0161_0FEA0DCA34227368"/>
find no difficulty in ſuppoſing, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, which nature had awakened in the cat, for the preſervation of her own young, deprived of its object, was eaſily transferred to the chicken, upon which it acted with equal force."</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid William, "whatever might be the cauſe, it was a droll ſight, to ſee puſs march up the yard, with her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered attendant; I declare it was worth riding five miles to ſee her."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mills, now thinking it time to take leave of their obliging hoſteſs, wiſhed her a good day, and ſtepped into the carriage, followed by her young friends, who return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed extremely pleaſed with the farm, and its inhabitants, in whoſe countenance Clara thought ſhe obſerved more happineſs and content than ſhe had ever experienced in the poſſeſſion of thoſe gaities ſhe had, three days ago, conſidered as the chief bleſſings of life.</p>

               <p>"This prudent conduct of the young Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror could not but engage the affections of Byram, by whoſe exertion he was ſoon ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled peaceably upon the throne, and his kingdom in a flouriſhing ſtate: but, though Byram was an able ſtateſman, and an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced warrior, his diſpoſition was ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and vindictive; he grew jealous of the favours beſtowed by his maſter upon others, and began to ſuſpect his affection eſtranged from him. On the other hand, the king in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed at ſome acts of ſeverity and injuſtice which he had committed, by power of his authority, though he ſtill perſonally reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Byram, thought it time to take the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the kingdom upon himſelf, which he accordingly did, and the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was diſmiſſed from the regency.</p>

When Byram appeared before the Emperor, he hung his turban round his neck, in token of humiliation, and threw himſelf in tears at the foot of the throne.

               <p>Byram replied, "The royal confidence and friendſhip for me muſt now be dimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed; nay, loſt: why then ſhould I remain in the preſence? the clemency of the king is enough for me, and his forgiveneſs of my late errors, a ſufficient reward for my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſervices.

               <p>"The Emperor aſſented to his requeſt, and ordered for him a proper retinue, with 50,000 rupees a-year, to ſupport his dignity. Byram, however, did not enjoy the bounty of his maſter, being baſely aſſaſſinated, in his way to Mecca, by one, whoſe father he had killed in battle."</p>

               <p>'Undoubtedly,' ſaid Mrs. Mills, "it did; we may he aſſured that the kindneſs of his maſter wounded him, more than the ſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reproaches. The painter has in the piece before us deſcribed, in lively colours, the ſhame, grief, and admiration, that By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram muſt have felt when introduced into the preſence of his maſter, and treated with ſo much generoſity: on the other hand, what generous pity and benignity beams in the countenance of the young Prince, as he raiſes the proſtrate miniſter, to place him in his former dignity!—but as we are ſpeaking of the heroes of Indoſtan, obſerve the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is oppoſite: the principal figure is Durgetti, queen of Gurat, celebrated for her beauty and accompliſhments."</p>
               <p>"She is clothed in armour," obſerved Clara, "and mounted on an elephant."</p>
               <p>"Yes," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "it was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the cuſtom of many eaſtern nations to uſe elephants in war; but ſince muſkets and

cannon have been introduced, the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, being frightened at the noiſe of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, prove more dangerous than uſeful in battle.</p>
               <p>"The extent of Durgetti's dominions were very ſmall, not exceeding three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred miles in length, and one in breadth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but ſo flouriſhing was this ſmall tract, that it comprehended more than ſeventy thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand towns and villages, well inhabited. Aſaph, the governor of a neighbouring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, allured by the riches of this kingdom, marched againſt it; the queen, with a force equally powerful, prepared to oppoſe him. She led her troops to action, as you ſee the artiſt has repreſented in the picture, clad in armour, and mounted on a caſtle upon an elephant, with a bow and quiver lying at her ſide, and a lance in her hand. Her troops were in general unacquainted with war, but the noble example of their queen, and the love of their native independence, inſpired every breaſt with courage, and they repulſed the enemy with ſuch fury, that they left ſix hundred horſemen dead on the field, and purſued the reſt, with great ſlaughter. Night coming on, the queen halted with her army, and gave orders to her troops that they might be ready to make an attack upon the enemy before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from their conſternation: but her
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:030966_0168_0FEA0DDCB87C9DF8"/>
miniſters and chiefs oppoſed this meaſure, and inſiſted upon returning to the field of battle, to bury their friends. The queen reluctantly conſented; and after the bodies of the ſlain, according to the cuſtom of the country, were burnt, again ſolicited her chiefs to accompany her to ſtorm the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gul camps. They, however, wanting her courage and prudence, vainly imagined the enemy would of their own accord evacuate the country, and refuſed to ſecond the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enterpriſe of their queen. Fatally were they deceived. Aſaph attacked them the next morning with his heavy artillery, which he had the day before left behind on account of the badneſs of the roads. The queen advanced, upon the approach of Aſaph, to a narrow paſs, to oppoſe him; but he quickly opened himſelf a way into the plain beyond, where the army was drawn up in order for battle. Prince Biar, the queen's ſon, a youth of great hopes, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited prodigies of valour; till being wounded, he became faint with the loſs of blood, when his mother, who was mounted on an elephant, in the front of the battle, ſeeing him ready to fall from his horſe, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſome of her people to bear him from the field. The loſs of the prince, and of many who quitted the field with him, ſtruck ſuch a panic into the reſt, that the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate

She, however, no ways affected with her deſperate ſituation, ſtood her ground, with her former fortitude, till ſhe received an arrow in the eye; in endeavouring to extricate it, part of the ſteel broke ſhort, and remained behind. In the mean time, another arrow paſſed through her neck, which ſhe alſo drew out; but nature ſinking under the pain, ſhe faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: recovering, however, by degrees, a brave officer of her houſhold, who drove her elephant, ſingly repulſed numbers of the enemy, wherever he turned the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous animal. He begged permiſſion, as the day was now irretrievable, to carry the queen from the field, a propoſal which ſhe rejected with diſdain."</p>
               <p>"It is true," ſaid ſhe, "we are overcome in war, but ſhall we ever be vanquiſhed in honour? ſhall we, for the ſake of lingering out an ignominious life, loſe the reputation and virtue we have been ſo ſolicitous to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire? no; let your gratitude repay the ſervice for which I raiſed you, and which I now require at your hands: haſte, let your dagger ſave me from the crime of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a period to my own exiſtence."</p>
               <p>"Adhar, which was the name of the officer, burſt into tears, and begged, as the elephant was ſwift of foot, that he

might be permitted to carry her from the field, to place of ſafety. In the mean time, the queen finding the enemy crouded faſt around her, ſuddenly leaned forward, and ſeizing Adhar's daggar, plunged it into her boſom, and expired.</p>
               <p>"The death of the queen rendered Aſaph's victory complete. A few days after he beſeiged the fortreſs of Jora, where all the treaſures of this noble family had been preſerved for ten generations. The young prince, a little recovered from his wounds, bravely exerted himſelf, and loſt his life in defence of his kingdom, and independence."</p>
               <p>"What a pity it is aunt," ſaid William, "that there is ſuch a thing as war! how many it makes miſerable."</p>
               <p>"In the preſent ſtate of the world," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Mrs. Mills, "war is ſometimes neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but then it muſt be undertaken in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of our lives, property, or indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. We turn with diſguſt and horror from the individual, who, hurried on by an inſatiable thirſt of wealth or power calmly ſacrifices thouſands of his ſpecies in purſuit of idols, which, when attained, can afford an imperfect, and at beſt, but a tranſient, ſatisfaction. We feel very differently inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted for Aſaph, whoſe ſole object was the riches of the kingdom of Gurat, and for the queen who ſo nobly exerted herſelf to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

the independance and property of the ſubjects."</p>
               <p>"Certainly we do, aunt," ſaid Clara; "but pray, do you think the queen of Gurat did right to kill herſelf?"</p>
               <p>"Can you aſk ſuch a queſtion?" replied Mrs. Mills; "it is an action which ſullies all her former glories: The ignorance of the age and country in which ſhe lived, where it was held more noble to die than to ſuffer the ignominy of captivity, might palliate the crime, did it not appear from the words ſhe addreſſed to her faithful offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, 'Haſte, let your dagger ſave me from the <hi>crime</hi> of putting an end to my exiſtence,' that ſhe did not err entirely through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. Let us, therefore, in paying a juſt tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of praiſe to her courage and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, draw a veil over her errors." Saying this Mrs. Mills called the attention of her young friends to other pictures, and having entertained them with ſeveral pleaſing anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes that occurred to her, upon review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each: "That," ſaid ſhe, "is Alfred, one of our Britiſh kings, diſguiſed as a har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the Daniſh camp."</p>
               <p>Clara enquired the cauſe of his diſguiſe?</p>
               <p>"The Danes," replied Mrs. Mills, "had uſurped his kingdom; he, therefore, uſed this ſtratagem to inform himſelf of their ſituations and deſigns".</p>

"Pray, aunt," ſaid William, "was it not Alfred who firſt divided England into coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?"</p>
               <p>"It was," replied Mrs. Mills; "long wars had introduced ſuch diſorders into the kingdom, that vagrants every where abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, who, having no ſettled place of abode, after committing all ſorts of outrages, by ſhifting their quarters, eaſily eluded juſtice. To prevent this, Alfred divided the whole Iſland into counties, the counties into hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds and the hundreds into tythings. This done, every inhabitant was obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to ſome tything, otherwiſe he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a vagabond, and the owner of the houſe where he lodged, in caſe of his eſcape, became reſponſible for any miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour he might commit."</p>
               <p>"It was a very wiſe regulation," ſaid William; "Alfred was a great king!"</p>
               <p>"He was not only a great king," replied Mrs. Mills, "but a good man: his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the moſt perfect handed down to us by hiſtorians; eſpecially, if we conſider the obſcure age in which he lived: he protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his country by arms, poliſhed it by arts, and enacted many uſeful laws for the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and future welfare of his people.

               <p>"It is aſtoniſhing then that you ſhould not call to mind a circumſtance ſo generally known, and in itſelf ſo remarkable: The reign of Richard the Second was diſturbed by many civil commotions, and among others by an inſurrection of the common people, on account of the pole-tax, headed by a blackſmith, known by the name of Wat Tyler. This rebellion became ſo formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that it was thought adviſeable to offer terms, which being repeatedly rejected by the mutineers, the king propoſed a confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with their leader, which took place accordingly in Smithfield<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but, in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview,

the inſolence of Tyler, who brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed his dagger with an air of authority, ſo incenſed Sir Thomas Walworth, mayor of London, that ſuſpecting his deſign was to ſtab the king, he ſtunned him with a blow of his mace, and another of the king's reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue run him thro' the body. The rebels, ſeeing their leader fall, immediately prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to revenge him, and bent their bows for this purpoſe; when the king, though at this time not ſixteen years of age, rode up to them, and in a reſolute tone of voice: 'What, my friends,' ſaid he, 'will you then kill your king? be not concerned for the loſs of that traitor; I myſelf will be your leader; Follow me, and I will grant you all your reaſonable deſires.'</p>
               <p>"The magnanimity of the young king ſtruck the multitude with ſuch awe, that they changed their firſt purpoſe, and, as if mechanically led, followed him into the fields, where they laid down their arms."</p>
               <p>"What an aſtoniſhing inſtance of courage and preſence of mind!" ſaid Clara, "How ſurpriſing, that it ſhould not ſtrike me, when I read the hiſtory of England! but I ſuppoſe I was thinking of ſomething elſe."</p>
               <p>"To be thinking of one thing and doing another," obſerved her aunt, "is the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain way to preclude improvement; and of all ignorance, none is ſo diſgraceful as

               <q rend="inline normQuotes">
                  <p>You muſt know, ſiſter, that Regulus was a great warrior: The Romans ſent him to fight againſt the Carthagenians; he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came them in ſeveral battles, but was at laſt defeated and taken priſoner. After a long time, the Carthagenians wiſhed to make peace with the Romans; ſo they ſent Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus with their ambaſſadors to Rome, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as he had been a priſoner four years, he would perſuade his countrymen to put an end to the war, that he might be ſet free: but, before the Carthagenians let Regulus depart, they made him ſolemnly promiſe, in caſe the Romans did not agree to a peace, that he would return, and deliver himſelf up their priſoner.</p>
               </q>
               <p>"All the Romans were rejoiced when they heard that Regulus was returning to Rome: but he, with a ſettled melancholy, upon his arrival, refuſed to enter the gates, ſaying, that he was a ſlave to the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genians, and unworthy the honours his country would beſtow on him. So he ſtayed without the gates; and when the Senate aſſembled there (as was uſual, to give audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the ambaſſadors) he made propoſals for a peace, as the Carthagenians had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected him. The Senate were very much inclined to accept them, and it remained
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:030966_0177_0FEA0DF2EA756280"/>
only for Regulus, who had great influence with his countrymen, to give his opinion; which, to the ſurpriſe of every one, he did for a continuance of the war. The Senate, though convinced by his arguments, could not reſolve upon a meaſure that muſt end in the ruin of a man who had acted ſo nobly; but Regulus, fearing they might be biaſſed by any perſonal concern for him, relieved their embarraſſment, by breaking off the treaty, and riſing to return with the ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors to Carthage, which, in ſpite of the entreaties of the Senate and his deareſt friends, he did, though he well knew the tortures he ſhould undergo: but nothing would prevail upon him to break the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe he had given to the Carthagenians, who, I am ſorry to tell you, were ſo enrag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when they heard from their ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors that Regulus, inſtead of haſtening a peace, had given his voice for the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the war, that for three days they tortured him in the moſt cruel man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and at laſt left him to expire in a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel ſtuck with ſpikes."</p>
               <p>"What wretches they muſt have been," ſaid Clara, "to puniſh him for acting ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly!"</p>
               <p>"Their conduct," replied Mrs. Mills, "was indeed truly deſpicable; but of what enormities will not rancour and revenge render human nature capable!"</p>

Porſenna, poſſeſſed a mind too noble not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge merit, though found in an enemy; ſtruck with the courage and magnanimity of the young man, he ordered him to be ſafely conducted back to Rome, and offered the beſieged terms of peace, which, being neither hard nor diſgraceful, were readily accepted."</p>
               <p>Clara thanked her brother for obliging her with the extract: and obſerved, in her turn, that the conduct of Proſenna formed a ſtriking contraſt to that of the Carthage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians: "How noble," ſaid ſhe, "to forgive the young man who had attempted to kill him!"</p>

               <p>The young people were extremely pleaſed, and having completed their walk, retired
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:030966_0181_0FEA0DFD49833DE0"/>
to reſt, fully occupied with the thought of the pleaſure they were to enjoy the next day. But a diſappointment awaited them; a continued rain put a ſtop to the jaunt. Clara, who, though much improved by the converſation of her aunt, had not yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired philoſophy to bear a diſappointment without murmuring, began to be a little out of humour: ſhe concealed it as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible from her aunt, whoſe good opinion ſhe was very ambitious to attain, but could not forbear thinking they ſhould paſs a very dull day, and, during breakfaſt, was ſo intent upon watching the clouds, that ſhe could ſcarcely attend to any thing that paſſed, till Mrs. Mills, having obſerved how neceſſary it was to accuſtom ourſelves to bear diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, added, that though the weather for the preſent had put a ſtop to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended expedition, ſhe doubted not, as her young pupils ſeem pleaſed with the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of nature, that ſhe could ſupply them with amuſement equally agreeable. Clara and William, who wiſhed much to have ſeen the aviary, were unwilling to believe this, till Mrs. Mills, taking them into her dreſſing room, opened</p>

in exact order, according to their ſeveral claſſes. This was indeed an agreeable ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe! The young people no longer regretted the aviary, but thought their aunt had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied them with amuſement, if not for the whole day, at leaſt for a conſiderable part of it. Mrs. Mills, as uſual, heightened their entertainment by a variety of curious parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, which ſhe gave them of the little tribe that had once occupied the ſhells. They were particularly attentive to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the purple-fiſh, which ſhe told them had upon its back a little folded tunicle or bag, containing a white liquor, which dyed wool of a deep and unfading purple, and was ſuppoſed to be the ſame uſed by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients for their purple dye; but ſhe added, that the quantity of this liquor in each fiſh was ſo very ſmall, that an immenſe number were neceſſary to dye one piece of ſtuff, which cauſed the ancients to ſet a very high value on their Tyrian dye, ſo called, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, from its being firſt diſcovered or uſed by the people of Tyre.</p>

This cabinet having for ſome time fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed entertainment, Mrs. Mills unlocked ed the folding door of another, which ſtood in a niche oppoſite, and contained a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcellaneous collection of natural curioſities. Clara's eye ſoon fixed on an American hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming bird, which, though dried, preſerved a great ſhare of its natural beauty. She took it from the cabinet with wonder, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the luſtre of its plumage, and above all its ſize, which did not greatly exceed that of a humble bee.</p>
               <p>"Dear," ſaid ſhe, "what a beautiful lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle creature! though ſo ſmall, the feathers, wings, talons, every part of it is as perfect as thoſe of the largeſt birds: how I ſhould like to ſee one alive?"</p>
               <p>"In America," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming birds of various ſorts are conſtantly ſeen fluttering about the flowers, from whence they extract the honey that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports them. The motion of their wings is ſo rapid, that it produces a humming ſound, from which their name is derived."</p>
               <p>"I thought," ſaid William, "it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible they could feed upon ſeed and ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as other birds do, the beak is ſo ſmall; it is not larger than a fine needle!"</p>
               <p>"Small as it is," rejoined Mrs. Mills, "it renders them very formidable to larger birds, and eſpecially to one called the
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:030966_0184_0FEA0E064600B288"/>
gooſbee, which attempts to ſurpriſe the young humming birds in the neſt, but flies off on the appearance of the mother, who purſues the invader cloſe, and faſtening her little talons under his wing, pierces him with her pointed beak, till ſhe has entirely diſabled him. Here is the neſt of the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming bird; have you examined it."</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid William, "this is indeed a neſt in miniature! and, as I live! two little eggs, not bigger than a ſmall pea!"</p>
               <p>"How ſmall," ſaid Clara, "the pretty creatures muſt be when they are firſt hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!"</p>
               <p>"They are ſaid to be about the ſize of a large blue fly," replied Mrs. Mills.</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid William, "it would be worth taking a voyage to America to ſee a humming bird.</p>
               <p>"And pray," rejoined his aunt, "what do you think of a trip to the coaſt of Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea, where deer are ſaid to be found no big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than kittens!"</p>
               <p>"Is that true?"</p>
               <p>"Here is the leg of one," reſumed his aunt; "it is a common article in the cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of the curious: nay, I have ſeen them made into tobacco ſtoppers."</p>
               <p>"Dear," ſaid Clara, "how ſmall! How I ſhould like to have a Guinea deer and an American humming bird!"</p>
               <p>

"And ſo ſhould I," ſaid William; "but pray, madam," continued he, "what is this? to judge from its appearance, it ſhould ſeem unworthy a place among ſo many ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities.—It is ſo dried and ſhrivelled, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to ſay what is the form or colour."</p>
               <p>"It is," replied Mrs. Mills, "a leaf of the Papyrus, a large plant which grows wild in Egypt amidſt the ſtagnate waters, after the inundations of the Nile. The Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Romans formerly uſed a part of this plant for the purpoſes we do paper. The intermediate part of the ſtalk was cut and ſeparated into different plates or laminae, which were laid together upon a ſmooth board, ſo as to form ſheets. They were then moiſtened with water, which diſſolved a kind of glew that was in the pores, which ſerved as a cement. The ſheets thus form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed were dried, preſſed, and kept for uſe. The Romans afterwards invented methods to bring it to further perfection. They beat it with hammers, to render it thin and leſs porous, poliſhed it with ivory, and, by a ſort of calendar, gave it a ſhining gloſs.—It is from this plant that the paper of our day takes its name. The Egyptians, alſo, uſed the roots for firing, and many other purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; built little boats of the plant itſelf, and formed the inner bark into ſails, mats, gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, coverlids, and cordage; they alſo
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:030966_0186_0FEA0E0BCFC9D6F0"/>
chewed it, and ſwallowed the juice as a great dainty. You ſee, therefore, William, that the intrinſic worth of this plant gives it a juſt title to obſervation."</p>
               <p>"It certainly does, aunt," ſaid William, "I ſee it is not right to truſt always to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances; but what is this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> bleſs me, 'tis a ſtone tree!"</p>
               <p>"It has that appearance," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "it is a petrifaction. Certain ſprings abound with ſparry particles, which being, by time, inſinuated into the pores of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance put into them, ſuppoſe, for example, a vegetable, as in the inſtance before us, form a cruſt round it, which gives it, as you ſee, the appearance of ſtone."</p>
               <p>"I have heard," ſaid, William, "of thoſe petrifying waters, but always under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood they actually changed the things that were put into them to ſtone."</p>
               <p>"No," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "that is a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, the vegetable undergoes no alteration; the ſtony particles of the ſpring, only, by adhering to it, in the manner I have told you, acquires the exact form, while the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable it has encloſed decays."</p>
               <p>"Theſe petrifying waters," ſaid Clara, "are, I ſuppoſe, very dangerous to drink."</p>
               <p>"I am not," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently acquainted with their phyſical proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to tell you, whether or not they be
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:030966_0187_0FEA0E0F34160BA0"/>
wholeſome. But as no petrifaction can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in a vegetable, where there is a circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the juices, it follows, I apprehend, that no immediate bad effect, can occur from the drinking ſuch waters, the blood being in conſtant circulation throughout our body."</p>
               <p>"Here is another petrifaction," ſaid Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, "taking up a little ſtony branch, but it is different from the other."</p>
               <p>"That," ſaid Mrs. Mills, is coral, which is now aſcertained to be a regular vegetati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, though once thought by many learned men to be nothing more than a petrified ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. It grows with the top downwards, in little caverns, or the jutting out of rocks, at the bottom of the ſea. On the branches are ſmall tumours, containing a ſort of milk, and pinked in the form of ſtars, from whence little flowers have been obſerved to ſhoot, but they withdraw upon being expoſed any time to the air. This is the mandrepore, another ſtony ſea plant.</p>
               <p>"It is in the form, you ſee, of a little tree, the branches of which are ſtudded with ſeveral holes; but there are different ſorts of the mandrepore."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mills here ceaſed—and looking at her watch, roſe and ſhut the cabinet.</p>
               <p>The young people thanked her for their entertainment, and were retiring, when
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:030966_0188_0FEA0E116A940258"/>
Clara ſtopped to examine a fine piece of embroidery that hung over the chimney.</p>
               <p>"That piece," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "is the work of my God-daughter, Miſs Elinor Reeves: I am indebted to her kindneſs and ingenuity for moſt of the pieces that furniſh this room; if I am not miſtaken, you are no ſtrangers to each other."</p>
               <p>Clara replied, "that ſhe had ſeveral times been in company with Miſs Reeves."</p>
               <p>"Then," rejoined Mrs. Mills, "I am ſure you will look with pleaſure upon theſe little eſſays of her ſkill; for I will venture to affirm, no one can know my dear Elinor without loving her. Her diſpoſition is truly amiable."</p>
               <p>Clara made no reply; accuſtomed from her infancy to flattery, the praiſes of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther were never welcome to her ear: wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therefore, to change the converſation, ſhe turned to a landſcape that hung on the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſide of the room; and having enquired from what part of Europe the view was tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, obſerved, that it was a very fine engrav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."</p>
               <p>"An engraving!" ſaid Mrs. Mills, "upon my word, you pay Elinor a great compliment; 'tis executed with the needle."</p>
               <p>Clara was diſappointed—ſhe was vexed ſhe had taken notice of the piece, and was again ſilent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="unknown:030966_0189_0FEA0E145DA700E0"/>
"I am not a judge of needle work," ſaid William, "but I think that fruit (pointing to a piece of embroidery that hung near) is very natural. Do not you ſiſter?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," ſaid Clara, "it is not amiſs; but, in theſe things, the praiſe is rather due to the perſon who deſigned, than the perſon who worked the piece. The effect does not altogether depend upon the needle."</p>
               <p>"Very true," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle cannot make a bad deſign, a perfect pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but it can add great beauty to a good one; and with reſpect to theſe before us, their chief beauty is derived from the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle: obſerve thoſe cherries and that peach; how admirably the colours are ſoftened one into another—with what judgment the ſhadows are thrown—one could almoſt fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy it poſſible to take them from the baſket. This is reckoned one of Elinor's moſt capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal performance, and you muſt allow it excellent."</p>
               <p>"O!" returned Clara, "I do not ſay, it has not merit, but your partiality, aunt, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me) makes you blind to the imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.—Now I think, had more colour been thrown into the peach, the effect had been better—and are not the ſtalks of the cheries a trifle too long?"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Mills beheld with concern the envy that gave riſe to theſe obſervations. "Well,
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:030966_0190_0FEA0E17CF428E20"/>
my dear," ſaid ſhe, "if you will not allow your friend merit, as an artiſt, you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that her diſpoſition is truly amiable."</p>
               <p>"Why," ſaid Clara, "ſhe may be very amiable, but I own, I do not think her quite ſo faultleſs as you ſeem to deſcribe."—"But, Madam," (continued ſhe, wiſhing to put an end to a converſation from which ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced ſo little pleaſure,) "is it not time to dreſs for dinner?"</p>
               <p>"I will detain you no longer, my dear," ſaid Mrs. Mills, eſpecially as I have a little ſearch to make for a manuſcript, which it has juſt now occurred to me, will furniſh entertainment for the afternoon."</p>
               <p>"How good you are, Madam," ſaid Clara, "you are always thinking of us. Then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that William had left the room, ſhe ſet off in purſuit of him to communicate the agreeable news."</p>

               <p>"Charlotte Graves, and Maria Wilmot, were nearly of the ſame age: Their parents were intimate friends, and near neighbours,
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:030966_0191_0FEA0E1A4B824618"/>
which cauſed the children to be much toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſtrengthened the affection, which, in the tender years of infancy exiſted between them; but this friendly intercourſe was early i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>terrupted; the declining ſtate of Mrs. Wilmot's health rendering it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhe ſhould breathe her native air. Mr. Wilmot purchaſed an eſtate in Wales, to which he ſhortly retired with his family. Maria was at this time eight years of age, and her friend Charlotte juſt twelve months younger. The little girls ſhed many tears at parting, promiſed to love each other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, and as they had both been for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time in joining-hand, to write to each other often.</p>
               <p>"The year after the retirement of Mr. Wilmot, Charlotte had the misfortune to loſe her mother, who died ſuddenly, and a perſon from France was engaged to ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend her education. Had this lady been worthy the truſt repoſed in her, all had been well; but, unfortunately, no one more improper could poſſibly have been choſen. Her manners were indeed poliſhed; her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs was inſinuating, but ſhe was wholly without principle or ſentiment; beauty, ſplender and riches, were in her eſtimation, the chief bleſſings of life, and if ſhe had a view beyond her own intereſt, which ſhe endeavoured to promote, by flattering her
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:030966_0192_0FEA0E1BF7596B18"/>
follies, it was to poliſh the manners of her pupil, rather then to cultivate her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding or to form her heart.</p>
               <p>"At the early age of nine, with a mind little turned to reflection, it is not ſurpriſing that Charlotte ſhould imbibe the follies and prejudices of her governante; ſhe readily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, that providence, in giving her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, had beſtowed on her its choiceſt bleſſing; and while ſhe ſpared no attention to embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh her perſon, ſuffered her underſtanding to lie wholly neglected. Vain, frivolous, fond of admiration, her follies, by indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, ſwelled into vices; among which, envy and detraction were not the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous; her heart ſickened at perfection in another, and her tongue was ever ready to depreciate the excellence ſhe could not attain.</p>
               <p>"Maria, in the mean while, was rapidly improving in every amiable virtue and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant accompliſhment. She, too, had loſt her mother, but the kind attention of her father, who dedicated the chief of his time to her improvement, and the tenderneſs of a maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en aunt, who reſided with them, ſoftened the ſeverity of her misfortune: ſhe already perfectly underſtood three languages, was miſtreſs of geography, played incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply on the pedal harp, and diſcovered a great taſte for painting; but theſe accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments,
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:030966_0193_0FEA0E1DCE9C14F0"/>
though joined to a handſome perſon, conſtituted but a ſmall part of her perfections. Her piety, her reſpectful affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to her father and aunt, her ſweetneſs of temper, her gentleneſs, her humility, added a ſuperior luſtre to her character; every one loved, every one admired, every one eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her. Her accompliſhments and virtues, at length reached the ear of her friend Charlotte, who, at firſt paid little attention to what ſhe heard; but when two or three families, who had made excurſions into the part of the country where Mr. Wilmot liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, thinking to give her pleaſure, was laviſh in the commendations of her old friend, ſhe felt a pang that ſhe with difficulty conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and from this moment ſuch are the bale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects of envy, experienced a decline in the affection ſhe had, till now, entertained for Maria.</p>
               <p>"During five years that had elaſped, ſince their ſeparation, letters had conſtantly paſt between them, but the correſpondence on the part of Charlotte now became leſs pleaſing: The moſt affectionate epiſtles lie unanſwered for months, and at laſt excited only a formal apology; this was by degrees omitted, and in the end the correſpondence ceaſed.</p>
               <p>"Among Mr. Graves' friends was an old Baronet, remarkable for his cheerfulneſs
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:030966_0194_0FE9FD0E7A99C138"/>
and good-humour; though upwards of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty, he was always the firſt to promote a party of pleaſure for the young people, and had for ſome time promiſed to give them a ball. The day was at laſt fixed, and all his young friends invited. Charlotte, among the reſt, was not a little pleaſed, to receive a card of invitation; ſhe immediately flew to conſult with her governeſs upon what dreſs ſhe ſhould appear in, being determined, ſhe ſaid, not to be outdone by any in the ball room. Mademoiſelle applauded her reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and tapping her on the cheek," ſaid, "it would be aſhame, if, with that pretty face, ſhe did not out ſhine every one there." The important matter was then entered upon, and ſupplied converſation till the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py day arrived; when, with all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages an expenſive dreſs could give to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon really handſome, though ſpoilt by affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and ſelf ſufficiency, ſhe cutered the ball-room, where a croud of young people, with happy countenances, were aſſembled.</p>
               <p>"The minuets being over, and country dances propoſed, a young lady of the moſt engaging aſpect was preſented by Sir Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am (for ſo the gentleman who gave the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment was called) to Charlotte for a partner. They went down ſeveral dances, to their mutual ſatisfaction, when Charlotte, underſtanding that her partner was a little
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:030966_0195_0FEA0E24931DEFA8"/>
indiſpoſed with the head-ache, propoſed that they ſhould deſiſt. This the young lady refuſed, till repeatedly aſſured it would be equally agreeable to her companion, when ſhe conſented, and they ſat down.</p>
               <p>"What delightful dancers," obſerved Miſs Shirley, for that was the name of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte's partner, "are thoſe two young ladies! It is impoſſible to imagine any thing more graceful than their movements; I have not been able to keep my eyes off them the whole evening."</p>
               <p>"Whether you think them fine dancers or not," replied Charlotte, "I will anſwer for it they think themſelves ſo."</p>
               <p>"There is nothing," returned the young lady, "aſſuming in their deportment, they appear to be perfectly modeſt and unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected."</p>
               <p>"Pſha," ſaid Charlotte, "it is eaſy to put on an air of modeſty; but I have known them long, and could always through that diſcover a great deal of arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and ſelf-conceit."</p>
               <p>"We ſhould endeavour to judge favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of every one," ſaid Miſs Shirley; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you wrong them?"</p>
               <p>"No," replied Charlotte; "I am ſeldom deceived in my opinion. They are twins; pray, do you think them handſome?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="unknown:030966_0196_0FEA0E263140E300"/>
"Yes," replied Miſs Shirley, "eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſhe in the white luteſtring; her eyes are beautiful."</p>
               <p>"Why, yes," rejoined Charlotte, "her eyes are certainly fine; but do you not think there is a little of the vixen in them? I have always obſerved, that where there is ſo much fine, the temper is turbulent."</p>
               <p>"It is illiberal," returned Miſs Shirley, "to form your opinion upon ſuch proof; how often do we find an amiable diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on concealed under the moſt irregular fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the reverſe where the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance promiſes every thing amiable?"</p>
               <p>"Your argument," replied Charlotte, "may hold good in ſome caſes; but, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon it, Mary Danvers is a vixen."</p>
               <p>"You are very ſevere," ſaid Miſs Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley; "but pray, do you not think the young lady, who ſtands next, very hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome?"</p>
               <p>"Yes," ſaid Charlotte, "if we give her credit for the white and red of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion."</p>
               <p>"What do you mean?" ſaid Miſs Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.</p>
               <p>"You know," replied Charlotte, "there is ſuch a thing as rouge and white paint."</p>
               <p>"I have heard ſo," returned the young lady.</p>
               <p>"I have been told," ſaid Charlotte,
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:030966_0197_0FEA0E2807C72278"/>
"that Miſs Fairfax ſometimes pays a viſit to her mamma's paint boxes."</p>
               <p>"And can you believe it?" ſaid Miſs Shirley. "How abſurd to ſuppoſe a girl of thirteen or fourteen (I am ſure ſhe does not appear to be older) would paint, or that her parents would permit her."</p>
               <p>"Such things," returned Charlotte, "do however happen: Why now, perhaps, you think the flaxen ringlets of her partner pure nature."</p>
               <p>"They appear to be ſo," ſaid Miſs Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley.</p>
               <p>"Ah," ſaid Charlotte, "appearances are often deceitful."</p>
               <p>"You are very ſatirical," ſaid Miſs Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley; "but here comes one in whom I think you muſt allow beauty of perſon and good ſenſe to unite.</p>
               <p>"Do you mean Lady Eliza Elwin?"</p>
               <p>"The ſame," ſaid Miſs Shirley; "you muſt confeſs that ſhe is very amiable and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, and as to beauty of perſon few can, I think, exceed her."</p>
               <p>"Why, Lady Eliza," returned Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte, "is certainly affable; her converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion too is what the world terms agreeable; though, in my opinion, not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

For my own part, I am not fond of thoſe ſleepy downcaſt eyes; I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuſpect that ſomething more is conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under them than people are aware of.

               <p>"Who," ſaid Mrs. Shirley, "may hope to eſcape, if Lady Eliza is cenſured ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly! She laſt year paſſed ſome weeks in Radnorſhire; I had, therefore, frequent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of meeting her, and, aſſure you, I found her a moſt amiable accompliſhed young lady; and as to her temper, I have been told by her moſt intimate friends, that few can boaſt one more equal."</p>
               <p>"I ſee," returned Charlotte, "that ſhe is a favorite of yours—we will, therefore, change the ſubject. Pray, did not you men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Radnorſhire? Do you reſide in that part of Wales?</p>
               <p>Miſs Shirley replied, that ſhe did; and added, it was ſcarcely a week ſince ſhe left it.</p>
               <p>"You are then acquainted, perhaps," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Charlotte, "with Miſs Wilmot?"</p>

                  <pb n="196" facs="unknown:030966_0199_0FEA0E2F154C29E8"/>
"O, you are intimate," interrupted Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte; I am rejoiced! I ſhall be glad to aſk a few queſtions about her—Pray, is it true that ſhe is ſo very accompliſhed, and ſo very handſome?"</p>
               <p>"I am an improper perſon," replied Miſs Shirley, "to give you information upon this point; for—"</p>
               <p>"Nay," interrupted Charlotte, who lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſound of her own voice better than that of any one's elſe, "ſince you are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, I could not have aſked one more proper. I ſee ſhe is not ſo great a favourite as Lady Eliza; but no matter, you have, I dare ſay, your reaſons; one cannot you know, be wholly blind to the faults of one's friends: in truth, we have all faults; ſome of one kind, and ſome of another, though none is, to be ſure, worſe than a covetous temper."</p>
               <p>"Do you mean," ſaid Miſs Shirley, "that Maria Wilmot is covetous?"</p>
               <p>"Somewhat that way inclined," return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Charlotte; "but, as I obſerved before, we have all our faults."</p>
               <p>"But my dear Miſs," ſaid Charlotte's part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, "with earneſtneſs, tell me, have you reaſon for entertaining ſuch an opinion? Surely, no heart, that is not loſt to every no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſentiment, can harbour ſo deſpicable a vice as covetouſneſs."</p>
               <p>Why, one would think ſo," returned

Charlotte: but it is I believe too true, that covetouſneſs is poor Maria Wilmot's failing; what is your opinion?"</p>
               <p>"I never thought it ſo," replied Miſs Shirley, "but 'tis poſſible I may be blinded by partiality."</p>
               <p>"Depend upon it," replied Charlotte, "you are; I could give you twenty inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of her ſtingineſs: Would you believe it, ſhe has never had a cap nor mantua made in London ſince her father retired into Wales! Now, as to taſte, I have been told ſhe has a great deal; therefore it can only proceed from her ſtingy diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>"But ſhe is at preſent young," returned Miſs Shirley, "and it is poſſible may not conduct theſe matters herſelf."</p>

               <p>"If that be the caſe," returned Miſs Shirley, "it behoves her to be cautious of abuſing the confidence he is ſo generous as to repoſe in her."</p>

               <p>"I have been told," replied Miſs Shirley, "that cards, and alſo raffling, as being a ſpecies of gaming, were two things to which her mamma had a particular objection."</p>
               <p>"But her mother has been dead theſe three years," replied the ungenerous Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte, "it is, therefore, very unlikely ſhe would be ſo ſcrupulous on that account: No, no, depend upon it, ſhe does not love to part with money. I'll tell you another anecdote I heard, upon authority equally as good, which proves her meanneſs beyond all diſpute.

In ſhort, you ſee ſhe is naturally covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and mean."</p>
               <p>"I hope," ſaid Miſs Shirley, "you do her injuſtice; but, if ſhe be really ſo, it would be kind to point out this as a part of her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, ſtanding in need of amendment."</p>
               <p>"It would be a glorious taſk," ſaid Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte, "to ſet about reforming the world. Why now, Maria Wilmot and I have from our infancy been friends, and till within theſe laſt two years correſpondents; but I—"</p>
               <p>Miſs Shirley looked aſtoniſhed—"Is it poſſible," ſaid ſhe, "that you can be Miſs Graves, the friend and correſpondent of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Wilmot?"</p>
               <p>"The very ſame," returned Charlotte; "but you ſeem ſurprized."</p>
               <p>"I," ſaid Miſs Shirley, "am really Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria Wilmot, your old friend and correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. My father has changed his name, on account of an eſtate that has been left him on that condition, which is the reaſon I am called Shirley.

               <p>Let the reader imagine what was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Charlotte, who had been unjuſtly ſtigmatizing her friend with ſo deſpicable a vice! She ſeemed rooted to the place

where ſhe ſtood, incapable of articulating a word either to vindicate or excuſe her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
               <p>"Miſs Shirley pitied and wiſhed to relieve her embarraſſment; but at this moment Sir William, accompanied by her father and Mr. Graves, who had juſt entered, came up to them. They ſoon underſtood that an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation had taken place between the young ladies, and told them, that having a mind to heighten the pleaſure of their meeting, after ſo long an abſence, by the ſurpriſe, they had purpoſely introduced them to each other as ſtrangers, and did not intend that the eclairciſſement ſhould have taken place, till they were all aſſembled at ſupper: "but," continued Mr. Graves, in a jocular ſtrain, "I find there is no poſſibility of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſecret where girls are concerned: you were determined to be before hand with us."</p>

She wiſhed to apologize to Miſs Shirley for the improper licence ſhe had given her tongue; but what could ſhe ſay? what excuſe could ſhe frame for an attack on her character, ſo unjuſt and unprovoked? She attempted more than once to enter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

on the ſubject; but her voice faltered—ſhe knew not where to begin, and at length, having for ſome hours laboured under the moſt uneaſy ſenſations, ſhe returned home full of ſhame and vexation. When retired to her chamber, ſhe had leiſure to reflect coolly on the occurrences of the evening, and could not but admire the conduct of Maria, who during the whole courſe of it, had generouſly endeavoured, by every kind and polite attention, to diſſipate her chagrin, and convince her ſhe harboured no reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on account of the paſt. "Maria," ſaid Charlotte, "is certainly very generous; how unfortunate that I ſhould not know her! If I had, this would not have happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; I ſhall in future be very cautious to whom, I expreſs my ſentiments.—Let me reflect.—What was it I did ſay?—O, that ſhe was covetous—Well, there is no great crime in that; becauſe it is very likely to be true: but then, as ſhe was my old friend, I ſhould not have pointed out her faults to another, and eſpecially to one who appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a ſtranger to me. I am perſuaded ſhe is ſtingy; but let her be what ſhe will, ſhe has certainly behaved to me this evening like an angel: how ſhe might have mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and expoſed me to every body! I am ſure, had I been in her place, and ſhe in mine, I ſhould have taken all the revenge I could,
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:030966_0205_0FEA0E39C6392F78"/>
I wiſh I had made ſome apology—I have a great inclination to go to-morrow morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and tell her I am ſorry for what I ſaid. I never did make conceſſions to any one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: but ſomehow I am uneaſy; I don't know what poſſeſſes me: I am half-inclined to love her—I wiſh I had not heard ſo much about her beauty and accompliſhments: it is a ſad thing to be envious!"</p>
               <p>"Fortunately for Charlotte, Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle had for ſome time left the family, and was gone to reſide with a relation in France: thoſe good impreſſions, therefore, which Charlotte had in her infancy imbibed, from the precepts and example of an amiable mother, and which, though ſtifled by flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and ill advice, were not eradicated, had time to operate. She roſe early in the morning, and prompt by a natural impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, which hurried on every impulſe of her mind, whether it was good or bad, ſhe ſet off, attended only by her maid, to Mr. Shirley's.</p>
               <p>"Maria happening this morning to riſe later than uſual, on account of a ſlight in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, had not left her chamber: Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte, therefore, on her arrival, was ſhewn into her friend's dreſſing room, when ſhe waited half an hour.</p>

reflections, that for once, in her life, ſhe caſt her eyes around, in purſuit of a book: not finding one to her purpoſe, ſhe ſo far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringed the rules of good-breeding, as to open a drawer, the key of which was turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in it found a ladies memorandum book: nothing could have ſuited her taſte better; ſhe unclaſped it, with an intent to peruſe the ſongs and enigma's, but in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over the leaves for this purpoſe, ſome memorandums in the hand-writing of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria caught her eye, and I am ſorry to ſay, ſhe was ſo indelicate to peruſe, among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other of the ſame kind, the following:

               <p>"O, my dear Miſs Shirley, my dear Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria," ſaid Charlotte, "this (pointing to the memorandum book) proves you to be every thing that is great and amiable: yet, even your juſtification covers me with ſhame, how mean muſt I appear in thus indelicately ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying my curioſity!"</p>
               <p>"A modeſt bluſh animated the blooming features of Maria, when ſhe underſtood, that memorandums, which were deſigned for her own peruſal, had been expoſed to the view of another. Both, though from differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent motives, appeared confuſed—and a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:030966_0209_0FEA0E4566548BB8"/>
of ſome moments enſued: it was at length broken by Maria: "Your curioſity, my dear," ſaid ſhe taking Charlotte by the hand, "is its own puniſhment, ſince my pocket-book contained ſo little to gratify it. With reſpect to myſelf, I am ſorry the peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of a few inſignificant memorandums ſhould expoſe me to encomiums of which I am ſo wholly undeſerving."</p>
               <p>"I ſincerely," ſaid Charlotte, "aſk your pardon for my indelicacy; but I cannot, in this inſtance, repent it. The peruſal of your memorandums, my dear, has taught me a leſſon, which, I hope, will be of ſervice to me throughout my whole life. O, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, what money have I not laviſhed in dreſs, trinkets, cards, and I know not how many frivolous things of the ſame kind, yet at this moment, cannot call to mind one ſingle action capable of affording me a pleaſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection!"</p>
               <p>"Perhaps," ſaid the gentle Maria, "you examine your actions with too great ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; my poor mamma uſed often to obſerve, that we all owe ſomething to the world, and to the character we ſupport in it: The large ſums, ſhe would ſay, daily expended on the table, wardrobe, and numerous retinue of a perſon of faſhion, would, it muſt be owned, more than decently ſupport many worthy indigent families, yet theſe, in the preſent
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:030966_0210_0FEA0E470B0D7F90"/>
ſtate of the world, are conſidered as the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary appendages of a high ſtation, nor are they, when proportioned to the fortune of the individual, at all hurtful to ſociety; they are, on the contrary, beneficial, as they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the means of ſubſiſtance to the ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ranks of mankind."</p>
               <p>"How kind!" ſaid Charlotte, "to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect this obſervation of your mamma, to apologize for my extravagance!"</p>
               <p>"Yet you," my dear Maria, "are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, I ſee, depriving yourſelf of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that you may diſtribute comforts to others."</p>
               <p>"You are miſtaken," ſaid Maria, "I ſometimes give up a leſſer pleaſure to enjoy a greater, that is all."</p>
               <p>"Do you then," ſaid Charlotte, "ſet no value on dreſs, and a thouſand other enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the money you appropriate to others, would purchaſe?"</p>
               <p>"Such low and frivolous enjoyments," ſaid Maria, "acquire all their value from our ignorance of higher; when once we have taſted the pleaſures that ſpring from acts of kindneſs and benevolence, be aſſured, my dear Charlotte, all other muſt fail in the compariſon."</p>
               <p>"How few girls of our age," ſaid Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte, "are there who think like you! yet how amiable do you appear! till compared
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:030966_0211_0FEA0E48E41CFAD8"/>
with yours, I never ſaw the deformity of my own conduct; I thought, if indeed I thought at all, that it was irreproachable; but you have undeceived me."</p>
               <p>"You aſcribe to me, my dear," ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, "much more merit than I deſerve; with reſpect to you and I, all that can be ſaid is, that we differ in our ideas of pleaſure; <hi>you</hi> have, perhaps, been told, that it is to be found in company and public amuſements, and I was early taught to ſeek it in retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, books, the ſociety of ſelect friends, and eſpecially in contributing to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of others."</p>
               <p>"I too," ſaid Charlotte, "will from this moment ceaſe to look for it elſewhere; you, my dear Maria, ſhall be the model by which I will endeavour to form my future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct."</p>
               <p>"You have choſen one very imperfect," ſaid the modeſt Maria.</p>
               <p>"Ah!" ſaid Charlotte, "what would I not attempt to regain your eſteem and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; I once poſſeſſed it, but the ill return I have long ſince made to your kindneſs, and above all the recollection of my conduct laſt night, muſt, in ſpight of your generoſity, cauſe you ever to deſpiſe me."</p>
               <p>"Do not," replied Maria, "wrong me or yourſelf by ſuch a ſuppoſition: I ſhould, I own, be guilty of great inſincerity, were I

to pretend, that my ſentiments in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, were the ſame laſt night, as they are at preſent: No, my friend; though willing to frame excuſes for a failing into which I was ſenſible, I might myſelf have fallen, had it not been for the admonitions of a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful mother, and, after her death, to thoſe of a father, who has made it the ſtudy of his life to form my heart and cultivate my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, yet, my dear Charlotte, pardon my freedom, when I found with what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure you pointed out blemiſhes in, and heard you indiſcriminately aſperſe the moſt fault<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs characters, I own I felt an indignation and diſguſt, of which I thought myſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable; but your candour, in thus frankly acknowledging your errors, muſt ſurely efface the remembrance of them, and entitle you to the eſteem of generous minds."</p>
               <p>"You, my dear Maria," ſaid Charlotte, "who are generoſity itſelf, may forgive me, but how can I ever be reconciled to myſelf! poor Miſs Fairfax, whoſe only fault, in my eyes, was that of being too lovely, what pains have I not taken to depreciate your beauty, by attributing to art what was pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the work of nature! How often have the elegant the unaſſuming Danvers' been the ſport of my unbridled tongue! The charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Lady Eliza Elwin too! whom envy it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf muſt ſurely admire, ſhe could not eſcape

the ſlander I indiſcriminately caſt upon all! and you, my trueſt my beſt friend, how readily did I aſcribe to covetouſneſs an econo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my which aroſe from the moſt worthy of motives!"</p>
               <p>"Do not," ſaid Maria, ſeeing Charlotte overwhelmed by the bitterneſs of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, "diſtreſs yourſelf by reverting with a ſeverity too great on your paſt errors; it is enough then you are ſenſible of them, and mean to make atonement by your fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conduct; remember them now only as they may be neceſſary to ſecure you from a relapſe, and to teach you, while you perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere yourſelf in the path of rectitude, to view with an eye of pity and compaſſion the failings of others. Detraction is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a deteſtable vice: my father has often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to me, that it comprehends many vices, particularly thoſe of envy and injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; "I never knew a perſon," ſays he, fond of detraction, that was not envious, nor did I ever find ſuch a one, in the leaſt ſcrupulous, whether he indulged this vice at the expence of innocence or guilt."</p>
               <p>"Surely," ſaid Charlotte, "I ſhall never more be guilty of it! 'Tis indeed odious! but I have ſo long indulged it, that, I fear, I ſhall find it difficult to overcome. You, my dear Maria, muſt be my conſtant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitor."</p>

                  <pb n="211" facs="unknown:030966_0214_0FEA0E50CC00CCB8"/>
"Alas!" ſaid Maria, "I am myſelf much in need of a monitor, but we will mutually aſſiſt each other."</p>
               <p>This intereſting converſation was here broken off by the entrance of Mr. Shirley, but Charlotte took the earlieſt opportunity of renewing it: from this moment, ſhe ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diouſly ſought to cultivate the friendſhip of Maria, by whoſe friendly admonitions ſhe learnt, in time, to view the perfections of others, without envy, to enjoy the world, without being enſlaved by it pleaſures, and to enſure her own happineſs by promoting that of others.</p>
               <p>"Clara, who, in the character of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte, ſaw her own ſtrongly depictured, doubted not, but that her aunt had ſelected the ſtory ſhe had juſt finiſhed to reprove and admoniſh her: ſhe was, therefore, ſilent, not knowing what to ſay; till her brother obſerved, what an odious character Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte's was, and applied to her for her opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion: ſhe then broke ſilence, and replied, "I am aſhamed to expreſs my hatred of a vice from which I myſelf am not free." Then looking ſignificantly at her aunt, "Ah, madam," ſhe added, "I fear I have loſt your good opinion—I was indeed very illi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral—I was too much like Charlotte in the ſtory—The only fault I could find in Miſs Reeve's work was, that it had too much merit."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="212" facs="unknown:030966_0215_0FEA0E5321F89820"/>
"My dear child," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "how I love this charming frankneſs! it is the preſage of every thing great and good: yes, my dear, I ſaw you were not uninfluenced by envy in your obſervations, and ſelected for the entertainment of the afternoon a ſtory, which I thought might ſerve to ſet ſo vile a paſſion in its true odious colours."</p>
               <p>"I ſee," ſaid Clara, "that envy is indeed a dreadful vice; I hope I am not ſo envious as Charlotte; but I own I do not like to hear other people praiſed."</p>
               <p>"That, my dear child," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "be aſſured, is a certain ſign that you are not without envy; be particularly cautious, therefore, of ſuffering it to take root in your heart; the firſt impreſſions may be eaſily ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced, but envy arrived at a certain height, is difficult to eradicate; a proper regimen may check the approach of a diſeaſe which, if ſuffered to gather ſtrength, will baffle the ſkill of the ableſt phyſician. The moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual barrier we can oppoſe to envy is a generous intereſt in the welfare of others; accuſtom yourſelf, my children, to liſten to the praiſes of your friends and acquaintances, point out their ſeveral merits and perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and, if you feel a tendency to envy, check it by reflecting that it ſprings from the moſt mean and baſe of all principles, ſelf-love."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="unknown:030966_0216_0FEA0E566AB307C0"/>
"I will endeavour, madam," ſaid Clara, "to follow your councils; for I am ſenſible that envy is an odious vice."</p>
               <p>"I do not," ſaid William, who, during this time, had liſtened with the utmoſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the converſation of his aunt and ſiſter, "recollect that I was ever diſpleaſed with any of my ſchool-fellows for excelling me: I always wiſhed to get up to them, and, if I could, before them. I hope, aunt, there is no harm in that."</p>
               <p>"No, my dear boy; what you experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced was emulation, a very noble paſſion, which prompts us to aſpire at excellence: Emulation, it is ſomewhere obſerved, ſtrives to excel by <hi>raiſing itſelf</hi> not by depreſſing others."</p>
               <p>"I ſhall be very careful, aunt, however," ſaid William, "leſt I ſhould be envious; I ſhall remember what you ſay, and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I am angry at hearing another praiſed, think it is high time to be upon my guard."</p>
               <p>"Dear William," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "be aſſured you will find an advantage in this; could young people know the pain and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery they would ſpare themſelves, by thus early checking the approach of envy and ſuch baſe paſſions, no perſuaſions would be neceſſary to lead them to adopt ſo ſalutary a courſe."</p>
               <p>The converſation now took a new turn,
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:030966_0217_0FEA0E58C3A14A70"/>
and different topics occupied the time till tea; after which, Mrs. Mills cauſed a large pair of globes to be brought, and entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her young friends with a variety of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious particulars, concerning the earth on which we live: ſhe deſcribed to them the cuſtoms and manners of its various inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and how, in the ſpace of twelve months, it performs its revolution round the ſun, cauſing the variation of the ſeaſons, and, by conſtantly turning on its axis, the change of day and night: ſhe the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"I am ſorry," ſaid her aunt, "to hear you pay ſo ill a compliment to the ſongſters of your own woods."</p>
               <p>"Nay, aunt," ſaid Clara, "you cannot think blackbirds and linnets, and ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon birds, worthy to be compared with the beautiful foreign birds we have ſeen in the aviary."</p>
               <p>"Their plumage may be inferior to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,"
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:030966_0219_0FEA0E5CD180CA08"/>
replied Mrs. Mills, "but what they want in feather, is amply compenſated by the melody of their notes; for my part, I do not envy the inhabitants of the eaſt, the glittering plumage of the peacock, bird of paradiſe, nor many more, while my ear is delighted by the charming melody of my native woods."</p>
               <p>"To be ſure," ſaid Clara, "our birds ſing delightfully; but you muſt allow, there is more to be admired where a beautiful plumage and a fine ſong is united."</p>
               <p>"That my dear," replied her aunt, "ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom happens: thoſe birds which have the moſt beautiful plumage are generally found to be defective in ſong; while others whoſe colours are leſs ſplendid raviſh us with the moſt delightful melody—You ſee how equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Providence diſtributes its gifts."</p>
               <p>"I ſhould like extremely," ſaid William, "to make a collection of foreign birds, to obſerve the curious things related of them. Do you know, madam, I yeſterday read, in a book that lay on your dreſſing-table, of a bird that has a pouch under its bill and throat, large enough to contain ten or fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen quarts of water!

               <p>"It is the Pelican," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "a native of Africa and America; the pouch you mention is a reſervoir for its proviſion,

which it afterwards caſts up and devours at leiſure. This peculiarity gave riſe to the fabulous ſtory, that the pelicans fed its young with its own blood."</p>

               <p>"You undoubtedly would," ſaid Mrs. Mills; "but as many foreign birds will not exiſt in our climate, and others muſt be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed at a large expence, I would remind you, that your own country will afford you no inconſiderable field for practical knowledge; I have given you more than one example of this."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Madam," ſaid Clara, "what you related of the bees was indeed very cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and the microſcope diſcovered many wonders."</p>

<pb n="218" facs="unknown:030966_0221_0FEA0E645C1CE258"/>
ſaid Mrs. Mills, "ſince theſe <hi>common</hi> birds are ſo familiar to you, obſerved the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of their neſts: Tell me, do you think you could form any thing ſo admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fitted to the purpoſe for which they are deſigned?"</p>
               <p>"The neſts," ſaid William—"The neſts—Why really I don't know—To be ſure, I have taken many, but I never paid much attention to any thing but the birds that were in them—I know they are made of graſs or moſs, or ſomething of that ſort."</p>
               <p>"Thus it is," ſaid his aunt, "that we daily paſs over a thouſand objects, which, if leſs familiar, would excite our higheſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration! But, my dear William, had I known you had ever committed ſo cruel a theft, I ſhould not have ſuſpected that you had ever conſidered attentively the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of a bird's neſt, and conſequently the labour it muſt have coſt the little war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler you deprived of it."</p>
               <p>William hung his head, and was ſilent—and Clara took this opportunity of enquiring whether all the birds of our woods built their neſts in the ſame manner?</p>
               <p>"All of the ſame ſpecies," Mrs. Mills re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "build invariably alike, but they vary according to their different kind: The wren, for example, builds her neſt in the form of a ſugar loaf, leaving a hole about
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:030966_0222_0FEA0E66026D7D90"/>
the middle for a paſſage in and out, through which ſhe not only ſupplies her young with food, but conveys out all their dung, which would otherwiſe ſoil the neſt.—The tit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſe curiouſly interweaves its neſt with moſs, hair, and reeds—The black-bird, lapwing, and many others, rough caſt the inſide of the neſt, with a lay of mortar, and by the help of a little flue or moſs, with which they temper it while ſoft, form a complete wall within.—Many birds connect the different parts of their neſt with a thread, which they weave from hemp or hair, but more commonly from the webs of ſpiders.—When the ſwallow has occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to build her neſt, ſhe wets her breaſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſurface of the water, and ſhedding the moiſture over the duſt, works it up with her bill, and thus forms a plaſter or cement, of which ſhe conſtructs a commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious habitation for her young family. The martin does the ſame, but covers her neſt at the top, leaving a hole at the ſide, for a paſſage in and out."</p>
               <p>"There is indeed," ſaid William, "great ingenuity in all this—it muſt coſt the little creatures great trouble and fatigue—I never thought about it before, but it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly cruel to deprive them of their little ones, after they have taken ſuch pains to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for their reception."</p>

"You would ſay ſo, William," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "if you knew all the cares they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo; as ſoon as the eggs, which are to produce the young birds, are laid, the male and female brood over them by turns, with the moſt painful perſeverance, and when the young family make their appearance, encounter every danger and fatigue to provide for their ſubſiſtence: they are conſtantly in purſuit of proviſions, firſt one and then the other, and ſometimes both together, and diſtribute the food they bring home with the greateſt equality."</p>
               <p>"I thought," ſaid Clara, "that all the care of hatching and rearing the young brood fell to the female."</p>
               <p>"It principally does," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "but the male has his part alſo: he allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates the fatigue of his faithful mate by a thouſand tender aſſiduities: while ſhe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the eggs, he brings her food, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally takes his turn in brooding them, and, when the young birds appear, ſhares equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with her the fatigue of providing them food: I had a male Canary bird, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the office of a very kind father to ſome young linnets."</p>
               <p>"To ſome young linnets madam!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the young people.</p>

As the miſchief could not be remedied, I admoniſhed him as to the future, and took the young neſtlings under my protection. The neſt had not been long in my dreſſing-room, before I obſerved that the chirping the little creatures made, either for food or the warmth of the mother, was anſwered by a fine Canary bird, which hung in the room, with that ſoft ſort of twittering birds uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make to their young. This inſpired me with the thought of trying whether he would rear the young linnets: I according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly put the neſt into the cage, and found the experiment ſucceed; my little Phily, for ſo I called my Canary bird, inſtantly left his perch, and brooded over the young linnets, as the mother would have done. I then put ſome proper food into the cage, and had the pleaſure of ſeeing him drop firſt a morſel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the mouth of one, then another, till he had ſatisfied the whole family, which he actually, in this manner, ſupported till they were capable of providing for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves."</p>

<pb n="222" facs="unknown:030966_0225_0FEA0E6DA9E2EE50"/>
to get a neſt of young birds, and try if they would do the ſame."</p>
               <p>"Be cautious," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "of trying the experiment, leſt the young birds ſuffer. 'Tis true, it has once ſucceeded, but that is no reaſon it ſhould always; tho' you have ſeen a cat foſter a chicken, ſuch another inſtance may not occur in the courſe of your life."</p>
               <p>"Pray, madam," ſaid William, "would Canary birds do you think live in our woods?"</p>
               <p>"By no means," rejoined Mrs. Mills, "our climate is by far too cold, great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and care is requiſite in the breed of them even in houſes."</p>
               <p>"But in the Canary Iſles," ſaid William, "I ſuppoſe they are as common as black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>birds and thruſhes are with us?"</p>
               <p>"Probably they are," ſaid Mrs. Mills; "but their colour there is a duſky grey, and they are ſo different from thoſe ſeen in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, that many people have doubted whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are of the ſame ſpecies. The Canary birds we ſee here are imported from Germany, where they are bred in great numbers, and ſold to different parts of Europe."</p>
               <p>"I have heard my dear mamma ſay," ſaid Clara, "that ſhe once ſaw a Canary bird perform a number of curious tricks,—

it fired a little cannon, fell down as if it were ſhot, and what was more wonderful, ſhewed the color of every perſon's gown in the room."</p>

               <p>"Dear Madam," ſaid Clara, "you ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize me very much! I think it muſt have been a very entertaining ſight."</p>
               <p>"It was beyond all doubt a miracle," rejoined Mrs. Mills, "but ſuch a one as the thinking mind could not contemplate with pleaſure; form to your idea the ſufferings of the little creature before it could be brought to perform <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Mrs. Mills, with her uſual affability, enquired into the different merits of the young people, and was extremely pleaſed, when Mrs. Brown replied, they were in general very good children: Obſerving one of them, however, ſet apart from the reſt, ſhe enquired into the cauſe, fearing perhaps that all was not ſo well as it ſhould be."</p>
               <p>The little girl, who was the ſubject of the enquiry, hung her head; her cheeks were immediately covered with bluſhes, and Mrs. Brown replied, "that Polly Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net was doing penance for a fault ſhe had committed three weeks ago, added, that ſhe had reaſon to hope ſhe ſincerely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented."</p>

The little girl upon this, burſt into tears, and aſſured her miſtreſs and Mrs. Mills, ſhe would never more be ſo wicked as to tell a lie.</p>
               <p>"I am ſorry," ſaid the lady, "to hear that you have ever been guilty of ſo great a crime; but as your preſent tears, and what your miſtreſs tells me, leads me to hope you are fully ſenſible of it, I ſhall not mortify you by any reflections."</p>
               <p>Clara and William, who were affected by the poor girl's tears, interceded for her very warmly, and requeſted Mrs. Brown, to mitigate her puniſhment, which they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, was to ſet apart from the reſt three weeks longer.</p>
               <p>"My good young lady and gentleman," ſaid Mrs. Brown, "I am ſorry to refuſe any requeſt you can make, but I am ſure, when you reflect on the greatneſs of the fault, and are told, that Polly Bennet had contracted a habit of telling untruths, you will think her puniſhment, in compariſon, very light."</p>
               <p>"The little girl ſaid, ſhe was ſenſible, ſhe deſerved to be puniſhed, and that ſhe ſhould not mind what ſhe ſuffered, if ſhe could but once gain the good opinion of her miſtreſs and ſchool fellows; the latter of whom, ſhe ſaid, ſhunned her as much out of ſchool as they did in."</p>

               <head>THE TRIUMPH OF TRUTH, A TALE.</head>
               <p>"Emily was the acknowledged child and heireſs of Sir James Golding, a wealthy ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet, in the weſt of England:</p>
               <p>"Amiable in her temper, gentle in her manners, beloved and admired by all who knew her, ſhe had reached her thirteenth year, a ſtranger to care or misfortune: then, for a while, the calm was interrupted, and ſhe was unexpectedly involved in a ſcene of trouble and perplexity.—A ſervant, for whom Emily had conceived a ſtrong affection, had for ſometime been declining in her health, and, at laſt grew ſo bad that her life was deſpaired of.</p>
               <p>"One day, as Emily was ſitting at her bed ſide, ſhe heaved a deep ſigh, and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the hand of her young miſtreſs, with a look that beſpoke a mind diſturbed and agonized," "my dear child," ſaid ſhe, "I have ſomething heavy at my heart, which I wiſh, yet dread to communicate—I have been very wicked, but what is done cannot be undone."</p>
               <p>"Emily begged ſhe would be compoſed, and tell her if there were any thing ſhe could do to relieve her mind."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="unknown:030966_0232_0FEA0E7EB016C698"/>
"Promiſe me," ſaid Alice, "that you will not diſcover to any one what I am now going to tell you; you are young, but have diſcretion above your years."</p>
               <p>"If it be a ſecret, that I can keep with honour," ſaid the prudent Emily, "depend upon my ſilence.</p>
               <p>"Alas," ſaid Alice, "it is of moment to your future peace and welfare; but tell me firſt, had you a mother, poor, mean, friendleſs, would you not turn from her with diſguſt and averſion?"</p>
               <p>"My good Alice," ſaid Emily, "whither does this queſtion lead: I was never ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to know a mother; but, if I were, can you ſuppoſe that poverty would not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear her to me?"</p>
               <p>"Amiable child!" exclaimed Alice, "in me then"—and here ſhe ſtopped—<q>in me then behold that unhappy mother.</q>
               </p>
               <p>"Theſe words were incomprehenſible to Emily; ſhe looked on Alice in ſilent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of what was to follow—but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe did not proceed—"Alice," ſaid ſhe, "what does all this mean? you are not light-headed, nor am I ſurely in a dream, yet how can I underſtand you! Did you not ſay ſomething of mother?"</p>
               <p>"I did," ſaid Alice, "I am indeed your unhappy mother."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="unknown:030966_0233_0FEA0E8382576168"/>
"Impoſſible!" exclaimed Emily, "my mother died when I was ſcarcely a fortnight old: you have ſome ſecret view in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truth, and want to impoſe on my credulity; my father, as ſoon as he returns, (for Sir James was out upon a journey) muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with this." Having ſaid thus, Emily was riſing with indignation, to leave the room, when Alice, collecting all her ſtrength, caught hold of her gown, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to be heard."</p>
               <q rend="inline normQuotes">
                  <p>Emily relented, and ſitting down once more, liſtened to a tale, that agitated her young heart with a thouſand new and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful emotions. The purport was this: Sir James, during his minority, had impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently contracted a ſecret marriage, and was ſhortly after obliged to ſet out upon his travels: this affected his poor lady ſo much, that ſhe lived only to become the mother of a fine girl, which ſhe committed to the care of Alice, who had formerly been her nurſe, and at whoſe houſe ſhe then lodged. Alice had unfortunately a little girl, within a few days of the ſame age, and this inſpired her with the wicked thought of aggrandizing her own child, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Sir James's. She accordingly gave it the name of Emily, after the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſed Lady Golding, and when Sir James, the following year, returned to England,
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:030966_0234_0FEA0E85211BF7A8"/>
impoſed it on him for his own offspring, which, in the mean time, ſhe called Patty, and bred up as her daughter. Ten years having elapſed ſince this tranſaction. Alice thought it time to profit by her wicked ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice; with this deſign ſhe offered herſelf to ſupply the place of Emily's maid, who had lately left the family, thinking, in this ſituation, to ingratiate herſelf by degrees into the affections of her young miſtreſs, and, when ſhe arrived at years of diſcretion, to intruſt her with the ſecret of her birth, and lay claim to her future ſervices, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the ſacrifice ſhe had made in her behalf, or, if this failed, to intimidate her by the fear of a diſcovery: Alice had, however, continued more than three years an inmate of the family, and had not yet ventured to entruſt Emily with a ſecret of ſuch importance. The proſpect, however, of her diſſolution, gave a new turn to her ideas, her crime now ſtood before her in its true deformity; ſhe reflected with anguiſh on the injuſtice ſhe had committed, and though ſhe had not courage to repair the injury ſhe had done, ſhe could not die in peace without recommending Patty, the injured daughter of Sir James, to the care and protection of Emily. Such were the motives which prompted this unhapy woman to the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhe had juſt made, and the reader muſt
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:030966_0235_0FEA0E878B65DCA8"/>
form to his imagination the effect it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced on the mind of Emily, ſince her emotions were too various, and too power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, for words to expreſs.</p>
                  <p>Shocked at the crime of which Alice had been guilty, yet impreſſed with a high ſenſe of the duty due to her, however faulty, as a parent, Emily could only weep, and in ſilence lament, till the entrance of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant afforded her an opportunity of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing, to calm the tumult of her mind.</p>
               </q>
               <p>"When Emily was alone, and began cooly to reflect on the events Alice had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded, her mind was ſtill more diſordered and perplexed:" "What a change," ſaid ſhe, "has a ſhort hour made! but now I thought myſelf the child of Sir James Golding, heireſs to a vaſt eſtate—what am I now? I am afraid to think—Alice, had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed reaſon to ſay the ſecret was of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance! Should Sir James diſcover it, what will become of me—of my poor mother—I tremble at the thought—but who will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him! Alice ſays my father is dead, no one but ſhe and myſelf know the truth—I will, therefore, think no more about it." Saying this, Emily went into the garden. and began to buſy herſelf about her flowers; from thence ſhe viſited her birds, hoping, by theſe means to divert her anxiety, but her thoughts inſenſibly returned to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:030966_0236_0FEA0E8C968E6DE8"/>
of her inquietude: "How can I," ſaid ſhe, "look my dear father, for ſhe could not forbear uſing the appellation, in the face, while I am poſſeſſed of ſuch a ſecret. Every kind word or look he addreſſes to me will reproach me—What can I do? Confeſs the truth to Sir James?—he is all kindneſs and indulgence now—but then—he will no longer love me, when he finds I am not his own Emily: I ſhall forever loſe his affection; that is hard, yet what is ſo bad as falſehood and deceit; it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly my duty to confeſs the truth; and how often, as my dear father told me, there is no ſatisfaction equal to the performing of it.—But will Alice conſent? ſhe is my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and I ought to obey her. I will try if I cannot prevail upon her."</p>
               <p>"When Emily returned to the chamber of Alice, ſhe took her hand affectionately between her's," how is it, my poor mother" ſaid ſhe, "are you more compoſed than when we laſt parted—have you ſlept?"</p>
               <p>"Alice replied, that it was long ſince ſhe had known compoſure;" "the injuſtice I have done," ſaid ſhe, "preſſes heavy on my heart, and I find, too late, that guilt brings along with it its own puniſhment."</p>
               <p>"Well my poor Alice," ſaid Emily, "make yourſelf eaſy, there is ſtill a remedy—confeſs the truth to Sir James, his child
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:030966_0237_0FEA0E8E3933D838"/>
ſtill lives, and he is very generous and kind—I am ſure I have always found him ſo."</p>
               <p>"What is it I hear!" exclaimed the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy woman; have you conſidered—"</p>
               <p>"I have conſidered every thing," ſaid Emily, "it is the only reparation you can make; and indeed you owe it both to Sir James, and Patty."</p>
               <p>"Think," ſaid Alice, who little expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſuch a propoſal, "what you will ſuffer, ſhould Sir James, which he certainly will, withdraw his protection from you; think how his confidence has been abuſed; in what a tender point he has been injured—indeed, my child, there is no hope of his forgiveneſs, though innocent, he will not conſider you leſs the cauſe of the impoſition which has been paſſed upon him, and will drive you out to ſhare the poverty of your unhappy mother."</p>
               <p>"I do not fear poverty," ſaid Emily, "for riches cannot afford ſatisfaction, if ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired unjuſtly; but I own, the thought of loſing my dear father's, I mean Sir James's affection, affects me ſenſibly;" yet, my dear mother, it is our duty to acquaint him with the truth, and let the conſequence be what they will, to perform it."</p>
               <p>"Alice ſeemed much agitated; for <hi>mine,</hi> if not for your own ſake," ſaid ſhe, "I charge
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:030966_0238_0FEA0E906AEA9E38"/>
you to keep the ſecret I have unfolded: I, at leaſt, muſt be the victim of Sir James's reſentment, and think what would enſue, were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>"This ſuggeſtion touched the tender heart of Emily: no, ſaid ſhe, "Sir James is generous; I will throw myſelf on my knees before him, and ſoften him in your behalf—if I fail, I will conſole you, work for you—and ſhare your poverty; I would not enjoy affluence, were it in my power, while my mother was in miſery."</p>
               <p>"Alice was affected, and half perſuaded, by theſe artleſs arguments. Emily obſerved it with joy, but fearing a continuance of the diſcourſe, would be too much for her, in her preſent weak condition, ſhe preſſed her for the preſent, no further, but promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to return in a ſhort time, left her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe."</p>

               <p>"Emily was ſhocked at this unexpected event; but it conſoled her to reflect, that ſhe had, in the laſt interview, apparently rendered her mother ſenſible that it was her duty to make the reparation that was ſtill in her power, though Providence had ſo ordered it that ſhe did not live to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it; that taſk now devolved upon Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and ſhe reſolved, painful as it might be to fulfil it—'Tis true ſhe was more than once tempted to purſue the oppoſite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct: "Patty," ſaid ſhe, "cannot feel the loſs of what ſhe never poſſeſſed, and does not know ſhe has a title to poſſeſs; when I am a woman, and have it in my power, I can be kind to her, and provide for her, and that will make her juſt as happy—Then, as to Sir James, he believes me to be his child, and I am ſure loves me as well; and with reſpect to myſelf, I think, I may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſay, Patty could not love and honour him more than I do."—Theſe ſuggeſtions, added to the fear of loſing Sir James's affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was inexpreſſibly dear to her, tempted her to confine the ſecret to her own breaſt; but truth, which ſhe had from her infancy been accuſtomed to prize as the

moſt valuable poſſeſſion, ſoon ſuggeſted bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thoughts, and ſhe reſolved to hazard all, rather than unjuſtly ſupport a character which did not belong to her. She, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, met Sir James upon his return the next day, fully reſolved to diſcloſe all, but with an embarraſſment, ariſing from the uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her mind, that did not eſcape his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. He enquired, with affectionate ſolicitude, if any thing material had happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his abſence?</p>
               <p>"Emily bluſhed, and replied, in a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulous voice: "Poor Alice, Sir, is dead."</p>
               <p>"Sir James was ſurpriſed, and enquired when ſhe expired?</p>
               <p>"Laſt night, Sir," ſaid Emily, "in my arms—" She could ſay no more, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the fortitude ſhe had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to aſſume; ſhe burſt into tears.—</p>
               <p>"My dear child," ſaid Sir James, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing her, "I do not blame this amiable tribute to the memory of poor Alice; but death is a debt we muſt all pay; I ſee your ſpirits are low, and for this the beſt remedy is employment: I have brought you a geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical game; let us ſee which of us will make the beſt and moſt expeditious tour of Europe." Saying this, he ſpread the map upon the table, and took out the totum and counters.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="unknown:030966_0241_0FEA0E996F845A38"/>
"Emily, at his deſire, ſat down, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to attend to the rules of the game, but her thoughts inſenſibly wandered, and her abſence of mind was ſo viſible, that Sir James was diſpleaſed.</p>
               <p>"Emily," ſaid he, "your concern for a faithful domeſtic is certainly amiable; but it ſhould not cauſe you to forget the attention and reſpect due a parent, who loves and ſtudies every thing to make you happy."</p>
               <p>"This was too much for the tender heart of Emily, already oppreſſed with a weight of grief entirely new to her; ſhe burſt into tears, and throwing herſelf upon her knees, and hiding her face with both her hands, entreated him to forgive her.</p>
               <p>"Sir James, aſtoniſhed at the agitation of her whole frame, raiſed, and preſſing her to his boſom: "Is it poſſible, my dear child," ſaid he, "that what I have ſaid ſhould affect you ſo powerfully!"</p>
               <p>"Ah, Sir," ſaid Emily, ſomewhat reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the tears ſhe had ſhed, "do not call me your dear child; indeed, I am unworthy that name."</p>
               <p>"Sir James was ſurpriſed; but knowing the ingenious diſpoſition of Emily, judged that her words alluded to ſome trifling fault ſhe had committed in his abſence, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured her of his forgiveneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="unknown:030966_0242_0FEA0E9B11ECB6F0"/>
"I am very unhappy," ſaid Emily "but thank God I have nothing to reproach my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with: O, my dear father!" (for, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to this epithet, ſhe unconſciouſly uſed it) "I am very miſerable—I fear you will never again call me your dear Emily.—Indeed, indeed, papa, I am not your own child."</p>
               <p>The reader will eaſily conceive what muſt have been the aſtoniſhment of Sir James: when Emily, as well as the agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of her mind would permit, related all the particulars before mentioned, and put into his hand a letter his lady had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to him a few days before her death, and committed to the care of the treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous Alice, who had withheld it, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of its deſcribing a particular mark which was viſible on the forehead of his child, and would naturally have been ſought for by Sir James.</p>
               <p>"His aſtoniſhment and indignation aroſe to the higheſt pitch—For ſome time he walked the room in the utmoſt perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mind—Then turning to Emily, who ſat in trembling expectation of the event, not daring to lift up her eyes to Sir James: "My deareſt child," ſaid he, "my thoughts are at this moment too much diſturbed to pay, as I ought, the juſt tribute to your noble conduct—Leave me for the
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:030966_0243_0FEA0E9D13AE7B90"/>
preſent—In the morning we will meet as uſual."</p>
               <p>"Emily withdrew to her chamber, much comforted by theſe kind expreſſions, which left her no room to apprehend the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sir James, and gave her reaſon to hope for a continuance of his favour.</p>
               <p>"When Emily the next morning was ſummoned to the breakfaſt table, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of the new character in which ſhe muſt appear to Sir James gave a timi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity and reſtraint to her manners that fully informed him of all that paſſed in her mind: "My dear Emily," ſaid he, taking her hand in the moſt affectionate manner, "why this reſerve? Can you imagine that an event in which you have borne no part, but what has ſerved to reflect on you the higheſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, can have leſſened my eſteem or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection? No, my dear, my noble girls, it has rather increaſed than diminiſhed both: From henceforth you can have no RIVAL in my affections, and Emily is too generous not to admit a partner."</p>
               <p>"As ſoon as breakfaſt was over, Sir James diſpatched Rugby, a faithful domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic who had grown old in his ſervice, to a village about ten miles diſtant, where Alice had placed Patty during her reſidence in Sir James' family, with orders to pay the money due for her board, and bring her
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:030966_0244_0FEA0E9FB706CAC0"/>
home.—Emily, in the mean while, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to her chamber, to enjoy the agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble reflections that aroſe upon her happineſs. How ſincerely did ſhe rejoice in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſhe had purſued! had ſhe acted with leſs integrity, how bitter had been her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections! For, with no ſmall ſurpriſe, ſhe learnt that the diſcourſe which had paſſed between her and Alice had been actually overheard, and when ſhe retired the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before, related to Sir James by Rugby, whoſe chamber was only divided by a thin partition from Alice's. Had Emily, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, acted upon principles leſs noble, the very means ſhe had taken to ſecure to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the fortune <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd eſteem of Sir James had irretrievably deprived her of both. She looked up, therefore, with gratitude to the Supreme Diſpoſer of events, who had inſpired her with reſolution to hazard the loſs of every worldly conſideration, rather than purchaſe them by duplicity and injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. From ſuch reflections her thoughts naturally turned upon Sir James; on his ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity and kindneſs—and then on Patty; "I am afraid," ſaid Emily, "ſhe is very illiterate, perhaps as ignorant and vulgar as our waſhing-woman's poor child: how it will vex and mortify my dear father—I wiſh he were not to ſee her till ſhe had been at ſchool a few months. But that cannot
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:030966_0245_0FEA0EA391D381D0"/>
be—If it were but poſſible to make her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear a little genteel before he ſees her—Let me ſee—Could not ſhe wear ſome of my cloaths—To be ſure—we are juſt of an age."</p>
               <p>"Emily was delighted with this thought—the moment ſhe ſaw Rugby, from the window, enter the court yard, ſhe flew to beg he would for a few minutes conceal his arrival from Sir James: Then, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, ſhe hurried with Patty into her chamber, where ſhe put on her one of her fineſt muſlin frock and a dimity ſkirt—and would have added a cap, had ſhe not been unwilling to conceal her beautiful auburn ringlets, which ſhe thought a greater orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>"The artleſs ſimplicity of Patty who viewed every thing ſhe ſaw with wonder and ruſtic admiration, and the generous anxiety of Emily to embelliſh the perſon of one, who, in a mind leſs noble, might have excited ſentiments of envy or jealouſy, formed the moſt intereſting contraſt.</p>
               <p>"The buſineſs of the toilet being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted, Emily led Patty to Sir James, who awaited her arrival with impatience. Upon her entrance, he was ſtruck with the ſtrong reſemblance ſhe bore to her mother, and embraced her with the tendereſt affection, ſhedding abundance of tears.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="unknown:030966_0246_0FEA0EA6001C2ED8"/>
"Patty was quite aſhamed to be kiſſed by ſo fine a gentleman: She had been told that Sir James was her father—but the diſtance that appeared between them, for the preſent, entirely excluded every ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feeling the name might be ſuppoſed to awaken, and glad would Patty have been to hide herſelf in any corner from Sir James.—This baſhfulneſs, however, in a few hours, wore away, and, in her artleſs obſervations, Sir James diſcovered a mind replete with good ſenſe.</p>
               <p>"What a mind," exclaimed Sir James, "is here loſt for want of culture!" Some more words he let fall that expreſſed the keenneſs of his ſenſations on this ſubject, which being obſerved by Patty, "Pray, Sir," ſaid ſhe, looking in his face, with a ſweet ſimplicity, "do not be angry with me—To be ſure, I cannot read—nor write—nor play on the muſic, as Miſs Emily can—but indeed I will love you—indeed, Sir, I will."</p>
               <p>"Sir James was affected by theſe artleſs expreſſions: "Do not, my ſweet child," ſaid he, "imagine I ſhall love you the leſs for the want of knowledge you have not the opportunities of acquiring: no, if you be good and teachable, you will be equally dear to my heart as if you poſſeſſed the moſt brilliant accompliſhments, which after
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:030966_0247_0FEA0EA862962FE0"/>
all, acquire value only from the virtues by which they are accompanied."</p>
               <p>"How happy it would make me," ſaid Emily, "to communicate to Miſs Gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the knowledge you, Sir, have been ſo kind as to give me! Will you permit me, (I will not ſay to be her tutoreſs, becauſe I am ſenſible I am in need of one myſelf) but to aſſiſt in ſo agreeable an employment? Patty has promiſed to accept my ſervices."</p>
               <p>"My dear children," ſaid Sir James, "nothing in this world can afford me ſuch heartfelt ſatisfaction as to ſee you amicably united: Yes, my dear Patty, if you would ſecure my eſteem and affection, Emily muſt be the pattern by which you muſt from your conduct."</p>
               <p>"Emily's eyes gliſtened with grateful ſenſibility at ſo high a mark of Sir James's approbation; and Patty, taking her hand, ſaid, "Indeed, Miſs Emily, I will mind whatever you ſay—and will love you dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for I am ſure you have already been very good to me;" (alluding to the change Emily had made in her apparel, a change which, as it gave another proof of Emily's noble ſentiments, had neither gone unnoticed nor unacknowledged by Sir James.)</p>
               <p>"From this day Emily became the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptreſs of Patty, whoſe attention and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication was ſuch, that ſhe improved
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:030966_0248_0FEA0EABF6E39AF0"/>
rapidly; her mind unfolded by degrees, and every day diſcovered new beauties; her baſhfulneſs changed into a becoming modeſty, and in a few years the ruſtic cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tager was loſt in the elegant, the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed Miſs Golding.</p>
               <p>"The particulars of Emily's birth was known, but to few; ſhe was ſtill conſidered as the daughter of Sir James, who divided his affection and fortune equally, between her and Patty. The friendſhip of the young ladies, being, in the mean while, founded upon reciprocal virtues, was ſtrengthened by time, and proved as laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as it was warm and ſincere."</p>
               <p>Thus was the virtue of Emily recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed by the approbation of her own heart—the eſteem of her benefactor—the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of a true friend—and the proſperity of her future life—illuſtrating this uſeful precept; that it is no leſs our intereſt, than our duty, to adopt and encourage good principles.</p>

               <p>CLARA and William were much enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with the ſtory their aunt had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and aſſured her, they would endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour

to cultivate the ſame integrity that had rendered the character of Emily ſo eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>The next day being Sunday, they attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their aunt to church, a place which Clara had hitherto conſidered as conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to lounge away a few hours, on a day the leaſt productive of amuſement of any throughout the week; ſhe had kneeled merely becauſe other people did ſo, and repeated the prayers from the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. During the ſermon and leſſons, ſhe was engaged in criticiſing the perſons and dreſs of the congregation, inſtead of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to the inſtructions contained in either; but a week paſſed with Mrs. Mills had produced a ſurpriſing revolution: The exemplary conduct of that lady—her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and the habit of aſſembling morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening to prayer, had impreſſed her with a high ſenſe of thoſe important duties ſhe owed to her Creator, whom ſhe now addreſſed with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ervent devotion: ſhe liſtened with attention to an excellent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, and retired convinced that ſhe was created for ſomething more than to dreſs, and trifle away her time in frivolous amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In their way home they viſited the Sunday ſchool, where Clara and her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſiſted their good aunt in examining ſome of the children, whom they rewarded
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:030966_0250_0FEA0EB1C6A14FB8"/>
and encouraged according to their ſeveral merits; a new ſpecies of employment this to the young people, who felt, that no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction can exceed that of rendering our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves uſeful to others.</p>
               <p>From hence the carriage conveyed them home, where they had the pleaſure of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. Clement, who had arrived a few minutes before. My dear ſiſter, my dear children, were alternately repeated—and then, a variety of intereſting ſubjects were diſcuſſed. Upon Mrs. Mills leaving the room for a few minutes, Mr. Clement ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to the young people, that he had not exceeded the time in which he promiſed to return.</p>
               <p>"Ah! papa," ſaid Clara, we are "al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways happy to ſee you; but I aſſure you, we ſhould be more ſo, if it were not to put an end to our viſit!"</p>
               <p>"How," ſaid Mr. Clement, "did you not bind me by a promiſe, that it ſhould not exceed a week!"</p>
               <p>"Very true, papa," returned Clara, but then we did not know my aunt, we could not have thought the time would have paſſed ſo delightfully."</p>
               <p>"I conclude then," ſaid Mr. Clement, meaning to banter, "that you have had balls, and cards, and viſits, in abundance."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="248" facs="unknown:030966_0251_0FEA0EB4333C45A0"/>
"O, no papa, not one," ſaid Clara, "and yet the time has fled ſo faſt, that I can ſcarcely believe it a week ſince you left us."</p>
               <p>"Nor I, papa," ſaid William, "and yet I have not had one play-fellow; nay, I have not ſo much as ſhot one marble; nor once flown my new kite."</p>
               <p>"This is very extraordinary," ſaid Mr. Clement, ſtill continuing to banter; "I cannot comprehend it."</p>
               <p>"O! papa," ſaid Clara, "my aunt is a charming woman, ſhe has been ſo good to us! ſhe has told us all about the bees; and you know, papa, how terrified I uſed to be at a ſpider; well, it is the moſt curious thing in the world! I have ſeen it ſpin; and how many threads do you think it takes to make one that forms the web."</p>
               <p>"Upon my word," ſaid Mr. Clement, I cannot exactly tell."</p>
               <p>"One thouſand! could you think it, papa?"</p>
               <p>"The bees," ſaid William, "delight me more than all; my aunt has a glaſs hive, papa, and we have ſeen them bring home the wax and honey."</p>
               <p>"But you forget the queen, William," interrupted Clara; <q>ſhe has a palace, papa, and her ſubjects are ſo faithful!</q>

                  <pb n="249" facs="unknown:030966_0252_0FEA0EB7F79A15C8"/>
"We have looked through my aunt's microſcope too; a fly, papa, is a moſt won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful creature! and the duſt on the wing of a butterfly is actually feathers."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!"</p>
               <p>"Yes, papa, and an earwig has two large wings, that fold up, juſt like our candle ſcreens. Did you know theſe things, pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa?"</p>
               <p>"I know," returned Mr. Clement, "that nature is replete with wonders."</p>
               <p>"How was it then, papa, that you never mentioned them to us?"</p>
               <p>"Your brother, my dear, ſaid Mr. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, has been abſent, and you never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered a deſire for information on ſuch ſubjects."</p>
               <p>"Becauſe, papa," interrupted Clara, "I thought it impoſſible to be amuſed without dreſs or company: but I ſee I was miſtaken, we have neither wanted the one nor the other here. My aunt has made us acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſo many curious things! and told us ſuch delightful ſtories! I wiſh, papa, you could let us ſtay another week? don't you, William?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, ſiſter," replied William, "if pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa can ſtay with us, but you know, I have been at ſchool ſix months, and have had very little of his company."</p>
               <p>"Very true," ſaid Clara, "I did not think of that, but if papa can ſtay with us?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="250" facs="unknown:030966_0253_0FEA0EBA704E0338"/>
"That is a pleaſure," ſaid Mr. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, "I cannot at preſent enjoy, as I have engaged your couſin Milfords to paſs a few weeks with us in town; we muſt ſet off to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow, that we may be at home to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them."</p>
               <p>At this moment Mrs. Mills entered; "my dear ſiſter," ſaid Mr. Clement, with a ſmile, "Clara and William have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting to me ſome of their newly acquired knowledge, and telling me how agreeably you have entertained them."</p>
               <p>"I am happ," returned Mrs. Mills, "if they think ſo."</p>
               <p>"We ſhould be very ungrateful, my dear Madam," ſaid Clara, "not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge your kindneſs, we have paſſed a moſt delightful week! Papa, I am ſenſible I have given you a great deal of uneaſineſs—I have been very idle, and inattentive; but I now ſee the value of knowledge, and am impatient till I have an opportunity of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toning for the time I have loſt."</p>
               <p>"How happy," ſaid Mr. Clement, "do you make me by the avowal of ſuch ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments! yes, my dear child, I have indeed, with concern, beheld your time daily waſted in frivolous and unprofitable amuſements, and have reproached myſelf as, in ſome meaſure, the cauſe, by improper indulgence: ſhall I confeſs the truth—I opened my heart

on this ſubject to your aunt, who kindly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited you hither, in the hope of inſpiring you with a taſte for moſt rational pleaſures: The diſguſt you conceived to the viſit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me (too much accuſtomed to indulge your inclinations) to limit it to a week; and little did I expect the happy change ſo ſhort a period has produced."</p>
               <p>"Then you knew, Madam," ſaid Clara, "how reluctantly I came hither? (Mrs. Mills ſmiled) and Clara rejoined, turning to her father, you ſhould not have told <hi>that,</hi> papa."</p>
               <p>"When we apply to the phyſician, Clara, for advice," returned Mr. Clement, with a ſmile, "he ſhould be fully informed of the complaint."</p>
               <p>"I was neither ſurpriſed nor offended, my love," ſaid Mrs. Mills; "the ideas natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excited by an old Gothic manſion, and a ſolitary aunt, accorded little with the ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs of youth; I wiſhed only to convince you, that knowledge and virtue, which give the principal charm to ſociety, can alſo ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the moſt dreary ſolitude agreeable, and that the rational and contemplative mind will draw to itſelf, from objects apparently the moſt inſignificant, a ſource of entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This being my deſign, I forbore to introduce you to ſeveral neighbouring fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, whoſe ſociety would have enlivened the
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:030966_0255_0FEA0EBEABABE2C8"/>
ſcene; I reſolved, in this viſit, that our pleaſures ſhould reſt more immediately upon ourſelves, and I hope, that the week has paſt neither unpleaſantly nor unprofitably."</p>
               <p>"No, indeed, Madam, ſaid the young people; the hours have only ſeemed to fly too faſt; Clara then added, "I had no idea that knowledge could be attained with ſo much eaſe; If I had, I ſhould not now, be ſo ignorant."</p>
               <p>"Do not deceive yourſelf, my dear" ſaid Mrs. Mills; "<hi>time, application,</hi> and <hi>perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,</hi> are neceſſary to the attainment of true knowledge: without theſe you will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire only that ſuperficial kind which, by rendering you conceited, will render you contemptible: My deſign, in our converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions this week, has been to awaken in your mind a taſte for rational ſtudies; 'tis yours to improve it by diligence and perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance."</p>
               <p>"Ah, my dear Madam," ſaid Clara, "had I you to inſtruct and adviſe me! but that cannot be; papa ſays we muſt really ſet off for town to-morrow morning."</p>
               <p>"I have been wiſhing," ſaid Mr. Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, "that it were poſſible to purchaſe a houſe within a ſhort ride—"</p>
               <p>"O! that would be delightful," exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the young people.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="unknown:030966_0256_0FEA0EC249F1CE90"/>
"I have a better plan," ſaid Mrs. Mills: "What ſhould prevent thoſe whom intereſt and inclination ſo cloſely unite making one family? This manſion is large enough to contain us all."</p>
               <p>"But, my dear ſiſter," ſaid Mr. Clement, "conſider—"</p>
               <p>"I gueſs your ſcruples," interrupted Mrs. Mills, "and am prepared to anſwer them. The obligation ſhall be mutual: In the ſummer you ſhall be my gueſt here, and in the winter I will be yours in Portland Place."</p>
               <p>"I am delighted with the propoſal," ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Mr. Clement; "but will you, my dear ſiſter, who have for years obſtinately ſecluded yourſelf in this retirement, conſent occaſionally to quit it, and mix again with the world?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, brother," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "what I have refuſed to the repeated ſolicitations of my friends, I now offer as a ſacrifice due to you and to theſe dear children: I feel that I can be uſeful to you both; my heart expands in the thought, and I no longer he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitate to purſue the path pointed out to me by new duties."</p>
               <p>"How, my dear ſiſter," ſaid Mr. Clement, "ſhall I expreſs the ſenſe I entertain of your kindneſs! how diſcharge ſo high an obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="254" facs="unknown:030966_0257_0FEA0EC51AA31398"/>
"There is little merit," ſaid Mrs. Mills, "in the performance of duties which coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide ſo powerfully with our inclinations."</p>
               <p>"And ſhall we really, madam," ſaid Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, "make but one family? What an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected happineſs!"</p>
               <p>"I too," ſaid William, "ſhall ſhare it with you, ſiſter, in the holidays."</p>
               <p>"It is my intention, William," ſaid Mr. Clement, "to take you from ſchool, and to receive a gentleman, with whom I am in treaty, into my family, as tutor to you."</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid William, ſtarting up in an ecſtacy, "that indeed will be charming! You ſhall ſee, father, how attentive and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent I will be; I ſhall be ſo happy to live at home with you, and my aunt, and my ſiſter!"</p>
               <p>The day paſſed thus inſenſibly away, and the next morning, at an early hour, Mr. Clement, with his ſon and daughter, ſet out for London: They bade a cheerful farewel to Mrs. Mills, in the full aſſurance of a ſpeedy return, which took place in the courſe of a few weeks, when having enjoyed the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the country, at the cloſe of the year, Mr. Clement had the pleaſure of conducting his ſiſter, after an abſence of more than twelve years, to the metropolis—From this time the families were united.</p>
               <p>Clara, conſcious of her imperfections, by diligence and attention, corrected them; ſhe
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:030966_0258_0FEA0EC6B8E2DDC0"/>
became gentle, amiable, and accompliſhed; and Mrs. Mills, in whom ſhe ever found an affectionate friend and a faithful counſellor, had, in time, the happineſs of ſeeing eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry female excellence united in her character.—William too, under a judicious preceptor, aſſiſted by the counſels of his father became a worthy man, and an elegantly accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſcholar.</p>
               <p>Thus William and Clara, by their conduct, conſtituted the happineſs of a parent and a friend, whom they loved and honored: To the end of their lives, they looked back with pleaſure on the week which had taught them the <hi>importance of time;</hi> and convinced them, that it can be no way ſo well improved as in the <hi>practice of virtue,</hi> and the <hi>acquirement of uſeful knowledge.</hi>
