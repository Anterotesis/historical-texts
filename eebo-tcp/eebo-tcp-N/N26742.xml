            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE GEORGIA SALES ON THE MISSISSIPPI CONSIDERED &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE Opinion of counſel is required on the following points.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. Whether any claims of the United States can affect the purchaſes of land made from the ſtate of Georgia in 1795, by the Upper Miſſiſippi and Georgia Companies or either of them?</item>
               <item>II. Whether thoſe purchaſes can be affected by the Act of the Georgia legiſlature paſſed Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary 3, 1796, and commonly called the Repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Act?</item>
            </list>
            <p>In anſwering the firſt of theſe queſtions it will be proper to conſider the claims of the United States under two points of view; firſt as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the ſtate of Georgia itſelf; and ſecondly, as they reſpect the purchaſers under the ſtate. For, though in general, purchaſers ſtand, as to all legal intents, in the ſame ſituation with the ſeller, there may be particular circumſtances which will create a wide difference between them. It will be proper to enquire whether theſe lands or any part of them belonged to the United States at the time of the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:035588_0004_1005F742584C2760"/>ſale? and, in that caſe, whether it was attended or preceded by any conduct on their part, which will render it valid againſt them in the eye of the law?</p>
            <p>In diſcuſſing the queſtion "Whether any part of theſe lands belonged to the United States at the time of the ſale" we muſt carry back our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the firſt diſcovery of North-America, and take a review of the various public acts by which the rights of ſoil and jurisdiction, to that part of it where the lands in queſtion lie, have been affected from that period to the preſent time. Such other tranſactions as it may be neceſſary to recur to in other parts of the inveſtigation, though they have no immediate relation to this point, will, for the ſake of perſpicuity, be noticed in the order in which they occurred.</p>
            <p>It was a principle admitted by all the European nations in the eſtabliſhment and regulation of their American colonies, that prior diſcovery, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by actual occupation, and, in ſome caſes, without it, veſted the right of ſoil and juriſdiction. Spain thus acquired her extenſive dominions in South-America; and by the ſame ſide ſhe laid claim to Florida in the ſouthern parts of the North-American continent. England, alſo, by virtue of diſcoveries made under her flag in the reign of Henry VII. claimed the whole extent of North-America from Florida to Hudſon's bay. The boundary between her diſcoveries and Florida re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained for a long time uncertain, and was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the ſubject of diſpute between the two crowns. She claimed, however, as far ſouth as the latitude twenty-nine; and Spain at length ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded Florida to her, which put an end to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
            <p>England made ſettlements, at a very early pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, in the northern and middle parts of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:035588_0005_1005F744F3A75F98"/>region, and erected governments which now compoſe the ſtates from Virginia to New-Hampſhire, incluſive. Theſe governments were of two kinds, royal and proprietary. In the former the right of ſoil and juriſdiction remained in the crown; and their boundaries, though deſcribed by its letters patent, were ſubject to alteration at its pleaſure: for, as it poſſeſſed the rights of ſoil and government, and delegated them to its gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, during pleaſure, it might diſpoſe of them in what manner and to whom it thought fit, might al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, extend, or abridge the delegation as its incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or policy might dictate. In the latter, the proprietary governments, the right of ſoil as well juriſdiction was veſted in the proprietors. Their charters were in the nature of grants, and their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits being fixed by theſe charters could not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered but by their own conſent. This diſtinction is particularly noticed here, becauſe in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the diſcuſſion it will appear to be of very great importance.</p>
            <p>Moſt of the governments were at firſt proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary; but, in progreſs of time, the greater part of them, either by the forfeiture or ſurrender of the charters, became royal.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe charters, under which any ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement took place, was given by Queen Elizabeth to Sir Walter Raleigh in the year 1584<note n="*" place="bottom">Hazard's collection, 33.</note>. Like the previous charters from her and Henry VII. to Cabot, Sir Humphrey Gilbert and others<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. 9, 11, 24.</note>, it was merely a commiſſion to diſcover any countries not occupied by Chriſtian people, to take poſſeſſion of them, and form ſettlements under the allegiance of the crown of England. It alſo prohibited any other perſons from ſettling within two hundred
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:035588_0006_1005F7468572E9A8"/>miles of any place where he ſhould <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>, "within ſix years." Under this charter he made two ſettlements: one ſouth of the Cheſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peake, compoſed of about one hundred perſons, who arrived in June 1585, and returned to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in the June following: the other near the mouth of James' river, and conſiſting of about the ſame number of ſettlers, who arrived in the year 1587, and continued there. In the title of the charter it is ſaid that it ſhall continue in force for ſix years, and no more; but in the body of it there is no limitation. In the year 1603<note n="*" place="bottom">State trials, vol. i. p. 186.</note>, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it was forfeited by the attainder of ſir Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Raleigh, for treaſon, and the right re-veſted in the crown.</p>
            <p>In the year 1606, James I. by his letters pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent dated April 10<note n="†" place="bottom">Hazards col. 50.</note>, gave permiſſion to two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies to form ſettlements on any part of the coaſt of North-America, between latitudes 34 and 45. Theſe companies were denominated the firſt and ſecond colonies of Virginia: The firſt was to make its ſettlements between 34 and 41 degrees of lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, the ſecond between 38 and 45. Neither was to ſettle within two hundred miles of any place previouſly ſettled by the other. Each was to poſſeſs all the lands along the coaſt fifty miles in both directions from the place of its firſt ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, one hundred miles back into the country, and all the iſlands within one hundred miles of the coaſt. A council was appointed for the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of each colony, and it was provided that all the lands contained within the above mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed limits ſhould, on petition to the crown, be grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuch perſons as the reſpective councils ſhould recommend.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:035588_0007_1005F748ED9B6E28"/>
It does not appear that any ſuch grants were ever made; but James I. by letters patent, dated May 23, 1609<note n="*" place="bottom">Hazardss col. 58.</note>, ſeparated the firſt colony from the ſecond, and, on the petition of the perſons compoſing it, erected them and a number of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers into a corporation under the name of "The treaſurer and a company of adventurers and plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the city of London, for the firſt colony of Virginia." All the lands along the coaſt, two hundred miles ſouth, and an equal diſtance north, of point Comfort, and extending weſt to the South-Sea, with the iſlands within one Hundred miles of the coaſt, were granted to this company, commonly called the London company, and their ſucceſſors, in fee ſimple; in truſt however, to be diſtributed among ſettlers: and the powers of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment were veſted in two councils, one in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and one in America.</p>
            <p>Point Comfort being about latitude 36, 30, the limits of this charter muſt have extended ſouth to about latitude 33. It is not eaſy to determine whether the government erected by it ought to be conſidered as royal or proprietary; but it has more the appearance of the former.</p>
            <p>On the 12, of March 1612<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. 72.</note>, James I. granted another charter to the London company, which confirms the former, and adds to their territories all the iſlands within 300 leagues of the lands for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly granted to them, and between the 30, and 41, degrees of latitude.</p>
            <p>The company continued to exerciſe the powers of government, and diſpoſe of the rights of ſoil, within the limits allotted to them, till about the year 1624, when the affairs of the colony appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be badly conducted, their charters were
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:035588_0008_1005F74B7A0973D0"/>forfeited by quo warranto<note n="*" place="bottom">Hazard's col. 83.89.</note>, and the government with all the rights of ſoil and juriſdiction taken into the hands of the crown. By this reſumption Virginia became, if it were not ſo before, a royal government; and its boundaries became liable to abridgment or alteration of the pleaſure of the monarch.</p>
            <p>The rights of ſoil and juriſdiction in all the lands ſouth of the Cheſapeake, not actually appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated being thus re-veſted in the crown, king Charles I. made a grant to ſir Robert Heath, his attorney general, extending from the 30, to the 36, degree of latitude north<note n="†" place="bottom">Att. gen. report, 28.</note>. This grant was ever afterwards conſidered as void, but whether by ſurrender, nor uſer, or in what other manner, does not appear.</p>
            <p>The next grant of this country was by Charles II. to lord Clarendon and others bearing date March 24, 1662. It included "all that territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or tract of ground ſituate, lying and being, within his ſaid majeſty's dominions in America, extending from the north end of the iſland called Lucker iſland, which lyeth in the northern Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia ſeas, and within ſix and thirty degrees of the northern latitude, and to the weſt as far as the South-Seas, and ſo ſoutherly as far as the river St. Matthias which bordereth upon the coaſt of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida, and within one-and-thirty degrees of nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern latitude, and ſo within a direct line as far as the South-Seas aforeſaid." Theſe grantees were afterwards called "Lords Proprietors," and the country contained within their boundaries was erected by the charter into a province, under the name of "Carolina." Extenſive immunities were conferred on ſettlers, and the rights of ſoil and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035588_0009_1005F74EF152F400"/>government, were veſted in the proprietors in fee ſimple.</p>
            <p>By another charter from Charles II. bearing date June 30, 1664, the former was confirmed, and its limits extended from latitude 36, 30 to latitude 29 incluſive, and from thoſe points due weſt to the South-Sea.<note n="*" place="bottom">Att. gen. report, 47.</note>
            </p>
            <p>On the 25, of July 1726, the lords proprietors by deed duly executed, ſurrendered to the crown all their rights under theſe charters<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. 44.72.</note>, lord Carteret alone one of the number, retained his ſhare, and it was afterwards ſeparately alloted to him in the northern parts of the province. The ſurrender was accepted and confirmed by act of parliament, and by virtue of it Carolina became a royal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. It was afterwards divided into two provinces, called North and South-Carolina, by a line beginning at the north end of long Bay, and running thence north-weſt to the latitude 35, and thence due weſt to the South-Sea; lord Carteret, better known by the name of lord Granville, had his part laid off in North-Carolina</p>
            <p>George II. by letters patent bearing date on the 9, of June 1732<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. 91.97.</note>, erected lord Dereival James Og<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lethorpe and others, into a corporation under the title of the <q>Truſtees for eſtabliſhing the colony of Georgia in America,</q> and granted to them and their ſucceſſors, in truſt for future ſettlers, all thoſe lands countries and territories, ſituate, lying and being, in that part of South-Carolina in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, which lies from the northern ſtream of a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, there commonly called the Savannah, all along the ſea coaſt to the ſouthward unto the moſt ſouthern ſtream of a certain other great water or river called the Alatamaha, and weſtward from
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:035588_0010_1005F75173AE5CA8"/>the heads of the ſaid river, reſpecttively, in direct lines to the South Seas. This country was erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a province called "Georgia," and power was given to the truſtees for twenty-one years to frame laws and regulations for its government; after which all the rights of ſoil and juriſdiction were to veſt in the crown.</p>
            <p>Under this charter Oglethorpe took poſſeſſion of the country for the truſtees and made ſeveral ſettlements: and in the year 1752, the truſtees by deed duly executed, ſurrendered their charter to the crown<note n="*" place="bottom">Att gen. report, 97.</note>, Georgia therefrom bcame a royal government.</p>
            <p>By the treaty of Paris in 1763, Spain ceded to Great-Britain, Florida, Penſacola, and, in general, all that ſhe held in North-America eaſt and ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſt of the river Miſſiſſippi: and a line drawn down that river from its ſource to the ſéa, was eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the weſtern boundary of the Britiſh domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions<note n="†" place="bottom">See an extract from the treaty, appendix, No. 1</note>.</p>
            <p>Soon after this ceſſion the Britiſh government, by a proclamation for the regulation of its colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies being dated October 7, 1763, errcted Florida into two governments called Eaſt and Weſt Florida. They were divided from each other by the Ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latchicola river; and the latter was bounded by the gulph of Mexico on the ſouth, on the weſt by lakes Pontchartrain and Maurepas, and the river Miſſiſſippi, and on the north by a line drawn from that part of the river Miſſiſſippi which is interſect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by latitude 31, due eaſt to the Apilachicola. The northern boundary of Eaſt Florida was a line drawn from the confluence of the Chatahocchee and Flint rivers, where they form the Apilachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:035588_0011_1005F753064F5370"/>to the head of the St. Mary's, and down it to the ſea.</p>
            <p>Diſputes in the mean time having ariſen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the governments of South-Carolina and Georgia, about the lands, lying between the Ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamoha and St. Mary's, they were, by this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, annexed to Georgia<note n="*" place="bottom">See the proclamation, Appendix, No. 2.</note>, whoſe ſouthern boundary, ſtretching only to the Alatamoha by its original charter, was thus extended to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver St. Mary's.</p>
            <p>The proclamation alſo contains a clauſe, "Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving under the ſovereignty, protection and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the crown, for the uſe of the Indians, all the land and territories not included within the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the governments thereby erected, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits of the territory granted to the Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons Bay company; <hi>as alſo all the lands and territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries lying to the weſtward of the ſources of the rivers which fall into the ſea from the weſt and north-weſt,"</hi> and it forbids "the governors of all the colonies to grant warrants of ſurvey, or paſs patents, for any lands beyond the heads of theſe rivers, till the further pleaſure of the crown ſhould be known."</p>
            <p>When the firſt Britiſh governor took poſſeſſion of Weſt Florida he found its limits to the north ſo contracted as to cut him off from the moſt fertile and healthy lands, and even to exclude from his province ſome very conſiderable ſettlements, which had been formed under it, and made part of it, while ſubject to Spaniſh government. He made a repreſentation of theſe circumſtances to the crown<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. No. 3.</note>. It was referred to the board of trade and plantations; and by their advice the province was extended to the north, "By a line drawn from the north of the Yazoo river where it unites
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:035588_0012_1005F75678CDCF20"/>with the Miſſiſſippi, due eaſt to the Apilachicola." This extenſion, which took place before the year 1770, was not made by proclamation, but by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to the governors of that province, and their commiſſions<note n="*" place="bottom">See appendix No. 4. An extract from the inſtructions to governor Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It is not known that any copy of any other of theſe inſtructions or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions exiſt in America. See alſo Att. gen. report, 21.</note>. They went on to exerciſe ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction and grant lands in the country thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next to their government, till it was ceded to the United States by Great-Britain, at the peace of 1783.</p>
            <p>When the Britiſh colonies, including South-Carolina and Georgia, diſſolved their connection with the mother country in the year 1776, and erected themſelves into independent ſtates, they agreed that each ſhould hold by its former limits; that each ſtate ſhould poſſeſs the ſame extent of territory that had belonged to it while a colony. This indeed was not readily contented to: for as the limits of ſeveral colonies, as Maſſachuſetts, Connecticut, New-York, Pennſylvania, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina and Georgia, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a great extent of unſettled country, while others, as New-Hampſhire, Rhode-Iſland, Jerſey, Delaware, and Maryland, poſſeſſed little or none, the latter contended that theſe unſettled lands ſhould be conſidered as a common property among all the ſtates, and appropriated for their mutual benefit; and ſome of them, particularly Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, refuſed to accede to the union, until ſome of thoſe ſtates which poſſeſſed the moſt extenſive limits, ſhould relinquiſh a part of their claims for this purpoſe. This was at length done; Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, Connecticut, New-York, and Virginia, made relinquiſhments, retaining however very conſiderable portions of the land in queſtion. The
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:035588_0013_1005F758D59A0398"/>articles of confederation were then ratified, leaving all thoſe ſtates which had made no relinquiſhment in the quiet poſſeſſion of the whole territory com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized within their ancient limits. Of this number was Georgia; which was ſo far from relinquiſhing, that on February 7, 1783 ſhe paſſed an act aſſerting that her juriſdiction and right of ſoil extended "over all the country between the Miſſiſippi, the Atlantic, the ſouthern boundary of the United States as eſtabliſhed by the treaty of peace, and the Southern boundary of North-Carolina.</p>
            <p>By another act paſſed February 7, 1785 ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to exerciſe the rights which ſhe had thus aſſerted. It was thereby enacted "That all the country contained within a line to be drawn down the Miſſiſſippi from where it receives the Yazoo, till it interſects the 31ſt degree of North latitude, then due eaſt as far as the lands might be found to reach which had at any time been relinquiſhed by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, then along the line of relinquiſhment to the river Yazoo, and down it to its mouth, ſhould be erected into a county called Bourbon, and that when the land-office ſhould be opened, all perſons previouſly ſettled there ſhould have the right of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption at one fourth of a dollar per acre."</p>
            <p>Under this act, commonly called the Bourbon county act, no ſettlements were ever made. The relinquiſhment of land which is ſpoken of in it took place at Mobile in May 1777, by virtue of a treaty between the Choctaw nation, to whom that country then belonged, and the Britiſh ſuperinten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant of Indian affairs, and was confirmed by the treaty between thoſe Indians and the United States held at Hopewell on the 3d of January 1786. It extended from the mouth of the Yazoo 110 miles
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:035588_0014_1005F75A637D7AD0"/>down the Miſſiſippi; at the upper end it was 15, at the lower 60 miles broad.</p>
            <p>About the ſame time a diſpute aroſe between the ſtates of South-Carolina and Georgia reſpecting their boundaries. South-Carolina contended that as the original boundaries of Georgia were the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Savannah and Alatahama, and lines drawn due weſt from their ſources to the Miſſiſſippi, all the land lying ſouth of the Alatamaha and of a line drawn due weſt from its ſource to the Miſſiſippi, as far as to the northern boundary of the Floridas, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to be a part of the province of South Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, out of which Georgia was taken: and that when the Britiſh crown, by its proclamation of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober 7, 1763, annexed to Georgia, "all the lands lying between the rivers Alatemaha and St. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's" it meant only the lands actually between thoſe rivers below their ſources, and not ſuch as lay above thoſe ſources, and between lines drawn from them reſpectively weſt to the Miſſiſippi; which tracts of country, of courſe, even after the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, ſtill continued a part of South Carolina. Georgia, on the contrary, maintained that when the proclamation annexed to its governmeet "all the lands lying between the rivers Alatamaha and St. Mary's it meant to include not merely the tract of country which lay between thoſe rivers, below their ſources, but alſo the whole territory held by the Britiſh crown between the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern boundaries of the Floridas, as eſtabliſhed by the ſame proclamation, and the ancient ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern line of Georgia. This diſpute was referred to congreſs under the articles of confederation by a petition from South-Carolina<note n="*" place="bottom">Journals of Con. vol. x. p. 190.</note>. A court was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and a day fixed for a hearing between the two ſtates. But they afterwards agreed to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035588_0015_1005F75D17AFC050"/>the petition and ſettle the matter by negociation<note n="*" place="bottom">Jour. Con. Vol. xi. p. 218.</note>. Their commiſſioners met at Beaufort in South-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina for this purpoſe and on the 24th of April, 1787, agreed on a convention by which that ſtate relinquiſhed the claim. On the 29th of February 1788 this convention was ratified by an act of the legiſlature. It had previouſly been laid before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs and filed among the official papers of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited ſtates<note n="†" place="bottom">Vol xii. p. 130. See alſo appendix, No. 7.</note>.</p>
            <p>On the 21ſt of December 1789, the legiſlature of Georgia paſſed an act for ſelling all this country from the mouth of Coles creek, which is a little a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Natches, to latitude 35, and from the Miſſiſſippi to the Donbigby. Two companies were to be the purchaſers, one called the South-Caroli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, the other the Virginia Yazoo company; and they were allowed a pre-emption of two years, on their making the ſtipulated payments, within which periods they were to receive grants. But a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute having ariſen between them and the ſtate about the mode of payment, the pre-emption expired without payments having actually been made, and no grants were paſſed<note n="‡" place="bottom">See the act—appendix, No. 8.</note>.</p>
            <p>On the 7th of December 1793 a repreſentation was preſented to the court of Spain on the part of our government, in which the diſpute between us and that power reſpecting boundary was ſtated, and our claim ſupported. This repreſentation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts on the latitude 31. as the Southern boundary of <hi>Georgia,</hi> and reſts our title to the diſputed terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory which lay above that latitude, entirely on the right of that ſtate<note n="‖" place="bottom">See appendix No 9—an extract from the repreſentation.</note>. Indeed it is of importance to remark here, that in the whole progreſs of this diſpute, which being definitively ſettled by the late
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035588_0016_1005F760E5C88028"/>treaty between the United States and Spain, need not now be diſcuſſed, our government held up the right of the ſtate of Georgia to the territory above latitude 31, as altogether indiſputable, and made that right the ſole foundation of its own preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions<note n="*" place="bottom">Se appendix No. 10—An extract from the report of the Secretary of ſtate to the Preſident, which was the baſis of the inſtructions to the commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners at Madrid.</note>.</p>
            <p>On the ſeventh of January 1795, the legiſlature of Georgia paſſed an act for ſelling parts of the territory on the Miſſiſſippi, above latitude 31, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral companies, one of which was called the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Miſſiſſippi, and another the Georgia company. Theſe are the companies whoſe rights are the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the preſent inveſtigation. The land allotted to the firſt was directed to be bounded by a line "Beginning at the Miſſiſſippi river where the northern boundary line of this ſtate (Georgia) ſtrikes the ſame: thence along the ſaid boundary line due eaſt to the Teneſſee river; thence along the ſaid Teneſſee river to the mouth of Bear Creek'; thence up Bear Creek, to where the parrallel of latitude twenty-five Britiſh ſtatute miles ſouth of the northern boundary aforeſaid ſtrikes the ſame; thence along the ſaid laſt mentioned parrallel of latitude, acroſs Tombigby or twenty mile creek, due weſt to the Miſſiſſippi river; thence up the middle of the ſaid river to the beginning." The boundaries of the Georgia company were a line, "beginning on the Mobile Bay, where the latitude 31, degrees north of the equator interſects the ſame, and running up the ſaid Bay to the mouth of the lake Tenſaw; thence up the ſaid lake Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw to the. Alabama river, including currys and all other iſlands therein; thence up the Alabama to the junction of the Cooſa and Danfuſkee rivers;
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035588_0017_1005F76336D4E168"/>thence up the Cooſa river, above the big ſhoals, to where it interſects the latitude 34 degrees north of the equator; thence a due weſt courſe to the Miſſiſſippi river; thence down the middle of the ſaid river, to the latitude 32, 40;" "thence a due eaſt courſe to the Dunbigby, thence down the middle of the Dunbigby to its junction with the Alabama; thence down the middle of the ſaid river to Mobile Bay; and thence down the Mobile Bay to the place of beginning."</p>
            <p>It was provided that the companies ſhould each make a certain depoſit of money, on account of the purchaſe money of the lands, in the treaſury of the ſtate; and that on their producing receipts from the treaſurer for theſe depoſits, the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or ſhould give them grants, taking at the ſame time mortgages of the lands to ſecure the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining payments, which were to be made on or before the firſt of November following. In caſe of failure in theſe payments, the mortgages were to be inſtantly forecloſed, the firſt payments to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited, and the grants to become void. It was alſo provided "That the lands to be conveyed by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the act ſhould be free from taxation till the inhabitants of them ſhould come to be repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the legiſlature of the ſtate<note n="*" place="bottom">See the act. Appendix No. 11.</note>.</p>
            <p>The depoſits were made accordingly, and the grants paſſed in purſuance of the act. Before the firſt of November, the final payments were completed, and the mortgages taken up. The companies afterwards proceeded to ſell parts of this land to various per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in New-York, Maſſachuſetts, South-Caroli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, and elſewhere, for valuable conſiderations.</p>
            <p>It muſt be remarked that previous to this act, the various companies had made formal propoſals
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035588_0018_1005F764C75551C0"/>to the legiſlature for the purchaſe of the lands; which were accepted and a bill paſſed thro' both houſes accordingly. But the governor, judging theſe terms not ſufficiently advantageous to the ſtate, refuſed his aſſent to the bill, and ſtated his objections at large. Another bill was immediately framed ſo as to obviate the moſt material of theſe objections. It was paſſed, and received his ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note n="*" place="bottom">See appendix No. 2. clauſe of the repealing act, which recites theſe facts.</note>.</p>
            <p>The whole ſum of money paid into the treaſury of Georgia, on account of theſe purchaſes, was five hundred thouſand dollars. Of this ſum one hundred thouſand dollars were appropriated by laws of the ſtate diſtinct from the abovementioned act, and perſuant to thoſe appropriations were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually expended in the courſe of the year 1795<note n="†" place="bottom">See appendix No. 3. Governor Matthews's communication to the legiſlature.</note>.</p>
            <p>On the 13, of February 1796, the repealing act was paſſed. This act however, makes no mention of repealing that of January 7, 1795, but after ſtating various objections againſt it, declares that it was <hi>originally void,</hi> and directs ſuch part of the money paid in under it as then remained in the treaſury, to be re-funded to the purchaſers, provided they ſhould apply for it in the courſe of eight months; otherwiſe to be forfeited to the ſtate, and in the mean time to remain in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury at their riſk and expence. No proviſion is made for the reimburſement of that part which had been expended for the uſe of the ſtate<note n="‡" place="bottom">See appendix No. 14. The repealing act.</note>. In this ſituation the affairs now remains.</p>
            <p>From this view of the ſubject it ſeems ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly clear that no part of this country, above a line drawn due eaſt from the mouth of the Yazoo to the Apalachicola, belonged to the United States,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035588_0019_1005F76750AB97E8"/>at the time of the ſale. This it is believed will appear, in a ſatisfactory manner, from an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive examination of their claim, under all the points of view in which it ſeems capable of being preſented.</p>
            <p>There are but three foundations on which the claims of the United States, in this country can reſt.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place it may be contended, that thoſe clauſes in the proclamation of 1763, by which the ſale and ſettlement of land in the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were reſtricted to the heads of the rivers fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into the Atlantic, from the weſt north-weſt, did in fact curtail the extent of the colonies, and reduce them from the Miſſiſſippi to a line drawn from north-eaſt to ſouth-weſt, thro' the heads of thoſe rivers: and that this line having thus become their weſtern boundary, all the lands beyond it muſt be conſidered as waſte territories of the crown, not ſubject to any colonial juriſdiction; in which caſe they muſt have been veſted in the United States by the ceſſion from Great-Britain in the treaty of peace.</p>
            <p>In order to decide how far this principle is well-founded; it will be proper to advert to the words of the proclamation itſelf; to the manner in which the Britiſh government acted under it before the revolution: and to the conſtruction which it has received from the ſeveral ſtates, and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the United States, ſince they became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant.</p>
            <p>From a careful review of the proclamation it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and a compariſon of the various parts with each other, it ſeems evident that the clauſes in queſtion were intended, not as a reſtriction of the territorial limits of the colonies, but <hi>an inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the governors reſpecting the time, place, and manner, of granting lands and making ſettlements.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:035588_0020_1005F76A8D0CCA30"/>
The proclamation appears to have had five ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in view. 1. To erect certain new govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments compoſed of the territories which Great-Britain had recently acquired by her treaties of peace, with France and Spain. 2. To annex cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain additional territories to ſome of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then exiſting. 3. To reward the land and naval forces of Britain, which had ſerved in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica during the war, by an allotment of land in the colonies. 4. To protect the Indians in the ſafe and quiet poſſeſſion of ſuch lands as it was thought proper to reſerve for their uſe and: 5. To regulate trade between them and the coloniſts. There is no hint of an intention to reſtrict the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the colonies by a line drawn thro' the heads of the rivers, or in any other manner. Had that been the intention of the Britiſh government, it would probably have been expreſsly declared; it having always been its practice to make alterations in the boundaries of its provinces in a very expreſs and ſolemn manner, and uſually in conſequence of repreſentations from the board of trade and plantations. This was the caſe in the extenſion of Georgia to the river St. Mary's, by this very proclamation, and of Weſt Florida, to the mouth of the Yazoo afterwards; both which took place in conſequence of recommendations from the board of trade<note n="*" place="bottom">See Act. gen. report 135, 133. And appendix No. 2. &amp; 3.</note>. It being intended alſo to extend the governments of Novia Scotia, and Newfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, the extenſions were made by this proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the moſt expreſs and formal manner. It does not therefore ſeem in the leaſt degree proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ſo important a meaſure as the cutting off one half of all the colonies, thoſe at leaſt which were royal governments, if intended, ſhould have
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:035588_0021_1005EBE79E18A6A0"/>been left to mere implication; to expreſſions, which even taken ſingly, many bear a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent import.</p>
            <p>The clauſes which contain thoſe expreſſions, are confined to the fourth object of the proclamation, which they appear to have had ſolely in view, viz. "To protect the Indians, in the, ſafe and quiet poſſeſſion of ſuch lands as it was thought proper to reſerve for their uſe." They are introduced by a preamble, which ſtates, "That it was juſt and reaſonable, and eſſential to the intereſts and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Britiſh government and its colonies, that the ſeveral nations or tribes of Indians with whom it was connected, and who lived under its protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould not be diſturbed or moleſted in the poſſeſſion of ſuch parts of its dominions and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, as not having been ceded to, or purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it, were reſerved to them or any of them, <hi>as their hunting grounds."</hi> In order to prevent this diſturbance and moleſtation, various meaſures, are adopted. Firſt the governors of Quebec, Eaſt Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, and Weſt Florida, the three new governments, are forbidden to grant any warrants of ſurvey, or patents for lands, beyond the bounds of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective governments." Secondly the governors of the other colonies are forbidden, <hi>"For the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> and <hi>until the further pleaſure</hi> of <hi>the crown ſhould be known,</hi> to grant warrants of ſurvey or paſs pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents for any lands <hi>beyond the heads or ſources</hi> of <hi>any</hi> of <hi>the rivers, which fall into the Atlantic ocean, from the weſt, or north-weſt;</hi> or upon any lands, which not having been ceded to, or purchaſed by the crown, were reſerved to the Indians or any of them." Thirdly all the lands not included within the limits of the three new governments, or of the Hadſons Bay Company; and "all the lands and territories lying to the weſtward of the ſources of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035588_0022_1005F76E653AC300"/>the rivers, which fall into the ſea from the weſt and north-weſt," were declared to be reſerved, <hi>for the preſent,</hi> under the ſovereignty, protection, and dominion of the crown, for the uſe of the Indians. And all perſons were forbidden from making any purchaſes or ſettlements, or taking poſſeſſion of any lands within thoſe reſervations. Fourthly, all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who, either wilfully or inadvertently, had ſeated themſelves upon any of the land ſo reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or upon any other land which, not having been ceded to or purchaſed by the crown, were ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for the Indians, were ordered immediately to remove. And fifthly, it was provided that in future "no private perſon ſhould preſume to make any purchaſe from the Indians of any lands reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them <hi>within thoſe parts of the colonies where the crown had allowed ſettlement,</hi> but that if the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhould at any time be inclined to ſell ſuch lands they ſhould be purchaſed only for the crown and in its name, at ſome public meeting of the Indians held for that purpoſe, by the governor of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony reſpectively within which they lay. And in caſe they ſhould lie within the limits of any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietaries, then conformable to ſuch inſtructions as the crown or the proprietaries ſhould give."</p>
            <p>On theſe regulations it is obſervable, in the firſt place, that they are all parts of a ſyſtem the avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed object and ſcope of which was to protect the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, not to alter or abridge the limits of colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. To this object all of them were important; nor was that which reſpected the lands weſt of the heads of the rivers leſs ſo than any of the others. As thoſe lands lay at a great diſtance from the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled parts of the colonies, they were beyond the reach of protection from the colonial governments; and it was therefore important that they ſhould, while reſerved for the Indians, be taken under the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035588_0023_1005F771F2546E10"/>immediate protection of the crown, which poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a military force upon the frontiers could more readily and effectually repel thoſe inroads and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments which it was the object of this ſyſtem to prevent. The lands below the ſources of the rivers on the contrary, being nearer to the ſeats of the colonial governments, might derive the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry protection from that ſource.</p>
            <p>As to the terms "ſovereignty and dominion of the crown" which are applied to the lands above the heads of the rivers, they mean nothing; for all parts of the colonies were equally under the ſov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty and dominion of the crown, the proprieta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry governments excepted. Even they were ſo to many intents, and where they were exempted from ſovereignty by their charters, it was not in the power of the crown to bring them under it again by a proclamation.</p>
            <p>It is to be remarked, in the ſecond place, that this "ſovereignty, protection, and dominion" were only to be "for the preſent" and while the lands were "reſerved for the uſe of the Indians." It was therefore a temporary regulation; not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent change in the limits of a province, and was to ceaſe as ſoon as the Indians ſhould think fit to relinquiſh the lands, and the crown to permit the ſettlement of them. They were then to be under the government of that colony within whoſe limits they lay; to form part of it as before.</p>
            <p>The ſame remark is applicable to the prohibition againſt granting warrants or patents for lands a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the heads of the rivers. It was only for the preſent" that they were prohibited: which ſhows that the prohibition was a temporary regulation on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the lands ſtill continuing a part of the colonies reſpectively to which they belonged before, and the governors of which, when the prohibition ſhould
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035588_0024_1005F77384045DB8"/>be removed, would go on to grant the lands as formerly.</p>
            <p>It is remarkable in the third place, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation ſpeaks of "lands reſerved for the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans within thoſe parts of the colonies where the crown had thought proper to allow ſettlement" and thoſe lands whenever the Indians ſhould be diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſell them, were to be purchaſed by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors in the name of the crown and for its uſe. Settlements were therefore permitted in parts of the colonies where the lands had been reſerved for the Indians! This could apply only to lands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the heads of the rivers which had not been purchaſed or ceded; for above the heads of the rivers ſettlement was abſolutely prohibited; and it proves that "to reſerve lands far the Indians," did not take them out of the limits of the colony. There were alſo <hi>parts of the colonies</hi> where ſettlement was forbidden. This could apply only to the lands above the heads of the rivers; for below them, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement was permitted, provided the land was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly purchaſed from the Indians. Conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the lands above the heads of the rivers, though reſerved for the Indians under the ſpecial protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the crown, and forbidden to be ſettled without its expreſs licenſe, were nevertheleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as "parts of the colonies," within whoſe former limits they lay.</p>
            <p>The difference made by the proclamation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the lands above, and thoſe below the heads of the rivers, ſeems to be this, that both continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be part of the colonies, the latter might be ſettled whenever they could be purchaſed from the Indians conformably the eſtabliſhed regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: whereas the former, however willing the Indians might be, could not be ſettled or purchaſed without the expreſs permiſſion of the crown: the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035588_0025_1005F776E7ECBBD0"/>reaſons of which diſtinction have been hinted at above, and indeed are ſufficiently obvious.</p>
            <p>It is to be obſerved in the laſt place, that theſe proviſions extend to all the colonies, both royal and proprietary: ſome of which laſt deſcription, particularly Pennſylvania, poſſeſſed extenſive terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories beyond the heads of the rivers, which fall into the Atlantic from the weſt and north-weſt. Although the crown might, and frequently did, execute a general ſuperintending power over the proprietary governments, as well as its other colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies might regulate their trade, protect the Indians, and preſcribe the manner in which lands ſhould be purchaſed or ſettled; it certainly neither had, or, claimed a right to alter, much leſs curtail their limits. This is evident from the whole tenor of its conduct, reſpecting the colonies, as well as from the nature of the proprietary charters them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; which being in the nature of grants inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the proprietors with the right of ſoil. This right the crown could no more take from them then it could deprive indiviuals of any other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty which they poſſeſſed and accordingly we have ſeen that it never meddled with the Virginia ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory until the company's charter had been legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vacated by a quo warranto. Nor was it till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the council of Plymouth<note n="*" place="bottom">See Hazard's col. vol. i. p. 390. alſo act p. 11, 12, 13.</note>, the lords proprietors of Carolina, and the truſtees of Georgia, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively ſurrendered their charters, that the crown proceeded to make any diſpoſition of their territories. It can hardly be preſumed that it would ſo ſuddenly have departed from its conſtant maxims of conduct, and from the known princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of its laws, as to attempt regulations by which the proprietary government of Pennſylvania would have been deprived at once of nearly half its ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035588_0026_1005F7796350C580"/>Yet this muſt have been the effect of the clauſes in queſtion had they been conſidered as a reſtriction of limits, rather than temporary inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the governors.</p>
            <p>It is moreover an invarible rule in the expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of legal acts, that in caſe of ambiguity any conſtruction by which they can be rendered conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with right is to be preferred. But to conſider theſe clauſes as a reſtriction of boundary, would render them directly repugnant to the plain and acknowledged rights of the proprietary govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Whereas to regard them merely as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to the governors reſpecting the time and manner of making ſettlements, will reconcile them equally to the rights of the proprietors and of the crown: and this is the intention with which the proclamation, conſidered in itſelf, and taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all theſe points of view, appears to have been made</p>
            <p>The conſtruction thus obviouſly deducible from the words and tenor of the inſtrument itſelf, is ſtrongly ſupported by the conduct of the Britiſh government, before the revolution. It muſt here be repeated and conſtantly keep in view, that theſe proviſions extended, not only to South-Carolina, and Georgia, but to all the colonies whoſe terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories lay above and below the heads of the rivers, falling in the Atlantic from the weſt and north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt of this number, were New-York, Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, Virginia, and North-Carolina; beſides South-Carolina, and Georgia. It is perfectly well known that between the proclamation of 1763, and the revolution, at a time when the Britiſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſtill ſubſiſted in Virginia, ſhe extended her ſettlements beyond the heads of the rivers, falling into the Atlantic. Many of the ſettlements or Polſton, New River, Greenbriar, and other waters falling into the Ohio, were of this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:035588_0027_1005F77AF28FA250"/>and they were made not only with the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, but under the authority, of the Britiſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. It is not known at what time the grants of land were made under which theſe ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements took place but it is perfectly certain that the ſettlements themſelves were always conſidered, as well after the proclamation as before, as being part of Virginia and that the laws were adminiſtered in them, under the authority, and in the name of its colonial government. This, it is moſt evident, could not have been the caſe, had the proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of 1763, been conſidered as curtailing the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, and reſtricting them to a line drawn thro' the heads of the rivers. In that caſe theſe ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo far from going on and increaſing under the government of Virginia, muſt have been cut off from the colony; and the exerciſe of authority there by its governor, would have been regarded as an act of uſurpation. But his we know was not the caſe. If Virginia was not curtailed neither were the other colonies; for the clauſes in queſtion apply equally to them all. From whence it is moſt evident that the crown conſidered, and intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe clauſes as no more then a temporary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction to its governors about the time and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of making ſettlements; the extent and boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries of the colonies, when it ſhould permit ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements, remaining ſtill the ſame.</p>
            <p>It is equally clear that the ſubject has always been viewed in the ſame light by the ſtates them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſince the revolution, and by the government of the United States. Not to ſpeak of Georgia, which, as we have already ſeen, paſſed an act in 1783, to declare and eſtabliſh her territorial li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, it is well known, that South-Carolina grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed large grantees of land thro' all the country from the mountains to the Miſſiſſippi, which grants ſhe afterwards vacated, not becauſe ſhe had
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:035588_0028_1005F77E93D502D8"/>no right to make them, but becauſe the land had not been purchaſed from the Indians. She after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ceded her claim to the United States. North-Carolina too opened a land-office in 1784, and granted ſeveral millions of acres between the Miſſiſſippi, and the heads of the rivers which fall into the Atlantic. She afterwards ceded the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the United States, ſubject to theſe grants; and ſubject to them it was accepted; nor was the validity of the grants, except ſo far as related to the poſſeſſory right of the Indians, ever been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted. Indeed the whole ſtate of Teneſſee is held by this very tenure. Before the ceſſion this county was conſidered as part of North-Carolina, as ſuch was governed, and as ſuch had a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative in the Congreſs of the United States. In the ſame manner, Virginia ſold the whole Kentucky country, and then erected it into a ſtate; it having remained in the mean time, under her laws, and a part of her ſtate for many years; many and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive diſtricts, which ſtill conſtitute parts of Virginia, and as ſuch ſend members to Congreſs, lie beyond the heads of the rivers which fall into the Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic. All theſe ſettlements, grants, and ceſſions, have proceeded upon the principle that the weſtern limits of the colonies were not altered by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of 1763. Otherwiſe all the grants of North-Carolina in Teneſſee, and of Virginia in Kentucky, would be illegal; and a very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of the territory ſtill claimed and poſſeſſed by the latter ſtate, muſt be lopt off from her.</p>
            <p>Until therefore it ſhall be ſhewn that the clauſes in queſtion apply excluſively to South-Carolina, and Georgia, or that the ſame rules of conſtruction which have been univerſally adopted and admitted, with reſpect to the other ſtates, ought not to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to them likewiſe, it ſeems perfectly clear that
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:035588_0029_1005F78101190568"/>whether we regard the proclamation of 1763, itſelf the acts of the Britiſh governments under it, or the conſtruction which has been given to it by own governments ſince the revolution, it cannot be conſidered as having curtailed the weſtern boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary of thoſe ſtates.</p>
            <p>From whence it reſults that the United Stares, can found no claim to the lands in queſtion, on this proclamation.</p>
            <p>Their claim however, to theſe lands, or a part of them, is ſupported on another principle which muſt be next examined. It is ſaid that altho' Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina, originally extended as far ſouth as Florida, yet when the proprietors ſurrendered their charter, and theſe territories became re-veſted in the crown, the ſouthern limits of that province were reſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the eſtabliſhment of Georgia: that the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Savannah, and Alatamaha, having been fit as the limits of Georgia, all the lands ſouth o ſt were cut off from the government of South-Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, and continued to be waſte territories of the crown, till part of them were annext to Georgia by the proclamation of ſixty three: that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation however, extending only to the lands, "between the Alatamaha, and the St. Mary's," could not include the territory which lay above the heads of thoſe rivers; and that this territory there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore continued to be waſte land, not annext to any government, nor part of any colony, till the treaty of peace, by which it was veſted in the United ſtates By this pretenſion, if eſtabliſhed, they would gain all the country, bounded by the Floridas, the Miſſiſſippi, and a line drawn from the head of the St. Mary's, to that of the Alatamaha, and from thence due weſt to the Miſſiſſippi.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be more uncertain than the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of this laſt line. If the poſition of the ſources,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:035588_0030_1005F7828F97CE58"/>of the Alatamaha were known, which is very far from being the caſe, it would ſtill be very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to aſcertain what ought to be conſidered as the head of the river: whether the place where it takes the name of the Alatamaha, its nigheſt ſource from the ſea, or its moſt ſouthern ſource, be intended by the charter as the place from where the weſt line is to be drawn. It has been thought that the moſt Southern ſource is meant; but this is far from being fully juſtified by the words of the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which evidently refer to the moſt ſouthern <hi>mouth</hi> of the river; it being known to enter the ſea by ſeveral channels. The words are, "From the moſt northern ſtream, of a river, there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly called the Savannah, all along the ſea coaſt, to the ſouthward, to the moſt ſouthern ſtream of a certain other great water or river, called the Alatamaha, and weſtward, from the heads of of the ſaid rivers reſpectively to the South-Sea." It: ſeems probable however, that the <hi>higheſt ſource from the ſea,</hi> was the point from whence the weſt line was intended to be drawn: and tho' this ſource will remain for a long time uncertain, even ſhould the claim be eſtabliſhed, yet it may be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed not to lie ſo far north, as to affect the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of the upper Miſſiſſippi company, whoſe moſt ſouthern extent is no more than twenty-five miles ſouth of the north boundary of Georgia.</p>
            <p>The claim however, could certainly include a great, perhaps far the greater part of the Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia company's purchaſe.</p>
            <p>This claim reſts on two queſtions. 1. Whether the lands ſouth of Georgia, continued to be a part of South-Carolina, after the former colony was erected? 2. Whether the whole of them were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>next to Georgia, by the proclamation of 1763, or that part only which lay below the heads of the Alatamaha, and St. Mary's. If they continued to
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:035588_0031_1005F7851F086988"/>be part of South-Carolina, the ceſſion of that ſtate, by the convention of Beaufort, veſted in Georgia ſuch parts of them as were not affected by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of 1763. If they were all affected by that proclamation, then the right of Georgia was complete independantly of the ceſſion from South-Carolina.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt point, it is to be regretted that more ſatisfactory documents for the inveſtigation of it, cannot be reſorted to. The papers moſt likely to decide it with abſolute certainty, are the commiſſions and inſtructions, given to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of South-Carolina, between the years 1732, when the colony of Georgia, was erected and 1763, the date of the proclamation. Thoſe docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments no doubt exiſt in the office of trade, and plantations in London. An official enquiry was made from a gentleman having acceſs to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of that office, and he furniſhed ſome extracts and copies; but others of a very important nature were omitted. From ſuch documents however, as can be recurred to the following points ſeem to be ſatisfactorily eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>Firſt that after the ſurrender of their charter by the Lords Proprietors, the juriſdiction of the Royal governors of South Carolina extended over the whole country which had been included in that charter</p>
            <p>It appears by a repreſentation from the board of trade and plantations to the king, on the 1ſt of December 1727 that a fort was at that time kept up on the Alatamaha river under the government of South Carolina, and had been for ſome years; and the continuation of it under the ſame authority is adviſed<note n="*" place="bottom">Att. gen. rep ort, 30.</note>. And on the 10th of June, 1730; the governor of South Carolina was inſtructed to lay out Townſhips and grant lands on the Alata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meha<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. 70.</note>.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:035588_0032_1005F7879A2E6480"/>
Secondly that when the Colony of Georgia was erected the country of which it was compoſed was conſidered by the Britiſh government as part of South-Carolina.</p>
            <p>Lord Percival, Oglethorpe and others who firſt projected the Georgia ſcheme, petitioned the crown for a grant of land <hi>in South-Carolina,</hi> for that purpoſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Att. gen. rep. 84.</note>. In the reports of the board of trade on this petition, Georgia is called "the colony to be eſtabliſhed; in South-Carolina<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. 87</note>." After the eſtabliſhment of the colony the command of its militia was to <hi>remain</hi> with the governor of South-Carolina.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. 912</note>Even in the charter, the lands to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded are deſcribed as "lying and being in that part of South-Carolina in America which lies &amp;c."<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. 91.</note>. Lord Granville's part of South-Carolina not having, at that time, been ſeparately allotted to him, his right in this country as one of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors, was admitted ſtill to exiſt; and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the charter granted only ſeven eighths of the land to the truſtees<note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid. 100.</note>, to whom Lord Grenville afterwards conveyed his eighth. And in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to the Governor of South-Carolina, of a date ſubſequent to the charter, Georgia is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as "a Colony ſettled within the bounds of the province of South-Carolina" and the governor of that province is inſtructed to regiſter the charter among its records<note n="**" place="bottom">Ibid. 95.</note>.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, that after the eſtabliſhment of Georgia the lands ſouth of its ſouthern boundary ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, and were conſidered by the crown as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, under the juriſdiction of South-Carolina, and of conſequence a part of that province.</p>
            <p>It apperas by a repreſentation from the governor of Georgia, dated October 17th 1761, that there
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035588_0033_1005F78AF6BC92C0"/>was then, and long had been a military poſt kept up on Cumberland Iſland, far ſouth of the Alata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maha, "under the direction and authority of the governor of South-Carolina<note n="*" place="bottom">Att. gen Rep. 111.</note>". The governor of South-Carolina too, in a letter to the board of trade dated Auguſt 17th 1763, affirms that there was then, and had been for many years, a poſt to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Alatamaha garriſoned by detachments from that province<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. 118.</note>. But this point is more ſtrongly confirmed by the proceedings which took place with reſpect to certain lands lying ſouth of the Alatamaha and granted by the governor of South-Carolina in the year 1762. Theſe grants being complained of by the governor of Gorgia, the board of trade and plantations reproved the governor of South-Carolina for making them; not on the ground of his poſſeſſing no juriſdiction, but becauſe "the making of grants for lands in that country was contrary to the intentions of the crown, and might not only embarraſs the execution of thoſe arrangements which would probably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come neceſſary from the ceſſion of Florida, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere alſo with the meaſures about to be taken for the extenſion of Gorgia<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. 115.</note>. The governor juſtified his conduct by alledging that his province ſtill extended as far ſouth as the limits fixt by the charter of Carolina to the lords proprietors, except as to ſuchland as had been expreſsly included with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the charter of Georgia<note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. 117.</note>. In a ſubſequént re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation from the board of trade to the crown they ſeem to admit that theſe grants were made "conformably to the governors inſtructions<note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid. 144.</note>." And they expreſsly recommend that an act of the Georgia legiſlature, paſſed after that province had been extended to the St. Marys and tending to
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:035588_0034_1005F78D9EECB7B0"/>ſubject the grantees of thoſe lands to improper conditions, ſhould not receive the royal aſſent<note n="*" place="bottom">Att. gen. Rep. 141</note>. Tranſcripts of thoſe grants were afterwards ordered by the crown to be regiſtered in Georgia<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. 144.</note>. And the grants themſelves thus virtually confirmed, have ever ſince been, and ſtill are, conſidered as valid.</p>
            <p>All theſe proceedings muſt have been founded on the principle that the lands ſouth of the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern boundary of Georgia, as firſt eſtabliſhed by its charter, continued to be a part of South-Carolina till the proclamation of 1763, annext them or part of them at leaſt, to the former province.</p>
            <p>How indeed could they ceaſe to be ſo? nothing is more clear then that all this country was includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the province of South-Carolina at and before the eſtabliſhment of Georgia. This has been abundantly proved<note n="‡" place="bottom">Sapaa. p. 55, 56 57,</note>. But the charter of Georgia could affect thoſe lands only which were included within its limits; nor was that province ever underſtood, either by its own governors or the crown, to extend further<note n="‖" place="bottom">See Att. gen. rep. 111, 105.115.135.140.</note>. All the reſt of the country, of courſe, remained as it was before, until a further deſpoſition of it was made by ſome new act of the crown. It is not pretended that any ſuch acts took place till the proclamation of 1763<note n="§" place="bottom">Ibid. 18 117.</note>. The circumſtance of this country being ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the reſt of Carolina by the intervening province of Georgia does not alter the caſe: for it is by no means neceſſary, nor does it always happen, that all the territories of a government ſhould lie adjoining. The province of Maine we know, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the royal government was, and at this day continues to be, a part of Maſſachuſſetts, tho' New-Hampſhire lies between them; and Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:035588_0035_1005F78F4F6B4BD0"/>by virtue of her charter, which extended weſt to the Miſſiſſippi, claims and actually holds, lands on lake Erie, notwithſtanding that New-York, New-Jerſey, and Pennſylvania intervene.</p>
            <p>There are however two paſſages which might ſeem at firſt view to contradict this opinion; but it is believed that on examination they will apppear in a different light.</p>
            <p>In a report to the crown by the board of trade and plantations, on which the proclamation of 1763 was founded, it is ſtated "that a large tract of land lying between the North boundary of Eaſt Florida and the river Alatamaha, <hi>which had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herto been unoccupied as to any permament ſettlement,</hi> remained to be put under ſome proper eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note n="*" place="bottom">Att. gen. rep. 135.</note>".</p>
            <p>On this paſſage it is to be obſerved that <hi>occupation</hi> and <hi>right</hi> are diſtinct things; ſo that the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this country's not having been occupied by South-Carolina, would by no means prove that it was not under the juriſdiction, did not from part, of that province. It is not ſaid, moreover, that this country had not been occupied at all; that would have been contrary to the fact; for as we have ſeen, a poſt had been kept up in it and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſoned from South-Carolina; but that it had not been occupied <hi>as to permament ſettlement.</hi> But it is a well known principle of law that a legal poſſeſſion where neceſſary, may be maintained without a permanent ſettlement. Had actual poſſeſſion in this caſe been neceſſary, which may well be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the continued occupation by a military poſt would have been ſufficient.</p>
            <p>The board of trade is ſaid to have laid the above-mentioned grants before the crown lawyers, for an opinion on their validity, and to have alledged at the ſame time "that the province of South-Carolina
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:035588_0036_1005F792A8591A00"/>did not appear, at any time, either when under the government of the proprietors, or ſince it had been in the hands of the crown, to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed any juriſdiction in the country ſouth of the Alatamaha, or taken any poſſeſſion of it."<note n="*" place="bottom">Att. gen. rep. 20.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is to be remarked in the firſt place, that the crown lawyers did not give an opinion, at leaſt not an unfavourable one, on the ſubject of theſe grants: from whence it may be inferred that after an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of the ſubject, they did not concur in the objections of the board. Secondly, that the aſſertion of the board, even if true, amounts to nothing; the right to poſſeſs, and the exerciſe of that right, being things altogether diſtinct. And thirdly, that the aſſertion is not true; it being evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the documents already adduced that the province of South-Carolina had always maintained poſſeſſion of that country, at leaſt till the year 1762, by a military poſt.</p>
            <p>It ſeems therefore clearly to reſult from all theſe conſiderations that the country ſouth of the Alata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maha not only was a part of South-Carolina pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly to the eſtabliſhment of Georgia, but conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to be ſo afterwards until the proclamation of 1763. The facts ſtated indeed relate wholly to the country near the ſea coaſt, becauſe that alone hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been ſettled by the Engliſh or even known to them, the interior parts were never expreſsly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated by the acts of their government. But the principles on which thoſe acts were founded apply equally to every part of the territory ſouth of the ancient ſouthern boundary of Georgia. South-Carolina could claim near the coaſt in virtue only of her charter, and that charter gave an equal claim to all the land contained within its limits and not included in thoſe of Georgia. The right therefore which they poſſeſſed on the ſhores of the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:035588_0037_1005F79505725920"/>Atlantic before the year 1763, extended equally to the banks of the Miſſiſſippi, and by her ceſſion at Beaufort in 1788, was completely veſted in the ſtate of Georgia.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond point, whether the proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of 1763, annexed to Georgia all the land ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between her ancient ſouthern boundary and the northern limits of the Floridas, or ſuch part only as actually lay between the Alatamaha and St. Mary's below their ſources? the diciſion of it, if now neceſſary, might be attended with ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty. The words of the proclamation are "We have alſo, with the advice of our privy council aforeſaid, annexed to our province of Georgia, all the lands lying between the rivers Alatamaha and St. Mary's<note n="*" place="bottom">Att. gen rep. 38.</note>." Nothing elſe is ſaid on the ſubject. From theſe expreſſions, and ſome others uſed by the board of trade and plantations in different com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. 135.140.</note>to the crown on this matter, it would ſeem that thoſe lands only which lay below the heads of the rivers were contemplated. But this point ſeems to have been decided, as far as relates to the United States, by the government itſelf. In a report from the Secretary of State, intended as the baſis of inſtructions to our commiſſioners for treating with Spain, the latitude 31, is inſiſted on as the ſouthern boundary of Georgia "eſtabliſhed between that province and Florida by the procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of 1763<note n="‡" place="bottom">Appendix, No. 9. An extract from the repreſentation.</note>." And in the repreſentation made by our commiſſioners December 17th 1793, the ſame thing is repeated, and urged to the court of Spain as the foundation of our right.<note n="‖" place="bottom">The ſame principle is repeated, and urged on the court of Spain, by Mr Pinckney, the American miniſter for negociating the laſt treaty with that power, ſo lately as Auguſt 10th, 1795, ſeveral months after the ſales in queſtion had been formally notifie to the government.

               </note> It might
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035588_0038_1005F79694080D40"/>perhaps be thought doubtful how far theſe decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would preclude the government in a court of law; but we can hardly ſuppoſe that it would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend for a principle formally and expreſsly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by its own ſolemn acts; which it muſt do were it to urge a claim againſt the ſtate of Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia for any of theſe lands, founded on a ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the whole of them, down to the Miſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippi and the latitude 31, were not annexed to that ſtate by the proclamation in queſtion.</p>
            <p>The third and only remaining ground on which the United States can reſt their claim to a part of this territory, is the extenſion of Weſt Florida after the year 1763.</p>
            <p>It is contended that the Britiſh crown having previouſly to the year 1770, and while all the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies were ſubject to its dominion, extended Weſt Florida up to the mouth of the Yazoo and a line drawn due left from thence to the Apilachi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cola, by inſtructions and commiſſions to its go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors, all the county between that line and the latitude 31, ceaſing to belong either to South-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina or Georgia, became a part of Weſt Florida, and being thus placed without the juriſdiction of any ſtate in the Union, was ceded, by the treaty of peace, to the United States.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be more certain than the principle that all the lands ceded by Great Britain in the treaty of peace, and not included within the limits of any ſtate, became veſted in the United States. Nor can there be any doubt that as both Carolina and Georgia were royal governments in the year 1770, the crown had a right at that time to alter, abridge, or extend their limits at its pleaſure; to take parts of their territories and annex them to old governments or erect them into new ones. It was by the exerciſe of this right that after Virginia became a royal government in 1624,<note n="*" place="bottom">Supra, p. 9, 10.</note> part of its
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035588_0039_1005F79944E0B3F8"/>territory, all ſouth of the latitude 36, 30, was included in the grant of Carolina: that after the ſurrender by the lords proprietors, Carolina itſelf was divided into two governments, and Georgia carved out of one of them; and that the country ſouth of the firſt boundary eſtabliſhed for Georgia was afterwards annexed to that province.</p>
            <p>As to the mode of exerciſing this right there may be more room for doubt. It may be ſaid that when the limits of a province had been fixed by a procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation or charter, which are public and ſolemn acts, they ought not to be altered, and could not legally, by acts of <hi>a leſs ſolemn</hi> nature; ſuch as commiſſions or inſtructions. But this objection does not ſeem to have any weight; becauſe tho' commiſſions and inſtructions, eſpecially the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, were not publiſhed in the ſame manner with proclamations, they were nevertheleſs publiſhed, and with circumſtances of ſufficient notority; being entered of record not only in the office of trade and plantations, but alſo in the provinces; where they were moreover publicly read. They received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a greater degree of publicity than charters, which were recorded only, without being promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in any manner. As to authenticity, theſe commiſſions were acts of the king in council, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the great ſeal, as well as proclamations or let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters patent, and therefore of equal authority. As the crown, beſides, poſſeſſed the right of altering boundaries it might certainly exerciſe that right in whatever manner it thought fit: and indeed the extent of the royal colonies depended, in many inſtances, on the commiſſions to governors, and was regulated by them. Of this Virginia, Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina, and Georgia, are examples; which after they became royal governments, were continued according to their ancient limits, not by new let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:035588_0040_1005F79C977E1960"/>patent, but merely by the commiſſions to their reſpective governors.</p>
            <p>It therefore ſeems undeniable, that by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion of Florida, the territory which it affected was entirely cut off from Georgia, or South-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina, to which ever of them it belonged, and rendered completely a part of Florida; from which it neceſſarily follows that this territory was ceded by the treaty of peace to the United States, not to Georgia, and veſted in them.</p>
            <p>As the mouth of the Yazoo, however, lies in latitude 32, 30<note n="*" place="bottom">See the appendix, No. 6.—an extract from the repreſentation of Purcell, who ſurveyed that country, under the authority of the Britiſh government.</note>, or thereabout, it is clear that this claim of the United States does not affect the upper Miſſiſſippi commpany's purchaſe, which cannot extend further ſouth than latitude 34, "30". But a very conſiderable part of the Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia company's purchaſe, will lie below a line to be drawn due eaſt from the mouth of the Yazoo. Its ſouthern boundary between the Miſſiſſippi and Donbigby, is higher up than that line; namely in latitude 32, 40, but between the Donbigby and Alabama, it extends down nearly to latitude 31. In this quarter conſequently, a great part of its lands are included in the claim of the United States.</p>
            <p>How far is this claim ſtill valid againſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany? Admitting that theſe lands belonged to the United States at the time of the ſale, was it attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or preceded by any conduct on their part which will render it valid againſt them, in the eye of the law? This was the ſecond point propoſed for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination.</p>
            <p>On this point two queſtions ariſe which ought to be diſtinctly conſidered: firſt whether the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the United States reſpecting this territory at the ſale, and previous to it, was ſuch as, if
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035588_0041_1005F79F288B7888"/>perſued by an individual under ſimilar circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, would have rendered the ſale binding on him? and ſecondly whether the ſame principles will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the government?</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, there is no rule better eſtabliſhed in the courts of equity than this, that whoever, knowingly and without conſtraint, acquieſces in a diſpoſition of his property, for a valuable conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, by a perſon who pretended and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have the right, ſhall be bound by the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: it being a maxim of law, "That ſilence im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies content; and that he who does'not forbid an act when he has a right, and an opportunity to do ſo, orders it<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Equi. ca. abr. 357.—caſe of Hanning, v. Ferrets.</note>." This rule rule has been long ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the courts of equity, and is abundantly ſupported by the authorities cited at the bottom<note n="†" place="bottom">Hudſden, v. Cheney, 2. Vern. 150.—Raw, v. Pole, 2 Vern. 239.—Ibbotſon, v. Rhodes, 2. Vern. 554.—Berrisford, v. Milward.—Barpard, Chan. 101, 102.—Peter, v. Ruſſel, 2. Vern. 726.—Hobbs, v.

            <p>But he muſt acquieſe "knowingly," that is he muſt underſtand the nature of the act about to be done: for he is bound on the principle of having aſſented; and a perſon cannot aſſent to what he did not know. He muſt alſo acquieſe, "without conſtraint," for there can be no aſſent where there is not freedom.</p>
            <p>And the perſon who makes the diſpoſition, muſt not only claim a right, but appear to poſſeſs it; for whoever ſhould make a purchaſe from one who neither claimed, nor appeared to poſſeſs, a right to ſell, could blame none but himſelf, and muſt ſuſtain the loſs as a puniſhment for his own folly.</p>
            <p>But if the owner ſhould not only acquieſe in the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:035588_0042_1005F7A0B536ECC0"/>ſale, but give colour by his conduct to the right of the ſeller, and in that or any other manner encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the purchaſor to buy, he will by ſtronger reaſon, be bound to confirm the ſale<note n="*" place="bottom">See the caſes cited above.</note>. This principle alſo is fully eſtabliſhed by the authorities already cited.</p>
            <p>Let theſe rules be applied to the acts of the ſtate of Georgia and the conduct of the United States reſpecting this territory, previouſly to the ſale in queſtion. It will appear that the latter not only acquieſed, but encouraged: that they not only ſaw in ſilence all the acts of ownerſhip exerciſed by Georgia over this land, all her acts preparatory to the ſale, and the ſale itſelf, but by their own proceedings gave colour and ſanction to her ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
            <p>As early as the year 1783, Georgia began to aſſert her claim to theſe lands. In that year ſhe paſſed an act declaring them to lie within her char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-limits, and holding out encouragement to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to ſettle on them<note n="†" place="bottom">See the act, p. 19.</note>. To this proceeding the United States made no objection.</p>
            <p>In 1795, knowing that the Indian claims had been extinguiſhed in a tract of land on the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſſippi, below the mouth of the Yazoo, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving that extinguiſhment, as it was within the limits ſhe claimed, to have enured to her benefit, ſhe erected that tract into a county, and offered new encouragement to ſettlers. She moreover, at the ſame time, declared her intention of open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a land office for the ſale of the lands<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid p. 19, 20.</note>. To this proceeding the United States made no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
            <p>Sometime afterwards a diſpute aroſe between the two ſtates, South-Carolina, and Georgia, about
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035588_0043_1005F7A349BB8FD8"/>this territory, and it was referred to congreſs; which thus received expreſs notice of the claims of thoſe ſtates, but made no objection to them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged no right in itſelf. This diſpute was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſettled, and South-Carolina ceded her claims to Georgia. The act of ceſſion was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to congreſs; and congreſs made no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection<note n="*" place="bottom">See act p. 23.</note>; ſo far indeed was ſhe from objecting that on the 20th of October, 1787, after this ceſſion had been communicated to her, ſhe made a public, and formal requiſition, on the ſtate of Georgia; for a ceſſion of her territory<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid, p. 24.—See alſo the Preſident's proclamation againſt James, v. Fallon, in 1790.</note>. This act, done under a complete knowledge of all the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, was a very ſtrong recognition of the right of that ſtate.</p>
            <p>In 1789, Georgia, paſſed an act for the ſale of theſe lands to certain companies; one of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies attempted a ſettlement and ſent an agent; all this was known to the government of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States, which iſſued a proclamation againſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain acts of the agent, but ſaid not a word againſt the ſale, or about any right of the United States, to the land<note n="‡" place="bottom">See Jour. of Congreſs, vol, 12. p. 21. —And appendix No. 15. the reſolution itſelf.</note>.</p>
            <p>Two years after this the government of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States, being engaged in a diſpute with Spain about this country, expreſsly declared, in an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial repreſentation, that it belonged to Georgia by virtue of her charters, and the proclamation of 1763, and reſted their claim to it as part of their territories, intirely on her title.</p>
            <p>What higher ſanction to a title could an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, or a government hold out? What ſtronger acknowledgment than this long acquieſcence, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by this expreſs declaration, when the ſubject
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035588_0044_1005F7A69ADC8A88"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">

               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:035588_0045_1005F7A90142A1C0"/>had been ſo often diſcuſſed, the claim ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed? The government not only ſuffer Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia repeatedly to ſay, "This is my land," with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out contradicting her; to ſell it once without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing; but, not content with this tacit acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence, joins in the aſſertion, and lays in a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn act, "This is the land of Georgia." The queſtion may be repeated, what ſtronger encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement can be given to purchaſers?</p>
            <p>Even after the laſt ſale had been made, of which the government was formally notified by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of Georgia, no ſufficient ſteps were taken to warn the purchaſers of their danger, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent them from completing the payment. When the government received this notice only, fifty thouſand dollars out of five hundred thouſand had been paid. The reſt was not due till ſome months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Even then the government ſet up no claim, made no interference. It merely held up the idea that it might poſſibly poſſeſs a right, by directing its law officers to inſtitute an enquiry into the title of Georgia. Even this idea they did not plainly intimate, much leſs expreſsly declare. Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution directs the Attorney general, "To col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, digeſt, and report, <hi>to the next congreſs,</hi> the charters treaties, and other documents, relative to, and explanatory, of the title to the lands ſituate in the ſouthweſtern parts of the United States, and claimed by certain companies under a law of the ſtate of Georgia." How was it to be underſtood from this proceeding that the government claimed the land! with what juſtice could purchaſers, who contracted under the ſtrong previous aſſurances, which have been ſtated and after this laſt tranſaction paid their money, be called upon for the purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed property, by that very party which had thus led them into the contract?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:035588_0046_1005F7AA927BEF00"/>
But was the government apprized of their right? Was it unknown to the purchaſers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? Theſe two queſtions deſerve to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, it is to be obſerved that every perſon is preſumed in law to be acquainted with his own rights. This principle is founded on the beſt reaſons. If a perſon, having a right to land, ſhould ſtand ſilently by, and ſee it ſold, and then be permited to reclaim it under pretence, that he was ignorant of his title, a pretence which it would frequently be impoſſible to diſprove, the greateſt frauds might be committed. It would therefore be preſumed by the courts that he knew his own title, unleſs he gave very good proof to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and he would be bound by the ſale. Moſt of the deciſions indeed have been in caſes where the party was expreſsly ſtated to have been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his own title; but there are ſome where this does not appear; and in one<note n="*" place="bottom">See Hudſden, v. Cheney, 2. Vern. 150.</note>, the owner, who was a woman, declared on oath that ſhe was ignorant of her right: yet as ſhe was preſent at the ſale, and did not object, ſhe was decreed to be bound. This muſt have been on the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple that every one is preſumed to underſtand his own rights.</p>
            <p>This principle however, could apply only in caſes where the party had a reaſonable opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of knowing them; for if he were in circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances which rendered that knowledge impoſſible he could not, on any principle of juſtice, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as having conſented to their alienation. In the abovementioned caſe the woman, tho' ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of her title, was in a ſituation which ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:035588_0047_1005F7AD0DC567E8"/>her to become acquainted with it by proper attention and enquiry<note n="*" place="bottom">See alſo the caſe of Hobbs, v. Norton, 1. Equi. la. Abr. 356.</note>. And the United States alſo might eaſily have acquired the moſt complete knowledge of their claim to the land in queſtion.</p>
            <p>In caſes moreover, of mere ſilent acquieſcence, a party might perhaps be allowed to diſprove his own knowledge. Even this would be very doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. But where he had given poſitive and expreſs confirmation to the right of the ſeller, and had thus encouraged the purchaſer to buy, he could never be allowed to claim the property in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to his own declarations. Silence about his right might be occaſioned, and therefore, perhaps, excuſed, by ignorance of it; but that ignorance could never be a ſufficient inducement, or a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, for his declaring the right to be in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. If he choſe ignorantly to make ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, he himſelf, not the innocent purchaſer, muſt abide the conſequence<note n="†" place="bottom">See the above acted caſe of Hobbs, v. Norton.</note>. In this predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the government of the United States; which not content with ſilently acquieſcing in the acts of Georgia, has made the ſtrongeſt declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in favour of her right.</p>
            <p>And laſtly there is good reaſon to believe that the government was actually apprized of its right to this land. The extenſion of Florida, took place in 1770. In 1777 the Indian claims in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tehez diſtrict, which lies within the limits of this extenſion, were extinguiſhed by the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. At the treaty held at Hopewell, in 1786, between the United States and the Chacktaws, the former, in order to preclude the Indians from the Natehez diſtrict, availed themſelves of this extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhment:
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:035588_0048_1005F7B065112E78"/>and as for obvious reaſons, they could not have ſuppoſed it to have been made for the benefit of any other government than Florida, Georgia having then declared itſelf independent, it was notice to them that the Britiſh had extended the juriſdiction of that province. Their claim is founded on this extenſion; of which if they did not in this manner receive complete notice, they had ſuch intimation at leaſt, as not only made it incumbent on them to enquire fully into the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<note n="*" place="bottom">See the caſe of Hoobs, and Norton.</note>, but pointed out the ſource from whence all neceſſary information might be drawn.</p>
            <p>But it may be aſked, if the government was apprized of theſe circumſtances, why did it omit to urge them in its negociations with Spain? The reaſon is obvious. To have urged them would have defeated its own claim. It could claim this country as part of the United States, on the ground only that it was not a part of Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rida. To have ſhewn that it had become a part of that province before the treaty of peace, would have eſtabliſhed the claim of Spain; for Florida was ceded to her previouſly to the defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive treaty between Great-Britain, and us; and it is on the definitive treaty that our claim reſted. It was the buſineſs of our government therefore to keep this matter out of view; and fortunately for us, it ſeems to have been unknown to the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards. Certainly it was much wiſer to retain this country, as part of the United States, even at the expence of giving it to Georgia, than to yield it to Spain. If our government choſe to purſue that courſe, and by its conduct and aſſertions individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als have been induced, confiding in its authority, to regard Georgia as the owner of theſe lands and to purchaſe from her, with what juſtice could the United States now attempt to deprive them of the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:035588_0049_1005F7B2D36A4E70"/>property? Is government, contrary to every rule of law, to take advantage of its own acts in order to injure others, and to puniſh them for having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fided in its ſolemn declarations?</p>
            <p>But were not the purchaſers themſelves acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this right, or at leaſt bound to take notice of it? And in that caſe did they not purchaſe at their own riſk? The anſwer to this alſo is obvious. Had the United States been acquieſcent, had they remained ſilent and paſſive only, the purchaſers might have been conſidered, perhaps, as taking at their own riſk: but when Georgia openly claimed and exerciſed the right, and the United States not only made no objection but aided the claim by their poſitive declarations, the purchaſers were bound to look no further. Even had the claim of the government been matter of record<note n="*" place="bottom">See the caſe of Arnot v. Biſcoe, 1. Veg. 96.</note>, or had they been expreſsly informed of its exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence<note n="†" place="bottom">Caſe of Hobbs, v. Norton ante.</note>, yet would their purchaſe have been valid under theſe circumſtances of encouragement, by the government itſelf.</p>
            <p>It ſeems clear therefore, that as the party ſelling not only claimed the right, but had the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of poſſeſſing it, which appearance was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the acquieſcence, and even the expreſs declaration of the true owners, this ſale, in the caſe of an individual, would be completely valid and binding in law.</p>
            <p>But will the ſame rules apply to a government? This is the point next to be examined.</p>
            <p>In the Engliſh law, from which moſt of our maxims of juriſprudence are derived, it is a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived principle that the king who repreſents the government, and in whom the public property is legally veſted, can be made ameanable to no kind of proceſs; that to him no fraud, no improprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:035588_0050_1005F7B461BB7B98"/>no negligence even, can be imputed. Yet if he ſhould do a wrongful act, as making an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper grant, for inſtance, the court of Chancery would give redreſs to the party injured, and even ſet aſide the grant, if neceſſary, on the ground that the king had been deceived. This proves two things; firſt that the acts of government are ſubject to the rules of law and juſtice, although the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment itſelf cannot be brought to anſwer in a Legal proceſs: And ſecondly, that the inability of the government to do wrong is a mere fiction, which the judicial power explains a way in favour of juſtice, whenever it can. They will not ſay that the act was done thro' negligence or an improper intention, but through deception; yet if in fact wrongful, they will ſet it aſide, whenever it is of ſuch a nature as to be ſubjected to their controul.</p>
            <p>This being the caſe even in England, whoſe monarchieal government is ſuppoſed to require a ſacred inviolability in the chief Magiſtrate, the ſame maxims ſhould obtain more readily and in greater extent among us, as being far more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genial to the nature and principles of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Accordingly we find that the idea of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the acts of government to the rules of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial diciſion is perfectly familiar in our conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions. Our courts make no difficulty of declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ligiſlative acts void, even thoſe of the Union, where they are contrary to the Conſtitution. This is founded on the principle that the ligiſlatures in making ſuch acts, have exceeded their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. Why ſhould not the acts of government in other inſtances alſo, be ſubjected to the rules of law and the maxims of juſtice? Why ſhould not this ſalutary controul of the judicial power, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all caſes where the acts complained of
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:035588_0051_1005F7B7E1F54878"/>can be brought within its reach? There ſeems to exiſt, be good reaſon to the contrary. Our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment poſſeſſes land which it is in the practice of ſelling to individuals; and it appoints agents for that purpoſe, with proper powers and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. If after one of theſe agents had made a ſale perſuant to his powers, the government ſhould attempt to reclaim the land or ſell it again, would not the judicial power protect the title of the firſt purchaſer? Would it not enquire into the validity of the ſecond ſale whenever it became the ſubject of litigation, and declare it void, even if made by an expreſs law? There ſeems no doubt on this head. If then the judicial power would enforce the rules of law and juſtice as to one mode of diſpoſing of property by the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, why ſhould it not equally enforce them as to other modes? And we know that a perſon may as effectually diſpoſe of his Land by ſtanding by, while another ſells it, as by ſelling it himſelf.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, there does not ſeem to be any reaſon why the ſame rules which have been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed on this ſubject reſpecting individuals ſhould not equally apply to the acts of government. From whence it would reſult that the United States, having not only acquieſced in all the acts of ownerſhip exerciſed by the State of Georgia over this Land, and in the ultimate ſale of it, but alſo ſupported and given colour to the right of that State by expreſs declarations in its favour, will be bound by the ſale. This opinion however cannot be poſitively pronounced. The matter is attended by many difficulties; and the diciſion, in ſome of its moſt important parts, reſts not on authority, but on reaſonings, the force of which muſt be judged of in the courts. There perhaps a very different view of the ſubject may may be entertained.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:035588_0052_1005F7BA8CDA63D8"/>
The claims of the United States, which opened the firſt, and far the moſt extenſive field of enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, having been thus ſurveyed, the repealing act of Georgia now preſents itſelf for conſideration.</p>
            <p>This act it is to be obſerved in the firſt place does not profeſs to <hi>repeal</hi> the act of January 7th 1795, but declares it void. The reaſons for this mode of proceeding are obvious. The act of January 7th had produced its whole effect. The ſales which it directed had been completely made, the money paid, and grants paſſed. It could not therefore have been at all affected by a repeal: for it is a well known principle that to repeal a law, far from undoing what has already been done under it, can only prevent its future operation. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to deſtroy theſe ſales therefore—which was the object aimed at by the legiſlature—it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to do ſomething more than repeal the law it was neceſſary to declare it originally void.</p>
            <p>A ſingle obſervation, which preſents itſelf here, might decide the queſtion on this repealing law It is this; that the force, validity or meaning of a legiſlative act is purely a judicial queſtion, and altogether beyond the province of the legiſlature It is the province of the legiſlative power to make laws, to give them their exiſtence; but to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound and enforce them belongs to the judiciary. The judicial power is to declare what the law <hi>is;</hi> the legiſlative, what it <hi>ſhall be.</hi> The legiſlature therefore may repeal one of its own acts; that is, may declare that it ſhall not hereafter be law: but ſhould it go further, and declare that it is void, that it is not now law, it ſteps beyond its powers; and its proceedings become null.</p>
            <p>This is a fundamental principle of all our conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, which declare that the judicial and legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive powers ſhall be diſtinct and ſeparate. It reſults
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035588_0053_1005F7BC1BF8FAF0"/>alſo from the very exiſtence of a written conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which, by its neceſſary operation, preſcribes limits to the legiſlative body, and confides the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and maintainance of thoſe limits to the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial power. As well might the legiſlature try cauſes, or hear appeals, as attempt to expound, enforce, or declare void one of its own acts; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſo far as might relate to the <hi>future</hi> operation of ſuch act. Its validity, ſo far as might relate to its former operation, to acts already done under its authority, is a queſtion which the courts of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice alone not the legiſlature are competent to decide.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſales moreover were contracts, made with the utmoſt ſolemnity, for a valuable conſideration, and carried deliberately into complete execution. It is an invariable maxim of law and of natural juſtice, that one of the parties to a contract can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by his own act, exempt himſelf, from its obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. A contrary principle would break down all the ramparts of right, diſolve the bonds of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and render good faith, to enforce the obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of which is the great object of civil inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſubſervient to the partiality, the ſelfiſhneſs, and the unjuſt caprices of every individual. There is no reaſon why governments, more than private perſons, ſhould be exempt from the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this mixim; nor are they conſidered as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt by our conſtitution or our laws. The ſtate of Georgia, being a party to this contract, could no more relieve itſelf from the obligation, by any act of its own, than an individual who had ſigned a bond could relieve himſelf from the neceſſity of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there were ſufficient grounds for relief in either caſe, the ſtate or the individual muſt reſort to the courts of juſtice, where it would be afforded: but the acts of the one and the other for relieving themſelves would be equally and eſſentially negatory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:035588_0054_1005F7BE9EC895B0"/>
The act of Georgia therefore can have no legal effect.<note n="*" place="bottom">Is ſatisfactory to find this opinion corroborated by that of a very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Lawer in Newyork who was ſometime ago conſulted on this point— See Col Hamilton's opinion; apendix No 17.</note> It can be regarded only as a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtating the grounds on which that ſtate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives itſelf intitled to relief from the contract in queſtion. As ſuch a declaration however, from ſo reſpectable a body as the legiſlature of a ſtate, cannot fail to make a ſtrong impreſſion, it will be not improper to examine theſe grounds a little more minutely, in order that a better judgment may be formed about their ſufficiency.</p>
            <p>The ſales are declared void by this act, on two grounds. Firſt that the legiſlature had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional power to make them. Secondly that in paſſing the act for that purpoſe, it was influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by fraudulent and corrupt motives.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt, it is not improper to repeat that it is purely an object of judicial enquiry. Had the ſtate of Georgia, as it might have done, filed a bill in the ſupreme federal court againſt the purchaſers, to ſet aſide the ſales, one object of enquiry in that court would have been whether they they were made by ſufficient authority: and if it had found that they were not, they muſt have been ſet aſide. But who ever heard till this act was paſſed, that the legiſlatures under our conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions have not power to ſell the public proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or give it away? This has always been conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as one of the moſt eſſential branches of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative authority. It has been exerciſed by every legiſlature in the Union; and by that of Georgia, in numerous inſtances. If the legiſlature has a right to diſpoſe of the public lands, which cannot be deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it may diſpoſe of them in what quantities and
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:035588_0055_1005F7C04A7E7A48"/>on what conditions it thinks fit: for the right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unreſtricted, ſo muſt be its exerciſe.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ground, the ground of fraud and corruption, was equally a ſubject of judicial inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. There cannot be a doubt that if a legiſlative body in making a contract, has been impoſed on, it will, equally with an individual, be intitled to relief; but, like an individual, it muſt ſeek this relief in a court of juſtice. In a bill filed in this caſe for ſetting aſide the ſales, the allegation of fraud would have been enquired into, and, if ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by proper proof, would no doubt have been a ſufficient ground for relief. This courſe the ſtate might have purſued. In this manner it might have obtained whatever remedy it is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled to in law and juſtice.</p>
            <p>But what is the nature of the fraud complained of; and by what proof is the charge ſupported?</p>
            <p>The act does not pretend that the legiſlature which made theſe ſales was deceived, was impoſed on; but that ſome individuals among them were corrupted. Do the circumſtances alledged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to corruption? Can the motives of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual members be enquired into, in order to inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate the acts of a legiſlative body?</p>
            <p>It is alledged by the act "That a majority of thoſe members of the legiſlature who voted in favour of the ſales, were engaged in the purchaſe." There are various other vague and general charges, but this is the only ſpecific fact alledged. It is not even pretended that a majority of the legiſlature was concerned, but only "A majority of thoſe who voted for the ſales." Admitting this to be true, was it an act of corruption? It might be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered perhaps as an impropriety; but on what ground can it be ſtigmatized as corrupt? It is not ſtated that thoſe perſons were bribed; that
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:035588_0056_1005F7C3C87B10F8"/>they were to receive money for their votes, or even to have part of the land without paying for it; but ſimply that they were concerned in the purchaſe. But are there no other than corrupt motives which could induce a member to vote for a ſale of public property, in which he himſelf was concerned? Might he not regard the ſale, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as it was of lands, the benefit of which to the public depends on their being cultivated, as advantageous to the ſtate as well as to the purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers? Might it not in fact be ſo? It is a rule of law that if an act can be fairly accounted for on proper motives, corrupt ones ſhall not be preſumed.</p>
            <p>But it is believed that a legiſlative act can never be invalidated on account of the motives from which it may have been agreed to by individual members: that thoſe motives can never be brought into queſtion. Could ſuch enquiries be inſtituted where could be the end of them? By what mode of proof ſhould they be conducted? What a door would be opened to fraud and uncertainty of every kind! The very foundations of legiſlative authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would be ſhaken; and all its acts might be nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified by the fraud or the artifices of individuals. If the legiſlature, conſidered as an individual, have been impoſed on, like an individual it may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved: if it have exceeded the bounds of its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, its acts are null; but the motives of its members can never be queſtioned without ſtriking at the root of law, and introducing ſcenes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion a thouſand times more intolerable, then any evils which it could intended to remedy.</p>
            <p>The proofs of this corruption, which come next to be conſidered, are ſtated by the act under four heads: affidavits; preſentments of grand juries; petitions and remonſtrances; and the circumſtance
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:035588_0057_1005F7C71112D980"/>of a larger ſum having been rejected for the ſame property.</p>
            <p>It is well known that the preſentments of a grand jury are never admitted as evidence in courts of juſtice. Even the teſtimony on which they are founded is, for the moſt part, of ſuch a nature that it could not be received there. They ſerve as the foundations of enquiry, but never as proof of a fact. Such of the preſentments in queſtion as have been ſeen, even if they were admitted as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, would prove nothing; for they either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the ſales in general terms, as injurious to the public and improperly obtained, or merely ſtate the fact of ſome members having been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, or requeſted to be ſo, in the purchaſe.</p>
            <p>Still leſs can remonſtrances and petitions be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied on in the deciſion of legal rights. The means by which they are frequently obtained, and the ſlight grounds whereon they ſometimes reſt, are too well known to need any obſervations.</p>
            <p>As to the rejection of a larger offer, it may have been a very wiſe ſtep. The ſecurity may have been deemed inſufficient. The offer may have been conſidered as deluſive. It is not known by the counſel much leſs inſinuated, that this was the caſe; but it is ſufficient that it may have been ſo conſidered by the legiſlature, and therefore may have furniſhed them with a very upright tho' perhaps ill-judged motive, for their rejection. The fact is that the offer was made by only four or five individuals; while the companies who purchaſed conſiſted of a very conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. The latter alſo paid a large ſum in advance, which it is not underſtood that the former propoſed. Under theſe circumſtances, ſurely it is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to reſort to corrupt motives for the preference.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="unknown:035588_0058_1005F7C89D633180"/>
On the ſubject of the affidavits, all of which have been carefully examined, ſeveral important obſervations occur.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place they were ex parte; taken in private, before a committee of the houſe of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives; the witneſſes not confronted with thoſe perſons againſt whom their teſtimony was to ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; not ſubjected to croſs-examination. The admiſſion of teſtimony taken in this manner is no leſs contradictory to the practice of every court known to the American conſtitutions, than to the plain principles of natural juſtice. Had thoſe wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes been croſs-examined, it is impoſſible to tell what circumſtances might have appeared to give a different complexion to the whole caſe. In teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony too not delivered from the mouth of the witneſs himſelf, but taken in writing and taken by one ſide only, it is natural to preſume that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever makes in favour of that ſide will be more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly dwelt on, and more ſtrongly expreſſed; while ſuch parts as ſeem oppoſed to it are apt to be either omitted or ſtated imperfectly. This ariſes from the natural imperfection of the human mind, from the effect of our paſſions on our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and our conduct. Hence has reſulted a rule which is invariably obſerved in all our courts; that teſtimony is never admitted, unleſs both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have had an opportunity of joining in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination.</p>
            <p>In the caſe of theſe affidavits it is affirmed that the examining committee refuſed to take down material parts of the teſtimony actually given by the witneſſes, and tending to exculpate the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers accuſed of corruption.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Affidavits of Flourney v. Clayton.</note> In the uncertainty that there is, whether this fact may not have been
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:035588_0059_1005F7CB1C810AF8"/>miſunderſtood, the reſpect due to ſuch a body as the committee of a legiſlative aſſembly repreſſes thoſe remarks to which, of true, it muſt give riſe.</p>
            <p>But the evidence itſelf, if properly taken, is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to many ſtrong objections.</p>
            <p>In ſome inſtances it is contradictory<note n="*" place="bottom">Affidavits of James Tyroll, and Ruſſel Jones.</note> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural<note n="†" place="bottom">De. and Philip Clayton and John Thomas.</note>? It depends in a great degree on hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay<note n="‡" place="bottom">See Affidavids throughout</note>, which the beſt known rules of law, and the dictates of common juſtice, concur in rejecting. It conſiſts almoſt wholly of the confeſſions of members made, not to the legiſlature or the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, but to the witneſſes, about the impropriety of their own conduct; and finally the whole ſcope of it is to prove that certain members, who voted for the law, were actuated by corrupt motives; a point which it has been ſhewn, can never be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired into for the purpoſe of invalidating a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative act.</p>
            <p>It is worthy of remark alſo that the members who appear by theſe affidavits to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the contract, were to pay their portion of the purchaſe money.<note n="§" place="bottom">See affidavits of van Allen, Rains, and Lucas.</note> There is indeed one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the contrary; but it is proved by the hearſay confeſſion, not of the member himſelf, but of a perſon who declared himſelf to be one of the purchaſers<note n="§" place="bottom">Do. of James M. Niel.</note>.</p>
            <p>This teſtimony therefore, whether its ſubſtance be regarded or the manner of its being taken, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears equally defective.</p>
            <p>But if it were leſs ſo, if the proofs of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the legiſlature were not only admiſſible but ſtrong, they would be greatly counter balanced by the conduct of the governor. He has never
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:035588_0060_1005F7CE816573D0"/>been accuſed, or even ſuſpected, of corruption. It can hardly be conceived, that, pure himſelf, he would have aided the corruption of others; would have ſanctioned an act which he knew to have originated in motives ſo flagitious. Had theſe practices exiſted, it is next to impoſſible that they ſhould have eſcaped his knowledge; for he was not only on the ſpot, and well acquainted with all the actors in this buſineſs, but lived in the cloſeſt connection and intimacy with ſome of its warmeſt oppoſers<note n="*" place="bottom">A Leading member of the Senate, who was the governor's ſon-in-law and lived in his houſe was one of the moſt ſtrenuous in oppoſition.</note>.</p>
            <p>It cannot be pretended that the governor coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced this act through deference of the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature; for the ſame motive would have led him to concur in the firſt bill which however was rejected. He muſt therefore have aſſented to the ſecond, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he found it free from thoſe objections which had operated againſt the firſt; and conſidered it as conducive to the public good. Why may not the legiſlature be concieved to have acted from the ſame motives? Muſt corruption be reſorted to in order to find a reaſon for their doing an act, which the governor, equally enlightened with them, was led to by a ſenſe of duty?</p>
            <p>Thus it ſeems clear that the legiſlature of Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia was wholly incompetent to ſet aſide this act, even had there been ſufficient grounds; becauſe this is a judicial, not a legiſlative function, and becauſe the ſale was a contract to which the ſtate itſelf was a party: that had the legiſlature been competent, the evidence on which it proceeded was not only inconcluſive, but altogether inadmiſſible: And that, ſince to diſpoſe of the public land is one of the moſt undeniable powers of the legiſlature, and
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:035588_0061_1005F7D11992D060"/>the motives of members, even if corrupt, which in this caſe is far from being eſtabliſhed, cannot be alledged againſt the validity of a legiſlative act, there was no ground, either of unconſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionality or corruption, upon which, even in a competent tribunal, this act could have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared void.</p>
            <p>It is proper to add that even if this contract could be ſet aſide, an essential condition of doing ſo muſt be the repayment of the purchaſe money. It is one of the moſt obvious improprieties in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing act, that it attempts to deſtroy the purchaſe without making the leaſt proviſion, or even ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, for their repayment<note n="*" place="bottom">See note page 31.</note>. If, as it has been aſſerted, the legiſlature which paſſed the repealing act made an appropriation of part of this money, it was a complete confirmation, as far as depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on them, of the contract which they avowed an intention of annulling<note n="†" place="bottom">See the caſe of Cole v. Gibbons. P. W.</note>.</p>
            <p>From this view of the two points ſubmitted, taken under all thoſe aſpects which were declared important, the underſigned counſel is led to the following concluſion, which he certifies as his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: 1. That the United States never had a right to any part of the lands in queſtion, above a line drawn due eaſt from the mouth of the Ya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zoo: 2. That, under circumſtances of the caſe, they will probably be conſidered, in the courts of equity, as bound by the ſales which have been made by the ſtate of Georgia below that line: And 3. That the title of the purchaſers, either above or below, can in no degree be affected by the repealing act of that State.</p>

               <p>Whereas we have taken into our royal conſideration the extenſive and valuable acquiſitions in America, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to our crown by the late difinitive treaty of peace concluded at Paris the 10th day of February laſt; and being deſirous that all our loving ſubjects, as well of our kingdoms as of our colonies in America, may avail them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, with all convenient ſpeed, of the great benefits and advantages which muſt accrue therefrom to their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, manufactures, and navigation; we have thought
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:035588_0064_1005F7D8BA887B58"/>fit with the advice of our privy council, to iſſue this royal proclamation, hereby to publiſh and declare to all our loving ſubjects, that we have, with the advice of our ſaid privy council, granted our letters patent under our great ſeal of Great-Britain, to erect within the countries and iſlands, ceded and confirmed to us by the ſaid treaty, four diſtinct and ſeparate governments, ſtiled and called by the names of Quebec, Eaſt Florida, and Weſt Florida, and Grenada, and limited and bounded as follows, viz.</p>
               <p>Firſt the government of Quebec, bounded on the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brador coaſt by the river St. John, and from thence by a line drawn from the head of that river, through the lake St. John, to the ſouth end of the lake Nipiſſim; from whence the ſaid line, croſſing the river St. Lawrence and the lake Champlain in 45 degrees of north latitude, paſſes along the highlands, which divide the rivers that empty themſelves into the ſaid river St. Lawrence from thoſe which fall into the ſea; and alſo along the north coaſt of the Bay des Chaleurs, and the coaſt of the Gulph of St. Lawrence to Cape Roſieres, and from thence croſſing the mouth of the river St. Lawrence by the weſt end of the iſland of Anticoſti, terminates at the aforeſaid river St. John.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The government of Eaſt Florida, bounded to the weſtward by the Gulph of Mexico and the Apala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicola river; to the northward, by a line drawn from that part of the ſaid river where the Chatahouchee and Flint rivers meet, to the ſource of St. Mary's river, and by the courſe of the ſaid river to the Atlantic Ocean, and to the eaſt and ſouth by the Atlantic Ocean, and the Gulph of Florida, including all iſlands within ſix leagues of the ſea coaſt.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the government of Weſt Florida, bounded to the ſouthward by the Gulph of Mexico, including all iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands within ſix leagues of the coaſt from the river Apala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicola to lake Pontchartrain; to the weſtward by the ſaid lake, the lake Maurepas, and the river Miſſiſſippi; to the northward, by a line drawn due eaſt from that part of the river Miſſiſſippi which lies in thirty-one degrees north la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, to the river Apalachicola, or Catahouchee; and to the eaſtward by the ſaid river.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The government of Grenada, comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the iſland of that name, together with the Grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dines,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:035588_0065_1005F7DB1CB1EE98"/>and the iſlahds of Dominico, St. Vincent, and Tobago.</p>
               <p>And to the end that the open and free fiſhery of our ſubjects may be extended to, and carried on upon the coaſt of Labrador and the adjacent iſlands, we have thought fit, with the advice of our ſaid privy council, to put all that coaſt from the river St. John's to Hudſon's Streights, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the iſlands of Anticoſti and Madelaine, and all other ſmaller iſlands lying upon the ſaid coaſt, under the care and inſpection of our governor of Newfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               <p>We have alſo, with the advice of our privy council, thought fit to annex the iſlands of St. John, and Cape Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, or Iſle Royale, with the leſſer iſlands adjacent there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to to our government of Nova-Scotia.</p>
               <p>We have alſo, with the advice of our privy council aforeſaid, annexed to our province of Georgia, all the lands lying between the rivers Alatamaha and St. Mary's.</p>
               <p>And whereas it will greatly contribute to the ſpeedy ſettling our ſaid new governments, that our loving ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects ſhould be informed of our paternal care for the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the liberties and properties of thoſe who are, and ſhall become inhabitants thereof; we have thought fit to publiſh and declare, by this our proclamation, that we have, in the letters patent under our great ſeal of Great-Britain, by which the ſaid governments are conſtituted, given expreſs power and direction to our governors of our ſaid colonies reſpectively, that ſo ſoon as the ſtate and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the ſaid colonies will admit thereof, they ſhall, with the advice and conſent of the members of our council, ſummon and call general aſſemblies within the ſaid governments reſpectively, in ſuch manner and form as is uſed and directed in thoſe colonies and provinces in America, which are under our immediate government; and we have alſo given power to the ſaid governors, with the conſent of our ſaid councils, and the repreſentatives of people, ſo to be ſummoned as aforeſaid, to make, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and ordain laws, ſtatutes, and ordinances for the public peace, welfare, and good government of our ſaid colonies, and of the people and inhabitants thereof, as near as may be agreeable to the laws of England, and under ſuch regulations and reſtrictions as are uſed in other colonies; and in the mean time time, and until ſuch aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:035588_0066_1005F7DCA938F698"/>can be called as aforeſaid, all perſons inhabiting in, or reſorting to our ſaid colonies may confide in our royal protection for the enjoyment of the benefit of the laws of our realm of England; for which purpoſe we have given power under our great ſeal to the governors of our ſail colonies reſpectively, to erect and conſtitute, with the advice of our ſaid councils reſpectively, courts of judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cature and public juſtice within our ſaid colonies, for the hearing and determining all cauſes, as well criminal as ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, according to law and equity, and as near as may be, agreeable to the laws of England, with liberty to all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who may think themſelves aggrieved by the ſentence of ſuch courts, in all civil caſes, to appeal, under the uſual limitations and reſtrictions, to us in our privy council.</p>
               <p>We have alſo thought fit with the advice of our privy council as aforeſaid, to give unto the governors and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of our ſaid three new colonies upon the continent; full power and authority to ſettle and agree with the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of our ſaid new colonies, or to any other perſons who ſhall reſort thereto, for ſuch lands, tenements, and hereditaments, as are now, or hereafter ſhall be, in our power to diſpoſe of, and them to grant to any ſuch perſon or perſons, upon ſuch terms, and under ſuch moderate quit-rents, ſervices and acknowledgments, as have been appointed and ſettled in other colonies, and under ſuch other conditions as ſhall appear to us to be neceſſary and expedient for the advantage of the grantees, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement and ſettlement of our ſaid colonies.</p>
               <p>And whereas we are deſirous, upon-all occaſions, to teſtify our royal ſenſe and approbation of the conduct and bravery of the officers and ſoldiers of our armies, and to reward the ſame, we do hereby command and impower our governors of our ſaid three new colonies, and other our governors of our ſeveral provinces on the continent of North America, to grant without ſee or reward, to ſuch reduced officers as have ſerved in North America during the late war, and are actually reſiding there, and ſhall perſonally apply for the ſame, the following quantities of land, ſubject, at the expiration of ten years, to the ſame quit-rents as other land are ſubject to, in the province within which they are granted, as alſo ſubject to the ſame conditions of cultivation and improvements, viz.</p>

               <p>We do likewiſe authoriſe and require the governors and commanders in chief of all our ſaid colonies upon the continent of North America, to grant the like quantities of land, and upon the ſame conditions, to ſuch reduced officers of our navy of like rank, as ſerved on board our ſhips of war in North America, at the times of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Louiſburg and Quebec, in the late war, and who ſhall perſonally apply to our reſpective governors for ſuch grants.</p>
               <p>And whereas it juſt and reaſonable, and eſſential to our intereſt, and the ſecurity or our colonies, that the ſeveral nations or tribes of Indians, with whom we are connected, and who live under our protection, ſhould not be moleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or diſturbed in the poſſeſſion of ſuch parts of our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions and territories as, not having been ceded to, or purchaſed by us, are reſerved to them, or any of them, as their hunting grounds; we do therefore, with the advice of our privy council, declare it to be our royal will and pleaſure, that no governor or commander in chief, in any of our colonies of Quebec, Eaſt Florida, or Weſt Florida, do preſume, upon any pretence whatever, to grant warrants of ſurvey, or paſs any patents for lands beyond the bounds of their reſpective governments, as diſcribed by their commiſſions; as alſo that no governor or commander in chief of our other colonies or plantations in America, do preſume for the preſent, and until our further pleaſure be known, to grant warrants of ſurvey, or paſs patents for any lands beyond the heads or ſources of any of the rivers which fall into the Atlantic Ocean from the weſt or north weſt; or upon any lands whatever, which not having been ceded to, or purchaſed by us, as aforeſaid, are reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ſaid Indians, or any of them.</p>
               <p>And we do further declare it to be our royal will and pleaſure for the preſent, as aforeſaid, to reſerve under our ſovereignty, protection and dominion for the uſe of the ſaid Indians, all the land and territories not included with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits of our ſaid three new governments or within the limits of the territory granted to the Hudſon's Bay company; as alſo all the land and territories lying to the

               <p>And we do further ſtrictly enjoin and require all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whatever, who have either wilfully or inadvertent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeated themſelves upon any lands within the countries above deſcribed, or upon any other lands, which not having been ceded to, or purchaſed by us, are ſtill reſerved to the ſaid Indians as aforeſaid, forthwith to remove themſelves from ſuch ſettlements.</p>
               <p>And whereas great frauds and abuſes have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the purchaſing lands of the Indians, to the great prejudice of our intereſts, and to the great diſſatisfaction of the ſaid Indians; in order, therefore, to prevent ſuch interruption for the future, and to the end that the Indians may be convinced of our juſtice and determined reſolution to remove all reaſonable cauſe of diſcontent, we do, with the advice of our privy council, ſtrictly enjoin and equire that no private perſon do preſume to make any purchace from the ſaid Indians, of any lands reſerved to the ſaid Indians, within thoſe parts of our colonies where we have thought proper to allow ſettlement; but that if at any time any of the ſaid Indians ſhould be inclined to diſpoſe of the ſaid lands, the ſame ſhall be purchaſed only for us, in our name, at ſome public meeting or aſſembly of the ſaid Indians, to be held for that purpoſe by the governor or commander in chief of our colony reſpectively within which they ſhall lie: and in caſe they ſhall lie within the limits of any proprietaries, conformable to ſuch directions and inſtructions as we or they ſhill think proper to give for that purpoſe: and we do, by the advice of our privy council, declare and enjoin, that the trade with the ſaid Indians ſhall be free and open to all our ſubjects what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, provided that every perſon who may incline to trade with the ſaid Indians, do take out a licence for carrying on ſuch trade, from the governor or commander in chief of any of our colonies reſpectively, where ſuch perſon ſhall reſide, and alſo give ſecurity to obſerve ſuch regulations as we ſhall at any time think fit, by our ſelves or commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to be appointed for this purpoſe, to direct and appoint

               <p>
                  <hi>Art.</hi> VI. The commiſſioners on the part of the ſtate of South-Carolina do not by any of the above articles mean to cede, relinquiſh or weaken the right, title and claim of any individual citizens of the ſtate of South-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina to any land ſituated in Georgia, particularly to the lands ſituated to the ſouth or ſouth-weſt of the river Alata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maha, and granted during the adminiſtration of governor Boone, in 1763, and they do hereby declare, that the right and title of the ſaid citizens to the ſame, is and ought to remain as full, ſtrong and effectual as if this convention had not been made.

                  <hi>No. XIII. AUGUSTA, January 28.</hi> To the Preſident and Fellow-Citizens of the Senate.</head>
               <p>The Senate and houſe of Repreſentatives are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutionally convened for legiſlative deliberations, and at
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:035588_0095_1005F822A61BF370"/>a time too when the minds of our fellow-Citizens are, and have been for ſome time paſt more engaged in diſcuſſing the conduct of the laſt legiſlature on the ſubject of the act for diſpoſing of part of our Weſtern Territory to certain companies, than perhaps has ever been experienced ſince this State aſſumed rank with her ſiſter States—it will, no doubt be amongſt the moſt important matters that may engroſs your attention to enquire on what ground this act was founded, and if a conſtitutional and legal remedy can applied to calm the minds of our fellow citizens on this intereſting ſubject: in my opinion it requires and I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myſelf will receive your moſt ſerious delibiration, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a law can be conſtitutionally made to repeal another that has been fully carried into effect, as the one now in queſtion, the companies having paid into the treaſury the whole of the purchaſe money, and cancelled their mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages; and whether, if repealed the remedy may not be even worſe than the diſeaſe. But if a law can be deviſed that will conſtitutionally repeal the one referred to, and guard againſt future murmurs and well grounded com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt the repeal, I have no doubt but the man you may honour with the appointment of the chief Magiſtrate, will readily deem it a duty cheerfully to coperate.</p>
               <p>It is a matter much to be regretted (conſidering the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourable light the act for diſpoſing of our Weſtern Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory has been viewed in) that the ſpirit of party reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and perſonal reflections ſhould have ran ſo high in many inſtances; the public mind has been inflamed by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair repreſentations, and our newſpapers have teemed with perſonal abuſe and invective—this I remark from having experienced the public ſlander; endeavours have been made to calumniate my character by falſe reports, ſuch as that the motives which induced me to give my aſſent to the ſecond act, proceeded from private intereſt, regardleſs of the ſacred duty I owed to the ſtation I filled, and the rights, and intereſts, of my fellow-citizens—conſcious of the purity of my intentions, and ſupported by the Juſtice and integrity of my actions, I have treated with ſilent contempt thoſe baſe and malicious reports, and I now defy the blackeſt and the moſt perſevering malice aided by diſappointed avarice, to produce one ſingle evidence of my ever having been intereſted in the ſale to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of one ſingle farthing: but whilſt I treated with
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:035588_0096_1005F8246ECC6860"/>neglect thoſe reports ſo injurious to my character I feel it a reſpect due to you and a duty I owe to my reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to give you a candid and fair ſtatement of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which actuated me on a ſubject which has ſo much diſturbed the citizens of Georgia. On the 25th day of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, 1794, an act for diſpoſing of part of our Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Territory to four companies, was preſented to me for my concurrence; after the moſt mature reflection my judgment was capable of, I thought it my duty to refuſe my aſſent, and aſſigned my reaſons, which I flattered my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would have poſtponed any further legiſlative proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the law, until the next meeting of the houſe: but in that I was miſtaken. The firſt idea that occurred to ſome of the members when the bill was returned with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, was that I ſhould be impeached for an unconſtitution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al act—yet the more cool reflection of the houſe terminated in appointing a committee to confer with me on my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections and to know if it was in the power of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature to frame a bill for the ſale of the land which would meet my concurrence. On the conference I was led to believe that the committee was convinced, my reaſons for rejecting the law did not proceed from "Executive ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance, or from a wiſh to bring into action a power heretofore dormant in our proceedings, or from a propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in me to do an act of ſo great reſponſibility; but from a conviction that it would tend to the real intereſt of the State—the reflecting mind will eaſily perceive how much the reſponſibility would be enhanced by rejecting a bill that the legiſlature might paſs for the ſale of the lands; after being in poſſeſſion of my remarks, even ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it to be ſimilar to the firſt: but when it appears that three of the moſt important objections I had made to the firſt law were removed, I think there is no man of cool diſpaſſionate reflection that would have refuſed his aſſent to it for any reaſons ſhort of a clear proof of corruption in its paſſage through the legiſlature, <hi>and no ſuch infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation ever came to my knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After all the popular clamour the law has occaſioned, I ſhould depart from my uſual candour to ſay I have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver blamed myſelf either for an error of the head or a corruption of the heart, and on a ſimilar occaſion ſhould feel myſelf perfectly juſtified in purſuing a ſimilar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct: Much has been ſaid about unaſcertained millions
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:035588_0097_1005F82884B9CEF0"/>of acres being ſold and that more than fifty millions of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres are diſpoſed to the companies by that act: after having thought it my duty to act on the ſecond bill. I ordered the Surveyor General to furniſh me with as accurate a map of the country contemplated to be ſold, as any documents he had or could procure would afford—this was done, and is now on the file of the Executive, from which it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear there was no more than twenty-nine million 400,000 acres in the whole agregate the firſt law had in view, and one fourth of that quantity is now reſerved to the State and ſubject to her diſpoſition. This is a true ſtate of facts, ſo far as they have come to my knowledge, and if it may afford you any uſeful hints in your deliberations, it will give me pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The ſum of 500,000 dollars has been paid into your Treaſury in terms of the act, 50,000 of which has been realized in ſix per cent ſtock of the United States, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt ariſing therefrom ſince the purchaſe, amounting to 2201 dollars 29 cents has been paid into your Treaſury as alſo the intereſt ariſing from the ballance due to this State on the final ſettlement with the United States, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to 689 dollars 58 cents, and the Treaſurer's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts for the original certificates, ſtanding on the books of the loan office of the United States, are filed in the office of the cheque or the Treaſury—the ſum of 30,000 dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars ſtand appropriated for extinguiſhing the Indian claims to the land between the Oconee and Oakmulgee rivers, and 20,000 dollars have been applied to paying the members of the aſſembly, the members of the convention, and other creditors of the ſtate; 400,000 dollars remain now in your Treaſury ſubject to the appropriation of the preſent Legiſlature.</p>

Becauſe even ſuppoſing conſtitutional authority to have been veſted in the legiſlature for the purpoſe of ſuch diſpoſal, the legiſlature was not veſted with power to transfer the ſovereignty and juriſdiction of the ſtate over the territory attempted to be diſpoſed of, which it has done by opening a door for a ſale to foreign powers, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhment of the powers, of taxation until the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etors chooſe to be repreſented, which is in fact diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering the ſtate, and which transfer and relinquiſhment of taxation cannot be for the good of the ſtate.</p>
                  <p n="4">4th. Becauſe there was no neceſſity or preſſing urgency for the ſale of ſuch an immenſe tract of territory, equal to ſome European kingdoms, to carry into execution, and operation, the extinguiſhment of the Indian claims to the lands between the Oconee and Okmulgee, contemplated by the act entitled "An act for appropriating a part of the unlocated territory of this ſtate for payment of the late ſtate troops, and for other purpoſes therein mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;" the ſubterfuge on which the ſaid uſurped act of the ſeventh of January, one thouſand ſeven hundred and nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-five was founded, when the whole amount of the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:035588_0101_1005F85A0E1890F8"/>for that purpoſe was but thirty thouſand dollars, and funds to a greater amount were then in the treaſury unappropriated: And becauſe no ſtate or nation is juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in wantonly diſſipating its property or revenues, and a legal alienation of which can only take place from the moſt preſſing neceſſity; and the territory attempted to be diſpoſed of, was the ſaid uſurped law valid, was wantonly diſſipated, it being diſpoſed of for the trifling ſum of five hundred thouſand dollars, a ſum not adequate to the anu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al quit rents ſuch lands were charged with previouſly to the revolution of the britiſh King; which wanton diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation cannot be for the good of the ſtate.</p>
                  <p n="5">5th. Becauſe excluſive of the immenſe loſs of revenue to which the ſtate is expoſed from the relinquiſhment of taxation, the ſum of five hundred thouſand dollars was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as the conſideration money for the ſale, and the ſum of eight hundred thouſand dollars offered by perſons of as large a capital, and as much reſpectability and credit, and on terms more advantageous to the ſtate, was refuſed; which as it was (ſhould the ſaid uſurped act have been conſidered valid) a clear loſs of three hundred thouſand dollars to the revenues of the ſtate, it is evident that the law authoriſing the ſale was not deemed by the members of the legiſlature for "the good of the ſtate," which muſt have conſiſted in obtaining the higheſt price and the moſt advantageous terms.</p>
                  <p n="6">6th. For the very excellent reaſons given by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency the governor in his diſſent to the firſt bill for the diſpoſal of the ſaid territory, delivered to the houſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives on the twentyninth of December, one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſeven hundred and ninety-four, and which bill was not materially different from the act in queſtion; and which reaſons prove, that his excellency as a negative branch of the legiſlature, although he concurred in the law, did not deem it for "the good of the ſtate," and which diſſent was in the words following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1ſt. I doubt whether the proper time is arrived for diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of the territory in queſtion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2d. If it was the proper time, the ſum offered is inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the value of the land.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The quantity reſerved for the citizens is too ſmall, in proportion to the extent of the purchaſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4th. That greater advantages are ſecured to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers than to the citizens-</p>
                  <p n="5">
                     <pb n="99" facs="unknown:035588_0102_1005F830633A3810"/>
5th. That ſo large an extent of territory being diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of to companies of individuals, will operate as mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies, which will prevent or retard ſettlements, population and agricultuae.</p>
                  <p n="6">6th. That ſhould ſuch diſpoſition be made, at leaſt one fourth of the lands ſhould be reſerved for the future diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of the ſtate.</p>
                  <p n="7">7th. That if public notice was given, that the land was for ſale, the rivalſhip in purchaſers would moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably have increaſed the ſums offered.</p>
                  <p n="8">8th. The power given to the executive by the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, the duty I owe the community, and the ſacredneſs of my oath of office, I flatter myſelf, will juſtify this diſſent in the minds of the members of the legiſlature, and of my other fellow citizens.</p>
                  <p>And whereas the ſaid uſurped law paſſed on the ſeventh day of January, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ninety-five, is alſo repugnant to the afore cited ſixteenth ſection, in as much as it is repugnant to the ſeventeenth or ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ſection of the ſaid firſt article, which declares: They (the legiſlature) ſhall have power to alter the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries of the preſent counties, and to lay off new ones, as well out of the counties already laid off, as out of the other territory belonging to the ſtate. When a new county or counties ſhall be laid off out of any preſent county or counties, ſuch new county or counties ſhall have their repreſentation apportioned out of the number of repreſentatives of the county or counties out of which it or they ſhall be laid out, and when any new county ſhall be laid off in the vacant terrrity belonging to the ſtate, ſuch county ſhall have a number of repreſentatives not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding three, to be regulated and determined by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral aſſembly:" And the territory diſpoſed of not lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within the limits of any county already laid off, and a ſale and grant thereof, ſhould the ſaid uſurped law be deemed valid, having been made, it could not be defined the vacant territory belonging to the ſtate, whereby the conſtitutional powers veſted in the general aſſembly by the ſeventeenth ſection would be barred and prevented, and conſequentry the ſettlers on the territory ſold be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the conſtitutional right of repreſentation, and is not only thus repugnant to the ſaid ſixteenth and ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth ſections, but thereby and by the relinquiſhment of
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:035588_0103_1005F833D3DC88A0"/>the right of taxation, until the ſettlers are repreſented, which they cannot conſtitutionally be, is alſo repugnant to the whole letter and ſpirit of the conſtitution, in ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating as a dereliction of juriſdictional rights, and a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual diſmemberment of the ſtate.</p>
                  <p>And whereas in and by the articles of confederation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into and finally ratified on the firſt of March, one thouſand ſeven hundred and eighty one, by the then thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſtates of America, the territory within the limits of each of the ſaid ſtates is to each of them reſpectively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and guaranteed, firſt by the ſecond article, to wit, "Each ſtate retains its ſovereignty, freedom, and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, and power, juriſdiction and right, which is not by the confederation expreſſly delegated to the United States in Congreſs aſſembled." And ſecondly, by the laſt clauſe in the ſecond ſection of the ninth article, "No ſtate ſhall be deprived of territory for the benefit of the United States, "And in and by the firſt clauſe of the ſixth article of the federal conſtitution of the United States, All engagements entered into before the adoption of the ſaid conſtitution, ſhall be as valid againſt the United States under the ſaid conſtitution as under the confedera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:" and by the twelfth article of the amendments to the ſaid conſtitution, ratified and adopted, The powers not delegated to the United States by the conſtitution, nor prohibited by it to the ſtates are reſerved to the ſtates reſpectively or to the people."</p>
                  <p>And whereas in and by the definitive treaty of peace ſigned at Paris on the third of September, one thouſand ſeven hundred and eighty-three, the boundaries of the United. States were eſtabliſhed, and the United States ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recognized and acknowledged by the firſt article there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, in the words following: "His Britannic majeſty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledges the ſaid United States, viz.

<pb n="101" facs="unknown:035588_0104_1005F8364165C5D8"/>the ſaid United States may be prevented it is hereby a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed that the following are and ſhall be their bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries." And thoſe boundaries thereby declared, which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the weſtwardly and ſouthwardly parts of this ſtate, are thus defined: "Along the middle of the Miſſiſſippi until it ſhall interſect the northernmoſt part of the thirty-firſt degree of north latitude; ſouth by a line drawn due eaſt from the termination of the line laſt mentioned in the lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of thirty-one degrees north of the equator, to the middle of the river Apalachicola or Chatahooche: thence along the middle thereof to its junction with Flint river: thence ſtraight to the head of St. Mary's river; and thence along the middle of St. Mary's river to the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic ocean;" and the king of Great Britain did, by proclamation dated the ſeventh day of October, in the year one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſixty-three, annex to the then province of Georgia, all the lands laying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſaid river St. Mary's and the Alatamaha, its former boundary claimed by South-Carolina under her charters; and the ſtate of South-Carolina, in and by a convention held and concluded between the commiſſioners of the ſaid ſtates, at Beaufort, under the authority and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the confederation, on the twenty-eighth of April one thouſand ſeven hundred and eighty-ſeven, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm to the ſtate of Georgia the ſouthward and weſtward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly boundaries deſcribed in the ſaid treaty of Paris, by ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and relinquiſhment of all right, title and claim which the ſaid ſtate poſſeſſed from the original charter thereof, to the government, ſovereignty and juriſdiction in and over the ſame, and alſo the right of pre-emption of the ſoil from the native Indians, and all other the eſtate, property and claim, in or to the ſaid land; and the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries ſo deſcribed alſo coincide with the houndaries of this ſtate deſcribed by the land act of this ſtate now in force, paſſed at Savannah, the ſeventeenth of September, one thouſand ſeven hundred and eighty-three, (except as to the northern boundary of the ſtate) which by the ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention is thus eſtabliſhed and ratified by the firſt article thereof: "The moſt northern branch or ſtream of the river Savannah from the ſea or mouth of ſuch ſtream, to the fork or confluence of the rivers now called Tugaloo or Keowee, and from thence to the moſt northern branch or ſtream of the ſaid river Tugaloo, till it interſects the

                  <p>And Whereas until the formation of the confederation there could poſſibly belong no territorial rights to the United States, nor after ſuch formation within the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered limits of any ſtate, but ſuch as were ſpecially ceded and relinquiſhed by the reſpective ſtates; and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the ſtate of Geoagia have by no act of theirs, or in any manner or ſhape whatever, transferred or aliened or delegated a power to transfer or alien the territory at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to be diſpoſed of by the ſaid uſurped act paſſed on the ſeventh of January in the year one thouſand ſeven hundred and ninety-five, and the ſame and every part thereof is hereby declared to be veſted in the ſtate and people thereof, and inalienable, but by a convention cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the people for that expreſs purpoſe, or by ſome clauſe of power expreſſed by the people delegating ſuch expreſs power to the legiſlature in the conſtitution.</p>
                  <p>And whereas diveſted of all fundamental and conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional authority which the ſaid uſurped act might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by its advocates, and thoſe who claim under it, to be founded on, fraud has been practiſed to obtain it, and the grant under it. And it is a fundamental principle both of law and equity, that there cannot be a wrong without a remedy, and the ſtate and the citizens thereof have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a moſt grievous injury in the barter of their rights by the ſaid uſurped act and grants, and there is no court exiſting if the dignity of the ſtate would permit her entering one, for the trial of fraud and collu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of individuals, or to conteſt her ſovereignty with them, whereby the remedy for ſo notorious an injury could be obtained: and it can no where better lay than with the repreſentatives of the people choſen by them, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter due promulgation by the grand juries of moſt of the counties of the ſtate, of the means practiſed, and by the remonſtrances of the people to the convention, held on the tenth day of May, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ninety-five, ſetting forth the atrocious ſpeculation, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and colluſion, by which the ſaid uſurped act and grants were obtained.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="unknown:035588_0106_1005F83AFAFBD2B0"/>
And whereas the ſaid petitions and remonſtrances of the good people compoſing the ſtate, to the ſaid late conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion held at Louiſville on the ſaid tenth day of May, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ninety-five, produced a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of that body in the following words: "<hi>Reſolved,</hi> That it is the opinion of this convention, from the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, reſpectability, and ground of complaint ſtated in the ſundry petitions laid before them, that this is a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of importance meriting legiſlative deliberation. <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered therefore,</hi> That ſuch petitions be preſerved by the Secretary, and laid before the next legiſlature at their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing ſeſſion." Which reſolution inveſts this legiſlature with conventional powers, <hi>quo ad hoc,</hi> or in common terms, for the purpoſe of inveſtigating the ſame, and which gives additional validity to legiſlative authority, were the powers of one legiſlature over the acts of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be attempted to be queſtioned.</p>
                  <p>And whereas it does appear from ſundry affidavits and a variety of proofs ſatisfactory to this Legiſlature, as well as from the preſentments of the grand Juries on oath of a conſiderable majority of the counties of the ſtate, and by the afore-recited petitions and remenſtrances of the good people thereof to the Convention, and by numerous pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions to this preſent legiſlature to the ſame purport, as alſo from the ſelf evident proof of fraud, ariſing from the rejection of eight hundred thouſand dollars, and the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of five hundred thouſand dollars, as the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion money for which the ſaid territory was ſold; that fraud and corruption were practiſed to obtain the ſaid act and grants, and that a majority of thoſe members of the Legiſlature who voted in favor of the aforeſaid act, were engaged in the purchaſe; and a majority of one vote only appeared in favor of the ſaid uſurped act in the ſenate, and on which majority in that branch the ſame was paſſed, and corruption appears againſt more than one member of that body; which excluſive of the many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions uſed, and the inadequacy of price for ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe and valuable tract of country, would be ſufficient in equity, reaſon, and law, to invalidate the contract, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſuppoſing it to be conſtitutional, which this Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture declares it is not.</p>
                  <p>

               <p>Reſolved that it be, and hereby is, repreſented to the ſtates of North-Carolina and Georgia, that the lands which have been ceded by the other ſtates in compliance
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:035588_0110_1005F8441596B008"/>with the recommendations of this body, are now ſelling in large quantities for public ſecurities; that the deeds of ceſſion from the different ſtates have been made without annexing an expreſs condition that they ſhould not ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate till the other ſtates, under like circumſtances made ſimilar ceſſion; and that congreſs have ſuch faith in the juſtice and magnanimity of the ſtates of North-Carolina and Georgia, that they only think it neceſſary to call their attention to theſe circumſtances, not doubting but upon conſideration of the ſubject, they will feel thoſe obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which will induce ſimilar ceſſions, and juſtify that confidence which has been placed in them.</p>

               <p>THIRTY-TWO years have elapſed ſince all the country on the left, or eaſtern bank of the Miſſiſſippi, being under the legitimate dominion of the then king of England, that ſovereign thought proper to regulate with preciſion the limits between the provinces of Georgia and of the two Florida's, which was done by his ſolemn pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, publiſhed in the uſual form; by which he eſtabliſhed betweeen them preciſely the ſame limits, which nearly twenty years after he declared to be the ſouthernly limits of the United States by the treaty which this ſame king of England concluded with them in the month of November, 1762.—</p>

               <head>No. XVII. CASE.</head>
               <p>The legiſlature of the ſtate of Georgia by an act of the 7th January 1795, directed a ſale to be made of a certain
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:035588_0111_1005F848737EB958"/>tract of land, therein deſcribed to James Gunn, and others, by the name of the Georgia company; upon certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions therein ſpecified. The ſale was made purſuant to the act: the conditions of ſale were performed by the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſers, and a regular grant made to them accordingly of the ſaid tract of land. Subſequent thereto, the ſaid legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature has paſſed an act, whereby on the ſuggeſtion of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtitutionality for various reaſons (prout the act) and alſo of fraud and corruption in application to the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive body, the firſt act, and the grants thereupon; are declared null and void.</p>
               <p>On the foregoing caſe, the opinion of counſel is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, whether the title of the grantees and their aſſigns, the latter being <hi>bonafide,</hi> purchaſers of them for valuable conſiderations be valid; or whether the laſt mentioned act be of force to annul the grant?</p>
               <div type="answer">
                  <head>ANSWER.</head>
                  <p>Never having examined the title of the ſtate of Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia to the lands in queſtion, I have no knowledge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that ſtate was itſelf entitled to them and in capacity to make a valid grant. I can therefore have no opinion on this point.—But aſſuming it in the argument as a fact, that the ſtate of Georgia had at the time of the grant a good title to the land, I hold that the revocation of it is void, and that the grant is ſtill in force.</p>
                  <p>Without pretending to judge of the original merits or demerits of the purchaſers, it may be ſafely ſaid to be a contravention of the firſt principles of natural juſtice and ſocial policy, without any judicial deciſion of facts, by a poſitive act of legiſlature, to revoke a grant of property re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly made for valuable conſideration, under legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive authority, to the prejudice even of third perſons on every ſuppoſition innocent of the alledged fraud or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; and it may be added that the precedent is new of revoking a grant on the ſuggeſtion of corruption of a legiſlative body.—Nor do I perceive ſufficient ground for the ſuggeſtion of unconſtitutionality in the firſt act.</p>
                  <p>In addition to theſe general conſiderations, placing the revocation in a very unfavourable light, the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the United States, article firſt, ſection tenth declares that no ſtate ſhall paſs a law impairing the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of contract. This muſt be equivalent to ſaying
<pb n="109"
                         facs="unknown:035588_0112_1005F84A09EE6778"
                         rendition="simple:additions"/>no ſtate ſhall paſs a law revoking, invalidating, or altering a contract. Every grant from one to another, whether the grantor be a ſtate or an individual, is virtually a contract that the grantee ſhall hold and enjoy the thing granted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the grantor, and his repreſentatives. It therefore appears to me that taking the terms of the conſtitution, in their large ſenſe, and giving them effect according to the general ſpirit and policy of the proviſions: the Revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the grant by the act of the legiſlatiure of Georgia, may juſtly be conſidered as contrary to the conſtitution of the United States, and therefore null. And that the courts of the United States in caſes within their juriſdiction will be likely to pronounce it ſo.</p>
