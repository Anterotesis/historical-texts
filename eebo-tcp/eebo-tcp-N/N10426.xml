            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AS the Chriſtian Religion comes addreſſed to the reaſon and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of men, ſo the more we examine and conſider it, we ſhall find it to be one vaſt conſiſtent ſcheme, commencing almoſt as early as the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the world, and terminating on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the redemption of all mankind. INFIDELS who have neither temper nor abilities for inveſtigating the merits of Chriſtianity, may cavil at particular paſſages in ſacred hiſtory, and bring the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013219_0005_0F8FB6409FE36420"/>
charge of abſurdity againſt the <hi>whole.</hi>—RELIGIONISTS may urge the various tenets they have adopted, with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed and illiberal zeal; adducing each in ſupport of his opinion ſome texts of ſcripture—But men who have taken up their religion from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of their minds—from calmly revolving the evidence by which it is ſupported—as well as its conformity to the reaſon and fitneſs of things—are not to be ſhaken in their principles by the ſcoffs of unbelievers, or the bigotry of profeſſing chriſtians.</p>
            <p>As this therefore is the day on which the great founder of our religion deign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to become fleſh and dwell among us, I cannot more uſefully employ your time and my own than, in pointing out the harmony which ſubſiſts between the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013219_0006_0F8FB6412A6ABFD8"/>
Old and New Teſtaments in relation to the promiſed MESSIAH. And let me be permitted to hope that, as every in-individual is concerned to "know the certainty of thoſe things wherein he hath been inſtructed,"<note n="*" place="bottom">St. Luke, i. 4.</note> you will favour me with a ſerious attention, whilſt I endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, in as ſummary a way as the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject will admit of, to prove, that all things which were written in the law of Moſes, and in the Prophets, and in the Pſalms, concerning the Meſſiah, have had their literal completion in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>One of the brighteſt ornaments of this or of any other age,<note n="†" place="bottom">Lord Lyttleton.</note> after having himſelf written very excellently upon the character of St. Paul, hath taken upon him to affirm, that if every part of the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013219_0007_0F8FB643780C4440"/>
ſcriptures was loſt, ſave what related to this Apoſtle's converſion, he would undertake to prove the truth of the Chriſtian Religion from <hi>it</hi> alone. If then it ſhall appear that a ſeries of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, the laſt of them written near four hundred years before the events they pretend to foretel, at this time preſerved entire in the original Chaldee and Hebrew languages, and tranſlated into Greek by ſeventy interpreters two hundred and ſixty years before the birth of Chriſt, have all had their critical ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fillment in HIM; ſurely, ſuch demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble evidence muſt operate with all its force upon every ſincere and candid en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirer. And when we further conſider that prophane hiſtory, from its earlieſt dates, all along concurs with the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts left us by the ſacred writers, we
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013219_0008_0F8FB644396F56B0"/>
are compelled to exclaim with the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh High-Prieſt, though with a very different meaning, "what need have we of further witneſſes!" Many of the antient prophecies indeed are ſo ſtrong and pointed, that they ſeem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be an hiſtory of facts tranſacted during the lives of their authors, than the predictions of men inſpired with the knowledge of future events. Of this ſort is the prophecy of JACOB—who, at leaſt a thouſand years before the laſt deſtruction of Jeruſalem, ſo exactly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the aera of the Meſſiah's birth, that we may venture to ſay of it what the noble author already quoted ſaid of St. Paul's converſion, and reſt the proof of Chriſtianity upon this prophecy alone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:013219_0009_0F8FB644ECDDAC08"/>
But this will be conſidered in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per order. Previous to it, let us take notice of the promiſe made by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, immediately after the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of our firſt progenitors—"I will put enmity, ſaith God, between thee and the woman, and between thy ſeed and her ſeed, it ſhall bruize thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heel"<note n="§" place="bottom">Gen. iii. 15.</note>—Here opens the firſt ſcene of that grand dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, which was to be accompliſhed at Jeruſalem. No ſooner had Adam fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, than a deliverer was proclaimed—a deliverer, whoſe entrance into the world ſhould denote him to be the SEED OF THE WOMAN in a ſenſe in which no other ever was; metaphorically, "a root out of a dry ground."<note n="¶" place="bottom">Iſaiah liii. 2.</note> And ſuch was Jeſus. The ſon of a ſpotleſs
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013219_0010_0F8FB64602B61F50"/>
virgin, his errand into the world was to overthrow the combined powers of Sin and Satan, and to erect a pure king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of his own upon their ruins.</p>
            <p>FOR more than two thouſand years after the date of this promiſe, no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intimation was given of the Meſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, idolatry had ſpread itſelf almoſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally throughout the world, and even the memory of the creation ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be gradually wearing away. Amidſt this univerſal depravity, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God, "whoſe promiſes are yea and amen," to ratify the covenant made with our firſt parents, and to declare that in the family and line of ABRAHAM, "all the nations of the earth ſhould be bleſſed."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Gen. xviii. 18. xxii. 18. xxvi. 4.</note> And ſurely—if a deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the curſe of a violated com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013219_0011_0F8FB646837665F8"/>
a reſtoration to the favour of an offended God, and the extenſion of a kingdom founded in peace and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs are to be eſteemed bleſſings—theſe are what all the nations of the earth have enjoyed in the advent of that Jeſus, whoſe extraction from Abraham hath never yet been queſtioned.</p>
            <p>JACOB, the grandſon of this illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Patriarch, ſeems to have been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with a more than ordinary por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the prophetic ſpirit, by which he was enabled to foretel from what <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular tribe</hi> of his family the Meſſiah ſhould derive his pedigree. For on his death-bed, when he was drawing to the concluſion of a long and honorable pilgrimage, and his children were anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iouſly ſoliciting his bleſſing, he thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes himſelf to Judah—"Judah, thou
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013219_0012_0F8FB647280A9088"/>
art he whom thy brethren ſhall praiſe thy hand ſhall be in the neck of thine enemies, thy father's children ſhall bow down before thee. The ſcepter ſhall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until SHILOH come, and unto him ſhall the gathering of the people be."<note n="§" place="bottom">Gen. xlix. 8. 10.</note> In this moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable prophecy, we behold, as at one view, the hiſtory of the whole Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh nation. The privilege of primoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture is diſpenſed with, and Judah, the fourth ſon of Jacob, declared to be Lord over all his brethren—his enemies are to lick the duſt before him—and his <hi>ſcepter,</hi> or preheminence over the other tribes, is to remain, until that great perſonage, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically ſtiled SHILOH, ſhall appear—And appear he certainly did, in the reign of Auguſtus Caeſar, as will be ſeen in the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013219_0013_0F8FB64AF31B1D58"/>
application of this grand prophecy to JESUS who was born at Bethlehem.—</p>
            <p>THE firſt particular predicted of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah is, that he is <hi>the perſon whom his brethren ſhould praiſe</hi>—And it is one of the moſt ſingular circumſtances in hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, that, whilſt the ſeveral tribes were diſperſed by contending Monarchs, through various and diſtant kingdoms, and no longer ſubſiſted in their nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al capacity, the tribe of Judah alone preſerved, even in captivity, the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of being governed by its own laws and ordinances. To account for this ſtupendous occurrence from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of what are called natural cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, would be as weak as impious. We muſt look up to an higher ſource, to to the great FIRST CAUSE of all, whoſe wiſdom and goodneſs were
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013219_0014_0F8FB64BC6E30408"/>
concerned for the preſervation of the true religion, and whoſe om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence effected ſo wonderful an event.</p>
            <p>AND, that <hi>the hand</hi> of the deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant <hi>of Judah was in the neck of his enemies,</hi> let the miraculous eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt's religion declare. So rapid was its progreſs, that, within a ſingle century after the reſurrection, the ſound of the goſpel had literally gone forth into all lands, and there was not a nation in the then known world, in which it was not embraced by many. Philoſophy had previouſly exerted its whole force for the reformation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and was proved to be inſufficient. But no ſooner did the great Legiſlator of the Chriſtians enter upon his office,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013219_0015_0F8FB64C79BF2C30"/>
than the eſtabliſhments which men had combined and ſet up, fell proſtrate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him—ſuperſtition retired to her cell—and the kingdom of Satan trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to its center. Idolatry, which had ſo long maintained its empire, began gradually to decline—the boaſted Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phic oracles forbore to give reſponſes—and thouſands and ten thouſands were daily brought home to Jeſus.</p>
            <p>BUT enquire now, what is become of the tribe of Judah, and hiſtory will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you that, not long after the birth of Chriſt, it was ſtripped of all its privileges, and reduced to a ſtate of the moſt abject vaſſalage.

The fame of their arrival very early reached the ears of Herod, who, having given into the vulgar belief that the Meſſiah was to be a temporal Prince, became jealous for the ſafety of his own Crown—and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly having ſummoned the whole body of his Sanhedrim and demanded their opinion where Chriſt ſhould be

born—and having alſo privily enquired of the wiſe-men the particular time of the ſtar's appearance—he diſpatched them to Bethlehem, with orders to ſearch diligently for the young child, and to return with the earlieſt tidings—for the King wiſhes to lay his ſcepter at the feet of the illuſtrious babe, and to join in the adorations which are paid him!—"When lo, continues the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt, the ſtar which they had ſeen in the eaſt went before them, till it came and ſtood over where the young child was.—And when they were come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into the houſe, they ſaw the child with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his mother, and fell down and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped him—And when they had open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their treaſures, they preſented unto him gifts; gold, and frankincenſe, and myrrh.

a dream, that they ſhould not return to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.

            <p>But whilſt humanity ſhudders at the recital of this execrable tale, a very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful argument hence ariſes, in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of our holy religion.

whilſt any trace of hiſtory remains—and the motive which alone could have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigated to ſuch ſavage cruelty, muſt have great weight in eſtabliſhing the truth of Chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>WITHOUT wiſhing however to lay too much ſtreſs on any ſingle circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial proof, the poſitive evidences for the divinity of our religion crowd ſo faſt upon us in almoſt every page of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writings, that, to a candid mind it ſeems unaccountable, how it ſhould ever have entered into the heads of any to ſet up themſelves for Infidels by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.

Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently may we affirm, that the lawleſs ſurge would never have grown calm, nor the furious wind have abated at the command of a voice merely human, nor is it reaſonable to believe that any one leſs divinely commiſſioned than Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus would have been mad enough to have made the experiment.</p>

BUT my ſubject is PROPHECY, and I find I am inſenſibly entering upon a new field of argument. Here then—but that the time would fail me—I ſhould ſpeak at large of antient types and ſymbols—of the Paſchal Lamb ſlain at ſix in the evening, the hour when Jeſus gave up the Ghoſt—of the ſprinkling of the door-poſts with blood—of the brazen ſerpent erected in the wilderneſs—of Moſes, Iſaac, and Jonah—with many others ſtrongly fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gurative of Chirſt. His name, his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and his family—the minute circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his riding into Jeruſalem on an aſs and a colt the foal of an aſs—his being betrayed by the man in whom he truſted, and ſold for thirty pieces of ſilver—his having vinegar given him to drink—a bone of him not being bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013219_0036_0F8FB66341712BD0"/>
—the ſoldiers parting his raiment, and caſting lots upon his veſture—his making his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death—all theſe were minutely foretold, and tend not more to prove that Jeſus is the true Meſſiah, than to ſhew the goodneſs of God, in thus leading us, through an awful ſeries of prophecies, to a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which Angels behold with adorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but cannot fully comprehend.</p>
            <p>THE moſt important predictions, which refer to the time of the Meſſiah's Advent and the circumſtances of his nativity, have been ſpoken to: and ſo clearly were theſe pointed out by a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of prophets, that, as the antient Jews expected him at the time when he was really born; ſo our modern in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:013219_0037_0F8FB66354E6E038"/>
overpowered by a blaze of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, have thought proper to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his birth, whilſt they deny him to have been, what his miraculous works abundantly proclaimed him, the SON OF THE MOST HIGH GOD. Alas! was it ever well atteſted, that any one but Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and the few Apoſtles whom he dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to act in his name, unſtopped the deaf ear—reſtored the ſightleſs eye—unlooſed the ſpeechleſs tongue—and rouſed the dead from their eternal ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers—no—and the attempt to prove it tacitly implies, that the God of truth once gave his ſanction to an impoſtor.</p>
            <p>Look into the world immediately before the Chriſtian aera, and ſee it every where over-run with the moſt idolatrous and immoral practices, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytheiſm
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:013219_0038_0F8FB663AFB7C648"/>
openly countenanced, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge deified as a manly virtue. Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity lay hid in impenetrable darkneſs, nor could the moſt enlightened philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers ſay, but that when they reſigned their being, they were never to reſume it more. Look into it, ſhortly after our SAVIOR's entrance upon his public miniſtry, and behold idolatry almoſt every where aboliſhed, men no longer diſgracing their maker's image, by bowing to ſtocks and ſtones—the inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate work of their own hands—but calling upon the one true God, in places dedicated to his name, and forming their conduct upon a better ſystem than that of SOLON and LYCURGUS, or even of MOSES—a ſyſtem which, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of requiring an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth, inſtructs us,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:013219_0039_0F8FB66484E12D10"/>
"if our enemy hunger, to feed him; if he thirſt, to give him drink." By the preaching of Jeſus the future world became unfolded—life and immortality, judgment, heaven and hell—were brought to light, and the terms of our final happineſs and miſery fully made known. By <hi>his</hi> ſtripes we were healed—by <hi>his</hi> crucifixion, death loſt his ſting—by <hi>his</hi> reſurrection from the grave, he hath aſſured us of <hi>our</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection—by <hi>his</hi> aſcenſion into heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, he hath opened unto us the gate of everlaſting life—and by the effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt at Pentecoſt, he hath ſhewn us that he will be with all who call upon him in ſincerity to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>NUMBERLESS were the converts to this new religion, within a very ſhort

To what new ſubterfuge then, will the cavillers againſt the Chriſtian ſyſtem betake themſelves, in excuſe for their unnatural ſcepticiſm. Still to urge the ſame dull round of objections, which have been exploded as faſt as they have ariſen, argues as great a want of genius as of grace. The prophecies have all been proved over and over, by learned men, to be really of the dates they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume. They all point to a determinate period when a REDEEMER ſhould be born. They deſcribe his birth, his perſon, his character, his ſufferings, his death, his reſurrection, in language too plain to be miſtaken. The three Evangeliſts, who give us the account of the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe prophecies, were dead before the laſt deſtruction of Jeruſalem—ſo that their relation ſtands clear of the

            <p>THEY declare that, exactly at the time foretold, a BABE was born, in whom all the ſeemingly <hi>jarring</hi> prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies were reconciled—poor, and laid in a manger; and yet his nativity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed by an hoſt of Angels. The next account we have of him, after his return out of Egypt, which was alſo foretold, is his reaſoning with the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh doctors; where the Divinity of his youth diſcovered itſelf in "both hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them and aſking them queſtions," and aſtoniſhing them with the wiſdom
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:013219_0044_0F8FB66A97602568"/>
of his anſwers, and the penetration of his enquiries. When he comes to be baptiſed, the ſpirit of his Father deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended upon him, in an embodied form, and at the ſame inſtant a voice was heard out of Heaven—"This is my beloved ſon, in whom I am well pleaſed." And when he expired on the croſs, the rocks were rent—the graves were opened—the dead ſtalked forth—the earth ſhook—and the ſun veiled his orb in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural eclipſe. His life was one continued ſeries of benevolent miracles—his doctrines breathed nothing but the moſt pure and exalted morality—and whilſt his death evinced him to be the Son of Man, his reſurection loudly declared him to be the Son of God. More than ſeventeen hundred years have elapſed ſince the Holy City with
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:013219_0045_0F8FB66B7B7498A8"/>
its Temple was in ruins; and the vain attempt to rebuild them, in the fourth century, ſerved only to eſtabliſh more fully the credibility of Goſpel Hiſtory. The Jews ſtill continue diſperſed—the Meſſiah's banner is erected in almoſt every clime and nation—and, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that the converſion of countries is a ſlow and progreſſive work, the FULLNESS of the GENTILES is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly approaching.

THROUGH the whole of this diſcourſe, in order to give the ſubject a conſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, I have been obliged to ſuppoſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf addreſſing a people yet unſettled in the fundamental article of our faith, that Jeſus is the true Meſſiah. If there be any ſuch perſons in reality among us, let them ſeriouſly conſider the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of rejecting a religion, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by ſuch demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrable evidence as the Chriſtian—which an omniſcient God ſaw neceſſary to communicate—and which is ſo well adapted to all the exigencies of mankind. Doth it incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate one ſentiment, in the leaſt incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with either the natural or moral attributes of the great Being we adore?—Doth it preſcribe one doctrine or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, in the ſmalleſt degree unfriendly to human nature? So far otherwiſe,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:013219_0048_0F8FB66D74096170"/>
that it is a faith in which we may inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently live; and in which, ſhould it at laſt even prove an erroneous one, we need not be afraid to die. For the great deſign of it is, to give us the moſt rational and exalted ideas of God—to amend our hearts—to ſoften our diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions—to make us better parents, brothers, neighbors—to give a ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and reliſh to life—and, in a word, to enlarge the circle of our good offices as wide as that of humanity itſelf.</p>
            <p>As to you, my brethren, who have aſſumed the ſacred name of Chriſtians, let me exhort you, to be ſtudious not to bring a reproach upon your moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent religion, by the immorality and inhumanity of your lives. Let it never be in the power of an enemy to ſay,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:013219_0049_0F8FB66E2FAA9360"/>
that you profeſs a religion full of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature and civility, and that, dead to the ſpirit of it, your hearts are eſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to every tender ſentiment, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly inſenſible of the wants and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of your poor fellow-mortals, in theſe cold and pinching times.—Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is the ſweeteſt flower in the garland of Chriſtian virtues, and the man who hath never worn it at his breaſt, may bluſh to want the beſt characteriſtic of a diſciple of the merciful Jeſus—A diſciple of Jeſus!—alas! he is unworthy the image of humanity, who can reflect upon the calamities which this ſeaſon never fails to introduce, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging a wiſh to remove them.—</p>
            <p>I WOULD not be thought an advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate for the wandering beggar—and yet

of that ſort too, there muſt no doubt be ſome objects deſerving much chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table pity—But I would remind you, whilſt "your houſes are wainſcoted with cedar," and your boards groan with plenty, that there are many POOR FA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MILIES—ſome of which have once ſeen happier days—now drooping be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the complicated load of penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and diſeaſe, in the obſcure ſtreets of your city—having no ſhelter, but in your bounty, againſt the inclemencies which ſurround them—and who would receive with gratitude, even the crumbs of your luxurious tables—</p>
            <p>O YE who know what it is to make generous allowances for the infirmities of men like yourſelves, forgive theſe the pride—the modeſt pride—which

forbids them to unveil their neceſſities to every eye, and to ſolicit that mercy which they ſo much ſtand in need of—Spare a venerable FATHER of a FAMILY, the pain of relating the circumſtantial ſtory of his woe; how—croſſed in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry virtuous endeavor to ſecure a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence in the world—torn down by ſickneſs—melancholy with diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment—and ſhunned by the faithful friend in whom he truſted—Nature is at length giving way, and nothing now remains to him but to ſteal behind the ſcene, and leave the ſtage to more ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful characters.—O ſpare his bluſhes and his tears, and ſave a whole family from deſtruction, by ſtaying the ſingle prop on which all its hopes depend.

ſpirit—prevent even the aſking eye—and, if heaven hath allowed the means, enable him by your liberality, to riſe ſuperior to his misfortunes. The bleſſings of an ingenuous heart, thus ready to periſh, ſhall follow you through life; and your own reflections, at the cloſe of it, afford you a better conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than if you had ſpent whole years in attempts to unravel the myſteries of godlineſs, and in adjuſting thoſe modes and doctrines of faith, about which the ſentiments of men will differ ſo long as they are men.</p>
            <p>BUT would you ſee the reverſe of the medal, enter for a moment yon lowly habitation!—Behold there a WIDOW, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom <hi>the creditor hath come,</hi> weeping over her helpleſs offspring, and bemoan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the day when ſhe firſt became a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!

            <p>GOD, in mercy, viſit the hard heart which cannot melt at diſtreſs like this.—Fly to its relief, YE OPULENT and HAPPY ONES; and bear to be remind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whilſt you are rioting upon the bounties of Heaven, that many ſuch ſcenes, with others equally calamitous, preſent themſelves at this time, even in your hoſpitable city—</p>

Undoubtedly the VIRTUOUS POOR have the firſt claim to our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor; but, when a fellow-creature is ſtruggling with every ſpecies of wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, it is not a time to enquire, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his diſ-treſſes are the fruit of his own vices and indiſcretions, or whether they have been inflicted by the tyranny of others—'tis enough that he is a MAN, and that he needs our aſſiſtance.</p>

IT is my duty however to acquaint you, that it hath been judged neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to reſtrict our CHARITABLE FUND this year, ſolely to the uſes of the Poor of theſe congregations—a people daily increaſing in proportion with your own growth and that of the expences of life, and whoſe number upon your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion liſt is at this time more than dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble what it was ſeven years ago.—This being the caſe, I truſt no one will be offended at the hint, that, as a ſociety, we have yet to learn the art of regulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and providing for our Poor from the example of our neighbors.—Their good police, in this reſpect, hath attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the notice of foreigners, is quoted among ourſelves as a proverb, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly deſerves a general imitation.</p>

Perhaps too the DEIST—beholding the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent influence of your religion upon your conduct—may be won by it to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Jeſus as his Redeemer, after every argument had proved vain for his converſion.—But whether, or not, you will hereby diſcover the ſincerity of your profeſſions; and if men, by feeing your good works, will not be led to glorify your heavenly father—You will always have the conſcious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of your own hearts—peace will be your portion through this vale
