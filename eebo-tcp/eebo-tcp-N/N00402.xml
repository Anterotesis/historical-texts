            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Water-Baptism Plainly proved by SCRIPTURE to be a GOSPEL PRECEPT.</head>
            <p>BEing presented with a Paper, by a Friend of the Society of the People called Quakers, it being a leaf or two of a Book late written by <hi>George Keith</hi>: The principal Scope of the said Paper is comprehended in these particulars;
<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>That the Baptism with Water doth properly and only belong to</hi> Johns <hi>Ministry and Dispensation.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>That there is no Command from God for Water-Baptism.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>That the Apostles practised it only by permission for a time, as they did o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ceremonies of the Law, and not by any Gospel standing Commission.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:000498_0003_0FA6765A9BBB6550"/>This being the substance of the Paper, it is needless to mention every Line, I shall endeavour as the Lord shall assist me reply to these Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>The first of these being esteemed among these People as <hi>Goliah</hi> was in the Camp of the <hi>Philistims, I</hi> trust by the improving of a Sling and a few Stones chosen out of the Book of the Holy Scriptures to oppose and destroy, that a Gospel Ordinance be not by them defied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore contrary to this Conclusion, <hi>I</hi> do assert, That the Baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Believers in Jesus Christ with Water, is a part of Christs Baptism, began by <hi>John,</hi> but carried on by Christ; and to remain throughout the Gospel Dispensation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I do affirm, That the outward Form, and inward Power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness may not be separated, but remain and abide together in the Church of the Living God, the Pillar and Ground of Truth.</p>
            <p>First, For proof whereof, take notice of what is written by <hi>Mark,</hi> at the beginning, 1.2. and third <hi>verses,</hi> noting <hi>Johns</hi> Baptism to be the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ the Son of God: as it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, <hi>Behold I send my Messenger, that shall prepare thy way before thee</hi>: Here is plainly noted, That the Preaching and Baptizing by <hi>John,</hi> is a part of the Gospel Dispensation, and although it were acted under the Law, as also Christ was under the Law, yet his work related to Christs Gospel Dispensation, and is plainly distinguished from the Law and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, for it is written: <hi>The Law and the Prophtes were until John, but <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> the day of</hi> John <hi>the Baptist, the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take by Force</hi>; nor was Water-Baptism any otherwise <hi>Johns,</hi> then the Law of God was called <hi>Moses's</hi> Law, he being the M<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister thereof; and it was the Devils dispute, that the Law ended with <hi>Moses</hi>: So also was Christ the Minister of that part of Christs Gospel: nor is there any mention of a third dispensation, that is neither Law-nor Gospel of <hi>Johns,</hi> as is imagined; <hi>Paul</hi> treating of the Ministrati<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ons, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. treats only of two, Law and Gospel, Letter and Spirit: when one was to be chosen in the room of <hi>Judas,</hi> he must be one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the Baptism of <hi>John,</hi> so <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 10. begins the word of Peace by Jesus Christ at <hi>Johns</hi> Baptism.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>John</hi> is called Christs Messenger, the Message of <hi>John</hi> was his, and upon his account not <hi>Johns</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:000498_0004_0FA6765E85390558"/>3. <hi>John</hi> was sent to prepare Christs way, teaching believing in him that was to come; and as soon as Christ doth manifest himself, declareth him to be come: saying, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sins of the world.</hi> So that it is plain, That baptizing repenting Believers in Christ with Water, was then the way of Christ began and prepared by <hi>John.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Johns</hi> Preaching and Baptizing, was the way provided of God for them that believed and obeyed, to escape the wrath to come: for saith <hi>John</hi> to some coming to his Baptism: <hi>Who hath fore-warned you to flee from the wrath to come, Mat.</hi> 3.7 &amp; is agreeable with Christs words, <hi>Mark</hi> 16. <hi>He that believeth and is Baptized, shall be saved.</hi> Therefore it is said the Publicans iustified God being baptized of <hi>John,</hi> but the Pharisees and Lawyers rejected the counsel of God against themselves, being not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized of <hi>John,</hi> his work and Ministry being from Heaven.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Because Christ himself submits to it, as Gods righteous way suffer it to be; so saith he to <hi>John</hi> when he cometh to him to be baptized of him, <hi>for it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Because God bear witness to it from Heaven, both by voice, and giving the Holy Ghost to his Sons Obedience.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Because the Lord Jesus himself takes up with water-baptism, not only by obeying to it, but also dispensing the same with <hi>John</hi> in his day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and when it was told to <hi>John,</hi> that He, to whom he bear witness that was with him beyond <hi>Jordan, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him; John</hi> is so far from counting him therein an intruder into his work and Ministry, that he readily and joyfully confesseth, That, that work did of right belong to him, owning that he received his Commission from him, and was sent by him; saith he, <hi>a man can receive nothing except it be given him from above; but declareth him to be from above, and above all,</hi> John 3. <hi>He that is of the earth is earthly: therefore he must increase: but I a man of the earth must decrease</hi>; giving him the pre-heminence both in the work of baptizing, and in all other things: saying, <hi>after me cometh a man that is preferred before me, for he was before me; and of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace</hi>; and it is plain by Scripture, that the Lord Jesus took up this work, to carry it on, even of Water-baptism as i<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> said, <hi>John</hi> 4.1. when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that <hi>Jesus made and baptized more Disciples than</hi> John, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So that he

did it not in a corner, nor to a few, but out-went <hi>John</hi> in baptizing; but if it be replyed, that Jesus himself baptized not, but his Disciples, I answer, that makes no more against what I have said, than for any to say, that <hi>Solomon</hi> did not build the first Temple, nor <hi>Zerubbabel</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; which although they did not the servile Labour, yet all was by their Command, Commission and Authority; even so was the baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done by Christs Disciples, it was his work, and by his Power and Command; whose assistance went along with them as their Lord and Master, and that their baptizing was with Water, is plain: first, because it is compared to the work of <hi>John</hi>: So it is presented both to <hi>John</hi> and to the Pharisees. 2. Because it is said, Jesus himself baptized not, but his Disciples; had it been only the Spiritual part of Baptism, it could not have been so said, for baptizing with the Spirit, is only Christs' Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; yet is it said, Jesus made and baptized more Disciples than <hi>John,</hi> sure he did it not to <hi>John</hi> as his Baptism, for that were to make <hi>John</hi> Lord, and Jesus Servant, but they did it to him, and for him, as Lord of all, not as <hi>Johns</hi> first Testimony, that they should believe on him that was to come, but to him whom they witnessed was come; but true it is this their Command and Commission extended, but to the Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> as also <hi>Johns</hi> did, &amp; until they had received from their Lord more Power, and larger Commission were there limited.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Therefore when the Lord had finished the work of Redemption by his death, and was raised up from the Dead, and had all power given him in heaven and earth, he then inlargeth his Commission and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to his Disciples: saying, <hi>go into all the world, and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded, and lo I am with you always to the end of the world</hi>: he doth not tell them (as the simpleness and folly, or rather deceitfulness of the Quakers would carry it) well, I have now put an end to Water-baptism, which did properly and only belong to <hi>Johns</hi> Ministry and Dispensation, and now your work is to baptize onely with my Baptism of the Spirit all Nations; nor did his Disciples so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand his great Commission, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. to intend.</p>
            <p n="9">9. When the Disciples had received the promis<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d holy Spirit, that was to be their guide and order to inable them to be Christs Witnesses
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000498_0006_0FA6766280F481C0"/>
to the people in the power of this Spirit, they went forth, the Lord working with them and confirming his Word by signs following, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.20. But let it be minded, how did these chosen Apostles and Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples carry on this work of Christ; for now it is undeniable, that the Ministration of the Spirit is begun, and by the Holy Spirit, they are led it being poured on them to the admiration of all the dwellers on earth, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.5. See their work first at Jerusalem, how powerfully did the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit convince the <hi>Jews</hi> that had killed the Prince of Life, whom God raised up; so that upon hearing <hi>Peters</hi> testimony, not of killing the Light within, as the Quakers Preach, but of that holy Child Jesus, who was of the fruit of <hi>Davids</hi> Loyns according to the flesh, yet the only begotten Son of God, according to the Spirit of holiness, they were pricked in their hearts, and said to <hi>Peter,</hi> and the rest of the Apostles, <hi>Men and Brethren what shall we do? Peter guided by the Spirit,</hi> answereth: <hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you</hi> (mind it, every one that expects Salvation) <hi>in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall rece<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ve the gift of the Holy Ghost</hi>; this can be no otherwise taken then of Water-baptism, as to the first part, and spirit baptism in the second part, otherwise to render it only Spirit, as the Quakers suggest, is to charge the spirit of God in <hi>Peter</hi> with gross impertinencies and tautologies, as if he should say, Repent and be baptized with the holy spirit, and you shall receive the holy spirit: but the Spirits Teaching in it indeed is plain, that repenting Believers baptized with Water (being a sign and Token from God to them of the remission of sins) are the only true Heirs of the promise of the Holy Ghost, which God doth also give to them that obey him, and to look for this blessed promise otherwise than in his own way, is as to seek the living among the dead.</p>
            <p>So again, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. <hi>Philip</hi> the Evangelist led by the spirit of God, went down to the Cities of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and Preached Christ to them, to whom it is said, <hi>they with one accord gave heed, and believing they were baptized both Men and Women</hi>; and that this was Water baptism, is undeniable, because it is said after that: when <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John were</hi> sent from Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem to further that work of Christ even to put them in Gods orderly way, they prayed for them, <hi>That they might receive the Holy Ghost, for as yet he was fallen on none of them, only they were baptized in the name of

               <hi>Acts</hi> 9. saith <hi>Ananias</hi> to <hi>Saul,</hi> being sent of the Lord to him, the Lord having called him to believe; <hi>and now why tarriest thou, arise and be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, and wash away thy sins</hi>: that here was water-baptism as well as spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit-baptism, is evident, for though <hi>Ananias by</hi> Gods appointment put his hands on him, to the end he might receive his sight, and be filled with the holy Ghost, yet there was something for <hi>Saul</hi> to be active and passive in, to the will of Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> that had called him even to arise and be baptized which must needs be of Water, for as before hath been hinted in order to receiving the holy Ghost, it is only required to repent and be baptized; certain, <hi>Saul</hi> did repent, but he must also give up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self professedly to Jesus, whom he had persecuted, as well as other Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. So again, see <hi>Acts</hi> 16. this was <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> way to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Jaylor and his Houshold, and to <hi>Lydia</hi> and her Houshold; upon their believing: And now let me come to the <hi>Corinthians, Acts</hi> 18. there we find <hi>Crispas</hi> the Ruler of the Synagogue believing in the Lord, and many of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> hearing, believed and were baptized. I shall not need here to seek to prove this Baptism with Water, because the <hi>Quakers</hi> readily own it, supposing they have advantage against the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing with Water from this Scripture, for saith <hi>Keith,</hi> and it is usually coakt at by them: <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>I was not sent to baptize, but to preach the Gospel</hi>; and it was strange to think, that <hi>Paul</hi> would thank God that he did not so fully obey the Gospel Rule. <hi>Answ.</hi> first, if these should be put to prove this water-baptism, they would find it as difficult as for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to prove the Commission, <hi>Mat</hi> 28. to intend Water, it being in neither so expressed in so many words, and hereby we may see the shifts and devices they make every way for their own ends, to oppose Truth, but be it so, I shall grant this as the former and orderly way of Christ commanded by his Messengers; for otherwise how should these every where as appeareth where the Word is received, be found so obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

and yielding to it: the reason why <hi>Paul</hi> so saith, and thanketh God that he baptized no more of them, than <hi>Crispus,</hi> &amp; <hi>Gaius</hi> and the Houshold of <hi>Stephanas,</hi> was not, because it was not a Gospel Ordinance, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in <hi>Pauls</hi> commission, for then he had done evil in that he did in baptizing so many, &amp; of the first fruits to Christ there, &amp; persons of great eminency, and were after employed as Ministers in the Gospel as may be made appear to put them upon obedience to that Christ had not commanded; this <hi>Paul</hi> dared not to do as is aforesaid, nor can it be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably so considered; the ground of <hi>Pauls</hi> so saying, is clear, was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by the divisions Satan had drawn them into; to dote upon men whom Christ imployed; some one <hi>Paul,</hi> some one <hi>Apollo,</hi> others one <hi>Cephas,</hi> not considering that they were all of them by Profession Baptiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Christ Jesus; we are ready to idolize them that did baptize them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> upon this ground he thanks God that he baptized no more of them, lest they should dote on him, and give him the honour due to Christ; for saith he, <hi>Christ sent me not to Baptize, but to Preach the Gospel</hi>; with this word the <hi>Quakers,</hi> and many opposers of the way of Christ please their vain fancies, as if they had a clear word for their opposition to Water-baptism; but indeed that which is here inferred, is only this, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though baptizing was a Gospel command for every one that believed in the Lord Jesus, to submit unto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and so be planted thereby into the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his Death, Burial, and Resurrection, yet it was not so bound to <hi>Paul</hi> or any other, sent to Preach the Gospel, that they with their own hands must needs perform that work of baptizing; but another Disciple although not so indowed for Preaching, might be instrumental in that Service of baptizing, and therefore we find the Apostles had such and such for their Ministers, as <hi>John, Timothy</hi> and others; this is all that can be truly drawn from this of <hi>Paul,</hi> and makes nothing to the purpose for which it is produced;</p>
            <p>Christ having began his work by his Doctrine of Repentance, Faith, and Water baptism, goeth forward to compleat by his Spiritual Baptism, beautifying his Temple with gifts of his Spirit, this spiritual House of God was lively set forth by his material Temple, whose foundation was of stones, cut out of the Mountains, and also Timber-work; but the adorning of it, and finishing work, was of silver, gold, and precious

            <p>And indeed herein did the wisdom and love of Christ greatly appear to his Saints, fore-seeing the delusions and deceptions that would arise; and many subtle devises of Satan, to make void, and of none effect his sufferings for them in the flesh, to appoint such remembrances of him, and tokens of his love, to leave with them in the little time of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal absence, that his Redeemed should not be carried away with empty notions of false Christs that never dyed for them, to redeem them; nor with those voices, that should say, <hi>behold he is in the desart: or behold, he is in the secret Chambers,</hi> agreeing to this late voice of the <hi>Quakers</hi> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, who cry up only a light in the secret Chambers of the heart for the true Christ: but said he, believe them not, no, though they should shew great signs and wonders to confirm their word, for saith Christ, <hi>I</hi> have told you this before, <hi>that being forewarned, you may be fore-armed</hi>; not to wonder at those presumptuous assertions that false Apostles, and deceitful workers transformed as Angels of light should come forth with to deceive, but to look for the coming of the Son of Man, which should

so evident in his day to the whole world, even as the lightning that shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth from East to West; for saith he, <hi>so shall the coming of the Son of Man be</hi>: the Lord would not that his Redeemed should forget him, nor their Nature, that he took on him; and suffered in; <hi>for he took not on him the nature of Angels, but the seed of Abraham,</hi> Heb. 2.16. and saith <hi>Paul, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was raised from the dead, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Gospel</hi>: and least the delusion should be too much for these warnings, he declareth from heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
