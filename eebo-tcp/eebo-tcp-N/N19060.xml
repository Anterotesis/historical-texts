            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>IN conſidering my intended ſubjects, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar ſtyle of letter-writing appeared the moſt eligible; and particularly, when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected upon the abſurdity of uſing terms of art, in an addreſs to the ladies. The three firſt letters will not, I hope, be eſteemed fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to my purpoſe, as they ſeem to me alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether introductory to the deſign. I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to add the laſt letter, upon old age, in order to make the ſeries of letters complete; having now, in this collection, taken up man from the firſt period of his exiſtence, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried him through the various ſtages of life.</p>
            <p>It being much to our preſent purpoſe, and intimately connected with the following let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I ſhall tranſcribe a part of the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the eighth edition of the Family Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, publiſhed about twelve months ago.</p>
            <p>"Experience in phyſic is the wiſeſt path to tread; and conſidering what poor crazy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions too many of the human race unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily ſuſtain, and the various diſorders which even the moſt robuſt are liable to, no one can be too particular in remarking ſuch innocent remedies as may relieve ſlight indiſpoſitions, and conſequently prevent terrible and fatal diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:024796_0005_0FC88EDC99BE1298"/>"Good nurſing is a point which has either been too much neglected, or miſtaken; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs it is of the firſt conſequence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cure of diſeaſes, and the preſerving of delicate and feeble conſtitutions.

The average upon the laſt ten years.</p>
            <p>"Thus we ſee that almoſt two thirds of the children born in this metropolis and its envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons are entirely loſt to ſociety: 16283 are, upon the average, the annual births; 10145, the infant burials; and, what deſerves parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular attention, 7987 are cut off before they
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:024796_0006_0FC88EE2A62BBA80"/>are two years old, which is more than three fourths of thoſe children who die under five years of age. How ardently therefore is it to be wiſhed that ſuch a fatality could be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented!—It may be prevented.</p>
            <p>"Is it not affecting, that ſo many beings, juſt entering into life, ſhould be ſo untimely cut off, to the detriment of ſociety, and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of their weeping mothers? It is, tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a ſubject of commiſeration, a ſcene which draws a ſilent tear from the eye of humanity, and pierces the wounded boſoms of afflicted parents.—Above three fourths of theſe little innocents fall a ſacrifice under two years old. It is well known, that the thruſh and watery gripes generally terminate their exiſtence in the early months; and, if they ſurvive theſe maladies, the time of teething too frequently brings on the fatal cataſtrophe.</p>
            <p>"Could we but conquer the prejudices of the times, and aboliſh unnatural and abſurd practices—could we but reſtore that natural and ſimple method of rearing children, which the all-wiſe Giver of life has ſufficiently point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out—did we but confine them to that nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, which HE has prepared for their firſt ſtate of exiſtence—and conſult that reaſon which HE has beſtowed upon us, to conduct them forwards—all would be well. But, alas, indolence and luxury forbid the taſk! Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, to the rational few the following re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks are ſubmitted.</p>
            <p>"The thruſh and watery gripes are, in the
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:024796_0007_0FC88EE4E6D709F8"/>author's opinion, artificial diſeaſes, and both of them totally occaſioned by improper food; ſuch as, all kinds of pap, whether made from flour, bread, or biſcuit: they all cauſe too much fermentation in an infant's ſtomach, and irritate its tender bowels beyond what nature can ſupport. This appears to him to be the evident cauſe of the before-mentioned com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints.</p>
            <p>"When infants are paſt this period, the danger in cutting their teeth is juſtly to be feared. This difficulty proceeds altogether from a weakneſs of conſtitution, ariſing from the ſame firſt miſmanagement in point of diet: and here a train of dreadful ſymptoms preſent themſelves; the head, the ſtomach, the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, are all at times terribly affected; a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral waſting of the body frequently enſues; and unconquerable fevers prevail, which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally terminate in convulſions and death.</p>
            <p>"To prevent all theſe unhappy conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, let us but for a moment reflect that every mother is deſigned by nature to foſter her own child. If the breaſt is not to be obtained, cow's milk is in general to be preferred to any kind of food that can be invented, becauſe it is nearly ſimilar to that which nature intended."</p>
            <p>I ſincerely wiſh the hints thrown out in the following letters may be attended to; as the ſucceſs of rearing children, and the preſerving infirm and aged conſtitutions, greatly depends upon good nurſing; much more indeed than it does upon the application of medicines. For
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:024796_0008_0FC88EE66288A320"/>although, by the medical art, many violent and dangerous diſeaſes may oftentimes be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from proving fatal; yet, even when the doctor has taken his leave, the good nurſe muſt ſtill be watchful, "to reſtore again the invalid to a healthy and vigorous conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</p>
            <p>I was apprehenſive, that many objections would be ſtarted both againſt my opinions and maxims; which, indeed, was a leading mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for concealing my name in the firſt edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but as I hope I have ſpoken with can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, and as I mean to perſuade, rather than to find fault, it is to be wiſhed, that the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of the female ſex at leaſt, whom it more nearly concerns, will not receive this little preſent with ſuch unconquerable prejudices, as would probably have been experienced from their grand-dames. If, by addreſſing their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, I ſhould be happy enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince their judgment, of the propriety of the following obſervations, I truſt they may prove in ſome meaſure beneficial both to themſelves and their future daughters, in the exalted cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of wives and mothers.</p>
            <p>There is a certain reſpect due to our anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and their cuſtoms; and, for my own part, I would never embrace new maxims or opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but upon full conviction of their claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preference to old ones. Still it ſhould be remembered, the mind was never deſigned for a ſtate of ſlavery; therefore, when once our reaſon is truly convinced of former errors, let
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:024796_0009_0FC88EE8B893AC50"/>the ſanction for ſuch miſtakes be never ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtable, there is a glorious freedom inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in human nature, that prompts a generous mind to revoke erroneous opinions, and adopt thoſe ſyſtems, which, upon mature delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhall appear more rational. And when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the contrary diſpoſition is diſcovered, it altogether ſhows a want of candour, and points out an obſtinacy, not only culpable with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to our private characters, but deſerving of cenſure, as it regards ſociety; for ſuch a temper tends to prohibit every kind of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, that may either improve our own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, or benefit our fellow-creatures.</p>
            <p>All our knowledge with reſpect to infants, muſt be obtained from obſervation alone; as no one ever pretended to remember thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations and wants which he himſelf experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the earlieſt part of childhood; therefore a careful attendance is required in the nurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. When infants are properly managed, there is but ſeldom an occaſion for the help of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine: and ſhould it be neceſſary to call in aſſiſtance of this land, as they are totally inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of relating their diſtreſs, it requires an accurate obſervation, together with a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial account from the nurſes who attend upon them, to enable a medical practitioner to form a right judgment of their diſeaſes.</p>

Of Marks—the imaginary conſequences of frights and longings. A candid enquiry into the merits of this doctrine.</head>
            <p>PREJUDICES, which have been imbibed in our early days, received from thoſe we eſteem and reverence, and ſupported by the authority of paſt ages, muſt needs make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon the moſt candid and ingenuous minds; particularly when almoſt every day produces ſtrange and wonderful ſtories to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborate the ſuppoſed fact.</p>
            <p>The various blemiſhes frequently diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon children at the birth, have been gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conſidered as the effect of a fright, or a diſappointment of the mother's longings: and indeed this opinion has ſo far prevailed, that it has been, for a long time paſt, looked upon as inconteſtible. Should any one, therefore, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly dare to deny this amazing pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity in pregnant women, and the conſequent effect upon the embryo, he muſt expect no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than the general cenſures of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male world. Beſides, the many poſitive aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon this head, from the moſt ſenſible
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:024796_0011_0FC88EF270F75AC8"/>perſons of undoubted veracity, will naturally lead a prudent man to ſpeak with caution againſt the doctrine. Nevertheleſs, it ſurely cannot be improper to make a candid enquiry into ſo wonderful a phenomenon.</p>
            <p>It is a ſubject by far the moſt intereſting to the ladies: it comes, indeed, particularly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their cognizance; for the dreaded evil af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects the fair ſex much more eſſentially than it does ours. With my female friends, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I beg leave to diſcuſs this important point.</p>
            <p>It is by every one allowed, to the honour of this nation, (and let particular commendation be given to the daughters of Great-Britain themſelves), that in the education of young women, letters, and the polite improvements, are much more attended to in this age than formerly; accompliſhments which not only render their manners more engaging, but qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify them likewiſe for the happy domeſtic life; and contribute much to adorn theſe amiable and ſweetly-endearing companions of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial hour. How eſſentially neceſſary is ſuch a friend, to make life comfortable and happy!</p>
            <p>What a luſtre does every good and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed woman add to the matrimonial ſtate! —She muſt by every reaſonable man be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidred not only as the partner of his bed, but of his very ſoul.</p>
            <p>I can at this readily call to mind many ſuch exalted characters, to whom in a moſt particular manner I now addreſs myſelf.—
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:024796_0012_0FC88EF4070AB048"/>women, whoſe enlarged minds are capable of a much greater depth of reaſoning than theſe ſpeculations will afford; and in whoſe compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny I have oftentimes enjoyed the happineſs of friendly converſation—with whom, upon dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent occaſions, I have, in part, entered into the ſubject of this, and the following letters. It is, indeed, at the requeſt of ſeveral of theſe my worthy female friends, that I have been induced to collect my thoughts, in order to deliver them to the public.</p>
            <p>Ignorance, my fair readers, is the parent of credulity and ſuperſtition. Knowledge is the conqueror that triumphs over ſuch terrible foes. How much is the underſtanding enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and improved by the uſe of letters? When therefore we conſider that the art of printing was not diſcovered until the fifteenth century, and it was a long time after that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it became univerſal in Europe, we ſhall not greatly wonder at the bigotry and rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of manners in our anceſtors; and we ſhall ceaſe to reflect upon thoſe credolous times.</p>
            <p>To the ſcore of ignorance we are to place the many and hideous ſtories which have been formerly related of apparitions, goblins, and witches, that have at times infeſted different parts of Europe; and even in England have claimed the attention of civil and eccleſiaſtical power: inſtances of which are to be found in our hiſtory.</p>
            <p>At this period I believe there are but few who give credit to ſuch romances. The Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024796_0013_0FC88EF5916D0F40"/>and his cotemporaries pretty well clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the country of witches. As to ghoſts, the laſt that made its appearance was the notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Fanny of Cock-lane; and this arch ſpirit was effectually laid, as it is called, in a court of juſtice; where the gentlemen of the law carefully collected her aſhes, and, like alche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts, turned them into gold; ſo that there is no fear of any ſpirits riſing from her urn.</p>
            <p>We are now, my intelligent fair, fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the ridiculous fallacy of ſuch bug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bears; and at this time there is ſcarcely a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male but can enjoy, without one dreadful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, a cool and ſilent walk by moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light: a pleaſure their mothers could hardly be perſuaded to partake of; for, not longer than half a century ago, if a dauntleſs virgin had thus preſumptuouſly ventured, the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted parents would have been apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive for their daughter, leſt ſhe ſhould, ſome time or another, be puniſhed for ſuch impious audacity.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee prodigies and wonders daily vaniſhing, in proportion as literary know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the general improvement of the underſtanding, are cultivated.</p>
            <p>To ſome future ſeaſon, perhaps, we muſt poſtpone the elucidation of marks, the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed conſequences of frights and longings: yet, if this matter ſhould be a ſubject of diſpute with the ladies for the preſent, I doubt not that a little time and candid obſervation will commit the very idea of ſuch romantic opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024796_0014_0FC88EF998F43AB8"/>together with that of frights, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other ſuperſtitious error, to eternal obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion.</p>
            <p>A fright is generally believed to have the ſame unlucky effect upon pregnant women, as a diſappointment of their wiſhes will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. Hence they are perpetually racked be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween hope and fear, to the torment of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and every body about them; and are ſometimes ſo extravagant with regard to a wiſh or longings, as not to be ſatisfied but at an immenſe expenſe: for we have heard that theſe ſtrange cravings are not altogether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the palate; they ſometimes extend themſelves to equipage, jewels, dreſs, baubles, &amp;c. As a proof that ſuch chimerical notions even at this time prevail, the reader is deſired to attend to the following relation.</p>
            <p>Since the firſt edition of this work went to the preſs, the author happened to dine, in company with a pregnant lady totally free from prejudice, at the houſe of an intimate female friend, who has a heart truly good and ſympathetic. Her teeming viſitor took notice of a toy; it was a pigeon-houſe made of Staf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire ware, and in a baby-houſe would appear a proper ornament: yet the forebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of this good matron, leſt her friend ſhould have entertained a longing for it, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated ſo ſtrongly, that the kindly ordered it to be put into her viſitor's carriage. The preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant lady ſtrongly objected to it indeed, but to no purpoſe; inſomuch that ſhe was obliged to take the pigeon-houſe home.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:024796_0015_0FC88EFFB53F7C28"/>But not to dwell upon ſuch like particulars, which, nevertheleſs, have been frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced in ſupport of whimſical deſires, and which are continually magnified in the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, we ſhall confine our remarks to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral manner in which this magic operates.</p>
            <p>As I have univerſally been thought an infidel in matters of this kind, the ladies have treated me accordingly; nay, frequently, when I have begged quarter, it has been cruelly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied; which cautions me at this time to be modeſtly humble and diffident. I ſhall aſſert nothing; but by fair and impartial enquiry endeavour to ſearch out the truth.</p>
            <p>In conſequence of my ſuppoſed want of faith in theſe affairs, there is ſcarcely a female I am acquainted with, who does not treaſure up every ſurpriſing ſtory of this kind that ſhe hears, to tell it me with all the advantages that a perſuaſive tongue can give, in order to bring about my converſion.</p>
            <p>I verily believe, that, by the aſſiſtance of theſe my good friends, I could furniſh a large folio volume of ſuch hiſtories. It is a ſpacious field for the fancy to rove in. A variety of preternatural marks in living perſons may be produced every day: nor can the exiſtence of theſe extraordinary appearances be denied; for that is inconteſtible, as every one can vouch. The true cauſe of ſuch wonders, therefore, is the ſubject of our purſuit.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, I ſhall make bold to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, that I never met with one of theſe ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:024796_0016_0FC88F0099C01250"/>which altogether ſtruck my fancy with reſpect even to the imaginary likeneſs; or which, as to the ſuppoſed cauſe, engaged my rational confidence.</p>
            <p>I have been ſhowed a mark that was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the rhind of bacon, and told a ſtrange ſtory of the mother's longing for a gammon. I fancied it to be like the tinge of a mulatto, and congratulated the parents that the child was not altogether ſwarthy.</p>
            <p>A lady of my acquaintance has oftentimes declared that ſhe is marked with a perfect pig; but I never could obtain the ſight of this rarity, it not being conveniently ſituated for public inſpection. A little while ago, I was in company with her mother, an elderly woman, and quite a ſtout champion, as I found, for marks and blemiſhes, in conſequence of frights and longings. Upon a particular enquiry, it appeared that ſhe was unacquainted with the accident, until ſome conſiderable time after the birth; and then, from the appearance of the mark, ſhe very well remembered the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of it—which was this. When ſhe was very near her time, her huſband and ſelf were invited to the houſe of a relation, living at ſome diſtance, who, ſhe knew, had ſome very fine ſucking pigs. They both thought the ride would be too much for her; but ſhe recollects her having ſaid, that ſhe would go at all e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, if ſhe was ſure they would dreſs one of the pigs for dinner. However, the huſband went alone, and returned in the evening with
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024796_0017_0FC88F022DF06428"/>a quarter of a pig that had been dreſſed on purpoſe for their dinner, her relation know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe was fond of it. But alas! as her evil genius would have it, when ſhe ſat down to ſupper, ſhe could eat but very little; and at that time unluckily rubbed the part with her hand, where her daughter is marked, which, ſhe is very certain, occaſioned the form of a pig. I aſked her how the child could be mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſince ſhe had her deſire? No matter for that, anſwered ſhe: though I had the pig, the child to be ſure muſt be marked; becauſe I longed for it nice and hot, with good plum ſauce and gravy, but was obliged to eat it cold. We all laughed heartily at the concluſion, though, as the reader may judge, from differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent motives; but the old lady thought ſhe had obtained a complete victory.</p>
            <p>I have given this little hiſtory, to ſhow the abſurd manner in which theſe things are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally accounted for. It will be alſo proper in this place to remark the notorious diſſimilari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty between ſuch blemiſhes and their ſuppoſed originals. We are to take notice, likewiſe, of the eaſe with which the fancy is impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or impoſes on itſelf in ſuch caſes, even to infatuation; magnifying the moſt trifling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures into the ſtrongeſt confirmations. How often do women rack their minds, to find out the origin of theſe marks! which evidently proceeds from their averſion to be thought capable of producing an offspring with any imperfections; and their ſervants and nurſes,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:024796_0018_0FC88F03A5167DD8"/>conſidering it actually as their buſineſs, are always ready to help them out upon theſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</p>
            <p>Fruit, wine, boiled lobſters, freſh ſalmon, and ſuch like things of a red colour, are the moſt common marks; and there is ſcarcely a family in the kingdom, but ſome one or more of them can produce inſtances of this ſort.</p>
            <p>Theſe ſtrange effects, we are told, not only happen to the human race, but alſo, how wonderful to relate!—to brutes. There is a worthy family, whoſe veracity is not to be doubted, that are firmly perſuaded of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing fact; of which they were all ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. I ſhall deliver the account, as nearly as poſſible, in the lady's words, who favoured me with the relation.</p>
            <p>Her father's favourite cat happened to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a kitten, which, to the ſurpriſe of all the family, was marked upon the back with a rat. As the kitten grew, the rat increaſed likewiſe; till, at the end of ſome months, it dropped off the kitten, quite perfect in its form;—and the lady had it in her own hand. I was queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, very particularly, whether I could any longer doubt the conſequences of longing and frights, ſince it even extended to brutes—for, continued ſhe, what could be the cauſe of this, but the creature being diſappointed of ſome rat ſhe was purſuing?</p>
            <p>Thus cloſely preſſed, I begged her yet to pardon my want of belief. As to the cauſe, I was ſilent about it; that there was a ſubſtance
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:024796_0019_0FC88F08D7D53240"/>upon the kitten, which fell off, as related, I had no doubt.—What then could I doubt?— That their own imaginations deceived them.— How was that poſſible?—Much more ſo than they were aware of.—Where is the rat, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam?—Thrown away long ago.—That is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky; for, had I ſeen it, probably it might have ſtruck me as reſembling an owl, or ſome other thing altogether as extravagant. It was downright obſtinacy in me; for I would not believe any thing. I further ſaid, had it been a rat, I thought ſhe would have wanted cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to touch it—even ſuppoſing it to be dead; and had it been alive, it would certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have run away, and prevented her. This pleaſantry abated ſomewhat of the earneſtneſs of our argument; and a laugh made us very good friends—but I was an incredulous man.</p>
            <p>I have heard of a woman ſurpriſed in the ſtreet, when ſhe was very near her time, by a perſon with a withered arm: upon her return home, the fright threw her into labour, and ſhe was delivered of a child with a withered arm. How can we poſſibly believe ſuch an immediate effect as this to be produced?— Is it to be credited, that the mother's terror ſhould inſtantly blaſt the arm of the child, thus rendering it ſimilar to the object of horror?</p>
            <p>And if this be rejected, how can we allow the total loſs of a limb from a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> cauſe? —Could it be annihilated? This no one will aſſert. If not, ſuppoſing the effect to take place, and the arm of the keg ſhould be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024796_0020_0FC88F0C76F6DCA0"/>from the body, what becomes of it? Such divided part is never to be found upon theſe occaſions. On the contrary, where there is an addition to the form, proceeding alſo, as we are told, from fright; ſuch, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as a toe or finger extraordinary, an arm or a leg; in the name of wonder, from what ſource can thoſe exuberances be ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately produced? Is it not aſtoniſhing, that ſuch credulous infatuations ſhould thus beguile our reaſon?</p>
            <p>Not to trouble my fair readers with any more of theſe relations, which, by prejudiced perſons, are accounted undeniable, I ſhall juſt mention a few facts for the conſideration of the candid.</p>
            <p>A lady of my particular acquaintance, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of her pregnancy, was unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately overturned in a coach; by which acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, as ſhe endeavoured to get out, the firſt joint of her ſecond finger was entirely broken off. This was an alarming circumſtance to all her friends, and the dreadful apprehenſions of the child's being born a cripple diſturbed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one; but, to the great aſtoniſhment of her acquaintance, ſhe was delivered of a fine and perfect boy.</p>
            <p>An eminent practitioner relates a ſtory to this effect, which is equally to be credited, as happening under his own obſervation.</p>
            <p>A lady of quality being in convulſions, the family ſent for the doctor in great haſte. He found her upon the bed, extremely ill indeed.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:024796_0021_0FC88F0E26E569A8"/>When her ladyſhip came a little to herſelf, ſhe cried out, The black cat! the black cat! —her well-known particular averſion to this domeſtic animal ſeemed to point out the cauſe of the diſaſter, of which till now they were entirely ignorant; and the ſervants diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſearched for the object; when in a tub, placed to receive the rain-water near her lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's dreſſing-room window, poor puſs was diſcovered.</p>
            <p>This ſight ſo terribly affected the lady, that her fears were ever uppermoſt, and ſhe was miſerable until the time of her delivery. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could her friends pacify her, nor the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of ſo able a man bring her to reaſon. Notwithſtanding all they could ſay, ſhe was fully perſuaded her child's face would be like this black cat's. At length Lucina ſmiled pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious on its birth; and her ladyſhip's appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions vaniſhed, upon her being brought to bed of a lovely boy, without either mark or blemiſh.</p>
            <p>Juſt about the ſame time, it happened that the ſame gentleman delivered another perſon of a boy alſo. The child had a ſmall darkiſh ſpot upon the forehead. He was curious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to interrogate the mother about it, and ſhe moſt ingenuouſly declared, that ſhe was neither ſenſible of any fright or longing du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring; the whole time of her breeding.</p>
            <p>Had this blemiſh happened to the child of the noble parent, the doctor truly obſerves, the black cat would undoubtedly have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned a remarkable anecdote in the hiſtory of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:024796_0022_0FC88F1070A24588"/>her ladyſhip's houſe;—for by all her family and friends it would have been looked upon as an inconteſtible proof of theſe prodigies; and, give me leave to add, with much more ſeeming plauſibility, too, than the generality of theſe ſtories can boaſt; becauſe the lady had declared her apprehenſions at the time of the ſuppoſed injury.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here add another inſtance of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion altogether as fruitleſs, as that of the noble lady. It was made known to me, in conſequence of reading the above to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular friend, who immediately replied, that he was under great anxiety for his wife, upon account of her being terrified at the ſight of a perſon who had a very unhappy blemiſh on her face. The wife of this gentleman, by chance going to St. Paul's church, was placed in a ſtall exactly oppoſite to the unfortunate object, which affected her ſo much, that her devotion was entirely loſt; and ſhe talked of this poor woman continually after ſhe left the church.</p>
            <p>In a few weeks this lady went again to St. Paul's, and was unluckily placed oppoſite the ſame perſon; which ſo diſtreſſed her, that ſhe dared not to venture there any more. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this is as ſtriking an inſtance as we can ſuppoſe. I told my friend I was glad he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted me of it before his wife was brought to bed, and that I ſhould pay great attention to the conſequence; but at the ſame time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired he would endeavour to make both him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:024796_0023_0FC88F12A632FDE0"/>and wife very eaſy, aſſuring him, on the obſervation of myſelf and others, how little room there was to be under any diſmal appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion on this account. To finiſh the ſtory, his wife was ſoon after delivered of a fine and perfect child. Since which, this lady has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared her apprehenſions ſo terrified her, that ſhe dared not to look at the child, till ſhe col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the converſation of her attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, that the boy's face was free from ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh. What a cruel ſuſpenſe and painful ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance muſt this have been to a mother!</p>
            <p>Not long ago I was in the chamber of a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy newly delivered: her mother being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, took me to the window, and in great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs acquainted me the child had a large mark upon the right ſide of its face; that ſhe was terrified at the thoughts of breaking it to her daughter, and begged me to acquaint her of it. Accordingly, after congratulating the good lady in the ſtraw, upon her own health and a fine baby, in the courſe of converſation, I jocoſely told her that we were at a loſs to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for a pretty ſpot upon the child's face, and muſt deſire her to inform us of the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it. After a very minute recollection, ſhe frankly confeſſed ſhe did not remember any one thing that ſhe longed for during her pregnancy, neither could ſhe any how account for the accident.</p>
            <p>A variety of other circumſtances might be enumerated, to diſcredit, though many ſtories are related to confirm, this wonderful affair.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:024796_0024_0FC88F14D792C658"/>I ſhall not, however, introduce further parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, though divers have happened within my notice; but conclude this letter with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking, that in every inſtance before rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, where the misfortune of a blemiſh was apprehended, it did not happen; and in the other caſes, where marks appeared, they were entirely unexpected, and the cauſe of them totally unknown to the mothers; which, I may venture to ſay, has always been the caſe. If, therefore, women would wiſh to be cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dited in theſe ſtories of frights and longings, let them declare, before they are delivered, like the two ladies mentioned in this letter, that they have marked the child, and make known the cauſe of it. Nothing leſs can prove this fact; and, till then, even the poſſibility of it may very reaſonably be doubted; for ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we may conclude that ſo remarkable an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of ſympathy can never take place, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the immediate and moſt certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the mother.</p>

            <head>LETTER II.
Of Marks—ſhowing that ſuch blemiſhes may happen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependently of the mother's imagination.</head>
            <p>AS to longings, I doubt not but every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt have been ſenſible of ſuch inclinations. I can anſwer for myſelf, that, when indiſpoſed, and my ſtomach rather weak, I have many times ſuffered not a little, in being diſappointed of a thing that ſeemed particularly to ſtrike my fancy: ſurely I may be allowed to ſay, that the prejudices of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male education are likely to encourage ſuch inclinations to a much greater degree in preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant women, whoſe appetites are uſually weak and fanciful; and, as it is the caſe in every paſſion when too extravagantly indulged, I take it for granted, ladies may be ſometimes very much hurt by ſuch a diſappointment, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependently of ſuperſtitious, tormenting ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions.</p>
            <p>I would wiſh to arm every female breaſt with the reſolution neceſſary for her own hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Yet I do not deny but upon a thouſand occaſions the ladies ſuffer, unavoidably as it
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:024796_0026_0FC88F1C00301880"/>were, from fear; and materially ſo in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inſtance.</p>
            <p>Women, from the delicacy of their frame, and the particular mode of education in polite countries, are, without doubt, much more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dominion of fear than men, who are continually ſpurred on by cuſtom and vigour to exert their courage. This renders a variety of objects, although terrible to the fair ſex, ſo familiar to ours, that contempt alone is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a ſecurity againſt many ſuch horrible intruders.</p>
            <p>We confeſs, then, that women are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſubject to fear: it is alſo granted, that, in things they long for, they may be painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſappointed. It is not denied but that there are oftentimes very extraordinary appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces at the birth, which the fancy likens to a variety of things; but it does not therefore follow, that we are bound to believe ſuch marks or blemiſhes to be the effect of fright, or the conſequences of a parent's diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>In the firſt letter, we gave ſeveral relations on both ſides of the queſtion: I ſhall now beg leave to propoſe a few queries, which, if al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, in my opinion, ſeem in part to account for theſe extraordinary appearances; and what cannot be illuſtrated upon a rational en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, why may we not ſuppoſe to proceed from hidden, accidental cauſes in the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of nature? Since excreſcences upon trees, plants, and indeed blemiſhes on almoſt
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:024796_0027_0FC88F1DE46C0538"/>every kind of animals, (of which daily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience will convince a common obſerver), ſeem ſtrongly to authoriſe ſuch a conjecture; I ſay, why may we not ſuppoſe this to be the true reaſon, without the aſſiſtance of a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-working imagination?</p>
            <p>Will not an inflammation upon the eye fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently produce an univerſal redneſs over that part which otherwiſe appears beautifully white?</p>
            <p>What is the cauſe of this ſurpriſing altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</p>
            <p>Muſt not there ever have been a fluid circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating in thoſe tender veſſels?—And muſt not that fluid be neceſſarily limpid?</p>
            <p>Are not thoſe veſſels, therefore, unleſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured, too ſmall to admit the ſanguinary fluid in its compact and red ſtate?</p>
            <p>And does it not evidently appear, that they muſt be conſiderably diſtended, before the red blood can be admitted, which denotes this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation?</p>
            <p>Save where the virgin bluſh brings the blood into the cheek, or the roſy-coloured nymph rivals our courtly beauties;—does not the whiteneſs of the ſkin, in almoſt every part of the body, plainly ſhow that its veſſels equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny the admiſſion of this red fluid?</p>
            <p>We are told, by curious enquirers, that, for ſeveral months after conception, the embryo receives its ſupport from a lympid fluid, and that the form itſelf is nearly limpid, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourleſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:024796_0028_0FC88F20511F9738"/>If ſo, are not the veſſels of an unborn child, as it arrives nearer to the birth, gradually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, ſo as in the proper parts to give ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to this red ſanguinary fluid?</p>
            <p>May not therefore ſome accidental preſſure upon a pregnant woman—the violence of a ſudden jolt—or the ſhock received by a falſe ſtep or a fall, with a variety of other caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, convey ſuch an injury to the tender em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo, as upon ſome part of the ſkin to occaſion a ſimilar effect to that of the eye?</p>
            <p>Do we not oftentimes obſerve inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the eye to be in a manner habitual?</p>
            <p>Why may we not then ſuppoſe theſe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate veſſels, when thus diſtended, to be ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by the particles of the fluid which ruſh into them, as never more to be able to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their natural ſize?</p>
            <p>Hence theſe parts, and theſe parts only, giving admiſſion to the red blood—is it not probable that they may aſſume the various forms, which in various infants are imagined to reſemble ſo many different things?</p>
            <p>The cure of the before-mentioned inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of the eye frequently depends, not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on bleeding, but upon conſtringing the veſſels, and reſtoring them to their original ſtate, ſo that they again only admit their proper limpid fluids; and perhaps, if aſtringent applications were uſed at the birth, where a ſtrong preſſure could be made upon the particular part, many of theſe blemiſhes might in a great meaſure, if not altogether, be removed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:024796_0029_0FC88F219FEA9010"/>Such are our conjectures on the cauſe of thoſe marks which are totally of, or approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to, a red colour. But there are other ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes, which, at firſt ſight, my readers may take for granted cannot be accounted for by this way of reaſoning; ſuch, for inſtance, as appear to be of a light and dark brown, of a chocolate and black colour. Nevertheleſs, my fair friends, permit us candidly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
            <p>A blow ſometimes ſtains the ſkin yellow; if the part be much bruiſed, the tinge is deeper, and frequently turns quite black. A curious obſerved muſt have noticed, in thoſe perſons who from violent blows have received ſuch contuſions as are vulgarly called black eyes, that the ſkin, before it returns to its natural colour, aſſumes a great variety of different hues; all proceeding from the ſame firſt cauſe. Is it not then probable, that ſome ſuch accident happening to an unborn child, may produce a ſimilar effect? This perhaps will be allowed: but then why ſhould ſuch blemiſhes continue in children, ſince they uſually diſappear in the caſe before mentioned? However, to proceed in the enquiry: Such effects being admitted, their permanency then is the difficulty to be overcome. Let us conſider, that, although in mature life the conſtitution has generally ſtrength ſufficient to repel moſt accidents, not inſtantly mortal, yet in childhood, and old-age, the powers of the body are overcome by very ſlight injuries. In the meridian of life,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:024796_0030_0FC88F288C207A18"/>thoſe parts of the body, which are disfigured by accidents, moſt commonly recover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; nevertheleſs many inſtances are to be produced, even in adults, where the ſkin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues diſcoloured. Bruiſes and other injuries upon the ſhins, particularly in feeble conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, frequently occaſion marks that never diſappear. The ſame is likewiſe obſerved upon the legs of thoſe who are accuſtomed to ſit too near fire, in which caſe we ſay they have burnt their ſkins; and old ſores ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally leave ſuch marks. I have ſeen many of theſe laſting blemiſhes. My readers proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly recollect the fact, and alſo that ſuch inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red parts aſſume a variety of colours; black, red, brown, motley, &amp;c. much reſembling thoſe which are ſuppoſed to proceed from the force of imagination.</p>
            <p>Since, therefore, we find ſuch like appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances are ſometimes permanent in the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent periods of life, what can be ſaid to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove their continuance in infants, when ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to happen either before or at the time of delivery? For ſurely we may conclude, the more delicate the form is, it will prove the more ſuſceptible of injuries, and thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries will laſt the longer; the tender veſſels in ſuch caſes not being ſo able to recover themſelves. And as we often find it to be ſo in the feebleneſs of age, and in a variety of other inſtances—why may we not in the tender embryo alſo ſuppoſe theſe blemiſhes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to remain, and be durable?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:024796_0031_0FC88F2AE6D3B280"/>But if you think the above reaſoning not ſufficently plauſible, let us conſider the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of complexion in different perſons of this country—but principally the different colours of Europeans and Africans: and ſince we find appearances ſo diametrically oppoſite in the ſkins of perſons, why may not the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt in ſome meaſure take place in the ſkin of one and the ſame perſon, through a kind of error in nature from her intended ſcope?</p>
            <p>Nay, do not thoſe blemiſhes called frec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles, and more eſpecially moles, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently make their firſt appearance in advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced life, and are often covered with hairs—I ſay, do not theſe, with the common excreſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of warts, &amp;c. ſhow us how eaſily moſt of the different colours and appearances may be produced at any age? And though the cauſe of theſe is full as little known as the matter under preſent conſideration, was the effect ever deemed miraculous?</p>
            <p>Now is it to be wondered at, if theſe ſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of nature ſhould bear a reſemblance to ſome or other of the vaſt variety of objects in the animal or vegetable creation?</p>
            <p>Or in fact, if they bear no ſuch real reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance, cannot the imagination readily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they do; in like manner as, when look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the clouds, we eaſily deſcern men, horſes, trees, foreſts, flocks of ſheep, armies, and indeed every thing which the moſt fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful invention can form?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:024796_0032_0FC88F2C1EE9AA70"/>Some further rational conjectures might be added; but they would probably in this place be conſidered as too technical for the generali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my readers: I ſhall, therefore, wave them at preſent; for I think there has been already enough ſaid upon this ſubject, to check at leaſt, if not entirely to ſubdue, theſe reigning infatuations.</p>
            <p>Now if the doctrine of marks, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of frights and longings, ſhould prove to be nothing more than prejudice, ladies will avoid the continual diſtreſs which in theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance they labour under; for ſorry I am to ſay it, but at preſent it ſeems as faſhionable to cultivate ſuch diſpoſitions in young mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried women, as to recommend matrimony it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, ſuppoſing all that has been advanced ſhould prove to be chimerical; the removing of the apprehenſion, by which I mean the foreboding fears of the mother, will be to remove the greateſt part of the evil: and ſurely it is time enough at the birth to diſcern an imperfection. This, indeed, is a point which the ſtrongeſt advocates for the force of imagination muſt not only allow, but likewiſe approve of its tendency; ſince for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude is the only preventive, according to their favourite ſyſtem, againſt the miſerable conſequences of frights, and diſappointed longings: for if ſuch a degree of courage can be obtained, as will prevent fear, and ſuch a degree of reſolution maintained, as will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:024796_0033_0FC88F2D998946F8"/>the mind being hurt, upon any caſual diſappointment of the inclination, the evil it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is at once remedied; becauſe the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation will never painfully dwell either upon objects of diſguſt or inclination; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently blemiſhes can never happen from ſuch cauſes.</p>

            <head>LETTER III.
OF MISCARRIAGES.</head>
            <p>WE are now, my delicate fair ones, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering upon a ſubject which requires ſome circumſpection, to divide the province of the phyſician from the advice of a friend.</p>
            <p>There are undoubtedly conſtitutional er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, which oftentimes prevent women from becoming joyful mothers; and they may be hindered alſo by accidental circumſtances. Both theſe conſiderations, however, belong to the phyſician. In a word, therefore, theſe directions do not extend to ſuch remote cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; my counſels at preſent being deſigned to aſſiſt you in your own ſphere.</p>
            <p>The deſire of children is evidently predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in almoſt every female diſpoſition: it muſt be certainly owing to the wiſe ordination of Providence, that their education is ſo ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirably calculated to encourage this fondneſs. How engaging are the childiſh amuſements of a daughter!—Let us picture an innocent little girl fondly careſſing a waxen image, dreſſing
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:024796_0035_0FC88F36E6E4B9E0"/>and undreſſing it with all the pomp and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of a tender mother. What a delightful employment!—how amiable does the child herſelf appear!—and ſo endearing is this fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male province, that it is juſtly remarked to grow up with the ſex into life.</p>
            <p>I have, with inexpreſſible pleaſure, ſeen many young ladies, women grown, happily amuſing themſelves at their younger ſiſter's baby-houſe, and often diſcovered a crimſon bluſh, that genuine mark of female modeſty, ariſing from their being ſomewhat confuſed in ſuffering themſelves to be thus unexpectedly ſurpriſed.</p>
            <p>There are, indeed, ſome perſons who have declared an averſion to children. I have pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſuffered from the enumeration of the difficulties and inconveniences which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe parents to labour under, who have the care of a little family.—Selfiſh and unſocial conſiderations!</p>
            <p>God has univerſally manifeſted, that the whole human race are dependent upon one another; and thoſe perſons, who think and act thus narrowly, can neither be accounted good characters in themſelves, nor worthy members with reſpect to ſociety. But, alas! they are ſtrangers to the feelings of parental fondneſs.</p>
            <p>Certain I am, ye amiable wives, that, if it be your good fortune to become happy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, your children, thoſe dear pledges of love, if prudently educated, prove not only
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:024796_0036_0FC88F381DB243B0"/>an engaging comfort to yourſelves, but a great and laſting ſecurity for the affections of your huſbands. Truſt me, there is a time when the charms of beauty muſt ceaſe, and the paſſions of youth bend, to the majeſty of wiſdom:— 'tis then good-nature and good-ſenſe, with that eſſential ingredient, a cheerful diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will in a great meaſure ſecure your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; and a charming offspring will aſſuredly contribute to unite parents in the laſting bonds of friendſhip.</p>
            <p>How deſirable, therefore, are children! Even poverty itſelf does not prevent the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine wiſh for them. Let us then endeavour to promote their ſafe and happy increaſe.</p>
            <p>The difference of conſtitution in women is an important affair: there are ſome who upon every trifling occaſion are ſubject to miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages—others, again, who, in ſpite of the moſt direct and powerful means, are often compelled to bear the token of unwarrantable amours; and there are inſtances even of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried women, who, not ſuppoſing themſelves to be breeding, have been treated in the moſt likely manner to bring about an abortion—but all in vain. A remarkable ſtory of this kind occurs to my memory, which I relate from my own knowledge.</p>
            <p>An honeſt labouring man and his wife lived together many years without having children; and they were both beyond the meridian of life, when the poor woman was ſuppoſed to be afflicted with a dropſy. From time to time
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:024796_0037_0FC88F3A57CEF0B0"/>ſhe adviſed with ſeveral eminent phyſicians, who, from her appearance and the account ſhe gave, treated her as dropſical; adminiſtering the moſt powerful remedies againſt that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.</p>
            <p>At length ſhe grew ſo very big, that all hopes of a cure were given over, and the operation of tapping was recommended. The huſband's circumſtances being narrow, and the expenſe of this illneſs putting it out of his power to employ a ſurgeon, the poor woman was advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to go into the hoſpital: this, however, ſhe refuſed.</p>
            <p>A week or two after this, the huſband call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with a moſt joyful countenance, to inform me his wife was brought to bed, and that both the mother and child were likely to do well. I was at that time very young; but my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions upon the oddity of the event deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined me to be always wary in the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of dropſical female patients.</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee in this woman, and in a variety of other caſes, where impious efforts have been uſed to promote a miſcarriage, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in ſpite of great violence, ſometimes will not be interrupted.</p>
            <p>Let us then aim at aſſiſting her in this great work, where the conſtitution appears not able to go through with it; and point out the moſt rational means to prevent abortion.</p>
            <p>Our firſt letter, over and above the enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry concerning marks, longings, and frights, greatly tends to this material end. Women of
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:024796_0038_0FC88F429D089E00"/>a delicate form, and too great ſenſibility, are the moſt liable to miſcarry: ſuch alſo are the moſt likely to imbibe, and to be affected by, the prejudices we there wiſhed to caution them againſt. The power of fear is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly ſovereign over moſt perſons; and this, as it frequently occaſions miſcarriages, is tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be dreaded. If, therefore, the prejudices were diſcountenanced, the unhappy fear itſelf would aſſuredly ceaſe.</p>
            <p>And further, there is nothing tends more to render life happy, either to men or women, than to conquer, as much as poſſible, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of fear. This is the monſter, which in ſome degree ſubdues us all, and too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly makes mankind miſerable. There is no ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity but would eaſily become ſupportable, could we diveſt ourſelves of fear; and daily experience proves women to be moſt ſubject to its tortures. How many trifling inſects, that a man continually ſpurns from him, ruffle the breaſt of females, and throw them into the greateſt agonies!</p>
            <p>The evil, therefore, is ſeated in the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; for it is the dreadful apprehenſion of their own mind that torments them; which, by a firm and ſteady reſolution, may general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be overcome. Fortitude is an ineſtimable jewel.</p>
            <p>However difficult the taſk appears, the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt and ſtrongeſt prejudices may commonly be conquered. I am ſenſible, that ſometimes it will require great pains, and never can be
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:024796_0039_0FC88F44196EBE00"/>done but by the ſtrength of reaſon. Would you, my too ſuſceptible fair, follow my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice on this ſubject, a thouſand accidents might be avoided that hourly happen to you upon this, and many other occaſions.</p>
            <p>Reaſon was beſtowed upon us, both for the preſervation of our health, and the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our happineſs. The abuſe of it as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily deſtroys the one as the other.</p>
            <p>How do we continually reflect upon our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for inconveniencies, mental as well as corporeal, that ariſe from inconſiderateneſs and folly? Believe me, ladies, miſcarriages are frequently brought about by imprudence. When a wife has the pleaſing proſpect of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming a mother, it is no longer a time to be revelling in midnight aſſemblies. Such a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct not only deprives her of natural reſt, but alſo endangers her health, and thereby often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times promotes this dreaded evil.</p>
            <p>In this and every other point, I beg leave to caution you againſt falling into wide ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes. Some ladies I have ſeen madly run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning up and down, and jumbling all the town over in the moſt jolting hackney-coach that could be procured; and, although at the ſame time they complain of being ſhaken to pieces, yet this they ſay is to prevent the accident.— Others never ſtep out of doors, nay, nor ſo much as go up and down a pair of ſtairs, for ſeveral months: this alſo is to avoid the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>Again let me warn you of both extremes.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:024796_0040_0FC88F459A7452D8"/>Be this your guide—whatever exerciſe you are capable of taking without fatigue, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge—but no more. Never, in this point, regard the example of others. Becauſe your friend can do this and that, it is no reaſon you ſhould; and if the attempt gives pain, it ſhould certainly be avoided.</p>
            <p>I need not caution the preſent age againſt the pernicious cuſtom of lacing too tightly; for a laſs of fifteen, in the dreſs of our times, would in the laſt age have been ſuppoſed to be juſt at down-lying.</p>
            <p>I do not mean to condemn, but to praiſe the ladies for giving themſelves room in the waiſt: nevertheleſs extremes, you know, are not adviſed. There is a certain medium in every part of life, which is the <hi>je-ne-ſais-quoi</hi> that conſtitutes the agreeable.</p>
            <p>It is as uncommon now to ſee a young girl crooked, as it formerly was to ſee one perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtraight. I believe no one denies that their ſhapes were greatly injured by the ſtiffneſs of their ſtays, and by being laced ſo exceedingly cloſe. This pernicious cuſtom was frequently the cauſe of a bad ſtate of health, and threw many young women into conſumptions. We now rarely ſee ladies fainting in public places: but when they did not allow themſelves room to breathe, it happened every day.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is to be hoped the ladies will not again lace themſelves up, to diſplay fine ſhapes; the Author, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, wiſhes to warn them againſt ſo pernicious a faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion.</note> This
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:024796_0041_0FC88F471A599EE8"/>prudent alteration, therefore, ſo ſerviceable to maidens, is ſtill more neceſſary for married women.</p>
            <p>There is another caution at this time to be obſerved. I have frequently beheld, with pain, divers ladies too apt to be lifting and playing with heavy children: there are certain ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathetic emotions, altogether natural and laudable, which prompt them to it; and far be it from my thoughts to deprive them of ſo tender and generous a gratification: neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, to ſee a delicate little form, very near her time, ſtop a bouncing boy, and catch him in her arms, is really an alarming ſight: many miſcarriages happen from ſuch inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and, if our conjectures are not wrong, many blemiſhes alſo by theſe means are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably occaſioned.</p>
            <p>But there is a practice indiſcriminately uſed even to this day, worſe than all the reſt; and that is bleeding. Whether a woman be robuſt or weakly, if ſhe is pregnant, ſhe muſt be bled. Has ſhe any pains? No matter.—Is ſhe in health? Yes.—But ſhe muſt loſe blood.— Why? Becauſe ſhe is with child. Her mother always did it, and her grandmother, aye, and her great great grandmother too, time out of mind; and therefore can the propriety of it be doubted?—Theſe are the general argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments uſed by women in favour of bleeding, when they are in perfect health: but if any ſlight indiſpoſition happens, be it ever ſo fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to their particular ſituations, and which
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:024796_0042_0FC88F49DE96B810"/>perhaps at another time would paſs unnoticed, dreadful conſequences are apprehended, if they are not bled: nay, indeed, thoſe little temporary inconveniencies which generally and unavoidably attend advanced pregnancy, in their miſtaken opinions, call aloud for bleeding.</p>
            <p>In our two former letters, we took notice of the difficulty that attends rooting out fixed and prevailing prejudices; and I am appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive that this is as deeply ſeated in the minds of women, as thoſe of which we there treated. However, let us aſk the aſſiſtance of reaſon alſo in this particular, and ſearch a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle into the merits of the cuſtom.</p>
            <p>Is not the infant ſupported by the mother?</p>
            <p>When there are two to be ſupported, is not more nouriſhment required than for one of them only?</p>
            <p>Is this then a time, without a real neceſſity, to ſport with the blood of a weakly and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate woman? No, ſurely.</p>
            <p>Let me therefore beg of you, my ingenuous friends, to conſider this matter in a rational light. I have given a plain and eaſy clue to purſue the enquiry; and the ſubject will not permit me to enter more fully into it with my fair readers, without aſſuming the character of the phyſician, and without advancing thoſe things, which may, in this collection of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, be conſidered as an affront to delicacy.</p>
            <p>To your own thoughts then I commit it; and will conclude this letter with ſaying, that,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:024796_0043_0FC88F5010F69B08"/>though I do not deny but there are caſes which require bleeding, yet I caution you againſt doing it at random, and, indeed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out very good advice: at the ſame time, I firmly believe ſuch inſtances rarely happen to thoſe who are not of a robuſt conſtitution, and am fully perſuaded that many women are daily injured by this wrong practice.</p>

            <head>LETTER IV.
Mothers milk—the natural and beſt food for infants.</head>
            <p>I HAVE endeavoured to ſet forth the ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culouſneſs of women terrifying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and every body about them, during their pregnancy, with evils that moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly are altogether imaginary. I would wiſh my female readers to conſider this ſubject in a more extenſive view, and to aim at greater fortitude than the ſex can generally boaſt, in the common occurrences of life; when the tenderneſs of men is not ſo much engaged, and when the ladies cannot reaſonably expect ſuch kind allowances as are made at this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular time. Think me not ſevere; a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful monitor muſt ſpeak with freedom; the man who is blind to this foible, muſt be inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to your charms, and unworthy of your confidence. Your happineſs is at ſtake, much more ſo than a ſuperficial obſerver may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. Female vivacity ſoftens the rugged paths of life; and, believe me, ſelf-love operates powerfully even upon the moſt generous
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:024796_0045_0FC88F532858D3B0"/>minds. The woman who indulges gloomy ideas—who is continually brooding over me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy—who, in her hours of domeſtic re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, is perpetually rendering herſelf mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, and her moſt intimate acquaintance, and deareſt relatives, unhappy—ſuch a miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken SHE muſt only expect the cold eye of pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. However powerful her perſonal attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhe will ultimately baniſh her huſband and her friends. It will be found her greateſt misfortune, and at a time too when it is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trievable, to have once had the merit to gain, <hi>perhaps,</hi> a valuable heart, when ſhe has not diſcretion enough to keep it.—The impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the ſubject will, I hope, apologize for this digreſſion.</p>
            <p>We have alſo earneſtly laboured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the prejudices concerning marks, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of frights and longings; and have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the fabulous hiſtories of thoſe wonders. We have likewiſe ſhown how the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing may be deceived by the forms of fancy; and have no leſs earneſtly endeavoured to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plode the miſtaken cuſtom of bleeding indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminately, during pregnancy—pointing out, upon rational principles, the abſurdity of all. A taſk equally arduous in every part; a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand prejudices being imbibed againſt the whole.</p>
            <p>Another ſubject at this time preſents itſelf to view—I mean that of women ſuckling their own children; againſt which the preſent ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately received opinions are ſtill more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:024796_0046_0FC88F5561C877D0"/>than the former; as nothing but a ſtrange perverſion of human nature could firſt deprive children of their mother's milk. Give me leave therefore to obſerve, that milk is the natural ſupport which the great Author of our being has provided for our infant ſtate; and I am heartily ſorry the preſent manner of bringing up children puts me, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, under the neceſſity of proving milk to be the beſt food that can be given them.</p>
            <p>Milk is a nouriſhment produced from the various kinds of food taken in by the mother. Her ſtomach breaks and digeſts the aliment, which, after various operations of nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſo far animalized as to be a kind of white blood; from whence animal bodies at all times receive their conſtant ſupport and recruit. This therefore being admitted—un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til an infant's powers are ſufficiently ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to perform ſo great a buſineſs as that of digeſtion, the mother, by the all-wiſe appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Providence, from her own breaſt ſupplies it with the means of life. Hence no other nouriſhment appears ſo proper for a new-born child.</p>
            <p>For the farther information and ſatisfaction of my female readers, and to convince them that milk is the moſt proper nouriſhment for tender infants, I think it will not be improper to give a conciſe account of the manner in which grown perſons receive their conſtant recruit and ſupport from their daily food.</p>
            <p>Whether it be animal or vegetable diet, or
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:024796_0047_0FC88F59297E44C8"/>a mixture of both, taken into the ſtomach, the quality of the food is ſo far altered by the digeſtive faculties that a milky nutriment is produced from it <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>paſſes through the bowels, the milk is taken up by a great number of fine veſſels, which, from their deſtined office, are called the milky veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels; and through them it is conveyed into the blood for our ſupport: and, as before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, nature has ſo admirably contrived the animal fabric, that mothers are likewiſe ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to ſupport their young from this conſtant ſupply, which at the ſame time alſo affords to themſelves their own proper nouriſhment.</p>
            <p>This is the grand ſcheme of nutriment: for, when theſe particles of our food, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us ſuſtenance, are thus taken up by the milky veſſels, the groſſer parts are, by the ſame wonderful conſtruction of the bowels, rejected and evacuated, in a manner well known to every one.</p>
            <p>Whoever, therefore, gives this argument a rational conſideration, will, I truſt, be led to acknowledge milk to be not only the natural, but the beſt and moſt ſtrengthening nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that infants can poſſibly receive; becauſe their digeſtive faculties are, at this time, inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of producing a good and proper milky nutriment from any kind of food which can be given to them.</p>
            <p>The Author of Nature has univerſally com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the ſupport of infants, and the early part of children's education, to women; if it
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:024796_0048_0FC88F5B599894F0"/>were not thus ordained, he would undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly have furniſhed men alſo with milk for the nouriſhment of their young; and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence convinces us, that women are much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter qualified both by nature and cuſtom for this important concern. This ſyſtem of nurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, therefore, is peculiarly addreſſed to the fair ſex, who are moſt intereſted in it, and who will moſt ſenſibly feel the happy or miſerable effects of the manner in which they diſcharge this firſt great truſt which is repoſed in them. — Here, indeed, a mother will aſſuredly reap the happy fruits of fortitude, and thoſe likewiſe of a lively, cheerful and obliging diſpoſition. This ſubject will be treated at large in the twelfth letter; nevertheleſs, give me leave to obſerve, in this place, that ſuch as the mother is, generally ſpeaking, ſuch will be the firſt, and moſt probably the moſt dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble impreſſions received by the child. It there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore naturally follows, that infants, whoſe minds are early accuſtomed to agreeable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and whoſe expanding ideas are gratified with pleaſing ſenſations, unabated by flaviſh fears—ſuch, and ſuch only, as they <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> into life, will poſſeſs that generous gratitude, which prompts them to conſider it as a firſt great duty to contribute to the happineſs of their parents.</p>
            <p>I am exceedingly offended, whenever I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a child, grown to man or woman's eſtate, who ſhows, upon any occaſion, a want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect or duty to its parents; and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:024796_0049_0FC88F5D97D66AC0"/>ſo, if ſuch ſlight or contempt be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed towards a good mother. Unnatural monſter! to be wanting in reſpect to her who bore him in her womb—who cheriſhed and ſupported him with her milk—and for many years after his birth gave up her own pleaſures and recreations entirely for his ſake—and who had no cares but for his welfare. I would have a mark ſet upon the forehead of ſuch a barbarous ſavage; and he ſhould be hunted from the ſociety of men.</p>
            <p>Thoſe mothers, who by a fooliſh indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence ſpoil their children's tempers and diſpoſitions, are undoubtedly culpable; but the example of a violent, paſſionate, yet negligent and inſenſible father, is equally or more to be dreaded. A mother has this plea, that ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours at leaſt at the time to make her child happy; and it may be ſaid, in excuſe for her conduct, that ſhe is to be pitied in not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing better: but there is no excuſe, either to God or man, that can be urged to mitigate the vice and folly of ſuch a father: the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity reſteth with himſelf alone; for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent Author of our being is not to be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned upon this or any other occaſion.</p>
            <p>How provident is nature in all her works! How wonderfully indulgent to man, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther helpleſs animals, in their firſt ſtate of exiſtence, by thus enabling the mother to feed her young with nouriſhment drawn from her own body, until ſuch time as the offspring has obtained ſtrength ſufficient to provide for it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf!
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:024796_0050_0FC88F600FCCFBA0"/>This gracious bounty is abuſed only by man, the moſt intelligent of earthly beings; whoſe miſuſe of reaſon leads him aſtray, whilſt humble inſtinct directs all other parts of the creation aright.</p>
            <p>If we look around us, we ſhall find every animal that gives ſuck, carefully foſtering her young: and other enjoyments are no more thought of, until they are capable of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for themſelves. An example by which mankind might profit much: but the ſtrong impulſe of paſſion, in this and many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſubdues our reaſon. Did we conſider the benefit of our children more, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of our ſelfiſh inclinations leſs, the race of man would be more healthy, ſtrong, and vigorous, than we can at preſent boaſt. But, alas! ſuch is the depravity of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that it would be in vain to enlarge upon this topic of complaint; it is therefore our preſent buſineſs to prevent, as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the future growth of theſe evils.</p>
            <p>Let us, my friends, as you are all intereſted in the enquiry, compare the ſucceſs of mankind with that of the other animals in rearing their young. A little obſervation will convince us, that greater numbers of the human race are loſt in their infancy, than of any other ſpecies; for near one half the deaths, within our bills of mortality, happen to children under five years of age. And further, compare the opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent with the ruſtic, the ſucceſs is ſtill exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly different. How many children of the
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:024796_0051_0FC88F6161CB1B98"/>great fall victims to prevailing cuſtoms, the effects of riches! How many of the poor are ſaved by wanting theſe luxuries!</p>
            <p>Again, compare the ſucceſs of ſuch as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle their own offspring, with that of thoſe who commit them to the care of nurſes, or bring them up by hand; and we ſhall there likewiſe find an amazing difference: but more of this hereafter.</p>
            <p>From theſe conſiderations, it is evident, that Nature is always preferable to art; whence the brute creation ſucceed better than the human, in preſerving their own ſpecies. And the peaſant, whom neceſſity compels to follow nature, is, in this reſpect, happier than his lord. Thoſe mothers alſo, who, in ſpite of cuſtom, pride, or indolence, will take their little babies to their breaſt, muſt have more comfort and ſucceſs, than thoſe who cruelly conſign them to the care of foſter nurſes; thereby denying them that food, which is not only the moſt proper, but is ordained like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for their infant ſtate.</p>
            <p>Let me then intreat thoſe who are deſirous of rearing their children, not to rob them of their natural breaſt. Would they wiſh them to be healthy and beautiful, let ſuch mothers give ſuck: for even wet nurſes, we ſhall find, are very little to be depended upon.</p>

Arguments in favour of ſuckling—as well for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's ſake, as the child's—and the evils to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended in delivering children to the care of foſter nurſes.</head>
            <p>HEALTH and beauty are deſirable, and the latter in particular, to women. They muſt, in this caſe, be united; as it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a woman to be truly beautiful who wants health. Diſeaſe blights the roſy bloom upon the cheek, turns the delicate whiteneſs of the ſkin into a ſallow hue, and deſtroys the enchanting luſtre of the eye. How inſufficient is it for a lovely maid to make a conqueſt, if ſhe cannot keep it, as a wife!</p>
            <p>It is not at preſent my province to enlarge upon the accompliſhments of the mind. How neceſſary they are to ſecure the affections of a huſband, every prudent woman knows: and ſhe muſt be equally ſenſible, that the elegance of her perſon is alſo to be regarded; an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which thoſe who are in a bad ſtate of health have ſcarcely ſpirits to attend to: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, illneſs too often renders the ſweeteſt diſpoſitions croſs and peeviſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:024796_0053_0FC88F65DB2A21D0"/>Thoſe who are happy enough to have chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, run the greateſt riſk, not only of loſing them, but of deſtroying their own health and beauty, by repelling their milk immediately after delivery. It never can be done without producing a fever. Oftentimes tumours, and cancers in the breaſt, owe their origin to this pernicious cuſtom; aſthmatical complaints, and lingering diſeaſes, are frequently occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by it; and too commonly, the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate death of the mother follows from ſuch ill management.</p>
            <p>Conſider, my fair pupils, for your own health's ſake, and for the ſake of your future happineſs, how neceſſary it is to preſerve ſuch dear pledges of mutual love. By theſe power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ties, many a man, in ſpite of impetuous paſſions, is compelled to continue the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, kind, indulgent, tender huſband. Did you but thoroughly know the ſecret impulſes of the human heart, you would not riſk the loſs of your children, by unnaturally denying them the means of life.</p>
            <p>Let not the miſtaken huſband inſinuate, that you will be leſs charming in his ſight, by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your duty to your little ones: many— many inſtances have I known, of weakly and delicate women, who, at my particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, have ſuckled their children, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by obtained a much better ſtate of health; nay, they have been more pleaſing in their perſons, after thus becoming happy mothers; and their huſbands have, with pleaſure, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged their improved charms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:024796_0054_0FC88F6E560947F8"/>There may be ſome caſes in which it is not prudent for a mother to give ſuck; but theſe inſtances very rarely happen: and there may be ſome women, who, although they are ever ſo deſirous, cannot ſuckle; this, however, is but ſeldom to be urged. I ſincerely ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſe with thoſe unfortunate ladies, who are thus deprived of a happineſs, only known to thoſe who enjoy it. What ſhall we ſay under theſe neceſſitous circumſtances? Shall we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe ſuch mothers to employ a wet-nurſe; or to bring their children up under their own management, according to proper rules which ſhall be laid down in a following letter? They are both, in my opinion, wretched neceſſities. Yet, was an infant of my own thus unhappily ſituated, without heſitation I would prefer the latter; for much is to be apprehended from a child's ſucking a ſtrange woman: nothing leſs than abſolute neceſſity would make me comply with it.</p>
            <p>Too often diſeaſes, and thoſe of the worſt kind, are imbibed from the breaſt. It is a ſhocking truth, but vicious inconſtancy is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo univerſal, even among the lower rank of people, that many women offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and are daily employed as wet-nurſes, who are labouring under dreadful and infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious diſeaſes. Yet, ſuppoſing you can arrive at a ſatisfactory aſſurance in this point, there is a certain cleanſing quality in the milk of a woman immediately after child-bearing, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly neceſſary for the new-born babe, in
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:024796_0055_0FC88F6F99AC3C30"/>order to prepare its ſtomach and bowels for future food: this you very rarely can obtain from a wet-nurſe.</p>
            <p>There is yet a further evil to be dreaded: as it is through neceſſity alone that a woman will deſert her own infant, and take another to her breaſt, ſhe may be induced, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage ſhe gains, to conceal her being again with child, and continue to ſuckle the infant, till it pines away and dies, for want of proper nouriſhment. Thouſands have been ſacrificed by theſe means. Should they, however, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, in either caſe they are, too generally, miſerable beings: for, in conſequence of the firſt, diſeaſes of the glands, known by the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar name of the king's evil, and other terrible complaints, ſucceed; and in the latter, the rickets, watery gripes, and many other mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, proceeding from a weakly and relaxed habit of body, moſt commonly enſue.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, diſeaſe and death are the uſual conſequences of the preſent erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous method of bringing children up by hand. Scarcely one in four of theſe little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocents live to get over the cutting of their teeth; and the vitiated blood of thoſe that eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, occaſioned by improper nouriſhment, generally renders them infirm, or ſhort-lived. Almoſt every complaint to which children are ſubject, appears to me to proceed originally from an improper management of them; for the young of all other animals are full of health and vigour.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:024796_0056_0FC88F712242DBD8"/>And moreover, independently of theſe mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, the future happineſs of the parent herſelf is greatly intereſted in this maternal concern; as it generally falls out, that thoſe children who are neglected by their mothers during their infant years, forget all duty and affection towards them, when ſuch mothers are in the decline of life; and this contempt from a child is nothing leſs than plunging a dagger into the breaſt of its parent: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the cruel pangs which ſhe muſt unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably experience from this want of duty, daily obſervation convinces us, that widows fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſuffer not a little, even in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conveniencies of life, by the means of thoſe very children, who, if properly educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, would have probably become their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and comfort.</p>
            <p>Such are the melancholy proſpects attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſent unnatural practice of wet and dry nurſing; from which a curſe is oftentimes entailed upon a generation, of which parents ought to eſteem themſelves the authors. How terrible ſoever theſe things appear, I eſteem it my duty to acquaint mothers in particular, what a riſk they run in thus hazarding the health and lives of their children, together with their own preſent and future happineſs; and ſincerely hope I may imprint the ſame ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections upon them, that daily experience in my profeſſion preſents to me, againſt theſe pernicious cuſtoms.</p>

               <pb n="60" facs="unknown:024796_0057_0FC88F72979DEDD0"/>Oh! that I could prevail on my fair coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-women, to become ſtill more lovely in the ſight of men! Believe it not, when it is inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated that your boſoms are leſs charming, for having a dear little cherub at your breaſt. I ſpeak from the feelings of a man, and of one too who has an univerſal and generous love for the virtuous part of your ſex. Truſt me, there is no huſband could withſtand the fond ſolicitations of an endearing wife, would ſhe be earneſt in her deſire of bringing up her own children. Reſt aſſured, when he beholds the object of his ſoul cheriſhing and ſupporting in her arms the propitious reward of wedlock, and fondly traces his own lineaments in the darling boy, it recalls a thouſand delicate ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations to a generous mind: perhaps he drops a ſympathetic tear in recollecting the painful throes of the mother, which ſhe cheeefully bore, to make him ſuch an ineſtimable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. His love, tenderneſs, and gratitude, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus engaged—with what rapture, muſt he behold her, ſtill carefully intent upon the preſervation of his own image!</p>
            <p>How ardent ſoever ſuch an one's affections might be before matrimony, a ſcene like this will more firmly rivet the pleaſing fetters of love:—for, though a beautiful virgin muſt ever kindle emotions in a man of ſenſibility, a chaſte and tender wife, with a little one at her breaſt, is certainly to her huſband the moſt exquiſitely enchanting object upon earth:— and ſurely, ladies, had faſhion but eſtabliſhed

The management of infants from the birth—with direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for putting them to the breaſt.</head>
            <p>HAPPY, thrice happy woman, now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a joyful mother, nurturing her young! Say, tell me, you who know the rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous delight, how complete is the bliſs of enfolding in your longing arms the dear, dear fruits of all your pains!—pains now no more remembered. Long may you preſerve the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and be doubly bleſt in its future beauty, health, and virtue!</p>
            <p>I am not unmindful, my charming friends, of the prejudices neceſſary to be conquered, before ſo material a benefit to mankind, as that which I am to picture out in this letter, can be generally obtained. In my laſt, the misfortunes attending the neglect of this duty were fully explained; and as I have frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſucceeded among the private circle of my friends, by addreſſing their underſtanding, I truſt to the candour of the more ingenuous ſex, for my ſucceſs in public. My endeavour, therefore, throughout, ſhall be to convince
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:024796_0060_0FC88F7DD7CA4948"/>you that I have reaſon and truth on my ſide. Happy then ſhall I think myſelf, and amply rewarded for my trouble, if I am fortunate e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to meet with your approbation; as your obſervance of the rules laid down in this lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le manual muſt neceſſarily follow. Much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon your maternal care in the firſt ſtage of life; it is a pleaſing duty, to which you are honourably called, both by nature and the cuſtom of all nations.</p>
            <p>I am truly ſenſible, that, according to the preſent miſtaken manner of ſuckling and rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing children, the buſineſs is a fatigue, which frightens many at the firſt attempt; it is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod altogether culpable and unnatural. To this letter particularly belongs the firſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of them. In my next, I ſhall point out the ſubſequent errors, and lay down ſome general rules, that will not only prove benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to the child, but make the taſk of ſuckling eaſy and delightful to the mother: even the polite and gay may cheerfully undertake this, at preſent laborious, employment, without greatly interfering with a ſocial life—for the gloomy ideas of a nurſery will vaniſh. The paths of nature are eaſy and delightful. Come then, my fair, and let us follow her, ſtep by ſtep.</p>
            <p>We have before obſerved, that a child brings its immediate nouriſhment into the world with its birth. Man is born in ſorrow. The fatigue and pain of delivery, both to the mother and the child, require reſt; and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:024796_0061_0FC88F823395B810"/>where no improper means are uſed, they both directly-fall into a ſweet refreſhing ſleep; during which time the milky veſſels of the breaſt are dilated. Thus with prudent management, in a ſhort time a ſmall flow of milk will be obtained. The child, replete with nouriſhment at its birth, awakes equally refreſhed with the mother, and by eagerly ſucking the nipple encourages its more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſupply.</p>
            <p>Sometimes there may be a little inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with the firſt child; but this is rendered ſtill greater by keeping it away, perhaps two or three days, from the mother, and ſuffering her attendants to draw her breaſts, which ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally occaſions ſore nipples. The gentle, eaſy, and frequent ſuction of an infant, will not only prevent this inconvenience, but gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually invite the milk, thereby relieving the mother from a troubleſome burthen: the nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple alſo, by this means, will be drawn out, ſo that the child may ſuck without further diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. This is the leſſon nature teaches; and wiſe are they who obſerve her precepts.</p>
            <p>As to an infant's clothing, the lighter it is, and the more unconfined, the better; very little covering is neceſſary: and the future deformities of ſhape, &amp;c. not to mention the deplorable loſs of health, ſometimes proceed from the dreſs being too heavy and confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, at its firſt entrance into life.</p>
            <p>I am entirely againſt an infant's receiving any nouriſhment until it can be put to the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:024796_0062_0FC88F8423E41088"/>breaſt; and much more ſo againſt cramming it with what nurſes call pap. The ſtomach is not yet ſit for any other food than what Nature has prepared. Art cannot produce a diet with ſuch an affinity to animal blood, as to render it proper for the tender bowels of a new-born child.</p>
            <p>The cries of an infant are generally occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the uneaſineſs it ſuffers, either from its dreſs, or in conſequence of thus cramming it. The complaints of children in theſe early days, as I before obſerved, and likewiſe the difficulty in cutting of teeth, which I ſhall hereafter ſpeak of, proceed almoſt entirely from this wrong practice. Watery gripes, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive ſtools, and moſt diſorders in their bowels, are altogether occaſioned by impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per food.</p>
            <p>Cuſtom has rendered this ridiculous prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice ſo univerſal, that the good women conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually complain it is impoſſible for a child to remain without food till the milk comes. Let any mother make a fair and unprejudiced tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and experience will convince her of the truth of our maxim.</p>
            <p>How are other animals ſupported? Nature, in no one part of the creation, is ſo imperfect, as to be indebted to the wiſdom of man to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify her works. And ſuppoſe a caſe, in which the milk does not flow ſo ſoon as in general it is expected, let the child, under ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, be put to the breaſt again and again; a very little nouriſhment will at preſent ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:024796_0063_0FC88F86A3AD1268"/>and that will moſt commonly be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the nipple; if it is not, a little warm milk and water, with a ſmall quantity of Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon ſugar, is the only nouriſhment, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that is proper to be given: this advice I have cauſed to be ſtrictly followed, and have happily experienced the good effects of it in an infant of my own, who ſcarcely received any ſupport from the breaſt till after the third day from the birth. Follow, my dear ladies, theſe rules; and where there an hundred ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents that now happen to mothers, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of milk fevers, and to children, in conſequence of being denied the breaſt, you will rarely find one. I am convinced of the truth of my aſſertion by experience, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore am the more bold in recommending it to you, and to the public.</p>

            <head>LETTER VII.
A natural and eaſy method of ſuckling children.—This duty proved to be a pleaſure rather than a fatigue.</head>
            <p>NOW then, my nearly intereſted friends, let us obſerve thoſe parts of the creation where inſtinct only can direct, and for once learn a leſſon from the tender brute. Behold thoſe animals which are familiar to us, how ſucceſsful they are in bringing up their young: animals that give milk to three, four, five, ſix, and ſometimes more of their offspring at a birth. How well and happy are their dams! What unremitting care do they take of their nurſlings! They never deſert them, until time has given to their bodies ſtrength ſufficient to provide for themſelves. Provident nature!— and ſhall mankind alone diſtruſt thy good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Let us learn, and be wiſe. Never more ſuffer it to paſs for an argument, that a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who is capable of bearing a child, has not ſtrength to ſuckle it, when the little crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that ſurround us can rear a whole fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at once.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="unknown:024796_0065_0FC88F8DA8432CB8"/>O that I could convince you of the breaſt alone being a ſufficient ſupport for the moſt robuſt of children! Conſider nature well in all her works! Let ignorance and prejudice no longer prevail! Believe this ſolemn truth, almoſt every woman is capable of ſupporting her babe; and great will prove the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, both to herſelf and her infant. When it is confined altogether to the breaſt, it gains ſtrength every day, and defies diſeaſe. The mother, under theſe circumſtances, would not again conceive ſo quickly; and miſcarriages would thereby be, in a great meaſure, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented; unleſs hurried on by frequent bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and other miſtaken practices.</p>
            <p>If, for the ſake of your families, you value your own lives, attend to this indiſputable fact. You yourſelves know how many women are ruined in their health by not ſuckling their children; and what numbers are continually ſacrificed by unſkilful methods of treatment, at the time of their delivery. You may—you ſhould ſupport your young; the taſk is eaſy and delightful, and the thriving child rewards your pains. It is not laborious. I would not wiſh to ſee you ſlaves: the tender delicacy of your frame forbids the very thought. The method is plain and eaſy—only follow nature.</p>
            <p>Sleep is eſſentially neceſſary to life; and that the ſtomach ſhould ſometimes be at reſt, is as eſſentially neceſſary to health; both theſe things the mother and child equally require. Thus the ſlaviſh part of the buſineſs is ſet
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:024796_0066_0FC88F8F32BEF398"/>aſide; for it is an abſurd and erroneous cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, after ſtuffing it continually in the day, to keep a child at the breaſt all night. This counteracts the operations of nature, not only by depriving it of its reſt, but alſo, from a conſtant fullneſs, the powers of the infant-body are prevented from exerting themſelves in a proper manner upon the aliment receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Hence the ſtomach and bowels are enfee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and thereby rendered incapable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſuch wholeſome nouriſhment as a child would otherwiſe obtain from its food; to which grand purpoſe, ſound ſleep and abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence are equally conductive.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the mother, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually diſturbed during the night, is alſo prevented from aſſimilating that good and perfect milk, which would otherwiſe be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from the food of the day. Hence ſhe becomes ill, grows tired of her taſk, and the crude milk proves noxious to the weakened bowels of the infant. Thus diſappointment and death frequently ſucceed.</p>
            <p>I know it will be urged by ſome, that it is impoſſible to keep children quiet and at reſt, during the night, and that they cry for food. Let them be managed from the birth agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the directions here given, and then I believe few perſons will complain of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing troubleſome. One reaſon why children do not ſleep well by night is, that they are indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged too much in the cradle by day, when they ſhould have exerciſe. Another ſtill greater
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:024796_0067_0FC88F90A7B851D8"/>reaſon, I am inclined to think, proceeds from pain, occaſioned by improper food, in the firſt paſſages; for I will venture to affirm, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every child's bowels, from the preſent wrong management, are in a ſtate of diſeaſe, which too frequently grows up with it into life; and thus in infancy the lurking cauſe of a bad conſtitution is oftentimes eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>When their little ſtomachs, irritated by too large a quantity, and the bad quality of food, become ſomewhat empty; a pain, probably like what we call the heart-burn, and acidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at the ſtomach, awakens them from their diſturbed ſlumbers; and theſe little creatures can then only diſcover their uneaſineſs by cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Hence nurſes, partly for their own qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and partly through a miſtaken notion that children cry only for nouriſhment, cram them until they are quite gorged. Such infants ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly devour whatever is given them, becauſe the reception of food takes off that too great ſenſibility of the ſtomach which cauſed the pain. A ſimilar effect to this, grown perſons, troubled with the complaints I have now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, muſt every day experience upon tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nouriſhment; for it always affords a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent relief.</p>
            <p>Four or five times in the twenty-four hours are ſufficient for a child to receive the breaſt; and let the following rules be nearly obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. About ſix or ſeven in the morning, after which the child may be allowed an hour or two's ſleep;—again, an hour after the mother
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:024796_0068_0FC88F97308EF050"/>has breakfaſted—and a third time, if ſhe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, before dinner—a fourth time, at five or ſix o'clock in the evening, being two or three hours after dinner—and laſtly, between ten and eleven, juſt before ſhe goes to reſt.</p>
            <p>Now, by thoſe mothers who have ſervants to take off the laborious part of the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of children, this ſurely cannot be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a fatigue: that the taſk itſelf is a pleaſure, the fondneſs of nurſes towards children at the breaſt fully proves; and that it is an indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable duty, the feelings of human nature evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently proclaim.</p>
            <p>In the early months, ſleep may be indulged during the day; but exerciſe ſhould alſo at proper intervals be given to children. As they grow ſtronger, ſleep ſhould be leſs encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, and exerciſe increaſed.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral points of management that I have no fault to find with; and, among others, think it needleſs to dwell upon the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of keeping children dry and clean: it is ſo evident, that few nurſes are culpable in theſe particulars. But as to rocking children, the cuſtom is altogether abſurd. He was an ingenious man who invented a mouſe-trap, though none but a fool firſt thought of a cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle; it was certainly invented to ſave the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants trouble, for which, by the bye, they ſuffer more in return. I never permitted a cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle to diſgrace my nurſery. Infants, if well, ſleep without this lullaby-labour; and ſuch forced dozings generally render them peeviſh
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:024796_0069_0FC88F998AE250E0"/>and watchful in the night; which is the moſt proper time both for them and their nurſes to enjoy their reſt.</p>
            <p>At the end of ſix or ſeven months, when the four firſt teeth ought to appear, children ſhould be kept awake, and exerciſed as much as poſſible; by which time, if managed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, they will generally gain ſtrength e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to ſhoot theſe teeth, and the others will in due courſe be cut with eaſe,</p>
            <p>Thus you will avoid an evil that ſweeps away great numbers; of which, however, I ſhall ſpeak more fully in another letter; for It is entirely owing to the weakneſs of their bodies, that children cut their teeth with ſo much difficulty, and that it is attended with fever, convulſions, and death.</p>
            <p>This weakneſs of body is but little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood; for if a child be bloated with fat, which too generally happens when it is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly fed, the parents and their friends call it a fine child, and admire how it thrives—when, alas! that very fat is the diſeaſe which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders its conſtitution thus feeble: for if the butcher did not kill lambs and calves when they become immoderately fat, they likewiſe would die as frequently as children. Which death may be juſtly attributed to the prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous method, ſo generally in uſe, of giving them too much crude unſalutary nouriſhment; and not managing them in other reſpects as nature requires, to ſtrengthen the body from the food received.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="unknown:024796_0070_0FC88F9A8F1121C8"/>After what has been advanced concerning the early part of infant-management, give me leave to obſerve, that the arguments enforc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this important ſubject are ſubmitted to the conſideration of thoſe mothers who are deſirous of preferring a rational ſyſtem to bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goted maxims and opinions, I would wiſh them to be attended to, and I truſt that they will merit their approbation. I do not expect the foregoing rules to be invariably adopted from the birth. I know very well, and it is obvious to thoſe who have been attentive to children, that infants require ſome more, and others leſs attendance, eſpecially during the firſt month or two; and a certain time is neceſſary, even under the moſt prudent manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to accuſtom them to our wiſhed-for habits. There is a wide difference between knowing what is right, and doing it; and <hi>oftentimes,</hi> although we may be deſirous of ſtrictly following the moſt prudent maxims, difficulties will unexpectedly ariſe in the firſt attempts. Let me therefore deſire you to aim at the above regulations, which by perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance will ſoon become practicable; and then, determine for yourſelves, how greatly they will contribute to your own eaſe and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as well as to the advantage of your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</p>

            <head>LETTER VIII.
The proper method of weaning children.</head>
            <p>IN my laſt letter I condemned the preſent erroneous method of ſuckling and feeding children, and recommended a plain and eaſy way of rearing them to ſix or ſeven months old, upon a rational plan, pointed out by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in many different parts of the creation; and which moſt probably was ſtrictly follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by mankind in the early ages of the world, before luxury, pride, and indolence, crept in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſociety. Ancient hiſtory never could have boaſted of ſo many ſtrong and valiant men, had not mothers, in their infancy, given ſtrength and vigour to their conſtitutions; and the cauſe of the preſent puſillanimous, feeble, weakly, and diſeaſed race of mortals, may in ſome meaſure be aſcribed to the want of this earlieſt maternal care.</p>
            <p>Let us talk with the plain and ſimple huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman, who has a nurſery of trees under his direction: he will tell us it is not ſufficient for the ſtocks to be good of their kind; for,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:024796_0072_0FC88FA30D9226D0"/>unleſs they be ſecured from rude winds, and properly cultivated, ſo that they may receive nouriſhment, they will never thrive.</p>
            <p>It is literally the ſame in animal life; there are unfortunate mothers who daily and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully experience the truth of this argument. How many women are bleſt with fine chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, not a blemiſh, nor the mark of a diſeaſe, about them at their birth; and yet before ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny months are paſt, for want of prudent care and proper nouriſhment, do they not waſte away and die? I need not ſay more; the tears of many of my gentle readers, at the unhappy recollection, will ſufficiently teſtify the fact. May ſuch tears prove a warning for their fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conduct, and, truſt me, my honoured matrons, your ſorrow will be turned into Joy—a joy of the tendereſt nature, generous and truly laudable!</p>
            <p>Let not man, in the vanity of his heart, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in a ſuperiority over the fair ſex! for to them alone it belongs to lay the foundation, not of what he is, but what he ſhould be— healthy, ſtrong, and vigorous. You, ladies, form an hero in the cradle; and courage is received from the breaſt. Gratitude in return demands a protection to you from man. With yourſelves, therefore, it remains to render him capable of that protection. Thus nature, my fair-ones, ordained your importance in the creation.</p>
            <p>But to return to the huſbandman: he will again tell us, that when his trees have receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:024796_0073_0FC88FA5356AF128"/>their infant ſtrength, and their roots begin to ſhoot, it is neceſſary to tranſplant them from the nurſery to a more extenſive ſoil, in order that they may arrive at their natural perfection. So you, my friends, having brought the child through its infant ſtate, by the tender nouriſhment of the breaſt, muſt, at the time of weaning, (which, in my opinion, is beſt poſtponed until it be near a twelve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>month old) tranſplant your little nurſery like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to a more extenſive ſoil that is, you muſt afford it more copious nouriſhment, in order to bring it to maturer life.</p>
            <p>Yet, as great ſkill and caution are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red on the part of the huſbandman, in this buſineſs of tranſplanting, ſo great judgment and care muſt be ſhown by you, in this your province of weaning children; for cuſtom has ſo far deviated from nature, as to render the greateſt circumſpection neceſſary to point out the happy medium.</p>
            <p>A further care, therefore, at this time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands our attention. Man, according to the preſent mode, particularly in England, is greatly ſupported by animal food. A ſudden tranſition, from one extreme to another, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways dangerous; and every material altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to avoid inconveniencies, ſhould be brought about ſtep by ſtep. If nature ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended us to deſtroy the animals around us for prey, ſurely we may conclude this food never could be deſigned for our uſe, until ſuch time as we had teeth to eat it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="80" facs="unknown:024796_0074_0FC88FA66B1F1FA0"/>Many ill conſequences ariſe from perſons devouring their meals too eagerly; and if the ſtomachs of men are oppreſſed, by not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently chewing their meat, certainly the weak and tender ſtomachs of children, who have not as yet teeth ſufficient to break it, muſt be ſtill leſs fit to receive it altogether whole.</p>
            <p>Animal food, then, at this time of life, is abſolutely forbidden, from reaſon and reflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; but as it is in ſome meaſure neceſſary to prepare them for their future method of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, broths and jellies may be now given ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly, and, as they increaſe in ſtrength and age, more plentifully. Hereby the animal jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are received, which contain the only nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment in fleſh, without any labour to the ſtomach; and let it be remembered, that the juices of full-grown animals are to be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the younger and fattened kind; but more of this in its proper place.</p>
            <p>Let children at this time be fed once or twice a day with about a quarter of a pint of broth, and a little bread mixed in it. When you give a ſtiff jelly, a large tea-cup full is ſufficient; but I would recommend as much warm water, or milk, with it, and likewiſe a little bread. The breaſt ſhould not be allowed them now ſo often as when they were wholly confined to that nouriſhment; in ſhort, every meal that you thus introduce, ſhould ſupply one of the ſtated times of ſuckling. Thus are they gradually and inſenſibly weaned from
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:024796_0075_0FC88FA8097CB218"/>the breaſt, and accuſtomed to animal food, without any pining on their parts, or much trouble to the mother.</p>
            <p>Having ſhown the proper manner of putting a child to the breaſt, and likewiſe the moſt prudent method of taking it away; we ſhall, in the next letter, point out the ſafeſt rules for bringing children up by hand: but another obſervation or two will not be improper in this place.</p>
            <p>The gravy, which runs out of meat, upon cutting it when brought to table, is exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wholeſome, being nothing more than the pure juices of fleſh. A few ſpoonfuls of this beef or mutton gravy, mixed with an equal quantity of warm water, and a little ſalt, make very good broth. I mention this, becauſe parents generally imagine it to be unwhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for children; and oftentimes, when I have recommended it, ſome good old lady has ſtoutly oppoſed me, alleging that it fills a child with humours; whereas, on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, this is the only part of fleſh that produces good nouriſhment.</p>
            <p>Here let me proteſt againſt the cuſtom of not ſuffering children to eat ſalt, for fear of the ſcurvy; not making a diſtinction between ſalted meats, and ſalt eaten with meat. In this point alſo, ſtrong prejudices are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be combated with; for many a time have I been told by perſons of reverent years, that children were not ſuffered to eat ſalt in former days; adding, perhaps with, a ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:024796_0076_0FC88FABA4410D38"/>ſhrug, that the preſent age think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much wiſer than their forefathers.</p>
            <p>"Animal food, which has been any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time in ſalt, becomes hard, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires more force to break and digeſt it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for nouriſhment, than weak ſtomachs are capable of exerting; conſequently, ſalted beef, pork, and ſuch like things, are impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for children."</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, ſalt in itſelf is ſo far from producing; the ſcurvy, that it is now general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuppoſed to be its greateſt antidote; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, why do ſo many thouſands yearly flock to bathe, and drink ſea-water? There is, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, a certain ſtimulating quality in ſalt, that greatly promotes digeſtion; and whatſoever aſſiſts that office, muſt of courſe rather contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to purify the blood, than to render it foul; which is the ſuppoſed cauſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent frequently imagined, but oftentimes only a, faſhionable diſeaſe—called the ſcurvy.</p>
            <p>I have been repeatedly thanked for the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing information. A table ſpoonful or two of ſalt, put into a quart of ſpring water, is a moſt excellent waſh to cleanſe the ſkin, eſpecially if the face be well rubbed with a coarſe cloth ſome little time after it has been waſhed with the ſalt and water. By this means the pores of the ſkin will be kept open, and no obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſpiration will remain, which is the cauſe of carbuncles and thoſe red pimples which are generally miſtaken for the ſcurvy. It is this ſtimulating and cleanſing quality of ſalt that
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:024796_0077_0FC88FB1E2F7CC28"/>makes the ſea-water ſo uſeful to thoſe who are troubled with eruptions; therefore, by the above proportion, the water is rendered ſtill more efficacious, and will clear the face and neck of heats and pimples which frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſturb the ladies.</p>
            <p>I cannot bear the modern proſtitution of the words female delicacy: the duties of a mother are by ſome thought to be indelicate; and the appellation is now given only to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe and ſickneſs; for a woman muſt become a walking ghoſt, to be ſtyled truly delicate. I frequently lament, that the idea is not more ſtrictly confined to mental accompliſhments; nevertheleſs, I wiſh my fair friends to beſtow every rational and laudable attention to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their perſons neat, elegant, and engaging. I cannot conclude this letter better than by obſerving, that, although beauty ſtands like a cypher when alone, every additional qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation increaſes its merits ten-fold; and the leſs ſenſible of it the poſſeſſor herſelf appears to be, the more it will always be regarded by the admiring world.</p>

            <head>LETTER IX.</head>
            <head>The ſafeſt method of bringing children up by hand.</head>
            <p>WE have hitherto, my fair philoſophers, been carefully obſervant of, and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to, the laws of nature. Her paths are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely various. Every ſtep we take, affords new and engaging proſpects. We have traced man from the firſt period of his exiſtence, and have followed reaſon and inſtinct, to give him ſtrength and vigour in the earlieſt part of life. So fair a dawning promiſes a robuſt and healthy conſtitution; nevertheleſs, neceſſity obliges us to proceed to a further ſpeculation.</p>
            <p>Let it, therefore, be the buſineſs of this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to enquire how nearly art can ſupply the place of nature. Let us endeavour to point out a method to thoſe unfortunate mothers, who are, through neceſſity, deprived of the happy enjoyment of ſuckling their own chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. It may not prove unworthy the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe, who, by choice, commit them to the care of others. I propoſe to carry my obſervations in this letter, as far as my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:024796_0079_0FC88FB5585CB990"/>have been given to the valuable and truly praiſe-worthy matrons, whoſe duty to their family over-balances every other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. By and by, when the ſuckling is about to be weaned, and the dry-nurſed child brought equally forward, the rules of diet will be the ſame for both; on which account I went no farther in my laſt, than the proper period for introducing broths, jellies, &amp;c. All other conſiderations will be brought under general directions.</p>
            <p>Mother's milk we have ſhown to be the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and moſt proper ſupport for tender in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; it is a digeſted fluid, already animali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and therefore fitteſt for the nouriſhment of children. This remark alſo ſhows that the infant body is, by nature, deſigned to receive only a liquid nouriſhment; a hint particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to be attended to at this time, as it altogether obviates the general objections againſt confining children to milk, in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to thicker victuals, of which I ſhall ſpeak more fully before I conclude this letter.</p>
            <p>We have taken notice how tender the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and bowels of infants are, and have thence inferred, that almoſt every complaint they are afflicted with, proceeds from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper quality of their food: and the too large quantity given them, alſo increaſes the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. We took notice, that the digeſtive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of a new-born child are incapable of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a kind nutriment even from bread, and therefore exclaimed againſt feeding them with
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:024796_0080_0FC88FBC319753E8"/>what is called pap. But ſuppoſe it to be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: what a poor pittance of ſupport does ſuch a mother allow to her child, who gives it only bread and water!</p>
            <p>I have ſeen many fatal inſtances of ſuch ſtrange management. We ourſelves ſhould think it hard, indeed, and nothing but dire ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity could compel us to live thus ſparingly; beſides, how would our fleſh waſte, and our ſtrength decay! If ſo, ſurely it cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for an infant, whoſe bones have not as yet ſtrength ſufficient to ſupport its frame. How is it poſſible for a child to thrive under ſuch treatment?—Perhaps ſome will allow a little milk to be mixed with its food, but very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly; becauſe they imagine it ſtuffs the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and fills a child full of phlegm. Idle and ridiculous are theſe, and all other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that can be urged againſt this natural and ſalubrious diet.</p>
            <p>Milk is here ſpoken of in general terms; becauſe I intend, in a ſubſequent letter, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the ſeveral properties of different milks, and to remark the purpoſe to which each kind ſeems beſt adapted. Cow's milk being moſtly uſed, and in my opinion the propereſt, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, to anſwer our preſent deſign, I would therefore be underſtood to recommend that, if no other kind is particularly mentioned.</p>
            <p>I know very well that many perſons, and perhaps ſome gentlemen in the practice of phyſic, will differ from me in opinion, when I prefer cow's milk to every other kind of
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:024796_0081_0FC88FBF0A368C38"/>nouriſhment, in the early months, where it is neceſſary to bring a child up by hand. Let me beg of them only to make the experiment, as I ſpeak from experience; and if they have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to cenſure me afterwards, we ſhall meet upon equal terms; till then, at leaſt, I ſhall hope for candour from every one.</p>
            <p>It has frequently been ſuggeſted to me, that cow's milk is too rich, abounding alſo with too much cream, and that being of a fat oily nature, it will relax more than ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. But, however, this fault is not much to be apprehended from the milk uſed in and about London. Suppoſing it to be the caſe in the country, which I am far from allowing, you may let it ſtand till the cream riſes to the top, and uſe the ſkimmed milk; or by boiling deprive it of the greateſt part of this oily qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which collects itſelf upon the ſurface, and may then be readily taken off; or it may be diluted with water.</p>
            <p>Theſe doubts being removed, the milk of cows appears, I think, to be the propereſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute we can make, for that of the breaſt; and will anſwer beſt, after the firſt month or two, without boiling, unleſs it purges the child; in which caſe, boiling it will generally prevent the inconvenience, proceeding in all likelihood from its oily particles. I have no objection to a ſmall quantity of Liſbon ſugar being mixed with it, particularly if the child be coſtive; and indeed this may frequently be of uſe, to prevent its too great tendency to
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:024796_0082_0FC88FBFDC1ED270"/>become acid, from whence diſorders of the bowels ſometimes ariſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">Let it be remembered, that, through this ſyſtem of nurſing, children are ſuppoſed to be free from diſeaſe, and that I am to be conſidered not as the phyſician, but as the friend: when they are ill, it is the buſineſs of thoſe perſons who have the care of them, to direct a proper food; and upon many occaſions, milk may be ſo managed as to prove greatly inſtrumental, even as a well-adapted nouriſhment, to their recovery. In too laxative a habit of body, for inſtance, rice and cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon may be added; but then care ſhould be taken, that the rice be well boiled in water, before it is mixed with the milk. In the watery gripes, I frequently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the following diet, for infants: Boil a table ſpoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of ground rice, with a little cinnamon, in half a pint of water, till the water is nearly conſumed; then add a pint of milk, and let the whole gently ſimmer for five minutes; ſtrain it through a lawn ſieve, and make it palatable with a little ſugar. This food correſponds well, in ſuch complaints, with the curative intention.</note>
            </p>
            <p>One remark I ſhall beg leave to make, which comes in here with propriety. We have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice in a former letter of the cleanſing quality of mother's milk, upon its firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the breaſt. Now, where children are debarred from receiving it, a ſubſtitute of ſome gentle purgative is highly proper, to give ſuch a ſtimulus to the bowels, as nature has provided by the mother's means. What I have experienced to be the beſt calculated for anſwering this purpoſe, is ſomething of the following kind.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe we ſay, <hi>ſyrup of violets and oil of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, of each one ounce, with four or five grains of rhubarb.</hi> This compoſition being ſhaken
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:024796_0083_0FC88FC19D0369F8"/>will pretty well unite. A tea-ſpoonful may be given as often as you find it neceſſary.</p>
            <p>In caſe the milk be thrown up in a curdled ſtate, a ſmall quantity of ſalt will generally prevent it; a circumſtance I would wiſh to have attended to; as many children are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to this complaint; and it is a method I have ſeldom known to fail, unleſs they are greatly over-fed. Whenever a child throws up the milk, it is to be conſidered as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and particularly ſo if it appears cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled; becauſe it has then paſſed through the firſt change it undergoes in the ſtomach, and conſequently diſcovers that the ſtomach itſelf is too feeble to execute its further office. In this caſe, ſometimes the ſtomach abounds with too great an acidity, but more frequently it is loaded and oppreſſed by the quantity which has been given to the infant. Milk always cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles in the ſtomach; and it is only a vulgar error to ſuppoſe the contrary; for by this means it becomes a ſubſtantial aliment, and affords a proper nouriſhment to children and other animals; whereas, if it continued in a fluid ſtate, it would contribute but little to their ſupport.</p>
            <p>What we have next to obſerve, is the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of milk proper to be given to a new-born child, in the twenty-four hours. What think you, my dear ladies, of a Wincheſter pint be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſufficient quantity for the day and night! Methinks I hear an exclamation—O barbarous man! Under a pretence of correcting us, he
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:024796_0084_0FC88FC6E1249A98"/>intends to ſtarve the little helpleſs creatures. Was there ever ſuch a cruelty heard of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Allow a child only a pint of milk in a day! Why, it would eat two quarts of pap, and ſtill cry for more.—Yet, after all ſurpriſe, an infant in the month will receive, from one pint of milk, more real and good nouriſhment, than from ten quarts of pap, as it is called; indeed I might ſay more nouriſhment than from any other kind of ſupport: for, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the juices which afford ſuſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance are all liquid, it is neceſſary they ſhould, contain the eſſence of ſubſtantial food: and although a man who is accuſtomed to daily labour, would ſoon be emaciated by living continually upon broths, yet milk alone would ſupport his ſtrength and ſpirits, becauſe it cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles in the ſtomach, and thereby becomes a more ſolid and nutritious aliment. And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let me again remind you, that not only the human ſpecies, but likewiſe all other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, receive their continual nouriſhment from a milky juice which is prepared in their own bodies from the aliment received, as was before explained in the fourth letter.</p>
            <p>There are, as we have mentioned, very great errors in the quantities as well as the qualities of infants' food. It was before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that children's ſtomachs ſhould not be always crammed. To this it is in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure owing that they are ſo continually puk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: a circumſtance looked upon by ſome to be natural and wholeſome, who prepoſterouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:024796_0085_0FC88FCB4017D590"/>encourage this diſpoſition by frequent vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits. But, ſurely, nature never intended more nouriſhment to be received than is neceſſary for our ſupport. Does any perſon in a good ſtate of health, after a moderate and proper meal, ever find an inclination to throw it up again? Are the young offspring of other ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals conſtantly puking? How therefore can it be ſuppoſed natural for children to do ſo? A little reflexion would ſoon convince ſuch ſuperficial obſervers of their error; for you will rarely find a child throw up its food, when properly nurſed.</p>
            <p>If one pint of milk, therefore, in the firſt week or two, be too little, it is an error on the right ſide; for it appears to be enough to ſupport the child; and much worſe conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences are to be apprehended from giving it too much. We muſt, every one of us, have often experienced how neceſſary it is to be hungry, in order to reliſh our food; and that to be continually indulging, palls the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite. Certainly then, it muſt be equally neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that the infant ſtomach ſhould ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times know the ſenſe of hunger.</p>
            <p>Would not three or four pints of milk, in the twenty-four hours, ſupport a grown per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? If ſo, undoubtedly one third part is am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply ſufficient to nouriſh a new-born child. But I would not be underſtood to cavil ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly for a ſpoonful or two; I only mean to aſſiſt the candid enquirer in this moſt eſſential part of the management of children, who are denied the breaſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="93" facs="unknown:024796_0086_0FC88FCCA1D90618"/>We come next to aſcertain the proper quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity to be given for a meal. A quarter of a pint is fully ſufficient to be taken at a time; and let the hours of feeding, as well as every other particular, be regulated according to the rules laid down in the ſeventh letter. In ten days, or a fortnight, you may increaſe the daily allowance a quarter of a pint: and at the end of a month you may allow a pint and a half in the twenty-four hours: another half-pint may be gradually permitted by the time it is three months old; and this quantity, if the child is voracious, may be ſtill increaſed to three pints in the day; which, I am perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if the milk be good, will prove ſufficient: and this allowance will, I hope, cancel the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of every matron's cenſure.</p>
            <p>Having now given you my thoughts upon this part of infant management, there is but one rational objection that ſtrikes me, againſt the propriety of ſo plain and ſimple a method of bringing children up by hand. Their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral food is allowed to be milk—but it may be urged, that the human milk, in conſequence of the mother's diet, is more ſtrengthening than that of cows, aſſes, or any other ſpecies of brutes. Granted—but then again this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument equally proves, that cow's milk par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes more of a vegetable nature than the milk of women; and, during the early months, all that the advocates for the preſent cuſtom would contend for, is—what? pap, panado, &amp;c. which are of the vegetable kind; and
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:024796_0087_0FC88FCE5707F730"/>therefore their arguments require no farther anſwer. Were it propoſed to add ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per broths to cow's milk, after the firſt four or five weeks, where there is no circumſtance particularly to forbid it, the deſign would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear reaſonable, in ſupplying the ſuppoſed deficiency of the animal property; and it is a point I would readily join in, nay, it is what I mean to recommend towards the end of the third month. I frequently order milk and broth to be mixed together, and think it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per food. But let every ſuch meal, however, as before adviſed, ſupply the place of the uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al milk. In whatever way you manage chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, be careful not to feed them over-much.</p>
            <p>There is yet a circumſtance of great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be attended to, and, if rightly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended by my fair pupils, will convince them, that the allowance for the earlier months is amply ſufficient: it is the manner in which infants ought to be fed.</p>
            <p>Surely it is wrong to put a large boat full of pap into their little mouths, ſuffering them to ſwallow the whole of it in the ſpace of a minute; and then perhaps, from their cries, to ply them with a ſecond, which is no ſooner down than thrown up again.</p>
            <p>We have mentioned the ill conſequences of grown perſons devouring their victuals too eagerly; and experience muſt often have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced every one, that a much leſs quantity than we generally take, if eaten leiſurely, and well chewed, will ſuffice for a meal; and alſo
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:024796_0088_0FC88FD0160373C8"/>that, after ſuch meals, we ſeem more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, and are inclined to purſue either bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs or pleaſure with far greater eaſe to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. On the contrary, from a too haſty and hearty meal the ſtomach will be diſtended over-much, which is always productive of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence, and a tendency to ſleep. The ſame muſt certainly hold good with reſpect to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.</p>
            <p>Beſides, to obtain milk from the breaſt, nature wiſely obliges them to earn their nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment by the labour of drawing it. The ſtream being exceedingly ſmall upon the milk's firſt coming into the breaſt, it requires a long time to procure a quarter of a pint; and the very exerciſe fatigues them, before they have received too much. This, in my opinion, fully proves that quantity to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient for a meal.</p>
            <p>There is nothing, therefore, wanting, I hope, to complete our ſyſtem, but a contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to ſupply the place of a nipple, that the child may ſtill labour to obtain its ſupport; which alone will greatly prevent the error in quantity. I have ſeen ſome inventions of this kind, by means of parchment or leather ſew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the pointed end of a horn, which is no bad thought, and capable of great improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Hollanders, when they travel, have a ſmall pewter veſſel, ſomewhat in the form of a cone, which is filled with milk, and a piece of ſponge covered with a linen cloth is tied over the ſmaller end. This ſerves the
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:024796_0089_0FC88FD504C59A78"/>children very well as an artificial nipple: for it is obſerved, that a Dutch woman ſeldom or never gives ſuck to her child before ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>We have plainly demonſtrated, that infant nouriſhment, particularly in the early months, is deſigned by nature to be altogether liquid: againſt ſuch contrivances, therefore, I cannot ſee an objection.</p>
            <p>Would you, my fair friends, undertake this purſuit, from the happy fertility of female imagination, I am certain a little experience would point out to you a ready and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent method to anſwer every purpoſe; and I am thoroughly ſatisfied, the happy conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces would amply reward your pains—by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving many dear little innocents, that daily fall a ſacrifice to repletion or over-feeding.</p>

               <p>P. S.—Since this book made its firſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, I have contrived a milk-pot for my own nurſery upon the above principles; it appears to my family, and to many of my patients, preferable to thoſe now in uſe, and may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be ſtill further improved. For the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of my readers, I ſhall give a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. This pot is ſomewhat in form like an urn; it contains a little more than a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a pint; its handle, and neck or ſpout, are not unlike thoſe of a coffee-pot, except that the neck of this ariſes from the very bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the pot, and is very ſmall; in ſhort, it is upon the ſame principle as thoſe gravy-pots which ſeparate the gravy from the oily fat.
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:024796_0090_0FC88FD717391568"/>The end of the ſpout is a little raiſed, and forms a roundiſh knob, ſomewhat in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance like a ſmall heart; this is perforated by three or four ſmall holes: a piece of fine rag is tied looſely over it, which ſerves the child to play with inſtead of the nipple, and through which, by the infant's ſucking, the milk is conſtantly ſtrained. The child is equally ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied as it would be with the breaſt; it never wets him in the leaſt; he is obliged to labour for every drop he receives, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as when at the breaſt; and, greatly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of this contrivance, the nurſes confeſs it is more convenient than a boat, and that it ſaves a great deal of trouble in the feeding of an infant; which is the greateſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity to parents, that their ſervants will uſe it, when they themſelves are not preſent.</p>

            <head>LETTER X.
A general management of children, from the time of weaning, till they are about two years old—with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon the cutting of teeth.</head>
            <p>I AM juſt now returned from a nurſery, where, with ſincere pleaſure, I beheld a happy mother with a pretty little puppet at her breaſt, which ſhe had the ſatisfaction of ſaving in its earlieſt days, by her amiable af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and tenderneſs; an infant born under melancholy circumſtances, when the mother herſelf was afflicted with a terrible quincy in her throat, and had been confined to a ſick chamber five or ſix weeks before her delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. No one expected the life of the child, and the mother's was equally doubtful. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the greateſt care on her part could have ſaved the infant; and, had it been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to any other perſon, the diſeaſed ſtate of its bowels at the birth would, probably, very ſoon have put a period to its exiſtence.</p>
            <p>Judge, ye conſiderate fair, indulge with me the pleaſing reflexions of this good woman! Behold her, fondling at the breaſt a ſmiling bey, to whom ſhe not only gave a being, but
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:024796_0092_0FC88E03E9323BF0"/>generouſly preferred his welfare, and dared, even contrary to the advice of her friends, to ſuckle him, thereby endangering her own, to preſerve the life of her child. May gratitude and duty expand within his breaſt, and prompt him virtuouſly to reward this truly maternal affection! May he, in future years, become the pleaſure and ſupport of her declining life!</p>
            <p>This amiable mother has three other little ones, that for health and beauty ſtand almoſt unrivalled; all nurtured under her own wing—ſupported by her breaſt. What an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement is this to follow nature! Her heart was never torn by the bitter reflexion of not having done her duty to her family. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample glorious! worthy of praiſe—worthy of imitation!</p>
            <p>But to return to our preſent point: the ſuckling being weaned, and the dry-nurſed child brought equally forward; we ſhall now join our different nurſeries together, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make them thrive under one ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral direction.</p>
            <p>I muſt, however, beg leave to mention, that as I before adviſed to have the child kept to the breaſt till it is near twelve months old, and have alſo pointed out the prudent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of introducing broths and jellies, prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative to weaning it entirely; ſo this letter is deſigned to recommend a proper manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of infants from the period of one to two years of age.</p>
            <p>The beſt method likewiſe having been laid
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:024796_0093_0FC88E0AA42F07F0"/>down for bringing children up by hand, upon thoſe principles that approach neareſt to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which ſurely renders them unexception<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and having indulged them with broths and jellies earlier than the ſucking child; I ſhall ſuppoſe theſe alſo gradually brought on to the twelfth month, and thence proceed with both together.</p>
            <p>I moſt earneſtly recommend that they be ſtrictly confined to the following diet, and not fed oftener than three, or four times at moſt, in the twenty-four hours. The quantity for each meal may now with propriety be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably increaſed; it will be longer, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, of conſequence, before the ſtomach be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes empty.</p>
            <p>Thus, for inſtance, let their breakfaſt, at ſix or ſeven in the morning, be half a pint of new milk with about two ounces of bread in it. The ſecond meal ſhould be half a pint of good broth, with the ſame quantity of bread; let this be given about ten or eleven in the morning. The third meal, about two or three in the afternoon, ſhould be broth in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: and their ſupper, about ſix in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, new milk and bread, the ſame as for breakfaſt. When you ſubſtitute jellies, or gravies, for broth, let them be always plain and ſimple; and a leſs quantity will prove ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient.<note n="*" place="bottom">Under the article <hi>ſalop</hi> in the Family Phyſician, p. 26, you will find proper directions to prepare an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtrengthening food, by mixing ſalop with milk, which makes it of the conſiſtence of a cuſtard. This preparation of milk is highly proper for children, inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, and aged perſons; and it is withal a very agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and palatable nouriſhment.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="unknown:024796_0094_0FC88E0D71938F10"/>If children are thirſty between their meals, a little barley-water and milk may be given them; but I would not too frequently encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage this cuſtom.</p>
            <p>From hence, the general intention appears throughout, to decreaſe the quantity of milk, as you introduce other ſubſtantial and proper nouriſhment—though I would always allow children a pint of milk each day.</p>
            <p>Biſcuits, ſweet-meats, ſugar plums, &amp;c. all which tend to ſpoil the appetite, are highly improper, and ought to be looked upon as one of the pernicious effects of luxury. Where is there a child, unaccuſtomed to ſuch indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that would not be equally pleaſed with a cruſt of bread? It is not my buſineſs here to enter ſo philoſophically into the doctrine of nouriſhment, as to contend with thoſe who ſuppoſe it altogether to proceed from the ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charine qualities of food: but allowing them the utmoſt force of their arguments, I anſwer, that nature will always prove the beſt chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt, to ſeparate theſe ſugar-like particles from the aliment we take in. So much for the preſent, with regard to the regulation of their diet.</p>
            <p>As to other particulars: Little or no ſleep ſhould now be permitted in the day. Air and exerciſe are greatly to be recommended. Let
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:024796_0095_0FC88E0E596B2BF0"/>them riſe as early as you pleaſe; and the ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they are put to bed, when the evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to ſhut in, the better. Their clothing ſhould now, and indeed always, be light and eaſy. By no means ſuffer children to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in very warm rooms, but accuſtom them by degrees to thoſe variations of the ſeaſons, which they will be compelled to ſtruggle with in future life.</p>
            <p>It is a great misfortune for children to be brought up too tenderly. Should Providence hereafter deſign them to contend with difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, how little capable will they be of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering them? The child thus nurtured moſt commonly grows up too delicate and feeble to encounter hardſhips. Should neceſſity, or chance, hereafter lead him to ſeek his fortune on the raging ſeas, or to bear his part in the hardy ſervice of his country by land; how pitiful will ſuch a man appear! How unequal to the neceſſary toils of ſieges, ſtorms, and tempeſts!—But, however, this great error, to the credit of good mothers be it confeſſed, is of late years much corrected.</p>
            <p>I beg leave, my fair friends, to ſay ſomething concerning their being put upon their feet. With reſpect to the time, the ſtrength of the child muſt determine that period. Of this be aſſured, that all children will ſhow an inclination to walk, as ſoon as their bones have acquired a firmneſs ſufficient to ſupport the body. I am fearful many heavy children are injured by exciting their feeble efforts to
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:024796_0096_0FC88E0FDA938EF0"/>walk too ſoon. Doubtleſs it is a convenience and eaſe to nurſes to ſet them upon their feet, as they do not then require exerciſe in the arms; and conſequently are not ſo great a trouble and fatigue to thoſe who have the care of them. But it is a fault entirely to be condemned, and what I particularly caution you againſt; becauſe, whoever you may have to attend upon your children, they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly encourage them to walk, for reaſons above mentioned.</p>
            <p>Therefore throw aſide your leading-ſtrings, and your back-ſtrings, and every other crafty invention which tends to put children for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warder than nature deſigned. Our young plants are to be cultivated without art. The induſtrious gardener, it is true, can boaſt of his exotics, and early fruits, by forcing their growth. Yet ſay, ye ſons of Epicurus, are your grapes or pines thus raiſed, equal to the produce of their natural climate? And not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the merit of your gardener, who is thus capable of gratifying this high zeſt of luxurious extravagance; even in this your boaſted pride, a ſimple clown would be wiſe enough to expoſe your folly, by the honeſt preference which he would give to nature. Such as the fruits are, watery and inſipid; ſuch alſo are the plants thus forced, weakly and tender; ſuſceptible of the ſlighteſt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and expoſed to continual dangers: ſuch likewiſe are the poor feeble infants, forced upon their legs before nature has deſigned
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:024796_0097_0FC88E1780E00790"/>them; while others, managed without art, like fruitful vines, defy the inclement ſeaſons, and triumph in their natural ſtrength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour.</p>
            <p>I do not mean, from what has been ſaid up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſubject, to prevent them, when they really ſhow an inclination to walk, but to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh you againſt being too precipitate. It is, in my opinion, a good method to ſuffer the little creatures firſt to crawl upon a carpet, or any other convenient place; permitting them to tumble about as much as they pleaſe. By this means an exerciſe will be given to the body and limbs, without their continuing in one poſition long enough to hazard a diſtortion, from too great a weight of body. Thus let them, by degrees, learn to walk upright, which their own inclinations, in imitation of thoſe about them, will prompt them to, full as ſoon as nature deſigned.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now beg leave to offer a few hints with reſpect to the teeth: a circumſtance this, materially to be attended to, as woful experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence daily convinces us.</p>
            <p>Children are teazed with cutting of teeth from four or five months, till they are two years old, and upwards; nay, ſome are ſo backward as not to have their complete num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber till they are turned of three years old. I ſhall not enter into the diſtinction of teeth, but ſpeak of them in general, ſo as to give a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent idea of the precautions I mean to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="unknown:024796_0098_0FC88E18E8F85B88"/>It is alſo very uncertain with reſpect to the exact time of their ſhooting any of their teeth; but this alſo, I believe, chiefly depends upon the ſtrength of the conſtitution; and if the rules laid down in the preceding letters be properly obſerved, you will generally find children cut all their teeth by the time they are about two years old. You will, likewiſe, rarely meet with an inſtance of their being cut with difficulty. It has been already taken no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, that the reaſon of their being back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in their teeth, and ſo many children loſt on this account, is entirely owing to a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of body, which is a fact that ſcarcely any one will deny.</p>
            <p>Yet, where the conſtitution is not ſtrong e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of itſelf, as a great aſſiſtance may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by lancing of the gums, let not a falſe tenderneſs prevent fond mothers from allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch relief to their little babes, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruciating tortures they ſuffer by the cutting of teeth. The operation is not to be deemed pain; for if you put any thing with a ſharp edge into their mouths, they will ſave you the trouble of doing it, by preſſing hard againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, and cutting the gum themſelves.</p>
            <p>When the teeth are diſcernible to the ſight or touch, there is very little ſenſe of feeling in the gum; their tortures proceed from the ſenſibility of a fine membrane which envelopes the tooth. If that membrane is ſufficiently divided, although the gum ſhould again unite, there will be no more trouble; for teeth thus
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:024796_0099_0FC88E1A5BBF39C8"/>lanced will gradually advance without future pain. Never, therefore, I ſay, let a prejudice like this hinder you from relieving ſuch poor little helpleſs creatures.</p>
            <p>There are many perſons, who, about the age of twenty, have two, and ſometimes four, additional teeth, at the furthermoſt part of the jaws; and, from the time of life in which they appear, they are called the teeth of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Let me deſire ſuch wiſe ones, ſenſible of the pain upon this occaſion, to reflect how inſupportable it muſt be to many infants, who perhaps are cutting the whole of their teeth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at once; at a time too, when their tender frames are but little capable of bearing pain. Many grown perſons are obliged to have ſuch teeth lanced; let them declare how much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief they found from this ſimple, but uſeful operation.</p>
            <p>Candid reaſoning, from experience, is the ſureſt way to conquer prejudices; and thoſe who give themſelves leave to think upon the point with candour, will, I doubt not, allow the force of this argument.</p>
            <p>It may not be unſeaſonable, in this place, to give a caution, which thoſe who lance teeth would do well to obſerve; as careleſſneſs or ignorance in the operation frequently fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trates the intended benefit. Let me adviſe you not to depend upon old women, or nurſes, who undertake to do it with crooked ſixpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and ſuch like ineffectual means.</p>
            <p>We took notice a little above, that the pain
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:024796_0100_0FC88E1CA8B31CF8"/>ariſes, not from the gum, but from the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a fine membrane which envelopes the teeth. It is not, therefore, ſufficient to make a longitudinal inciſion into the gum, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too commonly done without dividing this membrane; in which caſe, inſtead of good, it does hurt. After cutting through the gum, the inſtrument ſhould be drawn round the tooth; and the perſon ſhould be ſatisfied, that it grates in every part againſt the tooth, which will effectually divide this too ſenſible mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane. Where the gum is exceedingly tough, a tranſverſe inciſion ought likewiſe to be made, and with theſe precautions the operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will aſſuredly ſucceed. Parents cannot be too careful in this particular; for I have often obſerved ill conſequences from the careleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs before mentioned.</p>
            <p>In my obſervations upon children that are loſt between the age of five months and three years, I have found they are generally carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off either by ſudden convulſions, or what is called a tooth-fever, or a waſting of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: in the two laſt caſes, the ſcene likewiſe is commonly cloſed with convulſive fits.</p>
            <p>The original cauſe of theſe diſaſters having been frequently taken notice of to proceed from the wrong management of children, it appears equally evident to me, that the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate cauſe of theſe fits almoſt always ariſes from want of ſtrength in the conſtitution to cut the teeth. It is true, the bowels ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are greatly affected, which indeed ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:024796_0101_0FC88E1EDE9204F0"/>attends a waſting of the body; but then the immediate cauſe of ſuch complaints at this time is moſt commonly the teeth: for if children are capable of enduring the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per aliments before mentioned in their moſt tender ſtate, during the firſt four or five months; ſurely, without ſome more active principle, the vital powers would not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards be by them alone ſubdued.</p>
            <p>This makes me particularly ſolicitous to recommend lancing of the gums before it is too late to aſſiſt children; being firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that many might be ſaved, who daily fall a ſacrifice to thoſe complaints for want of it.</p>
            <p>Among many other inſtances that I could relate, to ſhow the neceſſity of admitting this operation before the ſtrength of the child be decayed, and its body waſted, I ſhall conclude this letter with a remarkable caſe of this ſort.</p>
            <p>A poor woman in the neighbourhood, ſome time ſince, brought her child to me: he was apparently a ſtout fine boy, and then about nine months old. She deſired my advice for an eruption the child had all over his body, which ſhe called ſcurvy; but I found it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than ſome pimples proceeding from the improper quality of its food; and in fact, notwithſtanding the chubby appearance of the boy (which in reality was nothing more than bloated fat), he was actually of a very weakly frame, as appears by the ſequel—and
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:024796_0102_0FC88E24B820D1F8"/>I think it neceſſary, as a farther confirmation of my aſſertion, to inform you, that his father was at this time between ſixty and ſeventy, his mother not leſs than four or five and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years of age.</p>
            <p>Near or quite ſix months afterwards, the ſame woman came to beg the favour of me to look at her child again, who, ſhe ſaid, was dying. I ſaw an infant worn away to a mere ſkeleton; and, upon enquiry, found it to be the ſame chubby fat boy I had ſeen before. He lay panting for breath, and had taken little or no nouriſhment for twenty-four hours. Upon examining the little patient, there was not a tooth appeared. The cauſe of the diſeaſe, therefore, was immediately evident to me; but I told her it was too late to be of ſervice, for I found the child could not recover.</p>
            <p>However, to ſatisfy the mother, I adviſed lancing the gums. To the aſtoniſhment of every one about the child, ſixteen large teeth were cut out; but the gums being very much hardened, for want of this operation, it was with no ſmall difficulty now performed. The immediate relief which the child received, ſurpriſed them all ſtill more. From a convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſtate that he before lay in, he inſtantly recovered, took notice of every body in the room, and, during the time I ſtaid, eagerly devoured a conſiderable quantity of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The grateful parent thanked me a thouſand times, and reflected upon herſelf for delaying
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:024796_0103_0FC88E259AA61CF0"/>to apply to me before. But, alas! I foreſaw it was only a temporary relief, his ſtrength being utterly exhauſted. I left her, without giving the leaſt hopes of his recovery; and the next morning the child died. A reflexion upon this caſe, I take for granted, is entirely needleſs. It is evident, had the teeth been cut in due time, this fatal accident would not have happened.</p>
            <p>It is, indeed, a topic of ſerious concern; but as it comes under the claſs of diſeaſes to which infants are ſubject, it cannot be enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon in this little volume. Some opinions, and medical obſervations, are thrown out in the introduction to theſe letters, which, if carefully attended to, may aſſiſt the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent parent in her endeavours to preſerve the lives of ſuch little innocents. A table of births and infant burials is alſo inſerted, which proves the melancholy truths I am aiming to eſtabliſh.</p>

            <head>LETTER XI.
A general management of children, from two years old, till they leave the nurſery.</head>
            <p>THE cultivation of the mind I have inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally reſerved for the ſubject of my next letter; for which reaſon I ſhall now fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh my obſervations upon nurſing, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to point out the ſafeſt and moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent method of introducing children into the family way of living.</p>
            <p>At length, after ſurmounting the difficulties and inconveniencies attending the cutting of their teeth, we have now ſet them upon their legs; to the no ſmall joy of the mother, and the relief of thoſe ſervants whoſe buſineſs it is to wait upon them.</p>
            <p>We have hitherto permitted breed, milk, and the juices only of fleſh; and before we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance any farther, I beg leave to make the following remarks, by which my intelligent readers may profit.</p>
            <p>The food of man, in all its various ſhapes, however tortured and diſguiſed, is ſtill confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to animal and vegetable productions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="unknown:024796_0105_0FC88E2F1BD6EC30"/>Of vegetables, bread is the moſt valuable preparation, as the experience of ages proves. That made from wheat flour is ſtill the moſt ſtrengthening, and ever to be preferred by thoſe who have the means of obtaining it.</p>
            <p>The milk of cows, although it may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed not to partake ſo much of a ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nature as the human milk, thoſe creatures feeding altogether upon vegetables, is, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, to be conſidered as a food partly ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, and partly vegetable, prepared alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an all-wiſe direction.</p>
            <p>Gravies, jellies, and broths, we know, are animal juices; either ſpontaneouſly flowing from fleſh, upon cutting it, after it is dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or obtained by a maceration of it in wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p>From theſe reflexions, therefore, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that in the regimen already permitted, the moſt valuable ſupplies of life are granted, and in a manner the beſt adapted to infant conſtitutions; requiring but little exertion of the digeſtive faculties, and gradually introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing that nutriment, which, as the body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes ſtronger, it muſt prepare for itſelf from the groſſer aliments.</p>
            <p>The intention of what has been ſaid is to encourage, as much as poſſible, the continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this diet a little longer; and, indeed, ſome of the fineſt children I ever ſaw, have been chiefly confined to a food like this, for the firſt five or ſix years. But although I ſtrongly recommend it, and am conſcious that chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:024796_0106_0FC88E305A92D370"/>unacquainted with the indulgence of variety, would be perfectly ſatisfied without animal food; yet I am perſuaded that the culpable fondneſs of moſt parents will initiate them, too early, into the luxuries of a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful table.</p>
            <p>It is true, we made an obſervation, that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture never intended fleſh for our food, until we had teeth to eat it; but it by no means follows, as ſoon as we have our teeth, that with an unbounded freedom we are to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour animal food. Remember, likewiſe, ye too indulgent parents, it has been before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that every alteration in our manner of living ſhould be brought about ſtep by ſtep, haſty tranſitions being always dangerous: and let this teach us to be cautious in our manner of admitting fleſh into the meals of children.</p>
            <p>After what has been advanced, and after having given you my opinion that it is yet time enough to ſuffer children to eat fleſh, I now leave this very important point to the diſcretion of parents: however, permit me to recommend, that when fleſh is firſt intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced into their food, at whatever time it may be, this part of their diet ſhould be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed them but ſparingly; and a regard alſo ſhould be paid to its quality.</p>
            <p>The fleſh of barn-door fowls, beef, mutton, and full-grown animals in general, is the beſt. Crammed poultry, calves, and houſe-fed lambs, kept up to fatten, are improper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their juices yield by far leſs nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="unknown:024796_0107_0FC88E319CEEB918"/>Hence, beef tea, and mutton broth, are preferable to thoſe made from lamb or veal. The fleſh alſo of ſuch young fattened animals does not paſs off weak ſtomachs ſo eaſily as the other.</p>
            <p>High-ſeaſoned gravies, and ſoups, made diſhes, and ſalted meats, are ever to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; though ſalt with their meats may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, for the reaſons before given.</p>
            <p>Although it is not meant to confine them at this age ſo ſtrictly to bread, I am by no means for permitting too free a uſe of vegetables; being convinced, that ſome complaints of the bowels, in children more advanced in life, proceed from this error, and particularly worms: ſince, if the eggs of theſe inſects are not taken in, together with theſe productions of the garden, on which they harbour and feed, yet this food at leaſt affords a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able quantity of ſlime, which, ſtagnating in the bowels, ſerves as an habitation for theſe pernicious little animals. This is my reaſon for allowing a little wine, now and then, to be given to children, and I am perſuaded that I have ſeen its good effect. Care ſhould be taken in the choice of vegetables; thoſe of the mealy kind, that approach the neareſt to bread, are to be preferred, ſuch as potatoes, rice, &amp;c. Turnips are alſo good. Lettuces, and ſome few others, may, in moderation, be given to them, which your own prudence muſt point out.</p>
            <p>The kitchen preparations of milk, ſuch as
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:024796_0108_0FC88E3318EAEFD0"/>cuſtards, blamange, white-pots, &amp;c. are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly proper; and in this kind of food a greater variation may be indulged with leſs harm, being, for the moſt part, equally good and innocent. Salop mixed with milk, as mentioned in the laſt letter, may be granted as often as you pleaſe; and let it be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that it is the beſt way of giving that nutritious vegetable to children and inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Family Phyſician, p. 26.</note> Eggs are good; and if the yelks be beaten up with warm milk, without boiling, they afford the beſt nouriſhment; yet, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they are dreſſed, never ſuffer children to eat them, if the yelks be hard. Puddings in general are likewiſe good; but the moſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are beſt. Tarts and fruit-pies may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in moderation.</p>
            <p>Shell-fiſh, and indeed moſt other kinds, may, now and then, be given; but the firmeſt are to be preferred. Theſe are the moſt prudent directions that occur to my memory; but, after all, thoſe are wiſeſt who do not pamper young children with too great a variety.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not trouble you with the curative part of diſeaſes incident to children, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogether the concern of the phyſician; though it would give me a real pleaſure to ſee ſuch complaints treated of, in a maſterly man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, by ſome accurate obſerver of nature. This preſent ſyſtem of nurſing is intended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:024796_0109_0FC88E39E5C1D138"/>to manage children ſo as to prevent illneſs; and it has coſt me no ſmall pains to ſeparate the two provinces, which, I hope, is effected to the ſatisfaction of my readers.</p>
            <p>As to rhubarb, Gaſcoign's powder, magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, &amp;c. every mother's obſervations in ſome meaſure direct a proper uſe of them<note n="*" place="bottom">Thoſe parents who are at a loſs upon theſe points may conſult the Family Phyſician.—For Rhubarb, ſee p. 26,—Gaſcoign's Powder, p. 15—Magneſia, p. 19.</note>; but when diſorders do not give way to ſuch ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple methods, there is no time to be loſt. I beg leave therefore to caution parents, who can obtain the advice of an experienced prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner, not to depend upon their own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo far, as to ſuffer a continuance of complaints until they exceed the power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Delays are always dangerous, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to diſeaſe, even in grown perſons; but they are much more ſo in children, becauſe they have not equal ſtrength, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſooner ſink under bodily infirmities.</p>

            <head>LETTER XII.
The neceſſity of cultivating the diſpoſitions of children, to render them amiable and virtuous.</head>
            <p>CONFESS, ye worthy parents who know the height of earthly bliſs, what temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in life could prevail upon you, after two or three years of age, to part from the dear dear offsprings of your mutual loves? Ye tender mothers, ſpeak! I generouſly applaud an affection thus fondly rivetted in the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male breaſt, and anſwer for you, ladies, that nothing upon earth could prove equivalent to ſuch a loſs. Ten thouſand ſoft enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments bind them to your very ſouls.</p>
            <p>This is the time in which their little fond endearments begin to operate; their every action is wonderfully engaging, and their pretty liſping tongues are one univerſal har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. How exquiſite is the delight to view their expanding minds—now catching ſound, that quickly riſes into ſenſe, beaming a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py proſpect of future underſtanding! Here the volume of man begins—even at this time
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:024796_0111_0FC88E3D9D285B00"/>the fertile genius glows. How tranſporting is their ſweet ſenſibility!</p>
            <p>O powerful Nature, how unſpeakably ſtrong are thy ties! What heart, unleſs ſtrangely perverted, can reſiſt thy impulſe? Hence ariſes the unſpeakable difference of a laudable and virtuous paſſion, compared with an unchaſte and vicious life. My God! that met ſhould waſte their health and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in the ſtews with harlots, rioting in obſcene and brutal pleaſures, where the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional being is ſunk even below pity!</p>
            <p>Such conduct, in the cooler hours of thought, if ever they reflect, muſt cauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but anguiſh and remorſe; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, by cultivating a chaſte and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble love, ſuch wretched libertines might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the joyful parents of little ſmiling fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. What an alternative is this! Be dumb, ye lawleſs rovers; it is an enjoyment beyond your comprehenſion, for virtuous minds alone can reliſh it.</p>
            <p>What numbers of debauchees, in different climes and ages, worn out by guilty intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, mournfully lament their curſed fate, in not being bleſt with an heir to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to their half-ruined fortunes! Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Providence! thus to diſappoint them —for what but impurity and diſeaſe could they give birth to? Happy, thrice happy decree of Nature, that virtue alone can claim a ſmiling and a healthful progeny.</p>
            <p>This is a theme worthy of an abler pen.
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:024796_0112_0FC88E3F1870AB08"/>How often has prattling innocence diſarmed the rugged fierceneſs of a brutiſh nature, and melted down the rage of paſſion into more than female ſoftneſs! How often, I ſay, by theſe means is a man of wrath inſenſibly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into tenderneſs and love! I muſt tear myſelf away from the digreſſion: ſhould I indulge my zealous inclination, a volume of panegyric would fall ſhort of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>The human mind, in its infant opening, has been juſtly compared to a blank ſheet of paper, ſuſceptible of every impreſſion: whence it may be ſuppoſed, children receive their prejudices and inclinations from the diſpoſitions of thoſe perſons to whoſe care they are entruſted, in like manner as theſe letters convey the ſentiments of the author.</p>
            <p>That any children are born with vicious inclinations, I would not willingly believe. When I hear parents exclaiming againſt the bad diſpoſitions of their own children, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help oftentimes ſecretly condemning the parents themſelves, for introducing ſuch vices into their habits. Inſtinct, even in brutes, produces a tenderneſs for their young—a harmleſs ſociety amongſt their neighbours— a paſſive fear towards their enemies—and violence ſeldom is diſcovered but againſt thoſe animals which nature has appointed for their ſupport. Can we then imagine that a worſe than brutiſh fierceneſs ſhould be natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally diſcernible in our infant ſtate?—that
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:024796_0113_0FC88E46EA40D178"/>ſpite, malice, anger, and revenge, ſuch dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical paſſions, ſhould tyrannize before we are capable of ſelf-defence? The very ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſeems to me an arraignment of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the nobleſt part of the creation, and appears to be inconſiſtent with the juſtice of a benevolent Deity.</p>
            <p>It therefore behoves every mother to be watchful of her own conduct, and perfectly ſatisfied of the diſpoſitions of ſuch ſervants as ſhe entruſts with the care of her children, at this ſuſceptible time of life; when even the more affectionately theſe perſons treat them, the worſe conſequences are to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, if their own tempers are not good: for as children are gratefully fond of thoſe who uſe them kindly, they are by far the more likely to imbibe the bad qualities of an indulgent attendant; and, on the contrary, to profit by good examples.</p>
            <p>Objects that attract the eyes are the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting: the pleaſures from hearing are the next. From ſight and ſound ideas take their gradual riſe. Hence, a partial fondneſs is formed by children towards thoſe whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince it is to attend upon them: and for this reaſon they are more fond of their nurſes, who are conſtantly prattling to them, than of parents neglectful of their infancy.</p>
            <p>The want of duty and affection in children towards their parents, ſo much to be cenſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo generally complained of, often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from this early miſmanagement. The
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:024796_0114_0FC88E482EEC9E78"/>indifference alſo of too many parents towards their children, frequently owes its origin to depriving themſelves of the enjoyments of their little ones at this engaging ſeaſon of life. Even to an unintereſted perſon, the expand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an infant mind is a delightful entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but to good parents, the pleaſure and attachment muſt certainly prove exceedingly more agreeable and laſting. We muſt indeed pity thoſe whom neceſſity deprives of this happy ſolace, but utterly condemn ſuch whoſe inclinations drive their little nurſlings from them. Unnatural and miſtaken perſons, who, if they are puniſhed with undutiful children, ſuffer only in conſequence of their own ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect!</p>
            <p>Would you, my tender and conſiderate ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons, wiſh to ſee your children truly amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Be then ever careful of yourſelves. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour alſo as much as poſſible to prevent violent exceſs of paſſion in your huſbands. This is a laudable taſk, and much more in the power of women than they generally ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine. Truſt: me, my fair-ones, truly prudent and good wives, by bending a little to the rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, headſtrong, and boiſterous diſpoſitions of ſome huſbands, may for the moſt part ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilize them; and by their endearing and ſoothing manners, in ſpite of early vicious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, compel them to a behaviour of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and love. Thus, by the example of an engaging deportment on your part, you will ſoften their tempers, ſo as to render them
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:024796_0115_0FC88E499CAC35C0"/>good huſbands, good fathers, good maſters, and valuable members of ſociety.</p>
            <p>While, on the other hand, vindictive and peeviſh women not only forfeit this female importance, but too frequently eſtrange their huſbands' affections from them: and need I ſay that this want of harmony and ſincere friendſhip, between man and wife, is a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous pattern for their children?</p>
            <p>From the ſtrong force of example, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes in a manner natural to the children of ſuch perſons to give an unbridled looſe to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry impulſe; nay, their emulation is ſoon enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to become equally tyrannical with their parents. On the contrary, where no ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents are before their eyes—where impaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned and youthful love keeps pace with ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timental friendſhip—where the polite and well-bred man ſhows a virtuous inclination towards his wife; and they both join in a proper regard for their children—how much reaſon have we to expect that their young and tender minds will be impreſſed with virtue! Nay, I dare aver, that, from this rectitude of behaviour, ſuch parents will generally be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded with good and dutiful children.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the management of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, how ſhall we draw the line between in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence and ſeverity? Although they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ametrically oppoſite to each other, it is ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſible to be done; nay, it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, ſo as to admit of abſolute deciſion. Children neceſſarily require a different treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:024796_0116_0FC88E4B64AA5658"/>even from their natural diſpoſition, as it is uſually called; and a conduct indulgent to ſome, will prove the greateſt ſeverity to others. Let it therefore be remembered, that our plan is to ſubdue the firſt irregular emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the bud, ſo as to prevent them from riſing into paſſions.</p>
            <p>I would, then, at all events, earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend temper and forbearance to thoſe who have the government of their infant years. Kind treatment, good words, and a generous encouragement, to moſt diſpoſitions, will prove equal to every thing that you require of them; and if they can be conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſuch laudable and gentle means, you not only carry the firſt points in the moſt eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible manner, but accuſtom them alſo to an obliging behaviour, and excite their emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to endeavour to pleaſe.</p>
            <p>Carefully therefore obſerve every emotion that is praiſe-worthy, and let a reward accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany it; for the encouragement of one virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous impulſe will have a much happier effect than the correction of a hundred faults.</p>
            <p>Such are the impreſſions neceſſary to form a virtuous mind, and they will certainly grow up into their habits. On the contrary, where children's diſpoſitions are untoward; if they be ſubdued by harſh words, threats, and chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, how are their tempers ruffled by ſuch treatment!—and what is to be expected, but that they conſider ſeverity and violence as the only means for them to obtain any
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:024796_0117_0FC88E537399AFB0"/>point over others, whom they may have a future occaſion to contend with? What a wretched foundation of perpetual diſquietude!</p>
            <p>Where reproof is neceſſary, mortification is undoubtedly the beſt means of correction; and let an acknowledgment of the fault prove the means of reconciliation.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>"And, next to <hi>right,</hi> pray condeſcend</l>
               <l>"T' acknowledge doing <hi>wrong,</hi> my friend."</l>
            </lg>
            <p>This humbles them in their own opinions; it neceſſarily begets ſhame; and before a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is hardened into vice, ſhame will always produce amendment,</p>
            <p>Moreover, in this caſe there is no object for reſentment, that great ſupport of pride; conſequently it initiates them to conſider tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly their own conduct, and of courſe to dwell upon the cauſe for which they are thus humbled. What, therefore, can more tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly conduce to render children amiable as they grow up, than the accuſtoming of them to a retroſpection of their own behaviour, and to an inward condemnation of their faults, of which their making a conceſſion is ſufficient proof?</p>
            <p>Even in the moſt trifling promiſe a parent can make to children, I moſt earneſtly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that it be religiouſly adhered to; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you teach them a ſhocking leſſon of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.</p>
            <p>For equivocation and falſity, their mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations ought to be exceedingly ſevere; but
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:024796_0118_0FC88E54DEEA5E20"/>in every point where you find it neceſſary to correct be ſure you make them truly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their error: at the ſame time, in every miſdemeanor, be thoroughly ſatisfied that it proceeds from a culpable emotion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you reprove it; for it ſometimes falls out, that wrong actions may proceed from laudable intentions.</p>
            <p>How often in life does it happen, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions are taken againſt a friend, who is at that very time actually meditating the angry perſon's advantage; and yet, perhaps, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances ſo blind him that he thinks of nothing but revenge, until an eclairciſſement takes place, when he as paſſionately reproaches himſelf for his ingratitude! The caſe is ſtill harder with children; for, when they are pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed wrongfully, it is ſeldom that they have it in their power to clear themſelves; and further, they may probably ſuppoſe their own good emotions to be the guilty cauſe, and thereby endeavour to ſuppreſs a riſing virtue.</p>
            <p>Indulgence over much is liable to produce effects equally bad, as extreme ſeverity; for as the latter inures them to every act of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, ſo the former encourages the breach of every civil duty that thwarts their ſelfiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations.</p>
            <p>But the greateſt miſconduct of all ariſes from theſe two oppoſite ways of management being united together, in the wideſt extreme; when one moment the little creature's bones are almoſt broken for a fault of which it is
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:024796_0119_0FC88E5668C3D250"/>ſcarcely ſenſible, and the next moment it is fondly cheriſhed to reconcile it to the miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken parent; and in return, not improbably, indulged in exerciſing its rage upon toys, in torturing birds, dogs, cats, and ſuch-like do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic animals, as infant tyranny can lord it over; and permitted alſo at the window to ſport with the lives of little buzzing inſects, that fall a ſacifice to wanton cruelty.</p>
            <p>The child who is fondly and fooliſhly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged, promiſes only a melancholy proſpect; but where, on the other hand, as is too gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſeen, an occaſional ſeverity inures it to cruelty, the diſpoſition is inevitably ruined. The conſequences of ſuch ſeverity and ſuch indulgence fill the mind with every diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able apprehenſion: and indeed, what can they produce but inordinate deſires, brutiſh rage, and violence?</p>
            <p>Thoſe parents who are happy enough to ſubdue their own choler, and thereby ſet their children proper examples, will have very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle cauſe for complaint againſt them: on the contrary, ſuch as are perpetually quarrelling with each other, with their children, ſervants, and every body around them, cannot expect much peace and comfort from their riſing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. But if they will take this friendly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to correct their own errors only once, for every hundredth time they chaſtiſe others, it will probably bring about ſome amendment in themſelves; and the force of their example muſt ſurely produce the beſt effect upon their houſehold.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="129" facs="unknown:024796_0120_0FC88E580C5CD350"/>We have now conducted children through the different ſtages of helpleſs infancy, and gradually introduced them, though as yet but junior characters, upon the grand theatre of life; where the happy effects of ſuch careful regulations are generally to be diſtinguiſhed. As to literary improvements, they properly come under another juriſdiction, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore claim your future conſideration. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, a condeſcending obligingneſs, a ſweet affability, an unaſſuming ſenſibility, and a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt deportment, ever denote the proper edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a female mind. In like manner, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, abſtemiouſneſs, and virtuous diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in men, moſt frequently proceed from the good impreſſions of childhood. Severe ſtripes, and harſh uſage, add fuel to a turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and revengeful ſpirit, and too frequently render a ſullen boy malicious: on the other hand, the indulged and ſpoiled child common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turns out an abandoned libertine.</p>
            <p>Thus, my fair-ones, you may eaſily diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver how much ſociety is intereſted in your motherly conduct, at this early time; "for, as the twig is bent, the tree will grow;" and the ſeeds of iniquity, in thoſe diſpoſitions where virtue is not planted, unavoidably, as it were, take root, and ſpring up without much cultivation.</p>
            <p>Every notorious vice ſhows an utter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt for the moral duties of life; and the man whoſe character it infamous, ſeems but little to regard the opinion of others: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:024796_0121_0FC88E60F1ADBE30"/>the good fame and chaſtity of women be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his ridicule and ſport. Such men are continually aſſaulting their virtue, and aiming at their ſeduction. Of conſequence, the dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, who has never been curbed in the early impulſes of erroneous inclinations, will prove to be very little capable of ſubduing the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous paſſions of youth; which will not only hurry him on to his own ruin, but alſo too generally occaſion the diſgrace, infamy, and deſtruction of many unfortunate young women.</p>
            <p>Thus it appears, how greatly the happineſs and proſperity of the fair ſex are affected by the ſenſual miſconduct of ours; inſomuch that, in the preſent inſtance, women as well as men muſt fall degraded.</p>

Of milk—Its properties examined—the different kinds of milk compared with each other—and their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular virtues explained.</head>
            <p>MILK has been recommended, in ſeveral letters, as the proper food for infants; and in the fourteenth and fifteenth, it is again ſpoken of, as being equally neceſſary for inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids and aged perſons. It ſhall, therefore, be the buſineſs of this letter to examine ſo far into the qualities of milk, and into the milk of different animals, as may enable us to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what kind of milk is, upon different occaſions, to be preferred; which will take in every thing, not elſewhere obſerved upon this ſubject.</p>
            <p>Milk was before remarked to be a kind of white blood, prepared by the mother for the ſupport of her young; ſo far we may ſpeak of it in general terms.</p>
            <p>In different animals, therefore, it is reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuppoſe, and fact confirms our ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, that the qualities of milk are alſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent: hence, by firſt examining into its ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral properties, and, from thoſe principles,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:024796_0123_0FC88E649A53D288"/>ſetting forth the peculiar variations in the milk of different animals, we ſhall arrive at the deſired concluſion.</p>
            <p>In milk, by ſtepping into the dairy, we may diſcern three principal component parts. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it has remained ſome time in an undiſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtate, the cream floats upon the ſurface. It is the leaſt in quantity, though moſt nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of an oily balſamic ſubſtance, and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable in its nature, as the butter, which is made from it, plainly demonſtrates.</p>
            <p>A lady, before whom I once made ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, aſked me why the cream floated upon the ſurface; for being, continued ſhe, the thickeſt part, ought it not rather to ſink to the bottom? I told her, it was the thickeſt part, to be ſure, but at the ſame time it was alſo the lighteſt; ſpecifically ſo, as oil is light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than water, and therefore riſes to the top.</p>
            <p>The cream being taken off, the remaining milk appears bluiſh, and thinner than before; and when thus robbed of its thick, creamy part, it conſequently is not ſo ſmooth to the palate.</p>
            <p>On the addition of runnet, or indeed any acid, a ſeparation of the two remaining parts ſoon takes place, and we diſcover the curd. This, being the heavieſt, when ſeparated from the whey, falls to the bottom. It is the leaſt valuable part of the milk, glutinous in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and compoſed of the moſt earthy parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, being alſo of an aſtringent quality.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="unknown:024796_0124_0FC88E6B7017C098"/>The third and only remaining part, being the whey of the milk, is the largeſt in quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of a diluting and cleanſing property.</p>
            <p>Let us now by this ſtandard compare the different kinds of milk, moſtly in uſe with us, and apply them to the purpoſes for which they ſeem beſt calculated.</p>
            <p>The human milk, when drawn from the breaſt, has exactly the ſame bluiſh appearance as cow's milk when the cream is taken off. It affords very little cream, and but a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of curd; therefore the whey conſtitutes the chief part: but the more healthy the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is, and particularly if between the age of twenty and thirty, the more her milk abounds with rich creamy balſam, and the more it alſo contains of the curd or earthy particles; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably from her conſtitution being, at this time, in full vigour, and the digeſtive powers therefore more perfect.</p>
            <p>Theſe obſervations will point out the beſt ſubſtitute, where the breaſt is denied, and will likewiſe direct thoſe, who prefer wet-nurſing, in the choice of the propereſt perſon; for there is, in my opinion, an equal objection againſt the milk of a very young girl, as againſt that of a woman almoſt paſt child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing. The cleanſing quality, before taken notice of, in a breaſt of new milk, will alſo, together with reaſon and experience, ſhow the propriety of recommending thoſe women who have not been long delivered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="unknown:024796_0125_0FC88E6CDF741408"/>Aſs's milk is generally allowed to be the neareſt to the human, and, according to the above experiments, we find it ſo, abounding moſtly with whey, and having little of the cream or curd in it. Hence, after a ſevere fit of illneſs, where the body is much emaciated, and the ſtomach weak, or where the blood is loaded with ſharp, acrid humours, the cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing quality of aſs's milk deſerves a preference to that of any other animal which is uſed for this purpoſe. In conſumptive caſes, or where there is a ſlow, habitual fever, it is juſtly to be preferred, until ſuch time as the conſtitution may have gained a little ſtrength, when the more nouriſhing ought to ſupply its place.</p>
            <p>Mare's milk is eſteemed to be much the ſame as aſs's; but this, indeed, is in very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle uſe.</p>
            <p>Cow's milk comes next under conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This appears to be the richeſt and moſt nouriſhing of any of the brutes' milk here mentioned. It abounds with a great deal of cream; for, after ſtanding twelve hours, and being ſkimmed, it appears equal to any other milk. It contains alſo a large quantity of curd; and, after all, even the whey is by far more nutritious than any other.</p>
            <p>We obſerved that aſs's milk, in the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, moſtly reſembles the human. Why then not prefer that to cow's milk, for the food of children? I do not totally deny the uſe of this milk for that purpoſe; but in our part of the country, it is very expenſive, and
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:024796_0126_0FC88E6E9D9BB258"/>cannot be obtained in any large quantity; for which reaſon it would be impracticable to bring it into general uſe.</p>
            <p>There is, likewiſe, another reaſon which inclines me to give a preference to cow's milk; for, notwithſtanding the ſimilarity of human milk to that of aſſes, the firſt may well be ſuppoſed moſt ſtrengthening, ſince women uſually feed on animal as well as vegetable diet, while the brutes we ſpeak of are confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned entirely to vegetables. Whence, if we ſubſtitute aſs's milk, we ſhall fall ſhort of the nouriſhment nature deſigned for us; and therefore for a young child, who requires a heartening diet, the milk of cows, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is preferable, as the richneſs of it is, in ſome meaſure, adequate to the ſuppoſed dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the qualities of human milk, and that of other animals.</p>
            <p>The milk of ſheep and goats conſiſts moſtly of the curd, or earthy particles: hence, where the blood veſſels are injured by acrid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and frequent bleedings happen from this cauſe, or where children are ſubject to the rickets, from a weakneſs of the bones, that milk, which abounds moſtly with the curd, or cheeſy part, ſeems beſt calculated to anſwer the intention; its earthy, mucilagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and aſtringent property having the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt tendency to heal ſuch ruptured veſſels, and to give a firmneſs to the bones: but as theſe milks poſſeſs leſs of the cleanſing power, it will, in moſt caſes, particularly in bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:024796_0127_0FC88E709845EDA0"/>be proper to uſe the more attenuating kind firſt.</p>
            <p>We have now examined the different milks familiar to us, and, from their different pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, pointed out the end each ſort ſeems beſt calculated to anſwer; whence every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will quickly be determined which to give the preference to in particular complaints.</p>
            <p>When any one firſt begins to eat milk, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if a free liver, it may probably purge a little; but ſuch inconveniencies will moſt commonly be removed, by accuſtoming the conſtitution to the uſe of it; and boiling the milk will in a great meaſure prevent this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. I have always remarked, that thoſe, who, by reaſon of a pampered appetite, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of milk and vegetables being windy, and not agreeing with them, are the very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who moſt require ſuch a diet; for it is the debauched ſtate of the ſtomach and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, that occaſions their uneaſineſs, which this regimen ſeems the moſt likely to correct.</p>
            <p>I have recommended a little ſalt to be mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with milk, before it is given to children, if they are apt to throw it up curdled, and ſhall mention the experiment which induced me to give that advice; ſince it is equally worthy the attention of grown perſons, ſome of whom make this an objection to their eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing milk; as I am inclined to believe ſuch precaution will render it agreeable to moſt conſtitutions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="137" facs="unknown:024796_0128_0FC88E76E25A5F60"/>I put two ounces of milk, warm as it came from the cow, into a tea-cup, with a little common ſalt; I put the ſame quantity, of the like warmth, into another tea-cup, without ſalt; then dropping a very little diſtilled vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar into each, a hard curd preſently appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that milk which had no ſalt in it, while the other with the ſalt was ſcarcely altered.</p>
            <p>I tried the ſame experiment again, with a large tea-ſpoonful of runnet, and obſerved the milk, which had the ſalt in it, to continue in its fluid ſtate, while the other grew thick and turbid, and almoſt inſtantly ſeparated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to curds and whey. This laſt experiment an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the beſt, and is much more to our purpoſe than the former. From theſe hints, it ſeems reaſonable to conclude, that ſalt, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with milk, might equally prevent the too haſty curdling of it, where there is a great acidity in the ſtomach; in which caſe, the curdled milk, having too quickly aſſumed a ſolidity, becomes troubleſome; and becauſe it is not as yet deſigned to paſs into the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els for the office of nouriſhment, a part of this intolerable load is generally diſcharged by vomiting. Moreover, the ſtimulating qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſalt will greatly aſſiſt a weak digeſtion, and thereby facilitate the paſſage of the milk from the ſtomach into the bowels; and from experience, in recommending it to children who uſed to throw up their milk in a curdled ſtate, I am convinced of its utility.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="unknown:024796_0129_0FC88E781FFC9940"/>In all caſes, where infirmities or age re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a prudent regimen, I have directed a ſimilar care to that of dieting children. Milk, therefore, comprehends a very material part of ſuch food; and I am fully perſuaded, that, if it were more univerſally uſed, the world in general would be greatly benefited. I do not, however, mean to be underſtood, that I debar thoſe from a reaſonable quantity of ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal food, who are capable of digeſting it. But ſuch as are emaciated by illneſs, or have the misfortune to labour under gouty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; ſuch, alſo, as are conſumptively in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, or thoſe who have crazy, infirm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and are ſubject to an habitual fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh diſpoſition, will do right to eat fleſh only once in the day, and, for the reſt of their nouriſhment, to live almoſt, if not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, upon milk.</p>

            <head>LETTER XIV.
The ſick chamber—with directions alſo for invalids.</head>
            <p>WE are now, my dear ladies, entering into the ſick chamber, in which, as well as in the nurſery, many amiable characters may be drawn. Here, the conjugal affection of a wife is laudably diſplayed—the tender love of a mother fondly exerts itſelf—the gratitude and duty of a daughter are conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous—the good ſiſter alſo endears herſelf to a worthy brother—and female friendſhip wears a thouſand additional charms!</p>
            <p>Let us picture a truly tender and good wife, in this exalted character! Let us ſuppoſe, that ſhe has deſerved recompenſe, by reſtoring to her chaſte and longing arms the diſtinguiſhed choice of her youthful love, ennobled by a generous ſympathy of virtuous inclinations!</p>
            <p>Let us imagine this happy man perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from a dangerous and painful illneſs; to which recovery her unwearied attendance proved greatly inſtrumental: his mind, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, impreſſed with every thought a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:024796_0131_0FC88E7B39376278"/>of ſuch an obligation can inſpire! Behold the huſband admiring her tranſcendant excellency; while the honeſt tear, perchance, trickling down his check, betrays the big e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion of a grateful heart. "She, on her part, with looks of cordial love, awhile in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent rapture glows—then on bended knees adores her Maker"—returns moſt fervid thanks, for that her prayer of ſorrow has been heard, that He has graciouſly reſtored the huſband and the father! How great muſt be their reciprocal felicity!</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to thoſe inſtructions which are neceſſary for the proper execution of this friendly office. There is a certain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence frequently proceeding from lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble motives, which, nevertheleſs is totally culpable: I mean, the deſire of our acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to viſit a ſick chamber. It is oftentimes, I acknowledge, the effect of tenderneſs, ill-placed, and a real concern, imprudently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. In general, thoſe viſits ſhould not be permitted. I every day experience the ill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of chem. When, indeed, a patient is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the recovery, and capable of ſitting up three or four hours at a time, the company of a friend, who knows how far to engage with propriety in converſation, is a ſweetly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing ſolace: but locks, bolts, or bars can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be too ſtrong to keep prating goſſips, at all times, out of a ſick chamber.</p>
            <p>During a fever, it is a load ſufficient for any patient to bear the diſeaſe. Quietude on
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:024796_0132_0FC88E82A0B38D30"/>his part, and ſilence on the part of thoſe about him, ought univerſally to be impoſed. It is not a time for the mind to be engaged either in the purſuit of buſineſs or pleaſure.</p>
            <p>This leads me to a conſideration of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt importance; and as I am not ſpeaking as a phyſician, but as a friend, it comes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly within that province, and I hope it will be ſeriouſly attended to by every reader. If it is now prejudicial for any one to think, even of the common concerns of life, how much more injurious muſt it prove, to have the mind engaged in that great work of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling, forever, our worldly affairs!</p>
            <p>Would you, my rational friends, wiſh to be freed from an intolerable burden, never poſtpone this important buſineſs until you are upon a bed of ſickneſs. Not to ſay how inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable the judgment at ſuch a time will often prove, perhaps to the detriment of ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving friend, or not unlikely to the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a whole family, the very mention of it from any one about us, or the conſcious neceſſity in ourſelves, muſt exceedingly hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and depreſs the ſpirits, when tranquillity and ſupport are eſſentially neceſſary: for what can ſuch an idea convey, but death?— A laſt will and teſtament is one of the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn acts of life, and ought never to be poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poned till the agonizing moments of death.</p>
            <p>The chamber, proper for a patient, is of no ſmall moment. There ought to be a free cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation of air, whether it be in the ſummer
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:024796_0133_0FC88E841D4F9210"/>or winter. I never would have any perſon confined to a room without a chimney; it is equally neceſſary in the warmer ſeaſon for the purpoſe of diſcharging the offenſive va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours of diſeaſe, as it is in cold weather, by means of a little fire, to bring the air to a due temperament, which alſo contributes to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the like offence.</p>
            <p>To you, my female friends, this concern of nurſing belongs. It is an important, and oftentimes a fatiguing taſk. I would willingly engage you in it upon principle, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall endeavour to ſhow that man and woman were born for each other's ſupport and comfort. Their reſpective dependence upon each other is, undoubtedly, the wiſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Omniſcience.</p>
            <p>I cannot ſpeak of this mutual obligation, without being mindful of the beautiful paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in our immortal Milton's Paradiſe Loſt, book the fourth, where Eve gives Adam an account of herſelf; and I ſhall introduce the deſcription at length, as a quotation from this author can never be deemed impertinent. Let us attend to the mother of mankind!—</p>
            <lg>
               <l>To whom thus Eve reply'd. O thou! for whom</l>
               <l>And from whom I was form'd; fleſh of thy fleſh;</l>
               <l>And without whom am to no end; my guide</l>
               <l>And head! what thou haſt ſaid, is juſt and right.</l>
               <l>For we to him indeed all praiſes owe,</l>
               <l>And daily thanks; I chiefly, who enjoy</l>
               <l>So far the happier lot, enjoying thee</l>
               <l>Pre-eminent by ſo much odds; while thou</l>
               <l>Like conſort to thyſelf canſt no where find.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="143" facs="unknown:024796_0134_0FC88E8617FF6AD8"/>That day I oft remember, when from ſleep</l>
               <l>I firſt awak'd, and found myſelf repos'd</l>
               <l>Under a ſhade, on flowers; much wond'ring where</l>
               <l>And what I was, whence thither brought, and how.</l>
               <l>Not diſtant far from thence, a murmuring ſound</l>
               <l>Of waters iſſued from a cave, and ſpread</l>
               <l>Into a liquid plain, then ſtood unmov'd,</l>
               <l>Pure as th' expanſe of heav'n: I thither went,</l>
               <l>With inexperienc'd thought, and laid me down</l>
               <l>On the green bank, to look into the clear</l>
               <l>Smooth lake, that to me ſeem'd another ſky.</l>
               <l>As I bent down to look, juſt oppoſite</l>

               <l>Bending to look on me; I ſtarted back,</l>
               <l>It ſtarted back; but pleas'd, I ſoon return'd:</l>
               <l>Pleas'd it return'd as ſoon, with anſwering looks</l>
               <l>Of ſympathy, and love: there I had fix'd</l>
               <l>Mine eyes till now, and pin'd with vain deſire,</l>
               <l>Had not a voice thus warn'd me, "What thou ſeeſt,</l>

               <pb n="144" facs="unknown:024796_0135_0FC88E874F120458"/>To illuſtrate my argument of our mutual dependence, I muſt beg leave to indulge my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and hope likewiſe to entertain my read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, with another quotation from the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. Adam, deſirous of retaining the angel Raphael, relates to him what he remembers, ſince his own creation, and among other things, that which is to our purpoſe, his firſt meeting and nuptials with Eve. After re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting his dream, wherein he was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of her creation, he proceeds:—</p>
            <lg>
               <l>I wak'd</l>
               <l>To find her, or forever to deplore</l>

               <l>When out of hope, behold her! not far off;</l>

               <l>Of nuptial ſanctity, and marriage rites:</l>
               <l>Grace was in all her ſteps, heav'n in her eye,</l>
               <l>In every geſture, dignity and love!</l>
               <l>I over-joy'd, could not forbear aloud.—</l>

            <p>How exquiſitely charming are theſe deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions! what valuable portraits of the firſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man pair! The lines elegantly ſtrong! the colourings beautifully rich! Then again the amazingly ſoft and delicate touches of this great maſter of the human feelings, wherever we caſt our eyes, enchantingly appear!</p>
            <p>What can more fully ſhow our mutual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence!—So amiably engaging to each other, our firſt parents, in this poem, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, that the labour of either, whereby the other was benefited, muſt prove a real pleaſure. What an example for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of matrimony!—O that we could more generally diſplay the character of Adam! Then you, my fair-ones, would ſtrive more ardently, in gentleneſs and love, to imitate this firſt of women.</p>
            <p>If man would endeavour to curb unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful inclinations, cheriſhing and comforting the wife of his boſom; if he would fondly
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:024796_0138_0FC88E8D18B24BD0"/>regard her charms and virtues; what emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation muſt ſuch a conduct excite in every female breaſt—to give honour and dignity to her huſband! Let men but begin the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and I will be accountable for the right behaviour of the generality of your ſex.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, the culpableneſs of man will not excuſe the folly of woman; and this piece of advice, from a real friend, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies will do well to obſerve.</p>
            <p>I know my fair pupils will tell me, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though a huſband may have follies and vices, yet, if he is but a ſenſible man, they can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look them, and cheerfully ſubmit to their lord and maſter—but who, ſay they, can be governed by a fool?</p>
            <p>When once a woman has drawn her lot, it is not only her duty, but the height of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, to make the beſt of it. Let her choice prove ever ſo diſagreeable, or ſuppoſing that ſhe was led into ſuch a marriage by the cruel compulſion of her friends, ſtill honour and obedience are required on her part. By giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing importance to an huſband, (even thoſe huſbands we are now ſpeaking of, for others will command it) a wife merits, and gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally obtains, praiſe and adoration, not only from him, but from the whole world.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, the miſtaken ſhe, who in company degrades, and upon every occaſion tauntingly reproaches her huſband, thus making him, poor man, the contemptible
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:024796_0139_0FC88E92EC7AD740"/>but to level her triumphant ſhafts at; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding ſhe imagines her own wit and ſuperior talents are happily diſplayed, to the entertainment and admiration of her friends; believe me, ladies, by thoſe very friends ſhe muſt ever be condemned; and let her merits, in other reſpects, be ever ſo great, this culpable part of her behaviour they moſt aſſuredly deſpiſe.</p>
            <p>But to return from our preſent wander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which I intentionally followed as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to virtue, a conſiſtency of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and mutual love; being convinced that theſe qualifications will make even a conſtant attendance in a ſick chamber not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unpleaſing. Now then let us purſue our further care, where female tenderneſs can aſſuage the ſevereſt bodily pains, and render the greateſt misfortunes of life at leaſt ſupportable.</p>
            <p>In every diſorder, phyſic and good nurſing ought to go hand in hand; and I am the more deſirous of giving my opinion with reſpect to good nurſing, as I mean to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to poor and bad nurſing, which has been too much the unlucky and miſtaken practice of the ſick chamber: for under the vague idea of inflammation, and inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory diſeaſes, even bread and water have been ſometimes accounted too great a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port for the patient. But with pleaſure, we now ſee phyſicians act upon more rational principles; and I would wiſh to convince
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:024796_0140_0FC88E93DAD3E798"/>you, ladies, whoſe province it is, of the propriety of ſupporting patients under every diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>The ſick chamber is our ſubject; but it is alſo to be underſtood, that the precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions here laid down will prove equally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, where invalids are permitted to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the common affairs of life; for, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a prudent regulation in our method of living, few conſtitutional or long-exiſting ails can be removed, or even rendered in any degree light, and eaſily to be borne; but I am clearly convinced, that it is very poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for many infirm perſons to paſs comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably through a tolerable length of life, and, at laſt, to pay an eaſy debt to nature.<note n="*" place="bottom">It would be ſwelling this letter to a very great bulk, were I to enter into a particular account of the diet proper for invalids. The reader who is under the neceſſity of obſerving ſuch a prudent reſtraint, is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore referred to my obſervations upon diet, in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily Phyſician: ſome hints of this kind are there thrown out, which he may probably conſider as not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unworthy of his attention.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The obſervations, therefore, upon chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and aged perſons, are equally applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to thoſe who, by ungoverned paſſions and intemperance, have ruined their health; for in either of theſe caſes, where the bodily powers are enervated, and the digeſtion weakened, a proper, light, and nouriſhing diet is as neceſſary to reſtore health, as it is to ſupport the young, and preſerve the aged.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="unknown:024796_0141_0FC88E967400B2C8"/>Every diſeaſe is to be conſidered as a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation from health; and a fever is the means made uſe of by Nature to free the body from ſomething that is noxious. Ought, we, therefore, to counteract her in this her own great work? Ought we not rather cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly and prudently, like a valuable hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, to tend upon her movements, and generouſly ſupport her in the deſign ſhe aims at? Surely this appears to every one rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable.</p>
            <p>However, where there is a fever, or great weakneſs of the body, or where the body itſelf is emaciated, an alteration from the common manner of living is certainly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. To theſe points, therefore, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine my advice, as other conſiderations come under a medical direction.</p>
            <p>Few perſons are conſtrained to keep their chambers, who are not troubled with great loſs of ſtrength, or feveriſh complaints; either as the firſt cauſe, or as ſymptoms ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying other diſeaſes. Suppoſing then theſe circumſtances, the conſtitution being thus reduced, or Nature labouring to throw off a diſeaſe, the body certainly requires a nouriſhment of the moſt ſimple kind; by ſimple, I mean eaſy of digeſtion, but let it at the ſame time be comfortable. The ſtomach and bowels muſt, of neceſſity, be equally af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the other parts of the body, and conſequently unable to perform their offices upon the common ſupports of life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="unknown:024796_0142_0FC88E979AF5C390"/>Animal food, therefore, is particularly to be forbidden: and I am ſorry to be obliged to blame the fondneſs of parents, and thoſe who aſſiſt in ſick chambers, for too frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indulging patients thus unwarrantably. Give me leave to obſerve, if fleſh be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted during the exiſtence of a fever, or when the body, by illneſs, is exceedingly weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and emaciated, from the incapacity of the digeſtive faculties, the nouriſhment produced muſt be imperfect, crude, offenſive; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, inſtead of a ſupport, muſt add an additional weight to the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>But, at the ſame time, let it be remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that, as a ſupport is neceſſary, good broths, wine whey, jellies, panado, a beverage of wine and water, &amp;c. are to be diſcretionally permitted; and indeed the inclination of the ſick perſon will generally determine the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of theſe things; for where they are hurtful, an univerſal loathing of them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly takes place.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and ſuch like ſippings, being eaſy of digeſtion, are not only the propereſt for a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed ſtate of the ſtomach and bowels, but they alſo ſupply the body with a neceſſary nouriſhment to uphold its ſtrength under the diſorder. It is a point at preſent acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all good phyſicians. It is, in my opinion, a circumſtance minutely to be dwelt upon; for woful experience has often convinced me, that the raſhneſs of an obſtinate nurſe, in one unlucky hour, has counteracted the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:024796_0143_0FC88E99D849BE30"/>of a well-regulated, and otherwiſe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful, regimen.</p>
            <p>Although I would debar patients from ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal food, where there is a feveriſh complaint, nevertheleſs I do moſt earneſtly recommend a generous, but diſcretionary, ſupport of eaſily digeſted and comfortable liquid nouriſhment, in every fever. I mean, that barley-water, mint and balm tea, with ſuch like drinks, will not ſufficiently ſupport the ſtrength of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient under any kind of fever, even for a few days, and much leſs for as many weeks. As to the diſtinctions of inflammatory, nervous, and putrid, it is not my buſineſs to enter upon them here; but ſuppoſing the fever to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory, the patient is, or ought to be, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to bed, and a breathing ſweat encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. Will not then an already almoſt digeſted and innocent liquid nouriſhment anſwer the phyſician's aim, at the ſame time that it ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the patient? Experience has convinced me of its utility. I cannot help, therefore, ſtrongly recommending it; for I am too ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive that many lives are daily loſt for want of this neceſſary ſupport.</p>
            <p>I am labouring to prevent that miſtaken care, which is commonly called ſtarving a diſeaſe, and to ſet aſide the dreadful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion that a little innocent nouriſhment gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to a perſon in a fever, is ſtill adding fuel to the fire. By theſe errors the ableſt aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance is oftentimes baffled, to the coſt of the patient; and, not unlikely, to the diſgrace of
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:024796_0144_0FC88EA057219D98"/>a worthy practitioner. Be aſſured, that it is more eligible to endeavour to ſupport, and build up again, a ſhaken, diſeaſed, and totter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frame, than to attempt to pull it down. Never let this be done but by the expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of wiſdom and experience; for it is a ſerious affair at all times to deprive a tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its foundation and ſtrength. It is much to be wiſhed, as it ſurely muſt prove a general advantage, that phyſicians would more particularly direct the regimen of diet in ſick chambers.</p>
            <p>The punctuality of nurſes, and thoſe who attend upon the ſick, in the adminiſtering of medicines, is of no ſmall import. It is a cruel reflexion upon the honeſt part of the profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that practitioners conſult the number of their fees, or the length of their bills, more than the health of their patients. Such ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity is but very ſeldom, I hope, if ever, prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed; and as few perſons employ any but thoſe of whom they entertain a good opinion, let me warn you, as a friend, not to indulge a ſuſpicion which betrays a mean ſoul, and moſt probably will, at ſome time or other, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce fatal conſequences to yourſelves. Great relief, nay, oftentimes, perfect health, is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly to be obtained by the help of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. Great evil, nay, too frequently, certain death, enſues from a jealous contempt, or wanton neglect of this ſalutary aid.</p>
            <p>I muſt ſpeak of another miſtake, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the management of linen. A patient
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:024796_0145_0FC88EA2C7FE7A70"/>cannot be hurt by changing wet, filthy, and offenſive linen, for that which is dry, clean, and comfortable; provided this be done with proper care, not to give cold during the time of ſhifting the clothes. Linen which is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly dry and clean is, at all times, to be preferred to that which has been uſed; for the latter may have abſorbed offenſive va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, of which the former muſt be entirely free. Againſt this obſervation, I am convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there are great prejudices; nevertheleſs thoſe who employ their reaſon but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will ſee the propriety of the preſent caution.</p>
            <p>A free ſucceſſion of air is eſſentially neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry not only to carry off the offenſive vapours of diſeaſe, but alſo to the recovery of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient; nay, even to the preſervation of thoſe who attend upon the ſick. It is true that a fire is proper in cold weather, for reaſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore given; but at the ſame time the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber ought to be no more than comfortably warm; for where this degree of heat is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, faint ſweats are likely to exhauſt the patient's ſtrength, whereby he ſinks, perhaps, under a diſeaſe, through which, probably, he might otherwiſe have been ſupported.</p>
            <p>Having now cautioned you againſt the moſt material errors, which, at preſent, occur to my memory, I will beg leave to obſerve what poor creatures men in general are, when ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity confines them to a ſick chamber! If we reflect upon this ſcene, ought we to complain
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:024796_0146_0FC88EA3A4487F78"/>of the ſpirits of women? I ſcarcely ever find a man, in ſickneſs, ſupport himſelf ſo well as a woman does. Men are, for the moſt part, depreſſed in their ſpirits, to the greateſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, when they are ill. Be it then with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude remembered, that in a ſick chamber, the pleaſing vivacity, and, let me add, the true philoſophy, of a kind female friend, prove eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially neceſſary. A good nurſe will, in a great meaſure, alleviate our bodily infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, by ſupporting our ſpirits in time of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>A man, by ſtriking and ſuperior abilities, induſtry, and good fortune, is ſometimes luc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ky enough to raiſe himſelf, aggrandiſe his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, and bring to his wife conveniencies far beyond her expectations. But what are all theſe things, compared to the comfort, and tender ſupport, which ſhe in return can largely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon him; at a time too when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of nature will not ſuffer ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted favourite of fortune to reliſh any one enjoyment of life? Aſk this very darling, when he is ſtretched on the bed of ſickneſs, and rendered helpleſs by diſeaſe;—let us fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy him too almoſt expiring under excruciating agonies—and now put the queſtion to him, Which is more eligible, fortune or health? He will aſſuredly anſwer, that one moment's eaſe is more deſirable than all the ſplendid ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages he may have obtained.</p>
            <p>In like manner, the truly affectionate and ſympathiſing concern, the delicate deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:024796_0147_0FC88EA51FF47350"/>and careful attendance of a good wife, in theſe ſcenes of painful ſufferance, more than over-balance every thing that is in the power of the moſt ſucceſsful huſband to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow upon her; and it is a truth which truly generous minds will ever gratefully acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>A man under theſe circumſtances, with ſome regard to his accuſtomed manner of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the particular diſeaſe, is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a child; and conſequently ought to be ſubmitted to female management. Your care, therefore, will of courſe direct you to ſeek the aſſiſtance of able and experienced phyſicians. May their ſkill conquer the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, while you generouſly ſupport his ſtrength and ſpirits; and thereby greatly contribute to reſtore again the invalid to a healthy and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous conſtitution!</p>

               </gap> of a well-ſpent life; at which time, being likewiſe the winter of our days, every perſon may gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally reap the fruits of a paſt virtuous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct:—for although the benumbed limbs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the body their uſual ſupport, and the hoary head trembles on its withered ſhoulders, there are valuable comforts yet in ſtore for thoſe, who, like the induſtrious ant, have been wiſe enough to treaſure them at the proper ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Such a good man or woman, one would hope, has wherewithal to procure the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgencies
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:024796_0149_0FC88EAE408243A8"/>their years require, and a ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to requite the attendance of a faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant. Join to theſe a further bleſſing, that, perchance, kind Heaven has beſtowed, a dutiful and good daughter to ſupport their infirmities, and, by her affectionate tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs fully to repay them for the pains of her education, and that parental anxiety, which muſt neceſſarily have been ſuſtained during her youth. Here, I ſay, the wiſdom and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der indulgence of a kind parent is amply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, by the foſtering care of a truly vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and affectionate child. Theſe are ineſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timable comforts; and ſuch is the eaſy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline that Providence intended to old age— thus to cloſe life with a not unhappy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod.</p>
            <p>Let us, my amiable friends, picture a worthy and aged man in his ſecond infant ſtate. Let us with compoſure attend him to the gates of death, there to deliver him up into the boſom of his Creator! Let us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge a rational ſorrow, but at the ſame time ſupport that calmneſs and ſerenity which denote a religiouſly-informed mind. Let us conſider this as a debt we muſt aſſuredly pay, and that it puts an everlaſting period to the calamities of this life! Whence may be drawn this comfortable concluſion; that, if to the uttermoſt of our power we have contributed to the great end for which we were created, our future ſtate of exiſtence muſt be happier than the preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="unknown:024796_0150_0FC88EB2943EA9B8"/>Come then, ye tender and ſympathiſing fair, let us approach the chamber of death! Let us advance to the bed of this good pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, and behold his calm and reſigned coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance! Although we ſhall find it a ſolemn ſcene, yet there is nothing ſo terrible in this ſight as the world generally imagine. But draw the contrary character, that of a wicked man in his laſt moments; and it muſt be ſhocking indeed.</p>
            <p>As ripened and mellow fruit drops, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touched, from the tree to its mother earth; ſo the good old man falls peaceably into the grave, and mingles again with the common duſt from which he originally ſprang.</p>
            <p>It is the vicious alone that have reaſon to be terrified at the thoughts of death; but we are deſcribing the upright man, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely taking a laſt and affectionate farewell of his lovely and dutiful daughters; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting them to the practice of virtue, and recounting the rewards attendant upon it. The eldeſt, perhaps, in her willing arms ſupports the expiring fire, while the youngeſt adminiſters ſome refreſhing cordial to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, for a moment, the fleeting ſpirit. Mean while the tranquil parent, peradventure, gently rebukes the falling tear, prophetically foretelling that their laſt moments ſhall be peaceable like his—and bleſſes them with his dying lips.</p>
            <p>For ſuch characters, delineated more at large, and which are worthy of our admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:024796_0151_0FC88EB35FCA1790"/>and reverence, I muſt refer my gentle readers, for the female one, to that great maſter of human feelings, mr. Richardſon, in his hiſtory of ſir Charles Grandiſon. How beautifully is honourable age exemplified in the character of mrs. Shirley! The account there given of the latter part of her life will aſſuredly delight and inſtruct every one. The death of lady Grandiſon, how inexpreſſibly intereſting! Although her temples were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with untimely ſnow, yet, in the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of wife, parent, and chriſtian, her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted virtue had ſhone unrivalled; and when the awful period approached, behold her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, like the ſetting ſun,—leaving huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, children, and a world of friends, to mourn the eternal abſence of her cheering rays!</p>
            <p>The whole work contains a noble ſyſtem of morality, and is highly to be recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all young perſons. Theſe uſeful leſſons will be ſtill more inſtructive, when read in the company of thoſe who are capable of making proper remarks. This being premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, virtuous emulation will ever be moſt excited in young minds from characters which appear real, becauſe example always proves ſtronger than precept. Thus enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment and improvement will go hand in hand.</p>
            <p>For the other character, I mean that of the good old man, no one has excelled the ingenious and learned dr. Armſtrong, in his
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:024796_0152_0FC88EB51DE6D0D0"/>Eſſay upon health. The whole poem, indeed, is written in a maſterly ſtyle, and conveys many uſeful inſtructions, truly worthy of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal; but his deſcription of honourable age is inimitable; and although very conciſe, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs it contains a volume of panegyric. I ſhall beg that gentleman's leave to tranſcribe it.—</p>
            <lg>
               <l>How to live happieſt; how avoid the pains,</l>
               <l>The diſappointments, and diſguſts of thoſe</l>
               <l>Who would in pleaſure all their hours employ,</l>
               <l>The precepts here of a divine old man</l>
               <l>I could recite. Though old, he ſtill retain'd</l>
               <l>His manly ſenſe, and energy of mind.</l>
               <l>Virtuous and wiſe he was, but not ſevere;</l>
               <l>He ſtill remember'd that he once was young;</l>
               <l>His eaſy preſence check'd no decent joy.</l>
               <l>Him ev'n the diſſolute admir'd; for he</l>
               <l>A graceful looſeneſs when he pleas'd put on,</l>
               <l>And laughing could inſtruct. Much had he read,</l>
               <l>Much more had ſeen; he ſtudied from the life,</l>
               <l>And in th' original perus'd mankind.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Such characters render old age deſirable, lovely, and truly honourable. The odium of peeviſh and moroſe vaniſhes, while our reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and admiration ſtand alone engaged. Who would not wiſh to be that old man, whoſe calm tranquillity far ſurpaſſes the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient and paſſionate enjoyments of youth? Happy children bleſt with ſuch happy parents!</p>
            <p>From this deſcription I hope to intereſt the tender paſſions of my fair readers, ſo as to make them cheerfully contribute to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of their aged parents, while they yet live. A dutiful daughter muſt ever make a
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:024796_0153_0FC88EB8E287A920"/>good wife and tender mother; and to a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent diſcerning man, it is certainly one of the greateſt recommendations in the choice of a companion for life.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, a cruel and undutiful child is the moſt odious and unnatural mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter upon earth; inſomuch that the Chineſe are ſaid to puniſh ſuch crimes with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſeverity. It is recorded in their hiſtory, that if a ſon ſhould be known to kill, or ſo much as to ſtrike his father, not only the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, but his whole family, would be rooted out, their dwelling razed to the ground, and its foundation ſown with ſalt; nay, Le Compte adds, that the inhabitants of the place where he lived would be put to the ſword; as they conclude there muſt have been a total depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of manners in that clan, or ſociety of people, who could have bred up among them ſo horrid an offender.</p>
            <p>How beautifully has our inimitable Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare drawn the two contraſted characters, in his deſcription of Lear and his three daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; where the two elder appear like Satan's evil angels, while Cordelia, the poor Corde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, is an exalted example of filial tenderneſs and affection!</p>
            <p>To your peculiar province, ye amiable fair, is this laſt great duty conſigned: to inſtruct you, therefore, in the proper execution of it, a few uſeful obſervations may not be unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably introduced.</p>
            <p>In a former letter we likened infancy to a lender plant; where we taught the beſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:024796_0154_0FC88EBECDB892C0"/>of rearing it, ſo as to make it flouriſh in the garden of the world. The ſummer having produced you, the fair fruit of this goodly tree; and the autumn of your parent-ſtock having ripened your underſtanding; it is but meet that ſuch knowledge ſhould direct you, at this frozen ſeaſon, to cheriſh the decaying root from whence you ſprang.</p>
            <p>We have taken notice of the helpleſs ſtate of childhood, before the body has acquired ſtrength ſufficient to prepare its own nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: we have ſhown the time when inſtinct and reaſon direct us to provide for ourſelves; and particularly obſerved, that animal food was never deſigned for our uſe until we had teeth given us to eat it.</p>
            <p>Let us continue theſe ſpeculations, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the natural growth of our bodies, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the increaſing ſtrength of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions. Behold the child, whom you late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fondled in your arms, now contending with his play-fellows in boyiſh ſports: again, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him who lately returned from ſchool with his ſatchel in his hand, now panting fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in the chace: and now ſee manhood ſtamped upon the downy cheek. Let us like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe remember the equally gradual declenſion. At length the ſturdy ſon ſupports his feeble ſire; for he who, in his youth, was ſwifteſt in the race, is now ſcarcely able to uphold his tottering limbs. The man of war, whoſe ſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy arm wielded the blood-thirſting ſword of battle, is now bending under the weight of
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:024796_0155_0FC88EC01F9F3ED0"/>his own body. Behold, his ſinews are dried up, and the purple current that bounded in his veins, now heavily and ſcarcely creeps along. In every part alike the powers of this wonderful machine decay. The teeth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned both for uſe and ornament, robbed of their beautiful enamel, become unſightly, and drop out of their ſockets: the penetrating eye, that ſearched into the very abyſs of thought, is altogether uſeleſs, or but dimly diſcerns the rays of light. Manly fortitude is now no mere; and wiſdom itſelf retires from the decayed manſion. Such is the almoſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal condition of old age, properly called our ſecond childhood; and plain are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences to be drawn from hence.</p>
            <p>If a light and eaſily digeſted nouriſhment was neceſſary before our bodies had obtained their proper ſtrength, ſurely a ſimilar method of living is the moſt proper when they have loſt it; and therefore—the ſteps by which we mounted into life, are the eaſieſt and beſt paths to deſcend into the grave.</p>
            <p>The digeſtive powers of age are equally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebled with the members of the body; and, undoubtedly, the ſame reaſon that forbad the uſe of fleſh, before we had teeth, points out the neceſſity of gradually declining it as they decay. There are, indeed, ſome few perſons toothleſs who are not far advanced in life; but ſuch conſtitutions are generally feeble, and therefore the precautions are not unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to them,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="unknown:024796_0156_0FC88EC1D1976EE8"/>Theſe arguments being rightly underſtood, there will be little occaſion to enlarge upon this ſubject; as the directions for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of children, from the time of wean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, until they may be entruſted to the care of themſelves, comprehend every neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary inſtruction for the regimen of old age; and thoſe perſons act wiſely who conſider it as a ſecond childhood.</p>
            <p>I need not be more particular on this head, as few, I am perſuaded, will ſuppoſe this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to commence with themſelves, before it is neceſſary for them to conform to theſe rules.</p>
            <p>Age, undoubtedly, requires indulgence; but at the ſame time indolence creeps on it imperceptibly. Thoſe perſons ſuffer leaſt from pain, who rouſe themſelves to a ſtate of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity; and there are exerciſes well adapted even to advanced life: an additional warmth of covering is at this time neceſſary; yet thoſe act moſt prudently who do not accuſtom themſelves to very warm clothes, and very warm rooms, while they are capable of endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the variations of their natural climate.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, one remark muſt not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape our obſervation; I mean, the happy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of temperance through life: it not only prevents diſeaſe as we are upon our journey, but enables us to receive the intended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, and cordial ſupport, of wine, and other comfortable ſippings, in this time of need. Nature, in a temperate perſon, obtains freſh
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:024796_0157_0FC88EC5C5560B08"/>vigour and ſpirits from ſuch exhilarating jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but where the conſtitution has been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to exceſs, no advantage, in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of life, can be derived from their uſe.</p>
            <p>I have now fulfilled my preſent deſign; and through every letter have aimed at convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my obſervations in a rational and amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing manner; calculated, I hope, to pleaſe, at the ſame time that I wiſh to inſtruct. It is a topic, which, in different parts of it, has been handled by very able men; and yet has generally, I believe, been eſteemed a dry ſubject, particularly by the ladies, to whom it eſſentially belongs. This diſlike ſeems, probably, to have ariſen from the ſtyle not ſeeing ſufficiently void of terms of art; for the taſte, as well as the judgment, muſt be pleaſed, when we mean to encounter preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices, and to correct long eſtabliſhed er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors.</p>
            <p>It will give me a particular ſatisfaction, if I have ſo far ſucceeded in my undertaking, as that the preſent collection of letters may deſerve a place in the ladies library; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps this little volume may ſometimes prove the companion of the nurſery and ſick cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or even afford an hour's amuſement in a carriage.</p>
            <p>It is intended, my fair, to render your characters truly amiable; and I truſt will be received as a preſent from a ſincere friend to the ſex. Where tenderneſs, good-nature, ſenſe, and virtue, are beautifully blended in
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:024796_0158_0FC88ECBAAAB8DB0"/>a female form, our admiration and love are equally engaged; and where this proves to be the caſe, every man is, ſurely, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of contributing to the ſervice of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections ſo irreſiſtibly engaging—ſuch, at leaſt, is the reſolution of,</p>
