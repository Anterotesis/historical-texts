            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHENCE is it that the doctrine of the equality of man has so long been hidden from the human race? Shall we impute it to imbecility of mind, or to the necromancy and enchantment of political institutions? Man was created equal, and endowed with the powers of perception and ratiocination. Have these powers slept since the first existence of man? Has he not opened his eyes to the plainest facts that exist? If we survey his exterior and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior structure, we have no reason to infer a diversity in man. The doctrine that inculcates our descent from a common head, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies a recognition of the equality of man—The same equality per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vades the vegetable and animal kingdoms. It is true, that a large tree receives more support from the earth than a smaller one, but if the latter receives sufficient to support its physical existence, it is upon a footing of equality with the former; but man, feeble in his origin, and his mind destitute of ideas, has been passive to the first impressions made by friend or foe. There has not been want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men artful enough to take advantage of the weakness of his intellect. The mind tenacious of former, has been obstinate to the reception of new impressions—sunk into mental indolence and sloth, man has been the continual sport of fortune.</p>
            <p>The weak and ignorant have been the submissive dupes of the cunning and wicked. The latter lost to every sentiment of jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice have unfeelingly domineered over the former—Influence and power once acquired has been easily retained with a small portion of caution and deceit. Hence the arbitrary governments of the whole world, hence has it been that the faint, imperfect percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of liberty that history records, has easily been extinguished by the industrious agency of tyrants. The page of history relates a melancholy tale of the condition of the human race. From the earliest time, ignorance, stupidity, and bondage have been the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niform lot and condition of man; had he drank of the waters of Lethe, or been bathed in the Stygian pool, a more confirmed le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:028815_0004_0FDD500EA24A4A30"/>
of mind could not have existed, than has arisen from the arts of his equals and his fellows. It is true, poet's have feigned, and sung of a golden age, of a state of freedom, of a community, of goods and interests; but such a state has existed only in the poet's song, it is entirely beyond the ken of history—Neither the records nor the remains of ancient kingdoms, exhibit any marks of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The pyramids of Egypt are monuments of pride, folly and tyranny. A gleam of political light has at times broke in upon the benighted mind; but imposture tampering with ignorance, has almost always been successful in its extermination; the weak ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of liberty have been unable to withstand the overwhelming torrent of despotism—Liberty an alien and an out-law at courts, no one dare to admit the guest into their bosom; its votaries perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted and oppressed, have been glad to fly to the altars and sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuaries of despotism for safety. O! Unhappy man! Let us drop a tear upon the misfortunes of our predecessors and blot out their mistakes. Egypt as old a government perhaps as any on record, has left no trace of freedom; in the whole period of its kings and tyrants, we have no mention of any exertions for liberty, they are historied to be wise in the arts and sciences, but with knowledge as with power, it must have been monopolized by the few, and not imparted to the many; had it been otherwise, some notions of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty would have started into the informed mind. The Jews when confined in Egypt, were kept in profound ignorance, and although Moses was learned in all the learning of Egypt, he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted a small share of it to his countrymen; in delivering them from the tyranny of Egypt, he brought them under the bondage of a ceremonial law; their political institutions were not more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable to personal liberty, than the institutions of a less favored people. The invention of letters and the consequent increase of knowledge among the Grecian States, revived some ideas of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but as science was monopolized by their philosophical sects, no permanent change in political institutions followed.</p>
            <p>Moral truths by a perversion of intellect were far beyond the reach of vulgar apprehension, political discoveries were rare, and man condemned to unchangeable ignorance continued in perpetual slavery. The expulsion of the Tarquins from Rome, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of a republic was rather the effect of accident than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign—the same ideas and passions pervaded the citizens of Rome. The desire of military glory engendered in the reign of their mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, still existed in the people, and the abolition of the tyranny of its monarchs, was succeeded by that of its consuls. The factions of Patricians and Plebeians, continued with increased violence, and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028815_0005_0FDD500FEF300848"/>
the sovereignty, instead of being transferred from Tarquins to the people, existed in the patrician order. The republic was succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the bloody reign of the Caesars, those monsters of the human race. To the distruction of the Roman Empire, succeeded a long night of impenetrable darkness—The human mind bewildered in a maze of puerile and religious sophistry, sunk almost to the level of the brute creation; not the least glimpse of political light pervad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the mind. The thick gloom of superstition that over-spread Europe, intercepted every ray. Literature gradually declined, during the violent and imperious reign of the Caesars, and the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of the Goths and Vandals, extinguished both the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and spirit of literature and liberty. They who had been drove to the North, by the conquering sword of the Romans, now turned its point upon their conquerors; and Rome, once the glory and admiration of the world, became a scene of violence, anarchy and confusion. To the irruption of the Goths and Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, succeeded the unnatural and impious sovereignty of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy. This prolific fountain of corruption disgorged its pestilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial water over the whole European world; the poor benighted inhabitants drank largely of its draughts, and a universal sleep and death of mind, followed its soporiferous influence; genius expired, and liberty affrighted and appalled, fled from its sphere of influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The literature that survived the extirminating sword of the northern nations, was monopolized by the priesthood of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Pontiff; locked up in a dead language, inaccessible to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon understanding, the imperious priesthood profited, by the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of their disciples—Man lost, and bewildered in a maze of uncertainty and conjecture, blinded, followed the path marked by his imperious and deceitful guides. From the destruction of the Roman Republic, to the exertions of the Swiss, in the 14th centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, not a spark of liberty existed among nations, whose transactions history has recorded. The slothful progress of truth and science began to shed its optical influence over the drowsy inhabitants of Europe, when the Cantons of Switzerland, irritated by the rigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous administration of their Austrian governors, repelled their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and established their independence—This continues to be the most free and independent of all European nations. But from the establishment of liberty in this country, notwithstanding the astonishing improvements in every branch of science, they have made few, if any improvements in their political institutions. In many of their Cantons, aristocracy preponderates, and their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary troops are a reproach to a free government. The next ray of political light appeared in the establishment of the independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the United Provinces.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:028815_0006_0FDD5015B15420C8"/>
The invention of Printing, the most useful perhaps of all disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, opened a new avenue to the sciences. The mind as it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ideas, began to expand, its views were enlarged, and the inventors of printing, (the Dutch) immediately participated of its beneficial consequences. The reformation of religion by Luther, aided the progress of political truth. The daring spirit of Luther, in opposition to the Holy See, by the powerful influence of example, animated the politician as well as priest. The warm discussion of religious topics, infused elasticity and vigor into mind; and other branches of science participated of the benefits of freedom of thought and enquiry. The mind loosened from the chains of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing superstition explored with dauntless courage, the regions of political and religious science. The Dutch became sensible to the exactions and oppressions of their Spanish Governors, and they unanimously resolved to throw off their imperious yoke—By pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotic exertions, and the assistance of Elizabeth, they extorted a recognition of their independence; in the formation and opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their political institutions they experienced urgent embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rassments and defects, to remedy which they resorted to the misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble expedient of creating an hereditary Stadtholder; it distorted every republican feature of their government; it betrayed a want of political discernment, and the exertions of the patriots in 1787, manifested a conviction of their mistake. Their struggles were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual, but the progress and valour of the French arms, has lopped off this cumbrous, &amp; unnatural graft, from the tree of Dutch liberty. The next struggle for freedom began in England, under the reign of the infatuated and misguided Charles 1st. The citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of England, animated by the recent example of the Dutch, and irritated into revolt by the oppressive impositions of their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, openly opposed his authority. To particularize the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy events of those times, would exceed the limits I have assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this oration. The decapitation of their monarch; the treachery of Cromwell, and the restoration of the 2d Charles, are facts familiar to the public mind—Wearied with a civil war, and unskilled in political science, they were unable to remedy the evils which they felt and suffered; they gave up the cause of Republican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ism for lost, and submitted again to royalty. The commotions in England, deserve particular consideration; for although the spirit of liberty was smothered in that country, the first emigrants to this, retained their unction, and transmitted it from generation to generation, until it broke forth with increased vigor, in the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of America.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:028815_0007_0FDD5016AEF6FAD0"/>
But of all events in the history of man, the discovery of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca seems to be the most auspicious to freedom. It was at a time when Europe groaned under ecclesiastical and political oppression, when no hope was left to solace the woe of the vanquished; when all hopes, of the regeneration of Europe were cut off; when the scaffold streamed with the blood of its victims, and the measure of political iniquity was almost full, that Columbus discovered the new world; that fortunate event in the annals of time, opened a new and chearing prospect to the disciples of liberty. Had A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica continued an undiscovered country, is it probable that the energy of the French would have been roused to cut off their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant? Surrounded as they are by despotic States, would they have undertaken the arduous task of a revolution? Could they have supported their numerous fleets and armies necessary to maintain their ground against a host of combined and exasperated foes. The diminution of their agricultural productions in consequence of war, and the difficulty of obtaining supplies from their enemies, would have forbid the attempt.</p>
            <p>The discovery &amp; revolution of America, is unequivocally a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary prelude to the regeneration of Europe—and by a happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catenation of causes, the discovery of the one has led to a beginning regeneration of the other. Let us now take a nearer view of the revolution in America, that luminous aera of human happiness. Need I to inform you that a few centuries past, these verdant fields, and this delightful village, were a solitary desert, the resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of every venomous and hostile animal, and the abode of the still more ferocious savage; but a few revolving years has past, since our fore-fathers fled from the religious and political persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of European governments, to secure an asylum in which freedom of opinion, might not be fettered in wicked, selfish, and prostituted establishments. They encountered a tempestuous o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean; they encountered fatigue, poverty, disease, and every hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of human life. They voluntarily banished themselves from connections, friends, and every natal attachment; and with a perseverance, the natural offspring of uncontrouled liberty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted the gloomy desert into a blooming paradise. The early history of our country is full of wars with merciless savages who spared neither age, sex, or condition of life. Whose heart is so barred against every social impression, as not to commisserate their sufferings? Remote from all governmental assistance, unprotected by their mother country; on one side, a boundless ocean, and on every other hemmed in by hordes of savages, implacable in their nature, and whose determination was their total extirpation,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028815_0008_0FDD501842A63900"/>
Vigilance, industry and unanimity, were their only protection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when by labor and incessant toil, they had subdued the intractable nature of the soil, when they had ameliorated its appearance and made it a comfortable residence for man, and when they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered their inveterate foes (the savages,) a new and unexpected enemy, their mother country began to oppress them. They who before, had considered this country, as a place of banishment, only for the most infamous convicts, now began to look with a jealous and invidious eye on the growing wealth and prosperity of the new world. Transportation was no longer a punishment, but a blessing; for in this country where liberty and equality had as yet reigned, the means of subsistence were open to all—the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densome and oppressive impositions on the industry and commerce of Europe had not as yet withdrawn the scanty pittance from the labouring peasant and mechanic.</p>
            <p>England exhausted with wars to support an imaginary balance of power, while she weeped over an empty treasury, viewed with envy the affluent condition of the citizens of America. It excited the rapacity of her ministers. Eager to grasp the wealth which industry had acquired, they violated the chartered rights of her colonies.</p>
            <p>America penetrated their designs. They sought constitutional redress by loyal petitions to the throne and parliament; but am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition had marked her object, infatuation had seized the parliament, and an unwarrantable lust of domination goaded them to such measures as finally to produce a decided opposition to their author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. The monarch lured by the prospect of gain, and his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition fanned into a flame by artful treacherous, ministers was drawn into the same vortex with the parliament. Who among us but remembers the numerous oppressive acts of king and parliament? The <hi>Stamp act,</hi> the <hi>Tea act,</hi> the <hi>Boston port-bill act,</hi> were all le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate measures of despotic power. The king to reduce us to unconditional submission, cast us out of his protection; captured our seamen, and compelled them into a service against their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination and all the laws of a civilized people. Our citizens were subjected to be transported to England for a trial, torn from their relations and necessitated by very expensive means to estab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish their innocence, or suffer conviction.</p>
            <p>Who can contemplate the Boston massacre without emotions of horror and indignation, and who can contemplate the tyrannical nature of their acts of parliament, without an abhorrence for their dereliction of all principle? Legislation without representation, is, the greatest of all absurdities. But neither entreaties, petitions,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028815_0009_0FDD501C3607CD68"/>
nor remonstrances could prevail upon the stubborn obduracy of Britain; she was deaf to the calls of justice; she had hardened her heart in wickedness; had inured herself to view scenes of slaughter, carnage, and oppression without the least emotion, and nothing except unconditional submission and unlimited power could satiate her inordinate ambition. Resolved upon the fatal step, she transported her fleets and armies to reduce us to the laws of a despotic parliament. America, when no other hope was left, resolved to oppose force to force, and at the expence of every thing dear to life to maintain her independence or die in the attempt. She organized a Congress, enlisted an army, and our virtuous citizens, with ardor and enthusiasm relinquished their peaceful occupations for the noisy, painful, and dangerous scenes of a military life. Congress, when all hopes of reconciliation va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, resolved to publish the separation of America from Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. They stated the causes which led them to this painful mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, and on the 4th of July, 1776, published the following lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous and emphatic declaration:</p>
            <p>WE the Representatives of the United States of America in General Congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the World for the rectitude of our intentions do, in the name and by the authority of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare, that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, Free and Independent States—that they are absolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from all allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great-Britain, is and ought totally to be dissolved; and that as free and independent states, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, contract alliances, and to do all other acts and things, which independent states may of right do. And for the support of this declaration with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives, our fortunes and our sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred honor."</p>
            <p>The difficult and trying scenes we had to pass through, I hope has made an indelible impression upon the minds of a greater part of my audience. The arduous and gloomy campaign of 1777, I trust is still fresh in your remembrance. Burgoyne pushing with rapidity from the north; Clinton rushing from the south, and our army undisciplined, unclad and unfed, must have created the most dismal apprehensions in the patriot's breast. But when driven to the verge of dispair, when we had given up all for lost, when co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns of impenetrable smoke encompassed our dwellings and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veloped our horizon—when our fields were deluged with blood—
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028815_0010_0FDD501D8D974368"/>
when the air was rent with the thundering peal of cannon and the shrieks of the dying, and when our fate was suspended upon a mere incalculable possibility, then was our deliverance near.</p>
            <p>Can you forget that we shed the blood of our most invaluable citizens? Can you forget that a Warren and Montgomery fell? The bare remembrance of the dangerous precipices from which we escaped, and the plots and machinations of our adversary, must excite gratitude in the most unfeeling heart. The bare re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the dismemberment of families, and the tender sympathies that were cut off, must wring a tear from the eye of the most ferocious and inhuman soul. But shall I draw a veil over these transactions and direct your attention to a period of peace and felicity, the peace of 1783. England exhausted with a seven years war and convinced of the valor of Columbia's sons, relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quished her swelling hopes of conquest, and acknowledged the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence of the United States. The independence of America in all its consequences, is one of the most important revolutions in the history of man. The bosterous and precipitate revolutions of Greece and Rome, vanish into nothing, when compared to the revolution of America. They took place when men were igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the true principles of political science, when the lessons of poets and philosophers served rather to confound and distract, than illuminate the understanding. The power of legislation was vested in the body of the people, and they collected in turbulent factious assemblies, better adapted to produce scenes of blood, than wholesome laws.</p>
            <p>The violent impulse given to the passions by harrangueing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magogues broke down every barrier of decency and the public good was swallowed up in the turbulence of parties. But a genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine representative republic, is an experiment in political science reserved for the new world. When we contemplate the sublime aspect of republicanism in opposition to monarchy, how majestic does it appear—built on the general good, uniting in one august assembly, the wisdom, the virtue, integrity and responsibility of a nation, extending its fatherly protection to the lowest member of the community—Monarchy, thou pest and enemy of the human race, drop your glittering crown and submit to its empire!</p>
            <p>A legislative assembly deliberating for the good of a great na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, studious in the investigation of truth, and which looks with a single eye to the good of the whole, is one of the most noble and animating spectacles in nature. While the cabinets of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, plotting the extermination of the human race, engender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing schemes replete with mischief and of death, and whose only
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028815_0011_0FDD501EF1690C40"/>
object is to add splendor and pageantry to royalty, strikes every moral sentiment of the heart with disgust—humanity shudders, honesty and justice affrighted and astonished, turn from the petri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying sight and sensibility on the rack, vents herself in tears and in groans. O, monarchy! what hast thou to answer for? Not content with excluding from thy courts the wise, the poor, and the virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but thou must wring from poverty its last morsel, and sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice thousands of innocent men to satiate thy inordinate, thy intern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ambition: but thanks to the auspices of republicanism, thy gau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy trappings are fast losing their fascinating influence.</p>
            <p>In a free government, commerce expands her sails; prompted by a spirit of enterprize and a desire of gain, men venture the dangers of a bosterous ocean, in pursuit of new commodities. An acquaintance with man hence results. He participates of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures and miseries of his species; he feels for all that suffer, he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists their wants, his heart melts into affection, and the rough im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable particles of the monk and barbarian, dissolve into the sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathising heart of a citizen of civilized life. Commercial inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course too has its evils. By our extensive trade we import false ideas of honor, we import prejudices more pernicious to the sanity of the body politic, than infection to the body natural. The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious influence of commercial intercourse with despotic kingdoms, has long been observed, both by the philosopher and politician. It was on this principle that Lycurgus substituted iron instead of the precious metals, as a circulating medium and interdicted foreign commerce. It is a subject of weighty consideration for every A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican legislature to determine upon the propriety of changing our trade into channels where dangers of this kind would be less to be apprehended; but we fondly hope, that the new order of things taking place in Europe, will anticipate this necessity.</p>
            <p>Among the advantages of a free government its influence on the progress of science, stands very conspicuous. The enlightened sun of reason already begin to shed its benign influence in every branch of science. The heart and mind begin to expand—subjects heretofore impenetrable and interdicted by authority, are now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veloped with remarkable boldness and success. Genius has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded its wings and soars aloft under the genial sun of liberty, in quest of scientific treasures. The literary productions of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent day wear a boldness of aspect; a depth of investigation, and precision of argument unrivalled in any former age. May we not indulge a hope that the reign of liberty will usher in the discovery and the reign of truth? Who can calculate the possible and prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able consequences of the revolutionary principles of the present
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028815_0012_0FDD50206C98D308"/>
age. Unfettered, unrestrained, may we not by progressive im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, penetrate into the mysteries of animate and inanimate matter? May we not discover the secret spring of life and anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Another portion of our history yet remains; the articles of our union formed in the hurry and bustle of war when invasion and danger prompted the several state governments to supply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of power in the general government, we experienced few difficulties; but when peace took place, the counteracting regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of the several States, created very urgent embarrassments. England, eager to throw every obstacle in the way of our prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, refused to enter into amicable and reciprocal regulations. Under this pressing exigency, we were under the imperious neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of delegating more power to the general government. To pass over the merits and defects of the new constitution, new and unexpected changes have taken place in Europe. Our allies the French, have compassed a revolution unparalelled in history. The change of commercial regulations which was expected to follow the new constitution, and which was urged as a strong reason for its adoption, has not equalled the promises of its votaries. Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions have arisen that the conduct of our administration, discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed pu<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>imity to England, and a secret hostility to the success of the French Republic. Whatever of truth these suspicions may contain, it is my opinion that the feelings of the government have not been in unison with those of the people. On this account has it been thought proper that the people should come forward in soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eties and express their opinion of public measures. The decay of liberty in every country in which it has ever got any footing; the powerful propensities of the human heart to corruption, and the difficulty of concentring, the public will, warrant us in using eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry precaution against the assumption of power, or the omission of duty; and it is always a strong mark of suspicion, when govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment draws a veil over its transactions, that power delegated, has not been exercised for the good of the people. For the laudable purpose of re-kindling the expiring flame of liberty have we asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated, &amp; not for the dark secret purposes of sedition and disorgani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation, which our enemies have surmised. I am sure we have, and ever will evince ourselves friends to law, peace and order. The tree of liberty has taken some root in America; water it; cherish its growth; let not its foliage wither, nor the rude blast of tyranny and faction shake its aspiring trunk—while its roots are yet tender, beware of the devouring worm, beware of the insidious efforts of foreign and domestic foes. We are far from a state of moral and political perfection; born and bred under a motly mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028815_0013_0FDD5024ECF17670"/>
of democracy, aristocracy, and despotism, its impressions and its dictates are hard to be obliterated—But the corroding ulcerated heart of monarchy, must be probed to the bottom before a perm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anent foundation can be laid for republican establishments.</p>
            <p>I might remind you of a prevalent idea, that representation is a representation of property and not of the people:—an idea the legitimate offspring of feudal despotism. I might remind you of the homage paid to the wealthy, while the poor and the virtuous are treated with neglect and with scorn. I might remind you of numerous outrages upon natural and immutable justice in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision of courts. I might recount numerous instances of the des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potism of our hearts. The great work of reformation is but just begun. When peace established our independence, and the mind was left free to inquiry and investigation, I certainly expected a reformation of civil and criminal justice: but the material features of the English code are still prominent. A few notorious abuses of natural justice are amended. The severity of the criminal code is a reproach to freedom and to justice. Shall we turn from Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, the first favorite seat of liberty, to France for an example? Shall we be outstripped in the universal career of improvement? Shall we be distanced in the Olympian games of virtue? Forbid it shame! forbid it justice! It is better to instruct than correct; it is better to correct than destroy; and government is never more in the sphere of duty, than in opening every avenue to knowledge. The atrocious crimes that have heretofore stained the character of man, have been more owing to ignorance and the powerful temptations strewed in his path by government, than any inherent depravity.</p>
            <p>How many crimes has government created? And what a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful interest does she feel in the discovery of crimes, and in the conviction of offenders, when her coffers are filled by the decisions of her courts—When the deprivation of life will not satiate her vengeance, what shall we expect from her clemency or justice?</p>
            <p>A family deprived of its head, deprived of its property, and a reproach in society, is a sight so truly affecting, that the ferocious, vindictive heart of government itself might relent. The vindic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive spirit of the laws, the implacable, intolerant disposition of the heart, obscure the brilliancy of our revolution. The intolerance of sectaries, the intolerance of faction and party spirit, darken and discolor the rays of political light that have penetrated our horizon.</p>
            <p>The heart of man has been too deep in the mire of corruption to purify itself instantly. The violent ferment in America has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled a small portion of it upon the surface. Be vigilant, be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028815_0014_0FDD5026725D7E60"/>
that the minions of despotism do not regain an empire in our hearts, and in the resolutions of our councils.</p>
            <p>The violent tide of the passions in favor of despotism, requires the most vigilant caution. They have always been the voluntary tools of despotism; and reason, the watchman upon the tower of republicanism, should be perpetually awake to their insidious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches. We are in a comparatively happy land. We are in the lap of plenty. The choicest blessings of providence are shed upon us.</p>
            <p>Our sensibility is not wounded with the extreme poverty of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean despotism, nor our indignation aroused at the unmerited profusion shed upon her vicious, ignorant, and abandoned nobility. With temperance, industry and care, health, plenty, and liberty may be the universal lot of Columbia's sons. Our fields are clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with grass, our harvests wave in token of plenty, our trees bow with their loads, and the air itself breathes sweetness. But while we are basking under the warm sun-shine of freedom, a greater part of man are groaning under an insupportable tyranny. Some are pining under the galling chain, some wasting the vigor of their days in gloomy and hopeless confinement, without one ray of consolation, while others are wading through seas of blood to attain liberty and independence. We may sit on the clift of neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality without the sphere of the boisterous tempest, and quietly observe the sublime, the awful, and tremendous prospect of the conflict of armies and of battles, and of the wreck and fall of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, while the political atmosphere of Europe is dissolving with fervent heat, consuming and sweeping away the vile fabrics of despotism, we are sitting under our vines and fig-trees enjoying the sweet fruits of our former exertions.</p>
            <p>Permit me to call your attention to the particular observance of this day; a day noted in the annals of fame. The celebration of festivals is a custom of great antiquity. It is coeval with the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and the first existence of man. The FOURTH OF JULY de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the most cordial celebration. It contains within its acts the most ineffable of blessings. A day dear to every freeman, and which the brazen trumpet of fame is now sounding through the four quarters of the globe. A day that has taught kings their weakness and the people their strength. A day that has inspired into man his primitive sense of freedom and the rank he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed to hold in the varied scale of creation. When all creation mourned, when genius was smothered in embryo, when every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of intellect was palsied in its origin, when darkness perva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded our horizon, and the iron sceptre of despotism had fastened
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028815_0015_0FDD50282D590628"/>
man under its imperious reign, the Fourth of July broke the bands asunder, and opened a new and animating prospect to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbia's sons. All hall, auspicious day! thou hast unlosened the gordian knot of despotism;—thou hast set the captive free—thou hast given birth to a new empire in the west—thou hast paved the way to the emancipation of the human race. Shall we not chaunt the blessings of freedom? Shall we hang our harps upon the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, forgetful of the day that gave us birth?</p>
            <p>Were we uninterruptedly to pursue our several occupations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of our political welfare, how long would the Goddess of liberty illuminate our prospects, and animate our hearts. The coldness, the unanimating employments of common life, would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numb our feelings, disunite our hearts and exertions, and again we would become the fit tools of despotism.</p>
            <p>We must occasionally visit the altar of liberty if we retain the spirit of freedom. The celebration of festivals vivifies the torpid faculties of the soul, awakens intellect, enlarges our views, and animates to virtuous and heroic deeds. What a magnificent spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle would all the sons of Columbia make, met in one august as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly, celebrating the day of their political birth. And what an indignant sight would it be, to behold the slaves of despotism cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round their tyrant and oppressor. Can it be that human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is so degraded? Can it be that their joy on such occasions, flows from a pure, voluntary, and untainted fountain? The 4th of July, has put a final termination to the progress of despotism. Despotism like a roaring lion has pursued man in all his steps. Did he fly into the wilderness, despotism would pursue and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. Despotism has travelled with unvaried and measured steps from the rising almost to the setting sun.</p>
            <p>Asia the first seat of man, and once the garden spot of the world, has been swept with the bosom of despotism and destruction. It has stained the plains of Asia with crimson gore, converted its fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile fields into barren heaths, degenerated the minds of its inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants below the level of their species, and man intended for the ornament and crown of the creation, has become an object of pity, contempt and indignation. Despotism has uniformly kept pace with the population of the world—neither sea, ocean, rivers, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, nor continents, could interrupt its invincible progress. In Africa how is humanity outraged by the infamous traffic and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of the human species. In Asia how is intellect crucified, and every benevolent emotion stifled in embryo. The imbecility of mind and servile disposition of its inhabitants are a living mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento of the pernicious reign of despotism to every votary of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:028815_0016_0FDD502970A28FC0"/>
In what a degrading aspect does Europe place a great part of its inhabitants by the creation of her privileged orders, by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of its laws and edicts, and the pusillanimous, political and religious superstition that universally reigns in her domain.</p>
            <p>But fortunately for man, when despotism had extended its em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire over three quarters of the globe, and with gigantic strides traversed the atlantic to invade the new world, the political rays of light that beamed upon the minds of Columbia's sons, animated them to repel the invading monster. Appalled at the sight of light, the monster vanished, the proud waves of despotism were stayed, and the empire of reason, liberty and truth gained an honorable and memorable victory. The 4th of July opened a new fountain of authority, and turned its current from west to east. The rays that enlightened the hemisphere of America have rebounded to Europe, and now enlighten and animate the cold, lifeless, dark regions of despotism. The mind entombed in ignorance felt its invigorating and resuscitating influence. The thick fog of despotism dissipates before the penetrating rays of reason, the horizon of liberty begins to enlarge and expand, and we have a real hope that despotism will retire to its original kingdom of choas and darkness. The long expected and predicted age of peace and felicity, the hope of the virtuous and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the wicked has already begun. And I look forward, fellow-citizens, with anxious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> solicitude to a time when benevolence shall gush in limpid streams from the heart consoling all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted, and when wisdom shall dart with electrical velocity from mind, enlightening and invigorating the whole family of man. I anticipate an age when the temple of Janus shall be forever shut, when men shall no longer array themselves in hostility, when the sword shall be beat into plough-shares and pruning-hooks, when the tree of liberty shall extend its branches over the habitable globe, and when liberty wafted on the wings of time shall pervade all hearts and all climes, and the large family of man join in one general chorus in commemoration of the 4th of July.</p>
