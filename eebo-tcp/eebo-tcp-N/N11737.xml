            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <q>
                  <hi>I will bleſs the</hi> LORD <hi>at all times: His praiſe ſhall continually be in my mouth.</hi>

            <p>THE preſent ſtate is a mixed ſtate. This is ſo as to individuals, and alſo to communities. In the courſe of God's providence, proſperity and adverſity ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed eath other; and there is oftentimes a quick tranſition from one to the other. It is in this caſe as it is in the courſe of nature: When all is bright, ſerene and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, a ſtorm ſuddenly ariſes, and rages with great impetuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and violence, and in ſome ſituations great is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs and miſery occaſioned thereby. After which all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes calm and bright again. Neither individuals nor communities "in their proſperity may ſay, they ſhall never be moved." When they imagine their "mountain ſtands ſtrong," it is eaſy with God to ſhake it even to its centre; to throw them down from the pinnacle of eaſe, grandeur, wealth and affluence—and it is eaſy for him
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014830_0004_0F9789FB9A209D28"/>
again to exalt them.—To be raiſed from a low, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſtate, is agreeable to nature. Mankind naturally deſire proſperity, and deprecate adverſity. Adverſity, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in remarkable inſtances of it, ſpreads a gloom over them, and they are ready to deſpond and give up all for loſt. They view the dark ſide of things, and dwell upon them in their mournful contemplations, not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that the great Governor of the world can cauſe light to ſpring up out of darkneſs, reverſe the ſcene, and bring good out of evil. They are apt to forget paſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and to overlook thoſe which God intermixes with their adverſities, and ſo are unapt and indiſpoſed to make their proper acknowledgments to him.</p>
            <p>THERE are two grand and important duties, which, both reaſon and the word of God call men to, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him as the great orderer and diſpoſer of all events both good and evil—<hi>Prayer,</hi> for the beſtowment of needed good—and <hi>praiſe</hi> for the receipt of it. Conſidering ourſelves as needy creatures, the duty of prayer is of continual obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. And conſidering ourſelves as the daily ſubjects of the mercies of God, the duty of praiſe is alſo of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual obligation. It was from an impreſive ſenſe of this, that the pious Pſalmiſt utters himſelf, as in the words of our text. "I will bleſs the Lord at all times, his praiſe ſhall be <hi>continually</hi> in my mouth."<note n="*" place="bottom">

THE words plainly import this—That God's crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, at all times, and under all circumſtances and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of life, have occaſion to praiſe and bleſs him.</p>
            <p>NONE ſurely will call it in queſtion, that they have ſuch occaſion in times of proſperity; when the aſpects of divine providence are agreeable and pleaſant. Men muſt be loſt to all ſenſe of God, and of their obligations to him, not to acknowledge that praiſe is a juſt tribute due to him on account of his favours and benefits. There are few indeed that will carry matters to ſuch a length as this, ſpeculatively, whatever they may do practically. That they do ſo practically, is the caſe in a multitude of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. Though they are the ſubjects of many and great favours at the hands of God, yet they have no grateful ſenſe of them, and are groſsly negligent in making their acknowledgements to him. Their own reaſon, if they only appeal to that, muſt utterly condemn them for ſuch unworthy treatment of their Maker and bounteous Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor.</p>
            <p>It may be made evident, that in times of evil and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, men have <hi>even</hi> then occaſion to praiſe God. Surely then they have ſo, when it is clear, bright ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine with them. "I will bleſs the Lord at all times, ſays David, his praiſe ſhall be continually in my mouth."</p>
            <p>EVILS and calamities, it is true, in themſelves, whether perſonal or publick, "are not joyous, but grievous." Thus it is as to bodily ſickneſs and pain. Thus alſo is
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014830_0006_0F9789FD34E35E20"/>
it, when droughts and peſtilences are ſent into a land, and when their peace and tranquility is interrupted by the ſword of war.—Such calamities as theſe, undoubtedly call for deep humiliation before God, as hereby he teſtifies his anger and diſpleaſure againſt a land for the many and heinous iniquities that abound in it. Theſe moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, are the procuring cauſe of them. If piety and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue univerſally prevailed, no evils or judgments would be ſent upon a land. The moral ſtate of a people, we may well ſuppoſe, influences the moral Governor of the world in his conduct towards them, either in a way of favour or calamity.</p>
            <p>BUT although judgments, ſuch as we juſt mentioned, are to be conſidered as tokens of God's anger againſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing iniquities, and in this view call for deep humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before a holy and offended Sovereign, yet conſiſtent with this, occaſion is then offered for praiſe.—For "God, who does not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men," who delights not in their diſtreſſes and miſeries, has merciful deſigns towards them in his judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial diſpenſations. He deſigns to humble them and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify them; to bring them to true repentance, to reform all their vices and immoralities, to reduce them to the love and practice of univerſal piety, godlineſs and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſueſs, and in this way to prepare them for his ſmiles and bleſſings in all regards. For "righteouſneſs" has a moral as well as natural tendency to "exalt a nation" or people. If now, ſuch are the merciful deſigns of the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014830_0007_0F978A001FD788F8"/>
great Governor of the world, when he ſends evils and calamities upon a land, then occaſion is hereby miniſtred for praiſe to his great name.</p>
            <p>THE deſign of Heaven in calamitous diſpenſations, may be to bring people to that, which his kind and merciful ones have been ineffectual to. For although the merciful diſpenſations of GOD, eſpecially a long ſeries of them, and in great and moſt important reſpects, ought in all reaſon to engage men's unfeigned gratitude, and put them upon manifeſting it in a life of true godlineſs and virtue, yet frequently they have not ſuch a deſireable effect as this.—Their caſe is often, much as it is ſaid of <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

               </gap> fat and kick." While they talk of a long ſeaſon in the ſun-ſhine of the divine favours, they are unmindful of their great benefactor, riot in his bounties and make them the fewel of their luſts. Thus evilly do they requite the Lord who has done ſo many good things for them.—The holy GOD who is hereby greatly diſhonored, ſees fit to alter the ſcene, to take his rod in his hand and to chaſtiſe them, and ſometimes very ſorely; that hereby they may be reduced to ſuch an obediential conduct as his manifold mercies were ineffectual to bring them to. And ſo by his altering his hand, he deſigns upon the whole, their benefit and advantage. For if they are brought to that humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, godlineſs and virtue, which GOD expects of them, great is the advantage and benefit reſulting to them from his judicial diſpenſations, however ſore and diſtreſſing.—They are then prepared for the removal of them, and for the return of GOD'S favours and bleſſings in all deſirable inſtances of them, ſo that on the whole here, there is occaſion to praiſe GOD in times of evil and calamity; not for evils and calamities in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014830_0008_0F978A0118C82D60"/>
conſidered, but for the good ends GOD has in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them on.</p>
            <p>BUT then it may be further obſerved—That ſometimes, yea, for the moſt part, there are many poſitive mercies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in times of evil.</p>
            <p>INDIVIDUALS for the moſt part find it ſo. It is not often that their ſtate, though greatly afflicted, is yet quite forlorn and deſperate. If they are in pain and ſickneſs of body, yet they may have comfortable houſes, lodging, medicines, food and fewel, and the tender care and help of near and affectionate friends, all which ſerve in ſome meaſure to ſweeten bitter cups, to lighten heavy burdens, and to keep them from ſinking under the preſſure of their troubles.—So alſo, perſons ſometimes meet with ſorrowful bereavements. Thoſe that were near and dear to them are taken away, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom they were wont to place their hopes, and from whom they expected to have much comfort. But then others are ſpared to them, and ſometimes when they have been in the like dangerous circumſtances as thoſe that have been taken away, ſickneſs has been removed from their families, and the voice of health and ſalvation again heard in them.</p>
            <p>IN theſe and other inſtances that might be mentioned, there is mercy intermixed with afflictions. And at the ſame time that they are called to humiliation and mourning, they have yet abundant occaſion for thankfulneſs and praiſe to GOD. In ſhort, there is no condition that perſons may be in, but upon a view of all circumſtances, they may find mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for praiſe to GOD. And conſidering their deſerts at his hands, their utter unworthineſs before him, by reaſon of their vileneſs, ingratitude, diſobedience and rebellion towards his ſacred majeſty, they may with the ſtricteſt juſtice take up that

            </p>
            <p>THE ſame obſervation with reſpect to individuals, holds true with reſpect to communities. Sometimes after a long Sun-ſhine, GOD "creates darkneſs." After a long calm, he raiſes a ſtorm, and cauſes it to beat fiercely upon them. The ſtate of their affairs wear a different aſpect from what they did not long before. A very gloomy proſpect opens before them, and it may ſeem as if utter ruin and deſtruction awaited them.</p>
            <p>THOSE terrible calamities of war, peſtilence and drought come in the room of peace, health and plenty. Theſe bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they may have long been in the enjoyment of, but did not ſufficiently prize them; but in having the ſcene ſo; changed and altered, they are brought to know the worth of what they once enjoyed.—But now, upon a view of all circumſtances, much of the goodneſs of GOD is to be ſeen amidſt all theſe evils, and they have occaſion for praiſe as well as humiliation.</p>
            <p>THIS that I have now ſaid, holds true with reſpect to us in this land.</p>
            <p>For a long courſe of years, there has been a very general and remarkable ſtate of health throughout the land. No contagious mortal ſickneſs has GOD ſent into it, as was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the caſe. I need not mention inſtances here.—And by this means we have greatly increaſed and multiplied, been enabled to extend our ſettlements, and many of them, though young, have greatly flouriſhed and proſpered, and have bid fair to do ſo more and more under the common

But in the ſummer paſt GOD was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſend a moſt grievous peſtilence into the land, and great has been the mortality in one place and in another, and in ſome not far from us.<note n="*" place="bottom">The diſeaſe above alluded to was the Dyſentry, or as it is commonly called, the Camp Diſtemper. A great mortality hereby, there was in the towns of SUTTON, MARLBOROUGH, GROTON, DEDHAM, as well as in divers other towns in this, as well as in the neighbouring governments.</note> In this matter, GOD has dealt as favorably with us in this place, perhaps as with any in the land.<note n="†" place="bottom">But one ſingle perſon in this large, populous town, died of the above diſeaſe, many families were viſited, though not ſeverely. The family to which this perſon belonged was the moſt ſo. A large family, almoſt all viſited, but all recovered except this one.</note> What ſpecial cauſe for praiſe and thankfulneſs have we for his great goodneſs in ſuch a time of calamity and diſtreſs? Is it, brethren! for our diſtinguiſhing goodneſs, righteouſneſs and virtue, that we have been thus favorably dealt with! This is a matter worthy our conſideration. And if upon a ſerious and impartial conſideration, it ſhall appear that we have been as obnoxious as others who have been viſited, the ſparing mercy and goodneſs of GOD de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands our unfeigned gratitude.—But then, with reſpect to the land in general, the fatal malady is greatly abated if not wholly ſubſided. And the voice of health is again heard in our land. And this alſo, as members of the body demands our gratitude and praiſe to the great preſerver of men.</p>
            <p>IT may be added—that peace is a bleſſing which for many years paſt has been enjoyed in our land. No wars nor ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of wars, no military campaigns and battels—"No confuſed noiſe of warriors nor garments rolled in blood."
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014830_0011_0F978A030FF3D4F0"/>
No people on the earth have in this reſpect been happier, or it may be, ſo happy as we have been. Public peace and tranquility is a great and ineſtimable bleſſing. Men feel and enjoy themſelves in ſuch a ſtate, agreable to the rank they hold in the creation. Hereby ſcope is given to popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and increaſe—to the flouriſhing of the liberal and mechanic arts—to the increaſing in their trade, commerce, navigation, &amp;c. and under the ſmiles of divine providence to their becoming great and opulent, and reſpectable both at home and abroad. When they dwell in peace, unmoleſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by enemies, they then bid fair to be in the agreable ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that Moſes in GOD'S name encourages the people of Iſrael with upon their obedience. "Thou ſhall lend unto many nations, and thou ſhall not borrow. And the Lord ſhall make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou ſhall be above only, and thou ſhall not be beneath."<note n="*" place="bottom">DEUT. xxviii. 12, 13.</note> Plenty, wealth, dignity, liberty, all ſeem to be compriſed here.</p>
            <p>When ſuch is the ſtate of a land, we may very properly adopt the language of David; having recounted ſome ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal inſtances of GOD'S kindneſs, which he might apply to his own people, or however leave for general application. "Happy is that people that is in ſuch a caſe."<note n="*" place="bottom">PSALM cxliv. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>5.</note> Among the inſtances of happineſs that he mentions, is that of being free from the moleſtations of enemies, and ſo of courſe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying internal peace and tranquility, beſides enjoying di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other kinds of happineſs in connection with this, as noticed in the preceeding verſes. And I cannot but add with the Pſalmiſt, "yea," or rather, "happy is that people whoſe God is the Lord," whoſe he is in a ſpecial peculiar
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014830_0012_0F978A03D1E43B10"/>
ſenſe, a GOD in covenant, through JESUS CHRIST, the bleſſed mediator. And now, notwithſtanding, as it has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that vice, luxury, and all kinds of immoralities are wont to increaſe in proportion, as countries grow great and opulent, yet this cannot be the natural, unavoidable ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of things; but muſt be owing to a ſtrange infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in mankind, to a moſt wretched perverſion of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of a good providence. The deſign of GOD in all the inſtances of his goodneſs; public proſperity and happineſs among the reſt, is to engage men to univerſal gratitude and obedience towards him. And being in ſuch a happy, proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous ſtate, as we have mentioned, as they are under great obligations; ſo, they are under great advantages for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in religion: To attend upon the public duties and offices thereof, which are wiſely deſigned and well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted, and with a concurring divine bleſſing, have often been ſucceeded to the effecting the purpoſes of real, vital piety and Godlineſs; which ſhould it generally prevail in a land, would be its greateſt glory, dignity, excellency, ſafety and defence. If it was ſaid of the renowned <hi>Elijah</hi> upon his tranſlation, that he was "the chariot of Iſrael and the horſemen thereof." What ſhall be ſaid of a land, what of its greatneſs, dignity and ſafety, when there are great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his excellent ſpirit and character? "Righteouſneſs exalteth a nation" more than any thing elſe, for it is the moſt excellent thing, above gold, yea above fine gold. It is this that renders it peculiarly, yea moſt eminently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable. One obſerves upon the caſe of <hi>Elijah,</hi> "that he was to that people, by his counſels, reproofs and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, better than the ſtrongeſt force of chariots and horſes, and kept off the judgments of GOD. His departure was like the routing of an army, an irreparable loſs. Better have
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014830_0013_0F978A055F15AC10"/>
loſt all their men of war, than this man of GOD," How great now muſt be the glory and ſafety of a people, when there are many, many <hi>Elijahs</hi> among them? And I would obſerve, that the outward peace, proſperity and the flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a people, affords ſpecial opportunities and advantages for the forming men in general to the excellent character we have mentioned.</p>
            <p>So that peace and tranquility in a land muſt be conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as an ineſtimable bleſſing to it. Happy would it be was it to prevail amongſt all mankind of every tongue, tribe and nation. But this cannot be expected ſo long as the luſts of men, their pride, avarice, revenge, &amp;c. remain. Happy would it be were theſe deſtroyed, and the kingdom of the prince of peace univerſally eſtabliſhed in the earth.</p>
            <p>WE may now go on to obſerve, that war is a very great and diſtreſſing calamity, and it is proportionally ſo, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the ſeat of it is near or far off. It is when it is ſent into a land, greatly impoveriſhing to it, drains it of its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and occaſions many ſorrowful breaches in towns and families. Things are put out of courſe, men's trade and commerce and various occupations greatly obſtructed, their ſubſiſtance, deriving from their induſtry and diligence, greatly failing, and ſometimes quite cut off, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come reduced to great ſtraits and difficulties. Thus it is in a great many inſtances. We have ſufficient proof of this at the preſent day.—At beſt a variety of difficulties and hardſhips muſt neceſſarily be undergone by a people, at a time when the ſword of war is drawn upon them, and they are expoſed to the devaſtations of it. This is a calamity that has been very common in the earth from age to age.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014830_0014_0F978A0613BD2960"/>
"Nation has lift up ſword againſt nation." And what depopulation of countries, what ſlaughters and deſolations have been made in the earth? We may ſee the full proof of all this, if we only look into the antient ſcripture-hiſtory. There has been the like proof of it in latter times, in our own, as well as in the times of our fathers.</p>
            <p>As to internal peace and tranquility in our land, as I ſaid before, no people on earth have been happier than we have, of a long ſeaſon. Notwithſtanding frequent incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in former years of the ſavages of the wilderneſs upon our expoſed frontiers, yet no invaſion of foreign powers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our ſea-coaſts. Whatever, attempts there have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times been of this ſort, yet through the good hand of our GOD towards us, they have proved abortive. We have been called to "ſtand ſtill and ſee the ſalvation of GOD.<note n="*" place="bottom">This was remarkably the caſe in the year 1746, in the defeat of the powerful French Squadron, under the command of the Duke D'Anville. Moſt fearful devaſtation would undoubtedly have been the conſequence, had he ſucceeded, eſpecially upon our ſea-coaſts. But GOD "perſecuted them with his tempeſt, and made them afraid with his ſtorm." "He ſent out his arrows and ſcattered them, and ſhot out lightnings and diſcomfited them. This defeat through the good hand and providence of GOD, is very curiouſly ſet forth in a Thankſgiving Sermon preached at Boſton, upon that memor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able occaſion, by the late Reverend and learned Mr. Prince.</note>"</p>
            <p>BUT the time is come, when the ſword of war is drawn upon us; not by foreign powers, but by our fellow-ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> with whom, we long maintained a friendly, brotherly correſpondence, equally to their advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage as ours. And this would doubtleſs have continued
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014830_0015_0F978A06DDD684F0"/>
without interruption, but for the evil councils, the dark po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies and baſe intrigues of ſome in power and high dignity at home, aided and aſſiſted, as is but too evident by ſome among ourſelves. I would be far from treſpaſſing upon the rules of charity, but there is notwithſtanding clear light and evidence.</p>
            <p>AND matters are now come to be very ſerious indeed.—The conteſt it ſeems, is not to be decided but at the point of the ſword. This for ſeveral months has been drawn up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, and we have been pierced and wounded and greatly diſtreſſed by it. Our capital town has been taken poſſeſſion of by Britiſh troops—from its being the grand reſort of the country, the ſeat of plenty, affluence and adminiſtration of civil juſtice—remarkable for its obſervation of the public duties and offices of religion, and particularly on the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian-ſabbath, as I am thoroughly knowing to.—This, which has alſo been the city of our ſolemnities, whither our tribes both of the civil and ſacred order annually aſſembled to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and promote the good both of church and ſtate. This ſtately, elegant city is converted into a garriſon. One of its ſacred temples turned into a nurſury for dragooning.<note n="*" place="bottom">The old South Meeting-Houſe.</note> Though we do not ſuperſtitiouſly with the papiſts, maintain the doctrine of the <hi>real</hi> holineſs of places ſet apart for the worſhip of GOD, yet methinks ſuch a treatment of a place of publick worſhip, indicates a moſt ſhameful, horrible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, and a public mockery of the eſtabliſhed religion of the country<note n="†" place="bottom">It may with propriety be ſo ſpoken of, if it be ONLY conſidered that the laws reſpecting it, have received the royal ſanction.</note>. When I conſider what a grave and reſpectable aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly were wont to worſhip in that houſe, now ſo ſhamefully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated and polluted; when I reflect upon the memories of the venerable WILLARD, PEMBERTON, SEWALL, PRINCE, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014830_0016_0F978A078EA2B828"/>
divers excellent young miniſters<note n="*" place="bottom">Two of which, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the Rev. ALEXANDER CUMMING, and the Rev. JOHN HUNT, have deceaſed in the midſt of their days and uſefulneſs.—Two others, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the Rev. SAMUEL BLAIR, and the Rev. JOHN BACON, of reſpectable characters, received a diſmiſsion at their own requeſt.</note> ſince them, who have burnt and ſhone in that golden candleſtick; of the pure, ſpiritual worſhip all along therein maintained. I cannot but feel an inward grief, as well as juſt indignation, at ſuch a horrible ſacrilegious treatment of it—not by Roman-Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks, but by thoſe that profeſs the Proteſtant, reformed religion.</p>
            <p>IT may be further ſaid with regard to that devoted City, that its harbour is crowded with powerful ſhips of war.—Its trade, navigation and fiſhery wholly cut off. Military law eſtabliſhed in it. Its Churches broken up. Its inhabitants even the moſt rich and opulent among them moſtly gone off, leaving all their rich and valuable effects behind them, with but very little proſpect of ever recovering them. Its poor that were publicly ſupported, turned adrift into the wide world. And many that were comfortable to live, through their honeſt induſtry in their ſeveral occupations, now obliged to the public charity. And thoſe that remain, for the moſt part, reduced to the greateſt ſtrait and wants, cut off from all thoſe ſupplies that were wont to flow in to them, and out of the reach of their friends and brethren in the country, who have very ſenſibly felt for them, and would gladly have miniſtered to their neceſſities, had it been at all practicable. But all communication being wholly ſtopt, they are in danger of periſhing the enſuing winter, by hunger and cold.</p>
            <p>THIS is a true picture of that once diſtinguiſhedly happy town. Nor am I ſenſible of having at all heightned the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:014830_0017_0F978A0850F76A10"/>
of it. Much of our blood has been ſpilt in battles and ſkirmiſhes. There have been divers captures of our veſſels, with their valuable cargoes. And two of our large, flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing and wealthy towns,<note n="*" place="bottom">CHARLESTOWN and FALMOUTH, in Caſco-Bay. The inhabitants of the former, had for ſometime before deſerted it, and removed their moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable effects; and ſo were in no capacity at all of annoying the regular troops. Had they been in any danger from this quarter, eſpecially after they become maſters of Bunker-hill, they might have had ſome plauſible pretence to lay it waſte.—As to the latter, it is at a great diſtance from the ſeat of action, and being without any fortification was not capable of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any defence. Nor was that place ſpecially obnoxious. Some may call this true heoriſm and generalſhip; but all ſober, impartial perſons, muſt look upon the deſtruction of both, as the effect of wantonneſs, not to ſay, cruelty and barbarity.</note> wantonly laid in aſhes. And a ſettled plan to reduce all our ſea-ports, they can have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to, to the ſame condition. And if poſſible to penetrate into the interior parts of the country, and to ſpread deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ruin far and wide, without any diſtinction of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and then to bring the miſerable, enfeebled inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants that remain, into a ſtate of the moſt abject ſervitude.</p>
            <p>BUT I would now go to obſerve—That notwithſtanding ſuch a diſmal ſtate of things has taken place among us, yet we have abundant cauſe for praiſe and thankfulneſs to GOD that he has intermixed ſo many mercies with this calamity, ſo that our caſe is not as yet come quite forlorn and deſperate, whatever it may be in time to come; yea, that we may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain ſome hope, at leaſt, of being ere long delivered from this calamity, and of being again reſtored to peace and tranquility.</p>
            <p>I have mentioned various favourable circumſtances with reſpect to other calamities we have been viſited with, the peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilence
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014830_0018_0F978A090F668910"/>
and drought. And many favourable ones have there been with reſpect to the war, in which we are unhappily involved.</p>
            <p>THUS when they firſt commenced it upon us at Lexing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and Concord, they found our people, contrary to expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, brave and reſolute; and though few in number, in compare with them, yet they were repulſed with great loſs, and diſappointed of performing their enterpriſe. Their having thus waged war upon us,<note n="*" place="bottom">If giving the firſt fire determines the point of commencing war, abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant evidence has been exhibited both from the living and the dead, that they (near a 1000 in number) commenced it upon our little handful at Lexington. However, it has been juſtly obſeved—that "he that arms himſelf, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a robbery, and demands the traveller's purſe, by the terror of inſtant death, is the firſt aggreſſor, though the other ſhould take the advantage of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging his piſtol firſt and killing the robber."—Rev. Preſident Langdon's Sermon before the Provincial Congreſs, May 31, 1775.</note> at once rouſed not only this but all the colonies far and near: And they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately and readily poured in from all quarters to check and reſtrain them from further onſets and violences. In conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which, they were ſoon ſurrounded and hemmed in on every ſide, ſo that they have been in a beſieged ſtate to this very day, and extremely drove, officers, from the higheſt to the loweſt, as well as privates, not only with reſpect to the delicacies, but even the neceſſaries of life. Had they not been thus repulſed and reſtrained in the beginning, in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability great would have been the diſtreſs very ſoon in the country towns. And this very town, it is with good reaſon ſuppoſed, was one object in view in the excurſion they made. But "the ſnare was broken, and we have eſcaped. Bleſſed be the Lord, who gave us not a prey to their teeth."</p>
            <p>THE affair of Charleſtown, though they took from us, ſmall in number in compare with them (notwithſtanding a
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:014830_0019_0F978A0A09C1C998"/>
contrary repreſentation ſent home) though, I ſay, they took from us the ground and the works of a ſingle night, yet it was with amazing loſs on their part, not only of privates, but of an uncommon proportion of officers, and ſome of them of principal rank.</p>
            <p>OUR Lines and impregnable fortreſſes, are now extended all around our capital, which they have got poſſeſſion of, and every preparation made to repel them in caſe of an attack. Had an attack been practicable, no doubt it would have been made before now. For it muſt be very humiliating to <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> who have been ſo univerſally (and I will add, in times paſt, particular in the laſt war, among the nations in Europe, ſo juſtly) celebrated for their gallantry, to be under any reſtraint from raw, undiſciplined <hi>Americans,</hi> of whoſe abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they have been wont to entertain the moſt contemptible idea, and upon whom they have been wont to beſtow the moſt opprobious names.</p>
            <p>IT may be added,—That GOD has raiſed up able and experienced Generals, who have brought our army under a good regulation, and time has been given for their acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and becoming very expert in the military art; nor are they wanting in ſtrength and agility of body, nor in manly courage and fortitude. A remarkable ſtate of health has prevailed in it. Notwithſtanding multitudes being viſited with the <hi>Dyſentry,</hi> yet few comparatively have been the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of mortality, not more perhaps, than if they had all tarried at home. A remarkable union and harmony has ran throughout the whole. An abundant ſupply of the neceſſary ſupports and comforts of life, has all along been flowing in to them. Many of their veſſels, with their rich freights, deſigned for our annoyance, and their ſupport and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:014830_0020_0F978A0A8D7B7638"/>
comfort have fallen into our hands.<note n="*" place="bottom">Not only many veſſels of theirs, laden with the richeſt wines, meat, grain and vegetables, have from time to time fallen into our hands, and which they could but poorly ſpare; but one, fraught with vaſt military ſtores, not eaſily to be collected by us in our own land; a particular account of which has been publiſhed, and moſt perhaps have ſeen.</note> And by our various operations, they have been greatly diſtreſſed. And the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the caſe has obliged us to diſtreſs them in all ways in our power.</p>
            <p>To enfeeble, diſpirit and diſtreſs an enemy, from whom nothing could be expected but deſolation and ruin, without ſubmitting to abjectneſs of condition, muſt be juſtified upon the plaineſt principles of reaſon.</p>
            <p>A remarkable and unexpected union has taken place, throughout all the colonies; and their ſeveral Delegates met in General Congreſs, who have had the direction of our military affairs, have diſcovered a wonderful penetration, ſagacity, wiſdom and ſore-caſt in all matters at this critical juncture, big with the fate of America, and have rendered themſelves worthy of the public reſpect and gratitude.</p>
            <p>I may add here as a favorable event in divine providence; that part of our forces have been led to penetrate the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of Canada; that they have been put into poſſeſſion of ſeveral of their ſtrong and important fortreſſes, and that there is ſo promiſing a proſpect of their becoming maſters of the whole country.<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ticonderoga and Crown-Point, they ſoon became maſters of with but little oppoſition. The Forts of Chamblee and St. John's, after a ſhort ſiege ſurrendered. And preſently, Montreal. They have very lately met with a repulſe at Quebec. Herein they have met with but the fortune of war, but they ſtill hope to carry their point there.</note> An important affair this—as part of the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014830_0021_0F978A0DAC8D3660"/>
plan for ſubduing us, it appears probable from various cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, was to let looſe the <hi>Canadians</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> to act over upon our new ſettlements, and ſo gradually along from one ſtage to another, the ſame bloody tragedy that they were wont formerly to do: So placing us, as it were between two fires, from the one or the other of which rendering our deſtruction unavoidable. But this plan, by our operations in the country of <hi>Canada,</hi> bids fair, according to human pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to be defeated, and eſpecially as the inhabitants thereof very generally manifeſt a friendly diſpoſition towards our people, and are ready to afford them all neceſſary ſupplies.</p>
            <p>So that from the various favorable events in the courſe of GOD'S providence in this day of war and great calamity, we are furniſhed with abundant matter of praiſe and thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to his great name. It appears that though he is chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing and correcting us, yet that he hath not wholly caſt off his people, neither hath forſaken his inheritance. And we may even now adopt the grateful language of the redeemed Captives from BABYLON. "The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad."<note n="*" place="bottom">PSALM cxxvi. 3.</note> Upon a ſurvey of his goodneſs in the many important inſtances of it, "his praiſe ſhould be <hi>continually</hi> in our mouths."</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, though GOD has manifeſted his goodneſs towards us in this day of evil, in the manner that has been ſaid, yet we may not "boaſt as though we had put off the harneſs." This we have but juſt "girded on." We may not expect any thing properly miraculous in the courſe of GOD'S providence towards us, but muſt look to the ſtated courſe of it. In his governing providence, he is wont to make uſe of means and inſtruments, which are adapted to ſuch and ſuch ends. Such and ſuch cauſes are wont to produce their
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:014830_0022_0F978A0F47E80470"/>
correſpondent effects: Though it is true, that he can, if in his wiſdom he ſees fit, ſuſpend the influence of natural cauſes. But we may in no caſe of a certainty, depend upon it, that he will do ſo.</p>
            <p>IT appears, that on the other ſide the water, no concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory meaſures have been adopted, nor like to be ſo. Indeed GOD has the hearts of all men in his hands, even of Kings and the great ones of the earth, and it is eaſy with him to turn their hearts towards us. But what lengths it may pleaſe him the holy and righteous governor of the world, to permit them to go, and how far he may ſee fit further to chaſtiſe and puniſh us through their inſtrumentality, we cannot tell. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering our multiplied and aggravated iniquities againſt him as a people, who have been ſo highly favoured and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by him, lifted up to heaven in regard of privileges, civil and ſacred—Conſidering our baſeneſs and ingratitude, for his abundant goodneſs and loving-kindneſs, may not our fleſh tremble for fear of him, and we be afraid, of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſuch as ſhall be totally ruining and deſtroying, which we muſt acknowledge we have juſtly expoſed ourſelves to? GOD has many ways in which he can deſtroy a people. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed whenever he ſees fit, he can do ſo, by an immediate act of his almighty power. But he is wont to make uſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, and ſometimes that of the ſword. This, as we have before obſerved, he has permitted our brethren in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> to draw upon us. It is vaſtly unhappy, it cannot be too much lamented, that we are thus at odds, with a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and nation, that we have been ſo nearly connected with, who have been above all other nations dear to us, being "bone of our bone, and fleſh of our fleſh."—Her glory has been great and we have greatly rejoiced in it. Her moral ſtate indeed has been very ſad. It is no unjuſt reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon her to ſay this. May not the holy GOD complain
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:014830_0023_0F978A10A5A43EE8"/>
over her, as he did over his antient profeſſing people, "Ah ſinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a ſeed of evil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doers, children that are corrupters"?<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah i. 4.</note> What a prevalence of Deiſm and infidelity, prophaneneſs and immorality, diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, luxury, venality and corruption? This wretched, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt ſtate has long been complained of, with reſpect to that highly diſtinguiſhed nation, which has hereby juſtly expoſed itſelf to exterminating judgments. Did that "righteouſneſs by which a nation, is exalted," generally prevail in it, ſuch a conteſt with the colonies, and the calamities conſequent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, it is probable, would not have taken place. And the unnatural, hoſtile, bloody treatment of them at this day, may be looked upon, not as one of the leaſt of the heinous abominations ſhe ſtands chargeable with in the ſight of Heaven.</p>
            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the agency of GOD in calamitous events, ſuch particularly, as he has brought upon us, and the great and important ends he may have in view, yet the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments employed by him (intelligent, voluntary ones I mean) may be actuated from very bad motives and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and may have it in their view to anſwer very bad ends. And thererefore, they are highly culpable in the ſight of GOD. Thus it was as to Joſeph's brethren in their unnatural treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him, of which we read in the book of Geneſis.—They meant what they did unto him "for evil," and they were thoroughly convinced of this in proceſs of time, and led in the anguiſh and bitterneſs of their hearts to acknowledge it. "GOD meant all for good," as the event abundantly made evident. But this was no excuſe for their baſe conduct towards their own natural brother.</p>
            <p>THE unnatural treatment we have met with from our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> is unjuſtifiable in them and very

culpable, whatever may be ſaid of the ſuperintending provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of GOD, and the great and wiſe ends he propoſes to anſwer upon the whole. May a gracious GOD reform all her national errors and vices, and make her "a holy nation, a peculiar people" to himſelf; and mercifully prepare the way for an happy, laſting and honourable accommodation to take place between them and us.<note n="*" place="bottom">War, it has been obſerved in this diſcourſe is a fore calamity. No one acting upon the principles of chriſtianity, which, like its author, breathes nothing but peace and good will to men; or even upon the principles of common humanity, can "delight in it." Lucrative commiſſions, high dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities and honours will weigh nothing againſt theſe principles duly exerciſed. Thus far we may freely ſay, as to the Americans, that they do not engage in the preſent war of choice and with delight. They regret the ſhedding a drop of Britiſh blood.—They are not diſpoſed to laviſh away their OWN blood and treaſure, merely for the ſake of doing ſo. They are not chargeable with ſuch wretched abſurdity as this. Nothing but the great law of ſelf-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which is paramount to all the laws of civil eſtabliſhments, puts them upon drawing the ſword. They would have rejoiced to have continued in harmony with the parent ſtate and they earneſtly wiſh the reſtoration of that harmony. The very idea of rebellion againſt their ſovereign is abhorrent to them.—When a rebellion actually exiſted in North-Britain, in 1746, level<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led directly againſt the crown and dignity of his late Majeſty George II. of glorious memory, by attempting to introduce the pretender to the throne, his loyal ſubjects in America, were univerſally fired with a juſt indignation at the daring attempt. They ſtood ready to ſacrifice their lives and fortunes in ſupport of their ſovereign. They rejoiced when that unnatural rebellion was ſuppreſſed under the victorious arms of his royal Highneſs WILLIAM, Duke of Cumberland. They kept days of public Thankſgiving to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the great goodneſs of GOD in interpoſing in that affair. And they ever remained his dutiful and loyal Subjects afterwards. At his deceaſe, they teſtified their lamentations in every public way,—and then heartily transferred their fealty and allegiance to their new Sovereign, his royal Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor George the Third. All joined to hail his acceſſion to the throne of his royal anceſtors, and to ſay "Let the King live for ever." And as they have never been diſpoſed to ſtrike at his crown and dignity, but agreable to the inſpired direction, to "<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>" him, ſo they cannot but be deeply affected that they lie under his frowns. They deſire nothing more, than to enjoy fully and unimpairedly the benefits of that excellent civil conſtitution, at which he is placed at the head by the providence of the great ſovereign of the world, and that in order to its full ſupport and eſtabliſhment, and that they enjoy inviolate, thoſe charter-rights and privileges, which were <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

They do not deſire to be unconnected with or independent on her, but only to enjoy, what they think they have an unalienable right to; their conſtitutional and charter rights and privileges. In this view of the caſe they deſire to leave their cauſe with that GOD, who judgeth righteouſly They therefore cannot with any juſtice to themſelves, yield to the charge of rebellion, and look upon themſelves as greatly injured in being treated as though they were actually engaged in one.</note> However, I would
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:014830_0025_0F978A12112D9928"/>
obſerve, our caſe is not as yet deſperate. We may hope in GOD, that the event of all will be comfortable and happy to us. Hitherto, many have been the favorable events of GOD'S providence, as we have particularly mentioned them at this time. So that without being over anxious as to futurity, we have great cauſe for thankfulneſs and praiſe to GOD. We have in all times paſt had occaſion to praiſe him, to do ſo "continually" as in our text. And ſuch we have at preſent, notwithſtanding all gloomy circumſtances that have and do attend us.—And we are met together this day in this public manner to celebrate the praiſes of a kind and merciful GOD towards us as a community.—Upon a ſurvey of the goodneſs of GOD in the various inſtances of it, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all our unworthineſs, let us ſee to it, that our hearts are warmed with love and gratitude to Him. And let it not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent us merely to ſpeak his praiſes—let not any merely out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward profeſſions of gratitude ſatisfy us; but in addition here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, let us live the praiſes of the Moſt High; putting away e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very evil and tranſgreſſion, ſo provoking to GOD, and procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

his judgments; devoting ourſelves to his ſervice and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; looking to him, that for the ſake of his ſon Jeſus, all paſt diſobedience may be forgiven, and that he would vouchſafe the vital influences of his bleſſed ſpirit to enable us to a hearty return to him, and to the love and practice of all that duty and ſervice which he requires and expects from us.—This would be to praiſe GOD in the moſt genuine, ſubſtantial manner; and this would be an acceptable ſacrifice to him through Jeſus Chriſt: And if we and this whole people could be brought to this, we might then ſafely leave ourſelves with GOD, commit our cauſe to him, nothing doubting but that he would plead and maintain it. If we are on GOD'S ſide, we may then depend upon it, that he will be on ours, and then more is with us and for us, than can be againſt us. We need not then fear, but that he would be with us, as he was with our fathers, (and he was with them many a time, in their greateſt ſtraits and exigencies, ſuch was their faith and prayer and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagedneſs in his ſervice) and never leave us nor forſake us. And we might then take the comfort of that word with which I cloſe the diſcourſe,—Pſalm 50, laſt verſe, <hi>Whoſe offereth praiſe, glorifieth me, and to him that ordereth his converſation aright will I ſhew the ſalvation of GOD.</hi>
