            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NOtwithstanding the great and unvaluable good that hath
in all ages of the World accrued to Mankind by Order
and Goverment, yet such is the depravedness of mans na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and imperfection of his knowledge, that it is as well
hard to find out, as difficult to maintain, such a Form
and Order of Goverment as will prove a sufficient Fence
and security for so great a treasure as is the common good, and publick
safety. After the sad and long experience of former times, some have
thought no means can be found out so effectual for the upholding and
and preserving the same, with all the sacred and civill rights and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
therunto belonging, as a liberty for people to designe and choose
out from among themselves, the persons that are to be intrusted with
those great concerns. Whatever may be said for the extolling the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness
of them that have such an advantage in their hands, all that may
be comprehended within the compass of such a power, it is for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
in the principal and leading part thereof devolved upon your selves
in all the three Colonies of <hi>New-England;</hi> who by the choyce of the free
people in those your several Jurisdictions, are now called to act your se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parts as chief on the publick stage of Goverment. Ever since you
have taken your turns at the helm, there have been very boisterous
winds and rough Seas, threatning the shipwrack of all; which notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing,
you need not be discouraged, while due consideration is had, to
whom, and what you have embarqued with you. When once the great
<hi>Roman Conquerer,</hi> and chief founder of their Monarchy, was passing the
<hi>Adriatick Sea</hi> in a disguize, the Pilot being dismayed with the fierceness of
the wind, the raging of the waves, his Passenger pulled off his disguize, and
<pb facs="unknown:000231_0004_0FA9ABCA2A75E750"/>
bid him be of good courage and not fear, for the carried <hi>Caesar,</hi> and all
his Fortunes: Surely Jesus Christ and all his promises, in which you
are not a little concerned, is a far better ground of comfort and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
in a stormy season. <hi>Luther</hi> was wont to say, or did once in
a great exigent say, that he had rather <hi>ruere cum Christo quàm stare cum
Caesare;</hi> accounting Christ a better friend, though falling as to the world
to trust to, then <hi>Caesar</hi> standing in power, according to the words of
Christ himself, <hi>greater is he that is in you, then he that is in the World:</hi> So
as all such may say with the Prophet, <hi>Rejoyce not against me O mine enemy;
for when I fall, I shall rise, when I sit in aarkness, the Lord shall be a Light
unto me;</hi> which I trust your selves have had so much experience of, in
these late dark dispensations, that if sometimes you have not seen, yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
you have believed that <hi>Light was sowne for the righteous,</hi> and that
there shall be a cleer breaking forth of the sun, after the tempest is
over; what God hath planted, shall not by man, or any of
Satans Instruments be plucked up. It is with young Colonies, as it
is with trees newly planted, which those winds, as one saith, that are not
so boisterous as to blow down, doe so far advantage as to shake them to
a greater fastness at the root. The Soveraign Ruler of the World doth
usually by such wayes and meanes bring about his peoples good, at the
first, not well understood, nor easily brooked, till the quiet fruit of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness
be discerned to spring up unto all such as are exercised
therein. It hath been no small advantage that the staff of Goverment,
and the shields of this part of the earth were put into your hands (before
the Boar out of the Wood hath broke into this Vineyard) who under God
we trust may be found the repairers of the breach, and the Restorers of

and conduct, are looking unto him, who is promised to be the peace of
his people when the <hi>Assyrian</hi> shall come into their land.</p>
            <p>The consideration of the power wherewith you are invested, together
with the great Wisdome, Faithfulness and Courage by which it hath been
managed by you, in your several stations, hath induced me to desire that
the Historicall discourse ensuing might pass into publick view under the
umbrage of your Protection. If a reason be demanded for the entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

that hath been taken to give all and every one, any way concerned in

some censure or other. It was once by a great man accounted no
small offence in an harmless Poet, that some of his titles were misplaced
as they were marshalled up in their order: If any Historian should com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit

of so many occurrents too hastily drawn up, though true, yet unsea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably,

some material passages. It was intended at the first only as a private es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,

kept of those Warrs, which in opposition to others, were in a peculiar
manner to be called the Warrs of the Lord; and such are these here
treated of, if any, since miraculous deliverances have ceased, may truly
be said to deserve that title. If it had fallen into some ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

your Generation here, your memory like that of the just, may be bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

            <head>An Advertisement to the Reader.</head>
            <p>THe following historical Essay, was when first drawn up, intended only for
the satisfaction of a private Friend, &amp; not for the use of the publick; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hope I may be excused, if I fall short therein of that exactness, which
might be expected from one that designedly undertook a Work of this nature:
however tursting more to the judgment of some who have accidentally had the
perusal thereof, then mine own, I am not unwilling that others should receive be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
thereby. The Compiler of an History can challenge little to himself but
methodizing the work, the materials being found to his hand: diligence in
gathering them together, and faithfulness in improving them, is all that is
upon point required of him, in both which I have endeavoured to make good,
what the profession I have now taken up obliges me unto. The matters of fact
therein related (being rather Massacres, barbarous inhumane outrages, then
acts of Hostility, or valiant atchievements) no more deserve the name of a
VVarre, then the report of them the title of an History, therefore I contented
my self with a Narrative. Much of what is therein mentioned, dep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nding

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ely to be obtained: All Souldiers are not like <hi>Caesar,</hi> able
to describe with their pens, what they have done with their Swords: But the
most material passages inserted, were either gathered out of the Letters, or
taken from the mouthes of such as were eye or ear-witnesses of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves;
and those also persons worthy of credit. In such passages as were va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
reported by the Actors, or Spectators, that which seemed most proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
is only inserted. If any error be committed about the Scituation or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of places, it may deserve an excuse rather then a censure: For our

measured, scarce any vultures eye had ever seen, there was a necessity to take
up many things in reference thereunto upon no better credit sometimes then
common Report. One or two passages need a more particular excuse, or at
least explication As where it is said, <hi>p. 2. that the first Colony was sent

is to be understood with reference to publick acts of Hostility; for particular

               </gap>ncies of like nature were acted by the Indians southward, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

such murthers being too frequently committed in the most peaceable pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
in the world. Such errors as are the forementioned, being overlooked by
the Candid Reader, it is presumed, there will not be many other faults to be
complained of, unless such as are meerly Typographical, or else were ocasioned
by the dropping in of particular passages, after the whole was drawn up,
which I was willing to insert, although it occasioned the discourse in some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
to be a little more confused then else would have been. If ever the matter

            <p>KNown unto God are all his works from the foundation of the
world, though manifest to us, only by the events of time,
that fruitful mother of all things, which in the former age
did bring forth, at least did bring to light the knowledge of
this western World, called <hi>America,</hi> that in all foregoing times and ages,
lay hid in this obscure and remote Region, covered with a veyle of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
and looked up from the knowledge of all the rest of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
of the Earth. To whom the honour of its investigation doth
of eight more properly belong, is sufficiently declared by the Hystory
and Reports of such as were ey witnesses thereof, and not in ended to
be any part of the pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ent disquisition. The most considerable part of
all the North side of <hi>America,</hi> is called <hi>New England.</hi> In the fertility
of the Soyle, salubriousness of the Air, and many other commodious
advantages, most resembling the Country from whence it borrowed
its appellation. For the knowledge thereof the World is most behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the discoveries of the English, under the conduct of <hi>Sebastian
Cabbot</hi> a famous Porreguez about the year 1497. though since much
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000231_0014_0FA9ABD96E9621D8"/>
perfected by the industry and travels of Captain <hi>Gosnold,</hi> Captain <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,</hi>
Captain <hi>Smith,</hi> and others of the English Nation. <hi>North-America</hi>

with her two elder Sisters <hi>Peru</hi> and <hi>Mexico,</hi> yet was suffered to ly in
its Swadling-clothes, one whole Century of years, nature having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
no such Dowry of rich Mines of Silver and Gold to them that
would espouse her for their own, as she did unto the other two, which
possibly was the reason why she was not so hastily deflowred by her first
discoverers, nor yet so early courted by any of the Princes of <hi>Europe,</hi>
lying wholly neglected as it were, until a small company of Planters, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the command of Captain <hi>George Popham,</hi> and Captain <hi>Gilbert</hi> were
sent over at the charge of Sir <hi>Iohn Popham</hi> in the year 1606 to begin a
Colony upon a Tract of Land about <hi>Saga de hoch,</hi> scituate on the south
side of the River of <hi>Kennibeck</hi> and about that called <hi>Shipscot River,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
twenty miles south-West from <hi>Pemmaquid,</hi> the most Northerly
bound of all <hi>New-England.</hi> But that design within two years expiring
with its first Founder, soon after some honourable persons of the West
of <hi>England,</hi> commonly called the Counsel of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> being more
certainly informed of several Navigable Rivers and commodious Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,
with other places fit either for Traffick or Planting, newly disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
by many skilful Navigators, obtained a Grant by Patent, under
the great Seal from King <hi>Iames</hi> of blessed memory, of all that part of
<hi>North America,</hi> called <hi>New-England.</hi> From the 40 to the 48. gr <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd Graunts of Land from <hi>Pemmaquid</hi> to <hi>Delaware Bay,</hi> along
the Sea-coast, derive their Linage and Pedigree; thus was that vast tract
of Land, after the year 1612. cantoned and pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>celled out into many les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser
Divisions and parcels, according as Adventurers presented, which
said Graunts being founded upon uncertain, or false Descriptions, and
Reports of some that Travelled thither, did many of them interfere one
upon another, to the great disturbance of the first Planters, and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice
of the Proprietors themselves, as is too well known by any that have
had occasion to stay never so little amongst them, many of whom are
yet surviving. For notwithstanding the great charge and vast expences
the first Adventurers were at, the first Proprietors of the whole <hi>Province</hi>
of <hi>Mayne</hi> and others (reaching from the head of <hi>Casco Bay</hi> North-east
to the mouth of <hi>Pascataqua River</hi> about sixty miles Westward) and the
hopes they migh have conceived of being the first Founders of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Colonies,</hi>
and of enlarging their Estates and Inheritances by those new
acquired possessions and Lordships, there was little profit reaped from
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000231_0015_0FA9ABDA423A5000"/>
thence, after the rich fleeces of Beaver were gleaned away, nor any great
improvement made of those large portions of Lands, save the erecting
of some few Cottages for Fishermen, and a few inconsiderable Buildings
for the Planters, which were on those occasions drawn over the Sea, to
settle upon the most northerly parts of <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whither it were by the imprudence of the first Adventurers, or
the dissoluteness of the persons they sent over to manage their Affairs,
or whither want of faithfulness or skill to manage their trust, they were
by degrees in a manner quite deserted almost of Laws and Government,
and left to shift for themselves, by which means at last they fell under the
Jurisdiction of the <hi>Massachusets Colony,</hi> not by Usurpation, as is by
great mistake suggested to his <hi>Majesty,</hi> but by necessity, and the earnest
desire of the Planters themselves, to accept of whom, those of the
<hi>Massachusets Colony</hi> were the more easily induced, in that they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
the bounds of their own Patent, by a favourable Interpretation
of the words describing the Northern Line [Three miles beyond the
most Northerly branch of Merimack River] do reach somewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<hi>Pemmaquid,</hi> the North-west limits of all <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the first begining of things in <hi>New-England,</hi> at which time
they were not unlike the times of old, when the people of <hi>Iudah</hi> were
said to be without a Teaching P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iest, and without Law; and no wonder
things were no more successfully carried on.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1620. a Company belonging to Mr. <hi>Robinsons</hi> Church at
<hi>Leyden</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> although they had been courteously entertained by
the <hi>Dutch,</hi> as Strangers sojourning amongst them, yet foreseeing many
inconveniencies like to increase, and that they could not so well provide
for the good of their Posterity, under the Government of a forreign
Nation: they resolved to intreat so much favour from their own Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Prince King <hi>Iames,</hi> as to grant them liberty under the shelter of
his Royal Authority, to place themselves in some part of <hi>New-England,</hi>
then newly discovered; wherefore having obtained some kind of Patent
or Graunt, for some place about <hi>Hudsons River,</hi> they set sayle from <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>
in <hi>September</hi> for the Southern parts of <hi>New-England,</hi> but as they
intended to bend their course thither ward, <hi>per varios casus, per tot dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimina
rerum;</hi> they were at last cast upon a bosome of the South Cape
of the <hi>Massachusets Bay,</hi> called <hi>Cape Cod,</hi> about the 11th of <hi>November,</hi>
from whence the Winter so fast approaching, they had no opportunity to
remove; and finding some incouragement from the hopefulness of the
Soyle, and courtesie of the Heathen, they resolved there to make their
abode for the future, which they did, laying the foundation of a new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000231_0016_0FA9ABDAF46B4020"/>
which from the remembrance of the last Town in <hi>England</hi> they
sailed from, they called <hi>New-Plimouth;</hi> containing no very considerable
Tract of Land, scarce extending an hundred miles in length through the
whole Cape, and scarce half so much in breadth where it is broadest.
The first Founders of that Colony aiming more at Religion then Earthly
Poss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ssions, aspiring not to any large dimension of Land, in their setling
upon those Coasts.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Weymouth</hi> also was a Plantation begun by Mr. <hi>Weston</hi> in the year
1622. but it came to little.</p>
            <p>The North and South Border of the <hi>Massachusets Bay</hi> being thus
planted, the middle part was the more easie to be filled up, which thus
was brought about. Some Gentlemen and others, observing how it
fared with those of <hi>New-Plimouth,</hi> were desiring upon the like ground
to make the same attempt for themselves, wherefore having by a consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
sum of money purchased of the Councell of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> all their
right and interest in a Plantation there begun in the <hi>Massachusets Bay,</hi>
and having attained a confirmation thereof by Patent from King <hi>Charls</hi>
of famous memory, in the year 1628, they sent over a Governour with
several persons to lay some foundation of an other Colony in the <hi>Mas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sachusets
Bay:</hi> and in the year 1630, more of the persons interested in
the said <hi>Patent</hi> (thence commonly called <hi>Patentees</hi>) with several other
persons, intending to venture their lives and all with them, trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
themselves and their Families into the said <hi>Massachusets,</hi> who
did in a short space of time by the accession of many hundreds, who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
year flocked after them, make such increase, that in the space of
five or six years, there were twenty considerable Towns built and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled,
and many of the Towns first planted, became so filled with Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
that like Swarms of Bees they were ready to swarm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, not only
into new Plantations, but into new Colonies, insomuch that in the year
1635 a new Colony began to be planted upon <hi>Connecticut</hi> River, partly
by combination amongst themselves, removing from some Towns about
the <hi>Massachusets Bay,</hi> and partly by the interest of a Patent purchased
of that honourable Gentle man Mr. <hi>Fennick,</hi> Agent for the Lord <hi>Sey,</hi>
and Lord <hi>Brook,</hi> the Lords Proprietors of the said River <hi>Connecticut,</hi> at
the mouth of which River they had built a fort, (called after their own
titles <hi>Sey-Brook Fort</hi>) commanding the passage of the said River. Yea
such was the Confluence of people making over into those parts, that
in the year 1637 a fourth Colony began to be planted, bearing the name

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> inveterate hatred
against the <hi>Mohegins,</hi> that they were every year picking quarrels with
them. The <hi>Mohegins</hi> on the other side though not so numerous, yet
a more warlike people and more politick, alwayes made their recourse
to the English, complaining of the insolencies of the <hi>Narhagansets,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to their League, so as they would hardly be kept from making open

great discontent as he was going home said he would come no more at
<hi>Boston,</hi> wherein he proved a truer prophet then he himself believed when
he uttered the words, for in the end of the same year 1643 making war
upon <hi>Vncas,</hi> he was taken prisoner by him, and soon after by the advice
of the Commissioners of the four Colonyes, (at that time united firmly
into a League offensive and defensive, on which account they were after
that time called the united Colonyes of <hi>New-England:</hi> though since that
time they are reduced but to three Colonyes; that of <hi>New-haven</hi> and
<hi>Connecticot</hi> by the last Patent being conjoyned in one) his head was cut

peace, either betwixt the English and the <hi>Narhagansets,</hi> or betwixt the
<hi>Narhagansets</hi> and the <hi>Mohegins,</hi> while <hi>Miantonimoh</hi> was left alive: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the <hi>Narhagansets</hi> have ever since that time borne an implacable
malice against <hi>Vncas,</hi> and all the <hi>Mohegins,</hi> and for their sakes secretly
against the English, so far as they durst discover it.</p>
            <p>In the years 1645, and 1646. they grew so insolent,
that the Commissioners of the united Colonyes were compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
to raise Forces to go against them, but when they perceived that
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000231_0019_0FA9ABDD32F355C0"/>
the English were in good earnest, they began to be afraid, and sued for
peace, and submitted to pay a tribute to satisfy for the charge of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for the warr, but were alwayes very backward to make payment
untill the English were forced to demand it by new Forces, so that it
appeared they were unwillingly willing to hold any friendly correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with the English, yet durst they never make any open attempt
upon them, untill the present Rebellion, where in that they had no small
land, is too too evident, notwithstanding all their pretences to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary,
as will appear in the sequell of this History.</p>
            <p>Thus it is apparent upon what Terms the English stood with the
<hi>Narhagansets,</hi> ever since the cutting off <hi>Miantonimoh,</hi> their chief Sachems

the Indians and the English, from their first setling in these coasts, there
will appear no ground of quarrell that any of them had against the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,

called also <hi>Woosamequen</hi> (how much soever he affected the English, yet)
was never in the least degree any wayes well affected to the Religion of
the English, but would in his last Treaty with his Neighbours at <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>

               </gap>n Superstition, and Devilish Idolatry, to the Christian
Religion, and did much insist upon it till he saw the English were resolved
never to make any Treaty with him more upon that account, which when
he discerned, he did not further urge it: but that was a bad Omen that
notwithstanding what ever his humanity were to the English, as they
were Strangers) for indeed they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

the great Sachim of that part of the Country, intending at that
time to make his last and farwel speech to his Children and People, that
were then all gathered together, to whom he addressed himself in this
manner:</p>
            <p>I am now going the way of all Flesh, or ready to dy, and not likely to see you
ever met together any more. I will now leave this word of Counsel with you,
that you take heed how you quarrel with the English, for though you may do
them much mischief; yet assuredly you will all be destroyed, and rooted off the
Earth if you do: for, <hi>said he,</hi> I was as much an Enemy to the English, at
their first coming into these parts, as; any one whatsoever, and did try all ways
and means possible to have destroyed them, at least to have prevented them
fitting down here, but I could no way effect it (it is to be noted that this <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s
conaway</hi> was the most noted <hi>Pawaw</hi> and <hi>Sorcerer</hi> of all the Country)
therefore I advise you never to contend with the English, nor make war with
them: And accordingly his eldest Son <hi>Wonnalancet</hi> by name, as soon as he
perceived that the Indians were up in Arms, he withdrew himself into some
remote place, that be might not be burt by the English, or the Enemies, or be in
danger by them.</p>
            <p>This Passage was thought fit to be inserted here, it having so near an
agreement with the former, inmamtting some secret awe of God upon
the hearts of some of the principal amongst them, that they durst not
hurt the English, although they bare no good affection to their
Religion, wherein they seem not a little to imitate <hi>Balaam,</hi> who whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
he uttered, when he was under the awful power of divine illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
yet when left to himself, was as bad an Enemy to the Israel of
God as ever before.</p>
            <p>But to return, whence there hath been this Digreffion:</p>
            <p>After the death of this <hi>Woosamequen</hi> or <hi>Massasoit,</hi> his eldest Son
succeeded him about twenty years since, <hi>Alexander</hi> by name, who not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
the League he had entred into with the English, together
with his Father, in the year 1639. had neither affection to the English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
persons, nor yet to their Religion, but had been plotting with the
<hi>Narhagansets,</hi> to rise against the English; of which the Governour and
Council of <hi>Plimouth</hi> being informed, they presently sent for him to being
him to the Court, the person to whom that service was committed, was
a prudent and resolute Gentleman, the present Governour of the said
Colony, who was neither afraid of Danger, nor yet willing to delay in a
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000231_0022_0FA9ABE1B1B138D0"/>
matter of that moment, he forthwith taking eight or ten stout men with
him well armed, intended to have gone to the said <hi>Alexanders</hi> dwelling,
distant at least forty miles from the Governours house, but by a good
providence, he found him whom he went to seek as an Hunting House,
within six miles of the English Towns, where the said <hi>Alexander</hi> with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
eighty men were newly come in from Hunting, and had left their
Guns without doors, which Major <hi>Winslow</hi> with his small company wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seized, and conveyed away, and then went into the Wigwam, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<hi>Alexander</hi> to go along with him before the Governour, at which
message he was much appalld, but being told by the undaunted Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
that if he stird or refused to go he was a dead man; he was by one
of his chief Counsellors, in whose advice he most confided, perswaded to
go along to the Governours house, but such was the pride and height of
his Spirit, that the very surprizal of him, raised his Choler and indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that it put him into a Feaver, which notwithstanding all possible
means that could be used, seemed Mortal; whereupon intreating those
that held him Prisoner, that he might have liberty to return home, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising
to return again if he recovered, and to send his Son as Hostage till
he could so do; on that consideration he was fairly dismissed, but dyed
before he got half way home: Here let it be observed, that although
some have taken up false Reports, as if the English had compelled him
to go further or faster then he was able, and so fell into a Feaver, or as if
he were not well used by the Physitian that looked to him, while he was
with the English, all which are notoriously false; nor is it to be imagined
that a person of so noble a disposition as is that Gentleman (at that
time imployed to bring him) should himself, or suffer any else to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>civil
to a person allied to them, by his own, as well as his Fathers League
as the said <hi>Philip</hi> also was; nor was any thing of that nature ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to the English of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> by the said <hi>Alexanders Brother,</hi> by
name <hi>Philip,</hi> commonly for his ambitious and haughty Spirit nicknamed
<hi>King-Philip,</hi> when he came in the year 1662. in his own person with
<hi>Sansaman</hi> his Secretary and chief Counsellor to renew the former League
that had been between his Predecessors and the English of <hi>Plimouth:</hi> but
there was as much correspondence betwixt them for the next seven years
as ever had been in any former times, what can be imagined therefore,
besides the instigation of Satan, that either envied at the prosperity of
the Church of God here seated, or else fearing lest the power of the
Lord Jesus, that had overthrown his kingdome in other parts of the
World, should do the like here, and so the stone taken out of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

Brother, yet because of their vicinity, that they might not trespass upon the
Indians did at their own cost set up a very substantial Fence quite cross that
great Neck between the English and the Indians, and payed due damage if at
any time any unruly horse or other beasts brake in and trespassed. And for
diverse years last past (that alloccasion of offence in that respect might be
prevented) the English agreed with <hi>Philip</hi> and his, for a certain sum yearly
to maintain the said Fence, and secure them selves. And if at any time they

the safety of his own life to begin his Rebellion the year before, when the

life had not now been in jeopardy by the guilt of the foresaid Murther
of <hi>Sausaman,</hi> his heart might have failed him, when it should have come
to be put in execution, as it did before in the year 1671. which made one
of his Captains, of far better Courage and resolution then himself, when
he saw his cowardly temper and disposition, fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>esolute Souldier in their quarrel.</p>
            <p>That the Indians had a Conspiracy amongst themselves to rise against
the English, is confirmed by some of the Indians about <hi>Hadly,</hi> although
the plot was not come to maturity when <hi>Philip</hi> began, the special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of God therein overruling the Contrivers: For when the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the troubles first was reported from <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> many of
the Indians were in a kind of a Maze, not knowing well what to doe;
sometimes ready to stand for the English, as formerly they had been
wont to doe; sometimes inclining to strike in with <hi>Philip</hi> (which at the
last they generally did) which if it had been foreseen, much of that mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
might have been prevented that fell out in several places, more by
perfidious and treacherous dealing then any other wayes: the English
never imagining that after so many obliging kindnesses received from
them by the Indians, besides their many engagements and protestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of friendship, as formerly, they would have been so ungratefull,
persideously false and cruel as they have since proved.</p>
            <p>The occasion of <hi>Philips</hi> so sudden taking up armes the last year was
this, There was one <hi>Iohn Sausaman</hi> a very cunning and plausible Indian
well skilled in the English language, and bred up in the profession of
Christian Religion, imployed as a Schoolmaster at <hi>Natick,</hi> the Indian
Town, who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> upon some misdemeanour fled from his place to <hi>Philip,</hi> by
whom he was entertained in the room and office of a Secretary, and his
chief Counsellor, whome he trusted with all his affairs and secret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels:
But afterwards, whither upon the sting of his own Conscience;
or by the frequent Sollicitations of Mr. <hi>Eliot,</hi> that had known him from
a childe, and instructed him in the principles of our Religion, who was
often laying before him the heinous sin of his apostacy, and r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>urning
back to his old vomit, he was at last prevailed with to for sake <hi>Philip,</hi>
and return back to the Christian Indians at <hi>Natick,</hi> where he was
haptized, manifesting publick Repentance for all his former offences,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000231_0027_0FA9ABE9F1728220"/>
and made a serious Prosession of the Christian Religion: and did apply
himself to Preach to the Indians, wherein he was better gifted then any
other of the Indian Nation; so as he was observed to conforme more
to the English manners then any other Indian: yet having occasion to
go up with some others of his Country-men to Namasket; whither for
the advantage of Fishing, or some such occasion, it matters not; being
there not far from <hi>Philips Country,</hi> he had occasion to be much in the
Company of <hi>Philips Indians,</hi> and of <hi>Philip</hi> himself: by which means he
discerned by several circumstances, that the Indians were plotting
anew against us; the which out of faithfulness to the <hi>English,</hi> the said
<hi>Sausaman</hi> informed the Governour of, adding also, that if it were
known that he revealed it, he knew they would presently kill him.
There appearing so many concurrent testimonies from others, making
it the more probable, that there was a certain truth in the information,
some inquiry was made into the business, by examining <hi>Philip</hi> himself, &amp;
several of his Indians, who although they would own nothing; yet could
not free themselves from just suspicion; <hi>Philip</hi> therefore soon after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
the said <hi>Sausamans</hi> death, which was strangely discovered; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
it was so cunningly effected, for they that murdered him
met him upon the Ice on a great Pond, and presently after they had
knocked him down, put him under the Ice, yet leaving his Gun and his
Hat upon the Ice, that it might be thought he fell in accidentally through
the Ice and was drowned: but being missed by his friends, who finding
his Hat and his Gun, they were thereby led to the place, where his body
was found under the Ice: when they took him up to bury him, some of
his friends, specially one <hi>David</hi> observed some bruises about his Head,
which made them suspect he was first knocked down, before he was put
into the water, however, they buried him near about the place where
he was found, without making any further inquiry at present: never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless
<hi>David</hi> his friend, reported these things to some English at Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
(a Town not far from <hi>Namasket)</hi> it occasioned the Governour to
inquire further into the business, wisely considering, that as <hi>Sansaman</hi>
had told him, that if it were known, that he had revealed any of their
plots, they would murder him for his pains: wherefore by special War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
the body of <hi>Sansaman</hi> being digged again out of his Grave, it was
very apparent that he had been killed and not drowned. And by a
strange providence, an Indian was found, that by accident standing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seen
upon a Hill, had seen them murdering the said <hi>Sansaman,</hi> but dirst
never reveal it for fear of losing his own life likewise, until he was called
to the Court at <hi>Plimouth,</hi> or before the Governour, where he plainly
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000231_0028_0FA9ABEAD1EB8E10"/>
confessed what he had seen. The Murderers being apprehended, were
convicted by his undeniub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and so were all put to death, being but three in number; the last
of them confessed immediately before his death, that his Father (one of
the Councellers and special Friends of <hi>Philip)</hi> was one of the two that
murdered <hi>Sansaman,</hi> himself only looking on. This was done at <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth
Court.</hi> held in <hi>Iune</hi> 1675. insomuch that <hi>Philip,</hi> apprehending the
danger his own head was in next, never used any further means to clear
himself from what was like to be laid to his charge, either about his plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
against the English, nor yet about <hi>Sansamans</hi> death: but by keeping
his men continually about him in Arms, and gathering what Strangers
he could to joyn with him, marching up and down constantly in Arms,
both all the while the Court sat, as well as afterwards; the English of
<hi>Plimouth</hi> hearing of all this, yet took no further notice, then only to
order a Military Watch in all the adjacent Towns, hoping that <hi>Philip</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himself not likely to be Arraigned by Order of the said Court, the
present Cloud might blow over, as some others of like nature had done
before; but in conclusion, the matter proved otherwise, for <hi>Philip</hi> find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his Strength daily increasing, by the flocking of Neighbour Indians
unto him, and sending over their Wives and Children to the <hi>Narhagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets</hi>
for security (as they use to do when they intend War with any of
their Enemies) Immediately they began to Alarm the English at <hi>Swanzy</hi>
(the next Town to <hi>Philips</hi> Country) as it were daring the English to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,
at last their insolencies grew to such an height, that they began not
only to use threatning words to the English, but also to kill their Cattle
and rifle their houses; whereat an English man was so provoked, that
he let fly a Gun at an Indian, but did only wound, not kill him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
the Indians immediately began to kill all the <hi>English</hi> they could, so
as on the 24th. of <hi>Iune</hi> 1675. was the Alarm of war first f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that day, whereby they killed one and wounded others, and then like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
at the same time, they slew two Men on the High-way, sent to call a
Surgeon, and barbarously the same day murdered six men in and about a
dwelling House in an other part of the Town, all which outrages were
committed so suddenly, that the <hi>English</hi> had no time to make any resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance:
For on the 14th. of the same Month, besides endeavours used
by Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> of <hi>Swanzy</hi> one of the <hi>Magistrates</hi> of <hi>Plimouth</hi> Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
an amicable Letter was sent from the Council of <hi>Plimouth</hi> to <hi>Philip</hi>

shewing their dislike of his prastises, and advising him to dismiss his

manifested no inclination to peace, they immediately sent up what Forces

as were defired: But in the mean time two Messengers were dispatched

to the like Tragedy; so the present warre might by the same meanes
have been now turned aside: For in the said year <hi>Philip</hi> had firmly
engaged himself, when he was at <hi>Boston,</hi> not to quarrel with <hi>Plimouth</hi>
untill he had first addressed himself to the <hi>Massachusets</hi> for advice and
approhation: But the two Messengers aforesaid, finding the men slain
in the Roade <hi>Iune</hi> 24. as they were going for the Surgeon, apprehended
it no safe to proceed any further, considering also, that a peace now
could not honourably be concluded after such barbarous outrages
committed upon some of the neighbour Colony: Wherefore
returning with all speed to <hi>Boston,</hi> the <hi>Massachuset</hi> Forces were dispatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away with all immaginable hast, as the ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gent of the matter did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
some of them being then upon, or ready for their March, the rest
were ordered to follow after, as they could be raised. The sending
forth of which, because it was the first engagement in any warlike pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations
against the Indians, shall be more particularly declared.</p>
            <p>On the 26th. of <hi>Iune</hi> a Foot-Company under Capt. <hi>Dani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>l Henchman,</hi>
with a Troop under Capt. <hi>Thomas Prentice,</hi> were sent out of <hi>Boston</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Mount-Hope;</hi> it being late in the afternoon before they began to
march, the central Echpse of the Moon in <hi>Capric.</hi> hapned in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
before they came up to <hi>Naponset River,</hi> about twenty miles from
<hi>Boston,</hi> which occasioned them to make an halt, for a little repast, till
the moon recovered her light again. Some melancholy Fancyes would
not be perswaded, but that the Eclipse falling out at that instant of time,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000231_0030_0FA9ABEC4DA0C118"/>
was ominous, concriving also that in the centre of the Moon they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
an unusual black spot, not a little resembling the scalp of an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian:</hi>
As some others not long before, imagined they saw the form of
an <hi>Indian Bow,</hi> accounting that likewise ominous (although the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
following was done by Guns, not by Bows) both the one and the
other, might rather have thought of what <hi>Marcus Crassus</hi> the <hi>Koman
General,</hi> going forth with an Army against the <hi>Parthians,</hi> once wisely
replied to a private Souldier, that would have disswaded him from mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
that time, because of an Eclpse of the Moon in <hi>Capricorn [That
he was more afraid of Sagitarius then of Capricornus]</hi> meaning the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows
of the <hi>Parthians</hi> (accounted very good Archers) from whom
as things then fell out, was his greatest danger. But after the Moon
had waded through the dark shadow of the Earth, and borrowed her
Light again, by the help thereof, the two Companies marched on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Woodcocks</hi> House, thirty miles from <hi>Boston,</hi> where they arrived next
morning; and there retarded their motion till the afternoon, in hope of
being overtaken by a Company of <hi>Volunteers,</hi> under the Command of
Captain <hi>Samuel Mosely,</hi> which accordingly came to pass, as on <hi>Iune</hi>
28th. they all arrived at <hi>Swanzy,</hi> where by the advice of Captain <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth,</hi>
the Commander in chief of <hi>Plimouth Forces,</hi> they were removed
to the Head Quarters, which for that time were appointed at Mr. <hi>Miles</hi>
his house, the Minister of <hi>Swanzy,</hi> within a quarter of a mile of the
Bridge, leading into <hi>Philips Lands.</hi> They arriving there some little
time before night, twelve of the Troop unwilling to loose time passed
over the Bridge, for discovery into the Enemies Territories, where they
found the rude welcome of eight or ten Indians firing upon them out of
the Bushes, killing one <hi>William Hammond,</hi> wounding Corporal <hi>Belcher,</hi>
his Horse being also shot down under him; the rest of the sard Tropers
having discharged upon those <hi>Indians</hi> that ran away after their first
shot, carried off their two dead and wounded Companions, and so reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

to march into <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> and there beat up the Enemys quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

doubtful, our Forces did not march till near noon, about which time
they set out, with a Troop of Horse in each wing, to prevent the danger
of the Enemies Ambuscadoes; after they had marched about a mile &amp;
and half, they passed by some Houses newly burned: not far of one of
them they found a Bible newly torn, and the leaves scattered about by
the Enemy, in hatred of our Religion therein revealed, two or three
miles further they came up with some Heads, Scalps, and Hands cut off
from the bodys of some of the English, and stuck upon Poles near the
Highway, in that barbarous and inhumane manner bidding us Defyance,
the Commander in chief giving Order that those monuments of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies

Field, without any shelter, notwithstanding the abundance of rain that

fell, and in the morning, despairing to meet with any enemy on <hi>Mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Hope,</hi>
they retreated back to their Quarters at <hi>Swanzy,</hi> in the way
meeting with many Indian dogs, that seemed to have lost their Masters.
That night Capt. <hi>Prentice</hi> his Troop for convenie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>to a Swampe. Those with Leiutenant <hi>Oakes</hi> had the like
discovery, but with better success, as to the advantage of the ground,
so as pursuing of them upon a plain, they slew four or five of them in the
Chase, whereof one was known to be <hi>Thebe</hi> a Sachem of <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi>
another of them was a chief Counsellor of <hi>Philips;</hi> yet in this attempt
the Lieutenant lost one of his company, <hi>Iohn Druce</hi> by name, who was
mortally wounded in his bowels, whereof he soon after dyed, to the
great grief of his companions. After the said Troop came up to the
Head-Quarters at <hi>Swanzy,</hi> they understood from Capt. <hi>Cudworth</hi> that
the enemy were discovered upon <hi>Pocass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t,</hi> an other neck of Land lying
over an arme of the Sea, more towards <hi>Cape Cod:</hi> However it was
resolved that a more narrow search should be made after them, both
upon <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> and upon the ground between <hi>Swanzy</hi> and <hi>Rehoboth</hi>
to scoure the Swamps, and assault them if they could find where they
were entrenched. Capt. <hi>Henchman</hi> and Capt. <hi>Preentice</hi> were ordered to
search the Swamps; while Capt. <hi>Mosely</hi> and Capt. <hi>Paige</hi> with his Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goons
attending on Major <hi>Savage,</hi> should return back into <hi>Mount hope</hi>
that they might be sure to leave none of the enemy behind them, when
they should remove to pursue them elsewhere.</p>
            <p>About ten a clock the next morning, <hi>Iuly.</hi> 4. Capt. <hi>Henchman</hi> after
a long and tedious March, came to the Head Quarters, and informed
that he came upon a place where the enemy had newly been that night,
but were escaped out of his reach: But that night before they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
of any other motion, Capt. <hi>Hutchinson</hi> came up from <hi>Boston</hi>
with new Orders for them to pass into <hi>Narrhaganset,</hi> to treat with the
Sachems there, and if it might be, to prevent their joyning with <hi>Philip.</hi>
Capt. <hi>Cudworth,</hi> by this time was come up to the Head Quarters, having
left a Garison of fourty men upon <hi>Mount-Hope</hi> Neck. The next mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
was spent in consultations how to carry on the Treaty; it was then
resolved, that they should goe to make a peace with a Sword in their

hands, having no smal ground of suspition that the said <hi>Narhagansets</hi> might
joyn with the enemy wherefore, they thought it necessary to carry all
the <hi>Messachuset</hi> Forces over into the <hi>Narhaganset</hi> Country, to fight
them if there should be need; Capt. <hi>Mosely</hi> passed over by water
to attend Capt. <hi>Hutchinson</hi> in his dispatch; the other Companys with

night, in traversing the said <hi>Pocasset Neck,</hi> and Watching all night in
an House which they found there, yet could head no tidings of any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians;
insom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ch that Captain <hi>Fuller</hi> began to be weary of his design:
Mr. <hi>Church</hi> in the mean while ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ring him that they should finde Indians
before it were long: yet for greater expedition they divided their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
Captain <hi>Fuller</hi> taking down toward the Sea-side, where it seems
after some little skirmishing with them, wherein one man only received
a small Wound, he either saw or heard too many Indians for himself and
his Company to deal with, which m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de him and them betake themselves
to an House near the Water-side, from whence they were fetched off by
a Sloop before night to <hi>Road Island.</hi> Captain <hi>Church</hi> (for so may he
well be stiled after this time) marched further into the Neck, imag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ning
that if there were Indians in the Neck, they should finde them about a
peas-field not farr off: as soon as ever they came near the said field
he espyed two Indians in the pease, who also had at the same time espyed
him, and presently making some kind of shout, a great number of Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
came about the field, pursuing the said Capt. <hi>Church</hi> and his men
in great numbers to the sea side: there being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> above fifteen with
<hi>Church,</hi> yet seven or eight score of the Indians pursuing after them. Now
was a fit time for this young Captain and his small Company to handsel
their valour upon this great rout of Indians, just ready to devo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> them:
But victory stands no more in the number of Soulders, then Verity in
the plurality of voyces: And although some of these fifteen had scarce
courage enough for themselves, yet their Captain had enough for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and some to spare for his friends, which he there had an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of improving to the full. When he saw the hearts of any of his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers
to fail, he would bid them be of good Courage and fight stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and (possibly by some divine impression upon his heart) assured them
not a bullet of the enemy should hurt any one of them; which one of the
Company, more dismayed then the rest, could hardly believe, till he
saw the proof of it in his own person, for the Captain perceiving the man
was not able to fight, made him gather Rocks together for a kind of
shelter and Baricado: for the rest, that must either of necessity fight or
fall by the enemyes. It chanced as this faint-hearted souldier had a flat
stone in his armes, and was carying it to the shelter that he was making
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000231_0037_0FA9ABF24FF72880"/>
upon the Bank, a bullet of the Enemy was thus warded from his Body
by which he must else have perished, which experience put new life into
him, so as he followed his business very ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fully afterward, insomuch
that they defended themselves under small defence hastily made up all
that afternoon, not one being either sl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>in or wounded, yet it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
known that they killed at least fifteen of their Enemies: and at the
last, when they had spent all their Amunition, and made their Guns un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviceable
by often fiting, they were fetched all off by Capt. <hi>Goldings</hi>
Sloop, and carried safe to <hi>Road-Island</hi> in despight of all their Enemies;
yea, such was the bold and undaunted courage of this Champion Capt.
<hi>Church,</hi> that he was not willing to leave any token behind of their flying
for want of courage, that in the face of his Enemies he went back to
fetch his Hat, which he had left at a Spring, whether the extream heat
of the weather, and his labou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for the quenching of his thirst an hour or two before. It seems
in the former part of the same day, five men coming from <hi>Road-Island,</hi>
to look up their Cattle upon <hi>Pocasset Neck,</hi> were assaulted by the same
<hi>Indians,</hi> and one of the five was Capt. <hi>Churches</hi> Servant, who had his
Leg broke in the Skirmish, the rest hardly escaping with their lives: this
was the first time that ever any mischief was done by the <hi>Indians</hi> upon

themselves, as well as the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ult rather heightened and increased then daunted the courage
of Capt. <hi>Church;</hi> for not making a cowardly flight, but a fair retreat,
which providence offered him by the Sloop aforesaid, after his Amunition
was spent, he did not stay long at <hi>Road Island,</hi> but hasted over to the
<hi>Mattachuset Forces,</hi> and borrowing three files of Men of Capt. <hi>Hench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
with his Lieutenant: Mr. <hi>Church</hi> and he returned again to <hi>Pocasset,</hi>
where they had another skirmish with the Enemy, wherein some few of

themselves to no purpose, yet it was said one half hour more would have
at that time utterly subdued <hi>Philip</hi> and all his power. The Commander

return to king <hi>Philip,</hi> who was now lodged in the great swampe upon
<hi>Pocasset Neck,</hi> of seven miles long: Capt. <hi>Henchman</hi> and the <hi>Plimouth</hi>
Forces kept a diligent eye upon the enemy, but were not willing to run
into the mire and dirt after them in a dark Swamp being taught by late
experience how dangerous it is to fight in such dismal Woods, when
their eyes were muffled with the leaves, and their heads pinnioned with
the thick boughs of the trees, as their feet were continually shackled
with the roots spreading every way in those boggy Woods. It is ill
fighting with a wilde Beast in his own den. They resolved therefore to
starve them out of the Swamp, where they knew full well they could

beleaguer the enemy, and prevent his escape out of the place, where they
thought they had him fast enough. <hi>Philip</hi> in the mean time was not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of what was doing without, and was ready therein to read his

fall into their hands from whom he could expect no mercy: The c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

being sufficiently guarded by the English Forces. The Swampe where

that no flesh might glory in their own Wisdome, but give unto God
the praise of all their Successes, and quietly bear whatever Miscariages he
hath ordered to befall them. It appears by the issue of these things, that
although this wound was not incurable, yet much more bloud must be
taken away before it could be healed. But by this means <hi>Philip</hi> escaped
away to the Westward, kindling the flame of Warre in all the Western
plantations of the <hi>Massachusets</hi> Colony wherever he came, so that by
this fatal accident, the fire that was in a likely way to be extinguished, as

and advising what was to be done for preventing the mischief

hath appeared, all this was but to gain time, and cover their treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
intents and purposes, that they might in the next Spring fall upon
the English plantations all at once, as some prisoners lately brought in
have owned and confessed; not have any of those Indians with whom
the present War hath been, ever regarded any agreements of peace made

that they would all be ruined if they made War with the <hi>English,</hi>

were almost miraculously defeated of their purpose by the immediate

The occasion which b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

in pursuance of his Commission from the Governour and Council, was
upon Wednesday <hi>August the 4th</hi> in the morning, marching out after
some <hi>Indians</hi> to the Westward, to secure them: just as they were set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth, some of <hi>Malberough,</hi> who had intelligence by those that were
going to <hi>Connecticot,</hi> and forced to return, what distress <hi>Brookfield</hi> was
in, and knowing of Major <hi>Willards</hi> purpose to go out that morning
from <hi>Lancaster,</hi> sent a Post to acquaint him therewith, which though it
did not find him in the Town, yet overtook him before he had gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
four or five miles from the place: whereupon, conceiving it more
needful to succour <hi>Brookfield</hi> in so eminent danger, then to proceed fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
upon his intended design: he altered his course and marched di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
thither, being about thirty miles distant when the tidings were
b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ought him; so he arrived there that night very seasonably, about an
hour af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er it was dark, or else in probability they had all perished before
the relief sent up from <hi>Boston</hi> could have reached them, which was not
till three dayes after. The providence of God l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>kewise in bringing in
the said Major so safely, as well as seasonably to their relief, was very
remarkable. For the <hi>Indians</hi> had subtilly contrived to cut off all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

sent, before it could come at them, by laying Ambushes, and placing
their Scou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s, at two or three miles distance round the Town: About an
hundred of them were lodged at an house not far off in the way toward
<hi>Boston,</hi> to cut off any Succour that might come from thence: but it is
supposed they were so intense upon the project they were about for
firing the House, concluding it would without fail take place, that either
they d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d not minde their business of Watching, or making such a noise
for joy thereof, that they did not bear their Sentinels when they shot off
their Guns, at two miles distance. It is said that another party of the
<hi>Indians,</hi> let the Major and his Company purposely pass by them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:000231_0046_0FA9ABFFC4150758"/>
any opposition, waiting for the blow to be given at their first ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
near the house, then to have themselves fallen upon their Rear,
and so to have cut them all off, before the besieged understood any thing
thereof. But it pleased God so to order things in providence, that no
notice was taken of them by the Besiegers, nor were they at all discerned
by them till they had made themselves known to their Friends; and were
admitted within the Court of Guard; which when the Enemy had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of, they poured in their shot abundantly upon them, but they
were now sheltered from the danger thereof: only it seems their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
were exposed to their fury, so as many of them were ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>med and
killed, as were most of the Cattle belonging to the Inhabitants of the
place soon after. This Honoured Person Major <hi>Willard</hi> continued at
<hi>Brookfield</hi> after this famous exploit for the preservation of the poor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged
at <hi>Brookfield,</hi> divers weeks to order such Companies as were sent
up that way for the securing of the Plantations on that side of the
Country; and not long after he went himself also to <hi>Hadly</hi> upon the
like service of the Country in the present War: But after some time
spent in those parts, he returned back to his own place, to order the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of his own Regiment, much needing his presence, and leaving the
Forces about <hi>Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ly</hi> under the command of the Major of that Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But to return to what was in hand before, after the Indians under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood

they had left standing for their own shelter while they had beseiged the
place before mentioned, ran all away into their own dens, in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring

the enemy had eighty of their men k<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

But ere we pass any further in pursuit of the History of these matters,
it will not be amiss to let the Reader understand the horrible perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and treacherous dealing of these <hi>Nipnet Indians,</hi> who of all other
had the least reason as to any pretence of injury, yet did most deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
and barbarously joyn with <hi>Philip</hi> and his Indians, after they had
been several times sent unto by the Governour and Council of the
<hi>Massachusets,</hi> by the advice of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> to have prevented their R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

as well as the rising of the <hi>Narhagansets,</hi> and also had faithfully promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
not to meddle in the quarrel, as may more fully appear by the
Engagement under the hands of their Sachems, some time before Capt.

under their hand and oath, <hi>Iuly</hi> 24. 75. when Leiut. <hi>Ephraim Curtice</hi>
spake with five of the <hi>Nipnet</hi> Sachems, four too many to govern so small
a people, but lying upon the head of the principal Indian Territoryes,
they were divided into so many small partyes, two of whom, <hi>viz. Sam</hi>
Sachem of <hi>wesh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

at <hi>Boston.</hi> All of them did at that time solemnly renew their Covenant
and promise under their hands to come to <hi>Boston</hi> to speak further with
the Governour, instead of which what they perfidiously did against Capt
<hi>Hutchinson</hi> and others, hath already been declared.</p>
            <p>Upon the report of this sad Disaster that befel the Inhabitants of
<hi>Brookefield,</hi> Forces were sent up under the Command of Capt. <hi>Lothrop</hi>
and others, to pursue after those Indians, harbouring about those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and if it might be, to prevent them from joyning with the Indians
upon <hi>Connecticut River,</hi> who as yet had not discovered themselves as
willing to espouse <hi>Philips</hi> interest, but rather made some semblance to
the contrary. There was much time spent by Major <hi>Willard,</hi> and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Companyes of Souldiers left under his command, about the <hi>Nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi>
Country, but all to no purpose; for partly by the treachery of some
of the Indians that came to their assistance, that seemed to favour the
English, but rather acted in behalf of the enemy, partly by the subtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes
of the enemyes themselves, who could easily by their scouts disc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rn
the approach of our souldiers, and by the nimbleness of their feet escape
them: our Souldiers could never meet with any of them, but only by
that means driving them further Westward, they gathered all the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
they could to their party about <hi>Pecomptuck.</hi> aliàs <hi>Dearfield, Swams<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot,</hi>
and <hi>Squakeag,</hi> where were some plantations of the English newly
began, whom they assaulted in the next place, and did what mischief
they could upon them.</p>
            <p>It is here to be noted that although that worthy patriot and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced
Souldier Major <hi>Willard</hi> hearing of the distress of <hi>Brookefield</hi> by
some that were travelling to <hi>Connecticut</hi> was the first that relieved the

<hi>Springfield</hi> also by accident hearing of their Calamity, had not only sent
word thereof to <hi>Hartford</hi> (from whom he received a supply of five and
twenty or thirty souldiers under Capt. <hi>Wats</hi>) but did also send a Band
of men under Lieut. <hi>Cooper</hi> (who was afterwards villanously slain by
<hi>Springfield</hi> Indians) who with those sent from <hi>Hartford,</hi> and some Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
belonging to <hi>Springfield</hi> (seemingly forward to help the English)
made up four score or thereabouts; these marched down to <hi>Brook<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the same day that Capt <hi>Lothrop</hi> and Capt. <hi>Beens</hi> came up from the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:000231_0048_0FA9AC014B7AA8E0"/>
               <hi>Massachusets,</hi> who having spent some time in searching the woods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<hi>Springfield,</hi> and finding none of the Indians, did the next day march
up to a place called <hi>Memini<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>isset</hi> by the Indians, where Capt. <hi>Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
and Capt. <hi>Wheeler</hi> were assaulted, and finding no sign of any Indians
amongst those woods and Swamps; the Company that came from
<hi>Springfield,</hi> left the other Souldiers (who returned to their Quarters at
<hi>Brookfield</hi>) and went up themselves further northward, at least twenty
miles from the said <hi>Brookfield,</hi> and finding no track of Indians in all
those woods, they returned back to <hi>Springfield,</hi> leaving enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
the people of <hi>Brookefield,</hi> and the garison there.</p>
            <p>By this it appears, that the Indians by this occasion were driven more
westward into the woods between <hi>Hadly</hi> and <hi>Squakheag.</hi> where they
soon effected their design, <hi>viz.</hi> to leaven the Indians on that side the
Country with the same prejudice and malice against the English, with
which they themselves were (though without cause) in bittered; for
in a few dayes the device took place amongst <hi>Hadly</hi> and <hi>Dearfield</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,
and was presently put in execution by the said Indians, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
from the English and assisting <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Nipnets</hi> to
spoile and destroy all the towns westward, as soon after came to
pass: yet at the first some of the <hi>Hadly</hi> Indians pretended real friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship
to the English, and offered themselves to fight against <hi>Philip,</hi> but
the <hi>Mohegin Indians</hi> that came afterward from <hi>Harford</hi> began to
suspect the Treachery of the other, and told the <hi>English</hi> plainly, that no
good would be done, while any of that Company went along with them
in pursuit of the Enemy, for as was said, they would alwayes give some
shout when they came near the Enemy, as if they should thereby wish
them to look to themselves; insomuch that the said <hi>Hadly Indians</hi> fell
into great suspicion with the <hi>English,</hi> and for a proof of their Fidelity,
they were required to bring in their Arms to the <hi>English,</hi> but upon
that motion they delayed a little, but that very night they fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d away from
their Dwellings, which was in a Wooden Fortification, within a mile of
<hi>Hatfield,</hi> whereby they plainly discovered that they had secretly plotted
to joyn with <hi>Philips</hi> Party, as far as they had an opportunity to do them
any eminent service: some think the English failed in point of prudence
not managing that business so warily as they might, which if they had
done, their de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ection had been prevented, but it is most probable that
<hi>Philip</hi> had hired them to own his quarrel, by sending them gifts in the
Spring, and that the body of the said <hi>Indians</hi> were most readily inclined
thereunto: But the Sachims and the elder ones of them, seemed loth

               </gap>t first to engage against the <hi>English.</hi> In conclusion, when they had so
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:000231_0049_0FA9AC01FAA81D00"/>
falsly left their Dwellings, and were running after <hi>Philip</hi> and the <hi>Nip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
Indians</hi> (at that time harboured in those Woods) the <hi>English</hi> were
so provoked, that were under Capt. <hi>Lothrop</hi> and Capt. <hi>Beers,</hi> that they
pursued after them very early the next morning, and overtook them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ten miles above <hi>Hatfield,</hi> at a place called <hi>Sugar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

small skirmish with them, wherein there were nine or ten of the <hi>English</hi>
slain, and about twenty six <hi>Indians:</hi> yet the rest escaped; and so joyned
with <hi>Philip</hi> and his Company, presently after which accident, they were
so emboldned, that upon the first of <hi>September,</hi> about seven dayes after
they set upon <hi>Dearfield,</hi> killed one Man, and laid most of the Houses in
ashes. About two or three dayes after they fell upon <hi>Squakeag,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
new Plantation, fifteen miles higher up the River, above <hi>Dearfield,</hi>
where they killed nine or ten of the People, the rest hardly escaped into
the Garison house.</p>
            <p>The next day, this disaster not being known, Captain <hi>Beers,</hi> for
fear of the worst, with thirty six men, was sent up to the said <hi>Squakeag,</hi>
with supplies both of men and provision to secure the small Garison
there, but before they came very near to the Town, they were set upon
by many hundreds of the <hi>Indians</hi> out of the Bushes by a Swamp side, of
whom Capt. <hi>Beers</hi> (who was known to fight valiantly to the very last)
with about twenty of his men, were by this sudden surprisal there slain,
the rest flying back to <hi>Hadly.</hi> Here the Barbarous Villains shewed
their insolent rage and cruelty, more then ever before, cutting off the
heads of some of the slain, and fixing them upon Poles near the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,
and not only so, but one (if not more) was found with a Chain
hooked into his under jaw, and so hung up on the Bow of a Tree, (tis
feared he was hung up alive) by which means they thought to daunt
and discourage any that might come to their relief, and also to terrifie
those that should be Spectators with the beholding so sad an object: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch
that Major <hi>Treat</hi> with his Company, going up two days after,
to fetch off the residue of the Garison, were solemnly affected with that
doleful fight, which made them make the more hast to bring down the
Garison, not waiting for any opportunity to take revenge upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
having but an hundred with him, two few for such a purpose. Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<hi>Appleton</hi> going up after him, met him coming down, and would
willingly have perswaded them, to have turned back, to see if they could
have made any spoil upon the Enemy, but the greatest part advised to
the contrary, so that they were all forced to return, with what they
could carry away, leaving the rest for a booty to the Enemy, who shall
ere long pay a sad reckoning for their Robberies and Cruelties, in the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:000231_0050_0FA9AC02B7267820"/>
time appointed: but the sufferings of the <hi>English</hi> were not as yet come
to their height, for after they were come to <hi>Hadly,</hi> the Commander in
chief taking Counsel with the Officers of the Souldiers, ordered them
that were then present to Garison the Towns about; some to be at
<hi>North-Hampton, Hat field, Dearfield,</hi> and some to remain at <hi>Hadly</hi> where
were the Head-quarters of the <hi>English.</hi> But perceiving that little good
was to be done upon the Enemy in those parts, it was agreed that what
Corn was left at <hi>Dearfield,</hi> being threshed out as well as they could in
those tumults (about three thousand Bushels was supposed to be there
standing in stacks) should be brought to <hi>Hadly,</hi> and wait further time to
fight the Enemy. It came to C. <hi>Lothrops</hi> turn, or rather it was his choice
with about eighty men to guard several Carts laden with Corn, &amp; other
Goods, the Company under Capt. <hi>Mosely</hi> then quartering at <hi>Dearfield</hi>
intended that day to pursue after the Enemy. But upon <hi>September</hi> 18. that
most fatal day, the saddest that ever befel <hi>New-England,</hi> as the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
were marching along with the Carts (it may be too securely) never
apprehending danger so near, were suddenly set upon, and almost all
cut off (not above seven or eight escaping) which great defeat came
to pass by the unadvised proceeding of the Captain (who was himself
slain in the first assault) although he wanted neither courage nor skill,
to lead his Souldiers; but having taken up a wrong notion about the
best way and manner of fighting with the <hi>Indians</hi> (which he was always
wont to argue for) <hi>viz.</hi> that it were best to deal with the <hi>Indians</hi> in
their own way, <hi>sc.</hi> by skulking behind Trees. and taking their aim at
single persons, which is the usual manner of the <hi>Indians</hi> fighting one
with another, but herein was his great mistake, in not considering the
great disadvantage a smaller Company would have in dealing that way
with a greater multitude: for if five have to deal with one, they may
surround him, and every one take his aim at him, while he can level but
at one of his Enemies at a time: which gross mistake of his, was the
ruine of a choice company of young men, the very flower of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of <hi>Essex,</hi> all culled out of the Towns belonging to that County, none
of which were ashamed to speak with the Enemy in the gate: their dear
Relations at home mourning for them, like <hi>Rachil</hi> for her children, and
would not be comforted, not only because they were not, but because
they were so miserably lost. (The like mistake was conceived to be the
reason of the loss of the former persons, slain with the said <hi>Lothrop,</hi>
pursuing the <hi>Indians</hi> that ran away from <hi>Hadly,</hi> and of the twenty

and at the last a few got to their Horses soon after their Captain was

shot down.) For had he ordered his men to March in a Body, as some
of his fellow-Commanders advised, either backward, or forward, in
reason, they had not lost a quarter of the number of them that fell that
day by the edge of the Sword. For the Indians, notwithstanding their
sublety and cruelty, durst not look an <hi>Englishman</hi> in the fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>m, in an ambush, or behind some
shelter, taking aim undiscovered; so that although it was judged by
those that escaped, that there was seven or eight hundred <hi>Indians</hi> at least
that encountred that Company of eighty of <hi>English,</hi> yet if they had

               </gap>pt together in a Body, and fought Marching, they might have escaped
the numbers of the Enemy, with little loss in comparison of what they
sustained. For the valiant and successful Capt. <hi>Mosely,</hi> and his Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant,
coming<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though too late) to their rescue, marched through
and through that great body of <hi>Indians,</hi> and yet came off with little or
no loss in comparison of the other. And having fought all those <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
for five or six hours upon a march, lost not above two men all that
while, nor received other damage besides eight or nine that were woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
which yet were carried to their quarters at night at <hi>Hatfield</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
if these had proceeded in the same way of fighting as Capt. <hi>Lothrop</hi>
did in the morning, they might have been surrounded, and so have been
served as the former were: but God had other wise determined in his

such a restraint upon them, that when they passed very near the Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
house at <hi>Dearfield</hi> (wherein were not left above twenty seven
souldiers) their Captain using this strategem, to cause his trumpet to
sound as if he had another troop near by to be called together, they

Arms under their Cart, so as being destitute of means to make their

that night: to that end, they mounted two and twenty upon
Horses, riding up ten miles into the Woods, and when they came near
the Wigwams, they dismounted, and intended presently to march up,
and give an assault upon them, after they had first made a shout to fright
the Enemy: they ordered one half to follow the Lieutenant, the other
to follow the Captain, when they came within a quarter of a mile of the
place, their Dogs began to bark, at which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

easily be repaired: however the Enemy presently deserted the Wigwan
and gave our men the next day an opportunity to fetch off their two
dead men, and bury them, and so with grief and shame were constrained
to return to their quarters at <hi>Mendham,</hi> to whose Inhabitants they
gave notice of 200 bushels of Corn belonging to the Indians, that
might have been preserved, which for want of hands was lost by the fire,
that the Enemy might not be benefited thereby. It appears by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
passage, that the time of our deliverance was not yet come, and
that God had further tryals to acquaint us with before he would turn
his hand upon our Enemies. But it pleased the Lord in mercy so to
order things, that they themselves fell into that pit they were digging for
others, as shall appear more fully in what follows.</p>
            <p>The English Plantations about <hi>Hadly</hi> being for the present set a little

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> best course to repair their tackling against another that may be
next coming, wherefore the Inhabitants concluded it the safer way to
make a kind of Barricado about their Towns, by setting up Pallizadoes
or cleft wood about eight foot long, as it were to break the force of any
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>udden assault which the <hi>Indians</hi> might make upon them; which counsel
proved very successful; for although it be an inconsiderable defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
a Warlike Enemy, that hath strength enough, and confidence to
Lesiege a place, yet it is sufficient to prevent any sudden assault of such
a timerous and barbarous Enemy as these were, for although they did
afterwards in the Spring break through those Pallizadoes at <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Hampton,</hi>
yet as soon as ever they began to be repulsed, they saw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
like Wolves in a Pound, that they could not fly away at their plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
so as they never adventured to break through afterward upon any
of the Towns so secured.</p>
            <p>As for those of <hi>Springfield,</hi> they were now and then Alarmed with a

these pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts was well weighed, so extream that it might hazard the loss
of a thousand men in one night, if they were forced to lodge abroad in
the open field; as also the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fficulty, if not impossibility of sending any

            <p>On the other hand it was considered, that if the enemy were let alone

themselves our enemyes, who if they were let alone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the winter was

could on a su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:000231_0060_0FA9AC0ED9EE0BD8"/>
It was therefore finally agreed upon by the general consent of all, to
to fall upon the winter quarters of our enemyes, by a more considerable
Army (if I may so call it) gathered out of all the three Colonyes, and
that with all expedition, at farthest not to exceed the tenth of <hi>December</hi>
before they should have a thousand men in arms ready for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe.</p>
            <p>As for the late League made or rather renewed with the <hi>Narhagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets,</hi>
it was sufficiently evident &amp; known, that they had all along from the
first day when it was confirmed broken every article of it, specially in
not delivering up the enemyes which had sheltered themselves with
them all this while, which though they did not positively deny, yet did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but find excuses, to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er it one week after another, till at the last
they would be excused till the next Spring, upon pretence that they
could not before that time get them together. Beside the favouring
of those that fled to them, and supplying the whole Body of the enemy
with victuals, upon all occasions. It was likewise strongly suspected
that in all the late proceedings of the enemy, many of their young men
were known to be actually in arms against us, many of whom were
found ei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>her wounded amongst them in their wigwams, or else were
occasionally seen returning back, after exploits abroad, to be healed
of their wounds at home. Also some of our mens guns that were lost
at <hi>Dearfield</hi> were found in the Fort when it was fired. Therefore all
scruples as to the justness and necessity of the war being removed, the
only question was, whether it were feasible and expedient in the winter.
The exigent was very great, and the choyce very hard: But as David
when he was streightened with many difficultyes at once, cho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e rather
to fall into the hands of God whose mercyes were great, though he
might be provoked to cause his jealousie to smoak against those of his
own heritage for a time: so in this exigent it was generally conceived
to be most expedient for the Country, to cast themselves upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
of a mercifull and gracious God, rather then by delayes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
themselves to the treachery and cruelty of a perfidious enemy.</p>
            <p>A War therefore speedily to be carryed on in the very depth of win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

of such an affair so circumstanced did require, though possibly not with
so much necessary care, and so suitable provision, as had been desired,
if what came afterward to pass could have been foreseen (which perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture
might be the reason things went on so heavily for want of
well oyling the wheels) in the mean time a small Army of a thousand
fighting men, well appointed, were ordered by the Commissioners to
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:000231_0061_0FA9AC0FA47AE9B8"/>
be gathered by proportion out of all the Colonyes; of which number
the share of the <hi>Massachusets</hi> was to be five hundred and twenty seven,
the rest were to be supplyed out of <hi>Plimouth</hi> and <hi>Connecticut</hi> Colonyes,
All other supplyes were taken care for, as well as the suddenness of the
Expedition, and difficulty of the season would allow. The said thousand
men, beside some Voluntiers of Indian Friends, were by the time and
place appointed as near as could be had, called together, and a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
granted to the honourable <hi>Iosiah Winslow</hi> Esq, the present

a loss to have found the enemy, until it had been too late to have fought
them.</p>
            <p>Two dayes after, <hi>Decemb.</hi> 14. Five Files of men sent out under Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeant
<hi>Bennet</hi> and another, upon the Scout, kill'd one man and one wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
and brought in four more by one of the clock: the whole Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
marched after into some of the Sachems Country, where they burnt
an hundred and fifty Wigwams, killed seven of the enemy, and brought
in eight Prisoners when they returned at night.</p>
            <p>The next day an Indian called <hi>Stone-wall-Iohn</hi> pretended to come from
the Sachems, intimating their wiilingness to have peace with the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,

in an enemyes Country. For preventing the like mischief upon

some of the Companyes being lodged three miles there from.

the place, fired twenty or thirty gunns at <hi>Mosely</hi> in particular, a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander
well known amongst them, but the rest of the Company running
down upon them, killed one of them, and scattered the rest.</p>
            <p>The next day Capt. <hi>Prentice</hi> with his Troop, being sent to <hi>Petequam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scot,</hi>
returned with the sad news of burning <hi>Ierry Bulls</hi> Garison house,
and killing ten English men and five women and children, but two esca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
in all. This is the chance of warr which they who under take, must
prepare to undergoe.</p>
            <p>The next day brought from the same place a little better news, though
not enough to ballance the sorrow of the former, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Connecticut</hi>
Forces were come thither with three hundred English, and an hundred

the <hi>Narhagansets</hi> their mortal enemyes; and by the way meeting
a Party of the enemy, they slew five or six of them and took as many
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:000231_0063_0FA9AC11DE3863A0"/>
Prisoners. The whole number of all our Forces being now come, the
want of provision with the sharpness of the cold, minded them of expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
wherefore the very next day, the whole Body of the <hi>Massachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set</hi>
and <hi>Plimouth</hi> Forces marched away to <hi>Pettyqua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>scot</hi> intending to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
the enemy upon the first opportunity that next offered it self: To
the which resolution those of <hi>Connecticut</hi> presently consented, as soon as
they met together, which was about five a clock in the afternoon: <hi>Bulls</hi>
house intended for their general Rendezvouze, being unhappily burnt
down two or three days before, there was no shelter left either for Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
or private Souldier, so as they were necessicated to march on toward
the enemy through the snow, in a cold stormy evening, finding no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
defence all that night, save the open air, nor other covering then a
cold and moist fleece of snow. Through all these difficultyes they mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
from the break of the next day, <hi>December</hi> 19. till one of the clock
in the afternoon, without either fire to warm them, or respite to take
any food, save what they could chew in their march. Thus having wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
fourteen or fifteen mile through the Country of the old Queen, or
<hi>Sunke Squaw</hi> of <hi>Narhaganset:</hi> they came at one a clock upon the edge
of the Swamp where their guide assured them they should find Indians
enough before night.</p>
            <p>Our Forces chopping thus upon the seat of the enemy, upon the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
they had no time either to draw up in any order or form of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
nor yet opportunity to consult where or how to assault. As they
marched Capt. <hi>Mosely</hi> and Capt. <hi>Davenport</hi> led the Van, Major <hi>Apple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
and Capt. <hi>Oliver</hi> brought up the Reer of the <hi>Massachuset</hi> Forces;
General <hi>Winslow</hi> with the <hi>Plimouth</hi> Forces marched in the Centre; those
of <hi>Connecticut</hi> came up in the Reer of the whole Body: But the Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers
discerning Indians in the edge of the Swamp, fired immediately upon
them, who answering our men in the same Language, retired presently
into the Swampe, our men followed them in amayn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, without staying for
the word of Command, as if every one were ambitious who should goe
first, never making any stand till they came to the sides of the Fort, into
which the Indians that first fired upon them betook themselves.</p>
            <p>It seems that there was but one entrance into the Fort, though the
enemy found many wayes to come out, but neither the English nor
their Guide well knew on which side the entrance lay; nor was it easie to
have made another; wherefore the good providence of Almighty God is
the more to be acknowledged, who as he led <hi>Israel</hi> sometime by the Pillar
of fire, and the Cloud of his presence a right way through the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
so did he now direct our Forces upon that side of the Fort, where
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:000231_0064_0FA9AC12892EDC50"/>
they might only enter though not without utmost danger, and hayard.
The Fort was raised upon a kind of Island of five or six acres of rising
land in the midst of a Swamp; the sides of it were made of palizadoes set
upright the which was compassed about with an bedge of almost a rod
thickness, through which there was no passing, unless they could have
fired a way through, which then they had no time to doe. The place
where the Indians used ordinarily to enter themselves, was over a long
tree over a place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of water, where but one man could enter at a time, &amp;
which was so way-laid that they would have been cut off that had ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
there: But at one corner there was a Gap made up only with a
long tree, about four or five foot from the ground, over which men
might easily pass: But they had placed a kind of a Block house right over
against the said tree, from whence they sorely galled our men that first
entred, some being shot dead upon the tree, as Capt. <hi>Iohnson,</hi> and some
as soon as they entred, as was Capt. <hi>Davenport,</hi> so as they that first en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
were forced presently to retire, and fall upon their bellyes till the
fury of the enemyes shot was pretty well spent, which, some Companyes
that did not discern the da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ger, not observing, lost sundry of their men,
but at the last two Companyes being brought up besides the four that
first marched up, they animated one another to make another assault, one
of the Commanders crying out, <hi>They run, they run,</hi> which did so en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
the Souldiers that they presently entred amain. After a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable
number were well entred, they presently beat the enemy out
of a Flanker on the left hand, which did a little shelter our men from
the enemyes shot, till more Company came up, and so by degrees made
up higher, first into the middle, and then into the upper end of the Fort,
till at the last they made the enemy all retire from their Sconces, and
fortified places, leaving multitudes of their dead Bodyes upon the place.
<hi>Connecticut</hi> Souldiers marching up in the Reer, being not aware of the
dangerous passage over the tree, in Command of the enemyes Block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>house,
were a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The brunt of the Battle, or danger that day lay most upon the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders,
whose part it was to lead on their several Companies in the

of the <hi>Massachusets,</hi> besides Lieute<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of those that belonged to
<hi>Connecticut</hi> Colony. It is usually seen that the valour of the Souldiers
is much wrapped up in the lives of their Commanders, yet was it found
here, that the Souldiers were rather enraged then discouraged by the
loss of their Commanders, which made them redouble their Courage,
and not give back after they were entred the second time, till they had
driven out their Enemies: So as after much blood and many wounds
dealt on both sides; the English seeing their advantage, began to fire
the Wigwams, where was supposed to be many of the Enemies Women
and Children destroyed, by the firing of at least five or six hundred of
those smoaky Cells.</p>
            <p>It is reported by them that first entred the <hi>Indians Fort,</hi> that our
Souldiers came upon them when they were ready to dress their Dinner,
but our sudden; and une<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pected assault put them besides that work,
making their Cookrooms too hot for them at that time, when they and
their Mitchin fryed together: and probably some of them eat their
Suppers in a colder place that night: most of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ir Provision as well as
their Hutts being then consumed with fire, and those that were left alive
forced to hide themselves in a Cedar Swamp, not far off, where they had
nothing to defend them from the cold but Boughs of Spruce and Pine
Trees: for after two or three hours fight, the English became Masters
of the place, but not judging it tenable, after they had burned all they
could set fire upon, they were forced to retreat, after the Day-light was
almost quite spent, and were necessitated to retire to their quarters, full
fifteen or sixteen miles off, some say more, whither with their Dead and
Wounded men they were to march, a difficulty scarce to be believed, as
not to be paralleld almost in any former age.</p>
            <p>It is hard to say who acquitted themselves best in that dayes service,
either the Souldiers for their manlike valour in fighting, or the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders
for their wisdome and courage leading on in very face of death;
There might one have seen the whole Body of that little Regimental Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
as busie as Bees in a Hive, some bravely fighting with the Enemy, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
haling off, and carrying away the Dead and Wounded Men (which
I rather note) that none may want the due testimony of their valour
and faithfulness, though all ought to say, <hi>not unto us, but unto thy Name,
O Lord,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>For though there might not be above three or four hundred at any
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:000231_0066_0FA9AC1459F30D18"/>
time within the Fort at once, yet the rest in their turns came up to do
what the exigence of the service required in bringing off the Dead and
Wounded men: The Major of the Regiment, together with Captain
<hi>Mosely,</hi> was very serviceable, for by that means the Fort being clear of
the Dead bodies, it struck a greater terrour into the Enemy, to see but
eight or ten dead bodies of the English left, then to meet with so many
hundreds of their own slain and wounded Carkasses. The number of
the slain was not then known on the Enemies side, because our Men
were forced to leave them on the ground: but our victory was found
afterwards to be much more considerable then at the first was apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded;
for although our loss was very great, not only because of the
desperateness of the attempt it self) in such a season of the year, and at
such a distance from our quarters, whereby many of our wounded men
perished, which might otherwise have been preserved, if they had not
been forced to march so many miles in a cold snowy night, before they
could be dressed) yet the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nemy lost so many of their principal fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
men, their Provision also was by the burning of their Wigwams, so
much of it spoiled, at the taking of their Fort, and by surprizing so
much of their Corn about that time also; that it was the occasion of
their total ruine afterwards: they being at that time driven away from
their habitations, and put by from Planting for that next year, as well as
deprived of what they had in store for the present winter. What num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
of the Enemy were slain is uncertain, it was confessed by one <hi>Potock</hi>
a great Councellor amongst them, afterwards taken at <hi>Road-Island,</hi>
and put to Death at <hi>Boston,</hi> that the Indians lost seven hundred fighting
men that day, besides three hundred that dyed of their Wounds the most
of them: the number of old men, women and children, that perished
either by fire, or that were starved with hunger and cold, none of them
could tell. There was above eighty of the English slain, and a hundred
and fifty wounded, that recovered afterwards.</p>
            <p>There were several circumstances in this Victory very remarkable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The meeting with one <hi>Peter</hi> a fugitive Indian, that upon
some discontent, flying from the <hi>Narrhagansets,</hi> offered himself to the
service of the English, and did faithfully perform what he promised, <hi>viz.</hi>
to lead them to the Swamp where the Indians had seated themselves
within a Fort raised upon an Island of firm Earth, in the midst of a
Swamp, whither none of the English could have Piloted them, without
his assistance, the place being near eighteen miles from the place where
they were quartered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There being by a special providence directed just to a place
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:000231_0067_0FA9AC184378BF88"/>
where they found so easie entrance, which if they had missed <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they could
never have made a way through the Hedge, with which they had sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
the Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lizadoes of the Fort in half a dayes time.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If they had entred by the way left by the Indians for
passage, they might have been cut off, before they could have come near
their Fortification.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lastly,</hi> In directing their motion, to begin the Assault just at the day
they did, for if they had deferred but a day longer, there fell such a storm
of Snow the next day, that they could not have passed through it, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
weeks after: A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d then on the sudden there fell such a Thaw, that
melted away both Ice and Snow, so that if they had deferred till that

            <p>The rest of the winter was spent in fruitless Treaties about a peace,
both sides being well wearied with the late desperate Fight, were willing
to refresh themselves the remaining part of the winter, with the short
slumber of a pretended peace, at least with a talk or Dream thereof:
our Commanders aim therein was Christian and good, if it had proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>sc.</hi> to have prevented the shedding of more bloud: And possibly
some of the elder and wiser of the enemy, did really desire what was
pretended by them all, (for they had now full proof of the valour and
resolution of the <hi>English,</hi> which some of them upon former successes
might be ready to question) and they could not but see their destruction
already begun, in the loss of their dwellings, and all their provision, as
well as the slaughter of the best part of their fighting men; but either
through consciousness of their barbarous treachery, and falshood they
could not trust others, and so were willing to run the utmost hazard, as
people hardned to their own destruction. The particular passages of
the treaty being carried on by the enemy only in pretence, and by our
men (that soon discerned their fraud) rather out of nece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="3 letters">

them from making use of their own provision, or spoiling the English

three hundred of their best fighting men, and so did two Prisoners of
theirs taken <hi>Ianuary</hi> the <hi>4th,</hi> whereof one being of <hi>Philips</hi> Company

to make way for a treaty of Peace; who laid the blame upon <hi>Canonchet,</hi>
that came down to <hi>Boston,</hi> in <hi>October</hi> last, to confirm the peace with the
Commissioners of the united Colonyes, as if he had misinformed them;
<hi>viz.</hi> that they were not by the former treaty to have delivered up the
<hi>Mompanoogs,</hi> or <hi>Philips Indians,</hi> untill the said <hi>Canonchets</hi> Brother
one of the Hostages at <hi>Hartford,</hi> was released. This was but a meer
pretence, for he and they too better understood the particulars of the
agreement: For by chance the Articles which they had of the peace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
with them were found open (whether purposely or accidentally
was not known) in a Wigwam in the Fort when it was taken, so as they

space of a month longer, wherein to issue the treaty, which so provoked
the Commander of our Forces, that they resolved to have no more
Treatyes with the enemy; but prepare to assault them, with Gods assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance

fifty head of Neat Cattle, and fifteen horses; all which they drove along
with them, and were gone too far to be rescued before our Forces set
out. Two that belonged to the said <hi>Carpenter</hi> were wounded, and one
of the enemies slain. As they marched after the enemy, they found a
good house burned, with a barn belonging to it. They perceived also
that the enemy dealt much in Horse-flesh, meeting with no less then
sixty horses heads, in one place which they had left behind them. Our
Souldiers in their pursuit came upon their Reer, killed and took about
seventy of them, yet never could come to charge them, for they would
presently betake themselves into Swamps, and not two of them run to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,

first, died soon after among the Indians.</p>
            <p>And such was the goodness of God to those poor Captive Women,
and Children, that they found so much favour in the sight of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
that they offered no wrong to any of their persons, save what they
could not help, being in many wants themselves. Neither did they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
any uncivil Carriage to any of the Females, nor ever attempted the
chastity of any of them, either being restrained of God, as was <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melek</hi>
of old, or by some other accidental cause, withheld them from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any wrong in that kind.</p>
            <p>Upon the report of this Disaster Capt. <hi>Wadsworth</hi> then at <hi>Malbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough</hi>
with about forty resolute men, adventuring the rescuing of the
Town that was remaining: and having recovered a Bridge they gat o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
safe, though the Planks were pulled off by the Enemy, and being led
up in a way, not discovered by them, they forced the Indians for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to quit the place, after they had burnt and destroyed the better half
of it. Yet afterwards it not being judged tenable, it was abandoned
to the pleasure of the insulting Foe.</p>
            <p>Ten dayes after they were so flushed with this success, that two or
three hundred of them came wheeling down to <hi>Medfield</hi> a Town twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
miles from <hi>Boston,</hi> westward from <hi>Dedham,</hi> which they surprized ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
early in the morning (and though there were one hundred and sixty
Souldiers in it or more, besides the Inhabitants) they burnt near one
half of the Town, killing about twenty persons, but by the resistance of
the Souldiers, as soon as ever they could be gotten together (it being at
or before break of day, none in the least s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Western Towns above Connecticut, were the chief Seat of the

Tragedies: for as was said before, the <hi>Narrbagansets</hi> having been dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
out of the Country, fled through <hi>Nipnet Plantations,</hi> towards <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Hills</hi> meeting with all the Indians that had harboured all Winter
in those Woods about <hi>Nashaway,</hi> they all combined together against the
English, yet divided their numbers, and one half of them were obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to bend their course toward <hi>Plimouth,</hi> taking <hi>Medfield</hi> in their
way, which they endeavoured to burn and spoile, <hi>Feb,</hi> 21. 1675. as their
fellows had done <hi>Lancaster</hi> ten dayes before.</p>
            <p>The surprizal of this <hi>Medfield</hi> in regard of some remarkable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
it was attended with, is not unworthy a more particular Relating
the manner thereof: the loss of <hi>Lancaster</hi> had sufficiently awakened and
alarmed the neighbouring Villages, all to stand upon their guard; and
some had obtained Garison Souldiers for their greater security, as was
the case with the Town of <hi>Medfield,</hi> within twenty two miles of <hi>Boston.</hi>
And at that time were lodged therein several Garison Souldiers, besides
the Inhabitants; yet being billated up &amp; down in all quarters of the town
could not be gathered together till a great part of the Town was set on
fire, and many of the Inhabitants slain, which how it could be effected is
strange to believe: But most of those inland Plantations being over run
with young wood (the Inhabitants being every where apt to engross
more Land into their hands then they were able to subdue) as if they
were seated in the mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>st of a heap of Bushes: their Enemies took the
advantage thereof, and secretly over night, conveyed themselves round
about the Town, some getting under the sides of their B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rns and sences
of their Orchards, as is supposed, where they lay hid under that covert,
till break of day, when they suddenly set upon sundry Houses, shoo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ing
them that came first out of their doors, and then fired their Houses,
especially those houses where the Inhabitants were repaired to Garisons,
were fit for the purpose: some were killed as they attempted to fly to
their Neigbo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rs for shelter: some were only wounded, and some taken
alive and carried Captive: in some Houses the Husband running away
with one childe, the wife with another, of whome the one was killed,
the other escaped: they began at the East end of the Town where they
fired the House of one <hi>Samuel Morse,</hi> that seems to have been a signal
to the rest to fall on in other parts: most of the Houses in the West or
Southwest end of the Town were soon burnt down: and generally when
they burnt any out houses, the Cattle in them were burnt also. Two
Mills belonging to the Town were burnt also: a poor old man of near
an hundred years old, was burnt in one of the Houses that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:000231_0075_0FA9AC1F7979D630"/>
by fire. The Lieutenant of the Town, <hi>Adams</hi> by name, was
shot down by his own door, and his Wise mortally wounded by a Gun
fired afterwards accidentally in the House. After the burning of forty
or fifty houses and barns, the <hi>Cannibals</hi> were frighted away out of the
Town over a Bridge that lies upon <hi>Charls-River,</hi> by the shooting off a
piece of Ordnance 2 or 3 times: when they had passed over the Bridge
they fired one end thereof, to hinder our men from pursuing them, they
were thought to be above five hundred: There were slain and mortal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
wounded seventeen or eighteen persons, besides others dangerously
hurt. The loss sustained by the Inhabitants amounted to above two
thousand pounds. This mercy was observed in this sad providence, that
never a Garison house was lost in this surprisal; nor any of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal
Dwellings, so as the chiefest and best of their Building escaped the
sury of the Enemy, who as they passed the Bridge left a writing behind
them, expressing something to this purpose, that we had provoked them
to wrath, and that they would fight with us this twenty years (but they
fell short of their expectation by nineteen) adding also, that they had
nothing to loose, whereas we had Houses, Barns and Corn: these were
some of the bold threats used by the barbarous crew, but their rage
shall proceed no further then the counsel of God had determined. The
week before was heard a very hideous cry of a kennel of Wolves round
the Town, which raised some of the Inhabitants, and was looked upon
by divers as an ominous presaging of this following Calamity.</p>
            <p>Another assault was feared, but as soon as the Souldiers could be g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together, they turned their backs, as if they never intended to
visit them more: whether these Indians went when they left <hi>Medfield</hi>
is not so certainly known; the Souldiers in the Town not having oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity
to pursue them over the River, by reason that the Bridge was
part of it burned: but it is most probable that they took their way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>Plimouth,</hi> and continued about that side of the Country for the
future, waiting opportunities to do what mischief they could to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish
in those parts: For within a month after this assault of <hi>Medfield,</hi>
there was near six hundred of them seen about <hi>Patuxit</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi>
where Capt. <hi>Pierce</hi> with about fifty of his men were lost, though with
no great advantage to the Enemy, who at that time lost above double
that number: our worthy Captains in this and other exploits being
called to imitate <hi>Sampson,</hi> who was content to dye with his enemies, that
he might overthrow them thereby: it havin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

The Governour and Council of <hi>Plimouth</hi> perceiving by the report of
these outrages committed upon the Towns of the <hi>Massachusets,</hi> that
they were like to be visited this Spring by their old Neighbours, sent out
Capt. <hi>Peirce</hi> of <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

English, and twenty of their Christian Indians about <hi>Cape Cod</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
none of his worst Souldiers, as the sequel of this his last expedition
will declare.</p>
            <p>Capt. <hi>Pierce,</hi> as is said before, being sent out to pursue the Enemy,
marched towards <hi>Patuxit,</hi> where he understood the Indians were many
of them gathered together: he being a man of resolute courage, was
willing to engage them though upon never so great disadvantage: some
say the Indians by counterfeiting, drilled him into a kind of Ambush,
possibly more of them discovered themselves after he began to engage
then he was aware of: and being gotten over the River in pursuit of
them, where he discovered so great a number of them, he drew down
towards the side of the River, hoping the better by that means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
their surrounding of him, but that proved his overthrow, which
he intended as his greatest advantage: for the Indians getting over the
River, so galled him from thence, that he was not able to defend himself
thus assaulted on all sides, &amp; himself not being able to travel much a foot,
was thereby hindred from retiring to any better place in time; so as
he saw himself constrained to fight it out to the last; which he did with
most undaunted Courage, &amp; as is said, to the slaughter of an hundred &amp;
forty of his enemies, before himself and his Company were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is said also that being apprehensive of the danger he was in, by the great
numbers of the enemy, like to overpovver him vvith their multitude, he
sent a Messenger timely enough to <hi>Providence,</hi> for relief, but, as <hi>Solomon</hi>
saith, <hi>A faithful Messenger is as Snow in harvest, another is as smoak to

used this policy, perceiving the Enemy had all blacked their faces, he also

people, newly turned out of their Houses (by which they were to

wringing of their hands; and bewailing of their losses, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much also perswading <hi>Bridge-water</hi> men to turn back, because of
the danger, but they having so clear a call, had also more cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

upon a party of Indians, about thirty in all; they were within
shot one of another, but the English having no Commission to fight, till
they were assaulted, and not being impeached in their passage, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned

hurt, as was conceived) gave a shout, and so left them, when this party
of the English drew near to their Garison, they met with a company of
Carts going to fetch Corn from an house deserted near by, about a
quarter of a mile off from Mr. <hi>Bournes</hi> House, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e Souldiers gave them
notice of the Indians which they had discovered, and withal advised them
by no means to venture any more, because of the danger; but they
were resolved notwithstanding these earnest perswasions of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
to have another turn, which they soon found to be to the peril of
their own lives, six of them being presently after either killed right out,
or mortally wounded, as soon as they came to the Barn where was the
Corn; these six are said to be the first that were slain in this quarrel.
The Souldiers at the Garison hearing the Guns, made what haste they
could to the place, but being most of them in that interim, gone to look
their Horses they could not come time enough to the relief of their
friends, yet upon their approach, they who had done the mischief pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
fled away: one <hi>Iones</hi> hard pursued by two Indians was by their
coming delivered from the extent of the Enemies cruelty, but having
received his mortal wound, had only that favour thereby, to dy in the
Arms of his friends, though by the wounds received from his Enemies.</p>
            <p>The next week, fifteen of those Souldiers looking after their Horses,
fell into an Ambush of twenty of the Indians, but being prepared for
the encounter, they discharged their Guns upon each other: but ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
men received no hurt, some of them felt the winde of the bullets passing
by their faces; what damage the Enemy received is uncertain, yet some
of the English report they found some of their enemies dead bodies in
the place afterward.</p>
            <p>Thus were they not only preserved in many perils themselves, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
instrumental also; for the preservation of most of that Garison,
who with their goods by their means, with the help of a small party of
<hi>Plimouth</hi> Forces sent thither after the six were killed (as is mentioned
before) were soon after transported safely to <hi>Road-Island.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many outrages were that Summer committed upon their Neighbours
at <hi>Taunton</hi> and <hi>Namasket,</hi> yet it pleased God to protect this poor Town
of <hi>Bridge-water</hi> from any other hurt; till the beginning of <hi>April</hi> next,
when themselves with their Neighbours of <hi>Taunton</hi> and <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> were
strongly solicited to desert their Dwellings, and repair down to the
Towns by the Sea side, but God encouraged them to keep their stations
notwithstanding the extream danger then presented. It is reported
that <hi>Philip</hi> gave order that <hi>Taunton</hi> and <hi>Bridge-water</hi> should not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
till the last, which is all the favour to be expected from an enemy,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:000231_0083_0FA9AC2789005A10"/>
but these things are only in the hands of God, and not to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>April</hi> 9. being Lords day, A small party of the Enemy came down
upon the said <hi>Bridge-water,</hi> burnt an out-house and barn, broke up and
rifled several other houses in the same quarter of the Town, which are
notwithstanding yet remaining; they sent out a party of their men to
pursue them that night, and many dayes after, but could not hear of
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 7 the Lords day also (no doubt but the betterness of the day,
will increase the badness of their deed attempted thereon) they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence
of a great body of Indians dispersed that way, with intent to
have fallen upon the Town that ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>ay, but were casually prevented by

to foreslow no opportunity, wherefore on the next day (<hi>May</hi> 8.

at 8 or 9 in the morning made an assault upon the east end of the Town,
on the South side of the River: many of the Inhabitants stayed at home
that morning because of the intelligence the day before, and so were the
more ready to entertain them; some that not taking that warning ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
into the field about their occasions, were in danger of surprizal, but
by the special favour of God, escaped, and came time enough to help de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend
their own and their neighbours dwellings, being shot at, and hard
pursued a considerable way.</p>
            <p>The Indians presently began to fire the town, but it pleased God so
to spirit and encourage several of the Inhabitants, issuing out of their Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
houses; that they fell upon them with great resolution, and beat
them off; at the same instant of time, the Lord of Hosts also fighting for
them from heaven, by sending a storm of thunder and rain very season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably,
which prevented the burning of the houses which were fired: The
Souldiers also fighting under the banner of Gods special protection

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tance, being beaten off to the skirts of the Town, made a
fresh onset upon a other quarter thereof, on the north side of the River
where they had done much more mischief, but that God stirred up sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
of the people to venture out of their fortified houses, who fired upon
the enemy, and beat them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rom their dwellings, so as in the evening they
drew off to an out-house, three miles distant from the town: the next day
the Inhabitants expected another assault, but the enemy having burned
the house &amp; barn, where they kept their Rendezvouze over night, &amp; one
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:000231_0084_0FA9AC28351F9048"/>
house more not far distant, they marched all clear away for that time.</p>
            <p>Thus it pleased God so to order his dispensations, toward this small
Town, as a brand plucked out of the fire, that they did but just taste of
this bitter cup, which others drank deeper of; yet had they not such mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
as these had, mixed therewith: under God, the courage of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
was a great means of their preservation, for they fired so
stoutly upon the Enemies, that they durst not come very near any of the
Garisoned Houses, saluting them only at a distance. God was eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
seen upholding the spirits of all sorts, men and women, so as no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sternation
of minde was seen upon any of them, during the whole time
of the dispute.</p>
            <p>In this assault they lost but thirteen dwelling-houses, whereof five
only were in the Town (the rest being out-houses and deserted for the
present) with some few Barns, and some of thei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Cattle; all which
was a very inconsiderable loss, in comparison of what befell others, and
themselves might have endured, if God had not by his special favour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iuly 14, &amp;</hi> 15. Another party of Indians came down upon the
North-west side of the Town, but with no better success; for they had
no Commission from the Lord of Hosts to touch any of the persons of
the Inhabitants, their power reaching only to the slaying of their
Cattle at this time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Iuly</hi> 18, 19, 20. They sent our parties after the Enemy to pursue
them by their Track, who fell upon some of them. On the twentieth
they took sixteen, whereof two were men: on this day they had to assist
them, it seems some of the Bay Indians sent them from Captain <hi>Brattle;</hi>
some of the Captives informed, that there were but 70 or 80. in the
Company, and but ten or twelve men amongst them: but within a few
dayes, these <hi>Bridge-water-men,</hi> shall finde better success in pursuit of
their Enemies, when <hi>Philip</hi> himself shall hardly escape their hands as
shall be seen afterwards.</p>
            <p>While one party of the Enemy thus acted their part in and about
<hi>Plimouth Colony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> towards the Sea-coast, other parties of them were not

in the inland Plantations.</p>

under his conduct about sixty Carts, being in depth from front to reer

of eminent advantage, fired upon the front and mortally wounded two
of the vaunt Carriers, who dyed both the next night; and might (had
God permitted) have done eminent damage to the whole Body, it being
a full hour before the whole Body could be drawne up, which was done

house without any harm, leaving their substance to the enemy, who
made a prey of it, and spent the residue of the day in removing the corn

firing upon the other Garison: here also they took some Cattle. No
sooner was the signal given by the first volley of shot, but immediately
in several parts of the town at once, did the smoakes arise, they firing the
houses.</p>

surprised the single Garison, but God prevented. An old <hi>Indian</hi> if an
<hi>Indian</hi> passed along the street with a black sheep on his back, with a slow
pace, as one decrepit: They made several shot at him, but missed him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>Things looked with a pretty sad face about those parts at this time; yet

the Garison house, supposing it to have been deserted, were two of them

by another shot made from the Garison.</p>
            <p>The danger which these inland Towns were like to be exposed unto

               </gap>ate mischief done about those
Towns, resolved to try what work they could make with the enemy in
the night, whereupon going forth <hi>March</hi> 27. toward morning, they
discerned where the enemy lay by their fires, (near three hundred of,
them) and that within half a mile of a garison house, near the place where
they had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>one so much mischief the day before. Such was the courage
and resolution of the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>glish, though but forty in number, Towns-men
and Souldiers, that they adventured to discharge upon them as they lay
by their fires, when it was so dark that an <hi>Indian</hi> could hardly be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
from a better man, yet God so directing, they discharged several
times upon them, wounded thirty, fourteen of whom either dyed of their
wounds the same day or soon after, which had been chief agents in this
present mischief against the English. Such was the success of this skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish
that the Assailants came off without the loss of one man.</p>
            <p>After this time the enemy began to scatter about in small partyes, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
what mischief they could about the <hi>Massachusets,</hi> killing a man at
<hi>Weymouth,</hi> another at <hi>Hingham,</hi> as they lay skulking up and down in
Swamps and holes, to assault any that occasionally looked never so little
into the woods, sometimes alarming the towns about <hi>Boston</hi> by discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
gunns upon particular persons: at <hi>

near about which place in the Road to <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> they assaulted one
<hi>Woodcocks</hi> house, killed one man, and one of his sons, wounded another,
and burned his sons house.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding the little success of former attempts, <hi>Philip</hi> and his
men have one prize more to play in the <hi>Massachusets Colony,</hi> before they
goe off the stage, and then we shall soon see their power visibly decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
every where, untill their final overthrow come upon them. There
were several small Patryes of them scattered up and down all over the
Country, yet the main Body of them was still lurking up and down in
those woods that lye between <hi>Brookefield, Marlburrough</hi> and <hi>Connecticut
River.</hi> Possibly they had some hope of d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>iving all the Country before
them to the towns upon the sea-coast; for having burned the deserted
houses at <hi>Marlburrough, April,</hi> 17. the next day they set upon <hi>Sudbury</hi>
with all their might, (hoping <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is like) to doe there, as they had done at
the Towns next beyond it. They did at the first prevail so far as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
several houses, and barns, and kill several persons, ten or twelve of
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:000231_0092_0FA9AC2EF260A6F8"/>
the English, that came from <hi>Concord</hi> to assist their neighbours at <hi>Sudbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>
a town distant five miles from them, at the first hearing of the alarm;
who unawares were surprised near a Garison house, in hope of getting
some advantage upon a small Party of the enemy that presented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
in a Meadow; a great number of <hi>Indians</hi> that lay unseen in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes,
suddenly rose up, and intercepting the passage to the Garison
house, killed and took them all.</p>
            <p>But our sorrows and losses that day are not yet come to their height;
for in the after part of the same day, that resolute stout-hearted Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier,
Capt. <hi>Wadsworth</hi> (who had not long before, with not above forty
men, rescued <hi>Lancaster,</hi> when it was in danger to have been all lost at

the Enemy was gone through the Woods toward <hi>Sudbury:</hi> this unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
Company, before ever they had taken any considerable rest, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched
immediately back toward <hi>Sudbury</hi> (that lies ten miles nearer <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi>)
and being come within a mile of the Town, they espyed a party
of Indians <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

               </gap> far from them, about an hundred, not more, as they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
these they might easily deal with; who retiring back a while,
drew Capt. <hi>Wadsworth</hi> and his Company above a mile into the Woods,
when on the sudden a great body of the Enemy appeared, about five
hundred as was thought, who compassi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>g them in round, forced them
to the top of an hill, where they made very stout resistance a considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
while; but the night drawing on, and some of the Company begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
to scatter from the rest, their fellows were forced to follow them, so
as the Enemy taking the chase, pursued them on every side, as they made
too hasty a retreat, by which accident, being so much overpow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>red by
the Enemies numbers, they were most of them lost: the Captain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
with one Captain <hi>Brocklebank</hi> (a choice spirited man, much lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the Town of <hi>Rowly</hi> to which he belonged) and some others that
fell into his Company as he marched along, scarce twenty escaping in all;
so as another Captain and his fifty perished at that time, of as brave
Souldiers as any were ever imployed in the present service.</p>
            <p>Thus as in former attempts of like nature; too much courage and

               </gap>gerness in pursuit of the Enemy, hath added another fatal blow to this

            <p>The same day another party of the <hi>English</hi> coming from <hi>Brookefield,</hi>
whithey they were sent as a Convoy with Provision for the Garison,
were in danger likewise of falling into the hands of the same Indians,

against them they met, they never durst fire at them: only three
or four having unadvisedly first discharged their gunns against the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
and falling too much in the reet of their Company, were cut off and
lost. It is reported by some that afterwards escaped, how they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
was this day, it was observed by some (at that time their Prisoners,
and since released) that they seemed very pensive after they came to their
Quarters, shewing no such signs of rejoycing, as they usually were wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>
to doe in like case; whither for the loss of some of their own Company
in that dayes enterprise; (said to be an hundred and twenty) or whither
it were the Devil in whom they trusted, and to whom they made their
address the day before, by sundry Conjurations of their <hi>Powawes?</hi> or
whither it were by any dread that the Almighty sent upon their spirits,
upon their execrable Blasphemies, which tis said they used in the tortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of some of their poor Captives (bidding Jesus come and deliver
them out of their hands from death if he could) we leave as uncertain,
though some have so reported, yet sure it is that after this day, they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
prospered in any attempt they made against the English, but were
continually scattered and broken, till they were in a manner all consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med.
After this time, however they had braved it before, they seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to apprehend that it was scarce feasible for them to withstand the
power of the English, and therefore seemed more inclinable to a peace,
by several overtures made by them, if they knew how to have brought
it about. For during these encounters they were willing to admit of
some kind of treaty with the English, about the releasing of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry
of their Captives, which they took at <hi>Lancaster</hi> in <hi>February</hi> last,
and elsewhere: To that end sundry attempts were made by help of seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of the <hi>Praying Indians</hi> (as they use to be called) about the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of some of the women and children, which were at time in their
possession, &amp; by degrees something was effected that way: possibly their
own present sufferings and wants that were upon them, might induce
them thereunto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For by this time the Spring of the year came on,
their provision was all spent, and they forced to live wholly upon
ground-nuts, and upon the fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>glish creatures, both horse &amp;
neat cattle, which they daily plundered. The Ground-nuts running up
to seed in the summer, began to grow so sticky, as they were scarce eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
the flesh also of the English cattle proving unwholsome for their
Bodyes, filling them with sundry diseases. One of them having eaten
much horse-flesh, complained that he had before eaten horse, and now
horse began to eat him, meaning some deadly disease growing upon his

eating such ranke flesh, unwholsome for their Bodyes, especially without
salt, as their usual manner is. The fishing season also began now to
come in, wherein they use to take abundance of all sorts, with which
those great Rivers up the Country are abundantly stored: they use to
take thereof, and drying it in the smoak, make provision thereof for the
greatest part of the year; and if the warr continued, they could not but
see they should utterly be cut off therefrom, and that if the planting sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
also were l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

beans and squashes (besides their corn) with which they were wont to
live all the latter part of the summer. Upon all considerations, they
seemed pretty inclinable to hearken to a peace, though some were apt
to think they would never have kept it, further then would stand with
their own advantage, and that their present desire thereof was only to
gain time.</p>
            <p>A person formerly acquainted with the <hi>Indians</hi> about <hi>Lancast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

success: The former, <hi>viz.</hi> M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

providence, and doubtless was a return of prayer, and answer of faith,
with which her husband had been upheld, and supported from the day
of her Captivity; his two children also were returned back not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
more by the over-ruling hand of God (<hi>that turns the Captivity of his
people as the streames of the South;</hi> and sometimes inclining them to pitty

            <p>About this time Letters were sent down from <hi>Connectiont Colony,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming

and destroyed many of them: likewise that many of them were destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by Feavers and Fluxes, with other distempers falling amongst them,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:000231_0095_0FA9AC31C812C1D8"/>
which was some reviving to our hopes, that the foot of our enemy

            <p>Those Indians that were our professed enemies, after they had been

a place two days journey north of <hi>Quabaog,</hi> where they divided
themselves into two Companies, one of them tarried on that side the

but meeting with stout resistance, they left the enterprize; and kept on
their way toward <hi>Plimouth</hi> Colony, where they scattered themselves up

waiting in ambush; but being discerned by an Indian in the Company of
our men that gave timely notice, our souldiers had an opportuity there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to make the first shot, and thereby not only prevented a mischief to
themselves, but killed also some of the enemy, (one of whom was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served

them, and where they had been relieved all the winter (some of them

            <p>On <hi>May</hi> 3. a party of them killed a man at <hi>Haverhill,</hi> upon the edge
of <hi>Merrimack River;</hi> and passing over the said River to <hi>Bradford,</hi>

               </gap>other Family; killing one <hi>Thomas Kemball,</hi> and carrying
his wife and five Children captive, forty miles up into the woods; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
it was questioned whether this last mischief were done by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
of <hi>Philips</hi> party, but rather by some that belong<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> to the Eastward
<hi>Indians,</hi> of which there may be occasion (God willing) to speak more
afterward.</p>
            <p>For the suppressing of these insolencies, several Companies of fresh
souldiers, both horse and Foot were raised in the <hi>Massachusets,</hi> by the
Governour and Council of that Colony, and sent out to suppress the
common enemy; the Foot under the command of Capt. <hi>Sill,</hi> Capt. <hi>Cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,</hi>
Capt. <hi>Holbrook,</hi> the Horse under the Command of Capt. <hi>Brattle,</hi>
Capt. <hi>Prentice,</hi> Capt. <hi>Henchman,</hi> Commander in chief: these several
Companies modelled as aforesaid, were sent out <hi>Apr.</hi> 27. 1676. to
range the woods towards <hi>Hassanamesit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the 6. of <hi>May,</hi> they met with a considerable. party of the enemy:
they were first discovered by the <hi>Natick</hi> scouts pursuing a Bear &amp; at the
first not discerning that the <hi>Natick</hi> Indian scouts belonged to our men,
it gave some advantage to our forces; our Horsemen falling upon them
before they were well aware, killed and took of the Enemy about six<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen,
which they took notice of at the present, although it was confessed
by the enemy, that they lost twenty that encounter. It was report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that the sounding of a trumpet without order, did much hurt, but
the Commander in chief affirmeth, that it was no disadvantage to the
service in hand, it neither being heard by our own Foot, not yet by the
enemy. If any error was committed by the English Companies, it was
in that the Horse did not timely enough draw down from the top of the
hill, whereby they came to be discovered by the enemy; who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
made the more haste to escape: However it was no small loss
to the enemy, some of the slain being known to be considerable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons;
and it struck such a terror into them, that they never durst
face our men afterwards; for although after our men returned to
their Quarters at <hi>Medfield,</hi> they saw two hundred fires in the night,
yet they could never come near them again to fight any company of
them: but the season proving rainy, hindred any further pursuit
of them at that time. And soon after this the souldiers being
<pb facs="unknown:000231_0098_0FA9AC37AF8F8D68"/>
visited with sickly distempers by reason of an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>pidemical Cold at that
time prevailing through the Country, they were for the present
released for the recovery of their health, with intent to be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
together again at a more convenient time; this was done <hi>May</hi>
the tenth.</p>
            <p>During this interval of time, upon a report that a party of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
that were discovered about <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> busie in fishing in a River
thereabouts, Capt <hi>Brattle</hi> was sent up about the 23d. of <hi>May,</hi> who

without the loss but of one of our men: Had they not discovered some
of ours on the opposite shoar, it was conceived a greater spoile might
have been made amongst them.</p>

               </gap>s to plunder them
of their Cattle, and not fearing any assault from our Souldiers, grew a
little secure, while they were upon their Fishing design, insomuch that a
couple of English-lads lately taken captive by the enemy, and making
their escape, acquainted their friends at home how secure they lay in
those places, which so animated the Inhabitants of <hi>Hadly, Hatfield</hi> and
<hi>Northampton,</hi> that they being willing to be revenged for the loss of
their cattle, besides other preceding mischiefs, took up a resolution with
what strength they could raise among themselves (partly out of gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
souldiers, and partly of the Inhabitants) to make an assault upon
them, which if it had been done with a little more deliberation, waiting
for the coming of supplyes expected from <hi>Hartford,</hi> might have proved
a fatal business to all the said Indians: yet was the victory obtained more
considerable then a first was apprehended; For not having much above
an hundred and fifty fighting men in their Company, they marched si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
in the dead of the night, <hi>May</hi> 18. and came upon the said Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
a little before break of day, whom they found almost in a dead
sleep, without any Scouts abroad, or watching about their wigwams
at home; for in the evening they had made themselves merry with new
milk and rost beef, having lately driven away many of their milch cows,
as an English woman confessed, that was made to milk them.</p>
            <p>When they came near the Indians rendezvouze, they allighted off
their horses, and tyed them to some young trees at a quarter of a
miles distance, so marching up, they fired amain into their very wigwams,
killing many upon the place, and frighting others with the sudden a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm
of their Gunns, made them run into the River; where the swiftness
of the stream carrying them down a steep Fall, they perished in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb facs="unknown:000231_0100_0FA9AC39839B2820"/>
some getting into Canooes, (small boats made of the barks of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chen
trees) which proved to them a <hi>Charons</hi> boat, being sunk, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet,
by te shooting of our men, delivered them into the like danger of
the waters, giving them thereby a pasport into the other world: others
of them creeping for shelter under the banks of the great river, were
espyed by our men and killed with their swords; Capt. <hi>Holioke</hi> killing
five, young and old, with his own hands from under a bank. When the
Indians were first awakened with the thunder of their gunns, they cried
out <hi>Mohawks, Mohawks,</hi> as if their own native enemies had been upon
them: but the dawning of the light, soon notified their error, though it
could not prevent the danger.</p>
            <p>Such as came back spake sparingly of the number of the slain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> some
say there could not in reason be less then two or three hundred of them
that must necessarily perish in the midst of so many instruments of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction
managed against them with such disadvantages to themselves.
Some of their prisoners afterwards owned that they lost above three
hundred in that Gamizado, some whereof were principal men Sachems,
and some of their best fighting men that were left, which made the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory
more considerable then else it would have been; nor did they seem
ever to have recovered themselves after this defeat, but their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
immediately followed upon it. Yet such was the awfull hand of
Providence, in the chose of this victory, mixing much bitter with the
sweet, that it might well be called a costly victory to the Conquerors,
that so no flesh should glory in it self.</p>
            <p>The Indians that lay scattering on both sides of the river, after they
recovered themselves, and discovered the small number of them that
assailed them, turned head upon the English, who in their ret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eat
were a little disordered, for want of the help of the eldest Captain, that
was so enfeebled by sickness before he set out, that he was no way able
for want of bodily strength (not any way defective for want of skill or
courage) to assist or direct in making the retreat: For some of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
fell upon the Guards that kept the horses, others pursued them
in the reer, so as our men sustained pretty much damage as they
retired, missing after their return thirty eight of their men: And if
Capt. <hi>Holioke</hi> had not played the man at a more then ordinary rate,
sometimes in the Front, sometimes in the flank and reer, at all times en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
the souldiers, it might have proved a fatal business to the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailants.
The said Capt. <hi>Holiokes</hi> horse was shot down under him, and
himself ready to be assaulted by many of the Indians, just coming upon
him, but discharging his pistolls upon one or two of them, whom he
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:000231_0101_0FA9AC3A3097E160"/>
presently dispatched, and another friend coming up to his rescue, he was
saved, and so carried off the souldiers without any further loss.</p>
            <p>It is confidently reported by some that were there present at this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
that one told above an hundred Indians left dead upon the
place; and another affirmed that he told near an hundred and forty
swimming down the Falls, none of which were observed to get alive to
shore, save one.</p>
            <p>The loss that befell our men in the retreat, was occasioned principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by the bodily weakness of Capt. <hi>Turner,</hi> unable to manage his charge
any longer, yet some say they wanted powder, which forced them to
retire as fast as they could by Capt. <hi>Turners</hi> order.</p>
            <p>It is said also by one present at the fight, that seven or eight in the
reer of the English, through haste missed their way, and were never
heard of again; and without doubt fell into the Indians hands, and it is
feared some of them were tortured.</p>
            <p>About sev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n dayes after this, they were minded to try the chance of
Warr again, and see if they could not recover their loss, by returning
the like upon the English: For,</p>

twelve houses and barns without the Fortification of the town,
driving away multitudes of their Cattle, and their Sheep, spreading
themselves in the meadow near the town: which bravado so raised the
courage of their neighbours at <hi>Hadly,</hi> that twenty five resolute young
men ventured over the river, to relieve <hi>Hatfield</hi> in this distress, who
charged the enemy with such undaunted courage and resolution (<hi>Auda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
fortuna juvat</hi>) that they beat down five or six at the first shot they
made, so making way through the thickest of their enemies, that lay
ready to take aim at them behind every tree, as they passed by; yet they
escaped all their shot till they came within a little of the town they came
to relieve, where they lost five of their twenty five.</p>
            <p>The enemy being amazed at the resolution of our men, being but so
small an handfull, that they fled immediately from the town; having lost
twenty five of their men in the enterprize.</p>
            <p>The Council of the <hi>Massachusets,</hi> gathering by these proceedings of the
Indians, that their desire of peace was only to gain time, Ordered that
the forces raised before <hi>Apr.</hi> 27. and for a time released should be
hastned out again to range the woods towards <hi>Hadly,</hi> and those parts;
made an agreement with <hi>Hartford Colony</hi> to send forces from thence to

after them, now flocking in great numbers into those Woods; there

or thirty men attending on him: but his time was not yet fully
come, nor had he as yet fully accomplished all that mischief, he was
like to be suffered to do: For upon <hi>Iuly 1st.</hi> 1676. a party of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
committed an horrid and barbarous Murder upon Mr. <hi>Hezekiah
Willet</hi> in <hi>Swanzy,</hi> an hopeful young Gentleman, as any in those parts;
they used frequently to keep a Sentinel on the top of their House, from
a Watch-house built thereon, whence they could discover any Indians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they came near the house, but not hearing of the Enemy in those
parts for a considerable time, that necessary piece of circumspection was
omitted that day, whereby that deserving person was betrayed into their
cruel hands, for within a quarter of an hour after he went out of his
own doors, within sight of his House, he was shot at by three of them
at once, from every one of whom he received a mortal wound; they
after their barbarous manner took off his head: and carried it away with
them (which yet was soon after recovered) leaving the Trunk of his
body behind, as a sad monument of their inhumane cruelty: the same
Indians, not being above thirty in number, took away a <hi>Negro</hi> belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the same Family, who being faithful to his Masters, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
interest, ventured his life to make his escape, which was the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation
of many others: for the said <hi>Negro</hi> being a little acquainted
with their Language, discovered to the English after his escape, <hi>Philips</hi>

Next day at <hi>eight of the Clock</hi> in the morning: by this <hi>special Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>
the Enemy was defeated of <hi>their purpose,</hi> and never after had any
opportunity of doing any <hi>considerable damage</hi> to the English in that
part of the Country. So as after this day we may truly date the time

an old grudge against them as is thought, for justice that was done upon
one of his Sons, 1671. whose Head ever since stands upon a Pole near
the Gibbet where he was hanged up: the bringing in of this malicious

               </gap>e, was an hopeful presage, that it would not be long before <hi>Philip</hi>
himself, the grand Villain, would in like manner receive a just reward of
his Wickedness and Murders.</p>
            <p>Sagamore <hi>Iohn,</hi> that came in <hi>Iuly</hi> 27. affirmed, that he had never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
any mischief to the English at <hi>Brookefield</hi> the last year (near
which Village it seems his place was) but that <hi>Philip</hi> coming over-night
amongst them, he was forced, for fear of his own life, to joyn with them
against the English. <hi>Matoonas</hi> also when he was brought before the
Council, and asked what he had to say for himself, confessed that he had
rightly deserved Death, and could expect no other, adding withal, that
if he had followed their Counsel, he had not come to this; for he had
often seemed to favour the Praying Indians, and the Christian Religion,
but like <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> by his after practise, discovered quickly, that he
had no part nor portion in that matter.</p>
            <p>About this time several parties of English, within <hi>Plimouth</hi> Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
were willing to have a hand in so good a matter, as catching of
<hi>Philip</hi> would be, who perceiving that he was now going down the wind,
were willing to hasten his fall. Amongst others a small party, <hi>Iuly</hi> 31.
went out of <hi>Bridge-water</hi> upon discovery, and by providence were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
to fall upon a Company of Indians where <hi>Philip was,</hi> they came
up with them, and killed some of his special Friends, <hi>Philip</hi> himself was
next to his Uncle, that was shot down, and had the Souldier that had his
choice which to shoot at, known which had been the right Bird, he
might as well have taken him as his Uncle; but tis said that he had new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
cut off his Hair, that he might not be known: the party that did this
exploit were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

remarkable in this design, was that trembling fear discerned to be upon
the Indians at this time, insomuch that one of them having a Gun in his

hand well laden, yet was not able to shoot it off, but suffered an English
Souldier to come close up to his breast, and so shot him down, the other
not being able to make any resistance: nor was any of the English hurt
at this time.</p>
            <p>The like terror was seen in others at that time, for within two days
after, Capt. <hi>Church,</hi> the terror of the Indians in <hi>Plimouth</hi> Colony, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching

them by their Tracks, fell upon their Head quarters, and killed
and took about an hundred and thirty of them, but with the loss of one
English man: in this engagement God did appear in a more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

to him, as if they had a mind to speak with him; he having had so
much exper ence as well as others of their Treachery, was not willing
to adventure presently to come near them; but when they seemed to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rge very much, and made many signs to him, and at last laid down their
Guns in his sight, be began to think with himself, there might be some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in the matter more then ordinary, therefore resolved to go a little
nearer to the shore, and then he perceived they had a great minde to
speak with him, using much importunity for that end, insomuch as he
ventured to go a shore amongst them, having but one English-man, and
two Indians with him, he directed them to keep off the Canoo, while he
discoursed with the Indians ashore: as soon as ever he came amongst
them; they told him they were weary of fighting, and that they had
fought so long by <hi>Philips</hi> instigation, but they could not tell for what end,
and therefore were resolved they would fight no longer; and that which
they desired of him only was, that he would make way for them to the
Governour, that they might live quietly amongst the English, as they
had done before, and that they would deliver up their Arms, or would
go out with them, if he pleased to accept of them, and fight for him:
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:000231_0117_0FA9AC4E80F53D40"/>
to that end they desired a time to parly with him, further about that
business, at what time and place he would appoint: He told them he
would meet them two dayes after at <hi>Saconet,</hi> a place up higher upon
the said neck, about twelve a clock; accordingly he came to the said
place, and found the same Indians, with some others, and their <hi>Sunke
Squaw,</hi> or chief woman of that Indian Plantation, there ready to meet
him.</p>
            <p>After they had fallen into discourse about the beginning of the warr,
as well as the success and mischief of it, they would have put the blame
off from themselves, and laid it upon the English: But he presently
convinced them by an undeniable evidence, that they first began the
warr; For said he upon this <hi>Pocasset, Iuly,</hi> 7. 1675. you first fought with
some of <hi>Road-Island,</hi> whereof one was my own Servant, whose leg you
brake, and the same day you shot at my self and Company, before ever
we meddled with you: They were so fully convinced herewith, that
they found nothing to reply, but fell into other discourse about a peace,
which they seemed very desirous to obtain upon any equal tearms, as
was said before.</p>
            <p>There were about fifteen of the Indians present, beside their <hi>Sunke
Squaw</hi> (which is with us their Governess or Lady) in conclusion they
engaged for ever after to leave <hi>Philip,</hi> and to goe out with him; which
they did forthwith, as soon as he had obtained a peace for them with
the Governour.</p>
            <p>It is here to be minded, that these were not properly <hi>Philips Indians,</hi>
but belonged to the <hi>Sakonet Squaw,</hi> who was nearly related to <hi>Philip,</hi>
and her Subjects had hitherto fought in <hi>Philips</hi> Quarrell, till they saw
nothing but misery and mischief like to be the issue of it to themselves,
as well as their neighbours. About twenty or thirty of these <hi>Sakonet
Indians</hi> have constantly gone out with Capt. <hi>Church</hi> ever since, and not
only been faithfull and serviceable to him, but very successfull in every
enterprise they have gone about, nor hath he lost any of them in any
skirmish with the other-Indians: And it is said that this act of these
Indians broke <hi>Philips</hi> heart, as soon as ever he understood it, so as he
never joyed after, or had any success in any of his designs, but lost his
men one time after another, till himself at last fell into the hands of
these Indians under Capt. <hi>Churches</hi> Command: For at the swamp when
<hi>Philip</hi> was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ain, Capt. <hi>Church</hi> appointed an Eng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ish man and an Indian
to stand at such a place of the swampe, where it hapned that <hi>Philip</hi> was
breaking away; the morning being wet and rainy, the English mans gun
would not fire, the Indian having an old Musket with a large touch-hole,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:000231_0118_0FA9AC4F422AD328"/>
it took fire the more readily, with which <hi>Philip</hi> was dispatched, the bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let
passing directly through his heart, where <hi>Ioab</hi> thrust his darts into

            </p>
            <p>Thus did divine vengeance retalliate upon this notorious Traitor, that
had against his league and Covenant, risen up against the Government
of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> to raise up against him one of his own people, or one that

<hi>Philip,</hi> he was called the black Sachems son: It was this <hi>Tespiquin</hi> that
burnt so many houses in <hi>Plimouth</hi> lately. Capt. <hi>Church</hi> with his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
were in pursuit of him in <hi>September</hi> last, two dayes before they
could get near him, at the last on the third day, they found the track
made by the said <hi>Tespiquins</hi> party, as they went to fetch apples from
the English Orchards: This was something a blind track, therefore
they were forced to take up their quarters that night without discove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
any place of their Rendezvouze. The next morning about nine
of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

them there, they soon after came to the third track, wherein after they

                  </gap>asset</hi> neck, so full of bushes that a man could not see a rod before
him: Capt. <hi>Church</hi> ordered his men to march up together in one
ranke, because he discovered the Indians were laid in one Range by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
fires; so that by that time they all came up into an even ranke
pretty near together, within a few yards of them, as he had appointed,
they all suddenly rushed altogether in upon them, and catched hold of
them, not suffering any to escape; there being about fifty of them in all:
<hi>Tespequins</hi> wife and children were there, but himself was absent; as also
one <hi>Iacob,</hi> and a girle that belonged to that company. The Captains
leisure would not serve him to wait till they came in, (though the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
said they might come that night) whe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>efore he thought upon this
project; to leave two old <hi>Squawes</hi> upon the place, with victuals, and bid
them tell <hi>Tespiquin,</hi> that he should be his Captain over his Indians if he
were found so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>out a man, as they reported him to be; for the Indians
had said that <hi>Tespiquin</hi> could not be pierced by a bullet, for said they, he
was shot twice, but the bullets glanced by him and could not hurt him.
Thus the Captain marched away with his booty, leaving this Trap be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind

Trap had catch'd, there he found <hi>Iacob</hi> aforesaid (a notorious wretch)

               </gap>e he missed before, but not <hi>Tespiquin:</hi> But within a day or
two after, the said <hi>Tespiquin,</hi> upon the hopes of being made a Captain
under Capt. <hi>Church,</hi> came after some of the Company, and submitted
himself in the Captains absence; and was sent to <hi>Plimouth,</hi> but upon tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
(which was the condition on which his being promised a Captains
place under Capt. <hi>Church</hi> did depend) he was found penetrable by the
English gunns, for he fell down at the first shot, and thereby received
the just reward of his former wickedness.</p>
            <p>About a Fortnight after the surprising of <hi>Tespiquin,</hi> was one <hi>Totoso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

company taken, wherein were above fifty persons: but <hi>Totoson</hi> himself
escaped, and is out still in Rebellion, unless vengeance hath overtaken
him since.</p>
            <p>The next that was seized after the former, was one called <hi>Annawan;</hi>
a very subtle, politick Fellow, and one of <hi>Philips</hi> chief Counsellors; he
had about twelve men, and as many Women and Children in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
who were discovered by their shooting at the English Horses, and
other Cattle; some of whom being taken, they made known the rest.
Capt. <hi>Church</hi>

The place where this <hi>Annawan</hi> had betaken himself, was a ledge of Rocks
inaccessible, but at one place, which by a few hands, might easily have
been defended against a great number of Assailants: but Capt. <hi>Church</hi>
by direction got up to their Wigwams before they were aware: and
pleasantly told <hi>Annawan,</hi> that he came to sup with him that night;

               </gap>ettles: After Supper much discourse had with the said <hi>Annawan,</hi> they
lay down to sleep together in the Wigwam: Capt. <hi>Church</hi> laying one

might have notice, if any of them offered to stir: after midnight <hi>Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wan</hi>
rose up, and Capt. <hi>Church</hi> was presently awake, and intended to
watch after his Prisoner: he thought at the first he might have gone
forth upon some necessary occasion; but not long after, he returned
again, having fetched out of a Swamp hard by, two Horns of Powder
and a large Belt of Peag, supposed to be <hi>Philips</hi> Belt, all which he delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

he had found, that whatever he had done to any of those, whether Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans

confessed also, that he had put to death several of the English, that they
had taken alive, ten in one day: and could not deny, but that some of
them had been tortured: and now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

by the power of Conscience, after he was delivered up to Authority, he
was put to death, as he justly had deserved.</p>
            <p>It is said that <hi>Philip</hi> when he first began his Rebellion, had about three
hundred fighting men under him, besides those that belonged to his
Kins-woman, <hi>Wetamoe,</hi> drowned about <hi>Taunton,</hi> that had almost as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
under her, as himself. And one <hi>Quenopin,</hi> a <hi>Narrhaganset</hi> Sachem,
that lived near him, and joyned with him in his quarrel with the English:
But it is certain that there are scarce any that are now left that belonged
to either of them: so as although the Almighty hath made use of them
to be a scourge to his People, he hath now turned his hand against them,
to their utter destruction, and exti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>About the Moneth of <hi>October</hi> last, Mr. <hi>Stanton</hi> chanced to come from
<hi>Se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="111" facs="unknown:000231_0123_0FA9AC5505632A68"/>
hearing by a Captive at one of the next towns that there was a parcel
of the enemy not for off, presently left Mr. <hi>Stanton,</hi> and pursued after
them, whom they soon after overtook, and made them all prisoners:
amongst them was an old man, not able to goe their pace, but promising
to come after them, they spared his life: but as soon as the men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torned
at night from hunting, the old man told them what had befalne
their women and children; whereupon the next morning they presently
following after them, overtook them, and so recovered the prisoners,
and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lew one of the three that carried them away; the other two hardly
escaped; one of them is called Major <hi>Symon,</hi> being part a <hi>Peqnod</hi> and
part a <hi>Narrhagansc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> but of extraordinary strength and courage; he
perceiving the danger they were in, challenged to fight hand to hand
with any five of them with their hatches; but they unwilling to hang
their success upon the hazzard of a single Combate, came all towards
him at once, whereupon first discharging his gun amongst the whole
Company, he brake through them all by force, and so escaped their
hands, with one more that was one of his companions. This <hi>Symon</hi> hath
since been very active in killing and taking many of the enemy; some say
that he with his own hands hath taken and killed above threescore; and
either out of hatred to the enemy, or love to the English, is this last
week gone with the Souldiers to the eastward, in pursuit of our quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
against them in those parts.</p>
            <p>At another time not long before, when he was out against the enemy;
he came suddenly upon a great number of them, as they were spread
under a steep banke, from whence leaping down into the midest of them
he killed diverse, and took others: Fighting it seems is a recreation to
him, for he is seldome at home above four or five dayes together.</p>
            <p>Some say that in one of his former expeditions, being much wearied
and spent, he laid him down to sleep; but towards morning he fell into
a dream, wherein he apprehended the Indians were upon him, where
suddenly rising up he espyed the Indians coming toward him; but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently
presenting his gunns against them, he so frighted them, that they
gave him an opportunity to make an escape from a multitude of them.</p>
            <p>Since the beginning of <hi>December</hi> last, News coming down to <hi>Boston,</hi>
that mischief was done about <hi>Seaconk,</hi> and <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> by some remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of the Indians thereabout, killing their swine and horses; several of
<hi>Medfield</hi> went out after them, and pursuing them by their track, came
upon a small party, of whom they took three, one of which escaped,
while some of the company were going after the rest: They which were
taken confessed there were a parcell about threescore, that were lurking

up and down in those Woods, the said two Indians were brought into

<hi>Natick,</hi> to go out in pursuit of them, with twenty nine of his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny:
a few of the English went with them from <hi>Medfield,</hi> who being
tired with marching in the Snow soon returned. The Indians kept on
in their design, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ghted upon a considerable party of the Enemy, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
traced them, till they found where they lodged over night;
they surrounded them early in the morning, as their manner is, and
then offered them quarter, if they would yield: eight resolute fellows
refused, who were presently shot down, the rest were all seiz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, since which time, several such exploits have been done by
them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ian.</hi> 23. last, The same Company of <hi>Natick Indians</hi> took two and
twenty of the Enemy, among which were five able men, and five Arms:
they sent the Prisoners home by five of their Company, the rest went
further in the chase.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ian.</hi> 26. last, Another parcel of the Enemy were brought in, eight in
number, of whom five were men; amongst whom was the Indian called
<hi>Cornelius:</hi> who three years since was indicted for killing an English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
Cow; upon which he is said to have uttered several threatning
speeches, that he would kill English men, and their Cows too; which
was now remembred against him, when he was in particular called to
account, for having an hand in killing some of the English and Indians
also in league with us, for which he was sentenced to dy, and was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
executed on <hi>Febr.</hi> 15. last.</p>
            <p>Concerning the rest of the Indians, either in the Colony of <hi>Plimouth,
Connecticut,</hi> or the <hi>Massachusets;</hi> there is no occurrent more of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
come to light, since the end of <hi>August</hi> last, save what is last men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
before; yet is it very remarkable that although tearms of peace
were offered to all that would come in and surrender themselves (as
appears by a Declaration put out <hi>Iuly</hi> last) and that a <hi>Nipnet</hi> Sachem
called <hi>Iohn,</hi> did thereupon with a considerable number of his Company
come in, and offer themselves, and were accordingly secured of their
lives, and other concernments; yet did that treacherous Varlot make
an escape away, this winter from Capt. <hi>Prentices</hi> House (under whose
charge he was put, about <hi>Cambridge</hi> Village) and with above twenty
more fled away into the Woods, to shift for himself, amongst the rest of
his bloody Companions; they were presently pursued, but had gone
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:000231_0125_0FA9AC5602710FA0"/>
tho fast and too far to be overtaken: whither it were consciousness of
their own guilt, that having had an hand in the bloud of the English,
they feared vengeance hung over their heads: or whither they liked
not the English manners so well, as to be confined thereunto: wild
creatures ordinarily love the liberty of the woods, better than the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
of a cage. They made none acquainted with their designe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they went away; and as yet little account can be given of them: on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
it is known that one or two of their number have since been killed;

               </gap>nd that one or two of their Families are entertained by <hi>Uncas;</hi> but
what is become of the rest is yet uncertain: There were but seven of
the Company men; so as they are not capable to do much mischief.
Some of late have travailed through the woods of <hi>Connecticut,</hi>
but met with no Indians, nor did they hear of any in their passing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

            <p>There was a great drought the last Summer, but as it seems, it was
more extream in those parts then with us about the <hi>Massachusets;</hi> and
although probably, the English might have prayed for rain themselves

<pb n="114" facs="unknown:000231_0126_0FA9AC56D39CC080"/>
desiring me that I would seek to God for rain: I appointed a Fast day
for that purpose. The day being come, it proved a cleer day without
any clouds, untill nigh sun setting, when we came from the Meeting,
and then some Clouds arose; the next day remained cloudy, then <hi>Vncas</hi>
with many Indians came to my house, <hi>Vncas</hi> lamented there was such
want of Rain; I asked whether if God should send us rain, he would
not attribute it to their <hi>Powawes:</hi> He answered no, for they had done
their uttermost and all in vain: I replyed, if you will declare it before
all these Indians, you shall see what God will doe for us; For although
this year he hath shewn his anger against the English, and not only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Indians, yet he hath begun to save us, and I have found by
experience twice in the like case, when we sought him by Fasting and
Prayer, he hath given us Rain, and never denyed us. Then <hi>Vncas</hi>
made a great speech to the Indians (which were many) confessing that
if God should then send rain it could not be ascribed to their powaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but must be acknowledged to be an answer of our prayers. This
day the clouds spread more and more, and the next day there was such
plenty of rain, that our River rose more then two foot in height.</p>

            <p>By all that is recorded in the <hi>Narrative</hi> foregoing there are none into
whose hands it shall come, but will be sensible that the present time hath
been a day of great rebuke &amp; trouble to the poor people so journing in
this wilderness, upon whom sundry calamities have broke in at once this
last as well as in the former years: in many places they have been visited
with sickness, and mortality more then in many years before, depriving
them of many worthy and usefull persons; amongst others the loss of
Mr. <hi>Iohn Winthrope</hi> the late worthy Governour of the Colony of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut,</hi>
is as it ought, much lamented by all, who dyed at <hi>Boston, April</hi>
5. 1676. in the 73. year of his age, whither he was occasionally called
the last winter to sit with the rest of the Commissioners, of the united
Colonyes, to consult about the great affairs of them, now newly enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in these troubles from the Heathen. He was the eldest son of the

long ago yet lives still in the minds of the surviving Generation, and is
like to continue much longer, by the remembrance of the eminent vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues
found in this the eldest of his off-spring, who being not long after,
or about that time called to take up his residence in that Colony, was by
the importunity of the people there, prevailed with to accept of the
Governours place, which for a long time after, he held over that Colony

though annually chosen thereunto; being so well furnished with many
excellent endowments, as well moral as political and philosophical, which
rendred him most fit to be an healer of that people. Though we are

without paying the homage due to the memory of so honourable
a Gentleman.</p>
            <p>After all the forementioned Calamityes and troubles, it pleased God
to alarme the town of <hi>Boston,</hi> and in them the whole Country, by a sad
Fire, accidentally kindled by the carelesness of an Apprentice, that sate
up too late overnight, as was conceived; which began an hour before
day, continuing three or four, in which time it burned down to the
ground forty six dwelling houses, besides other Buildings, together with
a Meeting house of considerable bigness: some mercy was observed
mixt with the judgment; for if a great rain had not continued all the
time (the roofs and walls of their ordinary buildings consisting of such
combustible matter) that whole end of the town had at that time been
consumed.</p>
            <p>Whereby we see that God by his providence can turn our dwellings

Which consideration may awaken all from security, and confidence in
these uncertain and unstable possessions, that have no firmer Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
that may so soon after their first erection, be eaten up by the flames
of fire, before the iron teeth of time have had leisure to devour and feed
upon them.</p>
            <closer>God grant that by the <hi>Fire</hi> of all these Iudgments, we may be purged from
our Dross, and become a more refined people, as Vessels fitted for our Masters

had formerly been trading up <hi>Connecticut River:</hi> by which practises
perceiving that they began to stink in the nosthrils of their Neighbours,

their forreign Enemies, if they could be reconciled to their Indian
Neighbours, the <hi>Narrhagansets,</hi> or other home-bred Enemies, if they
could but fortifie themselves by a League of Friendship with any of their
forreign Neighbours that were newly come to plant in these parts. To
this end they sent Messengers with gifts to the <hi>Massachusets</hi> in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

an answer: but they being sensible of their own danger, and of the
great importance a peace with the English of the <hi>Massachusets</hi> might be,
pursued the business very earnestly, sending Messengers a second time,
who offered much <hi>Wampam</hi> (Indians Money) and Beaver; with these
second Messengers the Governour and Council of the <hi>Massachusets</hi>
had much conference many dayes; and at last after the best advice they
could take amongst themselves, concluded a Peace and Friendship with
them, upon these Conditions.</p>
               <p>1. That they should deliver up to the English those persons amongst
them that were guilty of Captain <hi>Stones</hi> Death, and the rest that were
with him.</p>

               <p>The English of the <hi>Massachusets</hi> after the peace concluded with the

               <p>The Captain aforesaid coming ashore with his Company, by a mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage

                  <p>We set forward and marched about ten miles, where making an Alta
(or halt) there we held a consultation with the Indians that desired to
know what we intended; we told them that we resolved to assault <hi>Sassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous</hi>
his Fort, at which they were all stricken, and as it were amazed with
fear, as they plainly confessed; and so after long debate and pressing of
them taxing them with cowardize, some of them resolved to goe along
with us, though I suppose they had no such intent, as appeared afterward;
some of them left us to the number as I suppose of an hundred or less;
and marching on five miles further, we made another Alta, where they
told us we had near a dozen miles to <hi>Sassacous</hi> his Fort as we gathered
by their relation: Being very weary in travelling with our arms, amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition

resolve to attempt that Fort the which they had formerly described to be

we proceeded; Capt. <hi>Vnderhill</hi> to the western entrance with one division,

Mr. <hi>Thomas Stanton,</hi> and his son <hi>Robert,</hi> who have a long time lived

of that place worthy of credit, lately affirmed to the Writer hereof. It
is considerable by what degrees they have been consumed &amp; destroyed.</p>
            <p>The first week in <hi>April</hi> last, <hi>viz. 1676. Canonchet</hi> their chief Sachem,
having with this people been driven out of his own Country, by the
sword of the English the winter before; breathed stil nothing but rage and
cruelty against them, bearing himself upon his great numbers: yet as
appeared in the issue himself and they that escaped with him, were not
so much preserved from the present calamity that befell the rest in their
Fort, as reserved to another and more ignominious death. For all the
whole Body of the Indians to the westward trusting under the shadow of
that aspiring Bramble; he took a kind of care of them upon himself:
wherefore foreseeing so many hundreds could not well subsist without
Planting, he propounded it in his Councell, that all the West Plantations
upon <hi>Connecticut River,</hi> taken from the English, should this last Summer
be planted with Indian-Corn: which was indeed in it self a very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
consideration: To that end he resolved to venture himself with but
thirty men, (the rest declining it) to fetch seed-corn from <hi>Seaconk,</hi> the
next town to <hi>Mount-hope;</hi> leaving a Body of men, not fewer then fifteen
hundred to follow him, or meet him about <hi>Seaconk</hi> the week after. This

a <hi>Wampanoog,</hi> or the paring of a <hi>Wampanoogs naile,</hi> that He would burn
the <hi>English</hi> alive in their houses, to which he replyed, others were as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
for the War as himself; and that he desired to hear no more
thereof. And when he was told his <hi>Sentence</hi> was to dye, he said, he
liked it well, that he should dy before his heart was soft, or had spoken
any thing unworthy of himself. He told the English before they put
him to death, that the killing him, would not end the War; but it
was a considerable step thereunto, nor did it live much longer after his
death, at least, not in those parts; For after <hi>Sudbury fight,</hi> when the Sun

scarce worth half those mens lives, that have been lost these two last

their hopes about the same, by that <hi>Auspicious beginning</hi> they were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
to promise themselves great prosperity in having that Advantage
before others, to plant and people that part of the Country.</p>
            <p>But that fair opportunity was almost quite lost, by some <hi>Fatal,</hi> and
<hi>mischievous Accidents,</hi> happening soon after that <hi>noble Enterprize</hi>
was first set a foot, as hath been already in part, and may hereafter
more fully be declared.</p>
            <p>The first place that ever was possessed by the <hi>English,</hi> in hope of
making a <hi>Plantation</hi> in those parts was a <hi>Tract of Land,</hi> on the <hi>West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side</hi>
of the River of <hi>Kennibeck,</hi> then called <hi>Sag at a wocke,</hi> since <hi>Saga-de-hocke:</hi>
other places adjoyning were soon after seized, and improved
for Trading and fishing. The more remote, &amp; furthest <hi>Northward</hi> at this
time belonging to the <hi>English (Penobsot</hi> forty years since being surpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
by the <hi>French,</hi> and by them held to this day) is called <hi>Pemmaquid,</hi>
distant <hi>seven</hi> or <hi>eight Leagnes</hi> from <hi>Kennibeck,</hi> and is the <hi>utmost Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary</hi>
of <hi>New-England,</hi> being about <hi>forty Leagues</hi> distant from the
mouth of <hi>Pascataqua River.</hi> That <hi>Pemmaquid</hi> is a very <hi>Commodious
Haven</hi> for Ships, and hath been found very Advantagious to such as
use to come upon these <hi>Coasts</hi> to make <hi>fishing Voyages; South West,</hi> or
<hi>South East,</hi> from whence about <hi>six</hi> or <hi>seven Leagues</hi> lies an <hi>Island</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Monhiggon,</hi> of much use on the same account for fishing, it lying
<hi>three</hi> or <hi>four Leagues</hi> into the Sea from <hi>Damarils Cove,</hi> (a place of
like Advantage for the <hi>Stages</hi> of <hi>Fishermen</hi> in former times) There

<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000231_0164_0FA9AC82F9A3A550"/>
follows, after a short discourse of the first planting that side of the
Country which may serve as a kind of <hi>Prologue</hi> to the following <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This part of <hi>New-England</hi> began first to be planted about the same
time with <hi>Virginia, viz.</hi> in the year 1606. There the first <hi>Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents</hi>
granted by the King for the Limitation of <hi>Virginia,</hi> did extend
from 34 to 44 Degrees of <hi>North Latitude,</hi> and was divided into two
parts, namely the first, and the second <hi>Colony;</hi> The former was appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated
to the City of <hi>London,</hi> The other, to the Cities of <hi>Bristol, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eter,</hi>
and Town of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> each of which had <hi>Laws, P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iviledges,</hi> and
<hi>Authority</hi> for the Government, and advancing their several Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
alike, As saith, <hi>Capt. Smith</hi> in his general History of <hi>Virginia,</hi>
and <hi>New-England.</hi> This second <hi>Colony</hi> of <hi>New-England</hi> promising
but little Advantage to the <hi>Vndertakers,</hi> by reason of its <hi>Mountainous</hi>
and <hi>Rocky Scituation,</hi> found but few <hi>Adventurers</hi> forward to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the planting thereof, after the death of Sir <hi>Iohn Popham,</hi> who
was the first that ever procured men, or meant to possess it; for when
the main Pillars are removed, what can be expected but that the whole
building should fall to the ground. Yet, notwithstanding the discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements
the first <hi>Planters</hi> met withal in their first <hi>Winter seasoning,</hi> in
that <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>rocky desert</hi> (which made them all return home in the
year 1608) did Sir <hi>Francis Popham</hi> his Son, having the Ships and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision
which remained of the Company, and supplying what was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
for his purpose, send divers times to the <hi>Coasts</hi> for <hi>Trade</hi> and
<hi>Fishing,</hi> of whose loss or gain, as saith my <hi>Author,</hi> himself was best
able to give account. And some of the Ships sent by him, and the <hi>Earl</hi>
of <hi>Southhampton,</hi> with other <hi>Noble Adventurers,</hi> did bring home some
of the Natives of the place in one of the next following years, by whose
Informations, some of the first <hi>Vndertakers</hi> were encouraged once
more to try the verity of their hopes, and see if possibly they might
finde something that could enduce a fresh <hi>Resolution</hi> to prosecute so <hi>pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi>
and <hi>Honourable</hi> a work.</p>
            <p>But in the mean time before there was yet any Speech, or endeavour
to settle any other Plantation in those parts, That about <hi>Saga de hock</hi>
being thus abandoned for the present by the first <hi>Vndertakers,</hi> The
<hi>Frenchmen</hi> immediately took the opportunity to settle themselves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
our <hi>Limits,</hi> which being understood by those of <hi>Virginia,</hi> they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crectly
taking into their consideration the inconveniences that might
arise by suffering them to harbour there, Sir <hi>Samuel Argal</hi> was sent
with Commission to displace them, which he with <hi>great discretion, de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and <hi>Iudgement</hi> performed about the year 1613. The which
made way for the Plantation at <hi>Nova Scotia,</hi> granted afterward<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> by
<hi>King Iames</hi> to <hi>Sir William Alexander</hi> one of his <hi>Majesties most Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
Council of</hi> Scotland. The said <hi>Argal</hi> seized the <hi>Forts</hi> which
the <hi>Frenchmen</hi> had built at <hi>Mount Mansel,</hi> St. <hi>Croix,</hi> and <hi>Port Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,</hi>
and carried away their <hi>Ordnance,</hi> with other <hi>Provisions</hi> to the <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi>
of <hi>Virginia,</hi> to their great Benefit. The said places were held by the
<hi>English</hi> divers years after, till about the <hi>year</hi> 1635. by Commission
from the <hi>Scotch Lord</hi> a foresaid, but how his right came afterwards to
be <hi>alienated</hi> to any of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, doth not concern us with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the business in hand, further to enquire.</p>
            <p>Things remaining in this posture for the space of near <hi>seven years,</hi>
some of the first Adventurers apprehensive of better hopes of good that
might ensne by a fresh Attempt, Resolved to set the designe a foot a
<hi>second time,</hi> to which End several Ships were sent on that account in
the <hi>year</hi> 1615. but with as bad Success as the former; for in the year
before, <hi>viz. 1614. Capt. Smith</hi> desirous to promote the <hi>Colony</hi> of
<hi>New-England,</hi> as well as that of <hi>Verginia</hi> came thither with <hi>two Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels,</hi>
and returned back to <hi>England</hi> in the lesser of them, with intent to
be there again that next year, to promote the said Plantation; But after
he was gone, one <hi>Thomas Hunt</hi> master of the Shi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>p, he left behind, like a
<hi>wicked Varlot,</hi> to prevent the carrying on the Plantation, that he &amp; a few
<hi>Merchants</hi> might wholly enjoy the benefit of the <hi>Trade</hi> of the <hi>Country,</hi>
after he had made his <hi>Voyage,</hi> seized upon <hi>four &amp; twenty</hi> of the <hi>poor Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
Natives,</hi> that in confidence of his honesty, had put themselves into
his hands, then <hi>clapping them under Hatches,</hi> carryed them away to <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lego,</hi>
whither he was <hi>bound</hi> with the fish he had made upon the <hi>Coast,</hi> for
that <hi>Market:</hi> But this <hi>vile act,</hi> although it kept him for ever after
from any more imployment in those parts, yet that was the least part
of the mischief that attended his <hi>wicked practice;</hi> for upon the <hi>Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi>
of the <hi>Adventurers</hi> Ships the <hi>next yeare;</hi> Two Natives of the place
that had been some years in <hi>England,</hi> and coming back unto the said
Ships, as soon as they understood the iniuty so <hi>Treacherously done</hi> to
their <hi>Country-men,</hi> they contracted such an hatred against our whole
Nation, that although one of the said Natives dyed soon after, yet the
other called <hi>Epenow,</hi> studied how to be Revenged, which he so far found
means to Effect, that he <hi>frustrated this second Attempt</hi> of setling a
Plantation in these parts.</p>
            <p>Yet did not the Adventurers cast off all hope of carrying on their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe,
wherein Providence within a few years after so <hi>favoured them,</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:000231_0166_0FA9AC85E2B358B8"/>
that one or more of the Salvages called <hi>Tisquamtum and Samoset,</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed
away by <hi>Hunt,</hi> was brought back to <hi>New-found Land,</hi> from
whence he was soon after conveyed by the prudent endeavour of <hi>Capt.
Mason</hi> (then Governour of the Plantation begun upon <hi>New-found
Land</hi>) into the hands of some of the <hi>Adventurers</hi> by whose means
they hoped to <hi>work a peace</hi> betwixt the said Natives on that <hi>Coast</hi>
where the <hi>fire had been kindled before;</hi> for the <hi>Adventurers</hi> imployed
<hi>Capt. Thomas Darmer,</hi> a <hi>prudent</hi> and <hi>industrious Gentleman</hi> to settle
the affairs of the Plantatjon, now a third time revived again about <hi>Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibeck,</hi>
in the <hi>year</hi> 1619, or thereabouts. By his prudence and care
a lasting peace was made betwixt the Natives of the place, and the
English, who were but a little before so abhorred by them, for the
wrong formerly received, so as the Plantation began at last to <hi>prosper,</hi>
and <hi>continue in good liking,</hi> and <hi>Assurance</hi> of the <hi>Friendship</hi> of their
Neighbours, that had been lately so exasperated against them. This
<hi>Tisquanium</hi> forementioned, was not a little Instrumental, and helpful
to the Plantation begun at <hi>New-Plimouth</hi> about the following <hi>year, viz.</hi>
1620. in their weak beginnings, there being frequent mention of
his Name, as also of one <hi>Samoset,</hi> a Native of the same place, by the
like Providence brought back to <hi>Kennibeck,</hi> and from thence with <hi>Tis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quantum</hi>
came to the New-planters at <hi>Patuxet,</hi> or <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and brought
them into acquaintance with <hi>Massasoit,</hi> the great <hi>Sachem</hi> about those
parts; without whose Friendship that new Plantation would hardly
have subsisted long.</p>
            <p>This Story premised is the more to be minded in this place, because
the Friendship upon the means and occasious aforesaid, confirmed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
the <hi>Indians</hi> in these <hi>Eastern parts,</hi> &amp; the <hi>English,</hi> had continued
<hi>stedfast and Constant to this year,</hi> when it was broken by <hi>another Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous</hi>
and <hi>wicked practice,</hi> of a like nature, and parrallel to that of the

Dependance;</hi> yet it must not be denyed but that some of the <hi>Vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi>
were at vast Expences, casting their <hi>Bread upon these waters,</hi> where
none of their <hi>Friends and Relations</hi> have as yet had opportunity to find
it. The Reason of which is not hard to give, in Reference to all those
Lands and Territories that lye to the Eastward of <hi>Pascataqua River.</hi>
One man Cause hath been the multiplicity of Grants and Patents for
the dividing of the said <hi>Tract of Land,</hi> for beside the strise that hath
been occasioned by the Intricacy and indistinctness of their Liberties and
Bounds, (enough to have maintained a greater number of Lawyers, then
ever were the Inhabitants) If the Grantees had been supplyed with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes
proportionable to their writes and Controversies about their
bounds and Ju<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>isdictions, which sometimes they have been ready to
decide with their Swords, witness those fatal Names imposed on such
Accounts upon some p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aces belonging to those parts, as <hi>Bloody point,
Black and Blew point,</hi> and every considerable <hi>Parcel of Land</hi> being by
<hi>Patent</hi> granted to several particular persons, hindred the <hi>erecting of
Town-ships</hi> and <hi>Villages,</hi> which if it had been otherwise disposed of,
might have been full of <hi>Towns,</hi> and <hi>well peopled,</hi> and thereby the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants
had been able to have <hi>stood upon their Guard,</hi> and <hi>defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves</hi>
against the <hi>common Enemy,</hi> whereas now they were but like <hi>sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pae
dissolutae,</hi> or like his <hi>Arrows</hi> that being bound up in one bundle could
not be broken by an ordinary Force, but being loose, were easily <hi>snapt
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000231_0168_0FA9AC86B8FE2DF0"/>
asunder,</hi> by any single hand. Another Reason might be, the imploying of
such <hi>Agenis</hi> &amp; <hi>Instruments</hi> as either wanted <hi>Skill or Fidelity</hi> to manage
what they were <hi>betrusted with,</hi> which made many of the <hi>Adventurers</hi> long
ago complain, that (in stead of <hi>Bills of Exchange</hi> &amp; other Returns which
they expected) they received nothng but large <hi>Inventoryes</hi> of the wants
of their several Plantations, and the Servants sent over to improve
them, which were all the Returns that many of them ever received for
the large <hi>Summs of mony</hi> many disbursed for the carrying on their affairs</p>
            <p>A third Reason may be the several Changes of Government the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
have passed under, which have occasioned not only much <hi>vexation,</hi>
&amp; <hi>Expences</hi> to such as were upon the place; but much discouragement to
several others, who by the <hi>commodiousness of the Soyle,</hi> would willingly
have chosen Station in those parts, had they seen any hope of <hi>a setled Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
ever like to have been obtained; which is not hard to <hi>demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate,</hi>
by giving a little touch as we pass along, on the several <hi>changes of
Government,</hi> the places forementioned have been <hi>moulded into,</hi> &amp; the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral

Capt. Masons</hi> bounds were afterwards by Consent, (as is said) of his Agent

the English or Indians, one against another, though it were to the kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

That there was a general surmise amongst them, that they
should be required to assist the said <hi>Philip,</hi> although they would not
owne, that they were at all engaged in the Quarrel. The like Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie
did appear in all the Indians that inhabited to the <hi>Eastward of Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cataqua,</hi>
which plainly shews that there was a designe of a general
Rising of the Indians against the English, all over the Country, (possibly
as farr as <hi>Virginia,</hi> the Indians there making Insurrection the same year,)
&amp; that many if not most of them were willing it should succeed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though

About seven of the <hi>Kennibeck Indians,</hi> &amp; five of those called <hi>Ammoscog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
Indians,</hi> about <hi>Pegypscot,</hi> (a river more <hi>Southward</hi> toward <hi>Casco</hi>) made
this shew of bringing in their Arms <hi>Capt. Lake, Capt. Pattishal,</hi> with <hi>Mr.
Wiswal,</hi> in whose hands was setled a kind of <hi>military power</hi> for those <hi>parts,</hi>
were sent for to examine the said <hi>Indians</hi> further, of whom upon Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
they saw Reason to <hi>suspect some,</hi> if not all, whereupon they sent
Messengers the second time to the <hi>Ammoscogging Indians;</hi> &amp; also a Letter
to <hi>Mr. Walker,</hi> to send down <hi>their Arms</hi> and <hi>Amunition</hi> to them for
their greater Security. After Mr. <hi>Wiswal</hi> was returned home, the five
<hi>Ammoscogging Indians</hi> aforesid brought in their <hi>Guns,</hi> but with no

from doing him mischief, however the said Indian was presently <hi>bound</hi>
and put into a <hi>Cellar.</hi> Some of the <hi>English</hi> that used to Trade with
those Indians were ready to excuse the Indian, saying he was <hi>drunke,</hi> or
that he was a <hi>distracted Fellow,</hi> but Mr. <hi>Wiswall</hi> with the other two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminants,
lookt upon those as meer Excuses, and altogether groundless,
for one of them to this day affirms, that he was as <hi>Rational and sensible</hi>
as any of the rest.</p>
            <p>The ancient Indians being asked what they thought was meet to be
done in the said Case, said, he was <hi>worthy to dye</hi> for such an <hi>affront,</hi> yet
they would be glad if his life might be spared, offering to be <hi>joyntly bound</hi>
in his behalf, to pay <hi>forty Beaver Skins</hi> at the next <hi>Fall-Voyage,</hi> giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their hands in token of their <hi>Fidelity,</hi> and also leaving their Arms
in the hands of the <hi>English</hi> as a Pledge of their <hi>faithful keeping those Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles
of Peace</hi> concluded on betwixt them. If they proved themselves
honest men, they were to have their Arms delivered them again,
which was accordingly performed the last <hi>Iune,</hi> 1676. They having
in the mean time carried themselves peaceably toward the English.
The day after, <hi>viz. Iuly</hi> 19. 1675. An Indian of great note amongst
them, called <hi>Robin hood</hi> with great Applause of the rest, made a <hi>dance,</hi>
and <hi>sung a Song</hi> to declare their content in what was transacted. And
so they parted, setting the Indians at liberty, that had engaged thus for
their friend <hi>Sowen,</hi> the Indian; but yet to this day <hi>one Skin of Beaver</hi>
was never paid to the English, as was promised; The Indians all this
time were well provided for of victuals by <hi>Capt. Lake,</hi> with other
supplies of <hi>Rhum</hi> and <hi>Tobacco,</hi> even to the <hi>disgusting</hi> of some English
then present.</p>
            <p>But the Indians left as <hi>Hostages</hi> upon <hi>Sowens</hi> account, how Civilly
soever they were treated, ran all away at the last, trusting more to the
<hi>Celerity of their own feet,</hi> then to the <hi>Civility of their English Friends;</hi>
who after they were escaped, joyned with a parcel of their Fellows
soon after about twenty in all, in <hi>robbing the house</hi> of one Mr. <hi>Purchase</hi>
an antient Planter about <hi>Pegypscot River,</hi> and a known Trader with
the Indians, what ever wrong may be pretended by the said Indians, as
done them in <hi>their Trading,</hi> (of which more may be spoken afterwards)
that will no whit excuse their <hi>perfidious Treachery,</hi> and <hi>falshood</hi> in <hi>break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Covenant</hi> with the English, dissembling, and seeking all Advantages
of Cruelty against their English Neighbours, of which in the following
<hi>Winter</hi> and <hi>Summer,</hi> 1676. there will be a more full and undenyable
discovery. This was done in the beginning of <hi>September,</hi> 1675. Those
Indians that first assaulted Mr. <hi>Purchase his house,</hi> did no other mischief,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000231_0174_0FA9AC8F09DE5A18"/>
save <hi>plundering it of strong Liquor,</hi> and <hi>Amunition,</hi> also killing a
Calf or two, with a few Sheep, but no more then what they eat, and
spoyling a <hi>Feather Led</hi> by ripping it open, to turn out the Feathers, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenting
themselves with the Case, which they might more easily car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
away. They offered no incivility to the <hi>Mistress of the house,</hi> (her
husband, and her Sons, being at that time <hi>from home</hi>) yet one of her
Sons approaching near the house, and finding it possessed of those new
Inhabitants, he rode away with all speed, and yet no faster then there
was need; for an Indian followed him with a <hi>Gun under his Coat,</hi> to
have <hi>shot at him,</hi> if he could by his <hi>flattery,</hi> and <hi>dissembling,</hi> have got
him within the reach of his <hi>Piece.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is said, that at the first they used fair words, and spake of Trading,
but as they went away, told those of the house, that there were others
coming after that would deal far worse with them, which within a

Salvages,</hi> at one time: another of his <hi>grand Children</hi> was taken

became <hi>unweildy</hi> by Reason of the <hi>Barricado</hi> planted in it, and being
to pass through a <hi>small gutter,</hi> one <hi>Wheel stuck fast in the Slough,</hi> which
brought the Cart suddenly to the Left, whereby the <hi>Drivers</hi> lay all open

            <p>Much about that time, one Goodman <hi>Robinson</hi> of <hi>Exceter</hi> with his Son
were travelling toward <hi>Hampton,</hi> where, as they passed along, they
were <hi>way-laid</hi> by <hi>three Indians, viz. Iohn Samson, Cromwel,</hi> and <hi>Iohn

whither the Indians pursued him, but could <hi>not overtake</hi> him, so as he
got safe into <hi>Hampton</hi> about <hi>midnight,</hi> where he declared what <hi>befel
him</hi> by the way, and how <hi>narrowly</hi> he <hi>avoided the danger,</hi> intimating
like wise, that he feared his <hi>Father was killed,</hi> which was found too true,
by <hi>Lieut. Swet,</hi> who the next day with a <hi>dozen Souldiers,</hi> of the <hi>Town,</hi>

him,</hi> to do as much for him as they had done for <hi>Robinson,</hi> but leaving
his <hi>Oxen,</hi> he put on his horse with all speed, and so was delivered from

whom they <hi>carryed Captive,</hi> although he <hi>soon after</hi> escaped out of
their <hi>hands,</hi> by the help of another <hi>Indian</hi> called <hi>Iames.</hi> It is said there
were <hi>four Indians</hi> of that Company, and that the <hi>fourth</hi> was sent away
with <hi>Randlet,</hi> so that there were but <hi>three</hi> seen together at the <hi>killing,</hi> and

in <hi>September</hi> following 1676 when the Scouts of our forces came upon
the <hi>Indians on the sudden,</hi> and had a <hi>small brush</hi> with them; but all the

The <hi>poor Maid</hi> that had <hi>ventured her own Life</hi> so far, to save many

            <p>The next day toward night more of the <hi>Barbarous Enemies</hi> being

            </p>
            <p>The English, as many as could be spared out of the <hi>Garrison,</hi> (not

been <hi>Intercepted</hi> in their return home, by any of them <hi>lying in Ambush,</hi>
which is their usual way of <hi>doing mischief.</hi> After divers shot made on
<hi>both sides,</hi> but <hi>five</hi> of the Enemies appeared: who yet took the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
of <hi>Captain Wincals</hi> absence, (whose dwelling was not far off) to

wherein was much <hi>English Corn;</hi> above an <hi>hundred Bushels</hi> was supposed
to be in one of them. After they had done this mischief they fled
away.</p>
            <p>The next day after, the same <hi>Indians,</hi> or others of their <hi>Fellows,</hi>
came upon the other side of the River, from whence they <hi>shot over se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
times,</hi> to some that were <hi>grinding in the Mill,</hi> but after the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing
of many <hi>shot</hi> on <hi>both sides of the River,</hi> betwixt them, <hi>six of the
Enemy</hi> shewed themselves in the <hi>Twilight,</hi> uttering several <hi>Insolent</hi> and
<hi>barbarous Speeches</hi> calling our men <hi>English dogs,</hi> &amp;c. yet all this while
out of reach of their <hi>shot,</hi> and then they ran all away <hi>like dogs after they
had done barking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After this, those very Indians, as was supposed, burned <hi>five or six
houses</hi> about <hi>Oyster River,</hi> and killed <hi>two men, viz.</hi> one <hi>William Roberts</hi>
and his <hi>Son in Law.</hi> The Inhabitants of <hi>Dover,</hi> with some other <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

young men,</hi> being much provoked by these many <hi>Insolencies,</hi> and
<hi>injuries</hi> done by the Enemies, obtained liberty from the <hi>Major of the
Regiment,</hi> to try whether they could not meet with some of the Indians,
by <hi>secret Ambushes,</hi> and <hi>sculking amongst the Bushes and Trees,</hi> as the
Indians used to do with them, to which End about <hi>twenty</hi> divided them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
into <hi>several small parties:</hi> soon after as they were looking after
the Enemy, a party of ours <hi>espyed five of the Indians,</hi> some gathering
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000231_0181_0FA9AC99CFF451F0"/>
Corn in the Field while the rest of them were busied in <hi>beating of an
Oven</hi> to bake some of the fruit which they gathered also in the same Field.</p>
            <p>The English were at such a distance that they could not make <hi>any
sign</hi> to their <hi>Fellows,</hi> without being discovered by the Indians in the
Field; wherefore <hi>two of them crept</hi> as near as they could to <hi>the house,</hi>
at one end of <hi>the Field,</hi> where they <hi>suddenly rushed</hi> upon <hi>two of the
wretches,</hi> and <hi>knocked them down</hi> with the Butt end of their Muskets,
which was not done so <hi>silently,</hi> but the other <hi>three in the Field</hi> took the
<hi>Alarm,</hi> and fled away, who else might as easily have been <hi>surprized as</hi>
the other two.</p>
            <p>These Outrages thus daily committed, <hi>filled all the Plantations</hi> about
<hi>Pascataqua</hi> with <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>confusion;</hi> scarce any place, where there was
not either <hi>Reason for some to complain</hi> of <hi>the loss of their Friends,</hi> or <hi>burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of their houses;</hi> which caused most of them that lived <hi>scatteringly,</hi> at
any distance from <hi>Neighbours,</hi> either to <hi>garrison</hi> their houses, or else to
<hi>desert their own dwellings,</hi> and to <hi>repair</hi> to their next <hi>Neighbours</hi> that
were <hi>better fortified</hi> then themselves; But all the Inhabitants in those
parts in general, were Alarmed to stand upon their Guard.</p>
            <p>On the <hi>seventh</hi> of <hi>October</hi> following, being a day of <hi>publick Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,</hi>
a man was <hi>sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

about <hi>Newechewannick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>dyed of his wounds</hi> within <hi>two hours</hi> after;
About the same instant of time <hi>two young men</hi> were <hi>shot dead</hi> about a
mile from that place; These two had their Arms or Guns with them,
which were carryed away by them that <hi>killed them,</hi> together with their
<hi>upper garments;</hi> It is not said that these three last, (though killed upon
<hi>a day of Humiliation</hi>) were <hi>surprized</hi> in their <hi>repairing</hi> to, or <hi>retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>
from the place of <hi>publick worship,</hi> which would in a great
measure have abated the <hi>sorrow of their sad Funerals,</hi> if when they were
<hi>suddenly arrested by the Harbingers of Death,</hi> they had been found so
doing.</p>
            <p>Soon after this, they Assaulted another <hi>house</hi> at <hi>Oyster River,</hi> the
which, although it was garrisoned, yet meeting with a <hi>good old man,</hi>
whose Name was <hi>Beard</hi> without the Garrison, they killed him upon the
place, and in a <hi>barbarons manner cut off his head,</hi> and <hi>set it upon a Pole in
derision,</hi> not far off about the same time <hi>they burned another house and
Barne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the <hi>sixteenth</hi> of <hi>October</hi> being <hi>Saturday,</hi> about an <hi>hundred of
the Indians</hi> were gathered together, to Assault <hi>Newechewannick;</hi> They
began with one named <hi>Tozer,</hi> half a mile from the <hi>upper Garrison,</hi> at

first laid up thereon, (and possibly with one of them wounded at that
instant) leaving their <hi>Owners</hi> to <hi>fight it out</hi> with their Enemies. <hi>Lieut.
Plaisted</hi> being thus <hi>desperately Assaulted,</hi> he with his <hi>twenty men,</hi> was
forced to <hi>retreat</hi> to a place of <hi>better Advantage;</hi> but being there so <hi>hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
pursued,</hi> they were not able to <hi>abide it long;</hi> Although they <hi>killed</hi>
and <hi>mortally wounded</hi> several of the Indians, as themselves have <hi>since
confessed:</hi> but they most of them being so much <hi>overmatched,</hi> took the
opportunity of a <hi>fair Retreat,</hi> and so got safe to their Garrison, while
<hi>Lieut. Plaisted</hi> out of the <hi>height of his Courage,</hi> disdaining either to fly
from, or <hi>yield himself</hi> (for 'tis said) the Indians were loth to <hi>kill him,</hi>
but desirous rather to take him <hi>Prisoner</hi>) into the hands of such <hi>cursed
Caytiffes,</hi> did <hi>fight</hi> it cut <hi>desperately,</hi> till he was <hi>slain upon the place,</hi> his
<hi>Eldest Son</hi> and another man were slain in their too late Retreat, and his
other <hi>Son</hi> was <hi>sorely, wounded,</hi> so that he dyed within a few <hi>weeks after.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Indians were contented with this mischief for the present (and
indeed if all the <hi>English</hi> they had to deal with, had shewed the like Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution
with this <hi>Plaisted</hi> they would not have done <hi>half the mischeef,</hi>
that since hath been done by them) and <hi>slunke</hi> away into the <hi>woods</hi>
before the next day, when <hi>Captain Frost</hi> came up from <hi>Sturgeon Creck,</hi>
(a few miles below the River) with a party of his friends, and buryed
the dead: During these <hi>onsets,</hi> the Enemy also <hi>took their Advantage</hi>
to burne three houses, and two barns before they left the place.</p>
            <p>The latter End of the <hi>same Month</hi> they <hi>burned a Mill</hi> near the same
place belonging to <hi>Mr. Hutchinson</hi> a Merchant of <hi>Boston;</hi> from whence
they came down lower toward <hi>Sturgeon Creek,</hi> where they <hi>burned</hi> one
house, and <hi>killed two men,</hi> not far from <hi>Captain Frost</hi>'s dwelling, he
escaping himself very narrowly, being shot at by the Enemy, about
<hi>Ten in Number,</hi> who might easily have <hi>burned</hi> his house, and taken
all that were in it, being but three boyes besides himself, had he not
used this policy, to <hi>call out</hi> to some to march this, and the <hi>other way,</hi>
to look after the Indians, as if he had had many at hand to Command,
which under God was the means of his escape; for his house was
neither Fortified, nor well manned, yet was far from Neighbours.</p>
            <p>The <hi>next day</hi> the said Indians passed down the River on <hi>Kittary
side, killed one man,</hi> whose house they <hi>first plundered,</hi> and then set it

on <hi>fire;</hi> All this was done just over against <hi>Portsmouth,</hi> from whence

were traced till they were <hi>overtaken,</hi> but being near a <hi>Swamp,</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
escaped, for hast leaving <hi>two</hi> of their <hi>Packs behind them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after they went up the <hi>River</hi> again to <hi>Quechecho,</hi> where they
<hi>burned an house,</hi> and <hi>two or three Barns.</hi> Another Party of them got
over or beyond the other <hi>branches</hi> of <hi>Pascataqua River,</hi> toward <hi>Exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
and <hi>Lampny Eyle River,</hi> where they <hi>killed one man:</hi> sundry of

<hi>Exceter,</hi> where they <hi>killed one</hi> or <hi>two men</hi> in the <hi>woods</hi> as they were
travelling homewards, occasioning the people of those <hi>Towns</hi> to stand
continually upon <hi>their guard,</hi> which proved a great <hi>annoyance</hi> to the
Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>But to look a little back to the <hi>Plantations</hi> more <hi>Eastward</hi> from
<hi>Pascataqua River,</hi> where these outrages of the Indians first began.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Casco Bay Lieut. Ingersons</hi> Son, with another man going out a
fowling about this time, were <hi>both killed</hi> before they returned-home, his
<hi>Fathers houses</hi> being <hi>burned,</hi> with wany others also thereabouts.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Black point, Lieut. Augur</hi> with <hi>two more</hi> were assaulted by the
Indians, where after <hi>many shot</hi> exchanged betwixt them, himself was
so wounded, that he <hi>dyed soon after,</hi> and his brother also was <hi>killed</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
a <hi>few dayes afterwards,</hi> not far from the same place.</p>
            <p>When the rising of the Indians <hi>first began</hi> in those <hi>Eastern parts,</hi>
(with us called the <hi>County of Yorkshire) Captain Wincol</hi> of <hi>Neweche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wannick,</hi>
with some others, having a <hi>Sympathy</hi> for the sufferings of the

as one of the <hi>principal grounds</hi> of their <hi>present quarrel:</hi> The
thing alleadged is too ture as to matter of Fact, and the persons that did
it were lately committed to prison in order to their <hi>further tryal.</hi> Yet
all those Indians do, or may know full well that they who did them that
wrong, were lyable to <hi>due punishment,</hi> (or else their <hi>quarrel</hi> might be

            <p>Further also it is affirmed by some persons <hi>worthy of Credit,</hi> that for

need not have wanted <hi>powder</hi> or <hi>shot,</hi> only they wanted something
wherewith to <hi>cloak their malitious and barbarous practices</hi> of late com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

            <p>Before the <hi>Warre</hi> with <hi>Philip</hi> was well ended to the <hi>Southward,</hi> there

            </p>
            <p>The manner how <hi>Antony Bracket</hi> and his wife made their escape was
very <hi>remarkable,</hi> and therefore judged worthy to be inserted here al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
out of due place, the Indians that led them Captive, having
brought them to the <hi>North side of Casco Bay:</hi> News was brought to the
said Indians of the surprizal of <hi>Arowsick house in Kennib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ck,</hi> withall
the store therein, which did so rejoyce them, that they made all haste to
share in the good things there to be had. Thus eager to be gone they
promised <hi>Bracket and his wife</hi> that they should have also a share there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
if they would make haste after them, bringing along a burthen alot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to each of them: The woman having a little before observed an
<hi>old Burchin Canoo</hi> lying by the <hi>water side,</hi> hoped it was an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
Providence offered for their escape; whereupon she first prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
asked of the Indians to let the <hi>Negro</hi> their own servant (as the same
time carryed Captive by them) help them to carry their <hi>burthens,</hi>
which was <hi>granted:</hi> then she begged of them a piece or two of meat,
which was not <hi>denyed them.</hi> Thus being furnished with help and
provision, the <hi>Indians</hi> leaving them thus behinde to come after with
their <hi>several burthens</hi> and a <hi>young Child;</hi> They could not but look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it as a <hi>nutus Divinus,</hi> to bid them, shift for themselves: the woman
also found a needle and thred in the house, where they stayd on that <hi>side
of the Bay,</hi> with which having mended the <hi>Canoo,</hi> they ventured to get
away; which prosperously succeeded: for in that <hi>old Canoo</hi> they cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
a water <hi>eight or nine miles broad,</hi> and when they came on the <hi>South
side of the Bay,</hi> they might have been in as much danger of other <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>
that had lately been about <hi>Black</hi> point, and had taken it; but they
were newly gone: So things on all sides thus concurring to help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<hi>their Deliverance,</hi> they came <hi>safely</hi> to the <hi>Fat</hi> at <hi>Black</hi> point,
where also by special Providence they met with a <hi>Vessel</hi> bound for <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cataqua,</hi>
that came in to that <hi>Harbour,</hi> but a few hours before they
came thither, by which means they <hi>Arrived safe in Pascataqua</hi> River,
soon after, all which Circumstances are very worthy to be noted.</p>
            <p>Amongst those <hi>Indians</hi> that seized <hi>this Brackets Family,</hi> the chief
was one <hi>Simond,</hi> that <hi>newly</hi> or a little before had escaped out of <hi>Dover

Prison,</hi> where he was not over carefully lookt to, he had had his hand
in the <hi>murther</hi> of <hi>sundry English,</hi> as himself confessed; not missing
<hi>save one in the</hi> which he had <hi>discharged his gun</hi> upon, but because he
came in <hi>voluntarily,</hi> bringing in a <hi>woman and fire Children</hi> of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
who had been <hi>carryed Captive</hi> a little before, it was questioned,
whether his <hi>last act of submission</hi> might not <hi>ballance</hi> his former <hi>transgre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion,</hi>
and therefore was he committed to that, not so <hi>secure a Prison,</hi>
till his Case might be further considered of,. It is said that coming to
that <hi>Brackets house</hi> over night he pulled forth a <hi>counterfieted</hi> pass, under
the hands of some publick <hi>Officers,</hi> or men <hi>intrusted with that Service,</hi>
making shew of all Friendship, but in the morning or soon after, he
pulled off his <hi>Vizour</hi> of a <hi>friend,</hi> and discovered what he was, yet <hi>grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
Life to this person and his Family, that did not, or could not resist,
which he denyed to some of the <hi>Neighbours</hi> not far off, who were many
of them <hi>killed by this bloody Villany,</hi> and his Partners.</p>
            <p>There are some <hi>Circumstances</hi> in the Assault of <hi>Anthony Brackets</hi>
house very considerable, which, because it was the first <hi>Outrage</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
by the Indians in this their <hi>second Insurrection,</hi> 1676. are worthy
of a more particular remembring.</p>
            <p>This Indian forementioned called <hi>Simond,</hi> after he had escape out
of <hi>Prison</hi> at <hi>Dover,</hi> came up to <hi>Gasco,</hi> and either in the end of <hi>Iuly,</hi> or
beginning of <hi>August,</hi> acquainted himself with this <hi>Antony Bracket,</hi>
and oft frequented his house: Upon the <hi>ninth of August,</hi> some of the
Indians having <hi>killed a Cow</hi> of his, the Indian <hi>Simond</hi> coming to his
house promised to bring the Indians to him that had <hi>killed his Cow</hi> In
the mean time they of the place sent two men to <hi>Major Walderns</hi> at
<hi>Dover,</hi> to complain of this injury done by the Indians; but before their

a party of <hi>Indians</hi> came to <hi>Antony Brackets</hi> house, and told him there
were the Indians that had <hi>killed his Cow;</hi> but as soon as they had said
that, the <hi>Indians</hi> went further into his house and took hold of all the
<hi>Guns</hi> they could see, <hi>Antony Bracket</hi> asked what was the meaning of
that, <hi>Simond</hi> presently replyed, that so it <hi>must be,</hi> asking him withal,
whether he had rather serve the <hi>Indians,</hi> or be <hi>slain by them, Antony
Bracket</hi> Answered, that if the Case were so, he would rather chuse to
<hi>serve them,</hi> then be <hi>killed by them: Simond</hi> replyed, that then they must
<hi>be bound,</hi> which presently was done. The said <hi>Bracket, his wife,</hi> and a
<hi>Negro</hi> were <hi>all bound</hi> by the Indians, <hi>his wife</hi> had a <hi>Brother,</hi> who offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

running with all haste, which made him fear some mischief was in hand,

came near to <hi>his house,</hi> he called to the <hi>People</hi> to make <hi>hast away,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Garrison house,</hi> and bid the rest <hi>look to themselves,</hi> and <hi>fire</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Indians, that were coming against them: In the mean while, <hi>the
Indians</hi> passing from <hi>Anthony Brackets</hi> to <hi>Corbins,</hi> killed <hi>Corbin him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi>
with <hi>Humphry Durham,</hi> and <hi>Benjamin Atwel</hi> forementioned:
Then passing on to <hi>other houses,</hi> carryed away some of them <hi>Captive,</hi>
and <hi>killed</hi> others. At one of the next houses, the <hi>women and Children</hi>
got off into the <hi>water</hi> by a <hi>Canoo;</hi> but one <hi>Iames Ross,</hi> his <hi>wife and

<hi>their persons,</hi> as sometimes the <hi>Mohawks</hi> did with such as had been sent
to them: <hi>Captain Davis</hi> and the other <hi>Gentleman</hi> told them, therein
they <hi>dealt like men:</hi> Answer was presently made them; you did <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
by our men,</hi> when <hi>fourteen</hi> came to <hi>treat</hi> with you: And set a
<hi>Guard over them,</hi> and took away <hi>their Guns:</hi> And not only so, but a
second time you <hi>required our Guns,</hi> and demanded us to <hi>come down</hi> unto
you, or else you would kill us, which was the Cause of our <hi>leaving</hi> both
<hi>our Fort,</hi> and <hi>our Corn</hi> to our great loss.</p>
            <p>It was without doubt no small trouble to their minds, in a Treaty

the <hi>best Construction</hi> might be, on such <hi>Irregular actions,</hi> which could

were not within the Limits of their Government, and therefore though
they could not <hi>call them</hi> to an <hi>account</hi> for <hi>so acting,</hi> yet they did <hi>utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
disallow</hi> thereof: Adding farther, as soon as we understood thereof

in Friendship, so did <hi>seven or eight more</hi> of the <hi>Amonoscoggan</hi>
men; whose Names they took, of whom <hi>Mug</hi> and <hi>Robin Hoods</hi>

               </gap>o for Powder and Shot, when they had eaten up their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian
Corn, what they should do for the <hi>Winter,</hi> for their hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Voyages? asking withal, whether they would have them dy,
or leave their Country, and go all over to the <hi>French.</hi> Our Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
told him, they would do what they could with the <hi>Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi>
some might be <hi>allowed them</hi> for <hi>Necessity:</hi> He said they had
waited long already, and therefore would have them now say yea, or
nay, whether they should have <hi>powder as formerly, or not?</hi> Our Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers
then <hi>Replyed,</hi> you your selves say, many of the <hi>Western</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
would not have Peace, And therefore if we sell you <hi>powder,</hi> and
you give it to the <hi>Western</hi> men, what do we but cut our own Throats?
Adding further, It is not in our power <hi>without leave,</hi> if you should <hi>wait
ten year</hi> more, to let you have <hi>powder,</hi> at which words they seemed
much to be offended.</p>
            <p>But yet the next day they resolved to go down with them, &amp; to speak
with the Western men, thereby, if it might be, to stop their farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding.</p>
            <p>So going down with them <hi>the next day,</hi> they met with some Indians
who had got <hi>strong Liquor,</hi> with whom they fell a drinking: Our

the <hi>sixth day</hi> of the week. But the next night save one, news came

            <p>Upon the <hi>thirteenth of August,</hi> 1676. several Indians repaired in the

Evening to the house of one Mr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> an ancient Inhabitant, and

that was <hi>servant</hi> in the house, either <hi>naturally afraid</hi> of the <hi>Natives,</hi>
or else upon something <hi>she observed</hi> in their <hi>Countenance,</hi> or <hi>Carriage,</hi>
manifested so <hi>much fear,</hi> as made her <hi>run out of the house</hi> to hide her

telling her (although they could not perswade her so to believe) that
there was no Reason to be <hi>afraid</hi> of them: presently after more of the
<hi>Barbarous Villains</hi> coming into the house, she grew <hi>more afraid then
before,</hi> being now more strongly perswaded that they came on <hi>purpose</hi> to
<hi>kill or surprize</hi> those in the Family, whereupon she suddenly made <hi>an
escape</hi> out of the house, and presently passed into a <hi>Field of Indian Corn,</hi>
whereby she might the better avoid the <hi>danger of any pursuer,</hi> and so
ran cross over the land that night <hi>ten</hi> or <hi>twelve miles,</hi> to give them notice
that lived at <hi>Shipscot River,</hi> It is said that after she got out, she heard
<hi>a noyze</hi> in the house, as if they were <hi>fighting or scuffling within doors;</hi> but
she did not count it wisdom to go back to see what the <hi>matter was,</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

of them came upon <hi>Cape Nidduck,</hi> where they <hi>killed and carryed away</hi>

Outrages could be expected from any of those <hi>barbarous miscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants;</hi> and was willing to make offer of a <hi>Treaty</hi> to <hi>Mr. Iosselin,</hi> chief of
the Garrison, to whom the said <hi>Mugg</hi> promised liberty for all that
were there, to depart with their goods upon the <hi>surrender of the place:</hi>
The said <hi>Iosselin</hi> reports, that when he came back from his treating with
<hi>Mugg,</hi> that all the People were fled away out of the Garrison, having
carryed away their goods by water before his return, in so much that
having none but his <hi>Household Servants</hi> to stand by him, he was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to make no Resistance, and so <hi>surrendred.</hi>

            <p>When People have once <hi>been frighted</hi> with Reports and Sense of
danger, they are ready to <hi>fly away</hi> like a <hi>Hart</hi> before the <hi>Hunter</hi> or
his <hi>Hounds,</hi> one of the Inhabitants of the place affirmed he saw <hi>an
hundred and fifty</hi> Indians, which was more by <hi>an hundred</hi> than any body
else ever saw near the Fort. But when a place is <hi>designed to Ruine,</hi>
every thing they take in hand shall tend thay way.</p>
            <p>The loss of <hi>Black point</hi> was accompanyed with another sad Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
that <hi>fell out</hi> about the same time at <hi>Richmonds Island.</hi> For young
<hi>Mr. Fryer</hi> with some others at <hi>Pascataqua,</hi> to whom it seemed grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
that the Indians should make <hi>all that Spoyle</hi> in every place in those

with a <hi>Kotch</hi> to try what they could save of such things that the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans

not willing to leave behind; and besides the wind blowing in hard upon
them, they could not <hi>get out of the Harbour,</hi> but were forced to abide
the danger of an Assault. The Indians getting many of them into the

them was able to look <hi>above deck,</hi> but he was in danger of being <hi>shot
down,</hi> amongst the rest <hi>Mr. Iames Fryer</hi> venturing too much <hi>in view</hi>

till they were brought to the sad choice of <hi>falling into the hands</hi>
of one of these three bad Masters, the Fire, the water, or the <hi>Barbarous

afterwards, at least of lengthning out their lives a little longer, for
the Indians had <hi>manned</hi> cut a <hi>Canoo</hi> with several hands to <hi>cut their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi>
and others stood ready within the defence of the stage head to fire
upon any one that stirred in the <hi>Ketch,</hi> by which means the Vessel after
the Cable was cut soon drave a shore; and then was it threatned to be
presently burned, if they did not all yield, to which they all at last
consented.</p>

The Issue of which we as yet <hi>wait to hear</hi> in Gods good time,
this <hi>12th. of December</hi> following, 1676. when they there have made an

            <p>There are two <hi>principal Actors</hi> amongst the Indians that have all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long

them that know them, a <hi>strange kind</hi> of <hi>moralized Salvages. Grave

have <hi>received some Visions</hi> and <hi>Revelations,</hi> by which they have been

We know where <hi>that Fountain</hi> hath its Rise, that sendeth forth at the

<hi>Iustice</hi> was done upon <hi>one of them,</hi> the other, although he was led by

Another disappointment our Forces met withal about the same time,
for when <hi>Captain Hathorne</hi> was up at <hi>Casco Bay</hi> with his Souldiers, he

The rest of the Indians that were scattered about <hi>Casco Bay,</hi> having
discovered our Forces, made their escape: But, we hope their time
is short, and that God will find some way to cut off the <hi>bloody</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful

            <p>But by one such Accident or other; <hi>our Souldiers</hi> could not meet with
any of them that had done all the mischief about those parts. And while
our Forces lay about <hi>Casco Bay;</hi> A small party of the Enemy came
down upon the Borders of the Town of <hi>Wells,</hi> where they <hi>lay in Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bush</hi>

to come over and <hi>fight with them man to man:</hi> using several Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Tearms to them, making a Shot at them also, which some of the
Company not being able to bear, did <hi>very resolutely adventure</hi> through

For soon after onr Forces were returned back from <hi>Casco,</hi> news was
brought of the <hi>surprizal</hi> of <hi>Black point,</hi> on the <hi>twelfth of October,</hi> as
was mentioned before; which notwithstanding; It was judged more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viseable
to venture and proceed on with the Expedition toward <hi>Ossapy,</hi>
(whether it was supposed by this time, the greatest number of them
were retired) rather then to return back again to recover <hi>Black point,</hi>
where was nothing to be expected but an empty Fort, and some desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
houses, which it seems the Indians had forsaken by that time.</p>
            <p>And besides that other <hi>Forces</hi> were about the same time ordered to <hi>repair</hi>
thither, sufficient for the repairing &amp; securing of the place with what else

the People were not so despondent, to yield up the place upon so slight an
occasion; which when the <hi>Enemy</hi> discerned, they soon drew off, after they

whole</hi> to the <hi>Owners,</hi> unless it were <hi>the Leg</hi> of one of them, which was
also taken away.</p>
            <p>This was all the mischief was done by them, after the taking of <hi>Black
point:</hi> The Inhabitants of <hi>Winter Harbour,</hi> near adjoyning thereto,
being alarmed with the surprizal of the other place; fled away with
<hi>their goods,</hi> for a time; till they heard the Enemies were removed far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Eastward,</hi> and then it was said; they returned to their place again;
In this posture have things in those places remained ever since, in those
<hi>Eastern Plantations</hi> betwixt <hi>Pascataqua</hi> and <hi>Casco Bay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our Forces under the Command of <hi>Captain Hathorne,</hi> and <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Syl,</hi> having at the last obtained all things necessary for a <hi>Winter
march</hi> into the woods, did upon the <hi>first of November</hi> following, set
forth toward <hi>Ossapy,</hi> where, after <hi>four dayes march</hi> of very <hi>difficult
way,</hi> over many Rivers, not easy to pass at that time of the year, they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived;
but found <hi>never an Indian;</hi> either there, or in the way, as they
marched along: The Indians belonging to those parts, had not many
years before hired some <hi>English Traders</hi> to build them a <hi>Fort,</hi> for their se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
against the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> which was built <hi>very strong</hi> for that purpose
<hi>fourteen Foot</hi> high with <hi>Flankers</hi> at each corner. But at this time the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<hi>intending to disappoint them of their Refuge,</hi> made <hi>Fuel thereof,</hi> which
at that time was very <hi>needful for out People,</hi> who had marched many
miles <hi>through deep Snow</hi> in a very <hi>cold Season,</hi> when they could hardly
keep themselves from <hi>freezing</hi> as they passed along, so early in the
<hi>Winter:</hi> None of the Enemy being to be found there in their <hi>strongest
Fort;</hi> It was not counted worth the while for all the Company to
<hi>march any farther:</hi> Wherefore a small party being sent up <hi>eighteen or

along they met with many <hi>vast Lakes,</hi> (supposed to be the Cause
of the <hi>sharpness of the cold,</hi> in that side of the Country) making the place
<hi>scarce habitable</hi> for any besides those <hi>Salvages</hi> that use to <hi>hunt th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for <hi>Moose</hi> in the <hi>Winter,</hi> and <hi>Beaver</hi> in the <hi>Summer,</hi> (a sort of
Creatures, whose Skins are of more Account than all their bodies.) But
at this time it is supposed they were all gone lower toward the Sea side,
<hi>to share the Spoyls</hi> of the English Plantations, lately surprized by them;
which is all the <hi>Reward</hi> they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ave met withal, who in former years,
for the sake of a little Lucre by Traffick with them, have run themselves
there into the very <hi>Iaws of destruction,</hi> either by Irregular dealing with
them; or by their too much c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>November the ninth,</hi> our Forces having spent <hi>nine dayes</hi> in this Service,
returned safe to <hi>Newechewannick,</hi> from whence they set forth at the first,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:000231_0213_0FA9ACC09E368EE0"/>
having run more <hi>hazard of their Limbs,</hi> by the <hi>sharpness of the Frost,</hi> than
of <hi>their lives</hi> by any <hi>Assault</hi> from their Enemies.</p>
            <p>There was great probability that the designe might have had some
good Effect, if <hi>Mugg</hi> a <hi>chief Leader</hi> of them, did not much abuse
those he fled unto, with a <hi>proffer of Peace;</hi> for he told them that there
were about an hundred of them about <hi>Ossapy,</hi> not many dayes before:
But it becomes us to look beyond <hi>second Causes,</hi> in Events of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
and conclude, that <hi>God had raised up</hi> these Barbarous Enemies to
bring <hi>a like Chastisement</hi> upon the English in this <hi>side of the Country,</hi>
with that which others had endured elsewhere, in the end of the fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and beginning of this present year.</p>
            <p>Whereas mention was formerly made of a <hi>Peace concluded</hi> at <hi>Boston</hi>
betwixt the <hi>Governour and Council</hi> of the <hi>Massachusets,</hi> and <hi>Mugg</hi> an

Whereupon for fear of being <hi>shut up</hi> by the <hi>sharpness</hi> of the <hi>Winter</hi>
from returning themselves, they took the opportunity of the next <hi>fair
wind</hi> of setting Sayle for <hi>Boston,</hi> (only turning in to <hi>Pemmaquid</hi> to see
if they could hear any <hi>farther News</hi> there) where they arrived with
<hi>such Prisoners,</hi> as were freely delivered by <hi>Madockawando,</hi> the <hi>twenty
fifth of December following, Anno,</hi> 1676. Amongst which Prisoners, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
the two forementioned, who were fonnd at <hi>Penobscot,</hi> there was a
third, by a more <hi>remarkable Providence</hi> then ordinary, added unto
them, <hi>Mr. Thomas Cobbet,</hi> Son of that <hi>Reverend</hi> and <hi>worthy Minister</hi>
of the <hi>Gospel, Mr. Thomas Cobbet (Pastor</hi> of the Church at <hi>Ipswitch,</hi> a
Town within the <hi>Massachusets Iurisdiction)</hi> who had all the time of
his <hi>Sons Captivity</hi> together with his friends <hi>wrestled with God</hi> in their
<hi>daily Prayers</hi> for his <hi>Release,</hi> and accordingly he was with the more
<hi>joy received</hi> by his friends, as an <hi>Answer</hi> and <hi>Return</hi> of their <hi>Prayers.</hi>
The said young man had lived with <hi>Mr. Fryer, Merchant</hi> of <hi>Ports-mouth</hi>
for some years before, and had been oft at Sea with <hi>Mr. Iames
Fryer</hi> the eldest Son of the said <hi>Merchant,</hi> and who had after much

borne him so much Respect, that when he was urged by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to go along with <hi>Mr. Shendal,</hi> as was said before, he would not
venture unless his Friend <hi>Thomas Cobbet</hi> would go along with him; <hi>the
which Service</hi> he only for his Friends sake accepted, which proved a <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Adventure</hi> to <hi>Mr. Iames Fryer,</hi> and might have done to the other
also, had not God otherwise <hi>disposed of him,</hi> having, as is hop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Service</hi> for him in the <hi>Land of the living.</hi> Amongst all the Prisoners at
that time taken, the said <hi>Thomas Cobbet</hi> seemed to have had the <hi>hardest
portion:</hi> For besides the <hi>desperate dangers</hi> that he escaped, before he
was taken. <hi>First,</hi> by a <hi>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

a <hi>drunken Indian,</hi> who had a <hi>knife</hi> at his <hi>Throat</hi> to <hi>cut it,</hi> when his
<hi>hands</hi> were <hi>bound,</hi> when the Indians came to <hi>share the Prisoners</hi> amongst
them, he fell into the hands of one of the <hi>ruggeddest Fellows,</hi> by whom
within a few dayes after <hi>his surprizal,</hi> he was carryed first from <hi>Black
point,</hi> to <hi>Shipscot River</hi> in the <hi>Ketch,</hi> which the Indians made them to
Sayle for them, into the <hi>said River,</hi> from thence he was forced <hi>to travel</hi>
with his <hi>Pateroon Four or five miles</hi> over land to <hi>Damariscottee,</hi> where
he was compelled <hi>to row or paddle</hi> in a <hi>Canoo</hi> about <hi>fifty five miles</hi> far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

<hi>fifty</hi> or <hi>sixty mile:</hi> farther <hi>Eastward,</hi> to an <hi>Island</hi> called <hi>Mount Desart,</hi>
where his <hi>Pateroon</hi> used to keep his <hi>winter station,</hi> and to appoint his

man</hi> forced to continue <hi>nine weeks</hi> in the Service of a <hi>Salvage miscre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant,</hi>
who sometimes would <hi>Tyrannize</hi> over him, because he could not
understand <hi>his Language,</hi> and for want thereof, might occasion him to
<hi>miss of his Game,</hi> or the like. What ever sickness he was obno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

for the obtaining of which, those that come amongst them have
not been unwilling to offer them in way of <hi>Exchange,</hi> such Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
as the Indians most fancy and desire, as <hi>Powder</hi> and <hi>Amunition,</hi> not

the <hi>Hollanders</hi> used so to deal with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> at such times as they
had their <hi>fiercest Wars</hi> with them, saying, that if they did not, others
would carry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> those Commodities to their Enemies, which they thought

Wars,</hi> the gain of the <hi>Barter</hi> might help to make amends for the loss of

possible according to the <hi>Eye of Reason</hi> that so much mischief could have
been done us by our Indian Neighbours, at this time more than in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
years. Their wills were as good heretofore, but when they had
nothing but <hi>Bows and Arrows</hi> to trust unto, they were capable of no
such mischief: But now by their <hi>frequent Converse</hi> and <hi>Trading</hi> with
the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi> on each side of us, they are as well <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It is reported by an <hi>Ancient Marriner</hi> yet living in these parts, a
person of <hi>good Credit,</hi> that above <hi>twenty years since</hi> being in the <hi>Eastern
parts</hi> about <hi>Kennibeck,</hi> he heard an old Indian tell this story, that when
he was a <hi>Youth,</hi> there was a <hi>Fort</hi> built about <hi>Saga-de-Hock</hi> (the Ruines
of which were then shown <hi>this Relater,</hi> supposed to be that called
<hi>St. Georges Fort</hi> in honour of <hi>Captain George Popham,</hi> the <hi>President</hi>
of the Company sent over <hi>Anno,</hi> 1607.) And possessed for some time
by the English: But afterward upon some Quarrel that fell out betwixt
the <hi>Indians</hi> and <hi>them,</hi> the English were some of them killed by the said
<hi>Indians,</hi> and the rest all driven out of the <hi>Fort,</hi> where there was left
much of their <hi>Provision</hi> and <hi>Amunition;</hi> amongst which there was some
<hi>Barrels of Powder,</hi> but after they had opened them, and not knowing
what to do therewith, they left the <hi>Barrels carelesly open,</hi> and scattered

               </hi> and <hi>destroyed many</hi> of the Indians, upon which
