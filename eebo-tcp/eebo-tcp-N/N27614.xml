            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE mourning of affectionate ſurvivors for deceaſed friends, prevails among all kindreds and languages on earth without exception; it is co-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with death's unlimited ſway, and will deſcend down through the unborn ages of all future time, 'till the univerſal conqueror ſhall be ſubdued. The cuſtom is not blameable, but eminently laudable, as evincing a tender ſuſceptible diſpoſition which both Reaſon and Revelation approve.</p>
            <p>THE mourning of States and Nations over con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous merit departed, is likewiſe common and equally commendable. When tranſcendently uſeful characters are removed, the loſs muſt be ſeverely felt, and will be ſincerely deplored. Let the lamentations of both kinds proceed even to an extreme—palliating circumſtances may induce us to commiſerate the extravagance as a pardonable weakneſs, rather than blame it as a criminal exceſs. Correſponding appearances of the impreſſions made will be diſplayed,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:036802_0003_100B10F999CD25F8"/>
lively evidences of them will be exhibited, on every ſuitable occaſion. Should theſe indications of inward diſtreſs alſo paſs moderate bounds, ſympathetic ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators will again find an adequate apology. Perſons dear to us as our own ſouls are taken forever away. "The ſurvivors die"—no teſtimony of regard ſeems too great to beſtow on their precious memories. With equal readineſs the heart and hand expand to atteſt our veneration for the father of his country, for the friend of mankind called from the land of the living. Superior attainments in religious excellence may give ſome an extraordinary ſelf-command, which enables them to controul the uſual tenderneſs of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, ſo as to reſtrain expreſſions of grief within ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber limits. Such acquiſitions will ſhew their reality in an habitual courſe of exemplary virtue; where this is wanting, and a ſteady attention is paid to the dictates of cool deliberate ſaving, under ſore bereavements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we perceive not the energy of religious principle, but genuine proofs of an unfeeling and inſenſible make. We do well then to imitate the conduct of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews mentioned in the text, when a ſimilar occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence brings it to our remembrance, and recommends it our adoption.</p>
            <p>THE favorite of God and Man for whom they ſorrowed, gave early preſages of future eminence, and 'till near the fortieth year of his life in which he fell, undeviatingly realized their fond expectations. It is no wonder if they wailed their irreparable loſs in unuſual ſtrains of woe. To mourn for him was made an ordinance in Iſrael to be annually obſerved,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:036802_0004_100B10FB945CFB70"/>
a book of lamentations was compoſed for the purpoſe. When any ſignal calamity befel them afterwards, they compared their diſtreſs to the mourning for Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah, as the moſt expreſſive repreſentation of its dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful extremity.—May no vengeful hand be permitted to renew the degree and extent of ſorrow excited in our Nation by the melancholy event which we now commemorate.</p>
            <p>IT has been obſerved that the practice of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in this reſpect reſts on the beſt and ſoundeſt-principles. Nature has implanted in our hearts ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der paſſions, which muſt therefore have objects adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to work upon them, and call forth their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Without the laſt the firſt would prove unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and improper. Nor does religion condemn their exerciſe, or attempt to deſtroy their exiſtence, but cheriſhes and improves them both by precept and example. Peruſe David's lamentation over Saul and Jonathan, whereby you will learn the ſenſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a Hero and a Saint under the ſore preſſure of deep-felt ſorrow. "Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew upon you, neither let there be rain upon you, nor fields of offerings.—The beauty of Iſrael is ſlain on the high places; how are the mighty fallen and the weapons of war periſhed." Solomon tells us there is a time to weep and a time to mourn; but a greater than Solomon is here; Jeſus wept; he wept at the death of a friend; he wept over the approaching ruin of Jeruſalem; his conduct juſtifies the indulgence of private and public affections, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting both to be raiſed by ſuitable occurrences<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:036802_0005_100B10FD983A2600"/>
While on earth he was a man of ſorrows and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with grief. He died for ſinners, and now exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to glory inconceivable, he is touched with the feeling of human infirmity. May we be effectually engaged to rely on Him as our only Saviour from the tyranny of ſin, and the reſtorer of our ſpiritual free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>THE meditations we are engaged in further ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſh us to enlarge our views, that we may realize the vanity of the ſurrounding ſcene, with relation to its preſent uncertainty and final conſummation. Lo mighty Empires riſe and fall! the power of one paſſes to the hands of another; conſtant revolutions agitate our trembling aſtoniſhed globe; multitudes are buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employed in pulling down and in building up; myriads of human beings anxiouſly contrive and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently execute, according to the endleſs variety of parts aſſigned them, and the infinite diverſity of ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations in which they are placed. Soon will the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs actors finiſh the drama to make room for oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, 'till the ſtage be removed. A few years of rapid flight will lay the whole preſent generation low; their ſucceſſors muſt ſhare the ſame fate, and ere long the end will come. Deſolation haſtens to overwhelm the moſt finiſhed productions of nature, and the moſt durable monuments of art. Our own much loved country, not long ſince the theatre of eager and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain ſtrife, where freedom's intrepid defenders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended valiantly in her cauſe, and eſtabliſhed her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, muſt partake in the univerſal ruin and ſink into nothing. But what becomes of thoſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036802_0006_100B10FFBA94B828"/>
patriots, who reſented her wrongs, who vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated her rights, and repelled ignominious ſlavery from her affrighted ſhores? Muſt they periſh in like manner, muſt they be obliterated from the ſcale of exiſtence, and extinguiſhed in the common maſs of deſtruction? No—they awake from the repoſe of the grave, they ariſe out of their own ruins to live again.</p>
            <p>WHILE we look forward with ſolicitude to the diſſolution of the elements, and a triumphant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, our proper buſineſs is to act our parts well, to perform faithfully the duties required in every progreſſive ſtage of our continuance, attending to the diſtinct calls and claims of each. The obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of this hour directs us to examine more fully than we have yet done, the talents, the qualities and functions of our firſt of citizens, whoſe death has occaſioned the preſent meeting, whoſe death United America deplores, whoſe death, I am almoſt tempted to add, a widowed world bewails.</p>
            <p>WHEN we reflect on the number, ability and zeal of his admirers, on the time elapſed ſince his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval, on the elegance, eloquence and ſublimity of eulogies conſecrated to his memory, it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed that the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> is exhauſted—but the theme is inexhauſtable! And though a repetition of ſome things becomes unavoidable, it muſt gratify us to join the univerſal voice by conſidering the ſubject in our own peculiar way, according to our previous conceptions of its nature and excellence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:036802_0007_100B11023251F158"/>THO' various appointments civil and military were conferred on him, and honorably executed by him, notwithſtanding his juvenile years, previous to the defeat of Gen. <hi>Braddock,</hi> in the year 1755; yet my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations ſhall commence with that memorable event, which ſpread more trepidation and diſmay through America, than the moſt brilliant victory at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved by our enemies during the whole revolution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary war. On that inglorious and diſgraceful day GEORGE WASHINGTON acted as a volunteer aid to the Britiſh commander, and it is ſaid he was the only officer on horſeback who withdrew from the bloody field without a wound. More ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed than moſt, braving danger with that fearleſs intrepidity which never forſook him, no hoſtile wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon proſpered, which aimed to injure or take away his life. This and ſimilar uncommon deliverances from apparently inevitable PERILS, made a Clergy-man of our Church expreſs himſelf thus in a printed note on a diſcourſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Rev. <hi>Samuel Davies,</hi> then a citizen of Virginia, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards Preſident of New-Jerſey College.</note> "As a remarkable inſtance of a martial ſpirit, I may point out to the public that heroic youth Colonel WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, whom I cannot but hope provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has hitherto preſerved in ſo ſignal a manner for ſome important ſervice to his country." How prophetic a hope! how completely realized in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quel! how ſtriking the interpoſition of that Being, who can cover the warrior's head in the day of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle! But I cite the paſſage to ſhew you further the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036802_0008_100B110436D12848"/>
expectations he muſt have raiſed, and the eſtimation in which he muſt have been held at an early period, to juſtify the remark from a very reſpectable author. Theſe will inform you ſufficiently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner he <hi>had</hi> conducted himſelf, and how perfectly the commencement of his effulgent day agreed with its progreſs and concluſion.</p>
            <p>IT is not neceſſary to ſpecify the ſhare he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bore in the then war, on retiring from which he formed a moſt auſpicious conjugal union, and purſued the dignified occupation of a farmer, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving a large eſtate with commendable induſtry and ſucceſs; fulfilling his engagements with punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilious honor; inſpiring with uncommon reſpect every deſcription of citizens, avoiding oſtentation and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade, but ſupporting an elegant hoſpitality, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing a handſome ſtile of living, ſuited to the opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of his circumſtances. In this interval like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, he accepted the truſt of Delegate to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Virginia, and of Magiſtrate on the Judiciary Bench of his county. How well he improved the opportunities thereby afforded him to underſtand ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil rights, and learn to reſpect them, fully ſhone thro' his ſubſequent behavior on many tempting and trying occurrencies.</p>
            <p>A CRISIS approached which brought him to act in a more conſpicuous ſphere. It became neceſſary for the American people to aſſert their privileges by an union of Councils, to denounce encroachments made on them, and expoſe certain ruinous principles adopted, which threatened their total ſubverſion.

               </gap>ting of deputies from the thirteen provinces into which they were at that time divided. And it ſo happened, without the exiſtence of any prejudice or partiality; without the diſcrimination being deſigned, that native ſons of America were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally ſelected on the great conjuncture. A review of the appointments revealed a remarkable fact, which I mention as truly honorable to the American cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. Our future protector attended that auguſt aſſembly, inferior to none ever elected to tranſact our political concerns.</p>
            <p>IT ſoon appeared that a ſharper weapon than the pen muſt be employed—the ſword was drawn, and entruſted to the hands of GEORGE WASHING<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, as commander in chief, by an unanimous vote of Congreſs, cordially ſeconded by the warm appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of their conſtituents. Willingly would he have declined the commiſſion, and preferred any other man who might be ſuppoſed qualified to fill the elevated and enviable office. No ſuch man could be found—the ſalvation of his country called on <hi>him</hi> to accept the high truſt, and he obeyed the call. For a while his want of military experience was reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a diſadvantage; other military characters were therefore looked to for ſupplying the defect. The fallacy and folly of theſe impreſſions ſoon yielded under convincing evidences of the contrary, and he gradually roſe to the ſummit of unbounded confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Civil authorities ſeemed to depreciate; ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, diſtruſt and jealouſy threatened extenſive miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief

—but all believed in him as their bond of union and centre of ſecurity. While he lived and led our armies, we thought ourſelves ſafe, if our ſafety under Providence, was to be accompliſhed. Severe reverſes tranſiently tarniſhed his glory; provoking diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments deeply wounded the feelings of his manly breaſt—ſtill he bore up with unbending firmneſs. Accumulated diſaſters and unparalleled trials could not ſhake his confidence. Terror and conſternation ſeized the thouſands of Iſrael—yet he remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved and immovable; never deſpairing, never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, always prepared to improve every opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and make the beſt of every ſituation. No dread of reproach, no impatience for the glare of momentary conqueſt could tempt him to hazard the fate of his country, or relinquiſh thoſe prudent maxims which his enlightened judgment embraced and confided in for ultimate ſucceſs. How vigilant and diſcerning was he in chuſing ſuitable inſtruments to retrieve or conduct affairs thro' the vaſt, the extended variety of the hoſtile ſcene? Whoſe merits did he ever refuſe to appreciate; whoſe glory did he attempt to dimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh; at whoſe praiſe did he ſicken, tho' his own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary ſacrifices and maſterly arrangements laid the foundations of their fame? His mighty ſoul diſdained emotions from the moſt hateful, perhaps the moſt general paſſion that diſgraces human beings. View him at the head of an undiſciplined mutable army, incompetently officered, ſuffering intolerable hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips from various ſources.—Obſerve him ſoothing refractory civil functionaries, uniting divided coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, reconciling diſcordant intereſts, conducting cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondencies,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036802_0011_100B110AC2A05D00"/>
whoſe diverſity, magnitude and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity were ſufficient to engroſs the time and reflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions of an individual without other employment.— Conſider him preſſed by all this huge weight of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated buſineſs—then aſk, what civility, written or verbal, did not he acknowledge? What attention did not he return, thro' the whole, even down to the inferior compliment of a common ſalute? Such traits afford intelligent obſervers the cleareſt inſight into the human character, and enable them to make a juſt eſtimate of its real worth. Great minds alone can attend to what is great and ſmall in their proper place and connexion—which will not be permitted to make mutual encroachments, nor will the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the one abſorb a regard for the other.</p>
            <p>WHEN our finally victorious and apparently ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected army were almoſt ready to revolt—when treated in their opinion with injuſtice and cruelty, ſome meditated redreſs by the terror of their arms— how tempting a proſpect opened for an ambitious leader to gratify the feveriſh wiſhes of his heart, and ſeize that prize for which ſeas of blood have been often ſhed? Without a pang of ſuſpenſe or an inſtant of heſitation, this leader arreſts the riſing ſpirit with irreſiſtible deciſion, quells the dangerous tumult, and reſtores a perfect calm. To the uninterrupted reſpect he paid the civil rights of mankind; to the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he invariably ſhewed for the laws, together with-his farewell addreſs and ſubſequent perſonal deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we may without offence aſcribe in part a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar characteriſtic in that highly and juſtly celebrated

band. No army ever reſtored to their country ſo large a proportion of orderly, induſtrious citizens, who cheerfully reſumed the occupations of civil life, and ſucceſsfully cultivated the uſeful arts of peace.</p>
            <p>IT is not an article in the creed of a Republican or of a Chriſtian, that the ſafety of a country de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the life and actions of any one man. This was acknowledged here during the continuance of our Revolutionary War; at the ſame time it was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently prayed—it became the prayer of America, that we might not be put to the trial of carrying on that war under the direction of any other command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The ſupplication met a gracious hearing.—Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his auſpices the important conteſt concluded in ſplendor and proſperity; Independence reſted on a ſolid baſis; our nation took rank among Thrones and Dominions under the ſun, and he retired to his farm covered with glory, followed by the ſincere ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes of grateful and admiring millions.</p>
            <p>HIS native State, wiſhing to expreſs the lively ſenſe they entertained of his tranſcendent worth and mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent atchievments, came forward with an offer in the moſt delicate manner, which he might have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted without impeaching his reputation in the ſmalleſt degree. Subordinate commanders accepted ſimilar compliments for inferior performances, nor did or could the leaſt imputation attach to their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, in any reſpect. Had he complied with the propoſal, not the only one made, it would have been followed by others of the ſame kind; it would have grown into faſhion; we ſhould have beheld rival

States contending for pre-eminence in grateful retri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions. But his reſolution was, when he aſſumed the ſupreme military command, in his own empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic words, "to ſhut his hand againſt every pecunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry recompence"—from which nothing could move him thro' the whole of his future public courſe.—He had no deſcendants to provide for, you may ſurmiſe, and therefore inſinuate that he had no inducement to augment his eſtate—Say then ye ſagacious judges of human nature, whether thirſt and queſt of gain ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively apply to thoſe who have poſterity to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grandiſe and enrich, while they reach not hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved by parental feelings? The experience and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the preſent day—the recorded experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and obſervation of the days that are paſt throw contempt upon your poſition, and furniſh its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete refutation. He that loveth ſilver ſhall not be ſatisfied with ſilver, nor he that loveth abundance with increaſe, but conſtantly covet additional ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies: whereas he whoſe native grandeur of mind raiſes him above the ignoble and ſordid attachment, remains contented with his poſſeſſions, and diſplays the independence of a diſintereſted ſpirit, which holds it more bleſſed to give than to receive. Conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to theſe obſervations we repreſent our now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted benefactor declining emoluments annexed to his public functions, refuſing rewards for ſuperemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent exploits, patroniſing deſigns of public utility, conſidering the poor with judicious attention, and completing the benevolent catalogue by the diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions of his laſt teſtament.</p>

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:036802_0014_100B1110B2348618"/>THE Government firſt adopted for the Union proved eſſentially defective, inadequate to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of its inſtitution—a change became indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly neceſſary. A Convention was called to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the arduous work, from whoſe enlightened la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors proceeded our invaluable Federal Conſtitution. As his engaging in that ſervice might not prove te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious or ſevere, and as all the wiſdom of his counſel and all the weight of his authority were neceſſary to aſſiſt and ſanction the proceedings—his aid was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected—the late Commander of our Armies accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly conſented to accept a new civil appointment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and preſided in the Aſſembly. Having diſcharged this truſt with faithfulneſs and ability, we might ſuppoſe him excuſed from every future employment of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic nature.</p>
            <p>A harder taſk awaited him than any yet attempted. Who ſhall preſide in introducing the adopted frame; in arranging its departments; in adminiſtering its executive branches; in eſtabliſhing precedents to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulate its future operations? Many pens were brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed againſt it; many ſhafts were aimed at it, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the venerable ſanction it could boaſt;— violent oppoſition was dreaded; the diſſolution of the Union was apprehended. What wiſdom of counſel and weight of authority equal this exigence? Will WASHINGTON the Great commit himſelf in a ſtation, where it is impoſſible but offences muſt come? Will he hazard on ſo ſtormy and perilous an ocean a richer treaſure than ever was embarked? How imminent the danger of being wrecked; how

incalculable the loſs! Had not he loved his country more than he valued his renown, he would have repoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the ſhade of thoſe laurels which ſpread over him their unfading verdure. But perſonal conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions yielded before public obligations; &amp; he received from the unanimous deciſion of his fellow-citizens the higheſt office they had power to beſtow. High office indeed, of immenſe reſponſibility and uncertain iſſue! Wonderful Man—combining ſuch various and rare talents, and devoting them invariably to the public good!</p>
            <p>WHAT competition, what contention, what exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have been exhibited in Europe to gain Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land's once elective crown, inferior in conſequence to the preſidency of the United States? There the requiſite unanimity reſulted from fear and terror, from intrigue and art, from bribery and corruption —here the union of choice was unſought and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bought, free and unconſtrained—out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the heart the mouth ſpoke. The ſame harmony of ſuffrage was renewed, and would have been repeated, had not the ſecure diſtinction been explicitly declined.</p>
            <p>IN conducting a civil adminiſtration, among a free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple eſpecially where the ſcene is new &amp; untried, multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied difficulties will unavoidably occur. Every citizen has a right to think for himſelf—to judge of govermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal meaſures—to declare his ſentiments.—A great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of opinions muſt unavoidably prevail—fault will often be found with what is done, and with what is left undone, however the caſe may be. Many
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:036802_0016_100B11159BEC4508"/>
appointments are to be made. Applicants for offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial honors and emoluments are numerous, earneſt and urgent. Inſinuation and addreſs, importunity and miſrepreſentation will exert their influence, and miſlead in ſpite of the moſt upright intentions. It is not within the compaſs of limited fagacity to make always the beſt ſelection, it is not an attribute of man to be infallible—'tis not in the nature of things poſſible to prevent exceptions and give univerſal ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. Granting theſe ſeveral conſiderations their full force, what judgment would be paſſed on preſident Waſhington's adminiſtration, when he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined the helm. Concerning David it is ſaid, ſave in one inſtance—which we muſt und<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>tand in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with its concomitants and conſequences— "he did that which was right in the eyes of the Lord, and turned not aſide from any thing that he commanded him all the days of his life." Perhaps a ſimilar qualified encomium on our firſt ſupreme magiſtrate would be concurred in even by thoſe who withheld an approbation of all his meaſures, with this luminous atteſtation in favor of conſummate internal rectitude; that at no period of his exiſtence, had they any reaſon, or pretended any reaſon, to queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion his ardent unabating zeal to promote the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of America.</p>
            <p>AFTER he has moved in the higheſt ſphere ſo long, is it not preſumable that the fruition of it has grown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a fixed habit with him, rendering the continuance a deſirable, an indiſpenſable inherritance? The acquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of chief command is the foremoſt wiſh of noble minds
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:036802_0017_100B1117A2633518"/>
—the deſire of it is called their laſt infirmity. Weak and unfortunate rulers may have been driven into obſcurity by weakneſs or misfortune—but "to deſcend voluntarily from the ſupreme to a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſtation, and to relinquiſh the poſſeſſion of power in order to attain the enjoyment of happineſs, ſeems to be an effort too great for the human mind." Such is the beautiful reflexion of Dr. <hi>Robertſon,</hi> when mentioning the Abdication of <hi>Diocletian</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the 5th. However great the effort is, it has been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played before our eyes under circumſtances rendering it peculiarly ſtriking and extraordinary. The abdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating Emperors had already "impaired their conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, and brought on the infirmities of old age." The retiring Preſident retained the full health and ſtrength, the vigor and activity of a ſtrong body and ſound mind, equal to the functions of his elevation, and fitted to reliſh the faſcinating charms of his grandeur. But theſe were not the motives for his conſenting to appear at the head of a mighty nation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> When his country could ſpare his agency, no induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment remained with him to continue in her ſervice, and he reſolved once more, "to paſs the remainder of his days in honorable repoſe, and place his glory beyond the reach of fortune."</p>
            <p>But will he again put all to riſque, if that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's ſafety requires it? Will he relinquiſh beloved retirement in declining years, to encounter the viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitudes of doubtful war? When he might have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, will he ſtoop to a grade which requires to obey? Matchleſs example of real magnanimity and

inflexible patriotiſm. Thro' the whole of his diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sified career the applauſes of his fellow citizens were beyond parallel. Wherever he went, acclamations accompanied him; glowing addreſſes poured on him from every quarter. Nothing is more likely to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicate the firmeſt mind, making it inattentive to the frailty and mutability of humanity. Aſſailed by theſe, and knowing he was the theme of exuber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant praiſe in many different lands, his moderation and equanimity preſerved their influence undiminiſhed, unimpaired—no aſſuming airs of conſequence, no diſplays of ſelf-importance, no indications of inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence marked a ſingle word of his mouth, or action of his life. With what humility did he piouſly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the interpoſition of Providence at proper ſeaſons, and recommend a reliance on Almighty God for national bleſſings—How anxious was he to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſe co-operation and aſſiſtance in tranſactions where he might have claimed excluſive merit? Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paſſing thro' a ſcene of ſo much celebrity, what old acquaintance did he forget; of what former friend was he aſhamed; whoſe ſociety did he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, among circles that knew him and were known by him previous to the era of his ſeductive elevation? This is Republican, in his life you have—in his life you had, a living lecture on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicaniſm—with heart-felt exultation I add that, he died in the Republican ſaith.</p>
            <p>ATTEND the hero and ſtateſman to the ſhade you find him entirely conſiſtent, his private de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment augments the luſtre of his public reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

His character, in public and in private, is ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by no vice, disfigured by no vain affectation, no diſguſting peculiarity or pitiable weakneſs, which have repeatedly debaſed the moſt exalted names. At the feat of his reſidence you trace the order and regularity of a camp without its rigor, diſcovering the ſound clear underſtanding which will ſhew itſelf in every walk. His conduct may be compared to his ſtyle in compoſition, for they bear a ſtrong re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of each other in dignity, uniformity, and propriety. Were I obliged to deſignate the moſt prominent feature in his rich portrait, perhaps my opinion would ſelect the talent diſplayed by his writings. Deſtitute as he was of a learned education, and untrained in ſtudies favorable to the exerciſe of the pen, his literary productions, are of themſelves ſufficient to ſecure for their author an everlaſting me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial.</p>
            <p>THUS far have we proceeded in our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neation without perceiving any blemiſh, to wound our feelings, or make us change the general ſtrain of well-earned praiſe.

ſome afflictive revolutions await America's favorite Son, whom we have till now beheld with unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble complacency and approbation. No, the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God who gave him being, and diſtinguiſhed his day with an uninterrupted flow of proſperity, was pleaſed to continue his beneficence till the ſhort ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which laid him low. Do you wiſh to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the mild radiance of his ſetting ſun? Alas, that ſun is ſet forever. I am able to gratify your deſire by reading a letter from the Rev. Dr. MUIR, of Alexandria, written the 19th December, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains an intereſting detail of particulars reſpecting the death we unfeignedly deplore.</p>
            <p>"I RECEIVED yours laſt evening, upon my return from attending the remains of our illuſtrious neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to the tomb—Friday the 13th, he had been riding among his farms, the day was damp and cold, he felt a little unwell at bed time, before morning he was extremely ill. He was unwilling to ſend for his phyſician, Dr. CRAIK, during the night, but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing bleeding might relieve him, one of his over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers who had been accuſtomed to bleed, was called in to do this office, and Dr. CRAIK was ſent for in the morning. He found him ſitting up, but was greatly alarmed at his ſituation. He bled him a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, and called in Dr. <hi>Dick,</hi> with whom to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult; Dr. <hi>Brown,</hi> from Port Tobacco had alſo been ſent for. Dr. <hi>Dick</hi> bled him a third time. The diſorder was the croup. When Dr. <hi>Dick</hi> arrived breathing was difficult, and he ſwallowed with pain, yet he endeavored to get down whatever medicines
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:036802_0021_100B111F6518E708"/>
were preſcribed. He deſired Mrs. <hi>Waſhington</hi> who was in the room, to take a certain key and bring him two papers. He looked over them with care. Take that one, ſaid he, and put it in the fire, this one is my laſt will. He ſpoke little, finding it almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to articulate. Towards the concluſion of the day he ſaid to the phyſicians: "Gentlemen, you have done your duty, let me now die in peace." Then he undreſſed and went to bed. He enquired at 9 and 10 the hour. "I die hard ſaid he to his phyſicians, but I hope I have nothing to fear." A few minutes before he expired, he ſaid, my breath grows very ſhort, and at the moment of death ſhut his own eyes and mouth, and went off without a groan. Theſe circumſtances ſhew great ſtrength of mind, which even death could not ſhake. The corpſe retained marks of firmneſs impreſſed in the countenance which could not be obſerved without aſtoniſhment and reſpect: I ſuppoſed you would be gratified by theſe circumſtances, which I know from the Phyſicians themſelves, &amp; therefore cannot queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their Accuracy."</p>
