            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>MANKIND, when addreſſed upon intereſting ſubjects, uſually with to know ſomething of the perſon, and his motives, by whom they are addreſſed.</p>
            <p>THIS neceſſary information, when ſufficiently obtained, generally removes all grounds of deception and conſequent diſſatisfaction.</p>
            <p>IN conformity to theſe ſentiments, the Author of the following Addreſs, informs the Reader, that, he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly reſided in the City, during the calamity of 1793, 1797, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent year: and, has ſeen, felt, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered much, therein: which, from time to time, has given riſe to various obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations and reflections, that are here preſented to public view.</p>
            <p>THE principal objects, of this publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, are neither fame, nor pecuniary emoluments: ſubjects of far greater mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude and conſequence; the glory of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:033464_0004_0FF7401CECE92588"/>
God—the reformation and ſalvation of the inhabitants of this City—the good of mankind—and, his own peace of mind —have, as far as he knows his own heart, been his leading motives.</p>
            <p>IN attempting a work of this kind, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſcouragements have ariſen, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly a ſenſe of unfitneſs and inability; but knowing the terrors of the Lord, and feeling a woe from God denounced againſt him, if he did not, in this way, endeavour to perſuade men to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; he has endeavoured to comply, under a conſtraining ſenſe of religious duty; deſiring to commit its effects to God, who is able to carry on his deſigns in whatever way he pleaſes; and, does frequently make uſe of weak, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently very unlikely means, to anſwer important and beneficial purpoſes.</p>

            <head>AN ADDRESS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>FEELING, as I apprehend, an ardent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for the promotion of the cauſe of truth and righteouſneſs in the earth; and viewing the preſent diſpenſation—as,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> A Judgment from God, <hi>Secondly,</hi> A Judgment mixed with mercy. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> A Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deſigned for the puniſhment of ſin; and the reformation and benefit of mankind.—And <hi>Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> As a Judgment, that, unleſs ſuitably attended to, will probably be followed by more vindictive tokens of divine diſpleaſure.</p>
            <p>I SHALL, in attending to this Judgment, under this fourfold view, intreat you in the firſt place, to view it as coming from God. Oh, the duty, the indiſpenſible duty of profeſſed chriſtians to acknowledge God, not only in all their own, but in all his ways.</p>
            <p>IN times of calamity, eſpecially ſuch as the preſent, as well as in proſperity; the enemy of all righteouſneſs, is buſy, very buſy, not only with the openly wicked and profane; but, alſo, not unfrequently, with the more thoughtful and conſcientious; if poſſible, to bewilder and divert their minds from the truth; thereby to deprive
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:033464_0006_0FF740C40F39BC50"/>
God of the glory, and mankind of the benefit, that would otherwiſe enſue. And no marvel the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is thus buſy! for of all the diſpenſations of divine providence, perhaps, none has a more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect tendency to bring the mind home to God. than the preſent if rightly underſtood: but this will be more fully conſidered in its proper place.</p>
            <p>NOT only the grand adverſary immediately, but likewiſe worldly wiſdom inſtrumentally, ſerves to perplex and obſcure divine truths, agreeably to that ſcripture declaration "The world by wiſdom knew not God."<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. i. 21.</note> Neither does it by its own wiſdom clearly underſtand his operations, either in a way of Judgment or mercy.</p>
            <p>THE holy ſcriptures, in relating God's Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon Pharaoh, and the Egyptians, mention the inſtrumentality of Moſes and Aaron, and the Rod of God, &amp;c. in bringing and oftentimes in removing moſt of the diſpenſations, excepting the peſtilence. In that, nothing of the inſtrumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Moſes or Aaron appear to have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; but the immediate Hand of God, or his deſtroying angel, dealt the avenging, the irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blow. Some of the diſpenſations were attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be imitated and accounted for, by the magicians, and other wiſe men of Egypt, by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cauſes. But the peſtilence, or plague, was a diſpenſation; the Egyptians, and even the
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:033464_0007_0FF74038067C8D90"/>
hard hearted Pharaoh viewed as coming imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from God, and bowed before it as ſuch, and obeyed the Lord by letting his people depart, according to his commands.<note n="*" place="bottom">Exod. vii. xii.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE ſcriptures alſo in relating the plague that was ſent upon the Philiſtines for detaining the ark of God, mention it, not only as ſent by the immediate Hand of God; but, as ſo viewed by the Philiſtines themſelves, at leaſt by their prieſts and diviners, when they adviſed them to give glory to the God of Iſrael; and not to harden their hearts, as the Egyptians and Pharoah had done. And though it ſeems theſe prieſts and diviners, afterwards, got into a doubting ſtate, (like ſome at the preſent day) concerning the great evil, that happened unto them; whether it was the Hand of the Lord? or ſomething, that came upon them by chance? Yet God, in the courſe of his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, cauſed their own predictions to be verified in ſuch a manner, as to prove beyond a doubt, that his hand and not a blind chance directed the plague that was upon the Philiſtines and their lords; for removing and obſtructing the inſtitutions of his worſhip.<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Samuel, v. vi.</note>
            </p>
            <p>DAVID in ſcriptures ſtiled a man after God's own heart viewed the peſtilence as coming imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately from the hand of God; for when famine, war, and peſtilence, were propoſed unto him, for
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:033464_0008_0FF740CB9B45EF00"/>
his ſelection or choice, he choſe the peſtilence in preference to either of the other calamities, as he viewed it under the more immediate agency and direction of the moſt high.</p>
            <p>AND when the peſtilence came, and David was permitted to ſee the cauſe of the people's deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; nothing either from the air, or from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the long train of ſecond cauſes ſeemed to claim any ſhare therein, but the angel of the Lord appeared to be the immediate diſpenſer of death<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Samuel. xxxiv.</note>
            </p>
            <p>SO in the caſe of Sennacherib, King of Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, who by his meſſenger, reproached the living God; and by himſelf and his army threatened to bring deſtruction upon Jeruſalem: blaſphemouſly entertaining and expreſſing unbelief of God's pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and ſufficiency to deliver the people that truſted in him:—The peſtilence deſtroyed the army of this blaſphemous and unbelieving King.—By means of ſecond cauſes? No; they fell by the immediate hand of the angel of God:—Who in one night, a fatal night! ſmote with death, One Hundred and Eighty Five Thouſand!<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſaiah. xxxvi. xxviii.</note>
            </p>
            <p>OTHER inſtances, might be mentioned from ſcripture to prove the immediate and direct agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Almighty in the peſtilence, without the intervention of that train of ſecond cauſes, ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly inſtrumental in the generating and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of moſt other diſeaſes: But, the foregoing,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033464_0009_0FF7403EDD3975E8"/>
being (I think) ſo much in point; and as, I wiſh to ſtudy brevity as far as conſiſtent with perſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuity, I ſhall not enlarge from ſcripture under, this head.</p>
            <p>COMMON hiſtory, if conſulted, would no doubt in many inſtances, confirm the belief of God's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate agency, in all diſpenſations like the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; but I ſhall now confine my obſervations prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally to what relates immediately to this city.</p>
            <p>SOMETHING like a ſpecimen of the preſent ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, was foreſeen<note n="*" place="bottom">See Thomas Chalkley's Journal, page 205.</note>, foretold and realized; more than half a century paſt: but a kind providential language ſeemed to be; how ſhall I give thee up, O Philadelphia!</p>
            <p>BUT in 1793, an alarm was ſounded! A trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of divine diſpleaſure blown! A diſpenſation ſent! Before which, the loftineſs of man, was bowed down, the haughtineſs of men laid low and the Lord alone was exalted, with many in that day. The men of knowledge, the men of ſcience, the men of the wiſdom of this world, attempted to fathom the cauſe, but moſt of them failed; their aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in ſome inſtances were not ſtrictly true, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing to others, or ſatisfactory to their own minds. The firſt report of common fame, (which ſometimes ſpeaks true) was, "The plague has broke out in Water-ſtreet."</p>
            <p>ON ſome of thoſe fatal days, about the 10th of the 10 Month (October) 1793: when all faces ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:033464_0010_0FF740CF8F4EE260"/>
blackneſs, the bands of ſociety ſeemed diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and human nature ſhuddered and almoſt ſunk under feeling apprehenſions of God's with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing his ſupport, his preſence, and his protection from this city: Who, then doubted of his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately directing the dreadful ſcourge?</p>
            <p>MOST, if not all, were convinced it was a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſent by the immediate hand of God:—And that nothing but the ſame hand or power could remove it.</p>
            <p>MANY were brought very low, the prevailing language then was, Lord, ſave me! Only carry me through this diſpenſation alive, and I will ſerve thee forever!</p>
            <p>THE Lord heard—In the midſt of wrath, he remembered mercy—The diſorder ſtopt—By what means? By the Lord's ſaying to the deſtroying Angel which ſmote the people; It is enough; ſtay now thine hand.</p>
            <p>MY ſoul is often humbly affected both for myſelf and others on account of broken cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants: did proffeſſors of religion; or others keep their covenants made, in thoſe hours of ſore diſtreſs and bitterneſs of ſoul, from the loweſt depths of woe with Almighty God?</p>
            <p>THE ſucceeding more than uſual pomp and parade of faſhion—The unabated, increaſed and the inſatiable thirſt after riches, vanities, ſinful pleaſures and vain amuſements: ſhewed but too plainly, great forgetfulneſs—great neglect—great

            <p>THE widow's gloom was ſcarcely removed— parents tears had not ceaſed to flow—nor the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives ſigh, forgot to heave; in remembrance of laſt year's<note n="*" place="bottom">1797.</note> calamity; when the dread alarm again aſſailed our tingling ears—approached our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frighted habitations—and ſiezed our troubled minds.

               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:033464_0013_0FF7404BADBEE830"/>HAS not the ſtate of the city, in ſome meaſure, been ſimilar to the lamentable ſituation of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, as deſcribed by the prophet Jeremiah.<note n="*" place="bottom">Lament. i. 1, &amp;c.</note> Does not the city ſit ſolitary, that was full of people?

            <p>AGAIN, how ſolemn, how earneſt, was the prophet Iſaiah, in his denunciation upon, and expoſtulation with the Jews formerly? (In order, effectually, to bring them off from all vain hopes, and improper expectations, of eſcaping the right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eous judgments of God.) When, (in language, no doubt, applicable to the preſent time and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation) he thus addreſſed them, "Becauſe ye have ſaid, we have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agreemement: when the overflowing ſcourge ſhall paſs through, it ſhall not come unto us: for we have made lies our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and under falſehood have we hid ourſelves.

with death ſhall be diſannulled, and your agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with hell ſhall not ſtand; when the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing ſcourge ſhall paſs through, then ſhall ye be trodden down by it. From the time that it goeth forth ſhall it take you: for morning by morning ſhall it paſs over, by day and by night; and it ſhall be a vexation only to underſtand the report. For the Lord ſhall riſe up as in Mount Perazim, he ſhall be wroth as in the Valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his ſtrange work; and bring to paſs his act, his ſtrange act.</p>
            <p>"NOW therefore, be ye not mockers, leſt your bands be made ſtrong: for I have heard from the Lord of hoſts a conſumption, even determined, upon the whole earth."<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah. xxviii.</note>
            </p>
            <p>AND may we not ſay of this diſpenſation, as the prophet ſaid in another caſe, "This alſo cometh forth from the Lord of hoſts; which is wonderful in counſel, and excellent in working."<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſaiah. xxviii. 29.</note>
            </p>
            <p>A PARTICULAR attention to the laſt mentioned words, in their diſtinct order, may ſerve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, more fully, of the propriety of their quotation.</p>
            <p>"THIS" This diſpenſation, that hath humbled the pride of man—this calamity—this fever—this peſtilence—this plague—or, whatever name it may be called by:—that hath done, and is doing; that, which nothing but the immediate hand of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033464_0015_0FF74050EB2E4688"/>
God could do: in that, it hath ſhaken the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Satan, to its foundation, in the hearts of many of the inhabitants of this City—that, in a few days, as it were at one ſtroke, hath brought home to the minds of all (not incurably hardened) the belief of a God—his ſuperintending providence —and, immediate agency in this diſpenſation— That hath done at once—what days, weeks, months, years, yea many years, of inſtrumental labours, and lighter calamities, did not effect; evidently "alſo cometh forth from the Lord of hoſts," is an inſcription, in ſuch legible charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, as, that he who runs, may read it upon this judgment, ſo ſecret in approach—ſo ſudden in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack—and, ſo fatal, ſo univerſal in operation: And, as proceeding from him, "which is wonderful in counſel," is one link, in the great chain, of the wonderful counter of God: And, although, at ſome dark times and ſeaſons, the myſtery of iniquity may ſeem very deep; and the kingdom and cauſe of Satan ready to prevail, and triumph in the world. Yet all, I believe, is ordered and directed in unerring wiſdom; and however low and diſcouraging, to the rightly exerciſed chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, the cauſe of God and truth may appear to be in the earth: Yet, it never was, nor ever will be, totally extinct. But ſometimes it appears, that the loweſt depths, ſerve as foundations for the greateſt heights of the teſtimonies of truth; and, for the promotion thereof in the earth. And
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:033464_0016_0FF740E6ADFEFE70"/>
however various and many are the devices of men's hearts, yet the counſel of the Lord! that ſhall ſtand. "And excellent in working." Indeed will God appear to be in this diſpenſation; if ſome of the excellent productions thereof be duly conſidered, in reſpect of many of thoſe individuals, who have improved it aright. Has it not, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances, opened a way for the diſplay of the moſt excellent qualities of the man, and the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian? Such as, ſaith, hope, charity—a weaned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the world—dependance on God alone— repentance—reformation—clear proſpects and foretaſtes of heaven—triumph over death: and, to ſum up all in a word, love to God, and love to men.</p>
            <p>THESE are the Lord's doings! marvellous to us! And will be ſo in the eyes of ſucceeding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations! Amen.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, this Judgment may, in the ſecond place, be viewed as mixed with mercy.</p>
            <p>WELL may the ſurviving inhabitants of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, in adoring language, of the deepeſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and heartfelt gratitude, acknowledge it is of the Lord's mercies that we are not conſumed: And could we be permitted to lift the veil, that ſeparates time from eternity; we ſhould no doubt behold, that the boundleſs mercy of Chriſt, the Mediator, who, when on earth, was called the friend of publicans and ſinners; who came not to
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:033464_0017_0FF7405B76590278"/>
call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance; who received the penitent thief from the croſs into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe: has interceded with his father, in the midſt of wrath, to remember mercy to many poor ſouls; hid, in the vale of poverty and obſcurity; (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps great wickedneſs) from much of the notice and attention of the world—ſeized, as it were in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, with all the terrors—all the horrors of death! Intimate friends, none; or far away—the black ſick carriage at the door—the dreary Hoſpital in view—and Potter's Field in expectation. On high, God an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry for ſin.—Below, Hell yawning to receive. In this ſituation, all that many a poor (though pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious) ſoul could do, was the utterance of a groan or ſigh:—Lord help me! Or caſting a deſponding look toward Heaven, for mercy. In this miſery extreme, I believe the Lord, whoſe tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are over all the works of his hand, has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently looked down from the height of his ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary, and out of Heaven has beheld the earth; not to ſee the pomp and parade of princes; nor the vanities and glories of this world; but to hear the groanings of the (afflicted ſpiritual) priſoner; and to looſe ſuch as ſeemed appointed both to temporal and eternal death: and in their laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, has reached forth ſalvation:—and has raiſed them from the depths of woe on earth, to the heights of joy in Heaven.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:033464_0018_0FF740ECC1E67EF8"/>NEITHER was the diſtreſs, nor mercy of the diſpenſation confined to the abject poor alone:— but the horror and diſtreſs ſeemed as univerſal as ſin—and the mercy of God as boundleſs as the objects that claimed his attention.</p>
            <p>SOME, of all claſſes of citizens, have remained in the city: Numbers from motives of conſcience, (may it not almoſt be ſaid) pure as truth, and diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted as the means of ſalvation. Some remained under a conſtraining neceſſity; ſome to receive benefit themſelves; ſome to impart it to others, generally, all from good motives; or, at leaſt but very few (I believe) from thoſe that were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible.</p>
            <p>NOR were thoſe who fled, worthy of blame:— many fled as influenced by a warning voice, to eſcape impending deſtruction; ſome choſe to, and did continue, almoſt within ſight, and certainly within reach of feeling the diſtreſſes and afflictions of thoſe who remained behind. Almoſt unbounded was the charity of many: and great the anxiety and concern of moſt, if not all, who were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>INDEED the mercy of God was evident in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluencing ſome to go, others to ſtay: had all fled, who would have ſuffered? Had all tarried, who would have eſcaped? Therefore if any glory, for tarrying and being uſeful, let them glory in the Lord; if any rejoice for fleeing and being ſafe, let them rejoice with fear and trembling: and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:033464_0019_0FF6804CC5073758"/>
thoſe who fled, and thoſe who tarried, unite in charitable diſpoſitions—brotherly love—thankful hearts—and reformed lives.</p>
            <p>BUT to return more particularIy to the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of mercy and judgment in this diſpenſation: Solomon ſaid, "money anſwereth all things." <note n="*" place="bottom">Eccles. x. 19,</note> And although a ſcripture phraſe; may perhaps be taken in a more general ſenſe, than the author deſigned: if this has ever been the caſe, many are now undecieved. This calamity was no reſpecter of perſons: money had no charms for the peſtilence Riches could offer no availing bribe to death: as ſaid a celebrated poet:</p>
            <l>"Their golden cordials could not eaſe</l>
            <l>Their pained hearts, and aching heads,</l>
            <l>Nor fright, nor bribe approaching death,</l>

            </l>
            <p>And as on the one hand, riches did not raiſe the minds of men above ſinning; ſo on the other, it did not excuſe them from the bitter cup of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. However captivating riches may appear in the view of moſt men, in times of worldly proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; yet it may be viewed as one of the mercies of this diſpenſation, that riches thereby, were ſet in a true and ſubordinate light: A drop of water to cool the parched tongue, and a fanning breeze of refreſhing air, to allay the ſcorching heat of peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:033464_0020_0FF740F152F681E8"/>
flames; were in many caſes, all the luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the moſt unbounded wealth could give: or the moſt voluptuous receive.</p>
            <p>AN inſtantaneous view of approaching eternity; eclipſed in a moment, all the glory of this world, in the eyes of many, and cut aſunder the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections of time and ſenſe: and the ſoul by an act of faith, caſt upon the unmerited mercy of God alone: immediately received a peace and a ſatisfactory aſſurance, and a ſtayedneſs of mind as far above what this world, in its moſt proſperous ſtate can beſtow: as the heavens are above the earth. And were enabled, by the boundleſs mercy of God, to leave a ſcene, which at beſt, as it related to temporal proſperity, was replete with diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to enter upon a ſtate; glorious in proſpect, perfect in enjoyment, and endleſs in duration!</p>
            <p>GREAT numbers, (charity hopes the greateſt number) of thoſe, who have been removed by this diſpenſation, have given thoſe ſurvivors, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them, in their laſt moments, ſatisfactory hopes of their future well being.</p>
            <p>FOR the juſtneſs of this obſervation; I appeal to ſurviving relatives—religious viſitants—feeling phyſicians, and others:—who attended the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſick, and dying in 1793, 1797, and the preſent year, whether they have not been frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly witneſſes for God; that his judgments have been mixed with unbounded mercy?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:033464_0021_0FF7406972F40D58"/>FREQUENTLY, very frequently! After all that imgination can conceive and often more than any language can expreſs, of horror and deſpair, has been ſeen and heard, in the unutterable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs and anguiſh uſually attending this diſorder; after the moſt heart piercing ſhrieks! terrifying convulſions! and, diſtorting agonies! have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted all their terrors, all their woes! Then, a gleam of extended mercy—a beam of divine light—a ray of immortal glory—has, with ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſplendour, darted through all the horrors of the gloom—the diſtreſſed ſoul, enlivened by the joys of God's ſalvation; breathed high aſpirations for its native land—aſſuming heavenly tranquility, before unknown—triumphing over death and the grave—has quit the abode of clay—and, amid exulting angelic hoſts of guardian ſpirits—wing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its way towards the Paradiſe of God.</p>
            <p>THUS the rich and the poor do meet together: and the Lord is not only the Maker of them all, but likewiſe the Redeemer and Saviour of many; it is to be hoped moſt of them.</p>

            <p>IN enumerating the mercies of God, may we not mention—ſires ſeldom happened; few angry diſputations took place; markets were well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; reſignation and ſtayedneſs upon God were experienced: and his divine preſence, at times, very ſenſibly felt, both in public and private devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

the diſtreſſes of this calamity.

            <p>THE winds and the weather, (ſubordinate mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of providence) have alſo been directed in much mercy.—But in attempting to ſpeak of the mercies of God, I am launching into a boundleſs ocean! they are innumerably made known to us every morning, yea every moment of our lives! and more eſpecially conſpicuous at this time, when contraſted with the afflictive judgments of the preſent diſpenſation.</p>
            <p>THIRDLY. You are now, as in the fear and dread of Almighty God, requeſted to view this awful diſpenſation; as a judgment deſigned for the puniſhment of ſin: and the reformation and benefit of mankind.</p>
            <p>OUR benign creator, who delighteth in mercy doth not afflict willingly, nor grieve the children of men. It is ſin, and ſin alone, that maketh a ſeparation between any people; or any individual and God.</p>

               <p>COVETOUSNESS has intruded upon, and marred, and much injured the original plan of the firſt founder of this City, the truly honourable WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIAM PENN.</p>
               <p>ACCORDING to his deſign, (if I am rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed) no buildings were to be erected between Front ſtreet and the River Delaware. But covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, regardleſs of the beauty—the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence—the natural order—and health of the city; has crowded buildings in a manner, that is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for buſineſs, and deſtructive to the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants.—And viewing this matter in a natural light only, and extending our views no farther than the ſurface of things.—It would, I believe be a great benefit to this city, if every building of the above deſcription were entirely removed: and the vacancy ſupplied by one or two ranges of low and wide ſtores interſected with rows of trees.— And paved or graveled walks. By ſuch or ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar arrangements; The intenſe heat of a Summer's Meridian ſun: its reflected ſultry rays at particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar hours from the ſurface of the river: and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and ſtagnated air from confined and crowd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed houſes, generally deſtitute of yards; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with other inconveniences and diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges too many and too obvious to be particularly

enmerated: would generally be removed, or greatly alleviated and avoided.</p>
               <p>COVETOUSNESS, thus conſidered, has moſt eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially combined, with other cauſes, to mar the beauty—injure the proſperity—and endanger the exiſtence of the city.</p>
               <p>AND here it may be obſerved, that the peſtilence whether originating in natural, or moral cauſes, or both combined; has in its three fatal viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: firſt made its appearance eaſtward of Front-ſtreet.</p>
               <p>THESE effects of covetouſneſs are difficult to obviate, perhaps impoſſible entirely to remove: I ſhall therefore endeavour to turn your attention to the effects of covetouſneſs in points, if not leſs fatal, yet more remediable.</p>
               <p>COVETOUSNESS, when it once gains an aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency in the mind, is one of the moſt dangerous vices: in proof of this, much might be produced from ſcripture and hiſtory, but I ſhall principally confine my obſervations to America in general, and Philadelphia in particular.</p>

Has not covetouſneſs in this city of late, too much taken the place of Induſtry in buſineſs?—Has not the uſe of banks been abuſed—artificial capitals (of ſhort duration) created, imprudent in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement—perplexing in advancement—and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inous in the end?</p>
               <p>COVETOUSNESS, by this diſpenſation, is puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all its branches. The apprentice lad, too cloſely confined, now enjoys a long vacation.— The avaricious landlord, perceives his rents de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining in magnitude and number.—With moſt, the means of acquiſition are few; Thoſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſement many.</p>

               <p>THE Sabbath is an ancient inſtitution prime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val with creation—appointed to man, for reſt from labour, in obedience to the ordinance and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of God.</p>
               <p>IF one day in ſeven, was neceſſary, was uſeful, for man to obſerve, as a day of reſt, while innocent and uncorrupted: How much more ſo now, in his preſent ſtate and ſituation? Surrounded on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſide with perplexing cares; and beſet with bodily and mental imperfections.</p>
               <p>THERE are but few, if any, of the different religious ſocieties in this City, whoſe forefathers or themſelves have not ſuffered in ſome age or nation of the world, in a greater or leſſer degree; diſadvantages, fines, puniſhments of ſome kind, perſecutions, impriſonments, or death, from the iron hand of arbitrary power; for the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious performance of religious worſhip, on this bleſſed day. But praiſed be God! a nation is born! a Government ariſen! a Conſtitution eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed! of which we are a part, and under which we live; that gives to, and protects all, in a full and free liberty of conſcience, in matters of religion and worſhip! How is this important,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:033464_0042_0FF6806C33EC1570"/>
this precious, this ineſtimable privilege improved? Is it improved in a manner that tends to promote God's glory and our benefit?</p>
               <p>THE affairs of this world, neceſſarily, unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, engage much of men's attention, particularly in commercial cities; and without ſuch an inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution as the ſabbath, the mind would be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being entirely engroſſed and overwhelmed in temporal purſuits; and ſome of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant duties of chriſtianity and morality neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and entirely forgotten: Death unregarded, and a future ſtate unthought of, and unprepared for.</p>
               <p>IT will no doubt be readily aſſented to, by all conſiderate perſons, that the ſabbath has in this place heretofore been ſhamefully neglected and diſregarded. The apoſtle Paul, exhorted the people in his day, to be careful in not forſaking the aſſembling together, as the manner of ſome was.</p>
               <p>HERE permit me to aſk, are there not many heads of families, and others, whoſe conduct ſhould be exemplary, that ſeldom, if ever, attend any place of public worſhip? Surely in this city, where twelve or more of different religious deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations meet ſeparately, no perſon can plead excuſe, when in health, for a general courſe of non-attendance, at ſome one of theſe places.</p>

                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:033464_0043_0FF740AFB81B0598"/>COMMON obſervation will juſtify me in ſaying, that the ſabbath, nominally a holy, is with many by far the moſt unholy and ill ſpent day in the week.

               <p>I WISH to enforce this ſubject upon your minds with every degree of weight, that its nature and importance requires: Being convinced in my own mind, that if, in future, ſabbaths are remembered and ſanctified, throughout the city, it will have a powerful tendency to correct vice—eſtabliſh virtue—and thereby procure the divine favour: that ſo, an all powerful and kind providential care, may watch over this city, and all its widely extended concerns— for preſervation, not deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!</p>

What well grounded hopes can reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be entertained for their welfare?</p>
               <p>THE neglect of parents and others, in theſe important reſpects, have, I believe, eſſentially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the preſent calamity; and a ſenſe of theſe fatal neglects, has by this diſpenſation, been brought home to the feelings and conſcience of many an unhappy parent, when on a dying bed, taking a long, an heart rending farewell of their weeping offspring; or viewing a much beloved child, under all the inexpreſſible horrors, of this moſt dreadful of all diſorders! encircled in

inſtances, prove the preſs may be proſtituted to very unworthy purpoſes, particularly printing bad books.</p>
               <p>THE avenues of education and inſtruction, are often obſtructed and corrupted by reaſon of bad books, by their means the attention of youth is forcibly attracted, and intenſely fixed upon frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and often upon very improper and pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous objects and narrations. Whereby the worſt of impreſſions and principles are frequently rivet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their young and tender minds: And their lively imaginations, fired with premature ideas, and falſe notions of men and things: Therefore may it be truly ſaid.—"Bad Books are a public fountain of vice."</p>
               <p>SCRIPTURE informs us, the Apoſtle Paul wrought ſo great a conviction, at a certain time, on the minds of the Epheſians; That many of them, "which uſed curious arts brought their books together, and burned them before all men: and they counted the price of them and found it fifty thouſand pieces of ſilver."<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts, xix. 19.</note>
               </p>
               <p>IF all the vain, wicked and unprofitable books in this city, were collected into one place, the bulk would doubtleſs be aſtoniſhingly great, could all their pernicious contents be ſeen at once, no mind not callous to the feelings of virtue; but would be filled with horror:—But ah! could all their fatal effects; as diſobedience to parents—

debaucheries—proſtitutions—broken promiſes— perjuries—adulteries—ſuicides and other crimes too horrid to name, and all the ſouls eventually loſt, cauſed by learning in, and inculcated from this abominable library of hell, be fully known:— not an arm, in the city, would remain a moment unſtretched to light the funeral pile of departing vice: And the curling clouds of the riſing co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns of ſmoke would aſcend towards heaven, as an acceptable ſin offering from the inhabitants of Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>IF prudent parents are cautious (as they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ought to be) in reſpect of what, company they admit in their families, as intimate acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances:—how much more caution is, neceſſary with regard to books?</p>
               <p>IN converſation many circumſtances ſerve to repreſs and abaſh vicious diſpoſitions and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. In reading none. The moſt pernicious books are generally read with the greateſt ſecreſy: not a bluſh raiſed at any impropriety of expreſſion: nor perhaps a thought excited, or alarmed with a ſenſe of danger; while the moſt intimate and deſtructive connections are forming by means of books: between wicked and deſigning authors; and innocent and unſuſpecting youth.</p>
               <p>Is it not an incumbent duty upon every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; capable of ſerious reflection, to inſpect their own books; and thoſe of their dependants: and to burn and entirely deſtroy all ſuch as tend to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt

good morals: and to lead the mind aſtray from the paths of innocence, rectitude, and virtue: and to ſuffer, upon no pretence whatever, any book to remain, or, ever after to be introduced, that may be found inconſiſtent with the pureſt morals, and the ſtricteſt reformation; that now ſeems ſo evidently neceſſary to take place?</p>
               <p>REMEMBER I beſeech you, how, that in Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua's time, the ſecreting a wedge of gold, ſome ſilver, and a Babyloniſh garment; brought trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble upon the children of Iſrael; and proved the entire deſtruction of one of its families.</p>
               <p>OH! that one and all of us, may be induced from the beſt of motives, to unite in ſo laudable an undertaking, as that of effectually clearing this city of bad books; if rightly undertaken, God will no doubt, in mercy to the riſing generation, crown every honeſt effort with deſired ſucceſs.</p>

               <p>THE mind of man, ever active in the purſuit of happineſs, when diſappointed in one object, naturally turns to another; as ſaith an eminent poet:</p>

               <p>FROM a feeling of the judgments of God—from an experience of the vanity of the world, its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency to beſtow laſting happineſs—from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the dignity of virtue, and ſeeing the good man happy in every ſituation—many are at times brought into a ſtate of inward attention and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, which, if abode in, with patience and perſeverance, would be the means, by the bleſſing of God, of bringing thoſe, who are thus exerciſed, out of darkneſs into light; out of anxiety and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, into peace, and a well grounded hope of future happineſs.</p>
               <p>IF unbelievers can receive inſtruction from the examples of good men, in their lives, they may not be altogether unbenefited by attending to their deaths.</p>
               <p>IT is the end that crowns all; and where a man is ſeen calmly quiting every earthly connection— paſſing the verge of time—entering on the borders of eternity—ſatisfied with life—unmoved at death! it appears to all a conſummation devoutly to be wiſhed; and many are ready to adopt the langu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Balaam, "Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my laſt end be like his!"<note n="*" place="bottom">Numb. xxiii. 10.</note>

               <p>WE frequently ſee and hear that the rulers of the earth, when their ambaſſadors, their envoys extraordinary, their ſubjects or citizens, are treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with abuſe, contempt, or neglect, in a foreign land, denounce the vengeance of the ſtate, unleſs reparation for the offence is made. An inſult to an individual is often viewed as offered immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the majeſty of the nation: War ſometimes enſues, and thouſands, comprehending the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and guilty, are often involved in one undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed ruin.</p>
               <p>IF earthly potentates are ſo jealous of matters concerning honour and reſpect, whether relating immediately to themſelves, or thoſe under their direction and government, can we ſuppoſe the ſupreme ruler of the univerſe, poſſeſſing all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and power, to be an idle ſpectator, and wholly indifferent about the manner in which his meſſengers are received—his ſervants treated— and his communications attended to and obeyed?</p>
               <p>MOST individuals and moſt communities have a day; wherein happineſs, in its moſt extenſive ſenſe, may be obtained. Adam had a day—but not being ſufficiently attentive he ſuffered loſs.— The old world, had their day, but they neglected it:—Among them, was Noah, a preacher of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, but he was diſregarded; they were too
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:033464_0055_0FF7417800566918"/>
much immerſed in temporal concerns; the earth was filled with violence: all fleſh had corrupted his way—and deſtruction enſued. And although the Almighty covenanted with Noah and his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that ſo univerſal a deſtruction among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, by reaſon of a flood ſhould not again take place: yet we have ſeen, and this day feel, that the Lord's arm is not ſhortened, either to ſave or deſtroy.</p>
               <p>SODOM and Gomorrha had a day, but alas! it was neglected; till deſtruction came: though they had a Lot in the city to warn and reprove; and an Abraham in the country to intercede with Heaven. Oh how many reproving Lots, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceding Abrahams, have, day and night, in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and out of ſeaſon, been employed for the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of this city. Some of whom have been mocked and deſpiſed—pointed and jeered at, when walking the ſtreets —and, all in effect have been but too much diſregarded until calamity approached.</p>
               <p>AHAB had a day, and although a very wicked King, ſurrounded by an idolatrous people—and his public and private concerns troubled with a cruel, meddleſome, unprincipalled woman: which ſtirred him up to do, what perhaps otherwiſe would not have been done: Yet when the Lord reproved him by the mouth of his prophet, he did not mock at religion, nor deſpiſe his meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; (though he counted him for an enemy) but
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:033464_0056_0FF7415115F72B40"/>
he humbled himſelf before God, and his doom was ſuſpended.</p>
               <p>THE inhabitants of Ninevah had a day of g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ace aſſigned unto them: and by attending thereto in earneſt—by an univerſal humiliation—fervent prayer to Almighty God—and a thorough repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and reformation—the anger of the moſt high was appeaſed—and his righteous judgments not inflicted.</p>
               <p>THE Jews had a day, a long day of grace, but they never fully improved it. They were divided into different ſects; ſome Phariſees; ſome Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees; others perhaps, of no particular denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but mockers at any appearanc of religion. Moſt were too much outward in their perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances, and few ſincere at heart in the ſight of God: They, as a city, as a nation, withſtood the law and the prophets: the Son and ſent of God, came perſonally unto them; but they received him not: they mocked and perſecuted both him and the religion he came to eſtabliſh; which brought upon them and their city, a deſtruction attended with circumſtances unparralleled in hiſtory, anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent or modern, ſacred or profane.</p>
               <p>A PROSPECT of which, brought from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſionate and ever bleſſed Son of God and ſaviour of the world, that pathetic exclamation and dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful denunciation, "Oh, Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, thou that killeſt the prophets, and ſtoneſt them which are ſent unto thee, how often would I

               <p>MAY God of his infinite mercy, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord and Saviour, grant that theſe things may be received in the love of the truth: That all, who have heretofore been mockers of religion, may be convinced of their folly and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and turn from their evil ways; leſt they ſhould experience from God, what is ſpoken of by the wiſe man Solomon, "Becauſe I have call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ye have refuſed; I have ſtretched out my hand, and no man regardeth; but ye have ſet at nought all my counſel, and would none of my reproof; I alſo will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh.

               <p>JUDGMENTS are ſometimes varied according to the ſins and circumſtances of thoſe upon whom they are inflicted.

               <p>BUT the inhabitants of this city, are many of them peaceable men; profeſſing to ſtand aloof from war, and being concerned in the deſtruction
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:033464_0062_0FF680724E5A7BF8"/>
of their fellow men:—pacific principles, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their advocates intermixing with their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens, upon many local intereſting occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and thereby in conjunction with the great diffuſion of knowledge, and the improved civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation of the preſent day have inſenſibly infuſed general principles of peace, with ſome exceptions, into the maſs of ſociety. The citizens, therefore, ſpeaking in general terms; may be called pacific in many of their principles, and moſt of their practices; their ſins may be conſidered, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted more directly againſt God, and their own ſouls and bodies; than againſt the lives and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of their neighbours.</p>
               <p>THE puniſhment therefore of theſe tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſeem to proceed directly from God, and to be confined in a manner to the city: with a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py tendency when improved aright, to enforce the obſervance of thoſe duties, which have been neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, and the practice of thoſe virtues, that ſtand oppoſed to the ſins and vices, which have been moſt prevalent.</p>

               <p>WHICH voice that we may all hear, and ſo obey; as to live in truth and peace before him— may God of his infinite mercy grant, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord! AMEN.</p>

               <p>EMBRACING, in the arms of faith and love, every individual inhabitant of this extenſive city, and humbly proſtrating before the throne of divine grace, with the deepeſt awe, and moſt profound veneration, my ſoul breathes forth fervent ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to the moſt high! that he would graciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be pleaſed, to enable us all to examine our ways and doings, and in the goodneſs and abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his infinite mercy, for the ſake of his dear Son our bleſſed ſaviour and redeemer, aſſiſt us in every needful time, to repent and reform of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we have done amiſs; that ſo, we may be received into his favour, and all tokens of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, in future, be averted; and the proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and happineſs of this our beloved city, be placed and ſecured upon that only ſure foundation, acceptance with God, through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
