            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>Firſt LETTER.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>My dear Friend,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I Received a Letter from thee the Week before laſt, which was ſent by thy Uncle <hi>Bolton:</hi> There were a great many kind Expreſſions in it, and in thy Siſter <hi>Clopton's</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. I acknowledge my ſelf much obliged to you both, and to the whole Family, for many repeated Kindneſſes, and if my School had not engroſſed ſo much of my Time, I would have taken Opportunity to anſwer my dear Friend's Letter e're now, and upon that Account my Delay will be the more excuſable,</p>
               <p>The News thou haſt heard of my late Change, is really true, I cannot conceal it, for it is what I glory in; neither was it any Proſpect of temporal Advantage that induced me to it, but a ſincere Love to the Truth, and pure Regard to my own Soul: Neither can I be ſufficiently thankful to God, that he hath let me live to this glorious Day, and not cut me off in the Midſt of my Sins and Provocations againſt Him; He is long-ſuffering to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance: He hath brought me off from the Forms and Shadows of Religion, and let me ſee in a more illuſtrious Manner what is the Life and Subſtance of it, as he found me in ſome Degree faithful to that Meaſure of Light and Knowledge he hath beſtowed on me, whilſt I was in the Communion of the <hi>Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland;</hi> therefore he was pleaſed of late, as I humbly waited upon him, to make known to me greater and deeper Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his Kingdom: And I can truly ſay, that I find by daily Experience, as I keep low and retired into that pure Gift which he hath planted within me, Things are every Day more and more cleared up to me, and the Truth ſhines and prevails greatly over the Kingdom of Darkneſs; And if I ſhould now turn my Back upon ſuch Manifeſtations as theſe, and entangle myſelf again with the Yoke of Bondage, ſurely I ſhould grieve the Holy Spirit: So that he might juſtly withdraw his kind Operations, and never return more to aſſiſt and comfort me: For God is not mocked; Religion is a very ſerious and weighty Thing; Repentance

and Salvation are not to be trifled with, nor is turing to God to be put off till our own Time, Leiſure or Conveniency, but we muſt love and cheriſh the leaſt Appearance of Chriſt, not ſlighting or deſpiſing the Day of ſmall Things, but em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the firſt Opportunity of following Chriſt in any of his Commands: When he ſpeaks, there is ſuch Force and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in it that we cannot ſtend to cavil, diſpute, or ask Queſtions; for unleſs we will be ſo obſtinate as to ſhut our Eyes againſt the Sun, we muſt needs confeſs to the Truth of his Doctrine, and preſently ſtrike in with it. And therefore, when for ſeveral Weeks I had lived more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately and retiredly in <hi>London</hi> than was uſual, Faſting twice or thrice in a Week, or ſometimes more, ſpending my Time in reading the Scriptures and in Prayer to God, this was a good Preparation of my Mind to receive the Truth which he was then about to make known to me: I lamented the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of my paſt Life, and was deſirous to attain a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Degree of Holineſs than I had diſcovered in the <hi>Church of England.</hi> In this religious Retirement God knew the Breathings of my Soul, how ſincere I was, and reſigned to him when alone; I wanted him to ſet me free, and to ſpeak Peace and Comfort to my Soul, which was grieved and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the Burthen of Sin: For tho' I had ſtrictly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed myſelf to the Orders and Ceremonies of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and had kept myſelf from running into any great or ſcandalous Enormities, the Fear of the Almighty preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me; yet ſtill I had not that Reſt and Satisfaction in myſelf which I deſired and greatly longed for; I found, when I had examined my State and Condition to God ward, that Things were not right with me.</p>
               <p>As for a ſober and plauſable Converſation in the Eye of the World, I know that was a very eaſy Attainment; a good natural Temper, with the Advantage of a liberal Education, will quickly furniſh a Man with Abilities for that, ſo that he ſhall be looked upon as a Saint, and very ſpiritual, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in Chains of Darkneſs, in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and in the very Bond of Iniquity. If this Sort of Righteouſneſs would have done, perhaps I might make as fair Pretenſions that Way as ſome others: But, alas! I ſoon ſaw the Empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Unſatisfactorineſs of thoſe Things: This is a Cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that will not protect or hide us from the Wrath of the Almighty, when he comes to Judgment: 'Tis not a Man's
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009098_0004_1031060CCC6AE4E0"/>
natural Temper, nor his Education, that makes him a good Chriſtian; this is not the Righteouſneſs which the Goſpel calls for; nor is this Truth in the inward Parts, which God requires: The Heart and Affections muſt be cleanſed and purified before we can be acceptable to God; therefore it was Death to me to think of taking up my Reſt in a formal Pretence of Holineſs; wherein, yet, I ſaw, to my Grief, Abundance of People wrap'd themſelves; ſlept ſecurely and quietly, dreaming of the Felicity of Paradiſe, as if Heaven were now their own, and they needed not trouble themſelves any more about Religion: I could not entertain ſo dangerous an Opinion as this, for then I ſhould be tempted to take up my Reſt by the Way, whilſt I was travelling towards the promiſed Land. I think I made a little Progreſs in a holy Life, and through God's Aſſiſtance I awakened ſome of my ſpiritual Enemies whilſt I lived in the Communion of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church. I thank my God, I can truly ſay, whilſt I uſed thoſe Prayers I did it with Zeal and Sincerity, in his Fear and Dread; but ſtill, I ceaſed not my earneſt Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him in private, that he would ſhew me ſomething more excellent, that I might get a compleat Victory over all my Luſts and Paſſions, and might perfect Righteouſneſs before him; for I found a great many Sins and Weakneſſes daily attending me: And tho' I made frequent Reſolutions to forſake thoſe Sins, yet ſtill the Temptation was too ſtrong for me, ſo that often I had Cauſe to complain with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, in the Bitterneſs of my Soul, <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this Death!</hi> Who ſhall ſet me free, and give me Strength to triumph over Sin, the World and the Devil? That I may in every Thing pleaſe God, and there may not be the leaſt Thought, Word or Motion, Geſture or Action, but what is exactly agreeable to his moſt holy Will, as if I ſaw him ſtanding before me, and as if I were to be judged by him for the Thoughts of my Heart next Moment. O divine Life! O ſeraphick Soul! O that I could always ſtand here for here is no Reflection, no Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, no Repentance! but at God's right Hand there is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Peace, and a River of unſpeakable Joy. O that we might imitate the Life of Jeſus, and be throughly furniſhed unto every good Word and Work! This was the frequent Breathing of my Soul to God when I was in the Country,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:009098_0005_1031060FF632BD98"/>
but more eſpecially after I had left my new Preferment of a Chaplain, and took private Lodgings in <hi>London:</hi> In this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement I hope I may ſay, without Boaſting, that I was very devout and religious, and I found great Comfort and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment in it from the Lord, who let me ſee the Beauty of Holineſs; and the Sweetneſs that ariſes from an humbled mortified Life was then very pleaſant to my Taſte, and I rejoiced in it more than in all the Delights and Pleaſures of the World.</p>
               <p>And now it pleaſed God to ſhew me, that if I would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed live ſtrictly and holily as becomes the Goſpel, then I muſt leave the Communion of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but knew not yet which Way to determine myſelf, nor to what Body of Men I ſhould join, who were more orthodox, and more regular in their Lives. As for the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called, I was ſo great a Stranger to them, that I had never read any of their Books, nor do I remember, that ever I converſed with any one Man of that Communion in my whole Life: I think there was one in <hi>Foxly</hi> while I was a Curate there, but I never ſaw the Man, tho' I went ſeveral Times to his Houſe on Purpoſe to talk with him, and to bring him off from his wild and mad Enthuſiaſm, as I then ignorantly thought it to be: As for that Way, I know it was every where ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt; he that had a Mind to appear more witty and inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious than the reſt, would chuſe this for the Subject of his profane Jeſts and Drollery; with this he makes Sport, and diverts the Company; for a <hi>Quaker</hi> is but another Name for a Fool or a Mad-man, and was ſcarce ever mention'd but with Scorn and Contempt. As for Drollery, I confeſs I was never any great Friend to it; but indeed if all was true that was laid to the <hi>Quaker's</hi> Charge. I thought that they were ſome of the worſt People that ever appeared in the World, and wonder'd with what Face they could call themſelves Chriſtians, ſince I was told they denied the fundamental Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the holy Faith, to which I ever bore the higheſt Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration and Eſteem; and notwithſtanding I had always lived at the greateſt Diſtance from that People, and was very zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in the Worſhip of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and upon all Occaſions would ſpeak very honourably of it, moreover was content to ſuffer ſome few Inconveniencies upon that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, (as thou very well knoweſt) yet my Father ſtill look'd
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009098_0006_10310614C44381C8"/>
upon me as inclining to the <hi>Quakers;</hi> and ſome Years ago ſignified to a Friend, he was afraid I would become an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſt; and whilſt I was at <hi>Bungan</hi> School he ſent me two Books to read that were writ againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> one of which was <hi>John Faldo's,</hi> who hath been ſufficiently expoſed for it by <hi>William Penn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt I lived in <hi>London</hi> in that private retired Manner (I was juſt now ſpeaking of) walking very humbly in the Sight of God, and having Opportunity to reflect upon my paſt Life, as I had Occaſion to be one Day at a Book-ſeller's Shop. I happened to caſt my Eye on <hi>Barclay's</hi> Works; and having heard in the Country, that he was a Man of great Account among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> I had a Mind to ſee what their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were, and what Defence they could make for themſelves; for ſure, tho't I, theſe People are not ſo ſilly and ridiculous, nor Maintainers of ſuch horrid Opinions, as the Authors of the <hi>Snake,</hi> and ſome others, would make us believe. I took <hi>Barclay</hi> home with me, and I read him through in a Week's Time, ſave a little Treatiſe at the End, which I found to be very philoſophical, I omitted; but however, I ſoon read enough to convince me of my own Blindneſs and Ignorance in the Things of God; there I found a Light to break in upon my Mind, which did mightily refreſh and comfort me in that poor, low, and humble State in which I then was; for indeed I was then, and had been ſo for a conſiderable Time before, very hungry and thirſty after Righteouſneſs, and therefore I received the Truth with all Readineſs of Mind; 'twas like Balm to my Soul, and as Showers of Rain to the thirſty Earth which is parched with Heat and Drought.</p>
               <p>This Author laid Things down ſo plainly, and proved them with ſuch Ingenuity and Dexterity of Learning, and opened the Scriptures ſo clearly to me, that without ſtanding to cavil diſpute, raiſe Argument or Objection, or conſulting with Fleſh and Blood, I preſently reſigned my ſelf to God, and weeping for Joy that I had found ſo great a Treaſure, I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten thanked him with Tears in my Eyes for ſo kind a Viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Love, that he was graciouſly pleaſed to look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward me when my Soul cried after him; ſo, that tho' be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was in great Doubt and Trouble of Mind, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which Way to determine my ſelf, yet now the Sun breaking out ſo powerfully upon me, the Clouds were ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered:
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009098_0007_10310617EDDF7820"/>
I was now fully ſatisfied in my own Mind which Way I ought to go, and to what Body of People I ſhould join my ſelf. So I immediately left the Communion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> and went to <hi>Gracious-Street</hi> Meeting. After I had read <hi>Barclay,</hi> I read ſome other Books of that Kind, among which was an excellent Piece, tho' in a ſmall Volume, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>No Croſs, No Crown:</hi> Thus I continued reading and frequenting Meetings for ſeveral Weeks together, but did not let any one Soul know what I was about: The firſt Man I converſed with was <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> and this was ſeveral Weeks after I began to read <hi>Barclay,</hi> and frequent their Meetings: By him I was introduced into more Acquaintance, and ſtill the farther I went the more I liked their Plainneſs, and the Decency and Simplicity of their Converſation: They do not uſe the Ceremonies and Salutations of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but ſhake Hands freely and converſe together as Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Siſters that are ſprung of the ſame Royal Seed, and made Kings and Prieſts unto God. O, the Love, the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Tenderneſs of Affection I have ſeen among this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple! <hi>By this,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>ſhall all Men know that ye are my Diſciples, if ye have Love one to another.</hi> John xiii, 35. <hi>Put on therefore,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>(as the Elect of God holy and beloved) Bowels of Mercies, Kindneſs, Humbleneſs of Mind, Meekneſs, Long-ſuffering.</hi> Col. iii. 12.</p>
               <p>Thus, my dear Friend, I have given thee an Account of my Proceedings on this Affair. As to my bodily State, if thou deſireſt to know what it is, I may acquaint thee that I have my Health as well as ever, and I bleſs God I have Food and Raiment ſufficient for me, ſo that I want no outward Thing; and I have the Neceſſities and Conveniencies of Life liberally. Let us not burthen our ſelves with taking Care for the Vanities and Superfluities of it; let us <hi>poſſeſs our Veſſels in Sanctification and Honour.</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> iv. 4. And as we bring our Minds into perfect Subjection to the whole Will of God, ſo let us bring our Body to the moſt ſimple and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Way of living, being content with the feweſt Things, never ſtudying to gratify our wanton Appetites, nor to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Cuſtoms and Honours of Men, but how we may ſo contract our earthly Cares and Pleaſures, that we may bring moſt Glory to God, moſt Health and Peace to our own Souls, and do moſt Service to the Truth; and if this be our Aim,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009098_0008_10310619A7080CD8"/>
certainly a very ſmall Portion of the Things of this World will ſuffice us: Seeing we are Chriſtians, we ſhould there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore earneſtly purſue thoſe Things which bring us neareſt to God, and which are moſt perfective of humane Nature; for what is more than a Competency ſeems to be a Burden to a generous philoſophical Soul, which would breath in a pure Vehicle, that ſo it may have a quick Senſe and Reliſh of all Bleſſings, both of the ſuperior and inferior Worlds.</p>
               <p>Thou knoweſt, my dear Friend, that Religion is a very ſerious Thing, and Repentance is a great Work, and one precious immortal Soul is of more Worth, than ten thouſand periſhing Worlds, with all their Pomp and Glory: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us take Courage, and be valiant for the Truth upon the Earth, let us not content our ſelves with a Name and Profeſſion of Godlineſs, let us come to the Life and Power of it; let us not deſpond of getting the Victory; we have a little Strength for God; let us be faithful to him and he will give us more Strength, ſo that we ſhall ſee the Enemy of our Peace fall before us, and nothing ſhall be impoſſible unto us: I ſay, my Friend, let us be faithful to that Meaſure of Light and Knowledge which God has given us, to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited and edified by it in a ſpiritual Life, and as God ſees we are diligent and faithful to work with the Strength we have, he will more and more enlighten us, ſo that we ſhall ſee to the End of thoſe Forms and Shadows of Religion wherein we have formerly lived; but if he ſees we are about to take up our Reſt in thoſe Shadows, that we grow cold and indifferent in the Purſuit of Holineſs, running out into Notions and Speculations, and have more Mind to diſpute, and to make a Shew of Learning and Subtility, than to lead a holy and devout Life, then 'tis juſt with God to leave us in a carnal and polluted State, to continue yet but in the outward Court, where we may pleaſe our ſelves with beholding the Beauty and Ornaments of a worldly Sanctuary, and never witneſs the Vail being taken away, and that we are brought by the Blood of Jeſus into the Holieſt of all, where alone there is true Peace with God, and Reſt to the weary Soul. I could ſay much more upon this Head if Time or Leiſure would give Leave.</p>
               <p>As for a particular Anſwer to thy Letter, I have not Time now to give it; and for the preſent let this general Anſwer

ſuffice: And if thou wilt conſider Things in their pure ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted Nature, and not ſuffer the Prejudice of Education to ſway thee, but in Fear and Humility wilt ſearch out the Truth for thy ſelf, thou wilt find that there needs no other Anſwer to thy Letter than what I have already given; for by waiting on God, and diligently ſeeking him, thou wilt find Anſwer to it in thy own Boſom, and this will be much more full, clear, and ſatisfactory than I, or any other Man living can pretend to give thee, or any other Friend who hath lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly wrote to me, for whom I deſire, with all the ſincere-hearted in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that they may come to witneſs the Almighty Power of God, to ſave and redeem them from every Yoke; and that they may ſee clearly to the End of thoſe Things which are aboliſhed, and come to the Enjoyment of ſpiritual and heavenly Things themſelves, is the daily Prayer and deep Travil of my Soul, God knoweth. 'Till I can be more particular, if thou pleaſe thou may'ſt communicate this to them, and let them know that I am well, and thank them for their kind Letters. Let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to pray for one another with all Fervency, that we may ſtand perfect in the whole Will of God, <hi>Amen,</hi> ſaith my Soul.

               <p>I Lately received a kind and brotherly Letter from thee, for which I return thee many Thanks. I am now in the Communion of the People called <hi>Quakers;</hi> and I have Cauſe to bleſs God for this happy Change of my Life: I am thro' Mercy brought off from the Shadow of Religion, and am preſſing forwards to get Acquaintance with the quickening Power, Life and Virtue of it, if that I may be a Chriſtian indeed, and not in Name and Profeſſion only. I had a great while talk'd and diſcours'd of Holineſs, but did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what it was to talk with God, to live and dwell in him.

Perhaps indeed ſome may think I made a fair Shew of Piety when I was with you. But alas! I was deeply ſenſible of my own Faults and Miſcarriages and I reſolved thro' God's Aſſiſtance to enquire after ſomething more Noble and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than I had diſcovered in that State; and bleſſed be his Name for ever, that God hath anſwered the Cry of my Soul, and let me ſee a People that are hated and deſpiſed by the World, but are dear to him; for he hath revealed to them the Myſteries of the Kingdom; he hath carried them upon Eagles Wings, and cheriſhed them as the Apple of his Eye. As for me, I have been yet but in the outward Court; and far ſhort of that Truth and Righteouſneſs that is taught and practiſed among this People: For they are come within the Holieſt of all; they are come into a near Communion with God, to behold the Cherubims of Glory that cover the Mercy-Seat, to be fed with the true Manna. Theſe are Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries that are to be revealed unto the Meek and Lowly, but the Haughty, Inſolent and Profane, cannot come, near them, nor taſte of the Sweetneſs nor Comfort of them. Indeed the formal traditional ſort of People of the World, may talk of theſe Things as they have heard from others, and in their ſober Minntes may have ſome faint Glimmerings that Way; but to come to a real and inward Enjoyment of them, they can no more pretend to, than to work the greateſt impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities; all their Wit, and Subtility, and Learning, cannot reach higher for to handle of the Word of Life; this is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar only to thoſe who are content to forſake all, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Fools for Chriſt, they are thoſe who are in a good Temper to receive and co-operate with the Influence of the Holy Spirit, and have ſeen the Emptineſs and Vanity of all thoſe Things that are ſo much admired by the World; the Schools, and Univerſities, and Learned Doctors, and Great Rabbies, have not profitted me; they are ravened from the Spirit of God, and gone out into their own Notions and Speculations, thinking thereby to ſearch out God and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Truth. Alas! the Myſteries of God's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom are far out of their Reach in their carnal Minds; they weary themſelves in vain; the Vulture's Eye cannot pierce into theſe Secrets; all the great Critick Scholars and Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers of the World are Fools in theſe Things, and which they are wearying themſelves to find the deep Things of our

God, ſtudying and racking their Heads, toſſing and tumbling to and fro like a wild Bull in a Net, and knows not which Way to diſentangle himſelf; the more he ſtruggles, the weaker he grows, the faſter he is bound; ſo the more theſe vain Talkers read, the more they write; the more they cavil and diſpute, the further they are from God, and the more they declare their Hatred and Enmity to the Spirit of Chriſt, and to the Simplicity of the Goſpel. I have been a long Time a weary of the Folly and Impertinency of theſe Men, and chiefly the celebrated Fathers of the Church, as they call them; the Councils and Synods of Old, are now of very ſmall Account with me; I am not aſhamed to ſit under the Teachings of Women and Mechanicks, howſoever they may ſeem in the Eye of the World; for they teach me more Chriſtianity, and inſtruct me more perfectly in a divine Life, than all the ſtudied elaborated Sermons and Diſcourſes that ever I heard at the Univerſities, or ſince; their Words are with Power, they are mightily aſſiſted with the Spirit of God, they ſpeak with Majeſty and Authority, and there is a native Beauty, Clearneſs and Solidity of Expreſſion, that ſhines thro' their Diſcourſes, which is ſufficient to anſwer that groundleſs Calumny, <hi>viz. The Quakers Preaching is Nonſenſe, and no Body could underſtand them.</hi> This I have heard often refuted by many living Teſtimonies, ſo that I do rather think them the beſt Wits, and the moſt ingenious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the World; for they employ their Parts and Learning in the Fear of God to his Glory and Service, and to promote the trueſt Intereſt of Mankind. As for the little Jeſts, Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſes, and vain Pedantry of the Age, which I know the World hath Eſteem for, and nothing will pleaſe but what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with ſuch Fooleries. I ſay, if the <hi>Quakers</hi> be defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in any of theſe, it is not for want of Abilities, or becauſe they have leſs Wit than other Men, but becauſe they have more Prudence and Wiſdom to govern it, and that is the Reaſon why they avoid ſuch childiſh Vanities, which are ſo freely uſed and indulged by others, to the great Diſhonour of God and the Chriſtian Religion; and therefore becauſe they do not ſeek to pleaſe a wanton Age, to make People laugh and be merry, nor to entertain that carnal airy Mind with pleaſant Stories, fine Notions and witty Expreſſions of natural Things; from thence it is that they have been ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully traduced by the World, as the moſt ignorant, blind

and fooliſh People that ever made any Profeſſion or Religion, and yet this is the People to whom I have now joined my ſelf in a ſincere Love to Truth, God knoweth; and I glory more in this Fellowſhip and Acquaintance with theſe Lambs of Chriſt, than if I were related to the greateſt Kings, Lords and Potentates upon the Earth. Oftentimes hath my Spirit been refreſhed with theirs, when we have met together to wait upon God; and my Soul ſtill longs and pants more and more to be filled with theſe divine Comforts: he is ready al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to pour down Bleſſings upon us, if we could qualify ourſelves for the Reception of them; if we would put away vain Thoughts, which cloud and darken the Mind, and ſo hinders the favourable Influence and Iradations of Heaven.</p>
               <p>And ſince it hath pleaſed God to viſit me of late, and to make known to me excellent Things in Righteouſneſs, he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is to have the Praiſe and Glory of all, and now I freely reſign myſelf to the Conduct of the bleſſed Spirit; now let the Truth proſper, now let it run and he glorified in the Earth, let it ſhine out in its full Luſture, to the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and Confuſion of all the Enemies thereof, and to the reviving of the Souls of the Hungry and Thirſty, who are ready to faint, waiting for and expecting the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> until the Times of Refreſhment comes from the Preſence of the Lord, who will open a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain for <hi>Judab</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſo that Rivers ſhall run in dry Places: There will he ſpeak Peace to his People, and after they have ſat ſilent a little While in the Duſt, ſuffering pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently the chaſtizing Rod of his Love to paſs over them, he ſhall then comfort the Daughter of <hi>Sion,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Ariſe thou afflicted, and weep and mourn no more, but put on thy beautiful Garments.</hi> Oh! <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> raiſe thy Head, uncover thy Face, and gird up thy Loins with Strength, ſee the Day break, and the Morning ſpread it ſelf upon the Mountains; now the ſorrowful Nights of Affliction are gone over, the Clouds are ſcatter'd and gone, the Sun is riſen in its Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and now Joy and Peace ſhall be multiplied; in a little Wrath I hid my Face from thee for a Moment, but with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Kindneſs will I have Mercy on thee, ſaith the Lord thy Redeemer. Oh! let us wait in Humility of Soul, and Tenderneſs of Heart, before the Lord, that we may witneſs this great Change and Salvation wrought in us and for us,

that the Scripture may be no more a ſealed Book to us, but that we may feel the precious Truths therein recorded to be fulfilled, in our own Particulars. Then there we ſhall never be weary of praying, and reading the holy Scriptures; we ſhall never be loath or unwilling to come into God's Preſence; for his Love, and the Sweetneſs of his Ointment, will draw and allure us to dwell always under his Canopy, that we may feel Life and Power to flow from Him who is the Ocean that ſupplies all the Wants of the Children of Men; and how ſhall we come to taſte of that heavenly Banquet he hath prepared for us, that we may eat and drink at his Table, and that our Souls may delight in Fatneſs? I ſay, how ſhall we attain to this, but by a ſtrict and mortified Life? Certainly the more we retire from worldly Joys, and empty our ſelves of earthly Comforts and falſe Delights, the fitter we ſhall be to receive thoſe that are ſpiritual and heavenly; and not only to receive and rejoice in them for a Time, but to live and dwell in them for ever, for this is the Life of Jeſus; and here the Kingdom of God reigns in the Heart and Soul, by which it is changed from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. And now I would aſk all the wife and prudent, all the rich, all the noble and learned Men of the World, what they think of theſe Things: Whether this is to be learned in their Courts and Palaces? Or whether any of the great Scholars and Univerſities in Chriſtendom can furniſh us with ſuch a Syſtem of Divinity as this? No, they hate it, and deſpiſe it, and inſtead of a ſober Anſwer to my Query, they return Scoffs and Contempt. This is Canting they ſay, and an idle Dream, and forged Chimera of my own Brain, and a great many more opprobrious Names they have for ſuch Enquiries as theſe. Sometimes, perhaps, they will ſuffer the Expreſſion, with an hypocritical Shew, will pretend to pity me, calling it an unhappy Effect of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly, and too much Retirement from the World; and this they think too much Condeſenſion, that I ought to think my ſelf beholding to them for giving it ſo mild a Character; for at other Times they deal more ſharply, and ſay confidently that it is Madneſs, Deluſion, Witchcraft, and diabolical En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm.</p>
               <p>But I am content to lie under all theſe odious Imputation from the World, knowing very well that better Men than I have ſuffer'd the ſame things before me, and do, at this preſent

Time. As for my Enemies, I can truly ſay, I thank God I pity them, and pray for them; they do not hurt me, but themſelves. And now, my dear Friend, before I conclude, ſuffer me a little to ſpeak of thy preſent Circumſtances; for, as God knoweth, my Bowels yearns towards thee in the tender Love of Jeſus, I ſuppoſe thou art now where I left thee, <hi>viz.</hi> with the Lord <hi>Richardſon,</hi> ſo called, in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of a Chaplain, an Office which I have had a little Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of my ſelf, ſince I laſt ſaw thee; but was quickly ſo weary of that ſervile Yoke, ſo unworthy of that holy Function I bore, that in ten Days Time I quitted my new Preferment, and left it more freely than ever I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook it. What Peace or Satisfaction thou canſt have in ſuch Employment I know not; for my Part, I could find none; my Soul was grieved and burthen'd every Day with ſeeing and hearing their evil Deeds, beholding their Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Exceſſes; this was a Sword to my Soul and Spirit, it wounded me very deep; and I do ſolemnly profeſs, I had rather beg my Bread from Door to Door, than to live in the like Bondage again, where I muſt be obliged to ſuch Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies and Formalities, to flatter Men in their Sins, to cry Peace, Peace; and to ſow Pillows under the Arm-holes of delicate People, that can never bear the leaſt Check or Frown, but expect the mercenary Prieſt ſhould always laugh or ſmile in their Faces, even when he ſees plainly they are going to Hell and Deſtruction; and yet I muſt tell thee, the Family I was in, was looked upon as one of the moſt ſober and regular, as the World goes now; and I muſt needs ſay, I did not leave them for any Drinking, Gaming, Swearing or Whoring that I perceived amongſt them; in all theſe filthy ſcandalous Practices, as far as I could ſee, they were blameleſs; but yet I ſaw their Hearts were not right; for they were Lovers of Pleaſures, more than Lovers of God; and thou knoweſt that he or they, let them be great or ſmall, if they live in Pleaſures, grow fat and wanton againſt Chriſt; ſuch Perſons are dead while they live: I ſay, whatever their Faith, or Principles, or Profeſſions may be, yet in Religion they are dead.</p>
               <p>I ſhall ſay no more, but haſten to a Concluſion. If thou deſire a particular Account of my Convincement, thou mayſt ſee it in a Letter which I wrote lately to <hi>Richard Lake,</hi> Junr.

Dear Friend, I have no more at preſent, but to let thee know I do moſt heartily pray for thee, that thou mayſt conſider Things without Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, and not ſuffer any of the Temptations or Allurments of the World to draw thy Mind from God, and to hinder thee in thy Purſuit of Holineſs; he that loves Father or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Brother or Siſter, or any of the Endearments of this World more than Chriſt, is not worthy of him; but if thou wilt come into Communion with Chriſt, and chiefly to follow the Guidence of his Light and Spirit, O what a bleſſed and happy Reſt ſhalt thou find to thy Soul!
