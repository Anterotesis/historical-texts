            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſt</hi> 20. About <hi>ſeven</hi> or <hi>eight Hundred</hi> of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> came to <hi>Fort-Maſſachuſetts,</hi> and laid Seige about twenty-four Hours. After which, they deſired to ſpeak with the Officer; who admitted the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger into the <hi>Fort,</hi> who ſaid in the Name of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that if they would ſurrender, they ſhould be well uſed. Our Men conſulted together, finding they had not Ammunition to ſtand them many Hours, tho' they had been ſparing in firing; and conſidering the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Sick they had in the Fort, tho't it their wiſeſt Method to make the beſt Capitulation they could: accordingly reſigned themſelves Priſoners of War into the Hands of the <hi>French;</hi> with the General's Promiſe, that none of them ſhould be given into the Hands of the <hi>Indians;</hi> and that the Sick, and ſuch as could not travel ſhould be carried. Yet notwithſtanding, He the next Day delivered one Half of our People into the Hands of the <hi>Indians;</hi> who the next Night kill'd <hi>one</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:006488_0010_10290F15D778AAC0"/>of our Men, who was ſick, rather than carry him. The <hi>French</hi> treated our Men civilly and tenderly: So alſo did the <hi>Indians</hi> thoſe with them according to their Manner. <hi>Thirty-two Men, Women</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred; many of whom died in <hi>Canada.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Reaſon of this Garriſon's being loſt, was, it's want of Ammunition; which had they been well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd with, they might have defended the <hi>Fort,</hi> and done much greater Spoil on the Enemy than they did: yet we have had Intelligence that near <hi>fifty</hi> of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were kill'd before the <hi>Fort</hi> ſurrendered.</p>
               <p>By whoſe Neglect the <hi>Fort</hi> was loſt, we know not; but it's probable had the Officer been deficient, he would have been diſgraced. But want of Ammunition was not only the Calamity of that Fort; but alſo of the greater Part of our Garriſons at that Time.</p>
               <p>There was <hi>one Man</hi> kill'd in the Fight, and many died in Priſon at <hi>Canada:</hi> Some are returned Home. And the <hi>Fort</hi> was burnt down; which it coſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince many Hundreds to re-build.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſt</hi> 25. <hi>Thirty</hi> of this Army came to <hi>Deerfield;</hi> not being ſatisfied with what was done at <hi>Fort-Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts;</hi> and fell upon ſome People in the South Part of the Meadow: They kill'd and ſcalp'd <hi>Samuel Allen, Eleazer Hawks,</hi> Jun. <hi>Oliver Amſden, Simeon Amſden,</hi> of

               <p>☞ Had there not been a continual firing in the Town from Day to Day; the People would have took the Alarm, and might have been upon the Enemy before ever they could have got out of the Meadow: Which ſhews the great Neceſſity of Order and Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline in Frontier Towns.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Summer</hi> a Proclamation was iſſued for inliſting Soliders for an Expedition againſt <hi>Canada:</hi> and a great Number freely inliſted, hoping the Time was coming, that God would deliver us out of the Hands of our Enemies in <hi>Canada:</hi> and the Soldiers eſpecially inliſted out of the Garriſons; ſome in order to be freed from the Province Service, which they were weary of; others with ſome more generous Views for the public Good: and all Endeavours to put a Check to the Fury of the Enemy were ſtopt: the whole Concern was to get ready for the expected Expedition: but how this turned out, we all know: great Numbers of Men kept in Pay and Idleneſs 'till diſbanded, to the Ruin of many of them, and the great Hurt of the Country.</p>

Capt. <hi>Stevens</hi> being there with about <hi>thirty</hi> Men, made all neceſſary Proviſion for their Defence; eſpecially by digging Trenches from under the <hi>Fort,</hi> about a Yard outwards in ſeveral Places, at ſo near a Diſtance to each other, as by throwing Water we might put out the Fire, in Caſe the Enemy by their four Wheel Carriages loaden with Faggots ſhoul'd ſet any outward Part of the Fort of Fire. They continued ſhooting, and throwing their <hi>Fire-Arrows</hi> for near two Days: and then deſired to ſpeak with the Captain, who admitted three of them into the Fort; three of our Men going out to the Enemy at the ſame Time: they demanded the Fort; &amp; promis'd our Men to carry them ſafe to <hi>Mount-Real,</hi> to their Friends, if they would ſurrender: but the Captain aſſured them he ſhould not reſign the Fort.— After which they continued firing, and made ſome Preparation to Storm the Fort, till the next Day; and then they requeſted the Captain to ſell them ſome Corn; he told them he would grant them five Buſhels of Corn for every Hoſtage they ſhould ſend into the

It is obſervable; that the Night before; this <hi>Goodale,</hi> when he met with ſome Difficulty to obtain Liberty of his Officer to

               <p>
                  <hi>March</hi> 15. The Snow being very deep, and our Men not fearing a ſmall Party of ſculking <hi>Indians,</hi> about <hi>eight</hi> of our Men went out about 60 Rods Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from Number <hi>Four</hi> to get Wood: The Enemy about <hi>ten</hi> in Number come within 30 Rods of the Fort; run to meet our Men, fired upon them, killed <hi>Charles Stevens,</hi> wounded one <hi>Andreas,</hi> and took <hi>Elea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer Prieſt</hi> Captive. Our Men not having <hi>Snow Shoes</hi> could not run out of the Path and make their Eſcape: Nor had the Men in the Garriſon <hi>Snow Shoes</hi> to purſue them, which the Enemy were informed of by the <hi>French</hi> Priſoner the Month before: For ſome of the Garriſon told him as he went along, <q>they would gladly accompany him Part of the Way, but they had neither <hi>Indian Shoes</hi> nor <hi>Snow Shoes.</hi>
                  </q> Thus poorly have our Garriſons been ſtored; whilſt many Hundred Pair of <hi>Snow Shoes</hi> lie on Spoil ſome where or other, which the Province have paid for.</p>

                  <hi>March</hi> 29. About <hi>twelve</hi> or <hi>fifteen Indians</hi> Way-laid the Scout-Path from <hi>Fort Dummer</hi> to <hi>Colerain:</hi> Lieutenant <hi>Sergeant</hi> and <hi>four</hi> more went out in this Path to get ſome Timber for Oars and Paddles: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Mile from <hi>Fort Dummer</hi> they were fired upon; <hi>Moſes Cooper</hi> was mortally Wounded the firſt Shot, and made his Eſcape to the Fort as faſt as he could; he died the next Night: Lieutenant <hi>Sergeant, his Son</hi> and <hi>Joſhua Wells</hi> engaged the Enemy, fighting on a Retreat; <hi>Wells</hi> was ſoon killed; <hi>Sergeant</hi> encouraged his Son; ſaid they ſhould have Help from the Fort: They charged many Times: <hi>Sergeant</hi> ſhouted as often as the Enemy did, and called upon them to come out
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006488_0017_10290EF614FE6B90"/>and fight boldly. Theſe <hi>two</hi> fought on a Retreat half a Mile; but Lieutenant <hi>Sergeant</hi> was killed, and <hi>his Son</hi> taken: They could not have any Help from the Fort; there being but a few Men there, and ſome of them ſick with the Meaſels, and others not having <hi>Snow-Shoes</hi> in Readineſs, could not go on the Snow.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>April</hi> 16. One <hi>Badcock</hi> was taken at <hi>Paquoig</hi> as he was at Work in his Field.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> 8. About <hi>twelve Indians</hi> lay in Ambuſh near an Houſe at <hi>South Hampton,</hi> and killed one <hi>Noah Pixley.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> 21. About <hi>thirty Indians</hi> lay in Ambuſh near <hi>Fort-Maſſachuſetts,</hi> to take our Men as they ſhould come out towards <hi>Deerfield.</hi> Serjeant <hi>Eliſha Chapin</hi> going out from <hi>Deerfield,</hi> with a Number of our Men, went ſilently along the Road, and came within a few Rods of them. One of the Enemy ſtanding up look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the Fort diſcovered them: <hi>Chapin</hi> ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they might be <hi>Stockbridge Indians,</hi> called to them: Upon which the Ambuſh jump'd up and ran: <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pin</hi> and <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> more next to him fired at them and killed <hi>one</hi> of them, and got his Scalp: They left a Gun, the moſt of their Blankets, and many other Things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> 25. Capt. <hi>Melvin</hi> with <hi>eighteen</hi> Men, who went out after the Enemy, came to the <hi>Lake</hi> a little South of <hi>Crown-Point;</hi> ſaw two Canoes about 50 or 60 Rods from the Shore, going to <hi>Crown-Point</hi> (theſe doubtleſs were the <hi>Indians</hi> who were drove from <hi>Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuck</hi> the Week before) Capt. <hi>Melvin</hi> and his Company ſhot 50 or 60 Guns: The <hi>Indians</hi> made a great La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation whilſt they were ſhooting at them: <hi>Crown-Point</hi> immediately took the Alarm; fired their Cannon: And that Night our Men perceived the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had got before them in their Way Home. Capt. <hi>Melvin</hi> took a contrary Courſe, when he come a-croſs their Track, ſo that he eſcap'd them, 'till he came on
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006488_0018_10290F21D5F27050"/>
                  <hi>Weſt-River</hi> on the 31ſt of <hi>May;</hi> they laid an Ambuſh on the Bank of the River, where they were ſatisfied Capt. <hi>Melvin</hi> would come between them and the River: Providence ſo ordered it that Capt. <hi>Melvin</hi> ſtop'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few Rods of the Muzzles of the Enemies Guns; they fired on him: Our Men jump'd up the Bank, and fired at them; ſome of our Men that were in the Rear made up the River; our Men fired ſome Time at them, and ſuppoſe they killed ſeveral of the Enemy. <hi>Six</hi> of our Men were killed, viz. <hi>Joſeph Petty, John How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, John Dod, Daniel Man, Iſaac Taylor,</hi> &amp; <hi>Samuel Severance.</hi> Capt. <hi>Melvin</hi> and his Men came in, all but <hi>Six,</hi> at different Times at <hi>Fort Dummer.</hi> This was a ſurprizing Stroke, and ſtruck a great Damp into the Spirits of our Men who had Thoughts of going into their Country; when they found how far the <hi>Indians</hi> would purſue them to get an Advantage upon them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> 16. A large Body of the Enemy Way-laid the Road between Col <hi>Hinſdell's Fort</hi> and <hi>Fort Dummer: Thirteen</hi> of our Men going from Col. <hi>Hinſdell's</hi> to <hi>Fort Dummer,</hi> were ſhot upon; <hi>three</hi> were killed on the Spot. Some Time after, the Bones of a Man were found where they lodged the firſt Night: <hi>Joſeph Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſon, Nathan French,</hi> and <hi>John Froſt</hi> were killed on the Spot. The Man that was kill'd where they Lodg'd the firſt Night is ſuppoſed to be <hi>William Bickford;</hi> the reſt were taken Captive, except <hi>three</hi> who made their Eſcape in the Fight.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> 26. As Capt. <hi>Humphrey Hobbs</hi> was paſſing with a Scout of <hi>forty</hi> Men from Number <hi>Four</hi> to <hi>Fort Shirley,</hi> they were purſued by <hi>One Hundred and fifty</hi> of the Enemy: and Weſt of <hi>Fort Dummer,</hi> as our Men ſtop'd to eat ſome Victuals, their Guards being out, and the Man ſet to watch their back Track diſcovered the Enemy, who gave the Alarm. There immediately
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006488_0019_10290EF7D17302B0"/>began a very hot Fight: The Enemy ruſhed on very violently; but our Men ſtood their Ground and gave them a warm Reception: The Fight laſted <hi>four Hours,</hi> in which Time <hi>three</hi> Men were killed, viz. <hi>Samuel Gunn, Ebenezer Mitchel</hi> &amp; <hi>Ely Scot;</hi> &amp; <hi>three</hi> very dangerouſly wounded, viz. <hi>Samuel Graves,</hi> who was ſhot in the Head, and ſome of his Brains came out; <hi>Daniel Mc'Keney</hi> had his Thigh broke; and <hi>Nathan Walker</hi> had his Arm broke, and the Bullet lodged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Bones of the Arm: <hi>Ralph Ryce</hi> was ſlightly Wounded: Capt. <hi>Hobbs</hi> ſhot the laſt Gun at the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and is ſuppoſed to have killed the <hi>chief Indian</hi> who encouraged them in the Fight. After the Enemy were drawn off, Capt. <hi>Hobbs</hi> brought off his dead and wounded Men; came about half a Mile, and buried his Dead as well as he could in the dark: The next Day he bro't his Wounded into <hi>Fort Dummer,</hi> and the next Day to <hi>Northfield.</hi> The Enemy doubtleſs loſt many; they went off without Shouting, and when ſome Captives ſaw them about a Week after, they looked very ſorrowful. This was a very manly Fight; and all will grant our Men quitted themſelves like Men, who Need not to be aſhamed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> 8. A Number of <hi>Indians</hi> came to the <hi>Upper-Aſhuelot,</hi> and kill'd eleven Cattle. About the ſame Time a <hi>Fort</hi> of ours was taken at <hi>Lunenburg; two</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier were killed; a Man &amp; Woman &amp; <hi>five</hi> Children were taken Captive, but are ſince returned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> 14. The Enemy that fought with Capt. <hi>Hobbs</hi> having been as far as <hi>Weſt River,</hi> and left Part of their Company, returned and Way-laid the Road between Col. <hi>Hinſdell's-Fort</hi> &amp; <hi>Fort-Dummer;</hi> and as <hi>ſeventeen</hi> Men were going to <hi>Fort-Dummer,</hi> were ſhot upon. Serjeant <hi>Thomas Taylor</hi> commanded the Men to fight them; but the Enemy ruſhed upon them, killed <hi>two
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:006488_0020_10290F235ED4CE98"/>Men</hi> on the Spot, and wounded <hi>two more</hi> whom they carried about a Mile and killed. The Men kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led were <hi>Joſeph Roſe, Aſael Graves,</hi> — <hi>Billings,</hi> and — <hi>Chandler: Nine</hi> were taken Priſoners, viz. Serjeant <hi>Thomas Taylor, Thomas Criſſon, John Henry,</hi> — <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, — Walker, Daniel How,</hi> Jun. — <hi>Edghill, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel Farmer,</hi> &amp; <hi>Ephraim Powers. Four</hi> eſcaped; <hi>one</hi> of whom was badly wounded, but is ſince recovered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> 23. A ſmall Party of the Enemy came to <hi>Northfield,</hi> and Way-laid the Town-Street; and as <hi>Aaron Belden</hi> was going from one Fort to another a little before Sun riſe, they ſhot him down and ſcalp'd him; and run off into the Woods before any Body was really apprized what was the Matter. <hi>Thus bold and daring had the Enemy grown, before the Ceſſation of Arms.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1. A Large Body of the Enemy came to <hi>Fort-Maſſachuſetts,</hi> and laid an Ambuſh: The Dogs made a Rout, which made the Men ſenſible that the Enemy were there. Capt. <hi>Williams</hi> and the Officers were conſulting how to go out, and come upon them in their Ambuſh; but a few Soldiers ran out without Orders near where the Dogs bark'd: The Enemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe ſome few of 'em and fir'd, which cauſed the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and his Men to ruſh out; one of the Enemy call'd to the Captain to come along: Our Men went ſo far, that the Ambuſh aroſe partly behind them near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the Fort: Our Men ſtood and fired ſeveral Times a-piece without any Thing to ſhelter them from the Bullets; and retreated firing, to the Fort: In the Fight Lieutenant <hi>Hawley</hi> was ſhot thro' the Legg, <hi>Ezekiel Wells</hi> had his Thigh broke, but is almoſt recovered; one <hi>Abbot</hi> was ſhot thro' the Body, who died in a Day or two; we have heard conſiderable Spoil was done upon the Enemy. A <hi>Ceſſation of Arms</hi> being heard of in <hi>Canada,</hi> put a ſtop to the Enemy's coming out.</p>

            <head>REMARKS. The following <hi>Remarks</hi> are eaſy and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural from the preceeding H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>y.</head>
            <p n="1">1ſt. WHAT a great Difference there is between our managing a War, and our Enemies: The moſt we do is to defend our ſelves at Home; but they are for an offenſive War. And it is true if they have any, they muſt have this; for a defenſive War they can have none with us: For not a Man of ours has ſeen a <hi>French</hi> Settlement all this War, except ſuch as were carried Captive or went with a Flagg of Truce.</p>
            <p n="2">2ndly. It is a rare thing we can obtain an <hi>Indian</hi> Scalp, let us do what Spoil we will upon them; ſo careful are they to carry off and conceal their Dead. For at <hi>Fort-Maſſachuſetts,</hi> where it is probable near <hi>ſixty</hi> have been killed, never have been found more than <hi>three Scalps;</hi> which ſhows us that our Men will not venture out after the Enemy on any Scalping Act whatſoever: Our Men will not venture their Lives and Service, on ſuch uncertain Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; if they ſhould be much greater than ever they have been. The like is demonſtrated at Number <hi>Four,</hi> where they have killed ſo many of the Enemy, never a Scalp could be recovered.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. We may obſerve, Of how much Importance the Enemy judge thoſe <hi>two Forts</hi> at Number <hi>Four</hi> and <hi>Hooſuck,</hi> to be to us, Hence their repeated Endeavours to deſtroy them; which they would not do, were they not advantageous to us, and in their Way in coming upon us.— And it ſhows how much it muſt encourage our Enemies, for us to give up either of them.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. We may obſerve, How ſafely the Enemy can draw off, when they have done Miſcief. I think but <hi>one</hi> Inſtance has there been all this War of our purſuing, and overtaking the Enemy to do any Spoil on them, and there are many Reaſons for it: One is, that no Body may move 'til an Account is ſent to the <hi>chief Colonel;</hi> and then Men muſt be muſtered, which takes ſo long a Time that there is no poſſibility of our taking them. Another Reaſon is, that we never have Men near, equipp'd to purſue them in the Woods; and when they have gone a few Miles in the Woods, they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and return Home.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:006488_0022_10290F28CE63B740"/>
5thly. It is obſervable, That the continual changing of Schemes renders all Meaſures for the War unſucceſsful. Before any one ſingle Scheme is tried, it is flung up, and nothing ever proſecuted to Advantage: There is ſcarce any one Scheme of more than <hi>ſix Months</hi> continuance.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. We may obſerve, That when the Province have voted any Number of Men for a particular Service; by that Time the Commiſſary can furniſh the Men with their Proviſions, their Time is expired; and this was the Caſe the Summer paſt: It took the greater Part of the Summer to ſupply the Garriſons with Proviſions; they were ſo ſcarce: And the <hi>Soldiers</hi> who were deſigned as Scouts towards <hi>Crown-Point,</hi> were a good Part of their Time employed in guarding Proviſions to the <hi>Forts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7thly. It is obſervable to all who know the State of theſe Fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, That there is not due Proviſion made to furniſh Men out on any Occaſion after the Enemy. There is neither <hi>Bread</hi> nor <hi>Meat, Shoes, Blanketts,</hi> &amp;c, that a Number of Men may take on any ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Occaſion. They have their Bread to bake, their Meat to cook, and other Things to get; when they ſhould be on their March: And ſo long as this is the Caſe, the Enemy never need fear our annoying of them when they have diſtreſſed us.</p>
            <p n="8">8thly. It is obſervable, That all this War we have never kept Men in the Woods towards <hi>Crown-Point</hi> to diſcover their large Bodies coming down upon us, and give Notice of an approaching Enemy: So that they come ſecurely Week after Week upon us; yea, we have ſince found that the Enemy have camp'd <hi>ſeveral Months</hi> within <hi>thirty</hi> or <hi>forty Miles</hi> of <hi>Fort-Dummer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9thly. Another Thing obſerveable, Is the great <hi>Temptation</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers have to be <hi>unfaithful</hi> in the Service. For there is no Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made, as to their <hi>Wages,</hi> between a Soldier <hi>poſted</hi> in an Old <hi>Town,</hi> one in a <hi>Garriſon,</hi> and one <hi>marching</hi> in the Woods; who when he is in the Woods, wears out as many Cloths as his Wages will procure, beſides all his Hardſhips and Sufferings. Soldiers therefore chooſe to Lodge in the Garriſon; and think hard if they muſt be kept in the Woods, when others have as much Pay in <hi>Old</hi> Towns, who eat and lodge well.</p>
            <p n="10">10thly. <hi>We</hi> differ much from the <hi>French</hi> with Reſpect to the War. They will not give Men Commiſſions, 'till they have been out in the War and done ſome Spoil on their Enemies. If the like Method was pactiſed with us; there would be fewer Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
<pb n="22"
                   facs="unknown:006488_0023_10290EFEEF517AC8"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>and more its probable would be done on the Enemy, in order to obtain them: But ſo long as no Regard is had to this in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of Men, we can't expect Men will exert themſelves as they ought to do.</p>
            <p n="11">11thly. The Reader may obſerve, How much the People in the <hi>Weſtern-Frontiers,</hi> muſt be diſtreſs'd by the War; and how falſely they judge, who think the War is an Advantage to them. Their Caſe is moſt diſtreſſing: The repeated Alarms take them off from their Buſineſs <hi>Day after Day</hi> for <hi>forty</hi> or <hi>fifty</hi> Miles together. And the Reader is to obſerve, that in the preceeding Hiſtory there is no mention of great Numbers of Times of the Enemy being ſeen and ſhot at, both in the Night and Day Time; and of their ſetting open Gates, and turning Creatures into Fields to devour Crops. It was not the Deſign of the Author to give you an Account of the People's Loſſes; but of the Miſchief done: If any envy the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants in the Frontiers their Portion, they may come and take their Lot with them.</p>
            <p n="12">12thly, It ought to be obſerved, That great Injuſtice is done the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> in the <hi>Frontiers</hi> in <hi>preſſing</hi> them out of their Buſineſs, into the Province Service, either to follow the Enemy or convoy Stores, and not rewarding them ſuitably. They are ſent out Day after Day with their Horſes, and have <hi>not half</hi> ſo much per Day as they muſt give a Man to labour for them in the mean Time.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, We may obſerve, Than in this War, as we encreaſed <hi>our</hi> Number of Men in our <hi>Forts</hi> or <hi>Scouts,</hi> the Enemy have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed <hi>their</hi> Numbers; and the longer the War continued, the oftner they came, and the more bold they grew. Which ſhows us, what we muſt expect, if the War breaks out a-new: Eſpecially at this Time, when there is no Proviſion made for Men in our Frontiers.</p>
