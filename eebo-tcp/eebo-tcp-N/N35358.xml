            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SOME years ago there was in England a company of foot-pads and highway-men, connected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether under certain laws and regulations, having a language (and books printed in that language) pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to themſelves, called the Flaſh Company,—a ſimilar gang of plunderers has infeſted the United-States ever ſince the late war; and almoſt all the perſons who have been hanged of late in North-America, have belonged to this company. Of this company are the two convicts <hi>Thomas Mount</hi> and <hi>James Williams,</hi> now lying in Newport gaol under ſentence of death, for burglary. Both of theſe are noted villains, as well by legal evidence as their own confeſſion; and were there no others, theſe were ſufficient to contaminate all the unwary youth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the continent, and to deprive the good people of theſe States of one of the higheſt bleſſings of heaven, that of ſitting quietly under their vine and under their fig-tree and none to make them afraid. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams,</hi> whether from artifice or an inferior degree of guilt, has not divulged the Flaſh proceedings near ſo fully as <hi>Mount,</hi> whoſe information, therefore, is the ſubject matter of the following ſheets, and this is the cauſe why <hi>Williams'</hi> name occurs ſo ſeldom here. The diſcerning public will readily ſee my motives for handing theſe papers to them.

            <head>The Voluntary Confeſſion of Thomas Mount.</head>
            <p>I THOMAS MOUNT, now under ſentence of death in the gaol of Newport, and to be executed agreeable to my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, at Little-Reſt, on the 27th of this month of May— in bodily health and ſound mind, and full of ſorrow and regret for my wicked life, in ſincerity and truth make the following confeſſion:</p>
            <p>My parents, Samuel Mount and Mary Dobbs, lived in Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dletown, in Eaſt-Jerſey, where I was born ſome time, I believe, in 1764. My father, for the benefit of his family, removed to New-York when I was about four or five years old, where I and my brothers were put to ſchool; they, viz. Adam and Joſeph, now living in good repute in New-York, profited in their ſtudies —I played truant, hated learning and every ſort of good inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. upon Sundays eſpecially was fond of doing miſchief ſuch as robbing orchards, and ſpreading my wicked example among all the boys I could get acquainted with.—I began to deſpiſe my parents, and to count every thing they ſaid to, or did for me, as beneath my regard; and having never learned to know my duty, either towards God, or towards man, or myſelf, I deſpiſed all religion; and at the age of 10 or 11, quitted my parents, who often told me I ſhould one day come to an evil end, and went to ſea on board one Capt. Hammond, bound for Antigua, thence to Statia, Navis, St. Kitts, Santacruiz, Sanctakes and Savannah. At Savannah I left him, and went on board the Florida brig bound for Jamaica; then I left him and went to live with one Mr. Kennedy in Kingſtown, with him I lived about five or ſix weeks, then left him and got aboard of a ſloop Capt. Alboy, and returned in her to New-York. In 1775, the war breaking out, I quitted my parents again, and li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ted with Capt. Palmer, and went with him to Albany, thence to Fort George, thence to Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conderoga, thence to Crown-Point, thence to St. John's, thence to Montreal, thence returned to Albany, and being ſick was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed. As ſoon as I recovered, I lifted again, and went to Fort George, where I remained five weeks, and was diſmiſſed on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my youth, ſo I returned to live with my parents, at New-York. Not reliſhing the good rules and advice of my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,

again I left them and went to live with one John Mino<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, at Stonnington-point, with whom I remained ſix or ſeven months; when he was drafted to go with the militia—I propoſed to go in his ſtead; accordingly went, and at Groton, near New-London, availing myſelf of the privileges of a militia man, I liſted in the continental army under Col. Huntington, and accompanied him to Denbigh, when the Britiſh troops landed and burnt it.—At Valley-Ford, in Pennſylvania, I deſerted the American, and went over to the Britiſh army, then lying in Philadelphia. In a few days after this, I and two companions broke into a ſoap-boilers' ſtore (this is my firſt act of theft) and ſtole ſome ſoap. When the Britiſh troops left Philadelphia, I came along with them through the Jerſies, to New-York, thence to Staten-Iſland, where I broke open a ſtore in the night ſoon after our arrival, and took a large quantity of goods, and about twenty dollars in caſh, and the night following I broke into the ſame ſtore and took a larger quantity of goods than I had done the former night. Determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deſert for fear of a diſcovery, I and two of my companions confined the corporal that commanded the patrol, and ſo we eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped and went off to the American army, into the Jerſies.— With my uncle Joſeph Cox, at Embley's-Town, who married my father's ſiſter, I remained ſome weeks; but ſoon wearied of this too quiet ſort of life, I left my uncle and went to Philadelphia where I entered on board a ſchooner, Captain Strong, bound to Cape-Francois from whence I returned ſafe to Philadelphia; and in about four weeks after my return I entered again on board the ſame veſſel, and then run off with the advanced pay, and entered on board the St. James, Capt. King, and cheated him of a month's advanced pay; next entered on board the Plow brig, Capt. Browſter, with whom I went to ſea, and in 24 hours were taken by the Cyble frigate, carried into New-York and put on board the Jerſey priſon-ſhip, from whence in about eleven or twelve days I eſcaped to New-York, where I entered on board the Macaroni privateer, and cheated the Captain of four or five guineas, the advance money. In a day or two after this I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered on board a ſchooner, received the advance money and made off with it. Next I was apprehended by the Britiſh regiment (the fourth battalion of Jerſey volunteers) to which I formerly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and was brought before a court-martial, but received no puniſhment on account of my youth. Under no reſtraint, and already hardened by the eſcapes I had made, I determined to double my diligence, if poſſible to arrive at the head of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; accordingly, next ſtole a watch from one Mr. Kelly;
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:046227_0005_1020FDF4B0BE1E70"/>

The regiment now removing to Newtown, on Long-Iſland, I went with them, and in a few days after our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, I and one Henry Milton ſtole two horſes and rode off with them to Brookland, and then let them go; next day after we came to Brookland, we were apprehended and carried back to the regiment and tried for deſertion: Henry Milton was acquitted, and I ſentenced to receive 500 laſhes; but the day before my puniſhment commenced, I broke out of the guard-houſe, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped to the eaſt end of the iſland, but there was taken up by Colonel Thomſon's light horſe, and carried to Huntington, thence under guard to Jerico, there committed to the care of one of the Yougers to carry me to the regiment.—The Youger's pocket I picked, as he ſat by me in the waggon, and threw all his papers down on the road within five or ſix miles of Jamaica; ſome time after we came out of the carriage at Jamaica, I told him that I ſaw the driver pick his pockets and take all his papers and throw them down on the highway, about five or ſix miles from hence. Seeing the waggon at ſome conſiderable diſtance, the Youger, deſiring me to follow him, purſued after the wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goner, that inſtant I took a contrary direction and ſo eſcaped. I went down as far as South-Hole and then got over in a trading boat to the main, and travelled towards New-Haven, there one day went into a ſhop and ſtole out of a drawer a ſmall quantity of caſh; next day, out of another ſtore, I ſtole from the caſh-box five or ſix crowns and dollars with two French guines; ſame day in the afternoon I went into another ſhop and ſtole about ten pounds in ſilver and one Engliſh guinea. Leaving this place, I ſet off for Philadelphia, where I liſted into Col. Myland's light-horſe, he fourth regiment of dragoons: ſoon after this peace took place, I quitted the army entirely. Immediately after my leaving the army, I broke open
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:046227_0006_1020FDF63A9AA3C8"/>
a continental ſtore, and ſtole two pair of boots, and a parcel of ſhirts; a few days after I ſtole a piece of calico, thirty yards, in company with James Dawſon; ſome little time after this, I ſtole from a kitchen door a ſilver tankard belonging to Mr. Penroſe,— it was inſtantly miſſed; Dawſon had cut it up, but one of the Captains of the garriſon intercepted it, and Dawſon and I were taken up and tried for the theft; he got 25 laſhes, and I 100 laſhes for the theft, and 25 for giving the court ſaucy anſwers. No ſooner was this account ſettled, but I proceeded in my old way, and ſtole three large ſilver ſpoons from Mr. Joſeph Carſon, in Water-Street; next day or ſo, in the evening, I went into an apothecary's ſhop and took his caſh-box, containing about ten pounds; a week after this I went into a ſhop in—ſtreet, and took another piece of calico; ſome days after I was taken up for a debt I owed to Mr. Carſon and put in gaol; whilſt in gaol, the woman to whom I and Dawſon had ſold the calico, which I ſtole from Mr. Pool, was apprehended, having on a gown of it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that ſhe had bought it of me, accordingly I was tried for the theft and received 21 laſhes, and ſentenced to impriſonment for court charges of fine and reſtitution money; the very ſecond day after I broke gaol and eſcaped, I picked the pocket of one Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaty or about three or four dollars and two depreciation notes of about ſixty pounds each; leaving Philadelphia, I went to Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington, and there paſſed the notes; thence went to New York, and lived with my brother Adam about one or two months at the baking buſineſs; here I got acquainted with John Lipton, and we broke open a hen-rooſt and ſtole a parcel of fowls; next day leaving New-York, we went upon Long-Iſland, thence to Oſtend, and ſo on to New-London; upon the road Lipton ſtole a watch, but the owner miſſing it, purſued us, and we in a very cowardly manner give it up to him. We journeyed to Sagg-Harbor, thence croſſed over to New-London, and from thence to Boſton; there the firſt day of our arrival we ſtole a few articles, ſuch as ſhoes, and other wearables; but finding Boſton no proper place for us then, on account of the alarms about ſtolen goods before our arrival, we ſet out to go back to New-York. —Having travelled about twelve or fourteen miles from Boſton, in the night we broke open a ſtore that ſtood upon the road, and took ſome caſh and twenty five pair of women's ſhoes, a large quantity of nutmeg and a gun; and travelling along with our booty, we came up to a waggon with a trunk of goods tied on it, ſtanding at a tavern door, we broke open the trunk and taking out of it a large quantity of chintz, laces, ſilk and cotton hankerchiefs, we left in their ſtead the ſhoes and gun;

our next ſtep was to ſecure our flight, by taking two horſes out of the ſtable at the ſame place, and rode the remainder of the night, and in the morning turned them off, whilſt we retired to the woods during the day; and when night came on we purſued our journey toward Worceſter; but hearing a waggon behind us, we went out of the road a little till it ſhould go paſt us, we fixed our eye upon it, and ſaw one man only in it and he ſeemed to be aſleep; the waggon ſoon ſtopt, we ſuppoſe at the onwers' houſe, ſtraitway we made up to it, robbed the ſleeping man of all he had, about four or five dollars, and left him ſound aſleep to purſue our journey, ſelling our goods after the beſt manner we could, pretending to be ſpeculating ſailors, till we arrived at New-York. Soon after our arrival at New-York, we liſted with the troops deſtined for the Ohio expedition; the ſecond or third night after our enliſtment, we broke open a dwelling-houſe belonging to Mr. Hyde, where Lipton formerly lived, and took a ſilver watch, a guinea, ſome ſmall money, and a ſilver ſtock buckle; a few nights after being informed by one Millar, whoſe right name was Copy Gelly, that there was money in a houſe cloſe by Mr. Lither's ſhip-yard, Millar, Lipton and I broke into this houſe, took a watch, and a pair of ſilver buckles, but were diſcovered juſt as we were ready to ſeize upon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, yet we eſcaped. Having now received the bounty and our clothes, we deſerted from the regiment, and we three, viz. Lipton, Millar and I, went out about five or ſix miles from New-York, and there Millar went down a chimney and ſtole a watch, and handed it to me through a window. Our next route was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards New-Haven, and within about four or five miles of New-Haven, we broke into a dwelling-houſe where a phyſician lived, at the ſign of the ball, here we took ſome money and departed; thence to Hartford, here we liſted with the troops going againſt the Indians with Capt. Hart; we received the bounty-money, and in two or three days deſerted. Lipton choſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a little while at Hartford; Millar and I ſet off for Boſton. Within about four or five miles of Providence we broke into a dwelling-houſe and ſtole ſome ſilver ſpoons, then ſtrait to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and the very ſame night broke into a dwelling-houſe near Mr. Sterry's houſe and took a large ſilver ſpoon and a quantity of clothes; and next day leaving Providence, ſet out for Boſton: here we went to board with Mrs. Ritch, and when ready to leave her, we ſtole from her a pattern of a ſilk and cotton jacket, and ſet off for Dedham, where we broke open the dwelling-houſe of Mr. Newall, and ſtole a large quantity dry goods, for which we were apprehended and tried, and being found guilty, received 30

laſhes, I was put upon the gallows one hour with a rope round my neck, and ſent to Caſtle-William for three years. After about eighteen months confinement, in a foggy day I eſcaped from thence by ſwimming three miles, and juſt as I was approaching the wharves a boat took me up, with an intention of delivering me up to the Caſtle, from whence they ſuppoſed I had eſcaped; a little after we were on ſhore, and being favoured by the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the night, I run off from them. Next day I arrived at Providence, and got into employ with one Capt. De Wolf, late from Guinea; ſoon left him, and ſet out for Norwich Landing, where I fell in with an old companion, Archibald Taylor (ſince executed in Boſton) and nex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> day ſetting out for Boſton, upon the road we robbed a woman of a gold earlock and a ſilk handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, and uſed her very ill beſides; a few miles further on the road, I ſtole a gold ring and a tortoiſe ſhell ſilver mounted fan, in Plainfield; here we changed our minds, and returned to Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich Landing, where I ſtole a ſurtout; the firſt night after our return we broke into a ſtore belonging to Mr. Devitt, and took about ſeventy or eighty pounds worth of dry goods; took the goods along and ſet off for New-London, and within two or three miles of that place; hid the greateſt part of them in Mr. Parſon's barn among hay: at New-London we were both apprehended on ſuſpicion, I having the art of repreſenting myſelf innocent got clear, but my companion was confined in gaol. Being ſet at lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, I went to Mr. Parſon's houſe, where I ſtaid two or three days, and ſet off one evening towards New-York with a part of the goods, which I diſpoſed of by the way. As ſoon as my mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was ſpent, in New-York, I left that place and ſet off to go back to Mr. Parſon's for the reſt of the goods; at Milford I got a companion to go with me, one John Delavan, we found the goods juſt as I had left them, and ſet out with them to New-Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where we tarried a few days; in the mean time Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van received from me a part of the goods for his trouble; and making free to ſteal more of them made off with them to his houſe at Milford. In a day or two after De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lavan left me, having ſold the reſt of the goods to different people, I and one Harry M'Cormic hired a boat to carry us to Milford; we run her aſhore among the rocks, and before morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhe ſtove all to pieces; from hence walking to Milford, I called upon Delavan, made him deliver up to me ſuch goods as he had not ſold. Leaving Milford, M'Cormic and I ſat out for New-York, where in two or three days we fell in with another of our companions, George Gardiner (from Greenock, a famous key-maker.) Juſt before leaving New-York, where M'Cormic

ſtayed behind, I called on my brother Adam and received about four dollars from him; prepared for our journey, we then ſet out for Philadelphia, where next day after our arrival, Gardiner and I opened a barber's ſhop in Water-ſtreet, with a falſe key, and ſtole razors, tooth drawers, &amp;c. next day I ſtole ſome paper money; ſome days after fell in with John Lipton and Daniel Kalaghan; by agreement we four ſet out for Baltimore, upon our way through Charleſton, there, with a falſe key, opened a ſtore, and took about twenty pounds worth of goods; we carried them as far as Suſquehanna ferry and there hid them, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued our journey. At Buſhtown we attempted to break open a ſtore, but were diſcovered, yet we eſcaped. Arrived in Baltimore, we fell in with our old friend Holmes, and on the third day after Holmes and I went to fetch the goods we had hid at Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quehanna ferry; we found them as I left them, and returned, ſelling them by the way. In Baltimore I ſtole a watch and a ſurtout out of a houſe; a few nights after we broke open a houſe and ſtole a large quantity of clothing and a piece of broadcloath. Gardiner and Kalaghan choſe to remain in Baltimore, whilſt I and Lipton ſhould ſet off for Annapolis and ſell the goods we had upon hand: At Annapolis Lipton was apprehended for breaking open the ſtore in Baltimore and impriſoned. Before I left Annapolis, to mend my luck, I ſtole ſome black ribbon and a few more trifles. Again Kalaghan joined me, and another companion (I cannot remember his name.) We three ſet out for Alexandria, where I fell in with James Brown; he and I one day ſtole ſome ſilk handkerchiefs and a beaver hat; next day Gardiner and Stewart joined us; they had fled from Alexandria, where they broke into a ſhop and had taken a large quantity of goods, and hid them; next day they went for the goods they had hid, and we all four in company ſet out for Dumfries, where I and Stewart were apprehended and all the falſe keys found with us. Gardiner and Brown eſcaped, Stewart and I were thrown into Dumfries gaol, and thence carried to Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria. We were tried, and nothing found againſt us, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we were all ſentenced to lie in gaol a year and a day, or get ſome one to be ſurety for our good behaviour. In the ſecond week of our impriſonment we broke gaol: At Wilmington, on our way to Philadelphia, we broke into a dwelling-houſe and ſtole a great many things, next day were apprehended and ſent to Newcaſtle gaol, from whence in two or three weeks, we eſcaped. Arrived at Philadelphia, I left Stewart and took another com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponion, one Griffin, paſſed ſome counterfeit New-York money, ſtole ſome handkerchiefs, a beaver hat, a ſurtout, and two ſhawls, from different ſhops; next, in company with Griffin and one

Fogg, in the night time, broke into a ſtore and took cheeſe, ſugar, coffee, and ſeveral other grocery goods. Fogg was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, Griffin and I eſcaped, and quickly leaving Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, we ſet off for New-York: On our way, at Perthamboy, we ſtole ſome black ſilk handkerchiefs. Arrived at New-York, Griffin, John Taylor and I broke into a ſtore belonging to Mr. Ford, and took a large quantity of ſhoes, tea, cherry-rum, &amp;c. next day, for this tranſaction, we were all apprehended and tried; I got clear, my companions were branded, getting the benefit of clergy, and ſo were diſmiſſed. Then Ford ſwore his life againſt me, and got me ſhut up in priſon about eight or nine months: I got out upon condition of quitting the place in twelve hours, and returned to Philadelphia, where, next day after my arrival, I ſtole a piece of chintz and a piece of calico, from a ſtore in Market Street; a few nights after I and David Griffin, and one Logan, a tailor, in Iriſhtown, broke open a dwelling-houſe in Walnut-Street, and ſtole a large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of dry goods; next day I and Griffin were apprehended, the goods were found where we had hidden them in a church then building; I and Griffin were committed to gaol; next day after our impriſonment, a man appeared who ſwore high-way robbery againſt me, which I was innocent of. After being confined about eight weeks I broke out, and in company with George Williams and Daniel Kalaghan ſet off to paſs through the Jerſies; upon our way ſtole ſome money, about two dollars, from a man into whoſe houſe we had gone to reſt our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and in Allentown we attempted to break open a ſtore, but did not ſucceed; thence to Middletown, croſſed over to Long-Iſland; thence to Huntington; thence to Norwalk, where we three broke open a ſchooner and ſtole ſome clothes; on the ſame night broke open a ſtore belonging to Squire Lockhart in Norwalk, from whence we took about ſeventy or eighty pounds in goods and ſome ſilver buckles, and about two pounds in caſh; next day we were apprehended and tried, firſt for robbing the ſchooner; I and Kalaghan were found guilty and received 10 laſhes a piece, Williams got clear; and then we were all three com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to Fairfield gaol, and tried for breaking open the ſtore. I took all the blame upon myſelf and cleared the other two, and received the puniſhment, 35 laſhes and five years impriſonment. Eight or nine days after my whipping broke out of gaol, and I, Kalaghan, Kennedy and Williams ſet off for Norwich Landing, with an intention of breaking open a ſtore, but did not ſucceed. Upon the way we ſtole ſome ſhirts and trowſers, and then we parted, Kalaghan and Kennedy took the road for Providence,

Williams and I to Norwich Landing; and at a dance in Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich Landing I took a ſilk cloak from a young lady, and ſold it about two or three miles from Pockatanock bridge, and then ſet off for Providence; here I ſtayed and wrought a week or two with Mr. Brown, under the name of Charles Minor; then leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Providence I ſet off for Boſton, where I fell in company with James Williams, for the firſt time of our connection. I ſtole ſome buckles, and then, in company with Williams, ſet out for Newbury-Port, there I broke open a ſchooner, and took out of her ſome clothes, chocolate, and tobacco, and a bottle of rum; Williams ſtood upon the wharf and helped to take the things, we then ſet off for Portſmouth, and on the way I ſtole an axe and ſold it for a pair of ſhoes. At Portſmouth I left Williams, and returned to Newbury-Port, there I fell in company with one Mr. Farrington, a gentleman thief: Next night we two broke open a dwelling-houſe, and took ſome ſilk gowns and womens ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel out of it; there I got apprehended on account of robbing a brig in Portſmouth, having part of the goods with me that were taken out of her by Williams, I was confined two or three days in gaol and then liberated. Leaving Newbury-Port I ſet off for Boſton alone, where I broke open a ſchooner and took a parcel of clothes out of her; from thence returned to Providence, where I fell in company with John Hickcock. Leaving Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in a few days, we two ſet off for Norwich Landing, there we attempted to break open a ſtore, and while I was lifting up Hickcock in at the window, the gentleman of the houſe alarmed us and we eſcaped: From thence we went to New-London, where we broke open a ſtore and took ſome money, twenty or thirty ſhillings, and ſome cotton and ſilk handkerchiefs, &amp;c. and then ſet off for Newport and ſold ſome of the goods in Newport; here Hickcock and Weathers broke open a ſtore belonging to Mr. John Hadwen; for this I was apprehended and committed to gaol for two or three days, then was cleared, and ſet off for Hartford, upon the way I attempted to break open a houſe in Stonington, but being diſcovered I fled out of town to Hartford, thence returned towards Providence, upon the way broke open a dwelling-houſe in Connecticut, and ſtole ſome ſilver and pew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpoons, a hat and a tankard Carrying the goods with me I arrived at Providence and ſold them; here I worked with Mr. Brown a week or two under the name of Charles Minor; then I ſtole a pair of ſhoes out of Mr. Roger's ſtore where I had gone to receive my pay; next I went to Nancy Smith and told her I was a fortune-teller, and repeating ſeveral things that I had heard of her, ſhe thought I was really a fortune-teller; then I

propoſed to marry her, and ſhe approved of my offer; then I ſaid I wanted to tell Miſs Sally Brown's fortune, but could not in her father's houſe leſt it ſhould offend him, and aſked whether it would be agreeable to bring down Sally Brown to her room; but this I could not do unleſs I was diſguiſed; accordingly I deſired her to give me ſome clothes for the purpoſe; ſhe gave me a cloak and a ſurtout, but my plan was to run off with them. All this while I was aboard the Waſhington, Capt. Donalſon, and Mr. Nightengale, as he thought he knew me aboard the Alliance frigate, but was not the purſer, truſted me with money in advance. Leaving Providence with the advance money, I ſet off for Boſton, there I took ſome ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s; from thence I went to Newbury-Port, where I fell in company with a young ſailor going to viſit his friends, carrying ſome handkerchiefs and ſhawls, we walked together about 14 or 15 miles, and at night we put up at Mr. Lovet's tavern betwixt Newbury-Port and Portſmouth; in the night I got up and robbed him of all he had, I took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four or five dollars in caſh, a piece of calico, and two or three ſhawls, a pair of new ſtocklngs, a pair of new ſhoes, a pair of new buckles, a pair of new trowſers, a new ſhirt, and a beaver hat, a cotton and ſilk jacket, and a ſilk ſtriped jacket, a pot of ſweet pomatum, two books and two letters, and a parcel of oranges; from thence I went to Boſton by the way of Exeter; arrived in Boſton, I fell in company with Robert Treſſon and Thomas Sheridan, where I took one or two ſhawls, and ſet out from Boſton to go to Connecticut, about ten miles from Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fret, Treſſon and I attempted to rob a houſe, but were diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; then on we went to Pomfret, where we all three were concerned in robbing a waggon, and took two pieces of home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made bearſkin, and on the ſame night broke open a blackſmith's ſhop, and got ſome tools wherewith to break open a ſtore belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Lemming Groſvernor, took about 110 pounds worth in goods, and about two or three dollars in caſh, then ſet off to Norwich Landing; about two miles from Norwich Landing, one Mountſeer lives, who is known to this ſort of buſineſs, there we got apprehended, and ſent to Windham gaol; Sherridan turned evidence againſt us, and we were tried and found guilty, and I received 40 laſhes and to be impriſoned ſix months, Treſſon 30, and to be impriſoned three months: Within the firſt two months of our impriſonment, Robert Treſſon, William Stanton, Gerſhom Palmer and I, being all in one apartment, broke gaol. Treſſan, Stanton and I went to Voluntown, there Stanton left us and Treſſon and I went to Boſton, where I ſtole two patterns of ſilk jackets. Here meeting with William Engliſh, one of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:046227_0013_1020FE0A423984E0"/>
we three ſet off for Portſmouth; there we attempted to rob a ſtore, but a fire breaking out in the town at that inſtant, prevented us; hearing the fire called we ran to where the fire was, there Treſſon ſtole a jacket from Oliver Whipple, Eſq. in the pockets thereof were a forty pound note of hand, a penknife and a comb; next day we three were apprehended on ſuſpicion of ſetting the houſe on fire, but were acquitted; then I ſet off alone to Kennebunk, in Maſſachuſetts, eaſtward of Portſmouth, and there broke open a ſtore belonging to Meſſrs. Condy and Clark, and ſtole a large quantity of dry goods and eſcaped about 70 miles, and then was apprehended, in conſequence of an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement, and committed to Old-York gaol, from whence after three weeks I broke out and ſet off for Portſmouth. The next night after my arrival at Portſmouth, I broke open the houſe of Mr. Chadwick, the gaoler, and ſtole ſome money and a quantity of mens and womens clothes, and gave Treſſon (whom I found here in priſon) part of the money and two ſaws, and then ſet off towards Newbury-Port: Next morning Treſſon called the gaol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper and told him that it was I that robbed him, and had given him two ſaws and a dollar in money, wherewith to effect his eſcape; then the gaoler ſent a purſuer after me, who appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended and carried me back to Portſmouth gaol, from thence I was carried to Exeter for my trial; upon Treſſon's evidence I was found guilty, but received no puniſhment by reaſon that I promiſed to inform of all thoſe perſons who received ſtolen goods, and how the houſe was ſet on fire; and therefore the court ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed one month, and I carried back to Portſmouth gaol; but before the month was expired I broke gaol and ſet off for Boſton, and fell in company with Joſeph Kelly who had two coats and jackets he had ſtolen to bear our expences to Newport. We ſet off for Newport, and immediately upon our arrival, Kelly ſtole a pair of ſilver buckles from Mr.—a Jew, and I ſtole three or four black ſilk handkerchiefs from Mr. Wickham; next I and Kelly broke open a cooper's ſhop to get tools to break into Mr. Wickham's ſtore, but daylight coming on we could not complete our buſineſs. No body pointed out the ſtore to us I had been in it the day before. Then leaving Newport, Kelly and I went to Mansfield, and there we parted; there I broke open a ſtore belonging to Mr. Gilbert, and took a quantity of goods, to the value of about twenty pounds, and with theſe goods ſet off to Voluntown to one Mr. Stedman's a receiver of ſtolen goods; there I again met with Kelly, and getting ſome money of Stedman for ſome of the goods, I returned to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, where I got playing cards with a countryman, cheated

him of ſome money and two dreſſed ſheepſkins; there Kelly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended me to one Lewis who ſupplied us with tools, and then Kelly and I ſet out to break Mr. Roger's ſtore, and had almoſt completed our buſineſs; but being alarmed by two or three men, made our eſcape, and took a couple of horſes and rode almoſt to Voluntown, and then turned them off. At Voluntown we ſtayed one day, and the next ſell in company with James Williams, who told me he was going to Providence to get on board Mr. Brown's Indiaman: I aſked him to go with me the way of Ston<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, and he conſented; ſo Williams, Kelly and I ſet off to William Stanton's (we turned Kelly off telling him that two might keep a ſecret, but three could not) then Williams, Stanton and I ſet off for Hopkinton with an intention to break a ſtore, but did not ſucceed; but Williams and Stanton took a dozen pair of ſtockings off a fence.—Upon our return to Stanton's, I held the horſes at the bridge, Williams and Stanton broke open a mill, and took all the meal and corn they could find, and we carried it to Stanton's houſe: Stanton next day ſent ſome of the corn to Rowſe Babcock's for rum. Next night Stanton, Williams and I ſet off to break into Joſeph Potter's ſtore; I broke open a mill and took a crow-bar out of it, and went to the door and broke it, and we all three went in, I firſt, and they following. Being moſt forward in this buſineſs, I lighted a candle and handed down the goods, about ſeven hundred dollars worth, and ſome money, two or three dollars, and carried them to Stanton's houſe, where we divided them into three parts and caſt lots. Williams and I took our ſhares; after giving Stanton out of my ſhare eight or nine pounds worth of goods for a mare, and hiding the goods under two corn ſtacks and under a barn, about five miles from Stanton's houſe, we ſet off for Voluntown, there were appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and brought back to Hopkinton, where Stanton, I and my wife were tried for breaking open the miil; Stanton's wife and Williams were admitted as State's evidence: accordingly I was ſentenced to receive 20 laſhes and my wife 10 (though ſhe was innocent).—I paid the fine by giving up part of my clothes, then committed to Newport gaol, and tried for breaking Potter's ſhop, found guilty, and received the ſentence of death—And the Lord have mercy upon me.</p>

            <head>The <hi>LAST SPEECH</hi> and <hi>DYING WORDS</hi> of <hi>THOMAS MOUNT,</hi> publiſhed at his own Deſire, for the public Good in general, and for that of his Comrades in particular.</head>
            <p>WHEN I ſee that every attempt to break gaol is unſucceſsful and every effort to prevent my ſuffering an ignominious death, is like to be fruitleſs, I Thomas Mount, in conformity to the cuſtom of publiſhing a laſt ſpeech or dying words, for the benefit of my ſurvivors, do hereby declare this to be my <hi>laſt ſpeech and dying words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And firſt—I pray that the Lord may have mercy upon me, and that all good people may pity and pray for me; and that my ſhameful end may deter others from thoſe actions which have brought me to this dreadful hour.</p>
            <p>Secondly—I deſire to be truly penitent for my crimes, both againſt the law of GOD and the laws of MEN; and to believe that Divine goodneſs hath thus arreſted me in my career of wickedneſs, for his glory and my everlaſting good. I deſire to be more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to my ſentence than I fear I am. So great has been my propenſity to ſtealing, even from my childhood, that were my days prolonged, 'tis more than probable I ſhould get into my old way again. I am horribly afraid to die; and yet confeſs I deſerve not to live: but am certain, that the mercy of government in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning thieves, is no mercy at all to them, for every pardon they get hardens them ſo much the more in their villainy. The only way to reclaim <hi>one</hi> thief, is either to baniſh or hang all the <hi>other thieves</hi> and all the <hi>receivers</hi> of ſtolen goods; for ſo long as there are <hi>receivers</hi> and <hi>thieves</hi> living and at liberty, however penitent <hi>one thief</hi> may be the hour he receives his pardon and freedom yet whenever he gets abroad among his old acquaintances, they will wiſh him joy of his eſcape from the gallows; they will get drunk with him; they will carry him to the places of rendezvous, where the women and liquors are all in common, and with rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their wonderful eſcapes from juſtice, with the ſtimulating ſongs of his comrades, with the artful behaviour of the ſcandals of their ſex, he becomes ten-fold more a child of the devil than he was before.</p>
            <p>Thirdly—Nothing corrupts young fellows more, than idleneſs and bad women, who are firſt the ſeducers to all evil, and if their extravagancies are not gratified to the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:046227_0016_1020FE13891EFDD0"/>Fourthly—At my deſire, the language and ſongs of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can flaſh company are publiſhed, to inform the world at large how wicked that company is, and how neceſſary it is to root them up like ſo many thorns and briers which if ſuffered to remain would deſtroy the riſing crop of young fellows throughout the Continent. The whole of the ſecrets concerning this buſineſs, the names of the perſons concerned in carrying it on, whether as thieves or receivers, or ſetters on, or ſuppliers with tools where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with to break out of gaols, or into houſes, to a good friend of mine when under ſentence of death, I have communicated; at the ſame time taking his promiſe that he will tranſmit the ſame to the Governors of the United States of America immediately after my deceaſe, that they may be of general utility to this country.</p>
            <p>Fifthly—I have communicated likewiſe to this gentleman, the various ways of diſcovering thieves and houſe-breakers, ſo that in future it will be next to impoſſible to practiſe the thieving bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs without detection: And as all thieves are great cowards (for the bark of a dog will make them run) I will adviſe every honeſt man who wiſhes to preſerve his property, to remenber the rules I have communicated, and to act upon them; if he does, there is no great chance of being robbed, or having his houſe broke. Likewiſe I would ſubmit it to the judgment of our rulers, whether it would not be proper to fine every man who was rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed on the high-way, provided only two thieves attacked him, becauſe he did not defend himſelf; for the heroiſm of <hi>one</hi> honeſt man is, or ought to be, ſufficient to make <hi>two</hi> thieves run.</p>
            <p>Sixthly—As a dying man, a debtor to my country, and deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of making all the compenſation in my power, I further make known how any man of the leaſt common ſenſe may diſcover a thief,—by his often looking back—turning quick up lanes— ſtanding to gaze at ſigns—and ſtopping to enquire for the houſes of perſons who do not live in the place—going into ſhops and giving the merchant a deal of unneceſſary trouble in calling for a ſight of one thing and another, and of twenty more, without buying one article. If a thief appears in the day time, you ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſee him without his rogue's face on; look at him pretty ſharply, and you will ſee how ſuſpicious and timorous he looks; take him by the hand, it feels ſoft, and your touch makes him ſhrink, you may perceive his hand nervous; but in nothing is this nervouſneſs more perceptible than, if he takes a pen at your deſire, to write with—it will therefore be to aſk all ſuſpected perſons to write, and their hand will inſtantly tell upon their heart.</p>
            <p>Seventhly—I muſt complain to the public of the receivers, or fences, as we call them in the flaſh language,—they are our ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:046227_0017_1020FE15A2CABD00"/>
on, and they cheat us confoundedly; we ſeldom receive from them more than a tenth part of the value, and muſt take it in what pay they pleaſe, and when they pleaſe; and by getting us drunk with our whores, every now and then, they generally ſteal from us all they can poſſibly come at, and then ſet us a fighting with one another about the goods they had taken. Theſe receivers being in league with our whores, make them very extravagant in their demands upon us, who, after treating them with the beſt of our ſpoils, if we do not promiſe quickly to get them more, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to inform againſt us.—In one word, a thief or highway-man is a pitiable animal; he riſks his life every adventure he engages in, and all the recompence he gets for his pains, is the treachery of his whores and comrades, and laſt of all an ignominious death. Though at any time we take a large quantity of goods, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſell them to any account; and after giving huſh-money to ſome, paying a comrade for his help (for we hire one another on ſuch like expeditions, as breaking a ſhop or houſe, or way-laying the ſtage-coach, &amp;c.) and gratifying our pretended friends with preſents, we have ſeldom or never enough to buy decent cloaths, wherein to aſſume the character and appearance of honeſt men and quit bad company, had we ever ſo much mind for it.</p>
            <p>Eighth—When I look back upon a company of thieves, with their whores, met after ſome houſe or ſhop breaking match, full of plunder, and recollect the ſcenes of curſing, ſinging, dancing, ſwearing, roaring, lewdneſs, drunkenneſs, and every poſſible ſort of brutiſh behaviour, I deteſt myſelf for having ſo often been one in ſuch companies.—Under theſe circumſtances we are very liable to be apprehended: and therefore, good people and bad people, thieves and honeſt men, take warning by my fate, and mind my advice; for if ye get into the way of thieving, nothing can cure you but the gallows —I never heard of a thief that was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed but one, and that under ſuch circumſtances as can never be the lot of any other thief to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>Pray for me good people—I am wicked, and there are many others in the United States perhaps as wicked as myſelf; I pray they may depart from their wickedneſs, before their cup of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity becomes full, and they entail upon themſelves the death I am going to ſuffer. It is but juſtice that ſuch as have lived like wolves and beaſts of prey, ſhould die like dogs, and not like men.</p>
            <p>And the Lord have mercy upon me—farewel.</p>
