            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A NARRATIVE OF THE Strange Principles, Conduct and Character of the SHAKERS.</head>
            <p>WHEN we conſider the infant ſtate of civil power in America, ſince the revolution began, every infringement on the natural rights of humanity, every effort to undermine our original conſtitution, either in civil or eccleſiaſtical order, ſaps the foundation of independency. To ſee a body of more than two thouſand people, having no will of their own, but governed by a few Europeans conquering their adherents into the moſt unreſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſubjection, argues ſome inſatuating power; ſome deep, very deep deſign at bottom. To deſcribe what this power is will be the deſign of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Natrative, and by what means this people are ſupported in their deluſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:017735_0003_0FA26A815EF56E28"/>
There are ſew people in this land no doubt but what have heard of the contents of VALENTINE RATHBUN'S Narrative, in which ſome groſs ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities in point of doctrine and worſhip are point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out. But ſince this people have increaſed in numbers, they have eſtabliſhed ſuch orders and founded ſuch inſtitutions among themſelves as ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders it very eaſy to trace them in their diſcipline to the ſeat and foundation of their power. For this purpoſe the writer thinks proper to lay open to the learned world, more particularly, the whole body of their diſcipline, that the publick may be able to judge for themſelves what this power is, and from what it proceeds.</p>
            <p>The predominant principle in the heart of man is the love of dominion and preeminency. Pride is the root of all ſin. From this principle the whole fabrick of that religion is founded. Theſe people are artful, deſigning men, eſpecially their leaders. The common people who are impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on are many of them very ſincere. If any perſon opens his mind to them, as the confeſſion of ſin is termed, they commonly gain their point. The reaſon of their ſucceſs may be attributed on the one hand to a very extraordinary ſkill which theſe people have acquired in hearing confeſſions; and on the other to a likeneſs of principle and motive which creates a peculiar ſympathy and union. They are univerſally of one ſpirit in belief of, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to, and raiſed expectations from their church. Their diſcipline is founded on the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed perfection of their leaders: The Mother, it
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017735_0004_0FA26A82165DFB90"/>is ſaid, obeys God through Chriſt; European el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders obey her; American labourers obey them: The common people obey them while confeſſion is made of every ſecret in nature, from the oldeſt to the youngeſt. The perpetual labours of which gives their teachers experience and ſkill. By this means the people are made to believe themſelves to be ſeen through and through in the goſpel glaſs of perfection by their teachers, as they expreſs themſelves, for hundreds of miles in an inſtant, and that they are arrived to that ſtate of glory by which they behold not only the eſtate of the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but of the dead, with innumerable worlds of ſpirits good and bad.</p>
            <p>When the extraordinary appearance of ſtrange exerciſe in their way of worſhip cauſes a doubt in the minds of any ſpectator, they frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate the innocency of laying open the ſecrets of life, provided a confeſſion is kept concealed, inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating the benefit of the experience of their leaders in particular caſes of conſcience, as being privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged thereby with eſpecial opportunities to judge for themſelves concerning the truth of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</p>
            <p>Such like arguments to a mind that begins to be open to their inſinuations, eſpecially where there has been the weight of ſome burden on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience beforetime, will by the allurement of theſe people, introduce a perſon partly from curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, or ſome impreſſion from theſe inſtructions, to uſe a familiarity of laying open the whole of his life, upon which the greateſt condeſcenſion is paid to the intended proſelyte.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:017735_0005_0FA26A8334738D20"/>
His principles and practices in life are all laid open—predominant vices expoſed—habit of mind and thoughts of his heart are drawn from him. The perſon thus expoſed receives inſtruction ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to ſecret caſes of conſcience; is told that there is no deluſion but only in ſin. That is it which they warn him againſt. And theſe people have a faculty to draw the attention of new pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes into a belief of extraordinary perfection in reſolving the difficulties laid before them, ſtudiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſengaging their attachment to common vice into a ſpirit of idolatry in reſpect to them and their inſtructions, effectually to ſecure their domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over the conſcience. The adherent finds ſome conſiſtency of moral inſtructions and ſkill in determining caſes of conſcience; an eaſy conqueſt over former vices; ſuddenly grows perfect in his own imagination; ſees on the one hand great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity in their ſociety, alike in ſentiment, each one forgoing his old habitual courſe, comented together in oppoſition to a world of perſecution, having one will to govern them though of the female ſex. Which ſympathy, love, power and union in this deluſion they believe to be of God. On the other hand obſerving ſome ſpirit of intemperance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe who are not acquainted with this ſplendid ſcheme of new religion, he is thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in his error. Sometimes they endeavour to frighten thoſe whom they cannot allure, by throwing out a cenſorious ſpirit; by judging all who fall not in with their way; which has the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fired effect, more eſpecially with perſons of a ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous make and conſtitution, which is but a ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017735_0006_0FA26A83A1E08FC8"/>ſcheme in their deluſion. Subſervient to their purpoſes, are ſtrict injunctions laid on every adherent, not to weaken one another by ſcruples of conſcience, trials and darkneſs, ſuch caſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſerved to their elders and teachers; beſides all records and general orders are kept concealed, excepting from the individuals who are particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned.</p>
            <p>The doctrines which are more clearly come to light ſince the firſt riſe of their religion, are as follows, viz.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> That God, through Jeſus Chriſt in the Church, is reconciled with man.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second.</hi> That ſins confeſſed to God's witneſſes are forgiven in the Church as ſoon as forſaken.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third.</hi> That Chriſt is come a light into human nature, to enlighten every man that cometh into the world without diſtinction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourth.</hi> That no man is born of God until by faith he is aſſimulated into the character of Jeſus Chriſt in his Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifth.</hi> That in obedience to that Church a man's faith will increaſe until he comes to be one with Chriſt in the millenium Church ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixth.</hi> That every man is a free agent to walk in the true light, and ſo to chooſe or reject the truth of God within him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:017735_0007_0FA26A87ECF070B8"/>
               <hi>Seventh.</hi> Of conſequence that it is in every man's power to be obedient to the faith without which he ſhall ſuffer ſo much loſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eighth.</hi> That this is the goſpel of the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection which is now preached in that Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ninth.</hi> That all who are born of God (as they explain the new birth) ſhall never taſte of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tenth.</hi> That thoſe who are ſaid to have been regenerated among Chriſtians are only regenerat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in part, therefore are not aſſimulated into the character of Chriſt in his Church while here in the body, of conſequence not taſting the happineſs of the firſt reſurrection, cannot eſcape in part the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Eleventh.</hi> They hold that the word everlaſting when applied to the puniſhment of the wicked, refers only to a limited ſpace of time, excepting in the caſe of thoſe who fall from their Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Twelfth.</hi> That the ſecond death having power over ſuch as riſe not into the character of Chriſt in the firſt reſurrection, will in due time fill up the meaſure of his ſufferings beyond the grave.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirteenth.</hi> That the righteouſneſs and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Chriſt in his members are both one; that every man ſuffers perſonally for himſelf, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible woe and miſery for ſins not repented
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017735_0008_0FA26A89B28D6418"/>of notwithſtanding this union, until final redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourteenth.</hi> They believe Chriſt will never make any publick appearance as a ſingle perſon, but only in his ſaints: That the judgment day is now begun in that Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifteenth.</hi> They believe no ſalvation out of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience to the ſovereignty of their dominion; That all ſin which is committed againſt God, is done againſt them, and muſt be pardoned for Chriſt's ſake through them, for which confeſſion muſt be made to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixteenth.</hi> They believe that their Church is come out of the order of natural generation, to be as Chriſt was; that thoſe who have wives are as though they had none; that by theſe means Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven begins upon earth, and they thereby looſe their ſenſual or earthly relation to Adam the firſt, and come to be tranſparent in their ideas in the bright and heavenly viſions of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventeenth.</hi> They hold to a travel and labour for the redemption of departed ſpirits.</p>
            <p>There are other articles leſs important which they occaſionally advance, which for brevity's ſake muſt be omitted but the above are a ſummary of their principles.</p>
            <p>The writer will now proceed in order to trace them to that ſeat of power which produces thoſe
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017735_0009_0FA26A8A5AEA4628"/>ſtrange operations that are frequent among them. By the ſame caution they uſe in the firſt introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their proſelytes, they carefully lead them by ſeveral degrees into the belief of their tenets, and of conſequence into the ſeveral exerciſes of their worſhip. They firſtly inculcate a principle of paſſive obedience, as introductory to ſome fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture knowledge of divine myſteries to which they will attain by a ſtrict adherence to Church pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. They are exhorted not to deſpiſe (by ſtrict order) the things they underſtand not. And being ſuppoſed to have ſome reſolution of warfare againſt their ſins by perſonal labours, they are bid to judge of the ſafety of communion with that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety by the victory they obtain againſt predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant vice, not to inquire into principles any faſter than as they ſhall come into viſion by leaving their ſin.</p>
            <p>And ſince the human frame and conſtruction of man is ſuch, that great effects may be produced merely by, as it were, a mechanical operation on the nerves, they improve them to excite the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind, as if it were the ſtrange work ſpoken of in Scripture, which ſhould be brought to paſs in the latter days. They therefore exhort their adherents, with great ſolemnity in their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes, to cheriſh ſuch kind of motions upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as are frequently obſerved on the human body of others, telling them the operations of God's ſpirit are in ſcripture ſaid to be diverſe. And that as they become more acquainted with them, although they carry ſome outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of groſs abſurdities in the eyes of the world,

Thus are their proſelytes duped into the belief of ſomething more than common, and are led to judge of every whimſical paſſion of animal nature, ſeparate from grace to be a part of their religion, while they at the ſame time, through a miſled judgment, condemn the grace of God in the hearts of thoſe who make not ſo much of human paſſion. It has been obſerved that perſons who newly open their minds to this ſociety, leave immediately the company of their old neighbours and acquaintances, ſome of their old vicious habits, and all their old religion, and experiences, and are cemented into the union of deep deluſion, reſigning their former wills to this new mother, to be governed by her, through her elders, tutors and labourers, which of conſequence, produce likeneſs of ſentiment and raiſed elevation of mind. However myſterious it may ſeem, numberleſs inſtances can be produced where lyars, ſwearers, drunkards, extortioners, unclean, unjuſt, covetous perſons, proud, ſelf-will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, heady, high minded, &amp;c. at leaſt many of theſe characters have all been brought down to confeſs, and abſolutely for a time to leave their ordinary and common vices for the ſake of uniting into one general ſpirit of downright idolatry, crying out with one voice as in <hi>Acts</hi> xix. 34, great is Diana of the Epheſians; or, great is the Elect Mother of the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers! Theſe people gain advantage to riſe in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity by judging in matters of conſcience; giving
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:017735_0011_0FA26A8BD8219CC0"/>out their precepts; receiving perpetually confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from their converts; elevating their minds in their ſeveral exerciſes; reforming them from the common deluſion of ordinary vice for this grand deluſion, ſtill more notoriouſly abſurd, of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the creature, inſtead of the Creator, who is God bleſſed forevermore. Some have been ready to query if theſe operations can be performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aſſiſtance of ſome ſupernatural power. The delicacy of an anſwer to which requires moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in determining a matter of univerſal enquiry. It will be granted however, by what has been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy written, that great appearances of more than common power may proceed from the union and fellowſhip of ſuch a deluded body of people, whoſe affections and animal ſpirits are cemented into a likeneſs of paſſion and tranſport, being bewitched, as it were, or enchanted with the ſplendid ſhew of perfection: Should this be the moſt favourable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance in regard to that people, and they be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of any abſolute league, but only among themſelves; it is moſt worthy of being truly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from pure and vital religion, and ought to be abhorred and utterly deteſted by all, even as an infringement on the common rights of humanity. For there is a perpetual ſcene of trembling, quiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhaking, ſighing, crying, groaning, ſcreaming, jumping, ſinging, dancing and turning, which ſtrikes the animal part, operating on the nerves of the greateſt oppoſers, in following which the adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent finds an eaſy tranſition from favour with them to go into their ſeveral exerciſes, to mourn and rejoice with them, to kneel, to leap, and dance, to turn and ſhake, and ſometimes to utter
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017735_0012_0FA26A8CBB5CDA88"/>forth their unknown mutter, ſo gibberiſh that a perſon not deluded would imagine they were a company of madmen, by whom their paſſions in different colours are artfully diſplayed; this they call the gift of new tongues, by which their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers oftentimes find themſelves ſeverely ſcolded at, ſometimes mocked, entreated or flattered, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the operation of their ſeveral humours, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently gathering round ſome one of their own company who is not quite obedient enough for them, like ſpiteful birds in fighting, and peck upon him in their unknown mutter, as if they would pick his fleſh from him. If this will not do in ſuch a caſe of diſcipline, the common people are informed of his ſecret ſins, long before confeſſed to the el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and gone before hand to judgment who now begin to hold their diſobedient rebel in open deriſion, ſhewing the anger of God towards him, as they term it. They tell him that God has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to them that he has been guilty of ſuch and ſuch ſins, that he has never repented of them; for if he had, theſe ſins would never have come up again to judgment; that he is in danger of falling away; that it is impoſſible for their church to lay any thing upon him which is contrary to the will of God. All hands fall to, and juſtify ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction he complains of as a matter of grievance. If his mind is perplexed, and he ſeeks to know the reaſon of particular orders, they entangle him in his difficulty to make him comply with his duty, warning him at his peril not to diſpute the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the church, not ſuffering him to enjoy any peace until bewitched with the effect of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, he finally gives up his reaſon, ſenſe, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017735_0013_0FA26A8D578B67A0"/>will and affection, being overcome with their apparent harmony among themſelves, and exceſſive ſeverity towards him. He then receives double congratulations from their whole ſociety, in full rejoicing over him as a ſinner that is brought to repentance. By which time this conquered one is prepared for new battles, in order to help ſubdue the next rebellious wretch who dare diſpute the mighty canons of that auguſt aſſembly.</p>
            <p>A particular account of the writer's experience in five different governments is now fitting for the preſs: In which every uſeful matter of intelligence concerning the riſe of that people, and their ſeveral advances in this new ſyſtem will ſoon be publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Second Number.</p>
            <p>Some of the principal heads of this people are ſaid to be born in the town of Mancheſter, in the weſt of England, and members of Weſt's ſeparate church there.—The names of thoſe who have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided in Harvard, Commonwealth of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts, from May 1781, to February 1782, are <hi>Anna Leeſe,</hi> the Mother, <hi>William Leeſe,</hi> her natural brother, <hi>John Parkinton,</hi> formerly a Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt preacher in England, <hi>James Whittiker,</hi> chief ſpeaker in the Aſſemblies, <hi>James Shepherd</hi> ſaid to have been a merchant in England, beſides two wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of that church, ſeven in all: The reſt of the European Shakers have ſtill reſided in Niſqueunia, above Albany, ſince their firſt ſettlement there, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom Elder <hi>Ocknell,</hi> as he is called by that people, is chief.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:017735_0014_0FA26A91C6BCE638"/>
The above Mother and four Elders have had the lead of government at Harvard, over all their adherents for hundreds of miles round them, who have kept up a ſtore of proviſion, ſufficient for eighty or an hundred people at a time; and on their ſettlement firſt at Harvard, their meeting was kept up by day and night, chiefly in ſinging, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til after they had got ſome footing, when it was immediately turned into heavy dancing, generally about forty or fifty men together, and as many women ſeparate by themſelves in different rooms. Their meetings conſiſted of a conſtant variety of ſome newly come, and others juſt ready to leave them;—ſome would ſtay two, ſome ſix, ſome ten, and ſome twenty days on a viſit;—ſome would come twice, ſome thrice, ſome five, and ſome ten times a piece;—ſome would come twenty, ſome fifty, ſome an hundred, and ſome two hundred miles: Beſides they have had labourers conſtantly going and coming, making new proſelytes, and confirming their old ones further and further in this millenium ſtate of their church as they profeſs; the whole of which is manifeſtly done to introduce popery and eccleſiaſtical power.—Their meetings generally continued every night until about two o'clock after midnight, and very frequently until the break of day; no diſtinction on the ſabbath, excepting on the account of hard labour.</p>
            <p>Theſe people are generally inſtructed to be very induſtrious eſpecially at their own dwelling places of abode, to bring in their ability to keep up their meeting. Multitudes ſpend their whole time this way, and are ſupported by others; they
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017735_0015_0FA26A934018F6A0"/>generally come, and always go, by order. They vary in their exerciſes—their heavy dancing, as it is called, is performed by a perpetual ſpringing from the houſe floor, about four inches up and down, both in the men's and women's apartment, moving about as thick as they can crowd, with extraordinary tranſport, ſinging ſometimes one at a time, and ſometimes more than one, making a perfect charm.</p>
            <p>This elevation draws upon the nerves ſo as that they have intervals of ſhuddering as if they were in a ſtrong ſit of the ague.—They ſometimes clap hands and leap ſo as to ſtrike the joyce above their heads. They throw off their outſide garments in theſe exerciſes, and ſpend their ſtrength very cheerfully this way; their chief ſpeaker of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes calls for their attention, when they all ſtop and hear ſome harrangue, and then fall to dancing again. Sometimes when they are weary of this heavy exerciſe of body, they ſtop and fall on their knees and make a ſound like the roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many waters, in groans and cries to God, as they ſay, for the wicked world who perſecute them.</p>
            <p>There might be written a volume if it were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſettle their character that way; but the writing will be brief, therefore ſhall conclude this firſt number by requeſting thoſe who are maſters of language to excuſe his manner of ſtyle, as not being reviewed by any man of learning, but wrote chiefly at firſt hand, and committed to the preſs, promiſing to accept of the beſt aſſiſtance in the next number—Warning all men to guard againſt
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017735_0016_0FA26A94C40EB240"/>theſe deſtructive errors; deſiring to give publick praiſe to God for his own eſcape from that deluſion.</p>
            <p>It is to be hoped from all people knowing to any part of their character, that neceſſary matters of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence will be minuted down and communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the preſs, ſo that any evidence of witchcraft, or unchaſte behaviour more particularly may be produced from good authority, if any ſuch things there be, which the writer ſhall cheerfully give notice of in his next publication.</p>
            <p>That God may preſerve the United States of America from publick innovations is the deſire of the writer, and that this people may brought to ſee their miſtake will be the unfeigned wiſh of every conſiderate perſon, as it is of</p>
