            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ESSAY on CREDIT, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>CREDIT <hi>is the confidence which mankind place in the virtue and good character of its object;</hi> ſo when we ſay of a man, he is a perſon of credit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, the meaning is, that he is a man in whoſe virtue and good character people in general place confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
            <p>CREDIT, in a commercial ſenſe, <hi>is the confidence which people place in a man's integrity and punctuality, in fulfilling his contracts, and performing his engagements.</hi> When we ſpeak of a merchant of credit, we mean a merchant, in whoſe ability, integrity, and punctuality, in fulfilling his contracts and engagements, people have confidence, i. e. a man of integrity and truth, who is fit to be believed and truſted; the contrary or reverſe of this, i. e. a man of no credit is a man of no integrity in his dealings, who will quibble and ſhuffle, evade his contracts, violate his word and truth, delay his pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, diſappoint his creditors, uſe deceit, chicanery and falſhood, &amp;c. i. e. is not ſit to be believed or truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.—From this view of the matter, it appears that credit is a moſt valuable thing in ſociety, it gives hearts eaſe, it gives wealth, 'tis a nurſe of every ſocial virtue, it makes a ſoil ſuitable for the growth of public ſpirit and every public virtue; the worth and value of this may perhaps be beſt illuſtrated by comparing it or view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in contraſt, with its contrary; how much better do we feel? how much richer do we grow? how much more eaſy, ſafe and ſatisfied do we enjoy ourſelves? when we live among citizens to whom we can give full credit, in whom we can have ſafe confidence, and whom we can truſt, than when we find ourſelves among people to whom we can give no credit, in whom we
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:020129_0003_0FADEC082074D298"/>
can have no confidence, and whom we cannot truſt, and where every concern or contract we make with them is attended with anxiety, uneaſineſs and fear, and commonly followed by deceit, loſs and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; in this caſe, I deſire, I can need no better ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, no better proof, no better explanation of my ſubject, than an appeal to the inſtant feelings of my fellow-citizens.</p>
            <p>BUT however valuable and excellent in ſociety, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever profitable and haypyfying, however ſoothing to our warmeſt wiſhes credit public or private may be, <hi>'tis in vain to hope for it, or even to imagine the poſſibility of its exiſtence, without its proper object, which is honeſty or integrity,</hi> it can no more be forced by laws, it can no more be obtruded by authority, however high and puiſſant, than an article of faith can be forced on the underſtanding, without proper proof or evidence.— <hi>Credit and honeſty are in their nature correlatives, and muſt and forever will imply and ſupport each other.</hi> Integrity will generate credit and confidence the moment 'tis known in any part of the world, and the moment that integrity or honeſty is obſerved to ceaſe, the credit or confidence which was generated by it, inſtantly ceaſes too; it dies, it can never be brought to draw another breath, after the integrity which generated it, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied all its vital motions, is gone.</p>
            <p>'TIS here to be noted, that however neceſſary and even eſſential integrity is to credit, yet in a commercial ſenſe, i. e. as far as it relates to trade, money or wealth, 'tis not the only thing neceſſary, <hi>power or ability muſt be added,</hi> for however clear and plain it is, that an honeſt man will never contract beyond his power of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, yet it often happens that his power of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance may be much leſſened between the time of contract and the time of fulfillment, by many incidents, which may and do often take place, which at once leſſen his credit, or the confidence of his neighbours in his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements;
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:020129_0004_0FADEC090296AC88"/>
theſe incidents often affect honeſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants ſo deeply, as to occaſion their failure or bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy, and their failure often produces another in their creditors, that a third and that a fourth, &amp;c. This ſucceſſion of failures often originates in a ſwind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler or raſcal, who knowingly contracts vaſtly beyond his ability of performance, and of courſe ruins not only himſelf, but a numerous ſucceſſion of honeſt men. This affords us one inſtance of the vaſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief which a community may and often does ſuffer from one diſhoneſt man reſiding among them; very many others might be produced of like miſchief, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in a great variety of ways, and to ſuch a degree that a national character may be deeply ſtained by the iniquity and knavery of a few. This ſhews that it is of moſt ſerious conſequence to every ſtate, to uſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poſſible means, not only to preſerve the national credit and character of their ſtate in good purity and honor, but alſo to introduce as far as may be, habits of integrity and honor among their citizens, and extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, as far as can be done, all ſuch villainous and ſcandalous practices, as naturally tend to diſgrace the national character, and ruin the fortunes of private citizens.</p>
            <p>THESE obſervations will appear with greater force and advantage, if we recur for a moment, to what I juſt now mentioned, viz. the great eaſe, ſatisfaction, and convenience of living in a ſtate where the public finance is ſo managed, that all private citizens can ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rely on the juſtice and punctuality of the public en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, and where the habits of honeſty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity are ſo general among the private citizens, that they may ſafely truſt one another, ſo that credit and mutual confidence in each other may prevail through the community. Thus circumſtanced, every man may ſafely employ his ſtock in any buſineſs of advantage, either of merchandiſe, mechaniſm, or huſbandry; whereas if he lived in a ſtate, and among citizens of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:020129_0005_0FADEC0D1436DDA0"/>
contrary character, <hi>he would be afraid to let his ſtock go out of his own keeping, leaſt it ſhould fall into hands either public or private, which would retain it from him, ſo that he could not recover it again, though the advantages of improvement both to the public and himſelf, might be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great and inviting.</hi>—In a ſtate, and among citizens ſo happily diſpoſed, any man, with induſtry and oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, though his means were ſmall, might live very eaſy and comfortable, and the man of fortune might improve his eſtate very ſafely and happily, to the great advantage both of the public and himſelf. Strangers would have every encouragement to flock in to ſuch a ſtate, and thereby increaſe the population, and of courſe the commerce, manufactures, and huſbandry of it.</p>
            <p>FROM this view of the ſubject it appears ſtrikingly evident, that credit, both public and private, and the mutual confidence of citizens in the public juſtice, and in each other, is of moſt momentous advantage, of moſt capital convenience, both to the public and to the individual members of it, it contributes moſt decidedly and eſſentially to the internal eſtabliſhment, ſecurity and ſafety of the government, and to the eaſe, wealth and happineſs of private citizens, therefore it follows, that <hi>'tis the high intereſt, and great duty of every ſtate to adopt and purſue every practicable method of ſecuring, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging and extending to the utmoſt degree, all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and bleſſings which can reſult from ſuch public and private credit, and the mutual confidence of the ſubjects of the ſtate, in the public and in each other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE wiſeſt and richeſt nations of Europe, long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we were born, have ſeen this ſubject and its moſt momentous importance, in a light ſo ſtrong and glaring, as induced them to adopt every practicable method in their power, to ſecure to themſelves ſuch invaluable advantages.—In their practice we have an example, and in their ſucceſs we have encouragement, and very ſtrong inducement to imitate it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:020129_0006_0FADEC0F5E9D43D8"/>FOR this purpoſe the richeſt trading cities of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, long ſince adopted the plan of eſtabliſhing public banks; this plan they formed upon the moſt deliberate conſideration; they had the greateſt opportunities of information, had the greateſt experience in the ſubject; they knew the importance, operation and effects of both caſh and credit, the beſt of any men then in the world, as their trade and wealth were then the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of any in the world.—It is not to be ſuppoſed that their firſt eſſays reached the perfection of the ſubject, but they found advantages enough in their firſt trial, to induce them to continue the practice ever ſince.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Genoa</hi> was the firſt ſtate in Europe which eſtabliſhed a public bank; their bank of St. George was eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in 1407, by a public act of that republic. The plan was ſoon followed by <hi>Venice,</hi> whoſe bank, which continues to this day with the greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the ſtate, as well as to their private citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and has ever been in the higheſt reputation and credit both at home and through all Europe, was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by a public act of their ſtate. The city of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam</hi> long after followed their example, and their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent bank received a public eſtabliſhment by an act of their States-General, in 1609. The cities of <hi>Rotterdam</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh</hi> adopted the ſame practice; and England, who is always phlegmatic and late in adopting the example of the other European ſtates, inſtituted and eſtabliſhed its bank in 1694; and France, whoſe attention in thoſe days was little turned to improvements in trade, came later into it, their royal bank at <hi>Paris</hi> was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by public authority in 1718, beſides theſe, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many other banks of leſs extent and conſequence, both public and private, are now eſtabliſhed in the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding cities of Europe, and banks are become the great receptacles of the caſh of Europe, and almoſt all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile receipts and payments are made through them.</p>
            <p>THE bank of <hi>Genoa</hi> indeed fail'd in 1746, after that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:020129_0007_0FADEC10DB9C0610"/>
had for a great length of time enjoyed moſt ſignal and capital benefits from it, but its ruin was not brought on by any defect of its principle, or miſmanagement of its Directors, but by the madneſs of the rulers of that ſtate; they were not mad enough indeed to decry it as a uſeleſs or dangerous inſtitution, but they adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the contrary extreme, they magnified its ſtrength and power too much, and compelled the Directors to make advances to the ſtate, beyond what their funds would bear.</p>
            <p>THE other banks have continued to this day, and with ſuch incredible and moſt acknowledged benefit to the ſeveral ſtates in which they are eſtabliſhed, that their credit or decline has generally been conſidered as a ſort of ſure criterion of the ſtrength or weekneſs of the ſtate in which they are eſtabliſhed. When nations are at war, they ever have thought it a ſure way to bring on fatal embarraſsments on an enemy, if they can by any poſſible means ſhake the credit of their bank, and every ſtate has always been ready to go great lengths to ſupport their bank, if by any turn of affairs it has happened to be in diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>IT muſt therefore be very abſurd to ſuppoſe, that <hi>ſuch an inſtitution can be hurtful or even uſeleſs, that has ſtood the teſt of ſuch extenſive and durable tryal and practice, among ſo many nations of the greateſt experience, and moſt accurate knowledge of the ſubject</hi>; an inſtitution through which not only the caſh of private merchants, but of the greateſt and richeſt trading companies, and even the treaſure of nations, has been ſo long negociated, and which, through ſo great a length of time up to this very hour, ſupports its credit, and character of vaſt utility, by the univerſal ſuffrage of nations, thro' all ranks of people, from crowns and the moſt digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied aſſemblies of ſtateſmen, and the moſt wealthy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of merchants, down to the loweſt dealer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:020129_0008_0FADEC1123594930"/>BUT all this notwithſtanding people may be found little acquainted with the ſubject, and wholly unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in it, who will give their opinion <hi>that ſuch an inſtitution is injurious to a ſtate, and incompatible with the ſafety of it.</hi> This may be conſidered as an inſtance and proof of that height of abſurdity, which people may arrive at, who grow zealous and poſitive in things they do not underſtand.</p>
            <p>BUT however well the nature of banks may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood in Europe, and however immenſe the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and profits which are derived from them, may be, yet the thing is new in America, and by many people thought unfavorably of.</p>
            <p>THE BANK of <hi>North-America,</hi> though eſtabliſhed by act of Congreſs (December 31, 1781) which is the higheſt authority of the union, and recognized expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by many of the ſtates, and implicitly by them all, is nevertheleſs treated by many people here, as a moſt dangerous and injurious thing, utterly incompatible with the ſafety of the ſtate, and of courſe they think it ought to be demoliſhed without ceremony, and that the common forms of diſſolution are unneceſſary, as people are not very nice in the manner, or delicate in the choice of means of hunting down a beaſt of prey, or deſtroying a common enemy.</p>
            <p>BUT as I ſuppoſe my fellow-citizens will ever be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to hear before they condemn a thing that has once ſaved them, and very often afforded many of them a material convenience, I apprehend a ſhort diſſertation, ſhewing the nature of a bank, will not be unacceptable.</p>
            <p>A BANK <hi>is a large repoſitory of caſh, depoſited under the direction of proper officers</hi> (ſay a Preſident and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors) <hi>for the purpoſe of eſtabliſhing and ſupporting a great and extenſive credit, to be made uſe of in every caſe where an eſtabliſhed credit will anſwer in exchange or

            <p>THIS would be a public or ſtate-bank, becauſe the ſtock of it would be the money of the public, and the officers of it would be appointed by the public, i. e. by the General Aſſembly, or Preſident and Council.</p>
            <p>THE effect or operation of ſuch a bank, when its credit becomes eſtabliſhed (i. e. when the people at large believed with full confidence, that the fund or ſtock was ſufficient, and the management fair and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right) I ſay the operation or effect of ſuch a bank would be, that very few of the people who ſhould be poſſeſſed of ſuch bank-bills, would carry them into the bank, and receive caſh for them, becauſe the bills would anſwer by far <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>FURTHER ſuch bills would not only be as good as caſh for almoſt every purpoſe, where caſh is uſed or needed, but on many accounts they would be better than caſh, as any ſum of them is eaſier and more certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly counted than caſh; the danger of counterfeits would be leſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the carriage would be eaſier; they would be leſs

            <p>THE advantages would be ſtill greater, if inſtead of bank-bills, the owner ſhould take a bank credit, and draw checks on the bank, whenever he needed his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; this would enable him to pay any ſum exactly, without the trouble of making change, he would be able in any future time to prove his payments, if he kept his checks which he received cancelled from the bank, as every man ought to do; this would at once free him from all danger of loſs by fire, robbers, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying, dropping them on the road, &amp;c &amp;c. This practice is found by experience to be ſo very conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that 'tis almoſt univerſally adopted by people who keep their caſh in our preſent bank.</p>
            <p>THESE and many other advantages which bank-bills or bank credit have beyond what caſh can have, would doubtleſs induce moſt people to prefer bills or bank credit to caſh, and of courſe very few poſſeſſors of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would demand caſh at the bank, the conſequence of which would be, that at the end of the year much of the caſh would remain in the bank, though the whole amount of the bank-ſtock ſhould have been paid out in bills, and been conſtantly circulating among the people, with every advantage that caſh could have, and many other very valuable advantages that caſh could not have, as has been juſt now ſhown.</p>

            <p>BUT to purſue the matter further, I will conſider another inſtance, ſuppoſe a number of private citizens form a bank, each of whom puts in one or more ſhares, and raiſe in that way a bank-ſtock of any proper ſum, (ſay a million of dollars) for a fund to ſupport a large and extenſive credit, for the purpoſe of depoſits, loans and diſcounts, and appoint proper officers to manage the ſame, and obtain a public eſtabliſhment by a char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or other public act of the government; this will be <hi>a private bank,</hi> becauſe the ſtock of it is the money of private men, and the officers or directors are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by private ſtockholders, <hi>but it may in ſome ſenſe be deemed public,</hi> both on account of its extenſive utility and public importance, and the public patronage and eſtabliſhment it receives from government.</p>
            <p>THIS bank will have a nature and operation ſimilar to the other, and will afford the ſame kind of conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience to the citizens who choſe to be concerned in it, and in both caſes the particular profits of the bank will go to the ſtockholders, i. e. in the firſt inſtance to the public or ſtate, which is the great and ſole ſtockholder of it, in the other caſe to the private ſtockholders, whoſe contributions compoſe the ſtock.</p>
            <p>OF this kind is the BANK of <hi>North-America,</hi> and has a much greater capital (about mine hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dollars) than any ſtate bank can have in the preſent condition of our finances, and its operation, effects and uſes are much more extenſive, and its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodations to the citizens, and even to the ſtate, much greater than a ſtate bank could have; this may afford one anſwer to an objection which ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

public bank in its ſtead;</hi> another anſwer may be, <hi>that no plan of this ſort can be ſo ſure of a proper management under the ſtate, as it would be under the direction of its own proprietors.</hi> A bank is a ſort of mercantile inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, or at leaſt has ſuch a cloſe connection with the whole mercantile intereſt, that it will more naturally and properly fall under the direction of merchants, than that of any other ſort of men leſs acquainted with its nature and principles, and leſs intereſted in its ſucceſs. Another reaſon is, that a bank, whoſe ſtock is made up by the ſubſcription of private men, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged by the ſtockholders, is the ſureſt antidote or preſervative againſt tyranny in the government, that can be named; its owners are the rich men of the ſtate, who will never be concerned in needleſs popular cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours or ſedition againſt the government, but at the ſame time have both influence and inducement eno' to be a check and reſtraint on government, when it becomes oppreſſive, and really verges towards tyranny; the rich have an intereſt in their poor fellow-citizens, and (as ſome men uſe their wives) however tyrannical they may be themſelves, they will not ſuffer any body elſe to tyrannize over them. Trade and banks can't flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in a deſpotic government, and of courſe, where they do exiſt, they will keep deſpotiſm, as far as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, out of the ſtate. The ſtockholders are too nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, too much ſcattered, of ſentiments and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections too different, to admit any danger of becoming tyrants themſelves. I never heard an inſtance of a ſtate whoſe government was corrupted by its bank.</p>
            <p>BUT a ſtate bank, if we could poſſibly ſuppoſe that it would be well managed and grow rich, <hi>would tend immediately and directly to tyranny in the government,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would give the miniſter or ruler the command of a vaſt ſum of money; and I never knew a rich c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="6 letters">

               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:020129_0016_0FADEC1B966D8808"/>THE better way, I ſhould think, would be <hi>to join both together, ſo as that all the ſtate revenues may be paid into the bank, and all public payments be made by checks on the bank,</hi> and let the ſtate become ſtockholders as far as they pleaſe, and take ſums out of the bank to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of their ſtock, whenever 'tis neceſſary. This will anſwer every purpoſe of the ſtate as well as a ſtate bank, will increaſe the ſtock of the preſent bank, and, of courſe, extend the power and energy of it ſo much, that it will be able to ſupply the neceſſities of the ſtate with any loans of caſh, which (without the moſt violent convulſions) can ever be neceſſary; and, at the ſame time would be able to afford moſt ample accommodations to private citizens or companies, to the vaſt benefit and increaſe, not only of private for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, but of our trade, manufactures and huſbandry in general.</p>
            <p>THE preſent funds of the BANK of <hi>North-Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> or the caſh which ſupports it, is firſt, <hi>the bank ſtock,</hi> or the money paid in by the ſtockholders, which is about nine hundred thouſand dollars: And ſecond, the <hi>money depoſited</hi> by men of all deſcriptions, who may draw it out by checks on the bank whenever they pleaſe. Theſe ſums are variable indeed, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways very conſiderable, as no perſon ever draws checks beyond his depoſit, very few ever draw quite up, and very many people have large ſums there, becauſe their caſh lies in the bank, not only more ſecure, but is more convenient for payments there, than it could be in the keeping of its owner.</p>
            <p>SOME objections have been made to the preſent bank, which it may be proper to conſider.—1, <hi>ſuch vaſt ſums of money are hoarded up in the bank, that caſh is became ſcarce</hi> in town and country.

               <hi>A very great part of the bank ſtock, on the ſtrength of which the bank iſſues and ſupports the circulation it gives out, belongs not ot this ſtate or its neighbourhood, but to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who live in diſtant parts,</hi> to whom it muſt be remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted if the bank ſhould be broke up.</p>
            <p n="2">2. ANOTHER <hi>objection is, that monied men find a greater advantage in purchaſing bank ſtock than in letting their money on intereſt to people in the country, as formerly was done, and of courſe, though the monied men in town may gain by the bank, yet the country people ſuffer by it.</hi>— This is a ſtrange ſort of ſentiment to appear in form of an objection; becauſe, the bank inhances the value, or increaſes the uſe of caſh or any other property, ſo that the purchaſer is compelled to give more for it than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; therefore the bank is hurtful. The ſame cauſe (i. e. the bank) raiſes the price of wheat and flour, to the benefit of the country farmer indeed, but to the damage of the merchant in town, who muſt pay more for them than before; if our country produce was all conſumed in the ſtate, theſe miſchiefs and benefits would balance one another; becauſe, what one citizen loſt another would gain, but a very conſiderable part of our produce is exported and paid for by foreigners; and therefore the higher the price, the greater is the benefit to the ſtate.</p>
            <p>BUT this evil complained of <hi>does not originate in the bank,</hi> but in quite different cauſes, many monied men who uſed to lend money on intereſt, have loſt their money <hi>by the war, by the enemy, or by the depreciation of money, or by evaſions of payment</hi> which have been introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſince, and, of courſe, have no money to lend; and all that have any, have found the danger of letting it in the old way ſo great, that few will venter into it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and laſtly, the objection is hardly true in fact; <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe any man in the country who has credit enough in town to get a good indorſer, can have money out of the bank, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:020129_0018_0FADEC1D1513A140"/>3. ANOTHER objection to the bank is, <hi>that the diſcounts of the bank, make money of ſuch eaſy acquirement, that it induces merchants to overtrade their ſtocks, and diſſipating young fellows to ſpend money faſter, than they would do, if it was harder to get it.</hi> I believe this is all true, and not only ariſes from, but is an actual proof of, the great convenience and public utility of the bank: 'Tis juſt of the nature of all other objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a good thing, becauſe, it may be made an ill uſe of, and will prove that a good farm is worſe than a bad one, becauſe, it makes the farmer lazy, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as a little work on good land, will raiſe his bread; good victuals and drink are woſe than bad, becauſe gluttons and drunkards will eat and drink to exceſs; a loving wife is worſe than a croſs one, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, her huſband will be apt to lie in bed too long with her; and riches are worſe than poverty, becauſe they introduce luxury, &amp;c. &amp;c. But I can't be made to believe that bleſſings ought to be driven out of the ſtate, becauſe ſome people will make an ill uſe of them. I ſhall ever believe that 'tis eaſier living in a place where a man can raiſe a ſum of ready caſh on any emergency, without delay or difficulty, than where ſuch a thing can't be obtained without great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, trouble or perhaps ſelling property to great diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage for it. Such a facility is an advantage which I think is not to be deſpiſed, or eaſily parted with.</p>
            <p n="4">4. ANOTHER objection is, <hi>that all the benefits of the bank centre in the city, and near confines of it, but the country reaps no advantage from it.</hi> I anſwer, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this was true (which cannot well be admitted) as it coſts the country nothing, why do they begrudge the advantages of it to the city. I dare ſay the inhabitants of the city would all rejoice moſt heartily to ſee the country in full enjoyment of every advantage and co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

are, and the greater their trade, the better market they afford for the produce of the country.</hi> This is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular of capital conſequence to the country, for their huſbandry is animated and ſupported by their market; indeed the huſbandman and the merchant ever mutual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupport and benefit each other: And 'tis ſcarcely poſſible that either of them ſhould be benefitted or hurt, but the other will be affected by it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. ANOTHER <hi>objection is, that the great wealth of the bank will give it an undue influence on the government.</hi> There is no doubt but wealth creates influence; but 'tis that ſort of influence which has ever been found ſafe to the ſtate. Our bank is a ſort of mercantile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and the influence of merchants is the ſafeſt of any that can affect a government. The <hi>parſon</hi> lives on the <hi>ſins</hi> of the people, the <hi>doctor</hi> on their <hi>diſeaſes,</hi> and the <hi>lawyer</hi> on their <hi>diſputes</hi> and <hi>quarrels</hi> (and I ſuppoſe they all think they ought to pray for their dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bread) but the merchant lives on the <hi>wealth</hi> of the people. He never wiſhes for a poor cuſtomer or a poor country; the richer his cuſtomers are, the more they can purchaſe, and the better payments they can make to him. The merchant has every inducement to ſeek, and promote the wealth of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>WEALTH <hi>rarely begets ſedition</hi>; that baneful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction generally ſprings from <hi>poverty, vice, and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</hi> Theſe are the characters which find an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in fiſhing in troubled waters. We have perhaps no inſtance of a nation ruined by its merchants. I never heard of a ſtate diſtreſſed by its bank, but inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are plenty enough of ſtates ſerved and ſaved by their bank.—On the whole I think it abſurd to baniſh wealth from a ſtate for fear it ſhould gain <hi>too much influence</hi> in government, or <hi>generate faction</hi> in the ſtate; but of all kinds of wealth, <hi>a bank would be the leaſt likely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p n="6">6. ANOTHER objection is, <hi>that the general benefits of a bank depend on the integrity of the directors, who may, in many ways, by a corrupt or partial management deſtroy theſe uſes or make the whole ſtock of the bank ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the intereſts of a few favorites, and of courſe, the great body of the people muſt be excluded from the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of it.</hi> I anſwer, this is an objection that may be made with equal force againſt every inſtitution on earth, none of which are ſo good and beneficial, but their uſes may be leſſened or deſtroyed by corrupt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement; and when our directors are called upon to vindicate themſelves againſt any ſuch charge, it will be time enough to think of an anſwer: In the mean time the preſent internal ſtrength and good condition of our bank, demonſtrate that the management of the directors has been conducted with great prudence.</p>

time, but they form no concluſion againſt the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the bank or its natural utility. <hi>The ſame novelty of the thing prevented a general confidence in the bank at firſt among the people.</hi>—'Twas further unlucky, that the bank was firſt opened <hi>at a time when the people had ſo often been diſappointed and deceived in every ſpecies of public propoſitions and engagements relative to money, that they knew not who they could truſt</hi>; they heſitated leaſt they ſhould be taken in by the bank, as they had often been, by very numerous propoſals to which their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence had been courted.

            <p>THE directors, with much trouble, <hi>put a ſtop to this plan,</hi> by ſtrongly urging the fatal conſequences ariſing <hi>from two capital banks operating in one city,</hi> which might, perhaps, <hi>act in oppoſition to each other,</hi> and of courſe, deſtroy each other.

            <p>BUT the bank did not reſt long, for ſoon after this laſt mentioned difficulty ſubſided, there aroſe a pretty numerous party in the ſtate who adopted the <hi>ſcheme of paper money to be iſſued by our General Aſſembly.</hi> All the difficulty was to make it paſs equal to hard money, and they had little hopes of this, unleſs the bank would give it a currency, which every body ſee plain enough that the Directors could not do. The bank therefore and the ſcheme for paper money, were conſidered as inconſiſtent with each other, and one or the other, of courſe, muſt fall. The party for paper money determined at once, that the bank muſt be ſacrificed and united with all its other enemies, to decry it as an inſtitution <hi>injurious to the ſtate, and incompatible with the public ſafety.</hi> They raiſed (and declaimed upon) ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny objections to it, the moſt material of which (that I heard of) I have conſidered already in the foregoing pages of this eſſay.

               <hi>Queſtion</hi> 1. WHETHER <hi>Congreſs has a right to eſtabliſh a national bank, ſo as to make it ſuch a legal inſtitution as the laws of the ſtates of the union are obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge or recognize?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I ANSWER, this objection is grounded principly on the ſecond article of the confederation, viz. "Each ſtate retains its ſovereignty, freedom and independence; and every power, juriſdiction and right, which is not <hi>expreſsly</hi> delegated to the United States in Congreſs aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled." But the anſwer is eaſy, for, 1. A power of incorporating a national bank never did exiſt in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ſtates. They might erect banks, or any other corporation, and call them by what <hi>name</hi> they pleaſed, but their <hi>authority,</hi> like that of all their other laws, muſt be limited by the bounds of the ſtate, and could not extend beyound them. Nor,</p>
            <p n="2">2. DOES this act of Congreſs limit the power of any of the ſtates, they ſtill retain and may exerciſe every power, juriſdiction and right of incorporating banks, as fully as ever they had them: For, 3. the ſaid ſecond article of confederation, does not reſtrain Congreſs from having or exerciſing any ſovereignty, power, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction or right, whatever; it only reſtrains them from exerciſing it in ſuch manner as to deprive the ſtates of it. Notwithſtanding all the ſovereignty and power of Congreſs, they ſhall ever be ſo limited, that each ſtate ſhall retain its own ſovereignty, power, &amp;c. concurrent juriſdictions often exiſt together without the leaſt reſtraint of each other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE act of Congreſs incorporating the bank, <hi>is an act of finance,</hi> they conſidered it moſt expreſsly as a means, a very important <hi>means of finance,</hi> which is a branch of power that moſt undoubtedly falls within their authority or juriſdiction. They are not <hi>expreſsly</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="29" facs="unknown:020129_0028_0FADEC2958817BB8"/>
as all thoſe were neceſſary means of promoting the general intereſt, the liberties and general welfare of the ſtates, which are the grand and moſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged objects of the confederation, they are doubtleſs comprehended within its powers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE confederation (article 9) empowers Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to <hi>borrow money</hi> on the credit of the ſtates, and <hi>this certainly implies a power to find or procure ſomebody who will lend it to them,</hi> and this they effected to a great degree by incorporating the bank, which ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to a very large amount—They owed the bank, at one time 400,000 Mexican dollars, for money lent them by the bank, and all the monies lent at different times to Congreſs, and to the different <hi>departments</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their direction, amounted to above two million of Mexican dollars; and theſe loans were of ſuch capital and eſſential ſervice in that moſt deranged and weak ſtate of the public finances, that (in the opinion of thoſe beſt acquainted with the matter) the war could not have been continued without them.</p>
            <p>THE bank alſo lent at different times to this ſtate for its defence and other public purpoſes, above 130000 dollars, which certainly proves that the bank was very convenient to the public, and very neceſſary to the general welfare and general intereſt of it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt be comprehended in the powers granted to Congreſs, to manage the general intereſt, and ſecure the liberties, defence and general welfare of the ſtates.</p>

bills enough for that purpoſe, which would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate.—I apprehend I ſhall not be called on for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny proof of this; I therefore go on to infer, that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, who are expreſsly empowered to ſecure <hi>the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, liberties, welfare and general intereſts</hi> of the ſtates, are, of courſe, empowered <hi>to inſtitute a bank,</hi> which is ſo <hi>apparently and eſſentially neceſſary to all theſe great purpoſes</hi>—It follows then, that thoſe who oppoſe the bank, oppoſe the eſſential means of our defence, and, of courſe, lay us open to deſtruction, the firſt time any enemy ſhall invade our country.</p>
            <p n="5">5. IF we ſhould admit that there was a defect in the powers of Congreſs to incorporate the bank, yet <hi>that defect is amply ſupplied by the ſubſequent recognizance of the ſtates, their acquieſcence in the inſtitution, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation of the benefits of it for a courſe of years; for a ſubſequent conſent of the principal,</hi> is as good as <hi>a previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous order,</hi> to every purpoſe of eſtabliſhment or legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of any act of <hi>a ſubſtitute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ON the whole then, I conclude that the bank of North-America, by the ordinance of Congreſs for its incorporation, is a well eſtabliſhed and legal inſtitution, and as ſuch ought to be conſidered and recognized by all the ſtates, both in their laws and all judicial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, as far as the ſame may affect the ſaid bank.</p>

            <p n="2">2. THAT <hi>act implies the moſt ſolemn conſent of this ſtate to the aforeſaid ordinance of Congreſs, and carries in it further, the nature and energy of a ſolemn ſtipulation and compact</hi> of this ſtate with Congreſs, i. e. with all the ſtates, to ſupport that public meaſure of the union, with all the weight and authority which this ſtate could give to it, in all the particulars or clauſes mentioned or enacted in the ſaid law. The public and vigorous ſupport of the particular ſtates, gives great force to an act of Congreſs, though it might be conſidered as ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly legal without it, gives confidence in the public mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and is a good reaſon and ſtrong inducement to engage the public councils of the particular ſtates, as well as individuals, ſtrongly to exert themſelves and riſk their fortunes therein.

            <p>QUESTION III. What is <hi>the meaning, energy and effect of the act of this ſtate of April</hi> 1, 1782, <hi>incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the bank?</hi> I anſwer, 1. It carries in it <hi>the moſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic and full acquieſcence and ſatisfaction of our legiſlature in the act of Congreſs for incorporating the bank</hi>; becauſe it counts upon that act, without the leaſt cenſure, but with moſt apparent approbation of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT imports their approbation, becauſe they ſhew a readineſs to give it all the ſupport which the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this ſtate could give, and add to its eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the further ſanction of a charter of this ſtate, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the very words of Congreſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THOUGH, as I take it, this ſtate charter did not add any thing to the <hi>legality of the bank's eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under the charter of Congreſs,</hi> yet it ſerved to obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and ſatisfy the <hi>prejudices of many people,</hi> who had formed an opinion, that it would be ſafer to truſt their property in the bank, <hi>with</hi> a ſtate charter, than <hi>without</hi> one, and on that account <hi>withheld their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions till the ſtate charter was made.</hi> I never heard that any body, at that time, diſputed or called in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the legal authority of Congreſs to give a charter to the bank; but the public faith, plighted by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, relating to money, had been at that time ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and recently violated, that very little confidence was placed, by many people, in their public acts or reſolutions of any ſort, and therefore thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves more ſecure under a ſtate charter, than they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ould be under a charter of Congreſs, without ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ort: And this I take to be the true reaſon why <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he preſident and directors of the bank applied to our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

               </gap>bly for a ſtate charter, which manifeſtly removed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="33" facs="unknown:020129_0032_0FADEC3099CAC880"/>
faſter, and bank ſtock was more coveted after the ſtate charter was obtained than before; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I think it very evident that,</p>
            <p n="4">4. THIS act operated by way <hi>of ſtrong inducement and encouragement to very many citizens, as well as ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, to ſubſcribe to the bank, and truſt their property in it;</hi> and that the act was purpoſely made with intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that it might have this operation and effect, and therefore ought to ſecure the proprietors from any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, as far as the whole force of the act can do it; for certainly it cannot be juſtifiable in any ſtate to hold out encouragement to the people, to draw them into a ſnare, and then leave them in the lurch.</p>
            <p n="5">5. WHATEVER might be the effect of this act on the bank, by way of aiding the legality of its eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or giving it ſupport as a continental inſtitution, there is no doubt but it had this one perfect effect, viz. It incorporated the ſubſcribers to the bank into a legal company, and inſtituted a complete, eſtabliſhed, and legal bank of <hi>Pennſylvania,</hi> though by the name of the preſident, directors and company of the bank of <hi>North-America,</hi> for any ſtate may give what name or title they pleaſe to their corporations, though they can't extend their authority or privileges beyond their own juriſdiction. This act therefore undoubtedly brought the bank under the cognizance of the laws of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, and entitled the company, and every propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etor of it, to the full protection of theſe laws. Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this put them into any better condition than th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Can the act of 18th March, 1782, (making it felony to counterfeit bank bills, &amp;c.) and that of April 1, 1782 (incorporating the bank) I ſay, can theſe acts of right be repealed by our legiſlature, without conſent of the parties intereſted—I give my anſwer in the negative, and for this my opinion I beg the reader's candid attention to the following reaſons, which appear to me to deſerve great conſideration, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by thoſe who may not think them of ſufficient force to juſtify my concluſion.</p>

THE 2d great reaſon of this is, that <hi>the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of rights</hi> (which is part of the conſtitution of this ſtate) <hi>gives every citizen a right to be protected in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his property</hi>—It knows but two ways by which the ſubject can be deveſted of his lawful property. 1. By crime and forfeiture, and 2. <hi>By his own contract or conſent</hi>; if his property is challenged or demanded of him, in either of theſe ways, or any other way, let the controverſy be of what nature ſoever, reſpecting pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, he is entitled <hi>to a fair tryal by jury.</hi> (See arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles 8.9 and 11) This can be had no where but in a <hi>judicial court.</hi> The General Aſſembly are <hi>not ſuch a court</hi>—they have the <hi>legiſlative,</hi> but not the <hi>executive</hi> or <hi>judicial</hi> power of the ſtate; they can neither <hi>impannel a jury,</hi> or make a judicial deciſion <hi>without one,</hi> much leſs can they deprive any individual or company of ſubjects of any of their legal rights, intereſts, property or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, <hi>without any tryal,</hi> ſummons or examination at all, by any act or repeal of acts whatever, which they can make.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I TAKE it, <hi>that the declaration of rights is of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior authority to any act which the General Aſſembly can make, and will controul, and even render totally null and void any act of the aſſembly which infringes it, and will,</hi> and ought to be conſidered ſo <hi>by the judges of our court whenever the ſame may be pleaded before them</hi>: For, when two contradictory laws are pleaded before a court, 'tis impoſſible but the one or the other muſt be judged void; and if one of theſe laws appears to be grounded on a ſuperior authority to that of the other, there can be no doubt but the ſuperior authority muſt controul the leſſer.</p>
            <p>I CONSIDER the aſſembly as <hi>the mere creatures</hi> of their conſtituents, and acting merely by <hi>a ſubſtituted power</hi>; and the declaration of rights, I conſider as <hi>the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>CHARTERS (or rights of individuals or companies, ſecured by an act of the ſtate) <hi>have ever been conſidered as a kind of ſacred things,</hi> not to be vacated by a bare holding up a few hands, and ſoiling a page of paper, without any further previous or ſubſequent forms or ceremonies; but in all wiſe ſtates, have ever been conſidered as ſecurities of ſuch capital conſequence, that any attempts to deſtroy them have ever excited a general alarm, and have rarely happened but in times of great corruption of government and dangerous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of arbitrary power.—I think it, on the whole, very manifeſt, that a legiſlature, which for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable conſideration paid, has by public act <hi>ſold and granted certain valuable rights, privileges or intereſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> ſuppoſing the bank and all its operations could be broke up and entirely ſtoped on March 1 next, what would be the conſequence? 1. The great and uſual circulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of caſh (through which 37,000,000 dollars were negociated laſt year) would at once be ſtopped. 2. All diſcounted bills muſt immediately be paid or ſued, which would ruin very many, I think I may ſay, ſcores of ſubſtantial families; and their failures would occaſion, 3. A great loſs to the bank, and of courſe to the ſtockholders. And 4. The ſtockholders muſt lye out of their money till the bank accounts could be ſettled, which would probably be ſome years. 5. All the monies belonging to ſubſcribers out of the ſtate, muſt be carried out of it, as faſt as they could be collected; and 6. A moſt fatal wound would be given to our credit, as well as to all our trade, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very kind of buſineſs which depends on the circulation of caſh.—Who but an enemy would wiſh for ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, or promote the means of them?</p>
