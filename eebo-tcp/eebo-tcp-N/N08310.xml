            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>JOY and GLADNESS: A THANKSGIVING DISCOURSE, &amp;c.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>
                  <hi>ESTHER</hi> viii. 15.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>—And the city of</hi> Shuſhan <hi>rejoiced and was glad.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THAT we may rightly underſtand the occaſion of the joy and gladneſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in our text, it muſt be noticed, that a certain favorite miniſter with the King of <hi>Perſia,</hi> called <hi>Haman</hi> the <hi>Agagite,</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> enemy, who, it ſeems, by his being thus called the <hi>Agagite</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> enemy, was a reputed branch of the royal feed of <hi>Amalek.</hi> This favorite, by art and baſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuation, impoſed upon his maſter, King <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> to ſuch a degree, that he obtained a moſt cruel de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, to take away the lives and properties of the <hi>Jews</hi> in one day.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>A warning to Princes, not to truſt their favorites too far.</hi>
               </note> The requeſt and decree are as followeth: <hi>If it pleaſe the King, let it be written that they may be deſtroyed.—And the letters were ſent by poſts into all the King's provinces, to deſtroy, to kill,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010612_0004_0F80EEC158B9B258"/>
and to cauſe to periſh all</hi> Jews, <hi>both young and old, little children and women, in one day—and to take the ſpoil of them for a prey.</hi> Now when this bloody <hi>edict</hi> was publiſhed, there was (as well there might be) great diſtreſs among the <hi>Jews. In every province whitherſoever the King's commandment, and his decree came, there was great, mourning among them, and faſting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in ſackcloth and aſhes.</hi> In this critical hour, Queen <hi>Eſther,</hi> informed by her uncle <hi>Mordecai,</hi> of her own and nation's danger, (although uncalled) to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of her life, ſhe approaches the preſence of the King <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> and finds favor in his ſight. Thus the finger of GOD began to appear, in anſwer to the cries of the diſtreſſed <hi>Jews,</hi> which ſhone ſtill more by the ſignal bringing of <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s long neglected ſervice to the mind and notice of <hi>Ahaſuerus,</hi> in the moſt ſeaſonable hour, to pave the way for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and deſtruction of proud <hi>Haman,</hi> and ſure advancement of worthy <hi>Mordecai,</hi> to dignity and honor. Theſe things being done, at Queen <hi>Eſther</hi>'s ſecond approach and requeſt, for herſelf and her people, before the King, the <hi>Jews</hi> obtain liberty to defend their lives and properties. This was the ſingular occaſion that gave riſe to the joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the city of <hi>Shuſhan,</hi> the royal palace of the Kings of <hi>Perſia,</hi> as expreſſed in our text.</p>
            <p>LIKE to this, is the deliverance of <hi>America</hi> at this time, by the REPEAL of the <hi>Stamp-Act,</hi> in ſeveral regards.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE lives, liberties and properties of the <hi>Jews</hi> were expoſed to deſtruction—And ſo were the lives, liberties, and properties of the <hi>Americans,</hi> if this dreadful act, or decree, had not been repealed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT bloody <hi>decree</hi> given at <hi>Shuſhan</hi> the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, was obtained by a favorite—So 'tis thought that this odious act was procured by a favorite.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:010612_0005_0F80EEC20AC22298"/>
3. THERE was mourning and faſting with the <hi>Jews,</hi> in their diſtreſs—So there has alſo been with many ſober perſons in <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. IT was moſt evident, that GOD gave the <hi>Jews</hi> deliverance—In like manner it is evident, that GOD has given us our great deliverance, who turns all hearts, even as the <hi>King's, whither ſoever</hi> HE <hi>will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS by accommodating our text to our preſent times, we ſhall,
<list>
                  <item>I. MENTION ſome things, that ſhould excite us in <hi>America</hi> to joy and gladneſs, at this ſeaſon; not confining our diſcourſe merely to our late <hi>deliverances.</hi>

                  <item>II. POINT out how we ſhould rejoice and be glad on this occaſion.</item>
                  <item>III. NOTICE ſome fruits that ſhould attend our joy and gladneſs.</item>
               </list>

               <hi>Firſt.</hi> Mention ſome things, that ſhould excite us in <hi>America</hi> to joy and gladneſs, at this ſeaſon: not confining our diſcourſe merely to our late <hi>deliverances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HERE we have preſented in one view, heathen <hi>Shuſhan</hi> half buried in ſlavery; flowing with joy and gladneſs, to find the doomed <hi>Jews,</hi> by the unhappy <hi>Perſian</hi> conſtitution, only indulged and encouraged to arm themſelves for the defence of their lives and properties. And ſhall not <hi>we</hi> chriſtians and <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> feel an ardent flame of joy and gladneſs inſpire our hearts, when we ſee the <hi>fetters</hi> removed from our feet, and <hi>ſwords</hi> from our throats; and every thing dear to us, ſecured on its former baſis, by the <hi>repeal</hi> of the odious Stamp-Act? Thus to behold <hi>America,</hi> emerging from this dark cloud, that threatened to pour forth upon her an irreſiſtable torrent of miſeries, to the lateſt ages, is a view that moſt naturally does, and ſhould fill every true-born <hi>American,</hi> with joy and gladneſs, whilſt he diſcerns <hi>the ſnare broken, and his ſoul eſcaped.</hi> As no language can paint out what
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010612_0006_0F80EEC426F8CE80"/>
true ſons of <hi>America</hi> felt, and what they expected, in this night of tribulation, when their Sun of Liberty underwent ſuch an amazing eclipſe; ſo is it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, by words, to deſcribe the joy and gladneſs that does, on this occaſion, dilate the ſouls of this people; reaching the moſt remote corners, and with a ſtrange rapidity ſeize every rank of reaſonable beings, that either deſire or taſte freedom.</p>
            <p>AGAIN;—when we of this congregation remember the gloomy horror which covered our faces, and the anguiſh that filled our hearts, in the year paſt, under our then approaching dangers; and call to mind, that thoſe ſurrounding walls bear witneſs for us, that there we ſought the LORD in our diſtreſs, and lifted up our hands, with our hearts to GOD in the heavens for deliverance, as knowing that GOD ruleth among the inhabitants of the earth, as well as armies in heaven; this reflection cannot fail of ſwelling the tide of joy and gladneſs in our hearts, when now we behold ourſelves here aſſembled to praiſe GOD, and rejoice before him with thankſgiving, for the very deliverance we ſought at his hand. And this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally leads us to ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>I will praiſe thee, for thou haſt heard me, and art become my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> And with <hi>Solomon, He ſhall not much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the days of his life; becauſe</hi> GOD <hi>anſwereth him in the joy of his heart.</hi> This ſpring of joy ſhould not be eaſily forgotten.</p>
            <p>A FARTHER conſideration to excite and increaſe our joy and thankfulneſs to GOD, at this ſeaſon, ariſes from his kind care, as the great Governor in Providence, and bountiful Author of every bleſſing, who foreſaw all the miſeries and embarraſſments of poor and diſtreſſed <hi>America;</hi> under the decay and ſtop of her commerce, ſhutting up of the courts of juſtice, with a train of other evils, which ſtrangely ſtagnated all buſineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:010612_0007_0F80EEC4E79D6B20"/>
IN this period, GOD has ſhewed his pity and mercy, in giving ſo general health, and ſuch a plenty of the neceſſary fruits of the earth, by which, in the year paſt, our miſery and diſtreſſes have been much abated, and without which, in our other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, we had nigh been overwhelmed with miſery. Theſe are the tender mercies of our GOD, that call for joy and gratitude from every heart among us.</p>
            <p>STILL to aid our joy and gladneſs, at this ſeaſon, we recollect, that this is the happy day, in which the <hi>liberty,</hi> allowed by <hi>royal charter,</hi> of electing the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his Majeſty's council for this province, is to be exerciſed. This demonſtrates, that we yet are a free people, and have occaſion to rejoice in that privilege mentioned by the prophet—<hi>Their nobles ſhall be of themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT to crown all our joy and gladneſs on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and excite it to the higheſt pitch, we muſt ever remember, that in the name of the divine Saviour, there is publiſhed to the world, a <hi>REPEAL</hi> of the moſt amazing doom pronounced againſt ſinners. This is indeed worthy to be called <hi>glorious news,</hi> and the moſt ſweet and heart-refreſhing, that ever entertained mortal ears. Lo! ſuch meſſages echo from the Book of GOD, <hi>Thou ſhalt call his name</hi> JESUS; <hi>for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins. And behold the Lamb of</hi> GOD, <hi>which taketh away the ſins of the world.</hi> Still the ſoft ſound attracts our ears, GOD <hi>ſent forth his ſon, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that are under the law, that we might receive the adoption of ſons.</hi> And CHRIST <hi>hath redeemed us from the curſe of the law, being made a curſe for us. And the Angel ſaid unto them, Fear not, for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all people: for unto
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010612_0008_0F80EEC50E3E06D0"/>
you is born this day, in the city of</hi> David, <hi>a Saviour, which is</hi> CHRIST <hi>the</hi> LORD. Theſe are meſſages worthy of a ſeraph ſent from GOD! For what will it avail us, my brethren, to rejoice in the <hi>birth-rights</hi> of <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and account ourſelves happy in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from a late grievous <hi>burden,</hi> laid on our necks; whilſt in the next or preſent moment, we reflect and view ourſelves, ſervants to ſin, bond ſlaves to Satan, lying under the infinite burden of GOD'S wrath and curſe, and heavy yoke of a condemning law, haſting into the priſon of hell, and dark abodes of the damned, there to be reſerved in <hi>chains of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting darkneſs, to the judgment of the great day.</hi> Hence, the news of an eternal redemption by JESUS CHRIST, ſounding in the ears of fallen men, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be, indeed, the moſt noble and higheſt matter of joy and gladneſs, not only to <hi>America,</hi> but to the world; and infinitely exceeds all tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral deliverances or civil freedoms. 'Tis the ſaying of the Redeemer of men, <hi>If the Son therefore ſhall make you free, ye ſhall be free indeed.</hi> Let us then, inſpired with the hopes and lively expectations of living and reigning with CHRIST, and enjoying <hi>the glorious liberties of the ſons of</hi> GOD, indulge an holy freedom of ſoul, pouring forth our joy and gladneſs, in a ſort joining the heavenly high, ſaying, <hi>Glory to</hi> GOD <hi>in the higheſt, and on earth peace, good-will towards men</hi>—Longing for our arrival to thoſe peaceful abodes, where no bounds will confine, nor ſorrows diminiſh our joy and gladneſs, in perfect freedom, for ever and ever. But to proceed:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> We were to point out, how we ſhould rejoice and be glad, on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>IT is GOD, (<hi>who created all things, and upholds all things, by the word of his power,</hi> who alone is the ſupreme Governor of the world, and fountain of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010612_0009_0F80EEC5CD42BAC8"/>
being and perfection) in whom all intelligent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhould rejoice and be glad, and not in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. It is indiſputable, that the joy and gladneſs of holy angels, is peculiarly in GOD, as the force of all perfection and glory; and is excited by every diſcovery of theſe divine perfections and glories, in his works of creation, grace or providence, towards the univerſe of beings. It is therefore in GOD, through JESUS CHRIST, the divine <hi>mediator,</hi> that we, fallen men, ſhould rejoice and be glad, ſeeing 'tis only in him we are able to behold the divine glory, agreeable to that of the apoſtle, <hi>For</hi> GOD <hi>who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined into our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of</hi> GOD, <hi>in the face of</hi> JESUS CHRIST. Hence we learn from inſpiration, to rejoice in GOD, through our Lord JESUS CHRIST ſupremely. And thus ſpeaketh the prophet, <hi>I will greatly rejoice in the</hi> LORD, <hi>my ſoul ſhall be joyful in my</hi> GOD, <hi>for he hath clothed me with the garments of ſalvation.</hi> Again, another prophet, in a dark ſeaſon, ſaith, <hi>Yet I will rejoice in the</hi> LORD, <hi>and joy in the</hi> GOD <hi>of my ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> In like part <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh, <hi>But we alſo joy in</hi> GOD, <hi>through our</hi> Lord JESUS CHRIST. It behoves us, on this occaſion, therefore, to rejoice in GOD, through our Lord JESUS CHRIST, by whom every deliverance or mercy flows down to us; <hi>for ſalvation is of the</hi> LORD. Whenever mercy, good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or kindneſs appears, there we ſhould notice the finger of GOD, which juſtly leads us this day to rejoice in GOD ſupremely, as the alone giver of <hi>every good and perfect gift.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AGAIN:—If we would know how to rejoice with gladneſs acceptable before GOD, at this ſeaſon, it muſt ſpring from a divine faith, wrought in our hearts by the grace of GOD, which <hi>is the ſubſtance of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010612_0010_0F80EEC6F1D84100"/>
things hoped for, the evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> and agrees to that divine ſentence, <hi>Believing, ye rejoice with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory.</hi> Without the divine faith in the being, perfections and faithfulneſs of GOD, in the record he has given of his Son, all our joy and gladneſs is heatheniſh and abominable, as an empty noiſe diſpleaſing before GOD; for <hi>without faith, it is impoſſible to pleaſe</hi> HIM. Let us then <hi>take heed, brethren, left there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living</hi> GOD, in this the day of our joy and gladneſs.</p>
            <p>BUT ſtill to point out, how we ſhould rejoice this day before GOD, we ought to keep in mind, how variable human ſcenes are, not imagining that our mountain ſtands ſo ſtrong as never to be moved. Surely we have not ſo ſoon forgot the dark day, when the Sun of our <hi>Liberty</hi> ſet in a gloomy cloud, which, for a ſeaſon, boded perpetual night. Then our faces gathered paleneſs, whilſt we ſaw <hi>fair Liberty</hi> ſo ſuddenly fled from her former delightful abodes.</p>
            <p>THIS unexpected <hi>eclipſe</hi> of our darling Sun of Liberty, ſhould for ever impreſs our hearts with a feeling ſenſe, that all human things are uncertain. Here we may learn, to ſalute and embrace fair Liberty in her return, with a trembling hand, and jealous heart, left we provoke her to withdraw from theſe happy climes; for ſhe is ſo delicate and modeſt, as not to fit long in the proud <hi>lap of preſumption and ſecurity.</hi> Therefore we ſhould at this ſeaſon, accept that word of inſpiration, <hi>Serve the</hi> LORD <hi>with fear, and rejoice with trembling.</hi> And in the midſt of our joy and gladneſs, imitate <hi>Jacob,</hi> in his return from exile; <hi>I am not worthy of the leaſt of all the mercies, and of all the truth, which thou haſt ſhewed unto thy ſervant.</hi> In this humble, zealous and trembling manner, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010612_0011_0F80EEC75196B750"/>
with joy and gladneſs, may we now wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Liberty in her auſpicious return to theſe her pleaſant ſeats; and in ſuch arms may we retain her to the lateſt ages, as the offspring of GOD, ſent to bleſs this new world.</p>
            <p>To add farther, how we ſhould rojoice before GOD acceptably, on this occaſion; it naturally occurs, that we remember the poor, and make them glad and rejoice with us, by kind portions, after the ancient cuſtom of GOD's people on occaſions of ſingular joy. This will be <hi>an odour of a ſweet ſmell, a ſacrifice acceptable, well pleaſing to</hi> GOD.</p>
            <p>Now that we may cloſe this head of directions, how we ſhould rejoice and be glad before GOD, on this extraordinary occaſion, which, on many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts, far exceeds all that have gone before in <hi>Britiſh America;</hi> as the diſtreſs and awful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of danger and miſery had riſen, in general, much higher than ever was known in this land before, under her ſharpeſt trials, and moſt ſingular diſtreſſes, which have been many and great from the very beginning; ſo never did the hearts of all ſwell with grief, or expand with joy and gladneſs, as on this occaſion,—Therefore in the fulneſs of our hearts, we ſhould pour forth devout raptures of praiſe and thankſgiving to GOD on high, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneth over the kingdoms of men, who proclaimeth himſelf <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> He only <hi>is worthy to be praiſed, who doth great things, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable and paſt finding out.</hi> 'Tis the LORD our GOD who hath given <hi>us this great deliverance,</hi> in which we rejoice and are glad.—Therefore, with holy <hi>David,</hi> let our hearts and lips join, when he ſaith, <hi>I will praiſe the name of</hi> GOD <hi>with a ſong, and will magnify</hi> HIM <hi>with thankſgiving.</hi> In this ſort may our affections aſcend to GOD, in the chaunt of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010612_0012_0F80EEC817D40960"/>
praiſe this day, which <hi>ſhall pleaſe the</hi> LORD <hi>better than an ox or bullock, that hath horns and hoofs;</hi> yea, better than all the fire-works in <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. We were to notice ſome fruits that ſhould attend our joy and gladneſs, on this ſpecial oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
            <p>The ſupreme love of GOD, ſtands in the front of theſe fruits, which ſhould wait on, and flow from our joy at this ſeaſon. May we not juſtly imagine, that GOD is ſaying of <hi>America,</hi> on this occaſion, as he did of his <hi>Iſrael</hi> by the prophets: <hi>Surely they are my people, children that will not lie: ſo he was their Saviour. In all their affliction, he was afflicted, and the angel of his preſence ſaved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed them.</hi> And ſhall not ſuch thoughts, raiſe in our hearts, the moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent wiſh for the heavenly dove, to deſcend with balmy wings, and ſhed abroad in our hearts a ſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick flame of love to GOD; that we may give GOD our whole hearts in this the day of our glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And ſo ſhall we prove that we are children that will not lie, and manifeſt, that our hearts are right with GOD. When our ſouls breathe forth this language of <hi>David, I will love thee, O</hi> LORD, <hi>my ſtrength.—The</hi> LORD <hi>is my rock, and my fortreſs, and my deliverer.</hi> The LORD, in very deed, has been our ſtrength, rock, fortreſs, and deliverer in our late diſtreſſes, and in all our diſtreſſes. Hitherto we may ſay the LORD hath helped us.—And can we think of making any leſs return to him, than the higheſt affections of our ſouls? GOD forbid ſuch a thought.</p>
            <p>AGAIN:—The giving glory and honour to GOD, as the author of all, and particularly our late ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is a fruit neceſſarily connected with our joy this day. We have a divine injunction, <hi>Call</hi>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:010612_0013_0F80EEC8ED437A88"/>
               <hi>upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou ſhalt glorify me.</hi> We of this congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion have the comfort to recollect, that here we called upon GOD in our day of trouble, and he hath delivered us: Let us not then be wanting in glorifying HIM. But my brethren, whilſt I am urging you to give glory and honour to GOD, the ſupreme benefactor, from whom every bleſſing deſcends, I abhor the moſt diſtant thought, of diminiſhing our eſteem and veneration for our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious King, and noble Patriots, whom GOD long preſerve as extenſive bleſſings, not only to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and land, but to the world, and late receive them to eternal glory. Yet I think too much has formerly been ſaid, in our national ſucceſſes and deliverances, about miniſterial wiſdom, accompliſhed generals, and intrepid ſoldiers; even to the neglect of that honour and glory, which is due to GOD only, who furniſhes thoſe brave inſtruments with their ſhining talents, and raiſes them to power, and ſucceeds them in their noble enterpriſes for the good of men—As we ſeem to have fallen into this error formerly, we may eaſily diſcern like danger at this time, of robbing GOD of his glory, by aſcribing too much to men, who are but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, how excellent ſoever they may be. An inſpired King exhorts the grandees of the world in this language, <hi>Give unto the</hi> LORD, <hi>O ye mighty, give unto the</hi> LORD <hi>glory and ſtrength.—Give unto the</hi> LORD <hi>the glory due unto his name!</hi> To this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation may I not ardently wiſh, the mighty in our nation, land, and world, would do themſelves the honour carefully to attend. Then will they eſteem themſelves moſt honoured by thoſe, who honour GOD for them, and account it their higheſt glory to be inſtruments of glorifying HIM by whom
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010612_0014_0F80EEC991F73288"/>
               <hi>kings reign, and princes decree juſtice.</hi> Thus we ſhall be ſafe in paying all juſt honour to the inſtruments of our deliverance, whilſt we glorify GOD on their behalf. This fruit of honouring GOD, I hope will attend our joy and gladneſs on this ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>THE next fruit that preſents itſelf in view, as what ſhould naturally attend our joy and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for the preſent deliverance from ſlavery, is a ſerving GOD with freedom and delight of ſoul, running the way of his commands with enlarged hearts, who has delivered us from bondage and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. Does not GOD ſpeak to us of <hi>America</hi> in his providence, as once to <hi>Iſrael</hi> by his prophet? <hi>I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love, and I was to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws.</hi> Has not GOD done this latterly for us? And ſhall not we eſteem his ſervice our greateſt freedom; accounting his <hi>yoke eaſy, and his burden light? Being delivered out of the hands of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> let us <hi>ſerve</hi> GOD <hi>without fear, in holineſs and righteouſneſs, before him all the days of our life.</hi> For us now to live in the ſervice of our own luſts, and ſlavery to Satan, or in any diſobedience to the juſt and lawful authority over us under GOD, when we are rejoicing in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> freedom and late deliverance.—This is abſurd to the laſt degree, and well does merit, and juſtly might provoke an holy GOD, for ſuch baſeneſs and ingratitude, to doom us to eternal <hi>chains</hi> in hell, as delighting in ſlavery.</p>
            <p>THE laſt fruit we ſhall notice, that ſhould attend our joy and gladneſs on this occaſion, is a fitting and retaining on our ſpirits, a deep and grateful ſenſe of GOD'S, unmerited, mercy and goodneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us in our deliverance, ſo that we may not loſe the influence of it on our hearts and lives all our
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010612_0015_0F80EECAAC4E6840"/>
days;—left the weight of that charge fall upon us, as on <hi>Iſrael of old—They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy</hi>—Or that rebuke, <hi>they ſang his praiſe, they ſoon forgat his works.</hi> GOD forbid ſuch baſeneſs and trifling, ever to be found with us. But may a grateful ſenſe of our ſalvation abide in our hearts, and influence our lives whilſt we remember that we are reaſonable beings.</p>
            <p>Now we cloſe all with a few reflections. Here 'tis natural to view the opening ſcenes of joy, with a kind of divine pleaſure expanding our hearts into an extaſy, like that of the pſalmiſt, <hi>When the</hi> LORD <hi>turned again the captivity of</hi> Zion, <hi>we were like them that dream. Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with ſinging: then ſaid they, the</hi> LORD <hi>hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad.</hi> Thus the moſt ſurpriſing and marvelous proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, breaks in upon our eyes at this time; when but a few months paſt, a proſpect of blood and ſlavery both to ourſelves and poſterity, preſented itſelf in all its horrid deformity. The face of things are now changed, and the happy viſion of ſafety and <hi>Liberty</hi> entertains our eyes, and employs our thoughts, with inexpreſſible delight in the thoughts of living and dying free men, and leaving this freedom, as our beſt patrimony, to the ages yet unborn. What muſt be the ſatisfaction of ſuch reflections, when they receive the additional ſweetneſs which ſprings from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of JESUS CHRIST, <hi>into the glorious liberty of the ſons of</hi> GOD! This far exceeds all language, and ſwallows up all our thoughts as in a boundleſs ocean of goodneſs.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER reflection at this ſeaſon, may very well turn our caſe in a ſpecial manner, to give GOD the glory of our freedom, and not man: <hi>Not unto us,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010612_0016_0F80EECB3A854320"/>
O</hi> LORD, <hi>not unto us, but unto thy name give glory.</hi> This is becoming language, even for the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted monarchs on earth. Yet we find a ſtrange aptneſs in men, when admiring the noble inſtruments of their preſervation, to rob GOD of the glory due unto his name, and wickedly ſay, '<hi>tis the voice of a</hi> GOD, <hi>and not of a man.</hi> Although <hi>Herod</hi>'s worms demonſtrate the falſhood of ſuch a ſhout, and leave a warning for the moſt exalted princes, or ſhining orators, to give GOD <hi>the glory.</hi> From this ſin of robbing GOD of his glory, in this tranſport of joy that fills our land, may divine <hi>grace</hi> preſerve both us and our happy deliverers under GOD.</p>
            <p>TO add farther, GOD'S delivering us at this time, ſhould inſpire us with holy courage and confidence, in HIM, in all our dangers, and teach the ages yet to come, to <hi>fix their hope in</hi> GOD. Shall we not ſay, on this occaſion, GOD <hi>is our refuge and ſtrength, a very potent help in trouble: therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the midſt of the ſea?</hi> Let <hi>America</hi> never deſpair; but truſt in and cry to GOD, as her refuge and preſent help in trouble.</p>
            <p>BUT ſtill our reflections ſhould lead us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, we are this day before the LORD our GOD, in our joy and gladneſs. Therefore our joy ſhould be ſuch as becometh men and chriſtians; not the joy of beaſts and heathens—left if we cloſe this day with vain mirth, we ſhould provoke the eyes of GOD'S holineſs to ſend more wrath upon us, by which we may be utterly conſumed. Here, ſurely, while we are ſolacing our hearts with the pleaſure of deliverance, from perpetual ſlavery to men, it becomes us to feel a kind of holy indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſwell in our breaſts, at the thought of living in a moſt abject ſlavery to our own luſts, and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010612_0017_0F80EECBF9F73FA8"/>
being the willing captives of Satan. And does it not become <hi>Americans</hi> in general, and each of us in particular, to petition, with a greater union and importunity, the <hi>Majeſty of Heaven,</hi> for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from ſuch a ſpiritual ſlavery, than ever it did to petition his Majeſty on earth, from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from the moſt deteſtable <hi>Stamp-Act?</hi> Or can any thing leſs than a reſolution, never to be forgotten, burn in our hearts on this occaſion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining our ſouls, that by the grace of GOD, we will not jeſt or give over the ſuit, until we know the happineſs of being CHRIST's <hi>free-men?</hi> This will afford a pleaſure infinitely more exalted and raviſhing, than what now fills <hi>America</hi> with joy and gladneſs.</p>
            <p>Now let our reflections cloſe with an ardent wiſh, that <hi>America</hi> may be <hi>as a field which the</hi> LORD <hi>hath bleſſed,</hi> on which he will cauſe his heavenly dew perpetually to deſcend, where heaven-born Liberty ſhall for ever ſmile—All whoſe inhabitants, like their kindred ſpirit on high, may be inſpired with ſupreme love to GOD, and his Son JESUS CHRIST. Animated with this offspring of GOD, love divine, may unceaſingly give him the honour due unto his name—Aiming at the moſt univerſal obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, ſhall <hi>honour all men, love the brotherhood, fear</hi> GOD, <hi>honour the King</hi>—And continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the moſt grateful ſenſe of GOD'S mercy and loving-kindneſs towards them, by which they are indulged to dwell in tents of freedom on earth; and live in ſure hopes (by JESUS CHRIST) of ſhining in glorious manſions of perfect freedom with GOD in heaven for ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>
