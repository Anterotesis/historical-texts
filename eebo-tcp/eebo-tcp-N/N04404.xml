            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>RUTH is a very precious Jewel: Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in general it is ſo; but that which is emphatically called <hi>the Truth,</hi> is ſo more eſpecially: I mean that which is revealed to a ſinful and periſhing World, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to a Way of Salvation by a Redeemer; and which is indeed no other than the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>That was therefore good Advice of the wiſe Man, <hi>Buy the Truth, and ſell it not</hi>: And that was a very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Saying of the great Apoſtle, <hi>We can do nothing againſt the Truth, but for the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed there are many who are apt to make ſuch a Profeſſion, who cannot do it on ſo good Grounds as the holy Apoſtle did. But I remember a Saying of a very worthy Divine <note place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> John Robinſon.</note> to this Purpoſe,
<q>That when ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Perſons offer to prove by the Word of God what they ſay and maintain, we ought, in Honour to the
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:005439_0003_1018303ceb4024c0"/>
divine Oracles, to ſhew ſo much Regard to them, as to examine into the Truth of what they ſo offer to confirm.</q>
            </p>
            <p>However uncertain we may be with Reſpect to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Things, which we have a Call to take under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration; yet I think we may be very ſure of this, that the beſt and wiſeſt of Men, in their preſent lapſed State, <hi>know but in Part, and propheſy but in Part</hi>; and ſo had need carry themſelves very humbly in all their Eſſays for the Iveſtigation and Declaration of the Truth; and that the Truth being ſuch an invaluable Treaſure, as is above expreſſed, it ought not on any ſlighty Grounds to be parted with, and ſuffered to be loſt. We are therefore ſometimes called to <hi>contend earneſtly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints</hi>; and to be willing rather to ſuffer Reproaches, and other Evils, than that the Cauſe of Truth ſhould ſuffer thro' our Neglect. That is, in a good Senſe, a Truth concerning all Chriſtians, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially the Miniſters of CHRIST, who are <hi>ſet for the Defence of the Goſpel,</hi> and made <hi>Stewards of the Myſteries of God,</hi> viz. <hi>For this End was I born, and for this Cauſe came I into the World, that I ſhould bear Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the following Eſſay, whatever Cenſure I may fall under on the Account of it, I think it has not been raſhly undertaken, or engaged in; it being the Reſult of many Years ſerious Enquiry after the Truth; and I have in it endeavoured, in my poor Manner, to imitate the noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> who <hi>received the Word with all Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs of Mind, and ſearched the Scriptures daily, whether thoſe Things which they heard preached were ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="unknown:005439_0004_1018304148d39cf0"/>I have been from my Youth naturally inclined to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to underſtand what I believe; and why I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve this or that Propoſition to be true: And yet I very readily acknowledge, That when any Propoſition is evidently delivered in the Scriptures of Truth, I ought for that Reaſon to believe it to be true, tho' I cannot fully comprehend the ſame, and am not able to anſwer all Objections that can be made againſt it: But then I muſt be ſure that it is indeed delivered in the divine Oracles,—in which Caſe <hi>every Tho't ſhould be captivated to the Obedience of</hi> CHRIST.</p>
            <p>In the little Reading for which I have had Leiſure and Opportunity, I have been chiefly converſant in the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Calviniſts</hi>; yet I confeſs I have endeavoured not to be wholly ignorant of the Principles of thoſe who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace or incline to the <hi>Arminian Hypotheſis</hi>; and have always preferred the Former as much the beſt of the Two: So that I cannot juſtly be looked upon as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to overthrow the Firſt, and eſtabliſh the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This is what I do not at all intend; but what I endeavour is, to remove ſome Things out of the Way, commonly aſſerted by <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> which I think may be diſmiſſed from their Hypotheſis, being no Ways ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to the Support of the principal Articles in that Scheme; but on the contrary, render it the more difficult to be received and defended. And what I to this End advance, I humbly ſubmit to the Cenſure of the <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Judicious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is principally inſiſted on in this Eſſay, is, <hi>That the Offer of Salvation made to Sinners in the Goſpel, does compriſe in it an Offer, or conditional Promiſe, of the Grace given in Regeneration.</hi> I believe there is as
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:005439_0005_10183043fab42320"/>
really a conditional Offer of this made to ſinful Men, in the Goſpel of the Son of GOD, as there is of Pardon of Sin, Juſtification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In this I think I differ from moſt that are in the <hi>calvinian Scheme</hi>: And I confeſs I was for many Years otherwiſe minded; but while I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to defend what I then believed, the Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that offered themſelves to my Mind againſt what I had admitted as true, prevailed on me firſt to doubt of it, and by Degrees to receive the Doctrine I now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to defend: And if I make good what I aſſert, I think I do not therein diminiſh, but exalt GOD's Grace.</p>
            <p>I for ſeveral Years endeavoured in a more private Way to get Satisfaction in theſe Points, wherein I was fallen into a Way of thinking ſomewhat different from many others, before I entertained any Tho'ts of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing my Sentiments. I frequently diſcourſed with, and ſometimes wrote to learned Divines, concerning the Matters here diſcourſed of; and had, I think, no Matter of Conviction that I was under any Miſtakes; much leſs, that I had advanced any dangerous Errors. And I cannot deny but that ſome pious and learned Divines have ſpoken ſomewhat favourably of my Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, and have expreſſed their Willingneſs that I ſhould, by the Preſs, <hi>ſhew my Opinion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have in this Eſſay, endeavoured not to provoke or offend any Perſon whatſoever; and now profeſs, that I greatly reſpect and honour thoſe, whoſe Sentiments dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from ſome of mine, diſcovered in this Diſcourſe: And I have therefore choſen rather to argue on the Things conſidered, than meddle with the Perſons from whoſe Opinions I diſſent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:005439_0006_10183046d91065a8"/>And after all that I have ſaid for the Support of my own Hypotheſis, (in the Explanation of which I have endeavoured to be very <hi>free</hi> and <hi>open</hi>) I think I am fully reſolved ſeriouſly to weigh every Thing that ſhall be offered for my Conviction, according to the beſt of my Skill and Judgment; and I hope if I am in an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, my Fault is not unpardonable.</p>
            <p>I alſo hope, that if I am wrong in any of my Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I have taken ſuch Care to ſecure the fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Articles in the Doctrine of <hi>Grace,</hi> that Men's Souls will not be endangered by any Thing advanced in this Attempt to ſet ſome Things in a clearer Light than they ſeem to me to be ſet in, in ſuch Books as I have had Opportunity to rend; but it may be thro' my own Ignorance underſtand not.</p>
            <p>I have not in this Eſſay had any Deſign againſt the Doctrine of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> GOD's <hi>eternal Decrees</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> the Difference betwixt <hi>common</hi> and <hi>ſpecial Grace,</hi> and the <hi>Sovereignty of</hi> GOD in the Affair of Man's Salvation. For according to my Hypotheſis, as well as that I oppoſe, that is a great Truth maintained by the Apoſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Rom. ix. <hi>It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of</hi> GOD <hi>that ſheweth Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi>—. Theſe Things I not only allow, but occaſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally endeavour to defend; tho' this not being my principal Deſign, I have not much enlarged on them: But my main Deſign is that above expreſſed.</p>

                  <p>Who the Sinners are, and in what Condition, to whom Salvation is ſuppoſed to be offered in the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>To this then I ſay in general, That the Sinners here intended, are ſuch as all Mankind fallen in <hi>Adam,</hi> by Nature, are; or as conſider'd in that Eſtate, into which the Fall has brought them. I do not here
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:005439_0017_1018306e41b73968"/>
ſay, That the Offer of Salvation is made to all that are in this Eſtate; but that all unto whom the Offer of Salvation is ſuppoſed to be made, are of this Number; and ſuch an Eſtate as this they all, by their Fall and Apoſtacy from God, have been plunged into.</p>
                  <p>Now, that this is a very miſerable and wretched Eſtate, is by all <hi>Calviniſts</hi> acknowledged; and in this I fully agree with them; and ſhall endeavour, as briefly as I can, to ſhew wherein the Miſery of this Eſtate does conſiſt. And to this End, I ſhall here take a ſhort View of the Wretchedneſs of that Eſtate, into which Mankind have, by their Apoſtacy, brought themſelves.</p>
                  <p>To this End, the firſt Thing I ſhall obſerve, is, That the Sin of our firſt Parents in eating the forbidden Fruit, was exceeding great and heinous. It was a Sin againſt an expreſs and poſitive Command of God, immediately and plainly given to them by God himſelf, to which they were, on their Peril, required to yield Obedience, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. So that it was a Sin againſt Light and Knowledge, and a very preſumptuous Sin. It was alſo a Sin againſt the moſt endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcoveries of the Goodneſs of God to them. God had newly created them in his own <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Likeneſs,</hi> Gen. 1.26, 27. and in his Favour, with Dominion over the Works of his Hands; and had plainly enough, for them to underſtand, promiſed Life to them on Condition of their Obedience to him; tho' this Promiſe was only implied in the contrary Threatning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. They wanted not Power to keep this Commandment; but might have continued in their Obedience to it, if they had watched and prayed, that they might not have fallen into <hi>Temptation</hi>; and endeavoured to withſtand <hi>the ſame</hi>: This, I think, none will deny. They had no Need to eat of the Fruit forbidden them, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ving Plenty enough beſides, no other Trees in that rich and plentiful Garden being denied to them. They had no Need, nor Warrant, to ſeek after a better Condition, at preſent, than that they were in. They had, no doubt, before they had ſinned, enjoyed happy Communion with God, and one with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They had no Warrant to hold a Parly with the Serpent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to entice them from their Obedience and Allegiance to their Creator and ſovereign Lord; much leſs to believe him in what he ſaid, in direct Oppoſition to that God that cannot Lie; and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Conduct, in direct Oppoſition to the divine Command.</p>
                  <p>It was enough for them that God had created them in his own Image, in Reſpect of Knowledge, Righteouſneſs and Holineſs. They ſhould not have aſpired to have been more like God in Knowledge, than he made them, or rather to be equal to him, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.5, 6.
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:005439_0018_1018306fcff03b10"/>
Nor ſhould they have taken Part with the Devil to this End. Thus heinous was their Tranſgreſſion; and much more might here be ſaid. This is that Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> which is, by <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> ſuppoſed to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to his Poſterity, which I, at preſent, take for granted, but may conſider hereafter.</p>
                  <p>What I ſhall here next mention, ſhall be ſome of the immediate and neceſſary Effects, or Conſequents of this now mentioned heinous Sin: I mean ſuch Conſequents as follow'd naturally from the Crime com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, without any Conſideration of the <hi>Threatning</hi> denounced, in Caſe of Diſobedience: <hi>That</hi> ſhall anon be conſidered. Now this could not but produce extraordinary Shame and Horror, unleſs God had (which was not the Caſe) given up the Offenders to a moſt unaccountable Stupidity. I ſuppoſe God had a Deſign to make the Promiſe of the Seed that was to break the Serpent's Head, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. very welcome to them.</p>
                  <p>We may accordingly ſee what Shame and Confuſion of Face ſeized on them, Gen. 3.7, 8, 9, 10. <hi>And the Eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they ſewed Fig-Leaves together, and made themſelves Aprons. And they heard the Voice of the Lord God, walking in the Garden, in the Cool of the Day: And</hi> Adam <hi>and his Wife hid themſelves from the Preſence of the Lord God, among the Trees of the Garden. And God called unto</hi> Adam, <hi>and ſaid unto him, Where art thou? And he ſaid, I heard thy Voice in the Garden: And I was afraid; becauſe I was naked, and I hid my ſelf.</hi> Nor did the Shame or Confuſion which theſe Offenders were thus in, ariſe wholly, (if principally) from the Threatning that had been denounced; but very much, (eſpecially their Shame) from a Senſe of the moſt vile Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs whereof they had been guilty. This ſeems evident from the Queſtion God put to <hi>Adam,</hi> ver. 11. <hi>And he ſaid, Who told thee that thou waſt naked? Haſt thou eaten of the Tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou ſhouldſt not eat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So heinous was this Offence, which was by <hi>theſe</hi> committed, that they could not but be in great Horror on the Account of it; tho' they had tho't nothing of the Evil threatned againſt them. Nor could they have had any great Reaſon to hope for a Pardon, tho' they had never been threatned; and tho' they could not have known what Puniſhment God would have laid on them: And yet I acknowledge, there would not have been Ground for utter Deſpair.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore now come to conſider their Guilt, as this ſignifies an Obligation lving on them to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Virtue of that Sanction of the Law, <hi>In the Day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die.</hi> Guilt, I think, may be taken, either for a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's being truly chargeable with ſome Sin or Crime; and this the Perſons were, of whom I here ſpeak, of which before: Or it may be taken for that Obligation, by which the Offender is bound to ſuffer the Penalty due to him for his Offence; and this is that which I am here to conſider in the Caſe before me. What was intended by the Death threatned, I am not yet come to take an Account of; but the Nature of the Obligation, and the Conſequences thence ariſing, is what, at preſent, I am upon: And this is expreſs'd in ſuch ſtrong Terms in the Text mentioned, that the Offenders, I think, had no Grounds given them to hope that the Sentence might be reverſed. I mean, they had not, before <hi>the Seed of the Woman</hi> was promiſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. No wonder then that the Offenders were in ſuch a Plight as they were, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.11.</p>
                  <p>The Covenant of Works was doubtleſs given to be a ſtanding Rule, according to which God was reſolved to deal with Mankind; and by which he obliged himſelf to give them Life, in Caſe of conſtant and perfect Obedience to him, and aſſured them that they ſhould die in Caſe of the leaſt Failure or Diſobedience, as by comparing <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. with <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10, 12. and <hi>James</hi> 2.10. does appear. And God was pleaſed to try Man's Obedience in one ſingle Inſtance, before they had committed any other Offence againſt him. Now on this Trial, they moſt vilely forſook their Allegiance to him, and wickedly rebell'd againſt him: Which, having done, for any Thing that did appear, there was nothing to be expected, but the Execution of the threatned Sentence on them They were for the preſent bound over, as the fallen Angels were, with whom they had joined againſt God, <hi>unto the Judgment of the great Day</hi>; and had no Reaſon to expect any Thing better than what, in the Threatning, God had denounced againſt them.</p>
                  <p>The Day of their Probation was now ended, and the Covenant broken betwixt them and the great God, and no Repentance or Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was by that Covenant now requir'd of them: Nor had they any other Relation to it, than that of capital Offenders, doom'd to preſent Death by it: Nor was there yet any Way of Eſcape propos'd to them; nor, as far as did appear, any Room for God to treat with them, or they with him, on any Terms of Reconciliation whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>This was the State in which Mankind now were, and they doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs were ſenſible how Matters ſtood betwixt God and them; and they had Reaſon to be filled with Dread and Amazement, as it ſeems
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005439_0020_101830751d5dcab0"/>
they were. Nor had they any Room or Hearts to beg for a Pardon. What a terrible Condition was this? They were, in Reſpect of the Sentence pronounc'd againſt them, as dead Men, as ſoon as ever they had ſinned.</p>
                  <p>But the Miſery of theſe Tranſgreſſors will further appear, if we conſider what that Death was, which, by the Sanction of the Law, they were thus bound over unto. And this I ſhall now proceed to ſhew; only I ſhall here firſt obſerve, that the Death threatned againſt theſe Tranſgreſſors did not, properly ſpeaking, conſiſt at all in the Obligation they were under to ſuffer it. For tho' ſuch as are under a Sentence of Death, are ſometimes ſpoken of as dead Men, as was before obſerved; yet there is a Difference between Men's being under a Sentence of Death, and their actually dying; or betwixt a Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment paſſed on them, and the Execution of it: However, a Sentence of Death is very terrible.</p>
                  <p>And now I may, without any further Delay, ſhew what Death theſe Malefactors were by the Law of God ſentenced unto. I ſay then, <hi>theſe</hi> were, by the Threatning annexed to the Law of God, Sentenced to undergo a threefold Death, which I ſhall ſpeak ſomething concerning in the Order now to be expreſſed. And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>firſt</hi> Kind of Death intended in the Threatning, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly was that which we commonly call <hi>Death ſpiritual.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That Mankind are by Nature ſpiritually dead, the Scriptures abundantly teſtify: And for the clearing up of what I here aſſert, I ſhall ſhew (1.) Wherein this Death does conſiſt. (2.) That this came on our firſt Parents as a Puniſhment of their Sin, in eating the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Fruit.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1.) Let us conſider wherein this Death conſiſteth. Now to this I ſay, that this Death conſiſteth in the Loſs of the Image of God, which Man was created in, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.26, 27. or that Rectitude or Integrity, of which he was the Subject, when he was in that Eſtate wherein he was created. Eccl. 7.29. <hi>God made Man upright.</hi> This did not conſiſt in the Eſſence of Man's Soul; for if it had, he could not have loſt it: But it conſiſted in that habitual Conformity of the Soul to the holy Nature and Will of God, which was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created with it, and was the Bond of its Union with God, while Man enjoy'd it; <hi>for he that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit</hi> with him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. This was Man's Life, while he was in a State of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005439_0021_1018307732ccab50"/>
Innocency; and is ſo again, when he is <hi>renewed in Knowledge and Righteouſneſs after the Image of him that created him,</hi> Col. 3.10. Men deſtitute of it are ſaid to be <hi>alienated from the Life of God,</hi> Eph. 4.18. To be without this is Death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.6. This Principle of Life is in Scripture call'd <hi>the divine Nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. <hi>The Seed of God,</hi> 1 John 3.9. Thoſe who have it not, have not <hi>eternal Life abiding in them,</hi> ver. 15. but on the contrary, <hi>are dead in Sins, and in the Uncircumciſion of the Fleſh,</hi> Col. 2.13. When ſuch are ſaid to be dead; and when their Deprivation of ſuch a divine Principle is called Death; theſe Expreſſions are, I acknowledge, metaphorical; and the Metaphor is taken from the Likeneſs which there is, in ſome Reſpects, betwixt a proper Death and this. Men, in this Eſtate, being as uncapable of performing any Actions that are truly ſpiritual and holy, as Men naturally dead are of performing the Actions to which natural Life is required, Rom, 8.6, 7, 8. <hi>For to be carnally minded is Death: But to be ſpiritually minded is Life and Peace; becauſe the carnal Mind is Enmity againſt God: For it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the Fleſh cannot pleaſe God.</hi> 1 Cor. 2.14. <hi>But the natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God, for they are Fooliſhneſs unto him: Neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> This Death does not, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſpeaking, conſiſt either in Men's doing that which they ſhould not, or in omitting or neglecting that which they ſhould do; but in their Want of ſuch a Principle as is neceſſary to their doing that which is, in a ſtrict Senſe, holy and good; and in a right Manner avoiding to do the contrary, <hi>i.e.</hi> from a Hatred of it, and a Love to that which is good. This, I think, is too plain to need any Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Thus briefly of this Kind of Death.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2.) I am to ſhew, That this came on our <hi>firſt Parents,</hi> as a Puniſhment of their Sin, and that it belong'd to the Death threatned. I ſay our <hi>firſt Parents</hi>; for as yet I conſider not how their Poſterity became in this Senſe dead. That <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>his Wife</hi> were thus dead, immediately after they had committed their firſt and great Offence, I think to be an evident Truth. If they had remained habitually holy after they had committed their firſt Sin, they would certainly have carried themſelves far otherwiſe than they did. They would not have attempted to hide themſelves from God, as they endeavoured to do, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.8. In which they diſcovered much Atheiſm, and very wrong Thoughts of God, from whoſe Preſence it is impoſſible to hide, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.24. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.8,—12.) inſtead of lamenting and confeſſing their heinous Offence, and juſtifying God, as by the Law of their
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005439_0022_1018307a84146730"/>
Creation, (but not as a Covenant of Works) they were obliged to do. They moſt wickedly endeavoured to juſtify themſelves, and caſt the Blame of their Fall on the God that made them, ver. 12, 13. So that by this Carriage of their's, they gave Occaſion for ſuch a Reflection on them as that in Job 31.33. <hi>If I covered my Tranſgreſſion as</hi> Adam, <hi>by hiding mine Iniquity in my Boſom.</hi> Does it not now appear, that <hi>theſe</hi> had, immediately after their Fall, a very corrupt Nature in them? And indeed, if by <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt Offence all Mankind were made in this Senſe Sinners, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, and ver. 19. how can it be thought poſſible that he ſhould himſelf eſcape becoming ſuch an One, when he had committed that heinous Tranſgreſſion?</p>
                  <p>But we muſt a little conſider how this came to be the Conſequence of our firſt Parents committing their firſt and great Offence. And here I will ſhew, <hi>firſt</hi> negatively, from whence this did not ariſe; and <hi>ſecondly</hi> poſitively, what was the Cauſe of it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Negatively, I ſay, This did not flow wholly nor principally from the natural Influence of that Sin, which they had newly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. Tho' ſinful Actions naturally produce and increaſe an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination or Diſpoſition to ſin yet more; and if they be often repeated, they beget a ſtrong Habit, inclining the Tranſgreſſors to go on ſtill in their wicked Courſes, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.23. Yet the Sin of theſe Perſons could not alone utterly eradicate all pious Diſpoſitions out of their Souls. Sinful Actions diverſe Times repeated would ſcarce of itſelf have done this; much leſs could one ſingle Act of Diſobedience have had ſuch an Influence, if there had been nothing elſe in the Caſe; but <hi>Adam</hi> might, and it is very probable he would, this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, have bitterly bewail'd his Fall, and earneſtly begg'd the Pardon of it; and perhaps have obtain'd it, and then had grown more watchful and circumſpect in his after Converſation, as is often the Caſe of good Men now: But it was far from being thus with him: Sin had immediately Dominion over him, and reigned in him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wherefore,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Reaſon hereof was this, God having threatned he ſhould ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly die in the Day he ſinned; and being greatly provoked at him for the horrible Wickedneſs he had committed, (of which before) did imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately begin to execute the Sentence on him, which he was now fallen under: And this he did in the firſt Place, by utterly taking his holy Spirit from him; the Conſequence of which was, that he immediately, and without any poſitive Act of God, infuſing any ſinful
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005439_0023_1018308129c705c8"/>
Diſpoſitions into him, became a moſt vile Miſcreant; a Child of the Devil, full of all Wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider theſe Things following, it will appear that it muſt needs have been ſo. (1.) God had obliged himſelf by his Word immediately to ſlay him, if he ſinned againſt him, with this only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in his own Breaſt, unleſs a Mediator ſhould interpoſe to offer Satisfaction for his Offence, and reprieve him from preſent Deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We know certainly by the Event, that there was this Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the Apoſtle ſhews plainly, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26. that God could not in Juſtice have ſpared him, in any other Way. The Threatning was abſolute, and expreſs'd in the ſtrongeſt Terms; and was to be immediately executed. To imagine it only ſhew'd what the Crime deſerved, ſeems to me to be moſt vain. (2.) Man being in ſuch a State of Condemnation, it would not conſiſt with either the eſſential, or rectoral Holineſs of God, to hold any ſuch Communion with him, as he does, and will hold, with ſuch as are his Friends and Favourites. He was a Traitor againſt the King of Heaven, and by Law condemned to Death for his Crime. How can we now imagine, that God might, while he was under this Sentence, deal with him as with a Friend and dear Child, with whom he was at Peace, when yet he was under his Wrath. (3.) Yet it muſt have been thus, if <hi>Adam</hi> after his falling under a Sentence of Death, had remained a holy Man ſtill, being ſtill endowed with God's Image, tho' but in ſuch a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as the leaſt of Saints now are. If <hi>Adam,</hi> after his Fall, had had but a Spark of true Holineſs remaining in his Soul, he muſt ſtill have had holy Communion with the bleſſed God; and God with him: That muſt have ſtill been the Language of his Soul, in Pſal. 73.25. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but thee? And there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee</hi>: And of God, with Reſpect to him, it might have been truly ſaid, as in Pſal. 147.11. <hi>The Lord taketh Pleaſure in them that fear him.</hi> This cannot be denied to hold true with Reſpect to all ſuch as truly fear God. Now it was impoſſible that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have enjoyed ſuch Favours, while under a Sentence of Damnation. It followeth (4.) That our firſt Parents being fallen under a Sentence of Death, could no longer enjoy thoſe Influences of the Spirit of God, by which their habitual Holineſs might be preſerved; or, in other Words, they could not have remained <hi>Temples of the Holy Ghoſt</hi>; but muſt needs have been utterly and immediately deſerted by him. That muſt and did now befall him, which <hi>David</hi> ſo earneſtly depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, in Pſal. 51.11. <hi>Caſt me not away from thy Preſence: And take not thy holy Spirit from me.</hi> And being thus forſaken, they were indeed
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005439_0024_1018308369ab8e88"/>
no better than the fallen Angels, with whom they had joined in their Rebellion againſt the holy God. Being thus wholly dead in Sin, ſpiritually dead, they were in this Reſpect Veſſels of Wrath fitted for Deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>I deſire it may be here remembred, and laid up in our Minds, to be recollected and improv'd, That the ſpiritual Death, of which I have been ſpeaking, did not precede, or go before, that Sentence of Death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. but belong'd to the Death there threatned, as the Wages of Sin, even of <hi>Adam</hi>'s actual Tranſgreſſion, in eating the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden Fruit; becauſe from hence it followeth, that this Sentence of Death muſt be taken off from the Sinner, before ſpiritual Life can be again reſtored to him.</p>
                  <p>Before I paſs to the next Head, I ſhall here briefly obſerve, that as this ſpiritual Death did not properly conſiſt in <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, but was a Fruit of it; ſo neither does it properly conſiſt in thoſe actual Tranſgreſſions which Sinners in a State of Nature do commit; but is the Fountain from which they flow, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15.19. and <hi>Luke</hi> 6.43, 45, 46.</p>
                  <p>Let it be here alſo obſerved, that the Dominion which Man's ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Enemies had over him after his Fall, tho' compriſed or implied in the Death threatned to be executed on him; yet was it not properly Part of that ſpiritual Death, of which I have been now ſpeaking: But Man's firſt Sin, and the ſpiritual Death that followed thereon, was what has given the Enemies of Men's Souls, ſuch an Advantage as they have over all thoſe who are dead in Sin. Of the great Power of theſe Enemies over ſuch as are <hi>dead in Sins and Treſpaſſes,</hi> we have an Account, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2.2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.26. and elſewhere.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The ſecond Kind of Death mentioned, as threatned againſt our firſt Parents, in Caſe they eat the forbidden Fruit, was <hi>Death tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>: By which I underſtand Death, properly ſo called, <hi>viz.</hi> the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Soul and Body one from the other; of which Death we have a Deſcription in <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.7. That this Kind of Death was intended in the Threatning, we have Reaſon to think; for (1.) This is Death, in the moſt proper and literal Senſe of the Word, and ſo is moſt juſtly ſuppoſed to be here meant; there being no good Reaſon to be given to the contrary. (2.) This Kind of Death is expreſly mentioned in the Judgment God paſſed on <hi>Adam</hi> after he had ſinned, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. (3.) <hi>Adam</hi> did, and his Off-ſpring do, generally die this Kind of Death. (4.) Tho' all Men, without Exception, do not thus die, this does not prove, that <hi>Adam</hi> was not threatned with this Kind of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:005439_0025_10183085a108ae28"/>
Death; becauſe their eſcaping it may be ſuppoſed to be owing to the Interpoſition of a Mediator. I could give other Reaſons for this, if it were needful.</p>
                  <p>For the ſame Reaſon that ſome Men die not at all, <hi>Adam</hi> did not die as ſoon as he had ſinned, <hi>viz.</hi> the Interpoſition of a Mediator, to offer Satisfaction for Sin, and reprieve him from preſent Death, and this in order to his eternal Salvation.</p>
                  <p>I know many think otherwiſe, not underſtanding the Threatning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. as I do, but holding the Meaning to be, That <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould, as ſoon as he had ſinned, become mortal, grow ſickly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, and ſhould at laſt give up the Ghoſt; and I grant, that, as Things have been ſince ordered, with Relation to ſinful Men, this Expoſition ſeems to agree well with the Event. But we ought to diſtinguiſh betwixt the real Intention and Deſign of God, the Law-giver, and the true Meaning of his Law. The Queſtion here is not, What God really intended to do, in Caſe <hi>Adam</hi> ſinn'd? But, What muſt be done in Caſe the Threatning ſhould be executed according to the true Meaning of it? And conſequently, what <hi>Adam</hi> was to expect if he eat the forbidden Fruit?</p>
                  <p>Now there is no Queſtion to me, but that the Meaning of the Threatning was, That our firſt Parents ſhould immediately die a proper Death, in Caſe they ſinned; only God did not ſo threaten this, as not to leave Room to have the Execution delay'd, in Caſe of the Interpoſition of a Mediator; yea, and to have it finally remitted, in Caſe full Satisfaction ſhould be given for the Offence. This has been made evident in the Event: But for all this, the true Meaning of the Law might be, That <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould die in the Day he ſinned, with the Exception only now expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>And it is certain, that this is the moſt proper and literal Senſe of the Threatning, in the Place referred to, and ſo what we ought not to recede from, unleſs by ſome urgent Neceſſity we are compell'd to it; which I hope I ſhall make it appear, that we are not, when I come to ſpeak of the Imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt Sin to his Poſterity; and ſhew how they partake of the Guilt, and become liable to the Puniſhment of that great Offence; which Doctrine, I ſuppoſe, the Hypotheſis I here proceed on, is no Ways inimical unto; but that it does, on the contrary, greatly favour it. I therefore now proceed to ſhew,</p>
                  <p n="3">
                     <pb n="11" facs="unknown:005439_0026_1018308b39e146a8"/>3. What the third Death was, which <hi>Adam</hi> was threatned with, in Caſe of Diſobedience: And to this I ſay, That eternal Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in another Life and World was doubtleſs intended in the Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: For which I give the following Reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Since Life eternal was by Promiſe engaged to him, in Caſe of Obedience, ſuch a Promiſe being implied in the Threatning denounced; ſo that <hi>Adam</hi> was to have enjoy'd poſitive Happineſs, and that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, on the mentioned Condition; it ſeemeth not reaſonable to think, that an eternal Puniſhment of Pain and Grief was not intended in the threatned Death: For thus the Evil threatned had not, in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Duration, been commenſurate with the Good promiſed. That, in the Threatning of Death, a Promiſe of Life was implied, will not, I ſuppoſe, be denied: And this Life muſt needs have been the ſame, or a better than that which <hi>Adam</hi> then enjoy'd in the <hi>Garden of Eden,</hi> which none can deny to have been a Life of poſitive Happineſs. Had <hi>Adam</hi> continued in his Obedience, he would have been greatly deceived, if he had ever been deprived of that Happineſs, and not had a greater given to him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A Suppoſition of <hi>Adam</hi>'s not being in a miſerable State, after this Life, having ſinned, and being deprived of all Happineſs, neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily implieth the Mortality of his Soul. For unto what End ſhould he be continued in Being, if he were to be neither happy nor miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable? And how inconſiſtent is this with the Nature of a rational Being, capable of Happineſs, and deſirous of it? For ſuch an one to be without it, muſt needs be a Torment to him. Therefore, to deny that <hi>Adam</hi> muſt have been miſerable after this Life, is, in effect, to deny, that his Soul ſhould have ſurvived, when his Body ſhould have returned to the Duſt; as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. and <hi>Eccl.</hi> 12.7. Now, if <hi>Adam</hi>'s Soul was mortal, why not other Men's too? Contrary to <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.28. and <hi>Luke</hi> 16.22.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Scriptures, by oppoſing that Death, which is the Wages of Sin, to Life eternal, do ſufficiently intimate to us, that that Death is eternal; ſo in Rom. 6.22. <hi>The Wages of Sin is Death; but the Gift of God i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> eternal Life.</hi> Now, can there be any Reaſon to queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whether <hi>Adam</hi> was to die ſuch a Death? Was not the Death threatned againſt him, the Wages of a moſt vile Tranſgreſſion? The Death which he was to die, was doubtleſs the ſame which thoſe are freed from, who believe in Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. The Seed of the Woman, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.16. was doubtleſs promiſed to ſave <hi>Adam</hi> and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005439_0027_101830918737b3b8"/>
others from this Death, call'd <hi>the Wrath to come,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.10. <hi>Jeſus which delivereth us from the Wrath to come.</hi> The ſame is called <hi>the ſecond Death,</hi> Rev. 20.6. Should not <hi>Adam</hi> have died this Death as well as others, if he had not been redeemed by Jeſus Chriſt? Is not this Death included in that which entred into the World by <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt Offence; <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. And if ſo, was not he himſelf liable to it? No doubt it was the ſame with that everlaſting Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which the damned are ſent into, Matth. 25.46. <hi>Theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting Puniſhment; but the Righteous into Life eternal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having now conſidered the woful Effects and Conſequents of our firſt Parents firſt and great Tranſgreſſion, as theſe related to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, perſonally conſidered; I ſhall now proceed to conſider them, as they related to their Children or Off-ſpring. And here, I take it for granted, (and do my ſelf believe, as in the ſhorter Catechiſm of the Aſſembly of Divines at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi>) That,
<q>the Covenant being made with <hi>Adam,</hi> not for himſelf only, but for his Poſterity, all Mankind proceeding from him, by ordinary Generation, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in him, and fell with him, in his firſt Tranſgreſſion.</q>

                  <p>Now here I might have concluded the firſt Chapter, in this firſt Part of my Eſſay; (my Deſign in it not being to prove thoſe Things wherein I and others with whom I therein have to do, are agreed) but becauſe of the great Importance of the Doctrine aſſerted, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Influence, Men's different Apprehenſions about it will neceſſarily have on their Principles, concerning ſeveral other Points of Religion, I ſhall endeavour to give my Readers ſuch an Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this great Truth, as I apprehend to be moſt agreeable to the Oracles of God, and, as I think, will have a Tendency to remove ſome of the Prejudices, which the Minds of many are apt to fill'd with againſt it; but will endeavour to ſay Nothing but what will be co-incident with it.</p>
                  <p>And in the firſt Place, I ſuppoſe the Covenant, in theſe Words referred to, is that of Works, made with Man, while he was in a State of Innocency; and that this is the ſame that God made with our firſt Parents, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. wherein he forbid them <hi>to eat of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, on pain of Death</hi>: In which Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Death, there was a Promiſe of Life, in Caſe of Obedience, plainly implied. God was pleaſed in this Precept or Prohibition to try Man's Obedience to him, as in a particular Inſtance; and in his Tranſgreſſion of this, that was verified, Jam. 2.10. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one Point, he is guilty of all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="unknown:005439_0028_10183093346f0110"/>
                     <hi>Adam, i. e.</hi> Man, with whom this Covenant is ſaid to have been made, was not <hi>Adam</hi> only, as that Name is ſometimes ſtrictly taken for the Perſon of the firſt Man, but for <hi>Adam,</hi> or Man, taken col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively, <hi>i. e.</hi> the whole Species of Mankind, Male and Female, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28. <hi>Job</hi> 28.28. <hi>Eve</hi> therefore rightly underſtood her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be included in it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.2, 3. Thus, tho' <hi>Adam</hi> was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally ſpoken to, yet it really did include his Poſterity alſo; and there was the more Reaſon that it ſhould do ſo, becauſe the whole Species of Mankind did then exiſt in the two Perſons, with whom at firſt it was more immediately made. The Perſons of their Off-ſpring did not then, indeed, perſonally ſubſiſt, but the whole human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and all that was eſſential to it, did; and ſo all thoſe that were by God's Command and Benediction to be propagated in the Way of natural Generation, by or from our firſt Parents. <hi>They</hi> have Nothing in them but what eſſentially belong'd to <hi>theſe.</hi> They are only <hi>Adam</hi> multiplied, according to God's Ordinance, above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. And <hi>Adam</hi>'s Children being of the ſame Nature and Make as he was, would undoubtedly have done as he did, if they had been put on the ſame Trial.</p>
                  <p>But I do not ſay, that <hi>Adam</hi>'s Off-ſpring being in this Senſe in him was that which conſtituted him their legal Head and Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative. It was their being comprehended in the Covenant that did this; and that they were ſo appears by their being made Sinners by <hi>Adam</hi>'s one Offence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12,—19. If <hi>they</hi> had not been intended in the Threatning, as well as our firſt Parents themſelves, the ſame Death had not come on them for the ſame Offence, as it plainly appears it did; tho' it was the more congruous that they ſhould be comprehended in the Covenant becauſe they were <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity, and he their natural Head; yet that they are affected, as they are, by his Sin and Fall, does immediately ariſe and flow from their being comprehended in the Covenant, as they moſt certainly were.</p>
                  <p>It appears from what has been now ſaid, That <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity were in him in a two-fold Reſpect. (1.) They were in him in a natural Senſe, as Branches are naturally in their Root or Stock, before they grow out of it. (2.) They were in him in a relative and moral Senſe, as he was their appointed Head and Repreſentative: And I acknowledge, that without being in him in this latter Senſe, they could not have ſinned in him and fallen with him in his firſt Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. And this is the Reaſon why Children now are not charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the Sins of their immediate Parents. God has not appointed their immediate Parents to be their moral Head or Repreſentative.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="14" facs="unknown:005439_0029_10183095e7ef53e0"/>The Covenant being thus made with <hi>Adam</hi> for his Poſterity as well as himſelf, he virtually repreſented them, before they actually ſubſiſted; ſo that his Carriage, before they had, in this Senſe, any Being, would affect their Perſons as ſoon as they ſhould exiſt. And ſince he repreſented none, but what were in the Way of natural Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to deſcend from him, none could partake with him in his Guilt, and the Death threatned, 'till in this Way they had a Being: And conſequently, if it had ſo fallen out, that none had ever been bro't into the World, in the Way mentioned, then none ſhould ever have ſuffered any Pain or Torment, in Caſe of his eating of the forbidden Tree; becauſe ſuch Suffering ſuppoſeth the Exiſtence of the Perſons ſuffering: And the ſame will hold with Reſpect to the Reward of his Obedience, had he not ſinned: His Poſterity having the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it, did neceſſarily ſuppoſe, that, in order to it, they muſt firſt exiſt.</p>
                  <p>Now Things ſtanding thus, betwixt the bleſſed God and Mankind, before <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall; and <hi>Adam</hi> having then Power to have continued in that State of Integrity, wherein he was created; and being liable withal to fall from it, by eating the forbidden Fruit, ſo, that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Nature of ſecond Cauſes, either of theſe might come to paſs, and one or the other of them would certainly do ſo: We may briefly conſider the Effects or Conſequents of each of theſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Events; but muſt here conſider theſe with Relation to that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant which Man was then in, without any Relation to the Covenant of Grace made with Man after his Sin and Fall; and thus we ſhall ſee how Things muſt have been, in either of theſe Caſes, had no Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor been provided.</p>
                  <p>And here firſt let us ſuppoſe, that <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood and not eaten of the forbidden Tree. When I here make this Suppoſition, by <hi>Adam</hi>'s continuing in his Obedience, I mean his having done ſo during that Time which God had allotted for the Trial of his Obedience to that poſitive Ordinance of his; on <hi>Adam</hi>'s Obſervation of which, his own and his Off-ſpring's Happineſs did depend: But how long a Time this was to have been, I cannot determine. God did not, in the Covenant made with <hi>Adam,</hi> limit any certain Time for this, but kept his Mind to himſelf: Only we know, that in Caſe of Sin, the Time was out as ſoon as it ſhould be committed. But how long Man muſt have continued in his Obedience, before he ſhould, on the Terms of that Covenant, have had a Title to Life, I cannot ſay: But I think it is very probable, that if <hi>Adam</hi> had not fallen before he
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005439_0030_1018309ae1687998"/>
had any Iſſue, God would not have permitted his falling into that Sin afterwards. For, on this Suppoſition, it ſeems, that ſome of his Off-ſpring would have been born in a State of Sin and others not, (ſhould he have had any after his Fall) which, I think, would not agree with the great End which God aimed at in this whole Affair, of which we have an Account, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.19. and moſt plainly in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. <hi>God hath concluded them all in Unbelief, that he might have Mercy on all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to me it is not at all improbable, that if our firſt Parents had endured that firſt Shock, by which they fell into Sin, God would have confirmed them in a State of Innocency, and not have ſuffered another Aſſault to be made on them. I know of no Reaſon to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that he would not have done thus; and that, on this Suppoſition, <hi>Adam</hi> and his Off-ſpring would have been happy for ever.</p>
                  <p>It is here ſuppoſed that if our firſt Parents had not ſinned, they would have had a Poſterity in the World. That Command and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nediction of God given to them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28. will not admit of the leaſt Doubt of this: And that, on this Suppoſition, <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity ſhould none of them ever have ſeen Death, I think unqueſtionable. Nor do I imagine, that they would all have lived in this little World forever; but ſuppoſe it more than likely, that after they had for a Time <hi>ſerv'd their Generation by the Will of God,</hi> they would have been tranſlated into the heavenly World, as <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. 5.24. Heb. 11.5.2 Kings 2.11.</note> were, and as the Saints that ſhall be alive on the Earth, at the ſecond Coming of our Lord <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Theſ. 4.17.</note>, will be.</p>
                  <p>Thus far have I conſidered how it would have fared with <hi>Adam</hi>'s Off-ſpring, on Suppoſition of his keeping the firſt Covenant; I ſhall now conſider what the Effects and Conſequents of his breaking that Covenant muſt have been, according to the Tenor of it; and if a Mediator had not interpoſed to offer a Price of Redemption for theſe Offenders: Of which more afterwards. And to this I muſt ſay, that I am fully of Opinion, that in this Caſe the Tranſgreſſors muſt have been immediately ſlain. Judgment muſt have been ſpeedily executed on them, there being no Reaſon or Room for delaying it.</p>
                  <p>I am ſenſible, that in this I differ from many wiſe and learned Men, whoſe Opinion is, that the Threatning denounced <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. did not intend that the Offenders ſhould immediately ſuffer a temporal or proper Death; but that they ſhould immediately become frail and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005439_0031_1018309cc0c77680"/>
mortal; and ſhould in the Time appointed by God, give up the Ghoſt. But, premiſing all due Regards to thoſe from whom I differ in this, I ſhall ſay ſomething to each of theſe Hypotheſes, that we may the better judge which of them is moſt agreeable to the Scriptures and the Diſcoveries we have of the Mind of God in them.</p>
                  <p>And firſt, with Reſpect to what I hold, I have theſe Things to ſay.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That what I plead for ſeems much better to agree with the plain Senſe of the Threatning, than that which I diſlike. The Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is very expreſs and poſitive on my Side, and the Terms uſed very ſtrong and emphatical. <hi>In the Day thou eateſt thou ſhalt ſurely die,</hi> or, <hi>ſhall die the Death.</hi> Now I have already ſhewed, that a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral or proper Death is intended in the Words, as well as a Death ſpiritual and eternal. And all the Kinds of Death intended were, without Exception, by the Words of the Threatning, to be inflicted on the very Day in which the Crime was committed. Nor have we any Liberty or Licence given us to leave, or recede from, the plain and literal Senſe of God's Word, unleſs by ſome urgent Neceſſity we are compell'd to it. This was the ordinary Senſe in which the Word <hi>Death</hi> was uſed, when <hi>Moſes</hi> wrote the Hiſtory of Man's Creation and Fall, and no doubt long before that Time. Nor is there any Reaſon to doubt but that <hi>Moſes</hi> would uſe a Word to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Thing intended in the Threatning, in the ſame Senſe that God did therein uſe it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By <hi>Adam</hi>'s Carriage after he had tranſgreſſed it ſeems that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected preſent Death. When <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> had ſinned, they were afraid, and hid themſelves among the Trees of the Garden, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. ver. 8, and 10. They acted like Perſons that expected to be ſlain as ſoon as they ſhould be taken; and no doubt they did ſo. And it is not to be queſtioned, but that they underſtood the Meaning of the Threatning.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That God did not immediately execute theſe Malefactors, is no Argument at all, that the Sanction of the Law did not intend it, any more than that the Law againſt High Treaſon does not intend that a Perſon committing that Crime, ſhall be put to Death for it; becauſe the King is pleaſed to reprieve and pardon him. We may well diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the Meaning of the Law and the Intention of the Prince, whoſe Law it is. The proper Senſe and Meaning of that Law, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. might be, That our firſt Parents ſhould die a
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005439_0032_101830a2252c7ac0"/>
proper Death, on the very Day they ſinned; and yet upon the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of a Mediator to offer Satisfaction for their Crime, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their being reconciled to God, they might be reprieved from the preſent Stroke of Death, and might, inſtead thereof, have Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of Peace propoſed to them. Thus God might be gracious, and ſay, <hi>Deliver them from going down into the Pit; I have found a Ranſom,</hi> as in Job 33.24. and this I believe was the Caſe. It greatly favours this, that God would paſs no Sentence on our firſt Parents, after they had ſinned, 'till he had firſt promiſed a Saviour, <hi>the Seed of the Woman</hi> that was to <hi>break the Serpent's Head</hi>; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15,—19. Had it not been for this, theſe Tranſgreſſors muſt have had quite another Sentence paſſed on them, <hi>viz.</hi> a Sentence of preſent Death and eternal Damnation.</p>
                  <p>Some have objected againſt what I here plead for, That, on this Hypotheſis, the World had at once been deprived of all its humane Inhabitants, tho' it was made for the Uſe of Mankind: And I readily acknowledge this to be true, and know of no Abſurdity implied in it; for if it had been ſo, God could eaſily have provided others to fill up the Room of thoſe Wretches, who, for ſinning againſt him, had been deſtroy'd.

                        </note>) could have deſtroyed <hi>Adam</hi> after his Sin, and made another Author of Generation of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</q>
But he never intended it ſhould come to this. He knew how to ſave the Offenders from that preſent Deſtruction which they deſerv'd; and to ſuffer them, in the Way which he had before pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to them, to repleniſh the Earth with Inhabitants, tho' this was not the Intention of the Threatning before mentioned, in Caſe <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned before he had any Iſſue; and ſo could not have been done if a Way to ſatisfy the Law had not been found out.</p>
                  <p>The Suppoſition which I have endeavoured to defend, being allow'd to be a Truth, as I think it ought to be, it will from thence follow, That if our firſt Parents committed their firſt and great Tranſgreſſion before they had any Children, as they certainly did, then no Poſterity of theirs could, according to the Tenor of the Covenant of Works, ſuffer any Pain or Torment, on the Account of their firſt Offence, in eating the forbidden Fruit. The Reaſon of this is obvious, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they could not have any. If they had none before they ſinned, beſure they could have none afterwards, being to die on that very Day,—I ſay, this follows, according to the Tenor of the Covenant of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005439_0033_101830a4338fc888"/>
Works, and ſuppoſing the Threatning annexed to that Covenant had been executed on the Perſons of the Tranſgreſſors, according to the genuine Senſe and Meaning of it. For otherwiſe they might have, yea, actually had, a numerous Iſſue, and theſe all bro't into the World in a State of Sin and Death, as I ſhall by and by ſhew; and by what Means this came to paſs, with the Advantages of allowing that this was brought about in the Way here intended.</p>
                  <p>But, before I come to this I ſhall obſerve, that tho' <hi>Adam</hi> could not, on this Suppoſition inſiſted on, have had an Off-ſpring to ſuffer poſitive Pain and Torment on the Account of his firſt Sin; yet he might, by tranſgreſſing the Covenant he was then under, hinder an Off-ſpring, which he ſhould otherwiſe have had, from enjoying very great and good Things, which, had he not ſinned, they might and ſhould have enjoyed. Our firſt Parents were by Nature, capable of propagating their Kind, and had not only God's Allowance, but Command and Benediction to that End, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.28. and if they had continued in their Obedience to God, they would moſt certainly have had a large <hi>Off-ſpring</hi> in the World, all of which would have been brought into it in a very happy Eſtate, as I have before ſhewed. Now, by their Sin, they at once hindred both the Being and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all <hi>theſe,</hi> conſider'd with Relation to the Covenant of Works. And thus <hi>theſe</hi> were great Looſers by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, (if I may ſpeak of Not-Beings, as is uſual, in ſuch Language as we ſpeak of Things that do exiſt) They were Looſers, I ſay, by being hinder'd from co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the World, and that in ſo happy a Condition, as they muſt and would have come into it in, if the Sin of <hi>Adam</hi> had not prevented it. And tho' they could not have complained of this Wrong, if they had never been; yet ſince they are bro't into the World by Means of the Mediation of the Son of God, they can ſee and complain of the Injury done them by their firſt Parents, in hindring them from being born in a State of Innocency and Happineſs.</p>
                  <p>By what has been ſaid it appears, That <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity were, according to the Tenor of the Covenant of Works, much affected one Way or other by his Carriage or Behaviour while he was in a State of Probation. If he had not ſinned, he would have had an Off-ſpring who would have been exceeding happy: But by ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, he excluded them (as well as himſelf) from that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which otherwiſe they muſt and ſhould have enjoy'd. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented them from living a happy Life in this World, and from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heirs of everlaſting Glory in the World to come. Our firſt
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005439_0034_101830a615e12a70"/>
Parents did, by their firſt and great Offence, virtually cut off all their Off-ſpring before they were born. As theſe virtually ſinned in them when they ſinned, ſo they had virtually died in them (a proper Death I mean) if they had died; tho' the Threatning of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works had been executed only on the Perſons of thoſe who actually tranſgreſſed.</p>
                  <p>Having now briefly conſider'd my own Hypotheſis, with the Effects or Conſequents of it; I ſhall proceed a little to examine that which ſtands in Oppoſition to it, <hi>viz.</hi> That our firſt Parents were not, according to the Tenor of the Covenant of Works, to be immediately put to Death, in Caſe they ſinned; but were, according to the Nature of that Covenant to be permitted to live ſome Time in the World (tho' a very frail and troubleſome Life) and to propagate a numerous Iſſue of ſinful Creatures like themſelves, and theſe all to be brought into the World in a State of Sin, being full of all Enmity and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, mere incarnate Devils; and being with thoſe evil Spirits joined in their Rebellion againſt the King of Heaven; being alſo with them in utter Deſpair of any Mercy from God, <hi>bound in Chains of Darkneſs to the Judgment of the great Day</hi>; and yet going on to propagate their Kind, great Numbers ſtill dying to make Room for more ſuch Wretches as themſelves, 'till the whole Number of <hi>Adam</hi>'s ſinful Off-ſpring ſhould be filled up, and then all of this Race, not one excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, our firſt Parents with all their Poſterity, at the final Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſent away into everlaſting Torment with the Devil and his Angels, as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.46. But obſerve, that this ſuppoſeth that there had been no Redeemer provided; and that God had dealt with Man according to the Tenor of the Covenant of Works.</p>
                  <p>And let it be here conſider'd, that on this Suppoſition, this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Deſtruction of all the Poſterity of <hi>Adam</hi> muſt have been wholly owing to that one Offence of his, in eating the forbidden Fruit; which yet theſe Sufferers could no Ways have poſſibly prevented, or have ſaved themſelves from the Guilt of, for they, in their own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, neither did nor could give their Conſent to the Terms of the Covenant made with their great Progenitor; nor could they hinder his ſinning as he did, or any of the woful Conſequences of his ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo that the whole would have been, as to them, unavoidable.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe it will not be denied, that this muſt have been the Caſe of all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity, on the Suppoſition which I call in queſtion. Now this is to many a very great Stumbling-block, or Matter of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005439_0035_101830aae81b97e8"/>
Offence; and tho' what is by <hi>Calviniſts</hi> offered in Defence of it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves ſerious Conſideration, yet I am inclin'd to think, that the Imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt Offence to his Off-ſpring may be better defended on the Hypotheſis which I have advanced, than on that which I am not well ſatisfied with: And therefore I have choſen that which I endeavour to defend; and will eſſay a little more fully to clear it up.</p>
                  <p>I take it for granted, That the Covenant of Works was, in the Nature of it, a very gracious Covenant, a Covenant in which the Goodneſs of God was very greatly diſcovered; and ſo a Covenant the Juſtice whereof might be vindicated againſt all Objections that might poſſibly be made againſt it, tho' God had inſiſted on the Terms of it, without abating one Jot or Tittle of its Demands, or admitting a Sponſor to make Satisfaction on Behalf of the Offenders againſt it; and therefore that Courſe in which this may be beſt done, and the Honour of God's Juſtice and Goodneſs moſt clearly and eaſily vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, I think to be the moſt eligible, Care being ſtill taken that this be not attempted in any Way inconſiſtent with any other divine Truth whatſoever. Now this I hope, the Way I have taken is ſuited to; and that I may further ſhew that it is ſo, I will mention ſome of the happy Conſequences following on what I plead for.</p>
                  <p>But before I do this, I think it needful to ſhew, what does not follow from it, at leaſt that one Thing does not, which perhaps ſome may ſuſpect does, I mean that it does not follow, on the Suppoſition for which I plead, That <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt and great Offence is not imputed to his Poſterity. Could I think that ſuch a Conſequence would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low on it, I ſhould not eaſily admit it.</p>
                  <p>Tho' it be maintain'd to be a Truth, that according to the Tenor of the Covenant which God made with <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 2.17. his Off-ſpring (if he ſhould have any) were to ſuffer Death, as well as himſelf and his Wife, in Caſe of his ſinning in eating the forbidden Fruit; yet this notwithſtanding it might be a Truth, that, according to the Tenor of that Covenant, our firſt Parents were to be put to Death, on that very Day in which they ſinned, tho' that ſhould fall out, as it did, while they had no Iſſue. It is certain by the Event, that our firſt Parents were liable to ſin before they had any Children: And I think it alſo evident, that God did not any Ways oblige himſelf by his Word, to give them a Poſterity, in Caſe they ſinned before they had Iſſue: Nay, on the contrary, I think it evident from what has
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005439_0036_101830acb68b8fe0"/>
been ſaid before, that they were to die on the very Day in which they ſhould eat of the forbidden Tree. Now if this be granted, it will not follow from it that if a Way were found out to redeem theſe Offenders from preſent Death and Damnation, ſo that they might live and have an Off-ſpring in the World, that then the Children pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from them, after they were become guilty, and their Natures depraved by Sin, ſhould not be involved in the ſame Sin and Death, which they themſelves were involved in. This, I ſay, will by no Means follow, on the Suppoſition mentioned. If they proceed from <hi>Adam,</hi> in the Way of ordinary Generation, they muſt ſtill, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Tenor of the Covenant made with him for himſelf and Off-ſpring, (if any he ſhould have) be brought into the World in a State of Sin and Death, the Condition he was in after his Fall.</p>
                  <p>Having now ſhew'd what does not follow on the Hypotheſis pleaded for, I ſhall proceed to ſhew what does follow from it.</p>
                  <p>And,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It plainly followeth from what I would have granted, That none had ever ſuffered any Pain or Torment, for Man's firſt and great Tranſgreſſion, had the Threatning denounced in the Covenant of Works, been, in it's utmoſt Rigour, executed on the Breakers of it, but only thoſe who perſonally ſinn'd in eating the forbidden Fruit. This Conſequence is moſt evident; becauſe, if that Sentence of Death had been executed on <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> according to the true Senſe and Meaning of it, on the Day wherein they ſinned, there could not have been any others to bear the Puniſhment with them, there being none to ſuffer beſides themſelves: For theſe ſinning before they had any Iſſue, muſt needs, according to the Tenor of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant they were under, have died without any Iſſue as before. I know God the great Law-giver, did not intend it ſhould be thus; the Event ſhews the contrary: But this, for ought any thing I can yet ſee, was the meaning of the Threatning in the Covenant; ſo that the Tranſgreſſors of it, could juſtly expect no other, on their breaking of it; and I ſuppoſe they did not, tho' God found out a Way to ſpare them. It is therefore, I ſuppoſe, a Miſtake, tho' many have fallen into it, That if there had been no Mediator provided, to undertake the Work of Man's Redemption, there would have been many Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of People, beſides <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> who only perſonally tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed the firſt Covenant, who muſt have ſuffered the Vengeance of eternal Fire, for their Sin, in eating the forbidden Fruit: They could have had no Poſterity to have ſuffered, if no Mediator had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="22" facs="unknown:005439_0037_101830af22c605f8"/>Therefore,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It plainly followeth, on the Hypotheſis inſiſted on, That all the Poſterity of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> are obliged to our great Mediator for their very Being in the World. Had not a Mediator interpoſed, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a Reprieve for our firſt Parents, they muſt have been put to Death on the very Day in which they ſinned; and then none of their Off-ſpring could ever have had a Being. They might, and doubtleſs would, have had a numerous and happy Iſſue, had they not ſinn'd; but by ſinning againſt God while yet they were without any, they forfeited the Bleſſing of Poſterity, yea forfeited their own Lives, and muſt have died Child-leſs, if the Son of God had not undertaken to be a Redeemer, born of a Woman, and made a Sacrifice for them; and then we, who are now their Off-ſpring, ſhould never have ſeen the Light, but ſhould have been, as it were, cut off before we had any perſonal Subſiſtence, tho' virtually we did exiſt in theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in whom the whole humane Nature was then compriſed: So that if they had been immediately cut off, we had virtually been cut off in them, as virtually we ſinned in them, while perſonally we did not exiſt. It is therefore manifeſt, on the Suppoſition inſiſted on, that we are all beholden to Jeſus Chriſt, as Mediator betwixt God and Man, for our very Being and Subſiſtence on the Earth. Had it not been for his Undertaking to be a Saviour, we ſhould never have been.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It further followeth, on the Hypotheſis here inſiſted on, That our firſt Parents, and all their Poſterity, did, by Means of the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of a Mediator to redeem and ſave them, immediately become Subjects of his mediatorial Kingdom. Mankind had, 'till then, been held faſt under a Covenant of Works, to be dealt with according to the Tenor of that Covenant; but now the Son of God, (having been appointed a Mediator fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Eternity) was promiſed to be a Saviour, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. and ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>cree was declar'd, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.7. and his Undertaking this glorious Work reveal'd; and began to have its proper Efficacy, he being <hi>the Lamb</hi> virtually <hi>ſlain from the Foundation of the World.</hi> Not that Mankind were hereby immediately diſcharg'd from the Guilt of Sin, and entitled to eternal Life; for they remained ſtill ſubject to the Penalty threatned in the broken Covenant of Works, 'till ſomething might be farther done for them, purſuant to the menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Undertaking of the Redeemer. But what I intend, is, that they immediately became rightful Subjects of that Kingdom which the Son of God had, as Mediator, committed to him, and which he was afterwards to deliver up to his Father, as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.24. It was by paying the Price of Man's Redemption, that our Lord obtained ſuch
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005439_0038_101830b5676b08b0"/>
a Right to rule and govern all thoſe, by his Laws and Ordinances, who are the Objects of his Purchaſe: And all the Laws given to Mankind ſince the Fall, are properly the Laws of the Mediator, by him given to them, the Price of whoſe Redemption he undertook to pay, and in due Time did ſo, according to his Covenant with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: And according to theſe Laws of his, he actually governs the World, bleſſing and rewarding the Obedient, and puniſhing the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, as is in the holy Scriptures abundantly declared. As for the Covenant of Works, that being once broken, Mankind ſtood in no other Relation to it than this, that they muſt undergo the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatned in it, unleſs in ſome Way conſiſtent with the Tenor of it, they might obtain a Diſcharge therefrom. God never after the Fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> propos'd the Covenant of Works to ſinful Men, as a Way in which they might obtain eternal Life; tho' he has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times given them a Repreſentation of the Nature and Tenor of that Covenant, that he might convince them how impoſſible it is to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Happineſs by Obedience to it, as in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10,—12. Yet ſincere Obedience to the moral Law is required in the new Covenant, and is, according to the Nature and Tenor of it, neceſſary to Man's Happineſs: <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.14.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It followeth, on the Hypotheſis for which I plead, That all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Off-ſpring are bro't into the World in a ſalvable Condition. In ſuch a Condition, I mean, as that, in a Way conſiſtent with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice, and the Tenor of the firſt Covenant, they may be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſaved. Nor do I intend this in ſuch a Senſe only, as wherein the ſame may be verified concerning ſinful Mankind, before (if I may ſo ſpeak) a Ranſom was found for them, becauſe it was in the Power of God to find out and provide a Way for their Salvation; which, if he could not have done, no Sinner could ever have been ſaved.</p>
                  <p>But I here intend to ſpeak of a nearer Capacity of Salvation, on the Account of a Price already paid or promiſed to be paid, for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. For by the ſame Means that our great Mediator procured a Reprieve for fallen Mankind, that they might not, on their ſinning againſt God, be immediately deſtroy'd, he alſo made Way for their eternal Salvation, <hi>i. e.</hi> by paying a full Price for their Redemption, a Price every Way ſufficient to anſwer the Demands of the Law, and to ſatisfy God for the Injury done to him: And whereas the Price was not immediately <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>id down when Man firſt ſinned and broke Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God; the Security given for the Payment of this Price,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:005439_0039_101830b95c15c9f0"/>
was ſuch as the bleſſed God was as well ſatisfied with, as if the ſame had been immediately and actually paid. There was no Occaſion to ſeek any farther for a Ranſom or Atonement for the Sin of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Any Man might now be ſaved, without any other or further Price of Redemption; and there was now a Foundation laid for a Treaty of Peace betwixt God and ſinful Men; and ſuch Terms might now be propos'd to them, as they complying with, might be juſtified and ſaved, without doing any Injury to God's Juſtice, as the Apoſtle fully declareth in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26. Thus much Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> and many of our Engliſh Divines of great Note, and not ſuſpected as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> have granted and maintained, as I can ſhew if Occaſion call for it. And leſs than this cannot reaſonably be allow'd to be intended in ſuch Texts of Scripture, wherein the Extent of Chriſt's Death, with Relation to the Object of it, is aſſerted; as in <hi>John</hi> 3.16. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.9. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14, 15. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.6. and <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5.18, 19.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It followeth from the Premiſes, That all <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity are brought into the World in a far better Eſtate, than that of Not-Being. Tho' I agree not with them who think that a State of end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Torment is better than that of having no Being at all; yet I prefer a State of Salvability from a State of Sin and Death, which ſuch as may be ſaved are at preſent ſuppoſed to be under, to that of Not-Being. Suppoſing I am not yet paſſed from Death to Life, and that I am not certain that I ever ſhall; yet ſince there is a Way found out, in which I may be ſaved, <hi>i. e.</hi> not only delivered from Sin and Death, but alſo obtain an exceeding and eternal Weight of Glory, I ſhould be loth to change my preſent State for that of having no Being at all. And Perſons capable of propagating their Kind, or of being Inſtruments of bringing Children into the World, may very reaſonably deſire to multiply their Kind, tho' they are perſuaded that all that proceed from them, in the Way of ordinary Generation, will come into the World in a State of Guilt and Corruption; nor do I ſee that God does any Wrong, in bringing <hi>Adam</hi>'s Poſterity into the World, tho' they do and muſt come into it (if at all) in a State of Guilt and Pollution, as has been expreſſed, ſince it is better for them to be, tho' in ſuch a Condition, than to have no Being: Which will yet more fully appear by the Sequel of this Eſſay. We may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, without any Inconvenience, allow unto <hi>Arminians</hi> that which ſome of them affirm, <hi>viz.</hi> That it will not ſtand with the Juſtice of God, to bring Mankind into the World in a worſe State than that of Not-Being.
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:005439_0040_101830be505b4950"/>
I know of no Advantage that any of the Enemies of the Grace of God can make of ſuch a Conceſſion as this is.</p>
                  <p>But it may be here objected, That <hi>to be a Sinner ſeems to be a worſe Eſtate than that of having no Being. We had better have no Being at all, than to be in a State of Sin and Enmity againſt God, ſuch as all Mankind are by Nature in, or as they come into the World, if the Doctrine of original Sin be a true Doctrine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, That thus to ſay is to beg the great Thing in queſtion. It ſeems that a wiſe and holy God has thought otherwiſe. If he, in his infinite Wiſdom, had not ſeen it <hi>better</hi> that all Mankind ſhould, by his Permiſſion, fall into a State of Sin and Death than not, why has he permitted them to fall into that Eſtate? And if it had not been better for us to <hi>exiſt,</hi> tho' in a State of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Miſery,</hi> rather than <hi>not</hi> to come into <hi>Being</hi> at all, why did he give to fallen <hi>Adam</hi> a <hi>Poſterity?</hi> when he might very conſiſtently with the Covenant and with Juſtice have inſtantly cut him off before he had any Iſſue; and when, if <hi>Adam</hi> had an Off-ſpring, they muſt needs be involved with him in Sin and Miſery.</p>
                  <p>But when I ſay, that ſuch an Eſtate is to be preferred to that of Not-Being, I ſpeak of what is beſt for Mankind, the Subjects here diſcours'd of. Nor do I here Conſider a State of Sin abſtractly, without taking into the Conſideration of Man's Eſtate, the Means and Advantages afforded unto Sinners, in order to their getting out of it, and getting into a Condition infinitely to be deſired.</p>
                  <p>If it be here further objected, That <hi>it ſeems not conſiſtent with the Juſtice and Holineſs of God, to puniſh</hi> Adam<hi>'s Poſterity with Sin, for that Sin which he committed</hi>;</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, That if <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin be juſtly imputed to his Poſterity, ſo that they juſtly bear the Puniſhment of it, which I now take for granted, I ſee no Reaſon why they may not be puniſhed in this Way, as conſiſtently with the Juſtice and Holineſs of God, as if the Sin, for which they are ſuppoſed to be ſo puniſhed, were committed by them in their own Perſons; as in the Caſe of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and many others that might be named.</p>
                  <p>If it ſhould be here ſaid, That <hi>the Sin of a publick Perſon, or moral Head and Repreſentative, cannot be ſo imputed to the Perſons repreſented by him, as to become their's, in the ſame ſtrict Senſe as it would be, if they in' Perſon had committed it</hi>;</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="unknown:005439_0041_101830c05e09f8d0"/>I grant this to be true; and as we muſt not ſay, That our Sins imputed to Chriſt, were his, by Means of that Imputation, in the ſame Senſe in which they were our's, who committed them: So nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin imputed to us, by that Imputation made our's, in the ſame Senſe in which it was his.—Yet that Sin and Fault of his was ſo our's, that we juſtly bear the Puniſhment of it, being for it liable to the ſame Death as he himſelf was.</p>
                  <p>If it ſhould here be further ſaid, That <hi>Perſons who have never actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſinned againſt God, (if any ſuch adult Perſons there might be) could not have the ſame Conſciouſneſs of Sin, as thoſe, who in their own Perſons, have actually ſinned; —ſo niether of that Guilt and Corruption which they are fallen under, without any perſonal Fault of their own</hi>;</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, That tho' this be allowed to be a Truth, ſince the Evils we bear, by means of the Sins or Faults of others who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent us, may befall us without our perſonal Conſent given, in any Way whatſoever, to the Crimes committed by them, which ſeemeth to hold alſo in the Caſe under Conſideration; yet it may be here truly ſaid, (1) That this Miſery unto which we are ſubject by Means of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, has juſtly befallen us, on the Account of our own Sin, tho' our's only by Imputation, according to a juſt and holy Covenant, which God made with our moral Head and Repreſentative. (2) Tho' Sin, by which the miſerable State we are in has been bro't on us, was not committed by our own Perſons; yet was it committed by Perſons ſubſiſting in our Nature, and ſo is, in ſome Sort, the Sin of all Mankind, in the Way of ordinary Generation proceeding from <hi>Adam,</hi> their natural, as well as moral and political Head. And therefore, (3) We have no Reaſon to think or imagine, that had we, in our own Perſons, been put on the ſame Trial as our common Head, in our Room and Stead, was, we ſhould have done any better for our ſelves than he has done for us. (4) Tho' we cannot lament and bewail that as a Crime which we have committed in our own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which we have not ſo committed; yet we may lament the Sin committed in our Nature, by our moral Head and Repreſentative. (5) We may alſo lament and bewail the ſad Eſtate we are in, tho' by our own perſonal Fault we have not brought our ſelves into it. Tho' we brought not our ſelves into this Condition by any perſonal Offence of ours; yet it is a very miſerable Condition which we are juſtly plunged into; and as ſuch, may be juſtly bewailed by us; and on the Account of which, we have Reaſon to loath our ſelves. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.2, 3, 4.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II. Concerning that <hi>Salvation</hi> which Sinners are ſuppoſed to have offered to them in the Goſpel.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING in the foregoing Chapter conſider'd the <hi>State</hi> of Sin and Miſery, which Sinners are in, to whom the Offer of Salvation is ſuppoſed to be made in the Goſpel; we ſhall now the more eaſily conceive wherein that Salvation does conſiſt, which theſe are ſuppoſed to have an Offer of; to declare which is the Buſineſs of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>And to this I ſay in general, That this Salvation does conſiſt in Man's Deliverance from that Eſtate of Sin and Death, which I have already deſcribed, together with his Enjoyment of thoſe good Things, of which they only are made Partakers, who are delivered from the forementioned Evils; and who are made happy in the Enjoyment of God for ever. Man's Salvation does, indeed, moſt properly conſiſt in his Deliverance from all thoſe Evils, which his Sin and Apoſtacy from God has brought upon him; but it does alſo, by a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> contain and compriſe in it all thoſe good Things which they, and only they, have beſtowed on them, who ſhall be crown'd with endleſs Happineſs in the Kingdom of Glory. It is call'd <hi>eternal Salvation,</hi> Heb. 5.9. and <hi>Salvation with eternal Glory,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.10. and very frequently <hi>eternal Life,</hi> as in John 3.15, 10.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="28" facs="unknown:005439_0043_101830c5d55aa8d8"/>This Salvation compriſeth or includeth in it ſeveral Things, ſome of the principal of which may be here briefly nam'd and conſidered.</p>
                  <p>As,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. This Salvation compriſeth in it, Man's Deliverance from the Guilt of all his Sins, and his being made righteous by the perfect Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him. Indeed this ſeems not, in ſo ſtrict and proper a Senſe, to belong to Man's Salvation, as the other Things hereafter named. Strictly and properly ſpeaking, a Man is rather by this entitled to Salvation, than actually ſaved. As Sin was not the Death threatned in the firſt Covenant, but the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious or procuring Cauſe of it, Man thereby loſing or falling ſhort of that perfect Righteouſneſs, on which his Title to Life did depend; ſo when a Man is made perfectly righteous, by having the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt imputed to him, this is not properly the Life it ſelf promiſed to thoſe that believe, but that by which they have a Right and Title to that Life; for of that none are ever made Partakers, without firſt having a perfect Righteouſneſs, by which they come to have a Right and Title to it. Hence it was that <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous that he might be found in Chriſt, having on his Righteouſneſs, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9. even the ſame Righteouſneſs that is ſaid to be <hi>unto and upon them that believe,</hi> Rom. 3.22. and which is ſaid to be <hi>imputed without Works,</hi> Rom. 4.6. It may moreover be here obſerved, that the Imputation of Righteouſneſs to us does not make any <hi>real</hi> Change in our Condition, but a <hi>relative</hi> Change only. As when a condemn'd Malefactor is pardon'd, ſo that the Law has nothing to lay to his Charge, this does not of it ſelf ſet him free from his Priſon and Chains, but only makes Way for it. He remains ſtill in Hold, and bears the Burthen of his afflicted State, it may be, in a filthy Dungeon, 'till ſomething farther be done for him, <hi>i. e.</hi> 'till he have a Goal-Delivery.</p>
                  <p>This notwithſtanding, the Guilt of Sin being the Ground of all the Miſery that follows on it, it may, on that Account, be looked on as a great Part of their Miſery that lie under it, being that by which they are bound over to eternal Deſtruction, and excluded from eternal Happineſs. Now on this Account, Men's Deliverance from the Guilt of Sin may be reckoned as belonging to that Salvation, which is in the Goſpel offered to them; and therefore the Scriptures both of the old and new Teſtament, do abound with conditional Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Remiſſion of Sin, in which a Promiſe of eternal Life and Salvation is always implied; becauſe eternal Life always follows For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs and Juſtification in God's Sight. See <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6, 7, 8. Chriſt's ſaving his People from their Sins, doubtleſs comprehendeth his delivering them from the Guilt of them.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="29" facs="unknown:005439_0044_101830c96195b7a0"/>2. The Salvation offered in the Goſpel compriſeth alſo in it, Men's Deliverance from the Power and Dominion of Sin in them. And in Nothing that can be thought of, does the Salvation of Sinners more properly and eminently conſiſt, than in this. All Men are, by Nature, Servants of Sin, wholly under the Dominion of it. Every <hi>Imagination of the Thoughts of their Hearts being only evil continually,</hi> Gen. 6.5. Their Hearts are evil from their Youth. What Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and Slaves of Sin, Men in their natural Eſtate, are, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures largely expreſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14.1,—4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.1,—4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.9,—18. and elſewhere, as we have ſeen, in Part, in the foregoing Chapter; as alſo how this comes to paſs.</p>
                  <p>But now Men's Deliverance from this Servitude and Slavery muſt needs be one great Part of that Salvation, which Jeſus Chriſt came to work for them, when he came into the World to <hi>ſave his People from their Sins,</hi> as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. Of Men's Deliverance out of this Eſtate the Apoſtle treats largely, <hi>Rom.</hi> Chap. 6. eſpecially from Verſe 16 to the 22d, of which Diſcourſe we have the Sum and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion in the laſt Verſe referred to, viz. <hi>being now made free from Sin, and become Servants to God, ye have your Fruit unto Holineſs, and in the End everlaſting Life.</hi> With which Words does well agree what we have in Eph. 2.1, 2. <hi>You hath he quickned, who were dead in Treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes and Sins.</hi> Now, it is in the great Work of Regeneration that Men are thus ſaved from the Power and Dominion of Sin: Nothing ſhort of this will effectually accompliſh it. For this that Text is plain and full, Tit. 3.5. <hi>Not by Works of Righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his Mercy hath be ſaved us, by the Waſhing of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, and the Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> When Perſons are ſaid to be ſaved <hi>by the Waſhing of Regeneration,</hi> this means, that their Salvation does formally conſiſt in this: Not that this is the Condition required; for that it is not, but one great Part of that Salvation which is conditionally offered to us, I ſhall hereafter ſhew. Indeed our Salvation does not more, or more properly, conſiſt in any Thing, than in Regeneration; call'd in Scripture, our being <hi>created anew in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works,</hi> Eph. 2.10. and our being <hi>delivered from the Power of Darkneſs, and tranſlated into the Kingdom of God's dear Son,</hi> Col. 1.13. alſo our being, by Chriſt, <hi>redeemed from all Iniquity, and purified unto himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of Good Works,</hi> Tit. 2.14. This is indeed the Quickning of ſuch as are dead, <hi>dead in Sin and in the Uncircumciſion of their Fleſh</hi>; as in theſe Texts of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture does appear, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13. Thus all true Saints are <hi>ſaved and called with a holy Calling,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Tim. 1.9. And herein God manifeſts the exceeding Greatneſs of his Power to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

them that believe, <hi>according to the Working of his mighty Power which wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the dead.</hi> When this is done for Sinners, they are therein ſaved.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Salvation under Conſideration compriſeth in it, Men's Deliverance from the Power, Rule and Government of their ſpiritual Enemies. When Mankind firſt ſinned againſt God, they caſt off their Allegiance to their rightful Sovereign, and ſubjected themſelves to the Government of the Devil, and became his Slaves and Vaſſals, who deſigning their utter and eternal Ruin, by his Enticements, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd againſt them, <hi>Gen.</hi> Chap. 3. and took them <hi>captive at his Will,</hi> and ſtill rules over all ſuch as are not delivered out of his Snare. Now this <hi>Prince of Devils</hi> does, by his <hi>Legions</hi> of evil Angels, that attend on him, as <hi>the Prince of the Power of the Air,</hi> ſtill work <hi>in the Children of Diſobedience,</hi> tempting and over-coming all ſuch as belong to <hi>the Kingdom of Darkneſs</hi>; and finally deſtroys all ſuch as are not delivered out of his Hands.</p>
                  <p>Now in Men's Deliverance out of the Hands of this Enemy, (or rather, all theſe Enemies) does their Salvation very much conſiſt. And this their Deliverance was moſt expreſly foretold, yea ingaged, in that Promiſe given immediately after Man's Fall, Gen. 3.15. That <hi>the Seed of the Woman ſhould break the Serpent's Head</hi>: By his doing of which, the Seed of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> were to be ſet at Liberty, when that glorious Promiſe ſhould be fulfilled, in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.10, 11, 12. and <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49.24, 25. which Prophecies were accompliſhed by Jeſus Chriſt, in the Days of his Fleſh; and the Praiſe of God was, on that Account, celebrated at his Appearance in our Nature, by <hi>Zecharias,</hi> in his Song, <hi>Luke</hi> Chap. 1. Verſe 67,—74. who being filled with the Holy Ghoſt, propheſied and ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>for he hath viſited and redeemed his People, and hath raiſed up an Horn of Salvation for us, in the Houſe of his Servant</hi> David; <hi>as he ſpake by the Mouth of his holy Prophets, which have been ſince the World began; that we ſhould be ſaved from our Enemies, and from the Hand of all that hate us. To perform the Mercy promiſed to our Fathers, and to remember his holy Covenant: The Oath which he ſware to our Father</hi> Abraham, <hi>that he will grant us, that we being delivered out of the Hands of all our Enemies, might ſerve him without Fear,</hi> &amp;c. The Price of this Redemption was paid by our Redeemer, when he pour'd out his Soul unto Death, and was number'd with the Tranſgreſſors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſpeaks, in <hi>Iſai.</hi> Chap. 53. before quoted. And Sinners are actually freed from the Dominion of the Enemies of their
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005439_0046_101830d3d2f0b970"/>
Souls, when being made Partakers of the Graces of God's Spirit, they are made ſtrong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might; enabled to wreſtle with, and overcome, the Rulers of the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this World, as is expreſſed at large in <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.10. and onwards to Verſe 18.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Salvation offered to Sinners in the Goſpel, does alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe in it, their Perſeverance in true Faith and Holineſs unto the End of their Lives. Perſeverance in true Faith and Holineſs, is not the Condition on which eternal Salvation is offered; as if our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſuſpended on our <hi>Perſeverance</hi>: But on the contrary, <hi>it</hi> is contained and engaged in the Promiſe of Salvation made to every true Believer. Every true Believer, or regenerate Saint, has already <hi>eternal Life, and ſhall not come into Condemnation, but is paſſed from Death to Life,</hi> Joh. 5.24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. Such an one has already performed the Condition, on which Salvation is promiſed to him: Therefore his Perſeverance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the End belongs to his Salvation, and is ſecured to him in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe—And how ſhould the ſame Thing belong both to the Salvation promiſed, and the Condition of the Promiſe? — I hope in this, I ſhall meet with no Oppoſition from <hi>Calviniſts</hi>: And with <hi>Arminians</hi> my direct Deſign is not to diſpute. And I affirm, That there is no Text of Scripture, wherein eternal Salvation is conditionally promiſed, but what promiſeth Perſeverance to the End, without which Men neither are, nor can be, eternally ſaved. But beſides this, there be many other more expreſs Promiſes made to the Faithful, (at leaſt plainly implied in the Texts intended) of Perſeverance to the End. Among many ſuch they who pleaſe may ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.38, 39, 40. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40.28,— 31. alſo Chap. 41.10, 13, 14. and Chap. 49.14, 15, 16. alſo Chap. 54.6,—10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.1, 2.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Salvation of ſinful Men does, in Part, conſiſt in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Deliverance from Sin and all Temptations to Sin, in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Death. Notwithſtanding Men's Deliverance from the reigning Power of Sin and Satan, in their Regeneration and Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the deſtructive Influences of theſe Enemies, in their Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, they are not wholly freed from indwelling Sin, and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Sin during this Life. While they are here in a militant State, Sin and Satan are ſuffered to moleſt and annoy them, and ſometimes, in particular Conflicts, to prevail againſt them, and put them to the worſe. The Condition of God's Children, with Reſpect hereunto, is fully and clearly expreſs'd by the Apoſtle, in <hi>Rom.</hi> Chap. 7. Ver. 14. and onwards to the End, and <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. But at the Moment
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005439_0047_101830d55f9799c8"/>
of the Death of the true Children of God, they are perfectly freed from any further Moleſtations from, or by theſe Enemies, being made then perfectly holy and removed out of their Reach. They are then taken from <hi>the Evil</hi> that is here, and <hi>enter into Peace, dying in the Lord, and reſting in their Beds, each One walking in his Uprightneſs,</hi> Iſai. 57.1, 2. <hi>They reſt from their Labours, and their Works follow them,</hi> Rev. 14.13. their Spirits then being made perfect, in Reſpect of their Freedom from Sin. They are prepared for, and convey'd to, the Society and Communion of the Saints in Light, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.22, 23.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Salvation offered in the Goſpel comprehendeth in it, Man's Deliverance from his laſt Enemy, which is Death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.26. Death is certainly an Enemy to Mankind. Humane Nature ſhrinks at it: It is called <hi>the King of Terrors,</hi> Job 18.14. It is <hi>the Wages of Sin,</hi> Rom. 6.23. <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. tho' our Saviour hath taken away the Sting of Death, which is Sin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55, 56.</p>
                  <p>But at the Reſurrection of the Juſt, this Enemy ſhall be removed, when the dead Bodies of God's Saints ſhall be raiſed, and <hi>this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption ſhall put on Incorruption, and this Mortal ſhall put on Immortality,</hi> as in 1 Cor. 15.54, 55. and when <hi>our vile Bodies ſhall be changed, and faſhioned like to the glorious Body of Chriſt,</hi> Phil. 3.21.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Man's Salvation, now under Conſideration, does comprehend and include in it, his being put in Poſſeſſion of that Glory and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which the Saints ſhall enjoy in the heavenly World for ever, when the great Judge of the World ſhall ſay to the Sheep on his right Hand, as in Matth. 25.34. <hi>Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foundation of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is to be feared that ſome, when they talk of Salvation, intend only this Part of it laſt mentioned, without duly conſidering the other foregoing, and with Reſpect to this, pre-requiſite Parts of Man's Salvation, eſpecially Man's Salvation from Sin. But what God has joined together, we ſhould not ſeparate in our Minds. The ſeven Things mentioned all belong to that Salvation which is offered in the Goſpel. God gives none of them to any one to whom he gives them not all.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. Shewing what is imported in Salvation's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offered.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING conſidered what is intended by that Salvation which, I ſay, is offered to Sinners in the Goſpel; it is neceſſary that I now proceed to conſider what is intended by an <hi>Offer</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>Now to this I ſay, in general, That by Salvation's being offered unto Sinners, I intend its being condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally promiſed to them. I take an <hi>Offer</hi> of a Thing, to be the ſame, in Effect, as a conditional Promiſe of it made to the Perſon unto whom it is ſaid to be <hi>offered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In an <hi>Offer,</hi> or <hi>conditional Promiſe,</hi> made to any Perſon, there is ſomething propos'd to be done by him unto whom the <hi>Offer</hi> is made; and ſome Advantage, either explicitly or implicity, promiſed to him on his doing what is <hi>propoſed.</hi> I ſay, <hi>propoſed,</hi> becauſe the Thing may not be <hi>required</hi> of him as his Duty, but propos'd only as the Term or Condition, on which he may have the Advantage offered to him.</p>
                  <p>But, in the Offer of Salvation made to Sinners in the Goſpel, the Thing propos'd to be done by ſinful Men is propoſed as a <hi>Duty,</hi> which they are under indiſpenſible Obligations to perform; becauſe the Thing is required by God of them; and therefore neceſſary, becauſe they cannot be ſaved without it.</p>
                  <p>That which is required of ſinful Men, in order to their Salvation, may, for ought I can yet ſee, be very fitly called the <hi>Condition</hi> on which Salvation is offered to them. I readily acknowledge, that there are ſeveral Sorts of <hi>Conditions,</hi> differing very conſiderably one from another; of which Differences I ſhall have Occaſion hereafter to ſay ſomething: For it is very neceſſary that we rightly underſtand what Kind of Condition <hi>that</hi> is, on which Salvation is ſaid to be offered; but doubtleſs we may allow, that the Thing required may be called a <hi>Condition,</hi> and ſo I intend to call it in this Diſcourſe; and I hope it will, in the Iſſue, appear, that no hurtful Conſequences will attend its being ſo accounted and called.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="unknown:005439_0049_101830d9edc88cf0"/>In this which I call the <hi>Condition</hi> on which Salvation is offered, I comprehend and include every Thing that is required of Man, as indiſpenſibly neceſſary in order to his Salvation, ſo that God will not ſave him without his doing it; and unto his doing of which a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of Salvation is annex'd. To be ſure, if there be any Thing which if a Man will not do God will not ſave him, that Thing muſt be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as compriſed in the Condition of Man's Salvation; and unto whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a Promiſe of Salvation is made in God's holy Word, the Thing being to be done in order to our Salvation, that Thing is compriſed in the Condition required. — It matters not whether all ſo required be conſidered as one Condition, or as many, their Conditionality in this Affair being ſtill affirmed: But if we ſpeak of this as one Condition; as I uſually do, then what is more particularly compriſed therein, ought to be diſtinctly conſidered and declared, by what Name ſoever ſuch Things are called, as <hi>Faith, Repentance, Obedience, ſeeking the Lord, calling on him, coming to Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. And it doubtleſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all theſe Things in it, as I ſhall hereafter ſhew, removing ſuch Objections as are apt to be made againſt it.</p>
                  <p>And whereas all Mankind may be divided into two Sorts, or People of two different Conditions, <hi>viz.</hi> ſuch as are in a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and juſtified Eſtate, and ſuch as are not, but in a State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, under the Wrath and Curſe of God, and ſo liable to eternal Damnation: it will certainly be neceſſary to conſider which of theſe two Eſtates Sinners muſt be ſuppoſed to be in, when they perform the Condition, on which God offers to ſave them: And this ſeems to me to be an eaſy Queſtion, but ſince many have, in this, a different Way of Thinking from me, this is to be particularly diſcuſſed in the ſecond Part of this Eſſay, altho' it ſeems well nigh put out of Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the ſecond Chapter of this.</p>
                  <p>That what is required of ſinful Men in order to their Juſtification and Salvation, is well called by the Name of <hi>Faith,</hi> I very freely acknowledge; and that it is very frequently ſo called in Scripture is to me evident: But that it is alſo called by many other Names I ſhall ſhew, with the Reaſon of this Variety—. But whereas ſome miſlike the calling of that <hi>Faith,</hi> by which we are in Scripture ſaid to be ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified, by the Name of a <hi>Condition</hi>; this may be here a little conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. Some object againſt this Word on the Account of the Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guity of it, there being <hi>Conditions</hi> of different Sorts or Kinds, ſome of which will not, as they think, agree to the Nature and Uſe of that Faith by which we are ſaid to be juſtified. But this perhaps may as
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:005439_0050_101831316858b858"/>
well be objected againſt the Word <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> uſed by ſome inſtead of it. And ſome think that this Word aſcribes more to Faith, in the Affair of our Juſtification, than does indeed belong to it; or at leaſt, that it does not well expreſs the true Uſe and Influence of Faith, in the Juſtification of a Sinner before God. Some therefore expreſs the Influence of Faith in this Affair by the Word <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times call it an <hi>inſtrumental Cauſe.</hi> But the uſe of this Word or Expreſſion is alſo tho't by <hi>ſeveral,</hi> to have its Inconveniences; with whom I alſo concur.</p>
                  <p>A learned and judicious Divine obſerving theſe Difficulties, as he conceives them to be, has thus expreſs'd himſelf in this Matter.
<q>I humbly conceive, ſaith he, we have been ready to look too far to find out what that Influence of Faith in our Juſtification is, or what is that Dependance of this Effect on Faith, ſignified by this Expreſſion of being <hi>juſtified by Faith,</hi> over-looking that which is moſt obviouſly pointed forth in the Expreſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Caſe being as it is, (there being a Mediator that has purchaſed Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation) Faith in this Mediator is that which renders it a <hi>meet</hi> and <hi>ſuitable Thing</hi> in the Sight of God, that he rather than others ſhould have this purchaſed Benefit aſſigned to him,</q>
                     <hi>viz.</hi> he that believeth in the Mediator. Now I willingly agree with this worthy Author, that <hi>that</hi> Faith by which the Ungodly are ſaid to be juſtified, is the moſt <hi>meet</hi> and <hi>ſuitable Thing</hi> that could have been required of them to that End; and this was doubtleſs the Reaſon why God made choice of it to the Place and Office to which he aſſigned it, rather than any other Thing whatſoever; yet I think, with Submiſſion to thoſe of better Judgment, That this is no Ways inconſiſtent with its being called <hi>the Condition</hi> of Men's Juſtification: And it ſeems to me very evident, that its being ſo meet and ſuitable a Qualification, as is expreſs'd, is not that by which a firm and ſure Connexion is eſtabliſhed betwixt a Sinner's believing and his being juſtified. The Reaſon why all that believe are infallibly juſtified and ſaved, is not becauſe the Sinner that believeth in Chriſt is ſo meetly and ſuitably qualified to receive the Benefit of Juſtification; but this rather, that by the Promiſe of God there is infallible Aſſurance given, that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth ſhall be juſtified and ſaved, as in <hi>John</hi> 3.15, 16. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. Were it not for this, Sinners could not be ſure that they ſhould be ſaved on Suppoſition of their believing, were it poſſible, that they ſhould believe, having no ſuch Promiſe. So that af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> all, it is the <hi>Conditionality</hi> of Faith in the Covenant of Grace, that gives it the Advantage of being any Ways inſtrumental in our
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:005439_0051_101830df06ccc0d0"/>
Juſtification <note n="†" place="bottom">See <hi>Willard</hi> of <hi>Juſtification,</hi> on <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9.</note>. Thus <hi>it is by Faith, that thro' Grace the Promiſe may be ſure to all the Seed,</hi> as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18.</p>
                  <p>What that Faith is, unto which a Promiſe of Juſtification is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, is a Matter of great Importance, and ought diligently to be enquired into; and I purpoſe, with God's Help, to conſider this important Point, before I finiſh this Eſſay: But this is not what, in this Place, I deſign. At preſent I only ſay, it is the ſame that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the Texts of Scripture laſt quoted, and in other Places, ſhewing what Men muſt do to be ſaved, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37, 38. and 16.30, 31. What is here incumbent on me, is, to ſtate and clear up the true Notion of an <hi>Offer</hi> of Salvation made to Sinners in the Goſpel; and unto this End ſomething further remains to be ſaid.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then, the Condition upon which Salvation is offered to <hi>Sinners</hi> is ſomething required <hi>of them,</hi> that ſo they may be ſaved; ſomething to be done by them unto whom the Offer of Salvation is ſuppoſed to be made. The Condition required is not meerly this, that if ſuch or ſuch a Thing come to paſs, then God will ſave us; but if we comply with his Will in doing what is required of us, then God will beſtow his Salvation on us. It is, I ſay, ſomething to be done by us, not by God himſelf, or any one elſe beſides our ſelves; and this too ſomething wherein we yield Obedience to the Call of God in the Goſpel; ſomething contained in a proper Anſwer to this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Enquiry, "What ſhall I do to be ſaved". The Difference betwixt the Covenant of Works, and that of Grace, lies not in this, that the Covenant of Works required our doing ſomething that ſo we might live, but the Covenant of Grace nothing at all. What the Covenant of Grace requireth to this End, is ſometimes called the <hi>Obedience of Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 16.26. and <hi>obeying the Goſpel.</hi> It is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wherein we perform our Duty to God as well as ſecure the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our own Souls.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Condition, to this End required, is not only ſuch, that we ſhall not be ſaved if we perform it not; but that we ſhall be ſaved if we perform the Thing required. We are not only threatned with Death and Damnation, in Caſe we do it not; but have a Promiſe of Life and Salvation, if we perform it. There are ſome Things which if thoſe that enjoy the Goſpel will not do, they ſhall be damned; as to inſtance in two or three. If they will not hear or read the Word
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:005439_0052_10183134e2d1c1e0"/>
of God, meditate on it, endeavour to underſtand it, nor at all Regard what is required of them in it; ſuch, I ſay, as will not do theſe Things ſhall certainly be damned; but Perſons may do ſuch Things as theſe, and yet never be ſaved. God has not promiſed, that all that, after any Manner, do ſuch Things, ſhall obtain eternal Life. But the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition on which Salvation is offered, is ſuch as whoſoever complies with it ſhall certainly be ſaved.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Condition on which Salvation is offered in the Goſpel, muſt needs be ſuch as may be, and is, performed by all that obtain eternal Life, <hi>before</hi> they do obtain it. Men cannot, in the Way of a Covenant, obtain a good Thing conditionally promiſed to them in it, 'till they have performed the Condition on which that Thing is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed. But when I ſay here, <hi>before,</hi> this muſt not be underſtood, as before, in Time, but in Reſpect of the Order of Nature, or accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Reaſon or Dependance of Things one on another: For otherwiſe, as ſoon as the Condition required is by any Sinner per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, God without any Delay begins to ſave him; yea, puts him into a State of Salvation, ſee <hi>John</hi> 5.24. But God will not ſo much as begin to beſtow eternal Life on any Man, 'till he has performed the Condition on which the ſame is offered to him.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We ought here carefully to diſtinguiſh between an antecedent Condition, and ſuch as is only concomitant. By an <hi>antecedent</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, I underſtand ſuch an one as is deſcribed in the laſt Head, <hi>i. e.</hi> one required in order to our having a good Thing conditionally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed: But by a <hi>concomitant</hi> Condition, I intend ſuch a one as does inſeparably accompany a good Thing conditionally promiſed, but is not, in order of Nature, before it. Thus, true Holineſs inſeparably accompanies the Juſtification of a Sinner; becauſe God regenerates every one whom he juſtifies, and that in the very Moment in which he juſtifies him. But true Holineſs is not an antecedent Condition of Man's Juſtification, not being required in order to it, tho' it be inſeparably joined with it, and is a Qualification belonging to every juſtified Perſon. Hence, tho' God promiſes Salvation to all holy Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yet Holineſs is not the Condition on which Salvation is promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; nor is any Act ſo, which floweth from a Principle of true Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſo belongeth to our Sanctification; as I ſhall hereafter ſhew.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. We ought carefully to diſtinguiſh betwixt the Acts materially conſidered, in which the Condition of the new Covenant does conſiſt, and the Rectitude of the ſame Acts, and the Manner in which they
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:005439_0053_101830e3ece05b88"/>
muſt be performed. In this Chapter I only conſider what Acts are required: What is required in Order to their Rectitude will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd in the ſecond Part of this Eſſay.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Again, we muſt diſtinguiſh betwixt what is required in the Condition under Conſideration, with Relation to the general and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Nature of it, <hi>i. e.</hi> in what Acts it conſiſts, and how theſe muſt be performed; and what is required with Reſpect to the Prolonga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Continuance of what is required: For a Man may begin, and for a Time do what, as a Condition, is required of him, in order to his having a Benefit which is conditionally promiſed to him; and yet by his Failure ſall ſhort of the Good, which, in this Way, he is a Candidate for. Thus our firſt Parents either did or might have, for a Time, continued their Obedience to the Law of Works; and yet, for want of Continuance therein, they ſell ſhort of Life and Happineſs, and ſo ruined themſelves and all their Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>And thus I will alſo ſhew, that the Caſe may be, with Reſpect to Perſons that are in a State of Probation, in order to their obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſaving Benefits of the new Covenant: And yet, I am far from holding a Poſſibility of falling from Grace, in the Senſe in which <hi>Arminians</hi> and others plead for it, <hi>viz.</hi> that regenerate and juſtified Perſons may fall away, and finally periſh. Yet it is true, that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be engaged in ſuch a Courſe that they ſhould certainly be ſaved, did not their Apoſtacy prevent it, as I ſhall hereafter make evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.13. and other Places.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. It is neceſſary that I here further obſerve, that the Condition of the Covenant required, in order to the Salvation of ſinful Men, differs greatly from that which was required in the Covenant of Works, in order to Men's obtaining Life.</p>
                  <p>If I mention three remarkable Differences betwixt theſe it will be ſufficient.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They differ in Reſpect of the Nature of the Thing required: For in the Covenant of Works, the Condition required was perfect Obedience, without any Failure, as to the Matter or Manner of its Performance, as appears <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10.

in the Covenant of Works, it was to be the very Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the Performance of which, Men were to ſtand righteous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and obtain a Title to eternal Life: But that required in the <hi>new Covenant</hi> is not, according to the Tenor of IT, to be our juſtifying Righteouſneſs, or that by which we ſhould have a Right unto eternal Life, but is required of Sinners in order to their having an Intereſt in the perfect Righteouſneſs of Another, for their Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in God's Sight; even the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, which is <hi>unto and upon all them that believe,</hi> Rom. 3.22. Such therefore as believe are in Scripture ſaid to <hi>believe unto Righteouſneſs,</hi> i<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> e. unto the obtaining of it; their Faith not being the Righteouſneſs it ſelf, that in which their juſtifying Righteouſneſs does conſiſt. Read and compare <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5, and ver. 22. The Particle tranſlated <hi>in,</hi> in the two Texts laſt referred to, being the ſame which is tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>to,</hi> in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. Faith therefore, which is unto Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is only ſo far accepted of God, as that by it we obtain an Intereſt in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. And from the Differences already mentioned, it followeth <hi>thirdly,</hi> That the Condition required in the Covenant of Grace is, in a Senſe, a <hi>gracious Condition,</hi> in which that required in the Covenant of Works was not. <hi>That</hi> required in the Covenant of Grace is ſuch as may be performed <hi>by Sinners. That</hi> of the Covenant of Works was not ſo; but compatible only to the State of Mankind, <hi>while in Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. That</hi> of the Covenant of Grace is required that ſo we may <hi>become</hi> righteous; but <hi>that</hi> of the Covenant of Works was required that ſo Men might <hi>remain</hi> righteous, as they then actually were. In a Word, <hi>that</hi> now required is the Condition of a moſt gracious and merciful Covenant. <hi>That</hi> of the Covenant of Works was ſuch as that Men, in the Performance of it, might obtain Life by their own perfect Obedience.</p>
                  <p>Thus it appears, that the <hi>Condition</hi> of the Covenant of Grace is of another Kind than <hi>that</hi> of the Covenant of Works. But it does not by any Means appear, that what is in the Covenant of Grace re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of Men, in order to their Salvation, is no Condition at all; nor ought that to be granted.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. Shewing, That there is an Offer or conditional Promiſe of Salvation made to Sinners in the Goſpel.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING hitherto endeavoured to explain the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition under Conſideration; I come now, in the fourth and laſt Place, to ſay ſomething for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Truth aſſerted, <hi>viz.</hi> that it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Truth, that God does offer Salvation to ſinful Men in the Goſpel; or that he does condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally promiſe to beſtow eternal Life on them.</p>
                  <p>But before I enter on the Proof of this moſt comfortable Aſſertion, it is very neceſſary that one Thing, very evidently ſuppoſed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in it, be a little explained and cleared up, without the doing of which the main Aſſertion here maintained cannot be very advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and clearly ſupported.</p>
                  <p>Now that which I here intend is this, That Mankind have, ſince their Fall into a State of Sin and Death, had ſo much done for them, in order to their Recovery out of that miſerable Eſtate, as thereby to be put into a State of Salvability: For otherwiſe there would be no Room for an Offer of Salvation to be made to them. Now Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, ſince their Apoſtacy, may be conceived to be in a ſalvable Condition in two Reſpects, or on a two-fold Account. (1) In Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Sufficiency of God to find out and provide a Way for their Salvation, whatever ſeeming Difficulties, in Reſpect of the Threatning denounced againſt Sinners, and of his own Truth and Juſtice, ſeemed to lie againſt it; yet this notwithſtanding, I ſay, the Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and Power of God was ſuch, that it was, in that Reſpect, poſſible for him to find out and provide a Way, in which ſuch Sinners as Mankind were, might be eternally ſaved. But this is not what I principally here intend. Wherefore, (2) Mankind may be ſaid to be in a ſalvable State, in Reſpect of a Price already paid, or undertaken to be paid, for their Redemption. I ſay, either paid or undertaken to be paid, becauſe this was the ſame Thing in Reſpect
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:005439_0056_1018313933079d28"/>
of the Efficacy of the Atonement I intend. It was as available, in Reſpect of all the ſaving Ends of it, before it was actually paid, as it was afterwards; and on this Account our Saviour is call'd <hi>the Lamb ſlain from the Foundation of the World.</hi> It is in Reſpect of this Price of Redemption, that I here affirm Mankind to be in a ſalvable Eſtate. They are ſo now, in Reſpect of a Price already paid for them, in order to their eternal Happineſs. And this I ſuppoſe to be a Truth, with Reſpect to all Mankind without Exception: So that tho' there are many who never will be ſaved, yet the Reaſon of this is not, becauſe there is not a ſufficient Price paid for their Redemption, nor becauſe this is not a Remedy applicable to them, according to the Tenor of the new Covenant, but for other Reaſons hereafter to be mentioned.</p>
                  <p>This State of Salvability, which Mankind are by me ſuppoſed to be in, has its Riſe and Foundation, as I have ſaid, in the Price of Redemption paid for them, by their great Saviour; and that this was of ſufficient Value to ſave the whole World I here take for granted. That it was a Price laid down for all, without Exception; and, according to the Tenor of the new Covenant, applicable to any one, and to every one of the ſinful Children of Men, I ſuppoſe to be a Truth clearly revealed in the Word of God; and that the Reaſon why it is not ſo generally believed ſo to be, is not becauſe it is not ſufficiently aſſerted in Scripture, but becauſe many have, without ſufficient Grounds, ſuppoſed that a Belief of this cannot be reconciled to ſome other Articles of Faith, which they think clearly and ſully revealed: But this I ſhall have Occaſion hereafter to conſider.</p>
                  <p>At preſent I will ſhew, what is in Scripture affirmed, with Reſpect to the Extent of Chriſt's Death, with Relation to the End and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it. And here, not to inſiſt on what is ſaid about his mediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Righteouſneſs, in <hi>Rom.</hi> Chap. 5. betwixt the 12th and the 19th Verſes, where his Righteouſneſs is oppoſed to the Sin of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> as a ſufficient Remedy againſt the Miſchiefs and Miſeries brought on Mankind by it; I ſhall only recite ſome of thoſe Paſſages of Scripture, wherein the Univerſality of Chriſt's Death, as it reſpects the Perſons for whom he died, ſeems to be plainly and fully aſſerted. Thus we are told, that <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life,</hi> John 3.16. That <hi>he is the Propitiation for our Sins: And not for our's only, but for the Sins of the whole World,</hi> 1 John 2.2. That <hi>he taſted Death for every Man,</hi> Heb. 2.9. That <hi>he gave himſelf
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:005439_0057_101830e9fa732280"/>
a Ranſom for all,</hi> 1 Tim. 2.6. That <hi>he died for all,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.14, 15. And that <hi>he is the Saviour of all Men, eſpecially of thoſe that believe,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.10.</p>
                  <p>That the moſt obvious Senſe of theſe Texts of Scripture, is, That Jeſus Chriſt died for all Men without Exception, I think very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Nor is it at our Liberty to recede from this, without ſome urgent Neceſſity compelling us to it, which I ſuppoſe can never be ſhown; but inſtead thereof, I will ſhew a Neceſſity of taking of them in the full Latitude in which they are expreſs'd. I do not therefore wonder, that there have been a great many eminent Divines, in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, who have been far from being <hi>Arminians,</hi> that have plainly and fully aſſerted Chriſt's dying for all, as I could eaſily ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, did I rely on humane Authorities, as I do not.</p>
                  <p>Yet I ſhall mention one Inſtance of this, not ſo much on the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Authority of the Man (tho' I know of no Man whoſe Authority would go farther in this Caſe) as becauſe I think he fairly ſtates wherein the Difference lies betwixt himſelf and ſome others, and particularly betwixt what he held and I now hold, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently wherein the Criſis of this Controverſy does, in my Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, lie.</p>
                  <p>The Perſon I intend is the learned Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi>: And the Book from which I ſhall take ſome Paſſages, is entitled, <hi>The Riches of God's Love to the Veſſels of Mercy,</hi> &amp;c. Part 1. Page 5.
<q>We are often demanded, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> whether every one that heareth the Goſpel be not bound to believe that Chriſt died for him? Now I ſay this Phraſe, <hi>Chriſt died for me,</hi> includes many Things, as the Benefits which ariſe unto me by the Death of Chriſt, may be conceived to be many. But let theſe Benefits be diſtinguiſhed, and we ſhall readily anſwer to the Queſtion made, and that perhaps differently, as namely, affirmatively to ſome, negatively to others; as thus, Do you ſpeak of Chriſt's dying for me, that is, for the Pardon of my Sins, and for the Salvation of my Soul, I anſwer affirmatively and ſay, I am bound to believe that Chriſt died for the procuring of theſe Benefits unto me, in ſuch Manner as God hath ordained; to wit, not abſolutely but conditionally, to wit, in Caſe I do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and repent. For God hath not otherwiſe ordained, that I ſhould reap the Benefits of Pardon and Salvation, by virtue of Chriſt's Death and Paſſion, unleſs I believe in him and repent.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="43" facs="unknown:005439_0058_1018313dcd7eb258"/>In another Place, this learned Author aſſerting the Death of Chriſt in the ſame Latitude and Extent, ſaith, (Page 154)
<q>To die for us, or for all, is to die for our Benefit, or for the Benefit of all: Now theſe Benefits are of a different Nature, whereof ſome are beſtowed upon Man only conditionally (tho' for Chriſt's Sake) and they are the Pardon of Sin and the Salvation of the Soul, and theſe God doth confer only upon the Condition of Faith and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. Now I am ready to profeſs and that, I ſuppoſe, as our of the Mouth of all our Divines, That every one who hears the Goſpel, (without Diſtinction between Elect and Reprobate) is bound to believe that Chriſt died for him, ſo far as to procure both the Pardon of his Sins and the Salvation of his Soul, in Caſe he believes and repents.</q>
In another Place he ſaith, That as
<q>
                        <hi>Peter</hi> could not have been ſaved, unleſs he had believed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented; ſo <hi>Judas</hi> might have been ſaved, if he had done ſo.</q>
And the Doctor referring to that Text, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. ſaith on it, That
<q>it gives a fair Light of Expoſition to thoſe Places where Chriſt is ſaid to have died for the Sins of the World, yea, of the whole World, to wit, in this Manner, That whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus far I have Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> fully with me in what I aſſert, <hi>viz.</hi> That Chriſt died for all Men, ſo far forth as to purchaſe Life and Salvation for them, in Caſe they believe in him, and repent of their Sins. He did this for the whole World, and not for the Elect only: So there is no Man but what may be ſaved on the Terms of the new Covenant, even <hi>Judas</hi> was not excepted or excluded.</p>
                  <p>But here I muſt add a Word, leſt this ſhould be miſunderſtood. The Meaning of this Aſſertion is not, that it is a Truth, that Jeſus Chriſt died for all Men, if it ſhall eventually come to paſs that all Men believe in him, but that otherwiſe this Aſſertion is falſe. It is even now a Truth, that Chriſt died for all Men, or otherwiſe that he did not die for all Men. This cannot be made either true or falſe, by Men's future Carriages. The Meaning therefore of the Aſſertion maintained, is, that Jeſus Chriſt has really ſo died for all Men, as to purchaſe this Advantage for them, that they ſhall be ſaved, if they will believe and repent.</p>
                  <p>It is not ſuppoſed in what is here maintained, that Jeſus Chriſt died equally, or in the ſame Senſe, for all Mankind, Elect and Non-Elect. The Difference here is wide, and may, I think, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e beſt conceived of, by a due Conſideration of the Relation of Chriſt's Death to the two Covenants, to which it has a Reference: I mean that of Redemption
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:005439_0059_101830ee326788b0"/>
betwixt the glorious Perſons of the holy Trinity, and that of Grace (as it is commonly called) which God has been pleaſed to propoſe to Mankind ſince the Fall.</p>
                  <p>If we conſider the Death of Chriſt, with Relation to the Covenant of Redemption, or Terms agreed on betwixt the Son of God on the one Part, (as I conceive) and the Father and the holy Spirit, on the other, tho' the Father be more expreſly mentioned in Scripture, as concerned in this Covenant, than the holy Spirit: If, I ſay, we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Death of Chriſt, with Relation to this Covenant, the Son of God did, by his Death and mediatorial Righteouſneſs, obtain for the Elect of God, or all thoſe whom in Scripture the Father is ſaid to have given him, a perfect and compleat Salvation in all the Parts and Branches of it, the principal of which are enumerated in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. viz. <hi>Effectual Calling, Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Glorification</hi>: For in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant here intended, Sinners themſelves are not a Party; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Conditions to be performed lie not on them, but on the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, who undertook for them, and fulfilled the Terms required of him, in order to the Salvation of thoſe who were ordained to Life. None of theſe, therefore, ever miſcarry, as might be plainly ſhewed from Scripture, were it my preſent Buſineſs. Such as pleaſe may read and compare <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.10, 11, 12. <hi>John</hi> 6.38, 39, 40. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.29. <hi>Acts</hi> 23.48. <hi>John</hi> 7.37. and Chap. 10.27, 28, 29. Hence the Acts of Chriſt's Mediation are ſpoken of, as having a peculiar Reference to theſe, in many Places of Scripture, as in <hi>John</hi> 17. ver. 6, 8, and 19, 20. and Chap. 10.15. But ſuch Places are not to be underſtood as if Chriſt died for the Elect only: for beſides his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely mentioning the Salvation of all theſe, he was, according to the Covenant of Redemption which he entred into, to bring the Reſt into a State of Salvability, that ſo God might be juſt in juſtifying any of them on the Terms of another Covenant, (that of Grace I intend) which was to be propoſed to Sinners themſelves, as plainly appears, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25, 26. with which that well agreeth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. And upon Chriſt's doing this are grounded all the Offers of ſpecial Mercy made to Sinners in the Covenant of Grace, ſuch as are implied in <hi>John</hi> 3.16. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. and <hi>Acts</hi> 16.30, 31. And tho' Chriſt has by his Obedience and Death, purchaſed the Whole of the Salvation of all the Elect, ſo that the ſame is juſtly due to him; yet they cannot come to the Enjoyment of this Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 'till they come up to the Terms of the Goſpel, wherein it is conditionally offered to them. How God deals with thoſe unto whom Goſpel Terms are not offered, I am not here conſidering: But this I will venture to ſay, that I conceive them to be in a ſalvable
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:005439_0060_1018314112921ac8"/>
State, ſo that if they are not ſaved, it is not becauſe Juſtice will not allow of it. And I doubt not but that Jeſus Chriſt was to bring the whole World into ſuch a State as this, and not the Elect only.</p>
                  <p>And now let us conſider the Death of Chriſt, as it has a Relation to the Covenant of Grace, propoſed to Sinners themſelves. Now as Chriſt's Death relates to this Covenant, no Man can plead a Right to the Benefits procured by it, 'till he believes in him that died for him; nor can he be put in Poſſeſſion of the ſpecial Benefits offered in this Covenant, except he performs the Conditions of it. In this Reſpect <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> Elect and Non-Elect, are on a Level. He that believeth ſhall be ſaved; he that believeth not ſhall be damned. As the mediatorial Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is ſufficient for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the whole World, ſo it is, according to the Tenor of the new Covenant, a Remedy applicable to any Perſon, on the Terms therein propoſed; ſo that it is not contrary to the Juſtice of God, effectually to call, juſtify, and glorify any Perſon whatſoever. If this is not done for all, it is not becauſe there is not a ſufficient Remedy provided, but for ſuch other Reaſons as are given in God's Word.</p>
                  <p>But now let us conſider the Doctor's Antitheſis, in the Place above quoted, Page 5.
<q>If, ſaith he, the Queſtion be made, Whether I am bound to believe that Chriſt died for me, to procure Faith and Repentance for me, I do not ſay, that I am bound, or that every Man is bound to believe this.</q>
And a little below he ſaith,
<q>I ſee a Reaſon manifeſting that Chriſt merited not this for all, no not for all, and every one that hears the Goſpel. For if he had, then he had merited it for them abſolutely, or conditionally, not abſolutely, for then all, and every one ſhould believe <hi>de facto,</hi> which is untrue; for the Apoſtle ſaith, (2 Theſ. 3.) <hi>Fides non eſt omnium</hi>; nor conditionally, for what Condition, I pray, can be deviſed, upon the Performance whereof, God, for Chriſt's Sake, ſhould give us Faith and Repentance.</q>
To this Demand I ſhall hereafter anſwer.</p>
                  <p>Thus, according to Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> tho' the Pardon of Men's Sins and the Salvation of their Souls were conditionally purchaſed for them by Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>viz.</hi> on the Condition of Faith and Repentance, and this for all, without Exception; yet theſe Conditions were, by Jeſus Chriſt, purchaſed only for the Elect, and are not offered unto Sinners, on any Condition whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>The latter Part of what he held I ſhall hereafter conſider. That Chriſt died to obtain Salvation for all Men, on the Terms of the new Covenant, I now take for granted, at leaſt ſuppoſe it to be a Truth:
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:005439_0061_101830efdfcf5b38"/>
And all thoſe for whom Chriſt thus died, I hold to be in a ſalvable Eſtate; otherwiſe, how are they beholden to Chriſt for thus dying for them?</p>
                  <p>And I would fain be plainly ſhewed how the Goſpel can be preached to any Sinner for whom Chriſt thus died not? Or on what Foundation any Sinner can have Salvation offered to him, for whom it hath never been ſo much as conditionally obtained by Jeſus Chriſt, in the Senſe allowed by Dr. <hi>Twiſſe,</hi> as above? May a Sinner be ſaved without having any Price of Redemption paid for him, in Caſe he believes? Or does this ſtill remain to be done for him, if he ſhould believe in Chriſt? Or may Salvation be fitly offered to him for whom Chriſt died not, on Condition of his believing, tho' it could not be given to him ſhould he believe? Seeing God knows that it is not in his Power to believe, having no Object ſet before him, on which his Faith may be fixed, or any Eye to look to him, if there were, as is required in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.22. I may very ſeriouſly ſay, I know of no Kindneſs that can be ſhown in ſuch an Offer, <hi>i. e.</hi> an Offer of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation made to Sinners that are not in a ſalvable State.</p>
                  <p>But Chriſt having died for all Men, to purchaſe Salvation for them, on the Terms expreſſed in a moſt gracious Covenant, <hi>well ordered in all Things and ſure,</hi> there is then a Foundation laid for a Treaty of Peace and Reconciliation with ſinful Men, on the Account of a Price of Redemption paid by Jeſus Chriſt, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24, 25, 26. where the Apoſtle having affirmed, that <hi>all have ſinned and come ſhort of the Glory of God,</hi> he adds, that <hi>we are juſtified freely by his Grace, thro' the Redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt: Whom God hath ſet forth to be a Propitiation thro' Faith in his Blood, to declare his Righteouſneſs for the Remiſſion of Sins that are paſt, thro' the Forbearance of God; to declare, I ſay, at this Time, his Righteouſneſs, that God might be juſt and the Juſtifier of him that believeth in Jeſus.</hi> In which Words we are aſſured, That it would not have ſtood with the Juſtice of God to have juſtified a Sinner, tho' a Believer, had not Chriſt been ſet forth, as in the Words expreſſed. And it will no more conſiſt with the Juſtice of God to offer Salvation to a Sinner for whom Chriſt died not, than actually to ſave him without Chriſt's dying for him. And Salvation might have been as well offered to the whole World, if Chriſt had not died at all, as to any one Sinner for whom he died not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="unknown:005439_0062_10183143cdd62ce0"/>How there has been a Foundation laid for the Salvation of ſinful Men, or Way made for it, ſo that it may be done without any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to the Juſtice of God, or any other of his Attributes, yea, with great Honour to them all, has been now ſufficiently declared. And the Reaſon why the Goſpel is not preached, and Salvation offered to all Mankind, is not becauſe all are not in a ſalvable State, or becauſe there is not a Foundation laid in the Mediation of Chriſt for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of any Perſon or People in the World: So that there is no Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that has not committed the unpardonable Sin, who may not be invited to believe in the Son of God, and promiſed, that ſo doing, he ſhall be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>But before I prove, that Salvation is offered to Sinners in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, there are three Things neceſſary to be obſerved to clear up my Way to what is deſigned, and they are theſe here following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Promiſes of Salvation made in the Word of God, to ſuch as are already in a regenerate and juſtified State, are nor conditional, but abſolute. God does not in his Word ſay to any regenerate and juſtified Perſon, that if he ſhall or will believe and repent, he ſhall be juſtified and ſaved. There is no Reaſon or Occaſion for God ſo to ſay to thoſe who have already believed and are paſſed from Dead to Life, and ſo are ſecured from ever coming into Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as in <hi>John</hi> 5.24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. But they are poor unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, unjuſtified Sinners that have, in the Goſpel, a conditional Offer of Salvation made to them. Theſe are there told, that tho' they are at preſent in a State of Sin and Death, yet if they will <hi>believe in the Son of God, they ſhall have Life through his Name,</hi> as in <hi>John</hi> 20.31. but that otherwiſe, they ſhall die in their Sins, <hi>John</hi> 8.24.</p>
                  <p>Indeed there is another Senſe, in which it may be, and is, in Scripture, ſaid to Perſons already in a State of Salvation, it being yet unknown to themſelves and others that they are ſo, <hi>viz.</hi>
                     <q>ſuppoſing ye are now true Believers, and in a regenerate State, ye ſhall be certainly ſaved for ever: As ye be already in a State of Salvation, ſo God will certainly ſave you for the future, perfecting in you all that does concern you.</q>
                     <hi>He that has begun a good Work in you will perfect it to the Day of Chriſt,</hi> as in <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4, 5. Hereto agreeth that of our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 11.26. (as well as <hi>John</hi> 5.24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before mentioned) <hi>He that liveth and believeth in me ſhall never die.</hi> The Faith intended in ſuch Places of Scripture as theſe, is not a Condition on which Salvation is offered, which they already have, but the Qualification by which Perſons may be known to be in a juſtified State; and this Kind of Faith is infuſed in our Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:005439_0063_101830f3aa0af080"/>
as ſhall be hereafter ſhown. Of this Kind of Faith that Text is to be underſtood, <hi>John</hi> 5.24. The ſame Kind of Faith is alſo intended, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.1.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I muſt here alſo obſerve, That whenever any ſpiritual Benefit or good Thing is conditionally promiſed in Scripture, which is never beſtowed on any but ſuch as are eternally ſaved, under the Name of that good Thing, the whole of Man's Salvation is always compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended or compriſed. Salvation is a complex Subject including ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Things in it, all which are firmly connected or knit together, ſo as never to be ſeparated in any Perſon that is ſaved. As thoſe who are not ſaved have none of them, ſo thoſe that are ſaved have them all: Therefore all of them are ſpoken of as <hi>Things accompanying Salvation,</hi> Heb. 6.9. Hence it comes to paſs, that if but one or two of theſe Things are mentioned, in any Promiſe of God, they are all neceſſarily intended and compriſed under the Name of that Thing, or thoſe Things that are expreſly named, as much as if they were all enumerated. There is no Occaſion of particularly naming of them all, becauſe they forever all go together, and he that ſhall have one of them ſhall as certainly have all the reſt. We are not therefore to think, that Salvation is conditionally promiſed in the Texts only wherein it is particularly named: A Promiſe of Pardon of Sin, of Juſtification, of the holy Spirit, of ſpiritual Wiſdom, reſpectively, is as truly a Promiſe of Salvation, as that, <hi>Whoſoever believeth ſhall be ſaved.</hi> So when <hi>Salvation</hi> is in <hi>that Word</hi> promiſed, all Things which <hi>that Term</hi> comprehends, as above, are therein promiſed.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I muſt here further obſerve, That on whatſoever Condition any ſpiritual Benefit compriſed in Man's Salvation, is promiſed, under that Term or Condition, the whole Condition of Man's Salvation, or every Thing required as a Condition of it, is neceſſarily compriſed or implied. The Reaſon of this is very plain. If a Perſon be required to do one Thing, unto which ſeveral others are inſeparably connected, in Reſpect of the Nature of them, and their Relation and Dependance one on another, all thoſe Things muſt needs be virtually required under the Name of that one. Hence whenever God, in Scripture, requires either Faith, Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, Obedience, Prayer, or Fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he requires every one of theſe. A Man cannot do any one of theſe Things without doing them all; therefore God, in requiring any one of them, does vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually require them all; and if he annex a Promiſe to the Performance of this, that, or the other of them, that Promiſe has a Relation to them all, and they are all virtually or implicitly compriſed in the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:005439_0064_1018314702148ff0"/>
Condition of it. Thus if Salvation be conditionally promiſed to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, it is therein conditionally promiſed to Repentance alſo; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe Things are inſeparable in the Nature of them, ſo that one of them cannot be without the other; and the like may be ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning calling on God, ſeeking his Face, fearing his Name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> We therefore find in Scripture, that Promiſes of ſpiritual Bleſſings, or, in a Word, of Salvation, in which all ſuch Bleſſings are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, are made promiſcuouſly to ſuch Actions or Duties as I have juſt now named; but by no Means to any of them excluſively of the reſt, but to this or that in which all the reſt are implied, as being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from it.</p>
                  <p>And it is the more neceſſary thus to conceive, becauſe the Things by God required of Man, are of ſuch a mixt Nature, and (if I may ſo ſpeak) ſo blended together, that they cannot be fully deſcribed or conceived of, without taking into the Idea of them, reſpectively, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing belonging to the reſt. As to inſtance, we have a Promiſe that he that believeth ſhall be ſaved, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. But how can we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of this Faith or Believing; as wholly excluding Repentance, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and Prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the Idea of it? And how can we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine Repentance, without compriſing Faith, Obedience and Prayer in it? Is not Faith exerciſed in Repentance and Prayer? And does not Faith give Life and Vigour to it? <hi>We cannot call on him, on whom we do not believe,</hi> Rom. 10.14. Nor is that worthy the Name of Prayer that has no Faith in it, or is not a Prayer of Faith, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.15. And of Repentance the ſame may be ſaid. All our Duties muſt be mixed with Faith, or they will be unacceptable to God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. and 11.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>6. If we go about nicely to diſtinguiſh theſe Things, we neither edify our ſelves nor others; nay, we do thereby but perplex the true Servants of God. When we ſpeak of Believers, Penitents, ſuch as call on the Name of the Lord, the Righteous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the ſame Perſons are, by theſe Terms, intended. And it is ſo alſo when the Holy Ghoſt ſpeaks of ſuch.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Things being obſerved, and duly conſidered, I need not ſay much to prove, That Salvation is offered or conditionally promiſed unto Sinners in the Goſpel. The moſt that now remains needful to this End, is, to quote and recite ſome of the many Texts of Scripture, wherein it is obvious that they have in the Goſpel ſuch Offers of Salvation made to them; and in what Things the Condition of the new Covenant does conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>Of the Texts I here intend, ſome only need to be inſerted; the reſt I ſhall only refer to, that ſuch as pleaſe may read them. Thoſe
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:005439_0065_101830f6f61a99e8"/>
which I ſhall recite are theſe which here follow, <hi>viz.</hi> Mark 16.15, 16. <hi>Go ye into all the World, and preach the Goſpel to every Creature. He that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</hi> Acts 2.37, 38. <hi>Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their Heart, and ſaid unto</hi> Peter, <hi>and to the Reſt of the Apoſtles, Men and Brethren, What ſhall we do? Then</hi> Peter <hi>ſaid unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt for the Remiſſion of Sins, and ye ſhall receive the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Heb. 5.9. <hi>And being made perfect, he became the Author of eternal Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to all them that obey him.</hi> Rev. 22.14. <hi>Bleſſed are they that do his Commandments, that they may have Right to the Tree of Life, and enter in thro' the Gates into the City.</hi> Rom. 10.13. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall call on the Name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved.</hi> Amos 5.4. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord unto the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Seek ye me, and ye ſhall live.</hi> Prov. 8.17. <hi>They that ſeek me early ſhall find me.</hi> Matth. 7.7, 8. Luke 11.9, 10. <hi>Aſk, and it ſhall be given you, ſeek, and ye ſhall find, knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you. For every one that aſketh, receiveth, and be that ſeeketh, findeth, and to him that knocketh, it ſhall be opened.</hi> Luke 11.13. <hi>If ye then, being evil, know how to give good Gifts to your Children: How much more ſhall your heavenly Father give his holy Spirit to them that aſk him.</hi> Prov. 1.23. <hi>Turn ye at my Reproof: Behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you, I will make known my Words unto you.</hi> Prov. 2.3, 4, 5. <hi>If thou crieſt after Knowledge, and lifteſt up thy Voice for Underſtanding; if thou ſeekeſt her as Silver, and ſearcheſt for her as for hid Treaſures, then ſhalt thou underſtand the Fear of the Lord, and find the Knowledge of God.</hi> Hoſ. 6.3. <hi>Then ſhall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord: His going forth is prepared as the Morning; and he ſhall come upon us as the Rain; as the latter and former Rain upon the Earth.</hi> Gal. 6.9. <hi>And let us not be weary in well doing: For in due Seaſon we ſhall reap, if we faint not.</hi>

                  <p>I ſhall, unto the Scripture Teſtimonies, add two Reaſons to prove, That Salvation is conditionally offered unto Sinners in the Goſpel;
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:005439_0066_1018314d17f368a0"/>
and ſo I ſhall conclude this Chapter, and this firſt Part of my Eſſay. Now my Reaſons are theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If God does not offer, or conditionally promiſe Salvation unto Sinners in the Goſpel of his Son, then he does not ſave them in the Way of a Covenant, which, I think, according to Scripture, he evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently does; and alſo according to the Judgment of the Generality of orthodox Divines. That Sinners are ſaved in the Way of a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, I think, the Word of God does plainly enough hold forth. This in Scripture is call'd the <hi>new Covenant</hi>; and generally, by <hi>Proteſtants, the Covenant of Grace</hi>: Of it we read frequently in the Oracles of God; unto ſome of which Places I ſhall content my ſelf here to refer my Reader, partly becauſe it would take much Time to tranſcribe them; and partly becauſe I hope there are not many who queſtion what I aſſert. This was the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.7. And that in which <hi>David</hi> profeſſeth, is <hi>all his Salvation and all his Deſire,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.5. It is a Covenant made with Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in a wretched State of Sin and Miſery, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8. A better Covenant than the old Covenant was; and a Covenant in which ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Bleſſings are given, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10,—13. and in which everlaſting Mercies are conditionally promiſed to the Keepers of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.17, 18. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.10. and <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39. How then can it be denied, That Salvation is conditionally promiſed in the Goſpel? I expect, that if I meet with Oppoſition in this Particular, I ſhall have many that will ſtand in my Defence; and I am ſure I can produce a great Number to vouch for me, among Divines who have been in good Credit in the Church of God; tho' I know <hi>Antinomians</hi> deny what I here maintain.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If Salvation be not promiſed conditionally unto Sinners, then they have no Ground of Aſſurance, that on the Performance of the Duties which God requireth of them, in order to their Salvation, they ſhall certainly be ſaved. I ſuppoſe it neither can, nor will be denied, that God requires ſome Things of ſinful Men, to be done by them, with an Eye and View to their eternal Salvation: But is it likely to be true, or comfortable to be believed, that God has not promiſed us eternal Life, in Caſe we do what is required of us, in order <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> our obtaining it? We are not yet come to conſider, how far it is in the Power of ſinful Men to perform what is incumbent on them in order to their Salvation. That will be the Buſineſs of the ſecond Part of my Book. But the Queſtion here is, Whether God does not, in
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:005439_0067_101830fbc01fc0e8"/>
Goſpel, conditionally offer to ſave Sinners? And I ſay, if he does not, then Sinners have no Aſſurance given them of it, whatever they do, in order to their obtaining eternal Life: And if ſo, I confeſs they have not ſo good Encouragement to endeavour to comply with their Duty, as I have ever tho't they had, and, as I think, that Text much favours their having, Rom. 4.16. <hi>Therefore it is of Faith, that it might be by Grace; to the End the Promiſe might be ſure to all the Seed, not to that only which is of the Law, but to that alſo which is of the Faith of</hi> Abraham, <hi>who is the Father of us all.</hi>

               <p>I come now to the ſecond Part of my Eſſay; and that which I principally deſigned in it, Namely,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Offer of Salvation made to Sinners in the Goſpel, compriſeth in it an Offer of the Grace given in Regeneration.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now I ſhall endeavour the Explanation and Confirmation of this Truth, in ſeveral Chapters hereafter following.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>INCE I ſuppoſe the Grace of Regeneration to be compriſed in that Salvation, which is offered to Sinners in the Goſpel; it will be neceſſary for me to ſhew what I mean by that which I ſo call: And I ſuppoſe that by a juſt Account o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t, it will appear to be a very eminent Part of that great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which Chriſt has purchaſed, and which God beſtows on all thoſe whom he eternally ſaves.</p>
                  <p>Now I ſhall not here attempt to give a full Account of the great Work of Regeneration, but only to obſerve and aſſert ſome Things
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:005439_0069_101830fdcfcaf418"/>
concerning it, the Obſervation of which will, I think, be to my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Purpoſe; and they are ſuch as here follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In Regeneration there is a real Change wrought in the Soul of a Sinner. (1) That in Regeneration there is a Change wrought, I ſuppoſe will not be denied. (2) This Change is a <hi>real</hi> Change. I ſo call it in this Place, not in Oppoſition to the mere Shew and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of one, but to diſtinguiſh it from a Change <hi>relative.</hi> In the Juſtification of a Sinner, he paſſeth under a relative Change, <hi>viz.</hi> a Change from a State of Guilt, to a State of Peace and Favour with God: But in Regeneration, a Sinner has a real Change wrought in and upon his Perſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He is made in himſelf really better than he was before. (3) The immediate Subject of this Change is the Soul of the Sinner, in whom it is wrought; tho' the ſame does alſo affect his Body, yet I think the immediate Subject of it is the Soul. In it he has a new Heart given to him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Change intended reſpects the Sinner's moral State and Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is not a Change in the Eſſence of his Soul, and Faculties of it; but it reſpects its moral Qualities. The Soul of the Man is eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially the ſame in every Condition. He has not really another Soul given to him, when he is regenerated; but his Soul is made, in a moral Senſe, better than it was; being made holy, whereas it was utterly deſtitute of any true Holineſs; (in a ſtrict and proper Senſe ſo called,) and very full of Sin.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the Change intended, Sinners are delivered from the reigning Power and Dominion of Sin. Tho' they may ſtill have, yea, they really have, a great deal of Sin and Corruption remaining in them, as the Apoſtle ſhews at large in <hi>Rom.</hi> Chap. 7. and more briefly in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. yet they are no longer under the reigning Power and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of their Corruptions, as the ſame Apoſtle aſſerts at large in the 6th Chapter of <hi>Romans,</hi> as any one may ſee, that will pleaſe to read it; eſpecially Verſes 2, 6, 7, 14, 18, and 22. which I need not tranſcribe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. There is in the Change which I ſpeak of, a Principle of ſpiritual Life and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>olineſs infuſed into, or implanted in, the Soul. As Sin is mortified in it, ſo it is quickned and made capable of ſerving God in Newneſs of Life. Indeed it is by that Change which is wrought in it that both theſe are effected.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="unknown:005439_0070_10183150c5c03e88"/>But here I ſhall more particularly obſerve, (1) That in this Change the Soul that was dead in Sin, is quickned: And ſo we are plainly informed in Eph. 2.1. <hi>And you hath he quickned, who were dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins.</hi> And in Col. 2.13. <hi>And you being dead in your Sins, and in the Uncircumciſion of your Fleſh, hath he quickned together with him.</hi> (2) Sinners are thus quickned by having a Principle of ſpiritual Life put into them, or implanted in them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.5, 6. This Principle of ſpiritual Life, or true Holineſs, put into the Souls of Men in their Regeneration, is in Scripture called by ſeveral Names, as <hi>a new Heart and a new Spirit,</hi> Ezek. 36.26. <hi>The Spirit which luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth againſt the Fleſh,</hi> Gal. 5.17. <hi>The new Man,</hi> Eph. 4.24. <hi>The Seed of God,</hi> 1 John 3.9. <hi>The divine Nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> 1 John 3.15. All that have this divine and heavenly Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in them, have already eternal Life, and are <hi>paſſed from Death to Life,</hi> John 5.24. (3) This Principle is that by which ſuch as have it, are inclined and diſpoſed to live unto God, or to live holy and godly Lives. Let it be here obſerved, that Regeneration does not conſiſt in any one or more good Act or Actions, but in God's quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying and diſpoſing the Soul to perform them. This is evident in Eph. 2.10. <hi>We are his Workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works, which God hath before ordained, that we ſhould walk in them.</hi> See, for the ſame Purpoſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27. compared with <hi>Luke</hi> 6.43, 44, 45. The Tree muſt be good before the Fruit can be ſo.</p>
                  <p>The Change under Conſideration is wrought by the Power of the Holy Spirit, the Soul being wholly paſſive in it. Here we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve ſeveral Things, as (1) That the Holy Spirit is the great Agent, who worketh this Change: Therefore ſuch as are ſaid to be born again, are ſaid to be <hi>born of the Spirit,</hi> John 3.5, 6. Our Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is our Sanctification, and this is the Sanctification of the Spirit, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. This Work is not aſcribed to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to exclude the Father and Son, but becauſe it belongs to the Application of Redemption, which, according to the Oeconomy of the divine Perſons, is eſpecially aſcribed to the Holy Spirit. The Regenerate are frequently ſaid to be <hi>born of God</hi>; but then he works this Change by his Spirit. (2) The <hi>mighty Power</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt is put forth in working this Change: By Nothing ſhort <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>eof can this Work be effected. It is, according to the Language of the Scripture, Creation-Work, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.10<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. and Chap. 4.24. And being ſo, the Power of God is put forth in it, even <hi>the xeceeding Greatneſs of his Power to us-ward that believe, according to the Working of his mighty Power; which wrought in Chriſt, when he
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:005439_0071_101831006f9a2070"/>
raiſed him from the Dead,</hi> Eph. 1.19, 20. (3) And from hence it followeth, that the Soul paſſing under this great Change, is wholly paſſive therein. The Soul lends no Hand towards the Working this Change in it. Alas! What can that do? If it had as much Power as ever it had, it could do Nothing in ſuch a difficult Work as this. To God only this is poſſible. This therefore is a Work every where aſcribed to the mighty God. There is no Intimation in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Sinner's doing any Thing towards it himſelf; but the contrary is plainly aſſerted, as in <hi>John</hi> 1.13. where it is ſaid of ſuch as were born of the Spirit, that they were <hi>born not of Blood, nor of the Will of the Fleſh, nor of the Will of Man, but of God.</hi> It followeth (4) That this Change is not wrought by moral Suaſion, but by the immediate Energy of the Holy Ghoſt. By moral Suaſion, I intend, the Word of God, either read or heard, or any moral Motives or Perſuaſions whatſoever. And when I ſay this Change is wrought by the <hi>immediate</hi> Influence of the Holy Ghoſt; I mean, that he uſeth no Inſtrument at all in the Working of it; and that it is a ſuper-natural Change. When it is ſaid by ſome to be a <hi>phyſical</hi> Change, I ſuppoſe they uſe <hi>that Word</hi> to ſignify that it is not wrought by moral Suaſion, as I alſo affirm. And that indeed it is not, is from hence evident, that the Soul is paſſive in it, as I ſhewed under the laſt Head. For it is utterly impoſſible, that the Soul ſhould be wholly paſſive in any Change wrought in or upon it, by moral Suaſion; becauſe the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of moral Suaſion is to move and excite to Action, in a moral or rational Way, in which a Suppoſition of Paſſiveneſs is a Contradiction. When Sinners are ſaid to be <hi>begotten by the Word of Truth,</hi> Jam. 1.18. their <hi>active Converſion</hi> is intended, not that Change, in which the Soul is <hi>paſſive,</hi> betwixt which Divines are wont to diſtinguiſh; and betwixt theſe there is a plain Diſtinction made in Scripture, as has been before obſerved. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18, 19, before quoted.</p>
                  <p>It followeth from the Premiſes, That Regeneration is an inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous Change. The Work of Sanctification is indeed a gradual Work, as plainly appears in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. but the Work of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is not ſo. This is evident from this Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi> that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation is the very Beginning of the Work of Sanctification. When God works the Change called Regeneration, he then begins to ſanctify that Soul that is the Subject of it. Of his Beginning of which Work we read, Phil. 1.6. <hi>He that has begun a good Work in you, will perform it until the Day of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Now the Beginning of any Work cannot be gradual, but muſt needs be inſtantaneous.

Therefore every Man in the World is, at preſent, either in a rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate or in an unregenerate State. There is no ſuch Condition as wherein a Perſon is in neither of theſe, but betwixt both. As, in the natural Birth, a Perſon is as fully born the firſt Day he comes into the World, as when he comes to be of full Stature; ſo it is in the ſpiritual Birth alſo. Thoſe in whom God has wrought a ſaving Change, are as truly converted and born again, as ever they will be, tho' they may after this grow in Grace, and <hi>grow up to the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Stature of perfect Men in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Laſtly, I obſerve here, That the Change wrought in Regeneration is a permanent Change. It is never loſt or fallen from. He that begins this good Work perfects it to the Day of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. before mentioned. The Seed of God remains in all that have it, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. not but that it might be loſt, had not God promiſed that it ſhall not, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. and elſewhere. The Image of God, with which Man was before his Fall endowed, might be loſt, becauſe God had not promiſed that it ſhould not, yea, becauſe God had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that if he ſinned it ſhould; for ſo much was intended in that Threatning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. as I have formerly ſhewed. But now the Caſe is far otherwiſe. God has, in the new Covenant, promiſed never to take his Holy Spirit from his true Saints and Servants, who have experienced the great Work of Regeneration. His Seed ſhall remain in them. They have eternal Life abiding in them; and they ſhall never be deprived of it, <hi>John</hi> 11.26.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. II.
That the Grace of Regeneration which has been deſcribed, is ſuch an eminent Part of Man's Salvation, that Salvation cannot be offered to Sinners, without an Offer of it.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O make good what I here maintain, I will (1) ſhew, that the Grace of Regeneration is a very eminent Part of Man's Salvation. (2) That it being ſo, Salvation cannot be offered to Sinners without an Offer of it.</p>
                  <p>The former of theſe is ſo manifeſt from what has been already ſaid, that there is ſcarce any Occaſion to add any Thing here, for the Confirmation of it. In the firſt Part of this Eſſay, Chap. II. Page 30. I have ſhewed, that Man's Salvation does very eminently conſiſt in his Deliverance from the Power and Dominion of Sin; and in the firſt Chapter of this ſecond Part, that this is done in Man's Regeneration, wherein he is ſet free from the reigning Power and Dominion of his own depraved Nature, which, as he comes into the World, he is a Servant and Slave unto. I have therein alſo ſhewed, that in this great Work, Man is endowed with a Principle of ſpiritual Life, yea, with Life eternal; ſo that he has everlaſting Life as ſoon as he is born again, as in <hi>John</hi> 5.24. Now wherein can Man's Salvation more eminently conſiſt, than in his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſuch Things as theſe done for him? And add hereunto what I have already made good, <hi>viz.</hi> That all this is wholly done for ſinful Men by the bleſſed God himſelf, they doing Nothing in it or to it themſelves, but being wholly paſſive therein. This ſerves further to clear up the Point, that this belongs to the great Salvation, of which God is the Author, and which none can work but he.</p>
                  <p>And how well does this agree with what we have in Scripture, with Relation to the Salvation of God, wrought by Jeſus Chriſt, who came into this lower World <hi>to ſave his People from their Sins,</hi> as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.15. And this was not to ſave them from the Guilt of Sin only, but from the Defilement and Dominion of Sin
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:005439_0074_1018106a3b933498"/>
alſo. He accordingly gave himſelf for us, <hi>that he might redeem us from all Iniquity, and parify to himſelf a peculiar People zealous of good Works,</hi> Tit. 2.14. And this is accompliſhed for ſinful Men when they are, <hi>according to his Mercy, ſaved by the Waſhing of Regeneration, and the Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as in <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.15. By which Words it appears, that their Regeneration is their Salvation: And this was what was by the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> foretold, in Ezek. 36.25. <hi>I will ſprinkle clean Water upon you, and you ſhall be clean: From all your Filthineſs, and from all your Idols will I cleanſe you.</hi> And the next Words ſhew how this was to be done, Ver. 26. <hi>A new Heart alſo will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>In this, as has formerly been ſaid, Man's Salvation does more properly conſiſt, than in his Deliverance from the Guilt of Sin by Chriſt's Blood, which yet is no leſs a Fruit of his Death, than that. By <hi>that,</hi> Way is made for Man's Happineſs: By <hi>this</hi> we are, in Part, actually delivered from the Dominion and Slavery of Sin: By <hi>that</hi> we have a Right given us unto eternal Life: By <hi>this</hi> we are put in actual Poſſeſſion of it, ſo as never to be deprived of it. See <hi>John</hi> 11.26. and Chap. 4.14.</p>
                  <p>Thus we ſee that Man's Salvation does eminently conſiſt in his Regeneration.</p>
                  <p>I now proceed to ſhew, That ſince it is, as has been ſaid, Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be offered unto ſinful Men, without an Offer of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Grace. A Suppoſition of offering Salvation to Sinners, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offering to them that in which Salvation does eminently conſiſt, carries or implies in it a plain Contradiction. Salvation is in Scripture called eternal Life, <hi>John</hi> 3.15, 16. and frequently elſewhere. Now there is no other eternal Life mentioned in Scripture, as by God given to ſinful Men, but that ſpiritual Life which is given in Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. It is the ſame, I doubt not, that is intended by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, in John 17.3. <hi>This is Life eternal, that they may know thee, the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> The Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and Chriſt, in this Place intended, is undoubtedly given in Regeneration, and this is ſaid to be eternal Life, not as being the Condition on which eternal Life is offered, but becauſe eternal Life does formally and eminently conſiſt in it. It is the great Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of all that have it: And they are already in a bleſſed State that are the Subjects of it. So was <hi>Peter,</hi> Matth. 16.27. <hi>Bleſſed art thou</hi> Simon Bar-jona: <hi>For Fleſh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee, but my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Such as ſo know God and Chriſt may ſay, as in 1 John 5.20. <hi>We know that the Son of God is c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>me, and
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:005439_0075_1018310991c0bd20"/>
hath given us an Underſtanding, that we ſhould know him that is true: And we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This is the true God and eternal Life. Perſons thus qualified in their Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, are already poſſeſſed of the ſame Kind of Life, which all the Saints ſhall live in Heaven for ever. For Grace here and Glory hereafter differ only <hi>gradually,</hi> nor <hi>ſpecifically,</hi> not in Kind but in Degrees; and Grace in all its Degrees is called Glory.</p>
                  <p>The Impoſſibility of offering Salvation to ſinful Men, without offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Grace of Regeneration to them, may be thus made further evident: God cannot be truly ſaid to offer Salvation to Sinners with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offering to them whatſoever is neceſſary on his Part, in order to their Salvation. God may offer Salvation to Sinners without offering to them what is neceſſary on their Part, in order to their Salvation, ſuch as is the Condition required of them in order to it: But an Offer of Salvation, without an Offer of what is abſolutely neceſſary to it, on the Part of him, by whom the Offer is ſuppoſed to be made, ſeemeth utterly impoſſible. There may be indeed the Shew of ſuch an Offer, but really there can be none. Such a ſeeming Offer cannot be ſincere. If a Phyſician in whoſe Power alone it is to heal a ſick Man, ſhould tell him he would beſtow a plentiful Eſtate upon him, provided he would do ſomething, which a Man in Health only can do, and not withal offer to reſtore him to Health; would any one ſay, that <hi>that</hi> Phyſician was ſincere and kind, in that ſeeming Offer? Or would he not rather be guilty of mocking and tantalizing him therein. I do not charge the bleſſed God with dealing thus with ſinful Men, but am ſhewing that he does not. A better Account may be given of his Dealings with them than this is, as by the Help of God, I hope to make evident in the Sequel of this Diſcourſe.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. Concerning the Nature of that Faith and Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to which the Promiſe of eternal Life is, in this Diſcourſe, ſuppoſed to be made.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T has been already ſaid, That the Condition on which Salvation is promiſed to Sinners in the Goſpel, does include or compriſe in it Faith, Repentance, Obedience, Seeking of God, and in a Word, every Thing, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it be, that is ſo required of them, to whom the Goſpel is preached, that God will not ſave them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. But this is too general an Account of the Nature o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the Condition of the new Covenant, or of the Condition required of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in order to their Salvation; which is the Reaſon of what is here propoſed to Conſideration.</p>
                  <p>For whereas Faith, Repentance, Obedience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or by whatever other Names theſe Acts are called, are of two Sorts or Kinds, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the different States Perſons are in, <hi>viz.</hi> either a State of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, I mean that Condition that all Mankind are in, while unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, or not born of the Spirit: Or a regenerate and juſtified Eſtate, ſuch as they are in, who are born of God and become new Creatures. Whereas, I ſay, ſuch Acts as in Scripture, go by the Names of Faith, Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do ſpecifically differ, according to the different State of the Perſons, by whom they are performed; it muſt needs be neceſſary to enquire, which of theſe two Kinds of Acts they are, which are required of Sinners in order to their Salvation; and to do this is the Buſineſs of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>Now, whereas I maintain in this Eſſay, That the Grace of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration is compriſed in the Salvation conditionally offered in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, it will evidently follow on this Suppoſition, That the Faith and Repentance required in the Covenant of Grace, as the Condition on which Salvation is offered to us, cannot be of that Kind which is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed by none but regenerate and juſtified Perſons; for ſo, Sinners ſhould be in a State of Salvation before they perform the Condition
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:005439_0077_1018310b616a8120"/>
required of them, in order to their being ſaved; contrary to Reaſon and to Scripture alſo; for it is by Faith that we are juſtified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.28. and 5.1. And the Wrath of God abideth on Sinners till they believe, <hi>John</hi> 3.36. I therefore conclude, That whatever it be, and by what Names ſoever call'd, that is required of Sinners in order to their being ſaved, is what they muſt perform before they are in a State of Salvation, and ſo while they are in an unregenerate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtified State: Which is no more than to ſay, before God ſaves them. And when awakened Sinners aſk, what they ſhall do to be ſaved? as in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. and 16.30. this is plainly ſuppoſed in their Inquiry; and they are confirmed in this by the Anſwer given to them, being ſuitable to the Meaning of their Queſtion.</p>
                  <p>In order therefore to my ſupporting the Hypotheſis I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to defend, it will be neceſſary that I do two Things, <hi>viz.</hi> (1) Prove it to be impoſſible, that the Condition required of us ſhould conſiſt in any Act or Acts to be performed by us, being already born again, and by virtue of that Grace which in our Regeneration we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. (2) That it is very poſſible, that the Condition to this End required of ſinful Men, ſhould be performed by them, before they are born of the Spirit; and that, by virtue of ſuch Aids and Influences as God may afford them by his Word and Spirit, without beſtowing the Grace of Regeneration on them; and before they receive this Grace: And both theſe Things I ſhall have Occaſion to endeavour to confirm in the Proſecution of the Work, in which I am now engaged. But my preſent Deſign in this Chapter, is briefly to conſider the Nature of thoſe Acts, which, I ſay, are compriſed in the Condition on which God offers to ſave Sinners; and wherein they differ from thoſe, which, tho' much better, are not, yea, cannot be, required to that End.</p>
                  <p>Now here I will <hi>firſt</hi> ſhew, what the fundamental Ground and Reaſon of the Difference that is between them, is: And then, <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> wherein the Difference does appear, ſo far as I am able to diſcern and diſcover it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As to the Reaſon and Ground of the Difference betwixt the Acts now to be compared, the Difficulty ſeems not to be very great; it being evident, that the Reaſon thereof is this, that the Acts of ſuch as are in a regenerate and juſtified Eſtate, do, or may, flow from an inward Principle of true Holineſs; or from a Principle of ſpiritual Life, which, in their new Birth, they have been endowed
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:005439_0078_1018315c248891d0"/>
withal, called in Scripture, as has been declared, the <hi>new Man,</hi> the <hi>new Creature,</hi> a <hi>new Heart,</hi> a <hi>new Spirit,</hi> the <hi>Seed of God,</hi> the <hi>divine Nature,</hi> &amp;c. This Principle, being a ſpiritual and holy Thing, deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates the Perſons ſpiritual and holy, who are the Subjects of it; and ſuch as they are, their Actions are, or may be alſo, like the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple from which they proceed. On the other Hand, ſuch as are in a State of Nature, and ſo deſtitute of any ſuch heavenly and divine Principle, as has been now mentioned; and ſo not ſpiritual, but car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, do not, cannot, perform any ſuch ſpiritual and holy Actions, as ſuch as are regenerate can do: For Actions cannot be better than the Principle which they proceed or ſpring from. We are accordingly told, <hi>that that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit, and that which is born of the Fleſh is Fleſh,</hi> John 3.6. And with this agrees that in Rom. 8.8. <hi>They that are in the Fleſh cannot pleaſe God</hi>: And that alſo 1 Cor. 2.14, 15. <hi>The natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God: For they are Fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned. But he that is ſpiritual judgeth all Things,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Agreeably hereunto the State of Mankind, with Relation to their Actions good and bad, ſeems to be fully and plainly ſet forth by our Saviour, Luke 6.43, 44, 45. <hi>For a good Tree bringeth not forth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Fruit: Neither doth a corrupt Tree bring forth good Fruit. For every Tree is known by his own Fruit: For of Thorns Men do not gather Figs, not of a Bramble-Buſh gather they Grapes. A good Man, out of the good Treaſure of his Heart, bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil Man, out of the evil Treaſure of his Heart, bringeth forth that which is evil: For of the Abundance of the Heart the Mouth ſpeaketh.</hi> We may doubtleſs, from the Scriptures that have been mentioned, conclude it to be a Truth, That, in a proper and ſtrict Senſe, no Actions are holy and good, but what are performed by good or godly Perſons, ſuch as are <hi>born of God,</hi> or <hi>born of the Spirit</hi>; and which flow from an inward Principle of ſpiritual Life, or true Holineſs.</p>
                  <p>Yet on the other Hand it may be truly affirmed, that ſome Actions which may be, and are, performed by Perſons in an unregenerate State, which have ſomething of Goodneſs in them; (tho' of an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour Kind) and are ſo far acceptable to God, by whom Actions are weighed, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.3. and who perfectly knows what of Good or Evil there is in any of them, and values them accordingly, approving them ſo far as they are good, and abhorring them ſo far forth as they are evil. But of this more hereafter: At preſent my Buſineſs is to ſhew, that there is a <hi>real</hi> Difference betwixt the good Actions of the
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:005439_0079_1018310d74eb2a38"/>
Regenerate, and the beſt that can be performed by unregenerate Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; and wherein that Difference lieth.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore,</p>
                  <p>I ſhall here, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> mention three Things, wherein I think the good Actions of the Regenerate greatly differ, and that ſpecifically, from any that can be performed by unregenerate Perſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And <hi>firſt,</hi> the Knowledge which the Regenerate have of God and ſpiritual Things is <hi>experimental,</hi> and their other Actions proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from ſuch Knowledge, ſuitable to it; but not ſo the Unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate.</p>
                  <p>I will here conſider, <hi>firſt,</hi> that <hi>Knowledge</hi> which the Regenerate have of God and Things ſpiritual; and then their other Actions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding therefrom.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay, the Knowledge of the Regenerate is experimental; which the Knowledge of the Unregenerate is not. Now to clear up this, we may obſerve (1) That the Elect of God have not, in their Converſion, any other objective Revelation of God, than the Non-Elect, who are never ſavingly converted. The external Revelation of divine Objects and Truths, which we have in the holy Scriptures, is a ſufficient Ground for the Belief and aſſured Knowledge of them; ſo that thoſe who do not believe and know them, as they ought to do, cannot plead, that they have not ſufficient Evidence of the Truth and Reality of them. If they could truly ſo plead, this would be a good Reaſon for their not believing them, which they evidently cannot have, (I ſpeak of thoſe who enjoy the Goſpel) as appears in <hi>Luke</hi> 16.27, —31. Nay, I ſuppoſe it cannot be proved, that when the Elect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, with a Kind of Faith peculiar to them, they have any other objective Revelation of divine Truths, and Evidence to ground their Faith on, than thoſe have who never ſo believe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Perſons enjoying ſuch objective Revelation and Evidence of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and ſpiritual Things, need Nothing more of that Kind, in order to believing and knowing them in a gracious and holy Manner, than is afforded to thoſe who never ſo believe. What is further neceſſary in order thereunto, is done for them in Regeneration or paſſive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; (of which before) and in the Aſſiſtance they have in exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing the Grace they have ſo received; unto all which no new ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jective Revelation is required. This, I ſay, is done by God's giving unto Men an <hi>Heart to know him,</hi> Jer. 24.7. and by his <hi>opening their Eyes, to behold wondrous Things out of his Law,</hi> Pſal. 119.18. And
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:005439_0080_1018316191216810"/>
this God does by working a ſubjective Change; that is, he rectifies the Organ, and reſtores the depraved Faculty. He does it not by ſending new Light, in other objective Revelations, which the Subjects of ſuch a Change had not before: For it is plainly ſuppoſed in the Places but now quoted, that Perſons, for whom this is done, have, before the doing it for them, a ſufficient objective Revelation of the Things which they are required to believe and know.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Knowledge of ſpiritual Things, in this Way obtained, is <hi>experimental,</hi> and ſuch as none but the Regenerate have or can have. All the Knowledge which the Unregenerate have, or can have, of divine and ſpiritual Things, called the <hi>deep Things of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 2.10, is quite of another Kind, <hi>viz.</hi> only by a natural Aſſent on Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony unto the Truth of the Things believed. And their Aſſurance of ſuch Things, in this Way, can ariſe no higher than their Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of him that teſtifies will lay a Foundation for, and the Reaſons which they do, or may ſee of the Credibility of the Things teſtified, will be ſufficient to produce; which ſometimes may be a conſiderable Meaſure of Certainty: Yet this is vaſtly different from, and no Ways comparable to, that experimental Knowledge which the Regenerate do attain.</p>
                  <p>The Difference betwixt the two Kinds of Knowledge I am ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, is, I ſay, very great and plain, as the Difference is great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt what we know by Report only, and what we know experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally, by Seeing, Feeling, Taſting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.1. A ſick Perſon, whoſe Appetite is vitiated, and who has loſt his Reliſh of Meat and Drink; tho' he can believe ſuch as commend this and the other Sort of either, becauſe he reckons them credible; yet cannot have the ſame Aſſurance of the Goodneſs of the Things he has often heard praiſed, as he has, who being in Health can, and does, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the Sweetneſs of the Things he feeds on, and by which he is ſtrengthned and nouriſhed, and ſo certainly knows the Benefit of.</p>
                  <p>Thus Sin is a Diſeaſe, which has deprived Mankind of their Appetite and Reliſh of ſpiritual Things; therefore <hi>the carnal Mind is Enmity againſt God,</hi> Rom. 8.7. with which we may compare, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. but lately mentioned. But in Regeneration, this woful Diſtemper of Men's Souls is, in a good Meaſure, cured; ſo that they find and experience the Certainty and Excellency of ſpiritual Objects; and can converſe with them with Pleaſure and Delight, as the Scriptures plentifully ſhew. Such as pleaſe may read and compare, <hi>Job</hi> 42.5, 6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2, 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.97. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.1. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="66" facs="unknown:005439_0081_10183110775a2e68"/>From this experimental Knowledge called <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual Underſtanding,</hi> Col. 1.9. there always proceed ſuch Actions as are ſuitable thereunto, and as become thoſe that are ſpiritually wiſe, ſuch as are the genuine Fruits and proper Effects of <hi>the Knowledge of the Holy,</hi> mention'd <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.10. <hi>Job</hi> 28.28. alſo <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another Thing wherein, I think, the good Actions of the Regenerate differ from the beſt that can be performed by any unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate Perſons, is this, that they are performed out of ſuch a Love to God, as has his infinite Perfections for the formal Reaſon and Ground of it. Here I ſhall obſerve, (1) That unregenerate Perſons may perform Actions that are materially good, tho' they have no Love to God at all; yea, tho' they have no Regard to him. It is not to be doubted, but that unregenerate Sinners may believe there is a God; and have a Fear and Dread of him, as well as Devils, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.19. And out of ſuch a Fear of him they may yield Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Commands, tho' they love him not. (2) Unregenerate Perſons may have ſome Kind of Love to God, which may put them on doing many Things which he requires them to do. There be ſome unregenerate Perſons that have a very conſiderable Reſpect and Veneration for the great God that made them, and continually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves them. They therefore love not to hear his Name blaſphemed; and the Kindneſs they may apprehend they have received from him, may influence them to do many Things, which they may think good in themſelves, and pleaſing in his Sight; and they may apprehend that God is ſo gracious as to reward them well for the good Works which they perform. There may be in the Unregenerate, a Kind of natural Love to God, anſwerable to the Apprehenſions they have of ſome Goodneſs in him, as well as ſuch a Love to their Neighbours; even common Grace may go thus far. (3) But no unregenerate Perſon ever loved and obeyed God, on the Account of the admirable Perfections of his Nature; ſo that his Perſuaſion of his infinite Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ariſing from his own experimental Acquaintance with him, was the formal Reaſon of this his Love to him, and Deſire to do that which would pleaſe him; ſo that they would do the ſame, tho' they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves had no Benefit by it. I ſuppoſe, That he that cannot do thus, is ſtill in a State of Nature, and does not know and love God in a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Manner: And has not, in the Senſe of the Scripture, <hi>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ſted that the Lord is gracious,</hi> 1 Pet. 2, 3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.8.</p>

                     <pb n="67" facs="unknown:005439_0082_10183164cbc313f0"/>3. I think the Regenerate only can perform good Actions, with an Aim and Deſign to glorify God, as the ultimate End of them. There is, as I think, no Doubt to be made, but that the Unregenerate may, and ſometimes do, aim at God's Glory, in ſome of their Actions. Such may be perſuaded, That to glorify God <hi>here,</hi> is the only Way to obtain eternal Life <hi>hereafter</hi>; and this may put them upon endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to glorify God's Name. But none but a gracious Soul can aim at God's Glory, as the ultimate End of what he does; and tho' he ſhould ſee no Advantage to himſelf by it. But I think every truly holy Soul would do this. However, God does not require us to aim at his Glory, without any Eye or View to our own Advantage: Theſe are Things, by God himſelf, ſo joined together, that we ought not to go about to ſeperate them.</p>
                  <p>So much may ſuffice to have ſaid in this Place, concerning the Difference of the gracious and holy Actions of thoſe who are already paſſed from Death to Life, and thoſe Actions in which, I ſuppoſe, the Condition, on which Salvation is offered unto Sinners, does conſiſt. This will neceſſarily be further ſpoken to hereafter.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IV. That <hi>GOD,</hi> in offering <hi>JESUS CHRIST,</hi> with all his Benefits, to ſinful Men, muſt needs offer them the Grace of <hi>Regeneration.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT there is in the Goſpel, a gracious Offer of Jeſus Chriſt, with all his Benefits, made to Sinners, is, I think, in the Miniſtry of the Word of God, very frequently aſſerted, by orthodox Preachers of the Goſpel: How agreable to Truth, I ſhall in this Chapter conſider: And whether, if this be true, it will not from thence follow, That Sinners have in the Goſpel, an Offer of the Grace of Regeneration made to them; which is the Point I am endeavouring to maintain.</p>
                  <p>Now in order to the clearing up of this Truth, I ſhall (1) ſhew, That there is, in the Goſpel, an Offer of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf to Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. (2) That, having an Offer of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, they have, with him, an Offer of all his Benefits. (3) That, having an Offer of
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:005439_0083_10183115d2e00030"/>
all his Benefits, they muſt needs have an Offer of the Grace of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation. To theſe Things I will ſpeak ſeverally.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay Sinners have in the Goſpel an Offer of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf made to them.</p>
                  <p>This I ſhall take for granted, it being, as I ſuppoſe, generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all that own that Sinners have Salvation conditionally offered to them. In <hi>John</hi> 1.11, 12. we have a plain Proof of this Truth.</p>
                  <p>But it may be proper here to obſerve, That when it is ſaid, that Sinners have in the Goſpel an Offer of Jeſus Chriſt, we muſt not underſtand merely his Perſon, God-Man; but his Perſon conſidered as cloathed with his Office of Mediator betwixt God and Mankind; and every Way qualified and enclined to execute that Office; yea, as having undertaken it on the Behalf of all that will receive him, or come up to the Terms on which he is offered to them: Theſe Names, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> are plainly expreſſive of the Office he bears, and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anointed, or ſet apart to the Execution of it; the Name <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſignifying a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and that of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> his being anointed or ſet apart to his Office: And whenever we ſpeak of Jeſus Chriſt, as being offered unto Sinners, we ſhould not think his Perſon only to be underſtood, but his Perſon cloathed with the Office of a Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, as in Matth. 1.21. <hi>Thou ſhalt call his Name</hi> JESUS; <hi>for he ſhall ſave his People from their Sins.</hi> Now this Office of a Saviour includes in it thoſe of Prieſt, Prophet, and King.</p>
                  <p>Nor is Jeſus Chriſt, who is offered unto Sinners, to be conſidered meerly as cloathed with the Office of a Mediator, but as perfectly qualified for the Execution of it, or Accompliſhment of the Work he has undertaken to perform, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>bringing many Sons unto Glory,</hi> Heb. 2.10. To this End <hi>he was made perfect through Sufferings,</hi> as is ſaid in the ſame Verſe; not only as hereby he became a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of Patience to his ſuffering Saints, but more eſpecially as by this he laid the Foundation of all that ſtill remained neceſſary, in order to their being bro't into a State of perfect Happineſs and Glory. Unto this that well agreeth, 1 Pet. 3.18. <hi>For Chriſt alſo once ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for Sins, the Juſt for the Unjuſt: that he might bring us to God, being put to Death in the Fleſh, but quickened by the Spirit.</hi> To the ſame Purpoſe it is ſaid of him, Heb. 5.9. That <hi>being made perfect, he became the Author of eternal Salvation unto all them that obey him.</hi> The Price of Man's Redemption being once paid, their great Saviour might comfortably go on and accompliſh all that was further neceſſary
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:005439_0084_10183166560fd3c0"/>
in order to their Happineſs, in their effectual Calling, Juſtification, and Regeneration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When Jeſus Chriſt is ſpoken of, as offered to Sinners, we muſt alſo conſider him as filled with all that Good which is treaſured up in him, to be communicated to all thoſe whom he eternally ſaves. <hi>For it hath pleaſed the Father, that in him all Fulneſs ſhould dwell,</hi> Col. 1.19. And <hi>in him are hid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge,</hi> Chap. 2.30. And we are told, in John 1.14. That he was <hi>full of Grace and Truth.</hi> And in verſe 16. ſuch as have an Intereſt in him are bro't in ſaying, <hi>Of his Fulneſs have all we received, and Grace for Grace.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is indeed that <hi>Fountain</hi> of ſpiritual Good, of which we read, <hi>Zech.</hi> 13.1. In him therefore <hi>all our Springs are,</hi> Pſal. 87.7. He is a full Repoſitory of all thoſe good Things that needy Souls can deſire, and look out after; and unto all, to whom he is Offered, he is offered full as he is.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Together with, and in Jeſus Chriſt, Sinners have an Offer of <hi>all his Benefits.</hi> This is indeed a plain Conſequence of what is above ſaid, <hi>viz.</hi> That Sinners have an Offer of Chriſt with all his Fulneſs. But for the further clearing of this Point, we muſt here conſider, (1) What we may here underſtand by Chriſt's Benefits. (2) How it appears that theſe are all offered unto Sinners in and with him.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) Let us here conſider what we are to underſtand by Chriſt's Benefits. Now unto this, in a Word, I ſay, That by theſe Benefits, I underſtand, all thoſe ſpecial and everlaſting Mercies, which God beſtows on all, and only thoſe, whom he eternally ſaves; and which are called <hi>Things that accompany Salvation,</hi> Heb. 6.9. What theſe Things are, I have more particularly ſhown, Part I. and Chap. II. of this Eſſay, where it appears, Page 30. That Man's Salvation contains in it, as an eminent Part of it, his Deliverance from the reigning Power and Dominion of Sin, in and by his Regeneration. Such as pleaſe may ſee what is there ſaid, but much rather what the Scripture ſays, <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.5.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) I muſt ſhew that all theſe Benefits, not any one of them ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, are in the Goſpel offered unto Sinners in and with Jeſus Chriſt. They cannot be either offered or given in any other Way, than that now expreſs'd. I mean, That, according to the Way which God has ſtated in the Goſpel, they cannot. The natural Order and Reaſon of Things will not admit that they ſhould. For,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="unknown:005439_0085_10183118b5d7b4e8"/>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Theſe Things being all repoſited in Chriſt, as has been ſhewn, there can, I ſuppoſe, be no Way ſhewed, how any Perſon can be a Partaker of any of them, without being made Partaker of Jeſus Chriſt, in whom they are all treaſured up. Thoſe therefore that have an Intereſt in any of them, are ſaid in Scripture to have the ſame in him. And it would be prepoſterous in any Perſon to deſire, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to obtain, any of them, in any other Way, than by getting an Intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt himſelf. Thoſe that have an Intereſt in any one of thoſe Things, are therefore in Scripture ſaid to have them in him. In him they have their Righteouſneſs, and Strength, and their Life, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.24, 25. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.11. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Union with Chriſt is therefore neceſſary in order to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons being Partakers of any of theſe Benefits. Never did any one Soul partake of any of them, without being firſt united to Chriſt. They are all conveyed from him as the Head of his Church, which is his Body, unto the Members of it; or as from a Vine to it's Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. For this the Scriptures are full and plain, as may be ſeen, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18, 19. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.19. <hi>John</hi> 1.16. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22, 23. See alſo <hi>John</hi> 15.1,—6.</p>
                  <p>But there being ſeveral Senſes in which Perſons may be ſaid to be united to Jeſus Chriſt, I ſhall have Occaſion in my next Chapter diſtinctly to conſider them, and ſhew, in what Senſe Perſons muſt be united to Jeſus Chriſt, before they can partake of any of his ſpecial Benefits. At Preſent it is ſufficient to my Purpoſe that the Scriptures are plain and full, That Union with, or to, him is neceſſary to that End; and that he muſt become our's in Order to our partaking of any of his ſpecial Favours: Even as a Woman muſt marry a Man, in order to her having ſuch an Intereſt in his Eſtate, as Wives have in the Eſtate of their Huſbands. And thus much may ſuffice for my fourth Chapter.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. V. That neither the Grace of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> nor any Act flowing from it, or by which it is implied, is the Condition on which Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is offered to Sinners, and conſequently the ſame muſt be comprehended in the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation offered to them.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING in the foregoing Chapter endeavoured to prove, That Sinners have in the Goſpel, an Offer of Jeſus Chriſt and all his Benefits made to them; and conſequently, of Regeneration, which is one of the principal of them: I am apprehenſive there is one Exception that will be apt to be made againſt the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument there inſiſted on, <hi>viz.</hi> That Regeneration itſelf, (or which is in Effect the ſame Thing, an Act of Faith flowing from it, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it) is the Condition on which the Offer of Salvation is made; and conſequently cannot be compriſed in the Salvation offered; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe one and the ſame Thing cannot be both the Condition on which Salvation is offered, and the Benefit itſelf to be obtained on that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; I intend, in this Chapter, not only to ſhow the Faultineſs of ſuch an Objection; but alſo to make ſome Advantage of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence made uſe of in it, for the Support of the Hypotheſis which it is deſigned to overthrow.</p>
                  <p>I then readily acknowledge, That the ſame Thing cannot be both the Condition on which Salvation is offered, and either a Part or the Whole of the Salvation offered on it. If therefore it can be proved, That either Regeneration itſelf, or any Act flowing from it or implyed in it, is required of Sinners, as the Condition on which Salvation is offered to them, it will plainly follow, that it can be no Part of the Salvation, on that Condition offered.—But then, on the other
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:005439_0087_1018311b319924c0"/>
Hand, if it is or may be ſufficiently proved, that Regeneration is a Part, and an eminent and principal Part too, of the Salvation offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Goſpel, it will as firmly follow, that it cannot be the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition on which God offers that Salvation. If therefore I have proved, as I think I have, That Regeneration is compriſed in the Salvation of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to Sinners; or if I can ſtill, as I intend, make good this Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then it will appear not to be compriſed or implied in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. However, if I have not yet proved this in the Way expreſſed, I hope I ſhall ſufficiently evince it in what remains to be ſpoken in this Chapter.</p>
                  <p>To go on therefore, there are now two Things before me to be made good, <hi>viz.</hi> (1) That neither the Grace of Regeneration, nor any Act flowing from it, can be the Condition on which Salvation is offered to Sinners. (2) That from hence this Concluſion followeth, That the Grace given in Regeneration muſt needs be compriſed in the Salvation offered: — And theſe Things I ſhall endeavour ſeverally to illuſtrate and confirm.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I will endeavour to ſhew that neither the Grace of Regeneration, nor any Act flowing from it, and ſo involved and implied in it, can be the Condition on which Salvation is offered, as above.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) I ſay, the Grace of Regeneration itſelf, cannot be the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on which God offers Salvation to ſinful Men. For <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Condition on which Salvation is offered to Sinners, is ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them to be done by them, which the Grace of Regeneration is not. The Condition required of Sinners is ſomething which they are directed to do, in Anſwer to ſuch Enquiries of awakened Souls as theſe, <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> Acts 2.37. and, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> Acts 16.30. It is ſomething called in Scripture <hi>Believing, Repenting, Obeying, Seeking the Lord, Calling on his Name,</hi> &amp;c. as I have formerly ſhewed. But the Grace of Regeneration is no act at all, either of God, or of the Sinner, tho' it be God's Gift. It is an infuſed Habit or Principle, by which they that have it are diſpoſed to act as they ſhould do, not their acting. For it is called in Scripture, <hi>a new Heart, a new Spirit, the new Creature, the Seed of God, the Image of God, the divine Nature,</hi> &amp;c. none of which Words or Names ſignify Actions, but a Principle of Grace or Holineſs wrought in Men's Souls by the Holy Spirit, <hi>creating them anew in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works, that they ſhould walk in them,</hi> Eph. 2.10. and Ezek. 36.26, 27. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Grace of Regeneration cannot be the Condition on
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:005439_0088_10181068058ab768"/>
which Salvation is offered to Sinners, becauſe they cannot have it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are in a State of Salvation; which to its being a Condition on which Salvation is offered, is neceſſarily required. But this will by and by be made further evident.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) No Act flowing from the Grace of Regeneration, or imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, can be the Condition on which Salvation is offered. No ſuch Act, I mean, as any Perſon performs by the Help of that Grace, which, in his Regeneration, he receives. And to make good what I here aſſert, I will ſhew, (1) That if that could be which is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, then a Sinner might be vitally united to Jeſus Chriſt, while he has no Covenant-Intereſt in him. And (2) Then alſo might a Sinner be <hi>born of God,</hi> and <hi>born of the Spirit,</hi> before he is juſtified by the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to him: Neither of which can be true, or may by any Means be admitted.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay, if any Act, or Acts, flowing from the Grace of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, or implying it, were the Condition on which Salvation is offered, then it would follow, that a Perſon may be <hi>vitally</hi> united to Chriſt before he has any Covenant-Intereſt in him and his Benefits; which muſt be denied. I ſuppoſe there are ſcarce any of our Divines that will deny this Conſequence, becauſe the Concluſion or Inference is, what they generally hold and maintain: For they think an Act of Faith, flowing from a Principle of Grace given in Regeneration, is required in order to our Salvation; nor do they at all doubt, but that all in whom a Principle of Grace is wrought, are vitally united unto Chriſt, and that before they have any Covenant-Intereſt in him: For they ſuppoſe it to be impoſſible, that any Perſon ſhould have a Covenant-Intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt that has not believed in him, and this with that Kind of Faith which is given in Regeneration; and which can be only exerted by a regenerate Soul. It is not therefore ſuppoſed, that there is any Abſurdity in the Inference I draw from the Propoſition I oppoſe. What, therefore, is here incumbent on me is to ſhow, that it is impoſſible that any Perſon ſhould be vitally united to Jeſus Chriſt, before he has a Covenant-Intereſt in him; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſuch a Right to his Benefits alſo.</p>
                  <p>I will therefore here endeavour to make it manifeſt, that this is impoſſible. And to this End I will briefly ſhew (1) What I take to be imported in a vital Union to Jeſus Chriſt. (2) What I intend by a Covenant-Intereſt in him. And then I will ſhew (3) How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:005439_0089_101831200990e210"/>
it is to imagine, That a Perſon that has not ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt and his Benefits, may yet be vitally united to him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And <hi>firſt,</hi> I will here ſhew, what I ſuppoſe to be imported in that vital Union with Jeſus Chriſt, whereof I here ſpeak.</p>
                  <p>Now to this I ſay, (1) That this imports that the great Work of Regeneration is really wrought in ſuch a Soul; or that he is born of God, born of the Spirit; that God has given him a new Heart, and a new Spirit; reſtored his Image in him, which he had loſt by the Fall; endowed him with a Principle of ſpiritual Life; planted the Seed of Grace in his Soul; made him Partaker of the divine Nature. All this muſt needs be implied in a vital Union with Jeſus Chriſt: For it is by the Soul's Conformity to the Image of the Son of God, or by his having Chriſt formed in him, that this his Union with him is bro't about or effected. We are therefore told, that <hi>he that is joined to the Lord is one Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.17. (2) Such as theſe are actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt, having the Spirit of God, Father and Son, dwelling in them, as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15, 16, 17, and ver. 19. And God dwells and walks in them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. So that they are become an Habitation of God thro' the Spirit, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.22. and Chriſt lives in them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. (3) Such as theſe have already eternal Life; and ſhall not come into Condemnation, but are already paſſed from Death to Life, and have eternal Life abiding in them, ſo that they ſhall never die. See <hi>John</hi> 5.24. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.14, 15. and Chap. 5.12. alſo <hi>John</hi> 11. 25, 26. (4) Such as theſe God has already began to glorify, as plainly appears, 2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>The Spirit of God and of Glory reſteth on them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. I muſt next ſhew, what I intend by a Covenant-Intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt and his Benefits: And here, in general, I ſay, I hereby intend a juſt Right and Title to them, by the Promiſes of God in the new Covenant; and that unto Men's having ſuch a Right, their Performance of the Condition on which Jeſus Chriſt and his Benefits are offered, or conditionally promiſed, is abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Now, with Reſpect to this Intereſt in, or Right to, Chriſt and his Benefits, I think it neceſſary to ſay ſeveral Things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. And <hi>firſt,</hi> this ſuppoſeth, that there are, in the Goſpel, condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Offers and Promiſes made of theſe Things unto ſinful Men, plainly importing, that they ſhall become theirs on the Performance of the Condition or Conditions to that End required of them. But on this I need not enlarge, having before ſpoken fully to it.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="75" facs="unknown:005439_0090_10183171f395bbf8"/>2. That theſe Conditions muſt be performed before a Right can be had to the Things conditionally promiſed. The very Notion of a conditional Offer or Promiſe does plainly imply ſo much.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I acknowledge, that, according to my Hypotheſis, a Sinner muſt, in order to his having ſuch a Right, perform the now intended Condition, before he has the great Work of Regeneration wrought in him; and conſequently, Strength given to him in his Regeneration is not required in order to it: Yet I believe, that, in order to this, a Sinner needs the Help and Influences of God, by his Word and Spirit.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Sinners can have no Right to any of the Benefits purchaſed by Jeſus Chriſt for them, and laid up in him, 'till they have a Right to, and Intereſt in himſelf, as has been already ſhewed.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Union with Jeſus Chriſt is alſo abſolutely neceſſary, in order to our partaking of his ſpecial Benefits. They are all communicated by, and derived from him, as he is Head of his Church, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18, 19. and Chap. 2.19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22, 23. alſo <hi>John</hi> 15. from the Beginning to Verſe 6.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. The Grace of Regeneration cannot be received from Chriſt, by his People, as their <hi>vital Head,</hi> or as being in ſuch a vital Union with him as I lately deſcribed. This is moſt obvious, becauſe no Perſon is ſo united to him, 'till he is regenerate or born again; it being by the Beſtowment of the Grace of Regeneration on any Soul, that ſuch an Union with Chriſt is brought about or effected. It is by putting his holy Spirit into ſome of the Children of Men, that Jeſus Chriſt unites them to himſelf; and thus all that are <hi>joined to the Lord are one Spirit</hi> with him: And hence it appears, that they receive not the Grace of Regeneration from him, as being, in this Senſe their Head; but to the End he may be ſo, and they his Members.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore by a <hi>foederal Union</hi> with Jeſus Chriſt, that his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are made Partakers of regenerating Grace. That Union with him is to this End neceſſary, I have already ſhewed. All his Benefits are communicated to his People, as from a Head to its Members, and without ſome Union with him, none of his ſaving Benefits can be received by them. But it is evident, that in order to their receiving the Grace of Regeneration, they can have no other than a relative Union to him; and this can be no other than a foederal Union with him: And this, I ſay, they may and muſt have, before they can par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of regenerating Grace.</p>
                  <p>What I have here ſaid I ſhall endeavour to make good by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Conſiderations.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="76" facs="unknown:005439_0091_101831251a6848d0"/>1. There is a <hi>covenant</hi> as well as a <hi>vital Union</hi> betwixt Jeſus Chriſt and his People. That there is a vital Union betwixt him and them, is generally acknowledged among us. This I have ſpoken of before in Page 34. That there is alſo a Covenant-Union betwixt our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and his People, I ſuppoſe to be likewiſe acknowledged; and this is that of which I here ſpeak, and the Nature whereof I would explain.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Here then, in the firſt Place, I muſt obſerve, That there is a Covenant-Union betwixt God and ſome of the Children of Men, immediately ariſing, or reſulting, from a mutual Agreement or Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation betwixt him and them, which does not of it ſelf entitle thoſe who are taken into it, to any of the ſaving Benefits of the Covenant entred into. This will be manifeſt if the Nature of the Covenant intended (I mean the Covenant of Grace) be a little conſidered; and who the Parties are that are engaged in it.</p>
                  <p>And, in general, I here ſay, that the Covenant by which this Union is brought about, being conditional, the Union intended can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be effected, 'till the Condition be performed. The Covenant I here intend is the new Covenant, or the Covenant of Grace; and this is a conditional Covenant, as I have ſufficiently proved in the firſt Part of this Eſſay. In this Jeſus Chriſt and all his Benefits are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionally promiſed to ſinful Men. The Condition therein required of Sinners, is that they lay hold on the Covenant, or ſubmit to the Terms of it, and then perform what is required in it, in order to their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying the Good of it. What that is which is required, has already been ſufficiently declared. By doing this, Sinners obtain a Right to Jeſus Chriſt, with all his Benefits offered to them; and ſo have ſuch a Relation to him as they never had before. And in this Relation, whereof I now ſpeak, their covenant Union with him, which I here intend, does conſiſt.</p>
                  <p>But I ſhall endeavour to clear up this more fully by a brief Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſeveral Things here following, as (1) That there is a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Relation betwixt God and his People, which does immediately ariſe and reſult from their taking hold of the Covenant, or ſubmitting to the Terms of it. Tho' God does, in the Goſpel, offer to enter into Covenant with Sinners, this C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>enant is not actually made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt him and them, 'till there be a Conſent of both Parties to the Terms of it. This is done on th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>enant</hi>: In doing of which they are ſaid to <hi>join themſelves to the Lord to ſerve him,</hi> Iſai. 5 3, 4, 5. and <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.5. When this is done there is a mutual covenant En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:005439_0092_10183177e1e33390"/>
betwixt him and them, as in <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.17, 18. In the Language of the new Teſtament, this is done by a profeſſed Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Goſpel, and our being baptized in (or into) the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. Now, tho' hereby there is a covenant Relation and Union brought about or effected betwixt God and the Sinners thus taking hold of the Covenant, as is expreſſed in the Places quoted; yet this is not that Union with Jeſus Chriſt, which I principally here intend: For Perſons may be thus joined to the Lord, and yet never be ſaved, as appears, <hi>John</hi> 15.1,—6. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.3, 4. and ſeveral other Places. Wherefore (2) There is yet a nearer covenant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, or foederal Union betwixt Chriſt and his People, than that which has been now mentioned, which is come into when Men come up to the Terms, or perform the Condition, on which Chriſt and his Benefits are, in the Goſpel, offered to them. For whereas, 'till this is done, God's covenant People are but in a State of Probation, in order to their obtaining the everlaſting Mercies offered to them in the new Covenant, on a Condition yet depending, not being fulfilled; they having now performed that Condition, have a real and juſt Right to all that Good, of which before they had no more than a conditional Promiſe made to them.</p>
                  <p>Having thus declared what I intend, both by that vital and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Union, which is betwixt Chriſt and thoſe belonging to him, I ſhall proceed,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To ſhew how unreaſonable a Thing it is for any to imagine it poſſible, that a Perſon who has no ſuch covenant Intereſt in, or Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to, Jeſus Chriſt, as that but now deſcribed, may yet be vitally united to him, in the Manner before Expreſſed, (Page 74.) A Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon vitally united to Jeſus Chriſt, is made an actual Partaker of him, and Chriſt has taken Poſſeſſion of his Soul, to dwell and walk in for ever: They who are thus joined to the Lord are one Spirit with him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. and ſo in ſuch a Union as that mentioned by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, in John 17.21, 22, 23. <hi>That they may be one, as thou, Father, art in me and I in thee, that they may be one in us:— and the Glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them: that they may be one, even as we are one. I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one.</hi> And ſuch a Union as that alſo by him intended, Rev. 3.20. <hi>Behold I ſtand at the Door and knock, if any Man hear my Voice, and open the Door, I will come in to him, and will ſup with him, and he with me.</hi> — Is it poſſible that they ſhould enjoy Chriſt, in ſuch an Union with him? For my part, I am otherwiſe perſuaded.
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:005439_0093_10183128038cc870"/>
If Sinners may be thus made Partakers of Chriſt, before they have any covenant Intereſt in him, or Right to his Benefits, What Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is there of a conditional Offer of him to be made to them in the Goſpel? And how unaccountable is it, that any do affirm, That Sinners muſt be vitally united to Jeſus Chriſt, before they can have a covenant Right to him; yea, before they can perform the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on which he is offered in the Goſpel? I cannot think that ſuch an Union with Chriſt, in order to our having a covenant Intereſt in him and his Benefits, is neceſſary; but on the contrary, That our having a covenant Intereſt in him is neceſſary, in order to our having ſuch a vital Union with him: And that Sinners, who are eternally ſaved, do not perform the Condition on which Chriſt is offered, after they are thus united to him, but in order to their being ſo. Chriſt ſtands and knocks at the Sinner's Door, and the Sinner opens to him before he comes in to him, as appears by the Text lately mentioned, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. If it be ſaid, that no Man can poſſibly open his Heart to Chriſt, by any Aſſiſtances he can receive from him, until Chriſt be vitally united to him; as this is to beg the Thing in Queſtion, ſo it ſeems to contradict the Text, which ſuppoſeth the Sinner to open to Chriſt knocking at the Door of his Heart, before he enters, and takes up his Abode in it. Chriſt can knock loud enough to ſtir up the Sinner to open to him, before he actually enters and takes Poſſeſſion of his Soul.</p>
                  <p>There is one Thing more here neceſſary to be ſaid, before I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to another Argument; <hi>viz.</hi> That tho' a <hi>covenant</hi> Union to, or with Jeſus Chriſt, be only neceſſary, in order to a Sinner's partaking of the Grace of Regeneration, or indeed poſſible to be had; yet that Grace being once received, all future Supplies of more of the ſame Kind flow from him to his Members, as <hi>vitally</hi> united to him, and living Members of that myſtical Body, whereof he is the living Head. Hence it is that many Texts of Scripture, which ſpeak of thoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences and Supplies of Grace, which Chriſt's Members receive from him, do plainly ſuppoſe and imply their being in a State of vital Union with him, as <hi>John</hi> 1.16. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 1,—6. But ſuch Union cannot be neceſſary to the <hi>firſt Grace,</hi> but that is neceſſary to <hi>it,</hi> as being immediately effected by it.</p>
                  <p>I now proceed to a ſecond Argument, to prove, That no Act or Acts flowing from the Grace of Regeneration, or implied in it, can be the Condition on which Salvation is offered. And the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I ſhall now make uſe of is this, That if this might be,
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:005439_0094_1018317b9bcce9b0"/>
then may Sinners be made Partakers of the Grace of Regeneration, <hi>before</hi> they are juſtified by the Imputation of the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt to them, which it is impoſſible they ſhould be. Note here, that, by <hi>before,</hi> as formerly, I intend <hi>before,</hi> in order of Nature, and not in reſpect of Time. I acknowledge that in this Senſe, theſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are granted together, and at once; but if we reſpect the natural Order of their being given, Juſtification or Abſolution from the Guilt of Sin, goes before the other.</p>
                  <p>Before I proceed to make this good, I will, for preventing Miſtakes, take Notice of a neceſſary Diſtinction, with Reſpect to Man's Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication before God, or by him. That which I intend is this, That by our Juſtification we may underſtand, either our Juſtification by the Imputation of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to us, or our being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted and declared righteous, on the Account of our Intereſt in that Righteouſneſs, after the Imputation thereof. As theſe are Things evidently diſtinguiſhable, in reſpect of the Nature and Order of them; ſo they are no leſs plainly diſtinguiſhed in the holy Word of God. Juſtification, in Scripture, ſometimes ſignifies the making of a Man righteous, by the Imputation of the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt to him, or by the Gift of that Righteouſneſs conferred on him, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. And this agrees well with the Meaning of the Word; for, as to glorify ſignifies to make glorious, ſo to juſtify ſignifies to make juſt or righteous; and this is in Scripture uſed for a Sinner's being made juſt or righteous, by the Imputation of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to him, Rom. 4.5, 6. <hi>But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that juſtifieth the Ungodly, his Faith is counted to him for Righteouſneſs</hi>: Even as <hi>David</hi> alſo deſcribeth the Bleſſedneſs of the Man unto whom God imputeth Righteouſneſs without Works. Thus ſuch as are unjuſt and ungodly before, and until they are juſtified, are by their Juſtification made righteous, by a Righteouſneſs imputed to them, the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt being unto and upon them, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22.</p>
                  <p>But then, Juſtification is ſometimes in Scripture taken for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring and pronouncing one righteous, who really is ſo, before ſuch a Sentence is pronounced: And in this Senſe, to juſtify, is a forenſick Word or Term, taken from Courts of Juſtice, and is in that Senſe commonly uſed among Men. In this Senſe of the Word, Men never ſhould, and God never does juſtify any, but thoſe who are juſt before ſuch Juſtification. <hi>For he that juſtifieth the Wicked, and he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth the Juſt, even they both are an Abomination to the Lord,</hi> Prov. 17.15. Taking Juſtification in this Senſe, a Man muſt be juſt and
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:005439_0095_1018312b8122f460"/>
holy too, before God will juſtify him. And there is no Doubt to me, but that when the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> affirms, That a Man is juſtified by Works, he uſeth the Word in this Senſe: For thus God juſtifieth none but ſuch as have both an imputed and an inherent Righteouſneſs. But in the firſt Senſe mentioned, which is that in which I uſe the Word in this Diſcourſe, a Man has no true Righteouſneſs at all before God juſtifieth him, by the Imputation of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt to him: And thus, for God to juſtify the Ungodly, is a Word or Term peculiar to the Goſpel; and is never uſed in any Courts <hi>of</hi> Juſtice among Men, that I know of.</p>
                  <p>This being the Senſe in which I uſe the Word, as I intimated, what I here affirm is, That a Sinner is not, cannot be regenerated by the Spirit of God, or born of the Spirit, before he is juſtified; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently no Act flowing from the Grace of Regeneration, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying it, can be the Condition on which Salvation is offered, or given: And I will endeavour to make good both the Antecedent and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, or Inference from it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I ſay, That no Sinner is, or can be regenerated by the Spirit of God, before he is juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to him; or that Juſtification is, in Order of Nature, before Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not after it.</p>
                  <p>To make this good, I will ſhew, that it will not conſiſt with that perpetual or ſtanding Rule of Righteouſneſs, which God entred into with Mankind in <hi>Adam,</hi> while in Innocence, to regenerate ſinful Men by his holy Spirit, while they are in an unjuſtified Eſtate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And this I ſhall endeavour to clear up in ſeveral Obſervations, which here follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) The Covenant of Works which God entred into with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind while in Innocency, was deſigned to be a ſtanding Rule of rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Juſtice, betwixt himſelf and them, according to which he would deal with them for ever. This has been well obſerved and aſſerted by the learned and very judicious Mr. SAMUEL WILLARD, in his Expoſition of the Aſſemblies Catechiſm, (Page 150.) Hence all God's Tranſactions with Mankind have hitherto been, and ever will be ordered according to that ſtanding Rule. If therefore, there could not have been a Way found out wherein the Juſtice of God, and the Honour of his Law might have been vindicated, yea, every Tittle of that Law fulfilled, as in <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.17, 18. no Fleſh could have been ſaved. With this agreeth what we have in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.26, and <hi>v.</hi> 31. alſo <hi>Chap.</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="81" facs="unknown:005439_0096_1018317e41e77510"/>2. According to the Tenor of this now mentioned Covenant, a perfect Righteouſneſs was required in order to Man's having Life and Happineſs; and Death was threatned for the leaſt Offence againſt it, as appears in <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. and <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10, 12.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. By ſinning againſt God, Man forfeited and loſt that Life, which, in a Way of Obedience, he might have obtained, and became ſubject to Death: In which Death not only <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> themſelves, but all their Poſterity were involved, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. and Chap. 3.23. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The Death which by Sin Mankind brought upon themſelves, included in it, as one ſpecial Part or Branch of it, the Loſs of God's Image, and the Corruption and Depravation of Man's Nature, which we call <hi>habitual Corruption,</hi> or <hi>original Sin.</hi> This, I ſuppoſe, I have ſufficiently proved in Part I. Chap. I. of this Eſſay. Here let it be remarked, (1) That the Sin by which Mankind loſt their Right or Title to Life, or rather, by which they fell ſhort of a Right to it, was their eating the forbidden Fruit. By this Sin the Covenant of Works was wholly broken, and the Life promiſed, utterly loſt, and the Death threatned, fully merited. (2) Man's looſing and being deprived of God's Image, the before mentioned Depravation of his Nature, was no Part of this Sin, but a penal Effect and Conſequent of it, as I have ſhewed in the former Part of this Eſſay. Indeed this Corruption of Man's Nature, after his Fall, does very much conſiſt in it, as well as in his actual Tranſgreſſions; and the ſame may be ſaid concerning the Devils. But what I ſay here is, that the Depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or Corruption of Man's Nature was not the Sin by which he brake the Covenant of Works, but a Puniſhment of it.</p>
                  <p>Indeed Man, after his Fall, went on ſinning againſt the moral Law, conſidered as a Rule of Righteouſneſs; but the Covenant of Works, as a Covenant, he could not more effectually break than he had already done. Nor did God after Man's Fall, require Obedience of him, as the Condition of that Covenant which he had already bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the Good whereof he had already forfeited, but treated with him wholly on the Foot, and according to the Terms, of a new Covenant, which he had begun to reveal and make known to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. For had it not been for this, there would have been no Room left for any Treaty with Sinners, in order to their Obedience and Happineſs. All that could have remained would have been the full Execution of that Sentence of Death on Mankind, which they
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:005439_0097_1018312e5b4eefb0"/>
had already begun to feel the Effects of. Pleaſe to compare what I have now ſaid, with Part I. Chap. I. Page 22, 23.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. If a Man may be made Partaker of a Principle of ſpiritual Life, one Moment in Time, or Reaſon, before he has an Intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt and his meritorious Righteouſneſs, I ſee no Reaſon why he may not have this Life for ever, and that in its full Perfection, without ever having any Intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs at all. If we may begin to enjoy ſuch a Life, without firſt having any Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in Chriſt, why may we not enjoy the ſame Life forever, without having any Intereſt in him? And then, what great Need have we of him, who <hi>is the Head of the Body, the Church: Who is the Beginning, the Firſt-born from the Dead, that in all Things he might have the Pre-eminence,</hi> Col. 1.18.</p>
                  <p>Having now, as I think, ſufficiently ſhewn the Impoſſibility of any Perſon's being regenerated by the Spirit of God, 'till he is firſt (in order of Nature) juſtified by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs imputed to him; I muſt now proceed to make good the Conſequence which I drew from that Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That no Act flowing from the Grace given in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, or implying it, can be the Condition on which Salvation is offered: And this is ſo evident a Concluſion, from the Propoſition from whence I infer it, that it is ſcarce poſſible to be made more evident, by any Thing that can be ſaid to make it manifeſt. Is it not obvious to common Senſe and Reaſon, that the Performance of the Condition, on which any Benefit is offered, muſt go, at leaſt, in order of Nature, before the obtaining ſuch a Benefit? If then Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be, in order of Nature, before Regeneration, how ſhould any Act flowing from the Grace given in Regeneration, or implying it, be the Condition on which Juſtification and Salvation are offered to Sinners?</p>
                  <p>But when I have thus argued, I have been ſometimes told, That Juſtification and Regeneration are both together in Time, and that my Diſtinction of one of theſe being, in order of Nature, before the other, is too nice and critical. To which I anſwer, That there are Hundreds of other Caſes, wherein learned Men do not think ſuch a Diſtinction too nice; as when Sinners are told, that they muſt come to, and believe in Jeſus Chriſt, before they may expect to be juſtified; when yet, thoſe that tell them ſo do believe and teach, that a Sinner no ſooner lays hold on Chriſt by Faith, than he is freely juſtified. And in the very Caſe, on which I am here diſcourſing, the learned
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:005439_0098_10183180f7cb9d78"/>
Dr. OWEN, diſputing with Mr. BAXTER, ſays,
<q>
                        <hi>Abſolution in Heaven,</hi> (as I call it) is before our <hi>actual</hi> believing in <hi>order</hi> of <hi>Time,</hi> I have no where ſaid, but only in <hi>order</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi>; and <hi>that</hi> Mr. BAXTER hath not diſproved.</q>
By believing here, the Doctor underſtands, that Kind of Faith, of which none but the Regenerate are the Subjects. To the ſame Purpoſe, he ſays afterwards,
<q>I <hi>profeſs</hi> that we are abſolved, <hi>pardoned</hi> and <hi>juſtified,</hi> for Chriſt's Sake, and therefore Chriſt is <hi>reckoned</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> or <hi>made Righteouſneſs</hi> to <hi>us,</hi> in order of Nature, <hi>antecedently</hi> to all thoſe Things which for his Sake we do receive, and are made <hi>Partakers of</hi> with and by him, &amp;c.</q>
Theſe Quotations may be found in Dr. OWEN's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Mr. BAXTER, annexed to his Anſwer to BIDDLE, Page 27. and 43. Whereunto agreeth what is ſaid by the excellent Mr. BURROUGHS, in his Book of Goſpel Remiſſion, Page 25.
<q>God pardons a Sinner, not becauſe he is changed, but that he may be changed.</q>
He frequently aſſerts the ſame Thing in that Book of his, alledging for what he affirms, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Col.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.33, 34.</p>
                  <p>It is indeed a Truth, that if by Man's Salvation we only under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his Happineſs in his Communion with God, either in this Life, or in that which is to come; his Regeneration muſt then be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a Condition of, or Pre-requiſite unto, his Salvation, not as a covenant Condition, but as a Thing phyſically neceſſary in order to his Happineſs, as being that without which he can neither know Things ſpiritual, nor take any real Delight and Pleaſure in them. See 1 Cor. 2.14, 15. and Job 27.10. <hi>Will he Delight himſelf in the Almighty?</hi> Heaven it ſelf could not give Satisfaction to an unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and unholy Soul. As ſuch cannot with Pleaſure converſe with God and Things ſpiritual here, ſo neither could they in Heaven, could they get thither.</p>
                  <p>Men's Salvation does not therefore conſiſt only in the ſetting ſuch Objects before him, as are very delightful to true Saints, but alſo in preparing them to receive and entertain them with ſuch Pleaſure and Delight, as ſuch Objects ſhould be received and entertained with, and will be by the Godly.

                  <p>There is one Exception, unto which what has been aſſerted in this Chapter, may by ſome be tho't liable, <hi>viz.</hi> That if what I here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in aſſert were true, it would from thence follow, that our effectual Calling follows our Juſtification, contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. where, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Apoſtle, it goeth before it. But I deny the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. It will follow, indeed, from what I maintain, that the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious Grace of God, by which the Work of Regeneration is wro't in our Souls, is not in order before our Juſtification. If it were a Truth, that Man's effectual Calling does conſiſt in that Act of God's Power on their Souls, by which they are regenerated, or <hi>created anew in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works,</hi> then indeed, it would follow, that our being effectually called would, according to me, follow our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But I ſee no Reaſon to grant, that our effectual Calling conſiſts in that efficacious Grace which I have now mentioned. I take ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Calling to conſiſt in that Work of God, by his Word and Spirit, whereby Sinners are perſwaded and enabled to comply with the Terms of the new Covenant; and to accept of Jeſus Chriſt and all his Benefits, freely offered to them in the Goſpel; among which Benefits our Regeneration is one of the chief. Our Regeneration by the powerful Operation of God's holy Spirit, ought to be looked upon as an eminent Part of that Salvation, which, in our effectual Calling, we are perſwaded and enabled to go to God in Chriſt for, and ſo is, in order of Nature, before our going to Jeſus Chriſt, as we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; and before our Juſtification alſo, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. But this our Regeneration by the efficacious Grace of God, I take not to be ſo.</p>
                  <p>But if (may ſome ſay) our Regeneration be not compriſed in our effectual Calling, in the Text lately mentioned, where then ſhall our Regeneration be found in that golden Chain, in which the Method of Man's Salvation is by the Apoſtle expreſſed? What Link in that Chain may we underſtand to intend the glorious Work of our Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? Or is not this Work taken Notice of in it? To this I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, That it is by no Means to be allowed, that this was therein for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, or omitted by the inſpired Apoſtle. Nor do I think with <hi>Barclay,</hi> a learned and noted <hi>Quaker,</hi> that this is intended by our being juſtified. He abſurdly takes our Juſtification and Sanctification to be the ſame Thing: But I freely acknowledge that I do not at all
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:005439_0100_101831d5648f38f0"/>
doubt but that our Regeneration, and the progreſſive Work of our Sanctification, are compriſed in our being <hi>glorified.</hi> Nor is this an Opinion peculiar to me, as I can ſhew if there be Occaſion for it.</p>
                  <p>It is a great Truth in Divinity, That when God regenerateth any Perſon, he therein begins to glorify him; and in carrying on the Work of his Grace in regenerate Saints, he glorifieth them more and more. To this that well agreeth, 2 Cor. 3.18. <hi>But we all with open Face, beholding as in a Glaſs the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image, from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</hi> Every regenerate Soul hath eternal Life, <hi>i. e.</hi> he already hath it, and is <hi>paſſed from Death unto Life</hi>; and he hath it <hi>abiding in him,</hi> as in <hi>John</hi> 5.24. and 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.14, 15. Such have the very ſame Life in them which all glorified Saints ſhall live in Heaven for ever: For, as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines confeſs and maintain, Grace is Glory begun, and Glory is Grace made perfect. God has already given unto ſuch the <hi>Earneſt of their Inheritance,</hi> which is the ſame in Kind with what they ſhall hereafter receive in full. Herewith agreeth that, Eph. 1.11. <hi>In whom we have obtained an Inheritance, being predeſtinated according to the Purpoſe of him who worketh all Things after the Counſel of his own Will.</hi> That alſo in Verſe 13, 14. <hi>In whom ye alſo truſted after that ye heard the Word of Truth, the Goſpel of your Salvation: In whom alſo after ye believed, ye were ſealed with that holy Spirit of Promiſe, which is the Earneſt of our Inheritance, until the Redemption of the purchaſed Poſſeſſion, unto the Praiſe of his Glory.</hi> God has already <hi>called ſuch unto his eternal Glory,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.10. And the <hi>Spirit of God and of Glory reſteth on them,</hi> 1 Pet. 4.4.</p>
                  <p>I would here further obſerve with Reſpect to our effectual Calling, that the good Effects thereby wrought on us, tho' not of the ſame Kind with thoſe wrought in our Regeneration, yet they are the ſame with that Faith and Repentance which, according to my Hypotheſis, is the Condition of the new Covenant. And I alſo ſuppoſe, that Men's Perſeverance in the Exerciſe of ſuch Faith and Repentance, 'till they obtain the Benefits of Juſtification and Regeneration, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in their effectual Calling. None are effectually called without being perſuaded and enabled to hold out and go on to ſeek the Lord 'till he hath Mercy on them, and grants his ſaving Benefits to them.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VI. The Offer of Salvation made to Sinners in the Goſpel, is an Offer of bringing them into a State of Salvation; and conſequently muſt compriſe in it an Offer of regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Grace.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O clear up this Argument I need only ſay a few Things very briefly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By a State of Salvation I underſtand ſuch an Eſtate as that ſpoken of by our Saviour, John 5.24. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, He that heareth my Word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting Life, and ſhall not come into Condemnation; but is paſſed from Death unto Life.</hi> Such an Eſtate as this is alſo deſcribed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, Rom. 8.1. <hi>There is therefore no Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit.</hi> And Verſe 35. and onwards, <hi>Who ſhall ſeparate us from the Love of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To put Men into ſuch an Eſtate as this, is wholly the Work of the bleſſed God. It is, I ſay, the Work of God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt. (<hi>Matth.</hi> 28.10. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7.) God only performs this Work, and he only can promiſe to perform it. Never did any Man put himſelf into ſuch a State. Whatever may be required of Sinners in order hereunto, yet to put them into ſuch a State is wholly God's Work: Men themſelves have no Hand in it. God only ſaves all that are ſaved, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.11. If Men are ſaid to <hi>ſave themſelves,</hi> we muſt only underſtand by it, their doing ſomething required of them in order to God's ſaving them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When God offers to ſave Sinners, he therein offers to bring, or put them, into ſuch a State of Salvation as that but now deſcribed. When God offers to ſave Sinners, he therein offers to do all that for them, in which their Salvation conſiſts, <hi>i. e.</hi> all that he actually does
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:005439_0102_101831d72e8d86b8"/>
for them when he ſaves them. All this, I ſay, God offers to do for us, when he offers to ſave us; and to be ſure, out of this we muſt not, we may not, leave his beginning to ſave us, and bringing us into a State of Salvation. It is impoſſible for God to ſave Sinners, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing this for them, <hi>i. e.</hi> without tranſlating them out of a State of Death, into a State of Life.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. God, in thus bringing Sinners into a State of Salvation, does work in them the great Work of Regeneration, <hi>gives them a new Heart, and a new Spirit, creates them anew in Chriſt Jeſus, unto good Works.</hi> Therefore in offering to ſave them, he offers to do this for them, that is, he conditionally promiſeth that he will do it; which is the Point I am defending.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F one Perſon makes an Offer to another of any good Thing, which has many other good Things inſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably joined with or unto it, the Perſon to whom the Offer is made may well think, that he has an Offer of all thoſe good Things made to him, tho' they are not all enumerated in the Offer. No Man would, in ſuch a Caſe, imagine that he had only that one good Thing offered to him, or ſo many only as were expreſly mentioned, but would juſtly conclude that all thoſe other Goods which he was ſure were firmly bound up in the ſame Bundle with them, ſo as never to be ſeperated from them, were as really intended in the Offer, as thoſe expreſly named. Thus, if God offers any of his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial ſaving Mercies to ſinful Men, he offers every one of them; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:005439_0103_10183186083161b0"/>
he never gives any one of them to any Perſon unto whom he does not give them all.</p>
                  <p>That the ſpecial Mercies or ſpiritual Bleſſings which Jeſus Chriſt purchaſed for his People, are ſo inſeparably joined together, both in the Nature of the Thing, and by the Appointment of God, as never to be ſeparated one from another, is moſt evident. God never did, nor never will beſtow any one of them on any Soul, on whom he does not, at the ſame Time, beſtow them all. All that enjoy any of them may ſay, as in Eph. 1.3. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual Bleſſings in heavenly</hi> Places (or Things) <hi>in Chriſt.</hi> They are all of them <hi>Things that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company Salvation,</hi> yea, eſſentially belong thereto, as in <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.9. Therefore to whom God gives any of them, he gives them all; and to whom he offers to give any one or more of them, he offers to give them all.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes God, in a Promiſe mentions one of them, ſometimes another, but he always intends every one of them; and ſometimes he makes Uſe of Words which naturally compriſe every one of them; as when God offers Salvation to Sinners, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. this Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation compriſeth all ſpiritual Bleſſings in it: So when God offers to have Mercy on ſinful Men, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 55.9. this Mercy compriſeth not only Pardon of Sin, there expreſly mentioned, but all other ſpiritual Bleſſings, Grace and Glory and every good Thing needful, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.11.</p>
                  <p>That the Offer of Forgiveneſs of Sins, or of Juſtification, does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude in it an Offer of all other ſpiritual Bleſſings, is moſt manifeſt. In the Juſtification of a Sinner, the meritorious Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt is imputed or given to him: He therein <hi>receiveth the Gift of Righteouſneſs,</hi> Rom. 5.17. He receiveth Righteouſneſs from the God of his Salvation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.5. Now, whoever has an Intereſt in the perfect Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, has therein and thereby an Intereſt in, or Right unto, all thoſe good Things which, by that Righteouſneſs, he purchaſed for Sinners: And never had any Sinner any one of theſe Benefits in any other Way, than by firſt having an Intereſt in the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, by whom they were all pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for thoſe that believe in him. Nor had ever any Sinner an Intereſt in this Righteouſneſs in any other Way, than that of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, in whom it is, and in and with whom it is beſtowed, on all thoſe who, by Faith, receive him; and all ſuch may ſay, as in Iſai. 45.24. <hi>In the Lord have I Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:005439_0104_101831dca38affc0"/>
and Strength,</hi> &amp;c. Yea, unto all ſuch <hi>Chriſt is made Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. Thoſe that have him have a Righteouſneſs, and all Things obtained thereby with him. When God gives his own Son to them, <hi>he alſo with him freely gives them all Things,</hi> Rom. 8.32. He then gives them an Intereſt in his Righteouſneſs, and in all thoſe everlaſting Mercies purchaſed thereby.</p>
                  <p>And as it is a Truth, that if God offers a juſtifying Righteouſneſs to Sinners, he, in ſo doing, offers them all thoſe Benefits that were purchaſed by that Righteouſneſs; ſo it is no leſs true, that if God offers unto Sinners any of theſe Benefits that were obtained by Chriſt's Sufferings and Obedience, he therein offers them an Intereſt in that Righteouſneſs, by which the ſame were purchaſed for thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him. He offers not theſe without the Righteouſneſs that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured them; nor that Righteouſneſs without the Benefits procured by it.</p>
                  <p>Thus it appeareth, That whenever God offereth any of his ſpecial Mercies or ſpiritual Bleſſings unto ſinful Men, he offereth all of them: And it followeth from hence, that he muſt needs offer the Grace of Regeneration together with the reſt; nor is this excepted as implied in the Condition on which the reſt are offered, as has been before ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently manifeſted in Chap.

Promiſes in ſome of the following Chapters; I intend in <hi>this,</hi> to endeavour to ſhew, from the Teſtimony now alledged, that we may expect to find ſuch Promiſes in the Oracles of God, and have no Reaſon to think it ſtrange, if ſeveral ſuch be named and inſiſted on, for the Confirmation of the Hypotheſis which I am defending.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> Thing I ſhall obſerve in the Teſtimony read, is, that the <hi>Promiſes</hi> mentioned therein are ſaid to be <hi>exceeding great and precious.</hi> And ſuch may Promiſes be ſaid to be, in ſeveral Reſpects, as (1) In Reſpect of the Matter of them, or of the Nature of the Things en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in them. If the Things promiſed are great and precious, this puts a Value and Excellency upon the Promiſes wherein they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged. (2) The infallible Truth and Certainty of them is another Thing that greatly commends them, as precious and worthy to be prized, being ſuch as may be ſafely depended on.</p>
                  <p>I obſerve <hi>ſecondly,</hi> that the <hi>Promiſes</hi> are ſaid to be given by the ſame divine Power, by which, in Verſe 3. <hi>all Things pertaining both to Life and Godlineſs</hi> are alſo ſaid to be given to us: For unto this, the Word <hi>whereby,</hi> in the Beginning of the fourth Verſe, ſeems evidently to refer. And this is ſaid to be done by God and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, juſt before in Verſe ſecond. By <hi>all Things pertaining to Life and Godlineſs,</hi> in Verſe third, I do not underſtand Life and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it ſelf, but all Things requiſite to it, unto which theſe mentioned Promiſes belong; and ſo theſe Words are like thoſe in Iſai. 5.4. <hi>What could I have done more to my Vineyard than I have done in it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I obſerve <hi>thirdly,</hi> that theſe Pre-requiſites to Life and Godlineſs, are ſaid to be given us <hi>through the Knowledge of him that hath called us to Glory and Vertue</hi>: And this <hi>Him</hi> is Jeſus Chriſt, before mentioned; and it is by revealing and making him known that Sinners have <hi>all Things pertaining to Life and Godlineſs</hi> afforded to them. Nor is there Occaſion of underſtanding their being <hi>called to Glory and Virtue,</hi> of that which commonly underſtood by <hi>effectual Calling,</hi> i. e. ſaving Converſion; for all that enjoy the Grace of the Goſpel, as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. are <hi>called to Glory and Virtue.</hi> And by what follows in Verſe 4, thoſe here ſpoken to, (at leaſt ſome of them) were not yet <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the divine Nature.</hi> And tho' this Epiſtle was inſcribed to ſuch as had <hi>obtained like precious Faith</hi> with the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> and other true Saints, as appears in Verſe 1. yet there is no Occaſion to ſuppoſe, that all that are ſpoken to in it, had obtained <hi>the Faith of God's Elect</hi>; becauſe that Kind of Faith which ſome of the Non-Elect
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:005439_0106_101831e1913f8318"/>
and Unregenerate are the Subjects of, may be alſo called <hi>exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing precious,</hi> in Reſpect of the Object of it, the glorious Truth unto which it aſſenteth: And all that have received the Goſpel, by giving Credit to it, may be ſaid <hi>to have obtained like precious Faith</hi> in Reſpect of its Object, with thoſe who have obtained Faith of a much better Kind, in Reſpect of the Rectitude of its Acts; of which laſt Kind, no doubt many of thoſe here ſpoken to by the Apoſtle, had alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
                  <p>That thoſe ſpoken to are ſaid to have obtained the Faith mentioned <hi>thro' the Righteouſneſs of God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is a great Truth, whether the Faith intended be of one of the Kinds mentioned, or the other; for common Grace, as well as that which is ſaving, is an Effect of the Merits of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs. But if his Faithfulneſs in fulfilling his Promiſes may be intended by the Righteouſneſs here ſpoken of Verſe 1. as ſome ſuppoſe, this would ſeem to favour the Hypotheſis for which I plead.</p>
                  <p>That the Apoſtle, in Verſe 2d, wiſheth <hi>Peace from God the Father</hi> to thoſe unto whom he writeth, is far from neceſſarily ſuppoſing them to be already in a regenerate State.</p>
                  <p>I obſerve here <hi>fourthly,</hi> that the great <hi>End</hi> for which theſe precious Promiſes are ſaid to be given to thoſe that have them, is, <hi>that by them they might be Partakers of the divine Nature.</hi> By which <hi>divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> our Divines generally underſtand the ſame Thing which is by me called the Grace of Regeneration. And I may here well obſerve, that this being the End for which theſe Promiſes are given to thoſe unto whom the Apoſtle here ſpeaks, it from hence evidently appears, that they are not by the Apoſtle all ſuppoſed to be in a regenerate State, notwithſtanding any Thing ſaid in the firſt Verſe: That the Perſons thus ſpoken to, ſtill need the Grace of Regeneration is plain, and ſeems evidently ſuppoſed in the Expreſſions: So that all the Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, in what Senſe Sinners that are ſtill unconverted may, by the mentioned precious Promiſes, be made Partakers of the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture here ſpoken of?</p>
                  <p>I further obſerve <hi>fifthly,</hi> that the Time when thoſe here ſpoken to may by the mentioned Promiſes be made Partakers of the divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture intended, is when they have <hi>eſcaped the Corruption that is in the World thro' Luſt</hi>: For thus the Words run, <hi>Having eſcaped,</hi> &amp;c. Which eſcaping the Corruption that is in the World, is not effected by Regeneration, but by a Work, in the Nature of it, preparatory to it; and of which Perſons not ſavingly converted may be the Subjects,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:005439_0107_1018318c09c25250"/>
as evidently appears in Chap. 2. Verſe 20, 21, 22. of the ſame Epiſtle; where ſuch as had <hi>eſcaped the Pollutions of the World, thro' the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> are yet mentioned as finally miſcarrying. Now I am not here diſcourſing with ſuch as hold, that true Saints may fall from Grace. In the Words there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore under Conſideration, it is plainly intimated, that God will not ordinarily, at leaſt, make Perſons Partakers of the divine Nature 'till they have firſt reformed their Lives, in ſuch a Manner and Degree as Perſons may before they are born again. And this is plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated to us in other Texts of Scripture, as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.22, 23. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. as I ſhall afterwards more fully ſhew. Men have no Reaſon to expect, that God will pour out his Spirit upon them, to their ſaving Converſion, that will not repent and reform their Lives, in ſuch a Manner as by the Help of common Grace they may. This, I ſay, is neceſſary in order to Men's being <hi>made Partakers of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now I know of but two Ways in which it can, with any Shew of Truth, be ſuppoſed, that the precious Promiſes mentioned can ſerve unto this End. One of theſe, is, that they are Inſtruments in the Hand of God for the working this great Change, call'd Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſo of communicating unto Sinners the divine Nature ſpoken of. The other Senſe is, that God makes Sinners Partakers of this gracious Principle, in Purſuance of precious Promiſes, wherein he has conditionally engaged ſo to do. The former of theſe Ways ſome take and I miſlike. The latter of them is that to which I adhere, and for which I plead. I ſuppoſe, that thoſe who are for the firſt, may think there is Danger in admitting, that the divine Nature is given in Conſequence of any conditional Promiſes made of it. I think there is none. I will firſt briefly ſhew why I agree not with thoſe who expound theſe Words in the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe Ways; and then ſhew why I am for the <hi>latter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in the <hi>firſt</hi> Place, I will give ſome Reaſons why I think theſe Promiſes are not here conſidered as the Means or Inſtruments by which the Grace of Regeneration is wrought in Men's Souls. And (1) I ſuppoſe, that if the Deſign of the Holy Ghoſt had here been to declare what the inſtrumental Cauſes of Man's Converſion are, he would not have mentioned the Promiſes of God only, but would have aſcribed this to the Word of God in general, as he does in other Places, where it appears that this is his Deſign, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.7, 8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14,—17. and <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18. The Spirit of God in men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:005439_0108_101831e31c6fada8"/>
Promiſes only, gives us great Reaſon to think, that what he aſcribes to them, is ſomething proper to them, and not to the whole Word of God, which is inſtrumental in Men's Converſion, but to the Promiſes only, as giving a Right to the Good ſpoken of in the Place under Conſideration. (2) There is nothing either in the Text or Context, to oblige us to think, that that which I now argue againſt, muſt neceſſarily be intended in the Place; but on the contrary, that which I plead for ſeems to be the moſt natural and obvious Senſe of the Words, as I ſhall preſently ſhew, (3) That the Inſtrumentality of the Promiſes unto Men's Converſion, or to their being <hi>made Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the divine Nature,</hi> is not intended in the Words, I make evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by this Reaſon: The Promiſes neither are, nor can be, inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in the Senſe here in Queſtion, in making any Perſons <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the divine Nature.</hi> The Words muſt not be underſtood in a Senſe in which they neither are nor can be true.</p>
                  <p>But now, That no Man can by the Promiſes, be <hi>made a Partaker of the divine Nature,</hi> in the Senſe I oppoſe, I thus make manifeſt. Men's being <hi>made Partakers of the divine Nature,</hi> is the ſame Thing which, by <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> is otherwiſe called <hi>paſſive Converſion</hi>; or Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion taken in that Senſe as Divines underſtand it, when they ſay the Soul is <hi>paſſive</hi> in it; and affirm it to be wro't by an immediate Act of the holy Ghoſt <hi>creating us anew in Chriſt Jeſus to good Works,</hi> as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. and Chap. 1.19, 20. In Converſion thus taken, the Sinner does nothing, but God all, Jer. 31.18, 19. <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned—. After I was turned, I repented.</hi> In the Converſion of a Sinner, taken in this Senſe, there is a Principle of Grace, or a divine Nature, put into the Soul, in the doing of which the Sinner himſelf has no Hand. He has <hi>a new Heart given to him, and a new Spirit put within him,</hi> by God. He does not this for himſelf, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. nor is it poſſible that any Promiſes can be the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of working ſuch a Change in Men's Souls. The Change now under Conſideration is not wro't by a <hi>moral Inſtrument,</hi> but by a <hi>phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Cauſe,</hi> or a <hi>ſupernatural Power</hi>; not by <hi>moral Suaſion,</hi> but by the <hi>mighty Power of God.</hi> When Mankind firſt ſinned againſt God, they loſt all the Power they had to perform any Actions truly holy: Now when Sinners are <hi>made Partakers of the divine Nature,</hi> this Power is reſtored again in and unto them; which the Word read and preached is no Way competent to be an Inſtrument of; neither the Precepts, Promiſes, nor Threatnings of it can do this; nor can all of them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether work ſuch a Change, any more than an Argument or Syllogiſm can remove a Mountain. All that the Word can do, it does in a
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:005439_0109_1018318de86ead70"/>
moral Way, by Inſtructions, Convictions, and Perſuaſions. It does not give any Power to the Soul that it had not before, but excites and ſtirs Perſons up to make a good Improvement of the Powers they have.</p>
                  <p>'Tho' that Text, Jam. 1.18. <hi>Of his own Will begat he us by the Word of Truth,</hi> ſeems to look another Way; yet we muſt know, that Regeneration, or the new Birth, may be taken more largely, as it compriſeth Men's active Converſion in it, or as intending their paſſive Converſion only. In the former Senſe, Converſion is aſcribed to the Word of God read and preached; but in the latter Senſe it is not, neither indeed can be. The Miniſtry of the Word does ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily accompany Converſion, but never works the Change: It does much in the Work preparatory to it, and in exciting to the Acts and Exerciſe of Grace, when once given; but it does nothing towards the infuſing of the Principle. The preaching of the Word is not that by which we are created anew unto good Works: It is another Kind of Word that does this, even ſuch a Kind of Power as that, Gen. 1.3. <hi>God ſaid, Let there be Light, and there was Light,</hi> as appears by comparing that Place with 2 Cor. 4.6. <hi>God who hath commanded the Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs, hath ſhined into our Hearts, to give us the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God, in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> This God does by giving the divine Nature to us, as in the Text under Conſideration. Thus I have ſhewn why I think the divine Nature is not communicated by the Promiſes, as inſtrumental efficient Cauſes of it.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now proceed to ſhew poſitively, why I conceive, that by theſe Promiſes we are <hi>made Partakers of the divine Nature,</hi> as it is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to them, that God communicates the ſame unto us; or as it is by them we have a Right to it: And to confirm this, I ſay, (1) This ſeems to be the moſt natural and genuine Senſe of the Expreſſions uſed in the Text here inſiſted on. When Perſons are ſaid to <hi>be made Partakers</hi> of any Mercy, by Promiſe, who would once imagine, that this meant, that the Promiſe intended was the efficient Cauſe in the Communication, or Conveyance of the Good ſaid to be given by it? And not rather, that it was by Promiſe as that gave a Right to it. See Gal. 3.18. <hi>If the Inheritance be of the Law, it is no more of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; but God gave it to</hi> Abraham <hi>by Promiſe.</hi> (2) Another Reaſon of this is, becauſe it is certain, that there are a great many ſuch <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great and precious Promiſes</hi> given, for the End here intended, <hi>viz.</hi> That, by Virtue of them, the Perſons to whom they are given, <hi>might be Partakers of the divine Nature</hi>; the ſame being conditionally
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:005439_0110_101831e4ee2b03f8"/>
offered in them. If no ſuch conditional Promiſes could be found in Scripture, as theſe I ſpeak of, it would not then be eaſy to declare what Promiſes are intended in the Place under Conſideration, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their Inſtrumentality to Converſion were what is therein deſigned. But if there are many conditional Promiſes of Regeneration found in Scripture, then we have good Reaſon to ſuppoſe, that the Way in which Sinners are by theſe <hi>made Partakers of the divine Nature,</hi> is by entitling them to it, on their Fulfilment of the Condition on which it is offered.</p>
                  <p>Now, That there are many ſuch Promiſes, I will ſhew in the Sequel of this Diſcourſe, by inſtancing in divers of them; and ſo ſhall here ſuppoſe this to be a Truth.</p>
                  <p>But I ſuppoſe it will by ſome be here ſaid, That tho' it be denied, that there are any ſuch conditional Promiſes as I plead for; yet inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as there are abſolute Promiſes of the Grace of Regeneration, (by ſome called the firſt Grace) theſe may be the Promiſes intended in the Text inſiſted on; and in Conſequence of which the Grace of a new Heart may be given, without Men's Performance of any Condition, by which they may be entitled to the Good of theſe Promiſes: And <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19, 20. and Chap. 36.26. are commonly inſtanced in, as containing ſuch Promiſes. Unto this, ſeveral Things may be ſaid, as,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> It may be doubted whether theſe called <hi>abſolute Promiſes,</hi> are indeed any Promiſes at all. Some learned Men ſeem to think they are not; but rather Prophecies of the Mercies mentioned in them. I think Mr. BAXTER was of this Opinion. It ſeems eſſential to a Promiſe of good Things, that the Perſon or Perſons, to whom it is made, be ſome Way or other deſcribed or indigitated in it. Now, theſe, here called Promiſes, do not this. No one Perſon can truly affirm, that theſe Promiſes are made to him. If they be Promiſes <hi>Judas</hi> might have laid as good a Claim to them as <hi>Peter.</hi> If God converts a Sinner, he does not therein fulfil any ſuch Promiſe to him: If he does, then was he obliged by Promiſe to do it; which, how can any make manifeſt. If God ſhould not convert and ſave any Sinner in the World, none could ſay, that God has not kept his Word with him: Unleſs, with me, conditional Promiſes of converting Grace be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged. If there be any Thing at all of the Nature of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, in ſuch Declarations of God's Intention to convert and ſave ſome of the Children of Men, all Mankind have an equal Right to it, by Virtue of what is therein engaged, tho' God may, in his ſecret Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, intend the Good promiſed to certain definitive Perſons, and not to any other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="96" facs="unknown:005439_0111_101831931f2cf8e8"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> If theſe are allowed to be properly Promiſes; yet ſome think they are not Promiſes properly made to any of the ſinful Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men, but to Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, in the Covenant of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, agreed on betwixt his Father and him; of which we have an Account in the holy Scriptures, <hi>Pſal,</hi> 39.3. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.10, 11, 12. and elſewhere. Of this Judgment was our very judicious and learned Mr. WILLARD, as appears in his Treatiſe of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, Page 118. Thus theſe Promiſes are not made to Sinners at all, nor <hi>given to us,</hi> as in the Text under Conſideration.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If theſe be allowed to be Promiſes, and to be made to the ſinful Children of Men, I deſire to know how it appears, that there is no Condition required of them in order to their being Partakers of the Good promiſed.—The Contrary ſeems plainly to appear, with Reſpect to that in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. For tho' a Condition be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the ſame Verſe or Sentence; yet there ſeems to be one plainly required, a little after, in Verſe 37. <hi>Yet for this will I be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of by the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael <hi>to do it for them.</hi> By which Words, I think, all other Promiſes of the like Nature may be explained. God does, therein, as good as tell thoſe, unto whom ſuch Promiſes are made, that they may not expect this Mercy without ſeeking to him for it; and doubtleſs thoſe that expect it in any other Way will find themſelves miſtaken. What tho' God does not always expreſs the Condition of a Promiſe, in every Place where the Promiſe it ſelf, and the Good promiſed, is expreſſed; yet if, in other Places, the Condition be expreſſed, as well as the Good he promiſeth, this is ſufficient to let us know, that the Promiſe is every where to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as made on that Condition; at leaſt, that Men may not expect the Good of ſuch Promiſes, without the Performance of the Condition required in order to it. And I ſhall ſtill have Occaſion to ſhew, that there are many Places of Scripture where Promiſes of the ſame Mercy are conditionally propoſed to Sinners.</p>
                  <p>And ſuppoſe I ſhould find, in the Bible, ſeveral Places where Pardon of Sin is promiſed, without expreſly naming the Condition on which that Promiſe is made, might I from thence infer, that it is a Benefit that is not conditionally offered? If this would do, we may find ſuch Places, as in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 43.22. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.34. and Chap. 33.8. ſo in <hi>Micah</hi> 7.18. May we infer from hence, that Pardon of Sin is not conditionally offered? Surely I think not.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. IX. That the conditional Promiſes, made in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that ſuch as ſeek God and his ſpecial Favour, ſhall find him, do contain or imply in them, an Offer of the Grace of <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</hi>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> SHALL, for the clearing up of what is here aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, endeavour to ſhew, (1) That there are in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conditional Promiſes made, that ſuch as ſeek <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>ſpecial Favour,</hi> ſhall find <hi>him</hi> and <hi>that.</hi> (2) That theſe Promiſes contain and imply in them, an Offer of the Grace of Regeneration.</p>
                  <p>To make good the firſt of theſe, I ſhall (1) inſtance in ſeveral ſuch Promiſes as I here intend. (2) Make ſome Obſervations on them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Promiſes I here intend are ſuch as theſe which follow, 1 Chron. 28.9. —<hi>If thou ſeek him, he will be found of thee.</hi> 2 Chron. 15.2. —<hi>The Lord is with you while ye be with him; if ye ſeek him, he will be found of you; if ye forſake him, he will forſake you.</hi> Prov. 8.17. <hi>Thoſe that ſeek me early ſhall find me.</hi> Jer. 29.13. <hi>Ye ſhall ſeek me, and find me, when ye ſhall ſearch for me with all your Heart.</hi> Amos 5.4. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord unto the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>Seek ye me, and ye ſhall live.</hi> Matth. 7.7,—11. <hi>Aſk, and it ſhall be given to you: Seek, and ye ſhall find: Knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you. For every one that aſketh, receiveth: And he that ſeeketh, findeth: And to him that knocketh, it ſhall be opened. Or what Man is there of you, whom, if his Son aſk Bread, will give him a Stone? Or if he ask a Fiſh, will give him a Serpent? If ye then, being evil, know how to give good Gifts to your Children, how much more will your Father which is in Heaven, give good Things to them that ask him.</hi> We have the ſame Words, in effect, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.9,—13. With theſe Texts agreeth Iſai. 45.19.
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:005439_0113_101831962cdfe270"/>
                     <hi>I ſaid not unto the Houſe of</hi> Jacob, <hi>Seek ye me in vain.</hi> Alſo Iſai. 55.6. <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be found—.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. I ſhall make ſome Obſervations on the Promiſes. And here, I ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) Tho' the Words, in ſome of the Places mentioned, are not expreſs'd in the Form of Promiſes; yet Promiſes are plainly ſuppoſed or implied in them; as in that <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.19. and 55.6.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) Theſe Promiſes are <hi>conditional.</hi> A Condition is plainly expreſt in moſt of them, and implied in them all: And the Condition required is, <hi>ſeeking God</hi>: And is otherwiſe called, <hi>aſking, knocking,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) Such conditional Promiſes are made to unregenerate Perſons, to encourage them to ſeek the Lord for his ſpecial Mercies or ſpiritual Bleſſings. I do not ſay, they are not made to the Regenerate alſo, to encourage them to ſeek for more Grace; but I think the firſt and principal Deſign of them, is, to encourage ſuch as are in a State of Sin and Death, to ſeek to God for his ſaving Mercies; ſuch as Pardon of Sin, a new Heart, and a new Spirit. This is, at leaſt, one Deſign of them.</p>
                  <p n="4">(4) Thoſe Promiſes quoted out of the old Teſtament, as well as thoſe out of the New, are Promiſes of ſpiritual Bleſſings or everlaſting Mercies, and ought not to be underſtood of temporal Bleſſings only, ſee <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.17, 18.</p>
                  <p n="5">(5) When unregenerate Perſons are called upon and encouraged to ſeek God, with a Promiſe that they ſhall find him, and obtain Mercy from him, the ſeeking intended does not compriſe the exerciſing of true Grace and Holineſs in it: It is impoſſible it ſhould do this: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this is that, which they being without, are encouraged to ſeek after. God does not ſay unto an unregenerate Soul,
<q>Seek to me for the Grace of Regeneration, in the Exerciſe of that ſame Grace, and then I will beſtow it upon thee.</q>
It is a Diſhonour to God ſo to expound ſuch Promiſes. Therefore tho' it be true, as in the laſt foregoing Particular, that it is not any Kind of ſeeking that will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer this End, but a ſeeking after a due and ſuitable Manner, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſeeking with Faith, in Hope, under an humble Senſe of Unworthineſs, with great Earneſtneſs and Perſeverance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet this Grace to be exerciſed in ſeeking the Grace of a new Heart and a new Spirit, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſuch Faith, Hope and Humility, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as is peculiar to ſuch as are already born of God, and become new Creatures; but ſuch as may be called <hi>common Grace</hi>; inaſmuch as ſuch may have it, as are not yet <hi>paſſed from Death to Life</hi>; or as have not <hi>eternal Life abiding in them,</hi> as in <hi>John</hi> 5.24. compared with 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.14, 15. This
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:005439_0114_101831ec4d8c8950"/>
ſeems to be ſo evident, that I wonder that all Men do not yield to it, as I know of ſome that do.</p>
                  <p>Having now conſidered the Nature of the Promiſes alledged in this Chapter, for the Confirmation of my Hypotheſis, I ſhall proceed to ſhew, <hi>Secondly,</hi> That an Offer of the Grace of Regeneration is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in them. I have proved that they contain and compriſe condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Promiſes of our finding God, and obtaining his ſpecial Favour; and I muſt confeſs I am extremely miſtaken, if this does not include and imply in it our obtaining the regenerating and ſaving Influences of his holy Spirit. Does not our obtaining Mercy at God's Hands, as well imply in it his changing our Hearts, and endowing us with his holy Spirit, or making us Partakers of the divine Nature, as his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning our Sins, and juſtifying of us? Finding God, ſurely ſignifies, finding Favour in his Sight; and this certainly implies in it, our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving from him all thoſe ſpiritual Bleſſings which he beſtows on all thoſe to whom he extends his ſpecial Favour.</p>
               </div>
               <div n="10" type="chapter">
                  <head>CHAP. X. That thoſe conditional Promiſes of the Holy Spirit, which we have in the Oracles of God, include and imply in them Offers of converting Grace.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Promiſes which I here intend are ſuch as theſe following. Prov. 1.23. <hi>Turn you at my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof: Behold, I will pour out my Spirit unto you, I will make known my Words unto you.</hi> Luke 11.13. <hi>If ye, being evil, know how to give good Gifts unto your Children, how much more ſhall your heavenly Father give his Holy Spirit to them that ask him.</hi> Acts 2.38. <hi>Repent, and be baptized every one of you, in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the Remiſſion of Sins, and ye ſhall receive the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That theſe are Promiſes, and that they are conditional, ſeems too evident to be denied. A Precept with a Promiſe annexed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:005439_0115_1018319b14e194c0"/>
the Performance of the Duty required, muſt, I think, be looked upon as a conditional Promiſe. Such are theſe in each of the Places mentioned, as by the bare reading of them appears.</p>
                  <p>That theſe Promiſes are made to unregenerate Perſons cannot, I think, be reaſonably denied. That in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23. is made to ſuch Perſons as are deſcribed in Verſe 22. who are there thus called on, <hi>How long, ye ſimple Ones, will ye love Simplicity? And the Scorners de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſcorning.</hi> And it follows in Verſe 23. <hi>Turn ye,</hi> &amp;c. In <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. the Perſons ſpoken to are directed how they may obtain the Gift of God's Spirit, which ſuppoſeth that they are, or may be, without it; and thoſe who are ſo, may, I think, well take the Words as ſpoken to them, or concerning them. The Words in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. were ſpoken to very heinous Sinners, who were then cloſely dealt with, for having a Hand in the crucifying the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and who being <hi>pricked in the Heart,</hi> under a deep Senſe of their Sin and Guilt, aſked that Queſtion in Verſe 37. <hi>What ſhall we do?</hi> And the Anſwer given them did not import that they were in a State of Grace, but the contrary. They were, many of them at leaſt, in an unconverted State.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Things being briefly obſerved, I ſhall more diſtinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider two Things, <hi>viz.</hi> (1) What the Benefit is, here conditionally promiſed to theſe. (2) On what Condition it is promiſed.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us conſider what the Benefit is which, in the Places under Conſideration, is conditionally promiſed to ſuch Sinners as theſe: And, that we may judge aright of this, we ſhall conſider how the ſame is deſcribed in each of the mentioned Places.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall begin with that in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23. And here the Good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed is thus deſcribed; <hi>I will pour out my Spirit unto you.</hi> Whether by God's Spirit here, we are to underſtand the Perſon of the Holy Ghoſt, or thoſe Gifts and Graces of which he is the Author and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtower, need not be earneſtly diſputed. If the <hi>former,</hi> then the Spirit is here ſpoken of as poured on Men to work his ſaving Graces in them, which is as much as I deſire. If the <hi>ſecond,</hi> that is what I plead for in this Eſſay. If <hi>both,</hi> this ſtill comes fully up to my Purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Grace of Regeneration is conditionally offered or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to Sinners in the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                  <p>In which of theſe Ways ſoever this Promiſe is underſtood, ſaving Illumination and Inſtruction is certainly intended in the Promiſe
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:005439_0116_101831f14453a2b0"/>
made, when God tells thoſe that he ſpeaks to, that he will make known his Words to them. This will be evident by comparing theſe Words with others like them: Such as we may find in <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.5. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.18, 19. <hi>John</hi> 17.6, 7, 8. The pouring out of God's Spirit to ſinful Men, certainly intends ſaving Illumination and Converſion.</p>
                  <p>In that Place, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. the Thing promiſed, is <hi>the Gift of the Holy Spirit</hi> to thoſe that perform the Condition to that End required of them. Now by this Holy Spirit we muſt underſtand, either the Perſon of the Holy Ghoſt, whom God ſends into the Hearts of his choſen Ones, to regenerate, ſanctify and influence them, and dwell in them, as his Temple for ever, of which the Scriptures ſpeak plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully; or that Principle of ſaving Grace and Holineſs, which he works in, or beſtows upon, ſinful Men in their Regeneration; which is alſo called by the Name of the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> Gal. 5.17. and <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. and elſewhere: Either of theſe will ſerve my Turn.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. the Good conditionally promiſed to the Sinners there ſpoken to, is the <hi>Remiſſion of Sin,</hi> and <hi>the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt</hi>: In the laſt of which the Grace of Regeneration is certainly implied, as well as in the other Promiſes which I have already ſpoken to. Theſe are Things which God has, in the Promiſe, joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and no Man ought to go about to ſeparate them. What is intended by Salvation, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. and in this Chap. Verſe 22. is here called <hi>Remiſſion of Sin,</hi> is the ſame with that Believing, which is required in the but now mentioned Text in <hi>Mark.</hi> As for that extraordinary Effuſion of the Holy Ghoſt, ſpoken of in the former Part of this Chapter, there are many who repent and are baptized, who yet never obtain it. But the Spirit in its ſaving Operations, all who repent, and obtain Remiſſion of Sins do receive. And theſe Benefits true Penitents are made Partakers of in the order in which they are here mentioned, as I have already abundantly proved; <hi>firſt</hi> Pardon of Sin, and <hi>then</hi> the Grace of Regeneration immediately thereon.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We muſt conſider what the Condition is on which this Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is, or rather theſe Benefits are offered.</p>
                  <p>And,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) In Prov. 1.23. the Duty or Condition required is <hi>Turning at God's Reproof,</hi> by which we may not underſtand ſuch a Turning from Sin unto God as does pre-ſuppoſe the Gift of the Holy Spirit, in his
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:005439_0117_1018319fae4058e8"/>
regenerating Influences; for the Gift of the Holy Spirit, underſtood in this Senſe, evidently followeth the Turning here intended, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the Text; ſo that the Turning here required, is an Act on which the mentioned Benefit is promiſed.</p>
                  <p>We muſt know, therefore, that there is a <hi>Turning at God's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof,</hi> which is preparatory to Regeneration, and, in Order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, before God's <hi>pouring out his Spirit unto us, and making known his Words unto us,</hi> in that ſpecial Senſe, in which theſe Words are here uſed; and unto which the Influences of the Holy Spirit, with which ſome Sinners are favoured before they are ſavingly converted, are ſufficient. It is evident in Scripture, that Sinners enjoying the Miniſtry of God's Word, (here, as I think, called his Reproofs) accompanied with the Strivings of his Spirit, may have a Work of Converſion wrought in them, of a lower Kind than that which we call by the Name of <hi>Regeneration</hi>; and yet ſuch as to denominate them Believers, Penitents, Saints and Righteous; inſomuch that ſome who were never regenerated by the Spirit of God, are in Scripture ſaid to have <hi>eſcaped the Pollutions of the World, thro' the Knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> If what I have here ſaid be called in Queſtion, as I think it will not, I hope I ſhall be able, if I live, to make it good: At preſent I ſhall content my ſelf to refer my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſome of the Texts by which this Truth is ſufficiently confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Such as <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20, 21. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.41. and Chap. 11.21. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24, 26. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21. I may add, that Sinners not yet ſavingly converted may be ſo far turned as to cry earneſtly to God for converting Grace, as in <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.3, 4.</p>
                  <p>Thus much being ſaid, it is eaſy to conceive how Perſons not yet endowed with the Holy Spirit, in the Senſe that the Regenerate are, may yet be ſuch as aſk him, or pray to God to beſtow him on them, as in <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. The Condition there required in order to Perſon's having God's Spirit poured out to them.</p>
                  <p>In the other Text mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. the Condition required, is, <hi>repenting</hi> and being <hi>baptized in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> By the former of theſe we muſt underſtand ſuch a Kind of Repentance as I have already deſcribed in the laſt Paragraph, <hi>viz.</hi> a Kind of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance going before, and being, in the Nature of it, preparatory to Regeneration; becauſe, according to the Text, Men's having Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sin and the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, follows after it. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed when Sinners, being pricked in their Hearts, cry out, <hi>What
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:005439_0118_101831f2d3f3ae68"/>
ſhall we do,</hi> as in Verſe 37. and, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved,</hi> as in <hi>Acts</hi> 16.30. their Enquiry is not only after Pardon, but after a new Heart and a new Spirit alſo. Such are therefore fitly here told how they may obtain the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, as well as the Pardon of their Sins. Note, that by Repentance, here, the ſame Thing is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended as is meant by Believing, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16.</p>
                  <p>What is implied in Men's being <hi>baptized in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; and how this is required as a Condition of their receiving the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt, muſt be here briefly conſidered; for it ſeems plainly to be ſo required in the Words under Conſideration.</p>
                  <p>I then conceive that Baptiſm here, is not to be conſidered as a mere Waſhing with Water, in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, nor indeed ever ſhould be ſo, but as a Seal and Token of the new Covenant, as Circumciſion, according to the Nature of the Inſtitution, alſo was, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17, 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.11. So that to be circumciſed of old was, and to be baptized now is, the ſame Thing in other Words, as to be taken viſibly into Covenant with God. Reſpecting Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion it is plain that he that was circumciſed was thereby bound and obliged to the Obſervance of the whole Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. Where by the Law, I do not underſtand the Covenant of Works, but the Covenant of Grace, according to that Diſpenſation of it which, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the old Teſtament, was to be obſerved; for according to that Law the <hi>Jews</hi> were governed, and not according to the Tenor of the Covenant of Works; if they had, they could not have been ſaved. It is alſo evident, that he that is baptized in, or into, the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, is thereby bro't under an Obligation to perform all the Duties required in the Goſpel, or under the new Teſtament. And, by the Way, Infants are as capable of being brought under ſuch covenant Obligations now under the Goſpel, as they were under the Law. And as for the Adult, when they are baptized, they are bound by their own Act and Deed, to perform all the Duties required in the new Teſtament. And hence it ſeemeth to follow, that to be baptized in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, or in the Name of all the Perſons in the Holy Trinity, is the ſame Thing as to be initiated into the new covenant State, and laid under a foederal Obligation to perform all the Duties of it.</p>
                  <p>Now this being duly conſidered, we may the more eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand why, and in what Senſe Baptiſm is required, as a Condition of the new Covenant, or our Willingneſs to take upon us an Obligation to the Duties of it, or to take the Yoke of Jeſus Chriſt upon us:
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:005439_0119_101831a2ae33be58"/>
And he that refuſeth to be baptized, does in Effect therein ſay, That he <hi>will not have the Man,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>to reign over him,</hi> as in Luke 19.14. Such therefore, as refuſe to be baptized, are ſaid to <hi>reſiſt the Counſel of God againſt themſelves,</hi> Luke 7.30. 'Tis therefore no Wonder, that this is required as ordinarily neceſſary to Salvation, as in <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. and as neceſſary to our obtaining Remiſſion of Sin, and the Gift of the holy Ghoſt, here in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38.</p>
                  <p>Here, by the Way, I cannot forbear obſerving, how greatly they are miſtaken, who think that Baptiſm is, according to Chriſt's Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, to follow after Regeneration and the Remiſſion of Sins, when in truth it is to be received or ſubmitted to, in order to our obtaining theſe Mercies, as in the Text I am conſidering. Tho' the ſame Kind of Faith and Repentance be neceſſary in order to it, as I have ſhewed; yet not that which is peculiar to the Regenerate.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XI. That the Offers made to Sinners, of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Life, in the Goſpel, are Offers of the ſaving Graces of the holy Spirit.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT there are in the holy Scriptures moſt graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Offers of the Water of Life, is very certain. Such an Offer is that in Iſai. 55.1. <hi>Ho! every one that thirſteth, come ye to the Waters.</hi>— Such alſo is that in John 7.37. <hi>Jeſus ſtood and cried, ſaying, If any Man thirſt, let him come to me and drink.</hi> Such an Offer there alſo is in Rev. 22.17. <hi>The Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come. And let him that is athirſt come: And whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will, let him take the Water of Life freely.</hi> Such an Offer is alſo implied in John 4.10. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto her, If thou kneweſt the Gift of God, and who it is that ſaith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldeſt have aſked him, and he would have given thee living Water.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, all that is here neceſſary to my preſent Purpoſe, is to ſhew, that an Offer of the <hi>Water of Life,</hi> or of this <hi>living Water,</hi> does cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly contain or imply in it, an Offer of the Grace of Regeneration. And to make this evident, I ſhall (1) endeavour to prove, that the
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:005439_0120_101831f4f13b4198"/>
Grace of Regeneration, or a Principle of ſaving Grace and Holineſs, is the very Thing intended by the Water of Life, in Scripture: But if that may not be admitted, then (2) it muſt be implied and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in that which otherwiſe is intended by it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> I will endeavour to ſhew, that by the <hi>Water of Life,</hi> the Grace of Regeneration is in Scripture intended: And this I will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make evident, by comparing ſome of the Places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that ſpeak of it. In <hi>John</hi> 4.10. our Lord having ſpoken of this Water, in ſuch Language as plainly implieth an Offer of it, and his Readineſs to give it to ſuch as aſk it of him, he after ſome further Diſcourſe with the Woman of <hi>Samaria,</hi> gives her this further Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Advantages which ſuch have by it, as receive it of him. Verſe 14. <hi>Whoſoever drinketh of the Water that I ſhall give him, ſhall never thirſt: But the Water that I ſhall give him, ſhall be in him a Well of Water ſpringing up to everlaſting Life.</hi> In which Words of our Lord he plainly intimates, that this Water is ſomething, which the Perſons partaking of it, have within them, as a living Principle of Life and Motion; by which Principle of Life, what can we ſo well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand as that divine Nature given to Men in their Regeneration? Of which we read <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.14. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. Or, if not this, the Spirit himſelf, who is the Author, Beſtower and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of this divine Principle? Which of theſe is to me equal, and comes to the ſame Thing.</p>
                  <p>Again, our Saviour, in <hi>John</hi> 7.37. having invited thirſty Sinners to come to him, and drink, (of the Water of Life, no doubt) he adds in Verſe 38. <hi>He that believeth on me, as the Scripture hath ſaid, out of his Belly ſhall flow Rivers of living Water</hi>: By which Water, that we might underſtand what he intended, the Evangeliſt immediately ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins theſe Words, in Verſe 39. <hi>This he ſpake of the Spirit, which they that believe on him ſhould receive.</hi> Now, what can this poſſibly intend, if by it be not meant either the Perſon of the Holy Spirit, or that divine Principle which he is the Author of, in Men's Souls, as before.</p>
                  <p>The Belly, out of which theſe Waters are ſaid to flow, may be underſtood to mean the inward Parts, or Heart, as by comparing <hi>Job</hi> 15.35. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.6. does appear: And what we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by this Waters flowing from thence, we may gather from Luke 6.45. <hi>A good Man out of the good Treaſure of his Heart, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth that which is good</hi>; with which agreeth that in Pſal. 40.8. <hi>I delight to do thy Will, O God: Yea, thy Law is within my Heart.</hi>
                     <pb n="106" facs="unknown:005439_0121_101831a5050d6178"/>
The Scriptures of the old Teſtament, to which theſe Words of our Saviour, may, I think, be ſuppoſed to refer, may be ſuch as we have in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.3, 4, 5. and Chap. 49.10. and 58.11. the laſt of which Texts I ſhall only here tranſcribe, as agreeing well with this Place and that before mentioned, John 4.14. <hi>The Lord ſhall guide thee continually, and ſatisfy thy Soul in Drought, and make fat thy Bones: And thou ſhalt be like a watered Garden, and like a Spring of Water, whoſe Waters fail not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is one Exception to which, what I here plead for, may ſeem liable, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Evangeliſt ſays, that our Lord here ſpake of the Spirit, which they that believe on him ſhould receive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the Holy Ghoſt was not yet given, becauſe Jeſus was not yet glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: By which it ſeems as if our Lord here intended thoſe extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Gifts of the Holy Spirit given at <hi>Pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                           <desc>•••</desc>
                        </gap>coſt,</hi> after his Aſcenſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. beginning, according to that Prophecy in <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28, 29.</p>
                  <p>Now to this I anſwer, That tho' there be no Doubt but that our Lord had a Reſpect to the mentioned extraordinary Gifts; yet to reſtrain his Meaning to theſe only, without taking into what he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, the giving of the Holy Ghoſt, for the Converſion of great Numbers of Souls about that Time, is, I think, altogether without Warrant. I know of no Expoſitors that ſo reſtrain the Senſe of that Prophecy in <hi>Joel,</hi> to thoſe extraordinary Gifts of the Spirit men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, or to any other in the Days of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, or at any other Time afterwards, as not to include thoſe that are common to all Believers: And our Saviour warrants our expounding it in this Manner, by ſpeaking of his giving the Spirit, as the Privilege of Believers in general, without any Exception, in the Place diſcourſed on, and elſewhere, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. and <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38, 39.</p>
                  <p>If it be ſaid, that none can believe in Chriſt, 'till the Spirit of God in his ſaving Influences be given to them; And therefore, the Grace given in Men's firſt Converſion cannot be given to them by Promiſe; I ſhall, beſides what has been already ſaid to this, hereafter take this Objection under Conſideration.</p>
                  <p>If what I have now ſaid be not thought ſufficient to prove the Water of Life offered to Sinners, to be the ſame Thing with the Holy Spirit given in Regeneration, as I think it is, then I here fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That ſuppoſing Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, as ſome think, be intended by that admirable Water, the Gift of this Water will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and imply, the Gift of the Grace of Regeneration; and ſo an
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:005439_0122_101831f9d1ab6060"/>
Offer of Jeſus Chriſt will imply an Offer of that. As Jeſus Chriſt is ſometimes called <hi>the Bread of Life</hi>; ſo if it be allowed that he is here called the Water of Life alſo, an Offer of the Grace of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be ſtill implied in an Offer of Him. Thoſe who come unto him are ſaid to come as to a <hi>living Fountain,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.4. And he may be underſtood to be intended by that <hi>Fountain opened,</hi> Zach. 13.1. If it then be ſuppoſed, that Jeſus Chriſt himſelf is the Water of Life here intended, the offering of this Water to Sinners, is an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him to them. But then Jeſus Chriſt thus offered unto ſinful Men, is offered with all his Fulneſs to them, even all that Fulneſs of which we read <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18, 19. and <hi>John</hi> 1.14, 16. and if ſo, then to be ſure not without his Spirit and Grace in and with him <note n="*" place="bottom">See Part II. Chap. IV.</note>, which is the Point for which I, in this Eſſay, am obliged earneſtly to contend.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XII. Thoſe conditional Offers of ſpiritual Wiſdom made to Sinners in the Word of God, are Offers of a Principle of ſaving Grace or Holineſs.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N Purſuance of what I deſign in this Chapter, I muſt ſhew, that there are ſuch Promiſes as I here ſpeak of; and then prove, that theſe Promiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain or imply in them a conditional Offer of a Principle of ſaving Grace or Holineſs. And I ſhall endeavour to make this good in both the Parts of it, with Reſpect to two Promiſes, or rather one and the ſame, expreſſed in two Texts of Scripture; one of which we have in the <hi>old Teſtament,</hi> the other in the <hi>new.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſhall begin with that in the old Teſtament, which we have in <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. beginning. That we may at once ſee it with the Condition on which it is made, with a Reaſon given for the certain Fulfilment of it, I ſhall tranſcribe the Words from the firſt to the ſixth Verſe,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:005439_0123_101831aa0ca64be8"/>
                     <hi>My Son, if thou wilt receive my Words, and hide my Commandments with thee; ſo that thou incline thine Ear unto Wiſdom, and apply thine Heart to Underſtanding: Yea, if thou crieſt after Knowledge, and lifteſt up thy Voice for Underſtanding: If thou ſeekeſt her as Silver, and ſearcheſt for her, as for hid Treaſures: Then ſhalt thou underſtand the Fear of the Lord; and find the Knowledge of God. For the Lord giveth Wiſdom: Out of his Mouth cometh Knowledge and Underſtanding.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It cannot be denied that theſe Words run in the Form of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Promiſe: My Son, if thou wilt do thus and thus, then ſhalt thou, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in order to our rightly underſtanding the Text, we muſt conſider, (1) to whom this Promiſe is made, (2) on what Conditions, (3) what is the Good promiſed, (4) the Reaſon given for the Confirmation of the Truth of the Promiſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us conſider to whom this Promiſe is made. And here I ſhall only inſiſt on one Thing, <hi>viz.</hi> That this Promiſe is undoubtedly made to Perſons in an unregenerate State, as well as unto ſuch as are regenerate or born again. It is evident that it is the Scope and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Place, to direct Perſons how they may get true Wiſdom, that which is of the beſt Kind: And indeed this is the Scope of the whole Book of <hi>Proverbs,</hi> as appears Chap. 1. Verſe 2,—7. Now, to imagine, that ſuch Directions are, by the wiſe Man, and by God himſelf ſpeaking by him, given only to thoſe who are already truly and ſpiritually wiſe, is what there is not the leaſt Colour for. I deny not that the truly wiſe are here directed how they may get more Wiſdom of the ſame Kind; but I affirm, that this cannot be the only, or indeed the principal, Intendment of the Place: But ſuch as are ſtill deſtitute of the Wiſdom intended, are here directed how they may obtain it; and are encouraged to ſeek after it. Nor is that Compellation, <hi>My Son,</hi> any Way inconſiſtent with what I here ſay, if we conſider how it is frequently uſed in this Book, and elſewhere in Scripture.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We may conſider on what Condition this Promiſe is made. And there are here ſeveral Things required of the Perſons to whom it is conditionally propos'd. And here, before I inſtance in the Things required, I muſt obſerve in general with Reſpect to them, that none of them have, nor in Reaſon can have, any Thing in them that does imply, that the Perſons to perform them muſt, in order to it, be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with true ſpiritual Wiſdom, ſuch as they are directed and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to ſeek after; or that they are ſuch as cannot be performed
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:005439_0124_101831fe11c116f8"/>
'till the ſame Kind of Wiſdom be firſt obtained. The Reaſon of this is obvious. Every Thing here required, is required of ſuch as have not the Kind of Wiſdom intended, and this in order to their getting of it. Now, what can be more abſurd than to imagine, that the wiſe and inſpired <hi>Solomon</hi> did, in the Name of God, adviſe Perſons deſtitute of a certain Sort or Kind of Wiſdom, to labour to obtain the ſame, by performing certain Conditions, to the Performing of which their firſt having the ſame Kind of Wiſdom was abſolutely neceſſary? This would be no leſs unreaſonable, than to adviſe a blind Man to make Uſe of good Eye-ſight in ſearching after Medicines to cure him of his Blindneſs. The Thing therefore required of unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Perſons, in order to their obtaining the Wiſdom here intended, cannot be ſuch as cannot be done 'till they are firſt endowed with that Kind of Wiſdom which they are called upon to ſeek for: Nor will they appear to be ſuch on a due Conſideration of them. I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them ſeverally.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Thing required is the receiving of the Words of him who ſpeaketh them. <hi>If thou wilt receive my Words,</hi> i. e. the Words of <hi>Solomon,</hi> or any other true Miniſter's ſpeaking in God's Name: Or if we ſay the Word of God himſelf, it is the ſame Thing. This does not neceſſarily intend a receiving the Word of God in ſuch a Manner as none but the regenerate receive it. It may be ſuch a receiving of it as that intended, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20, 21. Nay, I ſay, it muſt be ſuch a receiving the Word as this; for this receiving it, as it reſpects many of thoſe who are ſpoken to, is only in order to their obtaining ſaving Wiſdom, they being ſtill without it.</p>
                  <p>The next Thing required as the Condition of ſuch Perſons ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining true Wiſdom, is their <hi>hiding God's Commandments with them</hi>; and this may be done by Perſons not yet regenerate, as by ſome awakened Sinner made ſenſible of his Sin and Guilt, and deſirous to know what he ſhall do to be ſaved. Is it not poſſible for ſuch an one to hear the Word of God with ſome Concern of Soul: Yea, to buy a Bible, and keep it by him, for his Inſtruction in the Way of Life; and frequently meditate on what he reads, and mark ſuch Places in it as he thinks beſt ſuits his Caſe, committing others to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, with a Deſign not to forget them, but obſerve and practice them? Or may we tell any one that does ſo, that he is in a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate State?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="110" facs="unknown:005439_0125_101831ad349f2d18"/>The next Thing required of ſuch is, that they <hi>incline their Ears to Wiſdom, and apply their Hearts to Underſtanding,</hi> i. e. give themſelves to the Study of them, with ſome Affection and Delight. So Mr. POOL on the Place. But then, I ſay, this Affection and Delight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, in order to their getting ſpiritual Wiſdom, muſt be ſuch as that mentioned in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20. becauſe the Perſons here ſpoken to, as thoſe there mentioned, have no Root of ſaving Grace in them, as was before declared. To <hi>apply the Heart to Wiſdom,</hi> may be as well underſtood of the Application of the Mind and Soul to the Study and Purſuit of it, as to the actual Acquiſition, or Exerciſe of it.</p>
                  <p>It is further required, in order to ſuch Perſons obtaining of Wiſdom, that they <hi>cry after Knowledge, and lift up their Voice for Underſtanding</hi>: That is, that they pray earneſtly to God for it, as in <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. Now is it not poſſible for any unregenerate Perſon thus to do? If it be not, many others beſides my ſelf, are miſtaken with Reſpect to <hi>Ephraim,</hi> when he prays, <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned,</hi> Jer. 31.18. We frequently exhort and preſs unregenerate Sinners to pray for the Grace of Regeneration, and conſequently for ſpiritual Wiſdom, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in the Fear of the Lord, <hi>Job</hi> 28.28. Now I would know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ought withal to tell them, that it is impoſſible that they ſhould do thus 'till after they have the Wiſdom which, being without, we adviſe them to ſeek after. That it is not in their Power to change their own Hearts, I readily acknowledge; but that they are unable with God's Aſſiſtance to Pray to him to do this for them, and this with great Earneſtneſs, I ſee no Reaſon at preſent to grant.</p>
                  <p>Another Duty or Condition required of unregenerate Sinners, in order to their getting this ſpiritual Wiſdom, is their <hi>ſeeking it as Silver, and ſearching for it as for hid Treaſures</hi>: By which I think we may well underſtand, their induſtriouſly attending all proper Means in order to their obtaining of it. Now I would know whether it be impoſſible for any unregenerate Perſon, under the deepeſt Conviction of Sin, Righteouſneſs, and Judgment, that ſuch are capable of, to do this? Is it abſolutely impoſſible for People, 'till after they are ſavingly converted, and become wiſe to Salvation, and ſo paſſed from Death to Life, to <hi>ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate,</hi> (as they are exhorted to do, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.24.) or to <hi>preſs into</hi> (or towards) <hi>the Kingdom of God,</hi> (as in <hi>Luke</hi> 16.16.) 'till after they are actually <hi>in</hi> it? And do not Men begin to <hi>work out their own Salvation,</hi> 'till after they are <hi>in</hi> a State of Salvation, and have actually obtained eternal Life? I cannot think our doing thus is the Work only of one Moment; but includes in it
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:005439_0126_1018320051a17550"/>
our <hi>watching at Wiſdom's Gates, and waiting at the Poſts of her Doors,</hi> (Prov. 8.34.) in order to our being made wiſe to Salvation, and not only after we are ſo: And it may be compared with the poor Cripples waiting at the Pool of <hi>Betheſda, John</hi> 5.2, 3. Can we truely affirm, that unregenerate Sinners neither can, nor ever do, thus wait on God in the Uſe of Means for the converting Influences of his Spirit? Or for the Beſtowment of true ſpiritual Wiſdom on them? Yea, let me aſk whether there have never been any unconverted Sinners that would rather have parted with all the Subſtance of their Houſes, than fail of true Converſion, and ſo of eternal Happineſs? Yea, I would yet farther enquire, whether it is impoſſible for any unconverted Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to do otherwiſe than that young Man did, who would not part with his outward Eſtate, tho' his Soul lay at Stake? <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.22. For my part, I doubt not but that an unregenerate Sinner may reſiſt unto Blood fighting againſt Sin. Compare <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.12. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.3. Men's doing all that I have ſpoken of, will not prove them to be already wiſe to Salvation: And yet I do not believe that any that perſevere in ſuch a Courſe as this, ſhall fail of the Grace of God, and finally periſh.</p>
                  <p>Now this brings me to the Promiſe made in the Place under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, to thoſe that perform the Conditions thus required: And this we have in Verſe 5. <hi>Then ſhalt thou underſtand the Fear of the Lord; and find the Knowledge of God.</hi> The Promiſe is very expreſs and peremptory; and I believe there are ſcarce any but what believe, that all who obtain the Good here promiſed, are made wiſe to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; not only brought nigh to the Kingdom of God, but actually into it. Thoſe who think that ſuch Seekers are ſo, who are deſcribed in the foregoing Verſes, will doubtleſs acknowledge, that they muſt needs be ſo, unto whom the Promiſe made in Verſe 5 is fulfilled. Whe Words of the Promiſe here made, do certainly ſignify the ſaving Illumination and Inſtruction of thoſe happy Souls that partake of the Good expreſſed in it. None can doubt of this that will be at the Trouble to compare this Promiſe with what we have in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.14. and 51.6. and 19.18, 19. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.27. <hi>John</hi> 17.8. <hi>Prov.</hi> 3.13. and Chap. 2.10, 11. Such as are wiſe to Salvation know the Wiſdom here intended to be that mentioned <hi>Job.</hi> 28.28. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.10.</p>
                  <p>We have in the Place under Conſideration a Reaſon given to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm to us the Truth of the Promiſe made, Verſe 6. <hi>For the Lord giveth Wiſdom: Out of his Mouth cometh Knowledge and Underſtanding,</hi>
                     <pb n="112" facs="unknown:005439_0127_101831af2fc88b40"/>
i. e. he that thus promiſeth to beſtow ſpiritual Wiſdom on ſuch as come up to the Terms on which it is offered, is the Lord Jehovah, who is the only and all-ſufficient Giver of that Wiſdom, by which Men are made <hi>wiſe to Salvation</hi>; he being the <hi>Father of Lights, from whom every good and perfect Gift cometh down,</hi> Jam. 1.17. Therefore we may aſſuredly depend on him for the Good thus promiſed, if we take the Courſe which he directeth us to for the obtaining of it.</p>
                  <p>I may now proceed to the other Teſtimony I intended, for the Confirmation of what I have aſſerted; and that is in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Jam. 1.5. <hi>If any of you lack Wiſdom, let him aſk it of God, that giveth to all Men liberally, and upbraideth not, and it ſhall be given to him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Text is very much like that laſt produced and vindicated; and therefore I ſhall need ſay the leſs upon it. The firſt Thing that I ſhall ſay on it is, that the Thing promiſed in it is <hi>Wiſdom</hi>; and this doubtleſs the ſame Kind of Wiſdom as that deſcribed by the ſame Apoſtle, Chap. 3. Verſe 17. <hi>The Wiſdom that is from above, is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, and eaſy to be entreated, full of Mercy, and good Fruits, without Partiality and without Hypocriſy.</hi> By which Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom the Apoſtle doubtleſs intendeth that which is truly ſpiritual and ſaving; and this not only Wiſdom neceſſary in ſome particular Caſe, as when Perſons are under Affliction and Tribulation, as in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Verſes, but alſo in every other Caſe; ſuch as is intended <hi>Job</hi> 28.28. and <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.10.</p>
                  <p>The Perſons to whom this Promiſe is made are any that lack Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as in the Text, <hi>If any of you lack Wiſdom</hi>—. For tho' this Epiſtle was more immediately written to thoſe mentioned in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it, Chap. 1. Verſe 1. yet it was no Doubt intended for the Inſtruction and ſpiritual Good of all that read it? For thus the Spirit of God ſpeaking in the Scripture, is to be underſtood, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.29. <hi>Mark</hi> 13.37. And who is there that <hi>lacketh</hi> this Kind of Wiſdom more than thoſe do, that have none of it; which is the Caſe of all unregenerate Perſons. But if it ſhould be here ſaid, that by ſuch as lack this Wiſdom, we may underſtand ſuch as are ſenſible of their Need of it; to this I anſwer, That tho' I cannot believe that the Direction here is given only to ſuch, inaſmuch as it may encourage thoſe that are not yet duly ſenſible how much they need it, to endeavour to become ſo; yet ſuppoſing this to be true, there is no Reaſon to queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that Perſons ſtill in an unregenerate State may be ſenſible that they need ſpiritual Wiſdom. Thoſe that are ſenſible that they need
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:005439_0128_10183201f84f0230"/>
Happineſs: And I believe it is poſſible, that an unregenerate Perſon may be convinced that it is impoſſible that he ſhould be made truly happy and bleſſed, without being made ſpiritually wiſe. I know that natural Men are apt to place their Happineſs in ſenſual Objects; but is it not poſſible for them to be convinced of their Error and Miſtake in this, 'till after they are ſavingly converted? I incline to tell People who are convinced of this, that it belongs to the Work ordinarily required as <hi>preparatory</hi> to Converſion, rather than as an eſſential Ingredient in it: For how ſhould any ſincerely turn to God, 'till firſt convinced of the Vanity of the Creature? If an awaken'd Sinner tells me, he is convinced that Nothing in any Creature, or in all of them together, can make him truly happy, I cannot, on this Account, tho' I believe him, aſſure him that he is in a converted State.</p>
                  <p>The next Thing to be conſidered is, the Condition required in order to the obtaining the Wiſdom intended; and this is, that they <hi>aſk it of God, who giveth liberally, and upbraideth not.</hi> Here obſerve, (1) That ſuch as need this Wiſdom are required to aſk for it. (2) They are required, in aſking it, to apply to a right Object, <hi>viz.</hi> God. (3) Here is ſomething to encourage them to do ſo, <hi>viz. He giveth liberally, and upbraideth not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">(1) If Sinners need ſpiritual Wiſdom, they muſt aſk for it. The Way of obtaining it is not to acquire it by hard Study, but by Prayer. There is a Sort of Wiſdom that may be acquired by Study and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, as other acquired Gifts and Qualifications are; but this is not of that Kind, nor obtained in that Way, (tho' neceſſary in the Work preparatory to it) but by fervent Prayer, called in Scripture <hi>aſking, ſeeking, knocking,</hi> Matth. 7.7, 8. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.9, 10.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) Thoſe that deſire this Wiſdom muſt ſeek it of a right Object, who is able and willing to beſtow it, <hi>viz.</hi> God. So in the Text, <hi>Let him aſk it of God.</hi> The moſt learned Men in the World cannot give this Wiſdom, by the beſt Inſtructions they can afford: Only God can do this, as we ſaw before. Prov. 2.6. <hi>The Lord giveth Wiſdom: Out of his Mouth cometh Knowledge and Underſtanding.</hi> And this Knowledge cometh out of God's Mouth, not only by Means of the Scriptures which he has given by the Inſpiration of his Spirit; but as the Light did which he gave in the Creation of the World, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.3. with which we may compare, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. And I may add,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:005439_0129_101831b2c8cc03a0"/>
that when we aſk this Wiſdom, we muſt aſk it in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, as we muſt all other Mercies.</p>
                  <p n="3">(3) Here is Ground of Encouragement thus to aſk this Wiſdom of God, <hi>viz. He giveth liberally, and upbraideth not</hi>: He giveth to all that aſk for it as they ought to do. He giveth not as Perſons of nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Souls are wont to give their Gifts; nor does he twit and upbraid thoſe who in their Straits ſeek his Favours: And this, if there had been no more ſaid, gives great Encouragement to aſk ſpiritual Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of him.</p>
                  <p>But as if this was not enough, there is in the Words a poſitive Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that thoſe who aſk it in the Manner required, ſhall obtain it: <hi>It ſhall be given him</hi>; exactly anſwering to what we had before in Prov. 2.5. <hi>Then ſhalt thou underſtand the Fear of the Lord; and find the Knowledge of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I expect that, againſt what I plead for the Support of my Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis from this Text, what follows in the two next Verſes will be objected, <hi>viz. But let him aſk in Faith, nothing wavering: For he that wavereth is like a Wave of the Sea, driven with the Wind, and toſſed. For let not that Man think that he ſhall receive any Thing of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If theſe Words be objected againſt what I hold and plead for, I ſuppoſe the Strength of the Objection (if it have any) depends on this, that ſuch a Kind of Faith as that deſcribed Verſe 6. is required to ſuch a ſucceſsful aſking of Wiſdom as that ſpoken of in Verſe 5. is what an unregenerate Sinner cannot poſſibly be the Subject of, but ſuch only as are already in a regenerate State, and ſo truly and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually wiſe; and that the Wiſdom promiſed to be given to ſuch aſkers of it as are intended in the Place, muſt be <hi>more</hi> of the ſame Kind that they are endowed with.</p>
                  <p>Now in Anſwer to this ſeveral Things may be ſaid,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I readily grant, that the Aſking intended in Verſe 5. muſt be an Aſking in Faith: Otherwiſe it is not ſuch as the Promiſe is there made to. And indeed it is, I think, impoſſible, that any Prayer at all ſhould be made to God, without ſome Kind of Faith in him. Prayer is a coming to God for the Favours we need, and deſire him to grant to us. But we are aſſured in Heb. 11.6. that, <hi>he that cometh to God muſt believe that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi> So that there can be no ſuch Thing as coming to God without believing in him. To the ſame Effect is it demanded in
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:005439_0130_1018320730ea9928"/>
Rom. 10.14. <hi>How ſhall they call on him, in whom they have not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved?</hi> As Men cannot, in a gracious and holy Manner, come to or call upon God, without that Kind of Faith which is peculiar to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in a juſtified and regenerate State; ſo they cannot, in any Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, draw near to God, and call on his Name, without ſome Kind of Faith; at leaſt ſuch as unregenerate Perſons may be the Subjects of.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I affirm, that it is poſſible for unregenerate Perſons to believe in God, and in his Son Jeſus Chriſt. Many ſuch have believed. Many unregenerate Perſons have believed there is a God, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.19. And many unregenerate Perſons have had Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, as is evident in <hi>John</hi> 2.23, 24. and Chap. 12.42, 43. <hi>Acts</hi> 8.13. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20, 21. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. That Text therefore, 1 John 5.1. <hi>Whoſoever believeth that Jeſus is the Chriſt, is born of God,</hi> muſt be underſtood of a Kind of Faith or Believing peculiar to God's Elect, already in a regenerate State. The ſame may be ſaid concerning <hi>Peter</hi>'s Faith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16.16, 17. and their's alſo in <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. Otherwiſe I know of no Propoſition in our holy Religion but what may be believed or aſſented unto by Perſons in an unregenerate State. Unregenerate Perſons have the ſame objective Revelation of divine Truths, and the ſame rational Evidence to ground their Perſuaſion of them upon, as the Regenerate have; and this Evidence is ſufficient to demand their Aſſent, and to command it, did they not wilfully refuſe to attend to it. If this were not ſo, unregenerate Perſons that do not aſſent to divine Truths might juſtify their not believing: For no Man is bound to believe that, of which he has not, or cannot have, ſufficient Evidence. For,</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Unregenerate Perſons are able to underſtand the Evidence given or offered to them, to ſatisfy them of the Truth of thoſe Things which they are required to believe; ſo that if they believe them not, 'tis becauſe they ſhun the Light, and will not conſider as they may and ought to do, thoſe Evidences which God favours them with; having an Enmity in their Hearts againſt the Truths and Objects re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. All unregenerate Sinners do not thus obſtinately ſhut their Eyes againſt the Light. They are by common Grace prevail'd with to make a better Improvement of the Advantages they enjoy, than others do. Nor is the Sin of thoſe that refuſe Inſtruction, in this Way offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:005439_0131_101831b6abda6cd8"/>
to them, unavoidable, ſo that they cannot come to the Knowledge of the Truth, but muſt neceſſarily remain Infidels or Unbelievers.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The Perſuaſion which ſome unregenerate Sinners do, in this Way, attain, is ſo firm and ſtrong, that it has a great Influence on their Lives. They receive the Word with Joy, and do many Things that are required of them. Such a Perſuaſion as theſe have, or may have, of the Truth, is ſufficient to produce <hi>Repentance in Sackcloth and Aſhes</hi>; inſomuch that ſuch are ſometimes ſaid to have <hi>eſcaped the Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions that are in the World, thro' the Knowledge of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.20, 21. and to have been <hi>enlightned,</hi> and to have <hi>taſted the heavenly Gift,</hi> and to have been <hi>made Partakers of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and to have <hi>taſted the good Word of God, and the Powers of the World to come,</hi> Heb. 6.4, 5.</p>
                  <p>Such an Aſſurance of divine Truths as Perſons not ſavingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted may, in this Way attain, is ſufficient to render them utterly inexcuſable if they engage not in the Practice of religious Duties, ſuch as Praying to God in publick, private and ſecret; and Waiting on him in all the other Ways of his own Appointment, for his ſaving and everlaſting Mercies, and in particular for that ſpiritual Wiſdom here under Conſideration: So that ſuch Perſons need not be at ſuch Uncertainties, with Reſpect to the Truth of God's Word, as not to aſk theſe Mercies in <hi>Faith</hi>; eſpecially if they are taught, as I think they ſhould be, that God has firmly <hi>promiſed</hi> theſe ſpiritual Bleſſings to thoſe that, in a right Manner, aſk them of him. They may then <hi>aſk them in Faith without wavering, like a Wave of the Sea, that is driven with the Wind, and toſſed,</hi> as in the Text objected: Or like <hi>double-minded Men who are unſtable in all their Ways,</hi> Verſe 8. But on the contrary, they may with ſome Steadfaſtneſs and Conſtancy, <hi>watch at Wiſdom's Gates,</hi> &amp;c. Prov. 8.34. and not <hi>grow weary in well-doing,</hi> nor <hi>draw back to Perdition,</hi> as ſome do. See <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.13. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38. <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.12, 13.</p>
                  <p>I might have here ſhown the Difference betwixt this Kind of Faith, and that peculiar to the Regenerate; but for this I ſhall refer my Reader to Chap. III. of this ſecond Part of my Eſſay: And I ſhall hereafter have Occaſion to ſay ſomething further to it.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIII. That the conditional Promiſes of ſpecial Mercy made to ſuch as come to <hi>JESUS CHRIST,</hi> do contain and imply in them a Promiſe of rengenerating Grace.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Promiſes which I here intend are ſuch as theſe following, <hi>viz.</hi> Matth. 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you Reſt.</hi> John 6.35. <hi>And Jeſus ſaid unto them, I am the Bread of Life: He that cometh to me ſhall never Hunger; and he that believeth on me ſhall never Thirſt.</hi> So again in Verſe 37. <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Such a Promiſe is alſo ſuppoſed and implied in John 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have Life.</hi> In theſe Places Jeſus Chriſt freely invites all ſinful Men, to whom the Goſpel is preached, to come to him for Life and Happineſs, promiſing that if they do, they ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain what they come to him for.</p>
                  <p>Now, this being allowed, as I think it cannot be denied, I ſhall here briefly conſider (1) What the Promiſes are which Sinners ſhould go to Jeſus Chriſt for. (2) How they ſhould go to Chriſt for theſe Benefits. (3) The Security given them, that ſo doing, they ſhall obtain them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us conſider what thoſe Benefits are which Sinners are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to go to Jeſus Chriſt for. Now to this I ſay in general, that there is no Reaſon to doubt but that they are invited to go to Chriſt for all ſpiritual Bleſſings, or for all thoſe everlaſting Mercies which he freely beſtows on all thoſe whom he eternally ſaves; all that Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which he has in himſelf, and which is by his People derived from him, as in <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19. <hi>John</hi> 1.14, 16. That Pardon of Sin, or Juſtification and Adoption are among thoſe Bleſſings, which Sinners are invited to go to Chriſt for, is not, I think, at all queſtion'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:005439_0133_101831b9b3801cd0"/>
us; and ſo alſo the Happineſs enjoy'd by true Saints in their Communion with God here in this Life, and in that which is to come.</p>
                  <p>All the Queſtion here is, whether unregenerate Sinners who enjoy ſuch Invitations by the Goſpel, as thoſe above expreſſed, are not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in invited to go to Jeſus Chriſt alſo for that Principle of ſpiritual Life which is given in Regeneration? And this I am perſuaded they are; and can hardly think that any orthodox Divine will deny it. Is not every unregenerate Sinner who enjoys the Goſpel, bound to pray as <hi>David</hi> did in Pſal. 51.10. <hi>Create in me a clean Heart, O God; and renew a right Spirit within me.</hi> Indeed, we have no Reaſon to doubt of <hi>David</hi>'s being in a regenerate State, when he thus prayed: But it being after his great Sin and Fall, as appears by the Title of the Pſalm, and is further confirmed by the Contents of it, he may be juſtly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been under a Cloud, with reſpect to his ſpiritual State, and to have wanted that Senſe of God's Love, which formerly he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. Several of his Expreſſions in the Pſalm lead us to think ſo; it is therefore no Wonder if he now called the Sincerity of his Heart, and the Truth of his Converſion, in Queſtion, and ſo prayed for a new Heart, as if he had never before had ſuch an Heart given to him: But he could not deſire this but only on Suppoſition that he had not already what he was concerned that he might not fail of. And thus any Saint that knows not that he is already in a regenerate State, may pray that he may be born again. And thoſe that are indeed deſtitute of true Grace ſhould pray for it as <hi>Ephraim</hi> did, Jer. 31.18. <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned</hi>: And that is to go to Chriſt, and to God in and by him, for it. We are told, in Acts 5.31. That <hi>he is exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour; to grant Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins</hi>; no Doubt the Grace of true Repentance, as well as the Acts and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of it: And this ſhews us that Sinners ſhould go to him for this Grace, as unto one that has the Words of eternal Life, <hi>John</hi> 6.68. The wicked <hi>Jews</hi> refuſing to do this, was no Doubt one great Part of the Crime with which our Lord charged them, John 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come unto me that ye might have Life.</hi> Or, ſhall we ſuppoſe they were only to go to Chriſt for Pardon, and not for the Grace of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, which he alſo merited for his People, and which they can <hi>have</hi> no other Way than thro' him, who is that Head of Influence, by which his whole Body is animated and nouriſhed,; and who <hi>having Life in himſelf, quickneth whom he will,</hi> Col. 1.18, 19. and <hi>John</hi> 1.16. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 5.26, 27. Thus, I think it is ſufficiently evident, that unregenerate Perſons ought to go to Jeſus Chriſt for ſpiritual Life, or for the Grace of Regeneration.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="119" facs="unknown:005439_0134_1018320e64e0c008"/>2. I am to ſhew how Sinners are to go to him for this Grace. And here I will venture to ſay <hi>negatively,</hi> They are not required to go to him for it in the Exerciſe of the ſame Kind of Grace. Is it poſſible for any rational Men to think, that God requiring unregenerate Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to go to Jeſus Chriſt for a Principle of ſpiritual Life, which they are yet without, would require them to come to him for it, in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of that very ſame Kind of Grace which he requires them to ſeek after, and beg for? This is too abſurd to be believed.</p>
                  <p>What then, are the Unregenerate in ſeeking to Jeſus Chriſt for the Grace of Regeneration, required to come to him in Faith, or without any? Surely they are not required to come to Chriſt without Faith: That would be a ſtrange Way of coming, if any at all. How ſhould they come to their Saviour without having any Faith in him? It is impoſſible. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. How ſhould Perſons call on Jeſus Chriſt, as in Mat. 8.25. <hi>Lord, ſave us, we periſh</hi>; or as in Verſe 2. <hi>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canſt make me clean,</hi> if they do not believe him able to do theſe Things for them? And the Reaſon is the ſame if we go to him for a new Heart, or to give us ſpiritual Life.</p>
                  <p>But how ſhould Perſons go to Chriſt <hi>in Faith,</hi> for ſuch a Mercy, who are not yet born again?</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, That the <hi>Myſtery is this,</hi> that Perſons may have Faith in Chriſt, tho' they are not yet born of the Spirit, as in <hi>John</hi> 3.16, or have not yet been <hi>made Partakers of the divine Nature,</hi> as in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. I have proved this in Chap. XII. to which I here refer my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And I am not yet convinced, that it is impoſſible for a Sinner not yet born of God, and that has no other Faith than a Perſon in that Eſtate may have, to go to Chriſt for regenerating Grace, or for a new Heart; but I am thoro'ly convinced, that no Sinner is required to go to Chriſt for the Grace of Regeneration, in the Exerciſe of the ſame Kind of Grace.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. We may now conſider the Security given to all that come to Chriſt, in the Manner intended, that they ſhall obtain the Benefits conditionally promiſed to them; and ſo with the reſt, the Grace of Regeneration: And the Promiſe for this is as full and expreſs in the Places quoted, as can be deſired. Such <hi>ſhall never Hunger nor thirſt,</hi> John 6.35. Chriſt will by no Means <hi>caſt them out,</hi> Verſe 37. They ſhall <hi>find Reſt to their Souls,</hi> Matth. 11.28. Which Promiſes can never be made good to ſuch as go to Jeſus Chriſt for his everlaſting Mercies offered to them in the Goſpel, unleſs the Grace of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:005439_0135_101831bd0b1733f0"/>
be beſtowed on them, <hi>that</hi> being one of thoſe for which they are invited to go to him, as I have already ſhewed. And, as if a Promiſe without an Oath had not been ſufficient, both have been (for the better Satisfaction of ſuch as by Reaſon of Infirmity need it) given to them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18. The Promiſe and Oath of God here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, does not only afford Matter of Conſolation to ſuch as have already <hi>fled for Refuge, to lay hold on the Hope ſet before them</hi>; but alſo great Encouragement to others to do ſo, who have not yet done it. Nor ought Sinners to ſtay till they are born of the Spirit, before they begin thus to do; tho' they ſhould continue coming to Chriſt after they are born of God, as appears in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2, 3, 4. Thoſe who intend never to go to God in Chriſt for his ſaving Mercies, will be in great Danger of going forever without them.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIV. That there are conditional Promiſes made in the Goſpel, to ſuch as <hi>PERSEVERE</hi> and <hi>OVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COME,</hi> which contain in them Offers of the Grace of <hi>Regeneration.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> IN the preſent Argument, join together the two Sorts of Promiſes mentioned, becauſe of their near Relation one to the other; the End of Perſeverance being our overcoming the Evils we have to meet with, in the Way that leadeth to eternal Life.</p>
                  <p>However, I ſhall firſt conſider thoſe Promiſes of Salvation, which are made to ſuch as perſevere: And here I ſhall <hi>firſt</hi> ſhew that there are ſeveral ſuch Promiſes: And then, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> make it evident that theſe contain an Offer of regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating Grace in them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> I will Inſtance in ſeveral ſuch Promiſes: And ſuch an one is that, which we have, in Matth. 10.22. and Chap. 24.13. <hi>He that endureth to the End ſhall be ſaved.</hi> If the Circumſtances of the Places wherein this Promiſe is found, be duly conſidered, none can reaſonably doubt that the Salvation intended in it is that which is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:005439_0136_101832132ac50d08"/>
elſewhere in Scripture called <hi>eternal Life</hi>: And that the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on which this Salvation is offered, is Perſeverance, is, I think, undeniable. It is called, in the Words under Conſideration, <hi>Endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the End,</hi> the direct contrary to that <hi>Enduring</hi> and <hi>Believing</hi> only <hi>for a while,</hi> which Apoſtates are chargeable with, as appears in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.21. <hi>Mark</hi> 4.17. and <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. Such a Promiſe is that alſo in <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.4. Such a Promiſe is alſo in Hoſ. 6.3. <hi>Then ſhall we know, if we follow on to know the Lord: His going forth is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared as the Morning; and he ſhall come unto us as the Rain; as the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and former Rain unto the Earth. To follow on to know the Lord,</hi> is to perſevere in our Endeavours to get that ſaving Acquaintance with him, ſpoken of <hi>Job</hi> 22.21. And his <hi>coming unto ſuch as the Rain,</hi> doubtleſs importeth the plentiful Effuſion of the Holy Spirit on them, in his converting and ſaving Influences, as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23. and <hi>Iſai.</hi> 44.34, 35. Another ſuch Promiſe we have in Gal. 6.9. <hi>Let us not be weary in Well-doing, for in due Time we ſhall reap, if we faint not.</hi> Which Promiſe, I ſuppoſe, to be given to ſuch as have begun to ſeek the Lord, whether they are in a regenerate State or not. With theſe Texts we may compare what we have in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.23. and Verſe 35,—39. which I may hereafter have Occaſion to conſider. Alſo that in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24, 26. Some there are that fail and fall ſhort of eternal Life and Happineſs, by Means of their Apoſtacy from God, and their Duty; but theſe are not ſuch as have been regenerated by the Holy Spirit, but ſuch as have been in the Way to obtain this Mercy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall now proceed to ſhew that ſuch Promiſes as theſe contain in them an Offer of the Grace given in Regeneration. And to make this good, the firſt Thing I ſhall ſay is, that they are not made to ſuch as are already in a State of Grace and Salvation, <hi>i. e.</hi> to ſuch as are in a regenerate and juſtified State, and ſo already <hi>paſſed from Death to Life,</hi> as in <hi>John</hi> 5.24. and 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.14. God does not tell ſuch as theſe, that if they do not <hi>fall from Grace,</hi> and again become ſuch as the <hi>unregenerate</hi> are, they ſhall be ſaved; as if their future Salvation were ſtill ſuſpended on this Condition, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main true Believers all the Days of their Lives. Such as theſe have already performed the Conditions on which Salvation is offered to Sinners, and have begun to partake of that Salvation, which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows on all who comply with the Terms of the new Covenant; and all that remains neceſſary for the perfecting of it is by the Promiſe and Oath of God ſecured to them. They may depend upon his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting all that concerns them, even their Perſeverance in Faith and Holineſs to the End is fully ſecured to them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:005439_0137_101831c1810b3258"/>
3, 4, 5. The Promiſe of Salvation which they have already a Right unto, includes in it a Promiſe of their Perſeverance, in Faith and Holineſs, even unto Death. Their Perſeverance therefore, rather dependeth on their Salvation, than their Salvation on their Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: How then can their eternal Salvation be ſuſpended on this Condition, if they perſevere. I wonder any <hi>Calviniſt</hi> ſhould thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the mentioned Promiſes ſo very inconſiſtently with the Principles profeſſed by them, and, as I ſhall ſhew, with the plain Senſe of the Places wherein ſuch Promiſes are found. It is too late to tell Men they ſhall be ſaved on thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> or that Condition, after their Salvation is fully ſecured, with all Things neceſſarily implied in it.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>third</hi> Thing which I have to ſay reſpecting the Promiſes under Conſideration, is, that they ſuppoſe the Perſons to whom they are made, to be already ſo far forth qualified Subjects to partake of the Good promiſed, that Nothing is wanting in order to it, but their Continuance or Perſeverance in the Way of Duty, in which they are at preſent walking: For Perſeverance is all that is now demanded of them, in order to their being Partakers of the Benefits conditionally promiſed to them. Unto ſuch therefore <hi>that</hi> belongs, Heb. 10.36. <hi>Ye have need of Patience, that after ye have done the Will of God, ye might receive the Promiſe.</hi> Unto thoſe alſo that is ſpoken Gal. 6.9. <hi>Let us not be weary in Well-doing,</hi> &amp;c. Not that ſuch Perſons have already a Right to the ſaving Mercies of the new Covenant; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in due Time they ſhall have an Intereſt in them, if they go on in the Way they are in, and do not grow weary and give out. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare with the Text laſt mentioned, that in <hi>Luke</hi> 18.1, 7. The Perſons therefore, unto whom ſuch Promiſes are made, are (tho' not in a regenerate State) ſuch as are <hi>ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait Gate,</hi> Luke 13.24. Or <hi>preſſing to enter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> (or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it) <hi>Luke</hi> 16.16. being ſuch convinced and awakened Sinners as have <hi>begun to work out their own Salvation with Fear and Trembling,</hi> Phil. 2.12. and conſequently are ſuch as believe the Word of God, both Law and Goſpel, tho' not with that Kind of Faith as is infuſed into Men's Souls, in their Regeneration. And tho' they are not ſavingly converted, in the Senſe in which that Expreſſion is generally uſed; yet they have a Repentance like that intended in <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.21. and are ſuch as have <hi>eſcaped the Pollutions that are in the World, thro' the Knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.20. And are alſo in a <hi>Way of Well-doing, watching at Wiſdom's Gates, and waiting at the Poſts of her Doors,</hi> Prov. 8, 34.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="unknown:005439_0138_10183216794d2c98"/>Thus the Perſons intended are ſuppoſed to be ſerious and diligent Seekers of God, in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, for his ſpecial and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Mercies, tho' not in a regenerate and juſtified Eſtate. And Perſons qualified as now expreſſed, are, I ſay, qualified to be Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of the ſaving Benefits offered in the new Covenant; ſo that 'tis no Ways inconſiſtent with the Truth, Juſtice and Holineſs of God, to beſtow theſe ſaving and eternal Mercies on them: Yet he has not bound himſelf by any Promiſe, that he will immediately ſave a Sinner ſo qualified; but is pleaſed to require Sinners under ſuch Preparations to wait on him during his Pleaſure, for the Beſtowment of the ſame upon them: Only he has, (as I think) for their Encouragement, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged that they ſhall in due Time <hi>reap</hi> theſe Fruits of his ſpecial Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour <hi>if they faint not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now, that Perſons may be thus qualified to be Partakers of God's everlaſting Mercies, and yet not immediately have the ſame beſtowed on them, but be obliged to wait God's Time, under ſuch Preparations, and this under Pain of falling finally ſhort of the Mercies which they ſeek, in Caſe they perſevere not, I ſhall endeavour a little further to clear up.</p>
                  <p>This would indeed be impoſſible, if that Kind of Faith, by Divines called <hi>Fides infuſa,</hi> were the Condition of the new Covenant; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch Faith neceſſarily ſuppoſeth all that have it to be in a State of Salvation, as I have already ſhewed. But that Kind of Faith and Repentance, which I look upon as the Condition of the Covenant of Grace, is evidently, in the Nature of it, ſuch as Perſons may have before they are in a State of Salvation; and therefore it may be a Truth, (and indeed it evidently is ſo) that Perſeverance is required of ſuch as would be Partakers of God's ſaving Mercies, in order to their obtaining them; and not only that for a Moment they are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified, as has been expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>This will be further manifeſt, if we conſider, that we may well diſtinguiſh betwixt a Condition on which a Benefit is offered, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered materially, or in Reſpect of the Act or Acts wherein it conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and conſidered with Reſpect to the Prolongation or Continuance of the Thing required: If we conſider the Nature of the Things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, Perſons may, in that Reſpect, have all that is demanded of them, and yet not have a Right to the Benefits conditionally promiſed; becauſe they have not continued the Qualifications demanded, ſo long as is required of them, in order to their having a Right.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="unknown:005439_0139_101831c3c8339048"/>Thus in the firſt Covenant made with Man, he might for a Time continue in that Obedience which was required of him, and yet have no Right to the Life conditionally promiſed; becauſe he had not ſtood in Innocency the whole Term of that State of Probation which was by God deſigned for his Trial. And I know no Reaſon why it may not be ſo under the new Covenant alſo; nay, it ſeems certainly to be ſo, inaſmuch as God does not only require ſuch Qualifications as are mentioned in the Covenant, but alſo Perſeverance in the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of what is required; that is, God requires that we keep Covenant with him, in order to his ſaving us; and this not by one tranſient Act only, but by our conſtant Obedience to his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, 'till we obtain his offered Mercies, as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.10. and 103.17, 18.</p>
                  <p>That the Senſe which I have given of the Promiſes under Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is very agreeable with the Scope of the Places wherein we find them, will (I think) appear if we conſider them in Connection with the Context, to which they reſpectively belong. In that <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.22. thoſe Chriſtians to whom the Promiſe intended has a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, are ſuppoſed to be liable to violent Perſecutions, under which they would be in great Danger of falling away, as ſtony-ground Hearers are many of them ſuppoſed to do, in <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.20, 21. and in the other Evangeliſts. They are therefore encouraged with a Promiſe of Salvation, in Caſe they ſhould perſevere, which they would not have been in Danger of not doing, if they had been <hi>paſſed from Death to Life,</hi> in the Senſe intended in <hi>John</hi> 5.24. Thoſe in <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.13. are ſpoken to as liable to grievous Temptations, by Reaſon of that abounding of Iniquity there foretold, which ſhould occaſion <hi>the Love of many to wax cold,</hi> as in Verſe 12. and ſo are encouraged to take Heed of Apoſtacy, from the Conſideration of that gracious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe made to ſuch as perſevere; <hi>viz.</hi> that if they ſhould <hi>endure to the End,</hi> they ſhould <hi>be ſaved</hi>; they believing only <hi>for a while,</hi> as in <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. I may here add, that when ſome, in the mentioned Place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13. have Salvation promiſed to them, in Caſe they ſhould not fall away, as others would do; the Antitheſis expreſſed in the Words plainly ſhew, that the ſame Kind of Faith or Religion is intended in both Caſes: So that of the ſame Sort of Believers ſome might fall away, and periſh, and others perſevere, and be ſaved: And if thoſe who are ſuppoſed to fall away, ſhould not do ſo, but ſhould continue to believe, they ſhould be ſaved alſo.</p>
                  <p>The like may be ſaid with Reſpect to that Text, Heb. 10.36, 38, 39. <hi>Ye have Need of Patience; that after ye have done the Will of God,
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:005439_0140_1018321808aa1fd8"/>
ye may receive the Promiſe. Now the Juſt ſhall live by Faith: But if any Man</hi> (or, as it is in the Original, I am told, <hi>if he) draw back, my Soul ſhall have no Pleaſure in him. But we are not of them that draw back unto Perdition, but of them that believe to the ſaving of the Soul.</hi> I believe it can never be proved that the Faith intended in Verſe 38. is that which is peculiar to the Regenerate; but the contrary ſeems evident. I grant that, according to the Text, the Faith intended is of the ſame Kind with that by which the Juſt do live, that is, it is of the ſame Kind of Faith with that which is required as the Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Covenant of Grace: And what Kind of Faith that is, I have ſufficiently ſhewed, and proved it cannot be that given in Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Moreover, when it is ſaid, That <hi>the Juſt ſhall live by Faith,</hi> and it thereupon followeth, <hi>If any Man draw back,</hi> &amp;c. it ſeemeth evident, that the ſame Kind of Faith is by ſome fallen from, which others perſevere in the Exerciſe of, to the ſaving of their Souls. Therefore, when it is ſaid, <hi>The Juſt ſhall live by Faith,</hi> the Meaning is, That he ſhall do ſo, in Caſe he perſevere in Believing, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinueth a juſt and righteous Man, in the Senſe in which he is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſuch an one; which many not doing, God's Soul has no ſuch Pleaſure in them, as he has in thoſe who ſo do. And tho' ſuch as are the Subjects of the Faith intended, are called <hi>Juſt,</hi> this may not intend that they are ſo in the ſtricteſt Senſe of that Word, any more than that the Term <hi>Righteous,</hi> muſt be ſo taken, in (what I think to be) a parallel Place, in Ezek. 18.24, 26. <hi>But if the Righteous turneth away from his Righteouſneſs, and commit Iniquity, and doth according to the Abominations that the wicked Man doth, ſhall he live? All his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs that he hath done, ſhall not be mentioned; in his Treſpaſs that he hath treſpaſſed, and in his Sin that he hath ſinned, in them ſhall he die. When a righteous Man turneth away from his Righteouſneſs, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Iniquity, and dieth in them, for his Iniquity that he hath done ſhall he die.</hi> In which Words it is to me ſo evident, that by a righteous Man, a regenerate Saint cannot be intended, that I think I need not ſpend Time in making the ſame manifeſt, nor am I alone in this Tho't; ſuch a one being ſpoken of as falling ſhort of Life and Happineſs, by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away from that Righteouſneſs which he once had, when otherwiſe he might and ſhould have lived. Compare this Place with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.20. and 33.18. The Righteous intended in theſe Places are, I ſuppoſe, ſuch as are mentioned in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21. and there ſaid to <hi>have eſcaped the Pollutions of the World, thro' the Knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and to <hi>have known the Way of Righteouſneſs,</hi> but to <hi>turn again from the holy Commandment.</hi> That ſuch righteous Perſons as theſe ſhall be ſaved, if they perſevere in ſuch Faith and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:005439_0141_101831c784098dd8"/>
as they have attained to, is what I here endeavour to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain: Not that any can be ſaved without Regeneration; for Man's Regeneration is his Salvation, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. But my Meaning is, that ſuch as ſo believe and obey, ſhall obtain both Juſtification and Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if they perſevere in ſo doing: Otherwiſe, ſuch as perſevere ſhould not be ſaved, according to the mentioned Promiſes.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now proceed to conſider the ſecond Sort of Promiſes inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be inſiſted on in this Argument, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe wherein ſpecial Mercies are engaged to ſuch as <hi>overcome</hi>; and in which I ſuppoſe the Grace of Regeneration to be conditionally promiſed. I ſhall at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent only inſiſt on two Places, in which, I ſuppoſe, we have ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. The firſt of theſe is in Rev. 2.17. <hi>To him that overcometh, will I give to eat of the hidden Manna, and will give him a white Stone, and in this Stone a new Name written, which no Man knoweth, ſaving he that receiveth it.</hi> The ſecond Place I intend, is in Rev. 3.12. <hi>Him that overcometh will I make a Pillar in the Temple of my God; and he ſhall go no more out. And I will write upon him the Name of my God, and the Name of the City of my God, which is the new Jeruſalem, which cometh down out of Heaven from my God; and I will write upon him my new Name.</hi> With Reſpect to theſe Places we may conſider, (1) The Subjects unto whom theſe Promiſes are made. (2) The Promiſes made unto theſe Subjects, and that by Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, whoſe Words theſe are.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then, the Subjects unto whom theſe Promiſes are made are ſuch as <hi>overcome.</hi> For <hi>to him that overcometh,</hi> &amp;c. which Words being ſpoken <hi>indifinitely,</hi> muſt be underſtood of all that overcome, whoever they be. But the Objects over whom the Victory intended is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be obtained, is not here expreſſed, but muſt be underſtood from what is ſaid in Scripture, with Reſpect to that Warfare, wherein Chriſtians are engaged againſt <hi>the Fleſh, the World,</hi> and <hi>the Devil,</hi> as in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.10,—17. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.11. and many other Places. From whence we may gather, that the Victory intended, is over all the Enemies of our Souls. Theſe are the Things which we muſt overcome, if we would have the Benefits promiſed in the Words before us.</p>
                  <p>But we muſt conſider when or how theſe Things may be ſaid to be overcome. Now, here it is very neceſſary that we obſerve, that there are two Periods, in which, or remarkable Degrees of Victory, with Reſpect whereunto, Profeſſors of Religion may be ſaid to overcome
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:005439_0142_10183219e6e69670"/>
their ſpiritual Enemies, or to gain the Victory over them. One of theſe is when they are firſt ſavingly united unto Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo intitled thro' his Merits, to the everlaſting Mercies offered in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. The other is when they are actually poſſeſſed of all the Good which Jeſus Chriſt has purchaſed for them; and which God hath from Eternity purpoſed to beſtow; and are alſo perfectly freed from all the Evils which their Sin and Fall had brought on them. Now of theſe two remarkable Seaſons and Degrees of the Chriſtian's Victory, it will be to my preſent Purpoſe to ſay ſomething, eſpecially of the firſt of them; becauſe they ought here to be carefully diſtinguiſhed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt</hi> then, Profeſſors of Religion may be ſaid to overcome Sin, the World, and the Devil, even all the Enemies of Souls, when by Faith they obtain an Intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo are united to him, and thro' Grace entitled to all the ſure and everlaſting Mercies of the new Covenant, offered to ſinful Men in the Goſpel. Whenever any of the ſinful Children of Men are thus intereſted in Jeſus Chriſt, their Sins are all pardoned, and their Perſons juſtified, by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to them. They are reconciled unto God, adopted into the Number of his Children, being regenerated by his Spirit, and ſo made new Creatures; And their future Happineſs is as fully ſecured to them, whether they know it or not, as if they were actually in the Poſſeſſion of the Glory of the World to come: So that now their State is that expreſſed, John 5.24. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, he that heareth my Word, and believeth on him that ſent me, hath everlaſting Life; and ſhall not come into Condemnation, but is paſſed from Death to Life.</hi> And Rom. 8.1, 2. <hi>There is therefore now no Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit. For the Law of the Spirit in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death.</hi> With theſe Places do many others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, ſome of which I ſhall only here refer to, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32,—39. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.14. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. <hi>John</hi> 3.29. 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.28. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.12. <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.7, 8. <hi>John</hi> 10.27, 29. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3,—5.</p>
                  <p>When eternal Happineſs is thus ſecured to any of the Children of Men, they may be well ſaid to have overcome; (tho' they are not paſt having any new Aſſault made on them by their ſpiritual Enemies, and ſuffering greatly by them) ſo that it may be ſaid to every true Saint, as in 1 John 2.13. <hi>Ye have overcome the wicked one.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore holy <hi>Paul,</hi> being juſtified by Faith in Chriſt, could ſay, as in 2 Tim. 4.7, 8. <hi>I have fought the good Fight, I have finiſhed my Courſe, I have kept the Faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of

Righteouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give me at that Day; and not to me only, but unto all them alſo that love his Appearing.</hi> Note here, that theſe Words of the Apoſtle, <hi>I have kept the Faith,</hi> cannot mean that he had perſevered to the End of his Life; but that he had done ſo, till he had ſecured his future and eternal Happineſs, as in the fore-mentioned <hi>John</hi> 5.24. And ſuch a Victory has every godly Man obtained over the Enemies of his Soul, tho' many ſuch are not, as <hi>Paul,</hi> aſſured of this.</p>
                  <p>But there is yet, <hi>Secondly,</hi> a further Victory to be ſought and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Chriſtians, over their ſpiritual Enemies, and all Things that hinder their compleat Happineſs, even over all the Evils that trouble and moleſt them: For which Victory they muſt wait patiently, 'till their ſpiritual Warfare be fully accompliſhed, which it will not be while they live in this World: Nay, their laſt Enemy will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, 'till their Reſurrection from the Dead, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.26. Now the Chriſtian's Progreſs towards this compleat Victory is but gradual after the firſt Victory mentioned is obtained, and will be perfect when the good Day arrives, wherein they ſhall behold God's Face in Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and all their Tears ſhall be wiped away.</p>
                  <p>If it be now inquired which of theſe Victories thus deſcribed, is that intended and refered to in the Places under Conſideration, as that which qualifies the Subjects that obtain it, for the Benefits pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to ſuch as overcome; unto this I anſwer, That the firſt of theſe two Victories deſcribed muſt needs be that intended in the Places here diſcourſed on; becauſe the Promiſes in them made to ſuch as are Victorious, are of Things belonging, according to the Tenor of the new Covenant, to ſuch as overcome, in the firſt Senſe explained.</p>
                  <p>This will be evident if we conſider what the Benefits are, here promiſed to victorious Chriſtians. And in the firſt of theſe Places men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, (<hi>viz. Rev.</hi> 2.17.) the Things by our Saviour promiſed to be given to ſuch, are theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> (1) He will give ſuch an one to eat of the <hi>hidden Manna.</hi> (2) He will give him a <hi>white Stone.</hi> (3) In that Stone, <hi>a new Name written, which no Man knoweth, ſaving him that receiveth it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the other Place inſiſted on, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.12. the Things promiſed to the Victorious are theſe following, <hi>viz.</hi> Firſt, <hi>I will,</hi> ſaith our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, <hi>make him a Pillar in the Temple of my God; and he ſhall go no more out.</hi> Secondly, <hi>I will,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>write upon him the Name of my God, and the Name of the City of my God, which is the new Jeruſalem, which cometh down out of Heaven from my God: And I will write upon him my new Name.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="129" facs="unknown:005439_0144_101832201e242408"/>Now can it be imagined by any one who duly conſiders what is intended in theſe Promiſes, that the Subjects unto whom they are made, are ſuch as have obtained a full Victory over all their ſpiritual Enemies, ſo as no more to be diſturbed by them? Nay, is it not evident, that the Benefits in theſe Promiſes engaged, are actually given and granted to all ſuch as are victorious in the firſt Senſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained? Tho' it be true, that they are ſtill in a militant State, fighting under the Banner of Jeſus Chriſt, the Captain of their Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet their final Victory is fully ſecured. Is it not evident that Jeſus Chriſt is the <hi>hidden Manna</hi> intended in the mentioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17? And is it not equally clear, that all true Believers do now feed on that Bread of Life? as our Saviour ſheweth in <hi>John</hi> 6.48,—58. Is it not evident that the <hi>white Stone</hi> promiſed, is given to every rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and juſtified Soul? Is not every true Saint favoured with this precious Gift? Is not the <hi>white Stone</hi> here intended, the ſame Thing that is elſewhere called <hi>a new and clean Heart, the Seed of God, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, the Image of God,</hi> &amp;c.? And is not this an infallible Sign and Token of the Juſtification of the Perſon it is given to? Even as the white Stones which were of old given in Courts of Juſtice, to ſuch as were cleared or judged innocent, were given as a Sign of their Juſtification.
<q>They, ſaith <hi>Pareus</hi> on this Place, come neareſt the literal Meaning, who think that Chriſt in this reſpecteth the Manner of Judgment, where there were two Sorts of Stones caſt into a Baſon; by the <hi>White</hi> the Innocent were abſolved; by the <hi>Black</hi> the Guilty were condemned.</q>
So that, according to <hi>Pareus,</hi> the giving of a white Stone ſignified that the Perſon was juſtified to whom it was given, tho' he has not yet obtained a perfect Victory over Sin and Satan. It is alſo true that a <hi>new Name</hi> written in the white Stone here mentioned, is given in and with it, and by every true Believer received. This is that Name which God has promiſed to ſuch as <hi>keep his Sabbaths,</hi> and <hi>chooſe the Things that pleaſe him,</hi> and <hi>take hold of his Covenant,</hi> Iſai. 56.4, 5. <hi>Even unto them,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>will I give in mine Houſe, and within my Walls, a Place and a Name bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than that of Sons and Daughters. I will give them an everlaſting Name that ſhall not be cut off.</hi> The ſame Name is intended in 1 John 3.1. <hi>Behold, what Manner of Love the Father hath beſtowed upon us, that we ſhould be called the</hi> SONS OF GOD. Nor is this a Name only, but both the Name and what is ſignified by it, as by the next Words appeareth. <hi>Beloved, now are we the Sons of God,</hi> &amp;c. with which compare 2 Cor. 6.17, 18. <hi>I will be a Father unto you, and ye ſhall be my Sons and Daughters, ſaith the Lord almighty.</hi> This is a Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege belonging to every true Saint.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="130" facs="unknown:005439_0145_101831cc2f151da8"/>The ſame may be ſaid with Reſpect to the Privileges or Benefits promiſed in the other Place mentioned, Rev. 3.12. Every ſuch an one is <hi>made a Pillar in the Temple of God, that ſhall go no more out,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But for the further clearing up of this Point, it muſt be here obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, That we muſt carefully diſtinguiſh betwixt the Victory Men may be ſaid to obtain over Sin and Satan, in they Way of their own Duty, while they are called to ſtrive againſt them, in a Courſe of Well-doing, and that which they obtain by what God himſelf does for them, when they have ſo far overcome, thro' his Grace aſſiſting them, as to have done what is required <hi>on their Part,</hi> in order to God's doing for them what is neceſſary <hi>on his,</hi> for the perfecting of that Victory, which is deſired and endeavoured after.</p>
                  <p>Now, Man may be ſaid, on his Part, to overcome and be victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, when he has thro' Grace ſo far prevailed, as to have come up to the Terms of the Covenant, wherein everlaſting Mercies are offered and conditionally promiſed to him: And yet his Victory cannot be ſaid to be compleated, (taking in God's Part of the Work) till God has alſo performed the Promiſe made to Man, on Condition of his doing what on his Part is required. Thus diſtinguiſhing, we may truly affirm, that Man muſt firſt overcome ſo far as is required of him, before he may expect that God will perfect his Victory, by doing what he hath conditionally promiſed.</p>
                  <p>And thus it may be affirmed, that a Sinner muſt himſelf firſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, before God will <hi>give him to eat of the hidden Manna; give him a white Stone, with a new Name written in it; make him a Pillar in the Temple of God, that ſhall go no more out; write on him the Name of God,</hi> &amp;c. All which denote God's granting his ſaving and ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Mercies to him, as I have ſhewed above; but all ſuch Mercies are given in the Way of a Covenant, the Condition of which muſt be complied with, before a Sinner can, in that Way, obtain them: Nor does our coming up to the Terms of the Covenant ſuppoſe or imply our having any ſuch Mercy before we ſo do. I intend ſuch Mercies as Regeneration and Juſtification are. And yet I ſhall not doubt to affirm that no Sinner ever complied with the Terms of the new Covenant, without having the diſtinguiſhing Grace of God magnified towards him; and this I hope I ſhall make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt before I have done.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XV. That Sinners do therefore periſh, becauſe they receive not the Love of the Truth, that they may be ſaved, an Argument that they have an Offer of true Holineſs made to them.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> GROUND the Argument propoſed in the Title of this Chapter, on the Text alluded to in it, <hi>viz.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.10. where the Apoſtle ſpeaking of <hi>them that periſh,</hi> under the antichriſtian Apoſtacy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that they therefore periſh, <hi>becauſe they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not the Love of the Truth, that they might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> Now I ſhall endeavour to ſhew how theſe Words ſerve to my Purpoſe, by conſidering (1) What we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand by their <hi>periſhing,</hi> who fail of the <hi>Salvation</hi> mentioned in the Text. And (2) The Reaſon given <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>heir periſhing as they do. (3) The Inference that I draw from hence, <hi>viz.</hi> That this ſhews, that they have an Offer of a Principle of true Grace or Holineſs made to them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Then, I will conſider what is meant by their <hi>periſhing,</hi> who <hi>recieve not the Love of the Truth, that they might be ſaved.</hi> Now this may be the better underſtood, if we conſider what that <hi>Salvation</hi> is, which is oppoſed thereunto: For there is no Doubt but that the Perdition of thoſe that periſh, and the Salvation of thoſe that periſh not, but have everlaſting Life, are ſo naturally oppoſed one to the other, as to inſtruct us in the Nature of each of them, if we compare them together.</p>
                  <p>Now by <hi>Salvation</hi> we are not here to underſtand that Happineſs only, which thoſe that ſhall attain to it, ſhall enjoy in the World to come; but it does compriſe in it alſo the <hi>preparing</hi> ſuch <hi>Veſſels of Mercy</hi> for the Enjoyment of that <hi>Glory</hi> which is intended for them: And thus this Salvation does include in it, Men's being <hi>ſaved from their Sins,</hi> as
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:005439_0147_101831cf8acefba8"/>
in <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. <hi>i. e.</hi> not only the Pardon of them, but alſo their Regeneration and Sanctification. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.25, 26. But I need not here enlarge on this Particular, having at large conſidered what is meant by the Salvation of Sinners, in Part I. Chap. II. to which Place I refer my Reader.</p>
                  <p>But now, if we underſtand this of ſuch periſhing of Sinners as is fitly oppoſed to the Salvation of thoſe that believe, we ſhall find it to comprehend much more in it, than the Pain and Torment endured by the Wicked in <hi>another World, viz.</hi> Their being ſuffered to remain under the Guilt and Power of Sin, in <hi>This</hi>; and ſo to <hi>pine away in their Iniquities,</hi> and <hi>die in their Sins,</hi> without Repentance, and without a Pardon, in a State of Condemnation, and having the Wrath of God abiding on them; the Caſe of all ſuch as fall ſhort of the Salvation of God; as is in the holy Scriptures abundantly declared. I ſhall only refer to ſome of the Places declaring ſo much. Thoſe who pleaſe, may read and compare ſuch as theſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33, 10. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 22.14. <hi>John</hi> 8.21, 24. and Chap. 3.36. The Unregenerate and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtified are <hi>dead in Sin</hi>: And to remain in that State is to periſh, as well as to be puniſhed for Sin in the Life to come.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I proceed to conſider the <hi>Reaſon</hi> why ſuch <hi>periſh,</hi> as do ſo. Now this is fully and plainly expreſſed in the Place under Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: And they therefore periſh <hi>becauſe they receive not the Love of the Truth, that they may be ſaved.</hi> Now, to clear up this, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, (1) What is here intended by the <hi>Truth.</hi> (2) What is meant by the <hi>Love</hi> of it. (3) What we may underſtand by Perſons <hi>receiving</hi> this Love. (4) That Sinners <hi>might be ſaved</hi> if they would do this. (5) That they periſh <hi>becauſe</hi> they refuſe thus to do.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us <hi>firſt</hi> conſider what is here meant by the <hi>Truth.</hi> Now, tho' the Word <hi>Truth,</hi> has many Acceptations in Scripture; yet there is no Doubt but that by the Word <hi>Truth</hi> we may here underſtand all the divine Truth which God has revealed and made known unto Man, in order to his Duty and Happineſs, both by his Works and by his Word; eſpecially in the Goſpel of his Son Jeſus Chriſt: This great Truth comprehendeth in it, all thoſe excellent and glorious Truths, which are neceſſary for Mankind to underſtand and believe, in order to their Well-being; eſpecially thoſe that relate to the Way of Man's Redemption by Jeſus Chriſt, and Regeneration by the holy Spirit. This Collection of ſacred Truths, is emphatically called <hi>the Truth,</hi> in 2 Theſ. 2.13. —<hi>God hath from the Beginning choſen you to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:005439_0148_10183224572dda68"/>
thro' Sanctification of the Spirit, and Belief of the</hi> TRUTH. Thus the ſame is alſo called, in <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. and 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.1. with many other Places which I need not tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The <hi>next</hi> Thing we have to conſider, is, what we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand by the <hi>Love of the Truth.</hi> Now, to this I ſay, That this Love is ſuch an Approbation and Acquieſcence of the Heart in it, as is ſuitable to the Nature and Excellency of the Things ſuppoſed to be loved. This ſuppoſeth an Aſſent of the Underſtanding to it, as being what it is; and in that Reſpect good, which no Falſhood is. But a Soul that loves the Truth here intended, does not ſtay here, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves of it, and takes Satisfaction in it, as it is divine, proceeding from God, and being worthy of him: And in Reſpect of the Things revealed by it, exceeding excellent; and neceſſary to be known by the Children of Men: And on theſe Accounts he takes Pleaſure in it.</p>
                  <p>A Soul thus loving the Truth, ſavoureth the Things of God, as truly excellent and glorious. He can ſay from the Bottom of his Heart, as in 2 Kings 20.19. <hi>Good is the Word of the Lord</hi>; and as in Rom. 7.22. <hi>I delight in the Law of the Lord after the inward Man</hi>; and as in Pſal. 119.140. <hi>Thy Law is very pure; therefore thy Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant loveth it.</hi> The Precepts, Promiſes, and Threatnings of God's Word are all eſteemed by him, as in Pſal. 119.128. <hi>I eſteem all thy Precepts concerning all Things to be right; and I hate every falſe Way.</hi> A Lover of the Truth is a good and holy Man. He that has the Love of the Truth in his Heart, has the Love and Fear of God alſo in it. In a Word, ſuch an One has a Principle of true Holineſs in his Soul. He has the <hi>Seed of God</hi> in him, as in 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. He has been <hi>made Partaker of the divine Nature,</hi> as in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The <hi>third</hi> Thing to be conſidered, is, what it is to <hi>receive</hi> the Love deſcribed; and ſo what it is <hi>not to receive</hi> it. Now, to this I ſay, That this muſt needs be done by ſome Act or Acts of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſaid to do it; which are required, in order to his having of it, and which it is Man's Duty to perform. It cannot intend only his being made Partaker of it, without doing any Thing in order to it. This does from hence appear to be a Truth, That Men's not receiving the Love of the Truth, is in the Text ſpoken of as the Sin and Crime for which ſuch Offenders eternally periſh. Now, if ſomething were not required of Sinners, in order to their being made Partaker; of it, it could not be charged on them as their Crime, tho' it might be their great Misfortune (if I may be allowed to uſe that Word) that they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:005439_0149_1018322802e99ee8"/>
not of it. God's not beſtowing the Love of the Truth on any Sinner, would not be the Sinner's Fault, if nothing were required of him in orde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> theret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. When not receiving the Love of the Truth, is ſpoken of as the Sin and Crime of thoſe who have it not, this plainly implies, that ſuch as have this Love, have it in the Way of a Gift from another, even from God himſelf, unto which their Act of receiving or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting it is neceſſary. It is not ſaid that Sinners periſh for not lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Truth; but for not receiving that Love: By which we are taught, that it is the Gift of God; inaſmuch as it is to be received from him; and that Sinners have a conditional Offer of it made to them; as will by and by more fully appear.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>fourth</hi> Thing in Order, is, to ſhew that Sinners <hi>might be ſaved,</hi> if they would <hi>receive the Love</hi> ſpoken of. By the Text we are aſſured, that thoſe who periſh, do ſo, becauſe they receive not this Love, that they might be ſaved. In which Words it is plainly inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, that they might and ſhould be ſaved, did not their Refuſal of the Love of the Truth, hinder it: And it accordingly followeth in Verſe 11, 12. That for this Cauſe God ſends ſome <hi>ſtrong Deluſion, that they ſhould believe a Lie: That they all might be damned, who believed not the Truth, but had Pleaſure in Unrighteouſneſs.</hi> In theſe Words, what is called <hi>periſhing,</hi> and oppoſed to Men's being ſaved, is ſignified their being given up to ſuch Unbelief and Hardneſs of Heart, as will end in their eternal Torment.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And <hi>fifthly,</hi> it followeth, (as is above ſuppoſed) that the Reaſon why Men periſh, under the Goſpel, is becauſe they receive not the Love of the Truth. If they would accept of that precious Gift, they ſhould not <hi>periſh, but have everlaſting Life.</hi> Nothing can be more evident than this, in the Place under Conſideration. The main Scope and Deſign of the Place is to aſſert this Truth: Which Truth having now cleared up, I ſhall</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Proceed, to clear up the Conſequence which I draw from the Premiſes: Namely, That it from hence followeth, that a Principle of true Grace or Holineſs is offered to Sinners in the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>It is evident that ſuch a Principle of Holineſs is plainly implied in <hi>the Love of the Truth,</hi> of which I have been ſpeaking: And it is alſo manifeſt, that Men's not receiving (<hi>i. e.</hi> refuſing, or not accepting) of this divine Principle, plainly ſuppoſeth their having, in the Goſpel, an Offer of it made to them; for how is it poſſible, that Perſons ſhould be guilty of a heinous Sin, in not receiving from the Hand of
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:005439_0150_1018328097809de8"/>
Another, a Benefit which they never had any Offer of? And how ſhould their Refuſal of ſuch a Mercy be the Cauſe of their eternal Ruin? If he who alone had the Diſpoſal of it, never declared his Willingneſs to confer the ſame upon them, on any Terms whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; or never propoſed any Condition on which the ſame might be obtained; or never ſaid to Perſons deſtitute of it, as in Rev. 3.18. <hi>I counſel thee to buy of me Gold tried in the Fire, that thou mayſt be rich; and white Raiment, that thou mayſt be cloathed, and that the Shame of thy Nakedneſs do not appear; and anoint thine Eyes with Eye-Salve, that thou mayſt ſee.</hi> Which <hi>Gold, &amp;c.</hi> here ſpoken of, certainly compri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a Principle of true Holineſs in it; and albeit it cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly purchaſed by any Sinner, yet it may, on ſome Terms or other, be attained: And leſs than this, I think, cannot be implied in the Words.</p>
                  <p>Now, if I am aſked what the Terms are, on which this ineſtimable Benefit may be acquired, I need here only ſay, that they are the ſame which I have, in this Eſſay, more than once declared to be the Condition of the new Covenant, or Covenant of Grace; more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially this is done in this ſecond Part, Chap. III. whereunto, for the avoiding of Prolixity, I ſhall here only refer my Reader.</p>

In this preſent Chapter I ſhall conſider that which, with ſome Appearance of Reaſon, may be objected from the Accounts
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:005439_0151_1018322b51228150"/>
we have in Scripture, of the Corruption of Man's Nature ſince the Fall; and his Impotence thence ariſing, with Reſpect to Things ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and truly holy, from whence his Inability, by Nature, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Terms of the new Covenant, is, with a very conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Shew of Reaſon and Piety, by many, endeavoured to be manifeſted; whether with any good Succeſs, and real Strength, with Reſpect to my Hypotheſis, I ſhall now endeavour to weigh in the Ballance of the Sanctuary.</p>
                  <p>But let us a little conſider what may be truly ſaid, with Reſpect to Man's Impotence while he is in a State of Nature: And here, I readily acknowledge, that while he is in that State, he has no Power to perform any Action whatſoever, in a gracious and holy Manner. I conſtantly affirm, that unto the Performance of an Action as is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, it is abſolutely neceſſary that the Perſon performing it, be firſt endowed with a Principle of true Grace and Holineſs, from which ſuch an Action may ſpring or flow. The Tree muſt be good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Fruit can be ſo, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.43, 44, 45.</p>
                  <p>Men in a natural or unregenerate State, may, indeed, perform Actions that are materially good, or in Reſpect of the general Nature and Kind of them, and ſo ſuch Actions as God has commanded them to perform; but they cannot perform them in ſuch a Manner, as will denominate them, in a ſtrict Senſe, good and holy.</p>
                  <p>And it muſt alſo be acknowledged, that Mankind are, by Reaſon of the Corruption of their Nature, ſo <hi>bent</hi> and inclined to do that which is evil, and ſo <hi>diſinclined</hi> and backward to do well, that it is not eaſy for them to do thoſe Things that are materially good, and to forbear the contrary to them; tho' this be not wholly above their Power; for they frequently, while in a State of Nature, do the Good and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from the Bad. I think that in theſe Things I agree with the Generality of thoſe who are Pious and Orthodox.</p>
                  <p>And from what I have now ſaid, I infer, that the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt me and thoſe who miſlike my Hypotheſis, does not lie in this, that I exalt the Power of Men in their natural State, more than they do; but in this rather, that I exalt the Grace of God more: For whereas they affirm, that the Faith and Repentance which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires as the Condition of the Covenant of Grace, is ſuch as none can exerciſe 'till they are become good and holy Perſons, being born of the Spirit, and become new Creatures; I on the contrary endeavour to maintain, that the Faith and Repentance, by God required as the Condition of the new Covenant, is of a lower Kind than thoſe who
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:005439_0152_101832831f3ac040"/>
oppoſe me will allow of; and ſuppoſe it to be ſuch as Men, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Aſſiſtance, can perform, before they are ſavingly renewed by the Spirit, and ſo become true Saints, as all that are <hi>born of God</hi> are, and ſo <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>paſſed from Death to Life,</hi> as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.17. and <hi>John</hi> 5.24. does appear. I really think that God, in the Covenant of Grace, does not inſiſt on ſuch Terms, as my Oppoſers imagine, and which can never be complied with by any Sinner, while he is in his miſerable and undone Eſtate; but then only, when he has got into a State of Safety, and has already obtained eternal Life.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe therefore who would convince me of a Miſtake in this Affair, ſhould anſwer my Arguments, by which I endeavour to prove, That
<q>neither Regeneration, nor any Action implied in it, can be the Condition on which Salvation is offered to Sinners in the Goſpel.</q>
Part II. Chap. V. And they ſhould alſo ſhew, if they can, that ſuch Faith and Repentance, as I hold to be the Condition of the new Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, neither is, nor can be ſo, by a Confutation of what I have ſaid, Part II. Chap. III. and elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>But it may be here ſaid, That by my own Confeſſion, Sinners are required to <hi>come to Jeſus Chriſt for Life,</hi> on Pain of eternal Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; which Coming muſt needs be included in the Condition of the new Covenant, and is ſo, as appears in <hi>John</hi> 6.35, 37. <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. And yet the Coming intended, cannot be in the Power of any Perſon, while in a State of Nature; for our Saviour himſelf tells us, in the ſaid 6th Chapter of <hi>John,</hi> Verſe 44. That <hi>no Man can come to him, except the Father which hath ſent him, draw him:</hi> And in Verſe 65. he ſays, <hi>No Man can come unto me, except it were given him of my Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, to this Objection, I anſwer, (1) By acknowledging that Coming to Jeſus Chriſt for Life, belongs to the Condition of the new Covenant, or rather, is the Condition intended, or Thing required, in order to the Salvation of ſinful Men. (2) By affirming that Perſons in an unregenerate State, may have Power to come to Chriſt for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life. The laſt of theſe only needs to be conſidered: And the Queſtion here is not whether any Man can come to Jeſus Chriſt, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Father draw him and incline his Heart to come; which muſt be denied; but what that Drawing is, which is intended in the Words under Conſideration; and whether none but thoſe that do come to Chriſt, have the Drawing intended.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="138" facs="unknown:005439_0153_1018322ce3fe1c80"/>Thoſe who oppoſe my Hypotheſis, ſuppoſe that that divine <hi>Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> which our Saviour ſpeaks of, conſiſts in that powerful Influence of God on the Souls of Men, whereby there is a ſaving Change wrought in them, in Reſpect whereof they are ſaid to be born of the Spirit; and conſequently that ſuch as have not ſuch a Change wro't in them, have no Power to come to Chriſt. But at preſent I ſee no Reaſon to believe, that the <hi>Drawing</hi> intended by our Lord, means the efficacious, and indeed, irreſiſtable Influence of the holy Spirit, in the great Work of Regeneration. I will offer ſome Reaſons why I think this not to be intended in the Places quoted.</p>
                  <p>And the firſt Reaſon which I ſhall name is, Becauſe when Sinners are invited to come to Chriſt for Life, one Thing intended in the Life which they are to go to Chriſt for, is the Grace of Regeneration, or that Principle of ſpiritual Life which we loſt by the Fall, and which in the Work of Regeneration is reſtored: Or is it not true that Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are called to go to Chriſt for this, which is one of the principal Benefits which he purchaſed for his People, yea even for the very firſt Beginnings of this ſpiritual Life? I hope none will dare to deny this.</p>
                  <p>Now, if Sinners are invited to go to Chriſt for this Principle of Life, or Grace, how can it be poſſibly imagined that their firſt having it is neceſſary in order to their doing it? For muſt they firſt have the Life they ſhould go to Chriſt for, before it is poſſible for them to go to him for it? I cannot yet underſtand this!</p>
                  <p>My ſecond Reaſon is this: The Expreſſion uſed in the Words un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Conſideration, ſeems not well to agree with the Work intended, if by <hi>Drawing,</hi> the Work of Regeneration be meant. The Work of Regeneration is wro't by the immediate Operation of the Spirit; and it is, according to the Language of Scripture, a <hi>creating Work, Pſal.</hi> 51.10. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. And it is compared to that mighty Act of God's Power, by which Jeſus Chriſt was raiſed from the Dead, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19, 20. It is alſo called the giving a <hi>new Heart</hi> and a <hi>new Spirit, Ezek.</hi> 11.19. and 36.26. Now this Work ſeems not to be well expreſſed by the Word <hi>Drawing,</hi> which ſuits better to Perſons being perſuaded in a moral Way, than their having a ſupernatural Work wro't in them by infinite Power. I confeſs the Word <hi>Drawing,</hi> may be uſed in a phyſical Senſe, but then I think it is not with Application to moral or rational Agents, as ſuch, as in the Caſe under Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which concerns Men's being drawn to their Duty, in a Way, no Doubt, agreable to their Natures. To draw a free Agent into Action, is, in a rational Way, to excite him to it; and it is ſuch Drawing that
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:005439_0154_10183284f0d678d0"/>
Men need in order to their coming to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eſus for his ſaving Benefits, whether it be before their Regeneration, or after it: And when they are effectually drawn in this Way, it is <hi>given to them to come to Chriſt,</hi> as in one of the Places quoted, <hi>viz. John</hi> 6.65.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall here add, <hi>thirdly,</hi> That this Word <hi>Draw,</hi> and other Words like it, are uſed in Scripture, in the ſame Senſe I plead for, <hi>i. e.</hi> to perſuade Perſons to what is their Duty and Intereſt, in a moral or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Way: Yea, whether this Courſe have Succeſs or not, Perſons may be ſaid to be drawn, led, or perſuaded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See Hoſea 11.4. <hi>I drew them with Cords of a Man, with Bands of Love, and I was to them as they that take off the Yoke on their Jaws, and I laid Meat unto them.</hi> Rom. 2.4. <hi>The Goodneſs of God leadeth thee unto Repentance.</hi> 2 Cor. 4.11. <hi>Knowing the Terror of the Lord, we perſwade Men.</hi> Acts 26.28. <hi>Almoſt thou perſwadeſt me to be a Chriſtian. Agrippa</hi> was perſuaded, tho' not prevailed with. Perſons may be thus drawn and perſuaded to go to Chriſt, who yet never go to him. When our Saviour ſaid, in John 12.32. <hi>And I, when I am lifted up, will draw all Men unto me,</hi> did not mean, I believe, that he would draw all Men effectually of whom he ſpake. Some he intended ſo to draw as to leave them inexcuſable. See John 15.22. <hi>If I had not come and ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto them, they had not had Sin: But now they have no Cloak for their Sin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tho' it be granted that <hi>no Man can come to the Son, except the Father draw him</hi>: Yet I do not acknowledge, that no Man has Power to come to the Son, except he be drawn effectually, ſo as actually to come to him; much leſs, except he be drawn irreſiſtably, ſo that he cannot but come to him: This is more than to ſay that a Man cannot come to the Son, except the Father draw him. Tho' without drawing, Men cannot come; yet many are drawn who never comé. See Matth. 23.37. <hi>O</hi> Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, <hi>thou that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them that are ſent unto thee; how often would I have gathered thy Children together, even as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings; and ye would not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may, perhaps, be objected againſt what I have here ſaid, That ſuch a Drawing of Perſons as I have been deſcribing, can give no Power to come to Chriſt. Drawing in a Way of moral Suaſion does not give the Perſons drawn any Power which they had not before; tho' it may excite to the Exerciſe of Powers they before had.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="140" facs="unknown:005439_0155_1018323293f80f80"/>To this Objection I anſwer, That Perſons may be ſaid to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to do this, that, or the other Thing, either in a more proper Senſe, when they have no Power latent in them, capable of being ſo excited and ſtirred up by proper Means and Motives, ſuitable for the awakening and exciting ſuch a Power, as Inſtructions, Exhortations, Promiſes and Threatnings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or leſs properly, for ſuch an utter Indiſpoſition to Things propoſed to be done, as renders a Perſon actually uncapable of doing them, without ſome Means uſed with him, for removing the Indiſpoſition unto which he is ſubject. Now I ſuppoſe Men's Inability to come to Chriſt, is of the Kind or Sort firſt named. It conſiſts in the Averſion of their Wills to the Duty propoſed to them, and ariſes from ſeveral Cauſes, ſuch as inherent Corruption, Ignorance, Temptations from without of ſeveral Sorts, a contracted Habit by a long Courſe of evil Doings; of which laſt ſee <hi>Jer.</hi> 2.24. and Chap. 13.23.</p>
                  <p>If Men's Inability to do well be of the latter Sort mentioned, Inſtructions, Exhortations, Reproofs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not in the leaſt ſuited to help and ſtrengthen them. Arguments will give no Power of the Kind needed by the Perſon that has none; and it is wholly in vain to make uſe of any to that End. But if a Perſon's Weakneſs and Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to do well, be of the other Kind mentioned, then Inſtructions, Exhortations, and convincing Arguments, are a proper Remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſuch Weakneſs, and may greatly ſtrengthen the Subjects of it. Means of this Kind, commonly called <hi>moral Suaſion,</hi> can be of no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Uſe than this: Nor are the ſame deſigned by God, for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of ſuper-natural Effects, as the immediate End of them: They only enable Men to exerciſe the Powers they have, but give none to ſuch as are wholly without Strength.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Drawing</hi> by the Father, without which no Man can come to the Son, I take to be of this Kind, as above. I do not think that by <hi>Drawing,</hi> our Lord intends the great Work of Regeneration, for the Reaſons which I have given: And this Kind of Drawing Sinners have who never yet come to the Son, in thoſe Strivings of the Spirit of God with them, which they often reſiſt and quench, of which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, in Chap. XIX.</p>
                  <p>But if the Expoſition I have given of the Texts objected be refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the Senſe of them which I oppoſe be ſtill contended for, let us ſeriouſly conſider the Conſequences which will follow it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="141" facs="unknown:005439_0156_10183289d64b36e0"/>The Deſign then, with which theſe Texts are urged, is, to ſhew that no Man has Power of any Kind, to come to Jeſus Chriſt for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life, but thoſe only, who, being unto that End firſt born of the Spirit, do actually go to him, and are eternally ſaved: So that all others, being wholly without Power to come to the only Saviour of Sinners, do unavoidably continue in that Unbelief, againſt which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Damnation is denounced, <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. They <hi>cannot</hi> come to Chriſt that they may have Life, and this <hi>Cannot,</hi> is not only becauſe they <hi>will not</hi>; but they have no ſuch Power latent in them, which being excited and ſtirred up, they might go to Chriſt for the eternal Salvation of their Souls. The Impoſſibility, therefore, that they are under of going to Jeſus Chriſt for Salvation, is <hi>phyſical,</hi> as to the Kind of it, and not <hi>moral</hi> only; for they muſt have a Work of new Creation wrought in them, before this phyſical Impotence can be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: Nor are they ſuppoſed to have any Offer of this Benefit made to them, on any Condition whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>Now the plain Conſequence of what is thus maintained ſeems to be this, That all that periſh under the Goſpel, do periſh unavoidably, any Means or Advantages they enjoy notwithſtanding. They have no Advantage in their Hands, by the Improvement of which they may make ſure of the Salvation of their Souls: This is not promiſed to them, on any Condition within the Compaſs of their Power; nor is any Strength, by which they may cloſe with Chriſt, ever conferred on them.</p>
                  <p>Now, if the Caſe be really ſuch as has been now expreſſed, I would fain know what Kindneſs (if any at all) is ſhewed to thoſe that fail of Salvation: Or will it be ſaid, That in the Revelation of a Way of Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt, there is no real Favour ſhown to any but thoſe who ſhall eventually be ſaved? May we then tell thoſe to whom we preach the Goſpel, that unleſs they obtain eternal Life, God has ſhown them no real Kindneſs, in all that which has been done, of which we have an Account in the Goſpel? Can we think that the maintaining of this would be to the Honour of divine Grace? For my Part, I cannot think that all that ſeeming Love which God manifeſts to Mankind, in ſending his Son to redeem a ſinful World, and ſetting up a Treaty of Peace among all thoſe to whom the Goſpel is preached, is no Kindneſs to ſuch as are not eventually ſaved. Such an Opinion as this ſeems not to agree with ſuch Texts as theſe which follow, <hi>viz. John</hi> 3.16. 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. and Chap. 4.19. ſo <hi>Luke</hi> 2.10, 11. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19, 20. and many other Places.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="142" facs="unknown:005439_0157_1018323aaf3abe78"/>Nor can I, I confeſs, ſee how any ſhould be obliged to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God for his Goodneſs in ſending his Son to redeem us, and his Goſpel to perſuade us to be reconciled unto him, if he hath ſhewed no real Kindneſs in it. Neither can I underſtand how Men's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences ſhould upbraid them for not doing what they are under a phyſical Impoſſibility of performing, tho' they are bound to confeſs that they are juſtly deprived of that Power to do well, with which, in their moral Head and Repreſentative, they were endowed.</p>
                  <p>As yet I cannot ſee how any Diſhonour can be done to the Name and Grace of God, by our believing and aſſerting, that thoſe who periſh under the Goſpel, do not fall ſhort of eternal Life, becauſe they cannot, but becauſe they will not, come to Jeſus Chriſt for it. On the contrary, I think it is much to the Honour of God and his Grace, that we believe and confeſs, that he does in the Way of the new Covenant, put Sinners, to whom the Grace of that Covenant is offered, on a ſecond Trial, wherein they ſtand Probationers for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Bleſſedneſs, on Terms poſſible for them to perform. But I ſhall conſider what may be objected againſt this.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>OME may think that if, as I aſſert, Sinners have in the Goſpel an Offer of the Grace given in Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, made to them, it will from hence follow, that Grace is given according to Works; which is an Error condemned in the Church of God, in all Ages; and very contrary to the Holy Scriptures, as in 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. I ſhall therefore conſider, whether on this Account there can be any juſt Objection raiſed againſt the Poſition I endeavour to defend. And to this End, I ſhall conſider, (1) What may be intended by Grace in the Objection. (2) What may be meant by its not being given accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Works. (3) Whether, theſe Things being rightly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:005439_0158_1018328c1446df48"/>
the Propoſition oppoſed to my Hypotheſis, does really make any Thing againſt it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us conſider what we may here underſtand by Grace. Now by Grace here, the Grace of God is doubtleſs to be underſtood: And by God's Grace, his undeſerved Favour is moſt properly meant, in which Senſe it being taken, it cannot be obtained by any according to Works: To affirm this would be a plain Contradiction both to itſelf, and to the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 4.4. <hi>To him that worketh is the Reward not reckoned of Grace, but of Debt.</hi> Alſo Rom. 11.6. <hi>If by Grace, then it is no more of Works: Otherwiſe Grace is no more Grace. But if it be of Works, then it is no more Grace: Otherwiſe Work is no more Work.</hi> By that Grace which is in Scripture, and by the Church of God in all Ages, denied to be given according to Works, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the free and undeſerved Favour of God, with all thoſe Benefits which flow from it to his People. Moſt properly the Grace of God ſignifies the undeſerved Favour of God to thoſe whom he has ſet his Love upon; and hence, by a <hi>Metonimy</hi> of the Cauſe for the Effect, the Word Grace is uſed for thoſe Benefits which God of his free Grace beſtows on the Children of Men; eſpecially on thoſe whom he eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſaves. And taken in this Senſe, Grace ſignifies Juſtification and Adoption; and alſo that Principle of Grace which is given in our Regeneration, and all thoſe holy Actions which by his adjutant Grace proceed from it.</p>
                  <p>Now, tho' Grace may be taken in any or all of theſe Senſes, in the Queſtion under Conſideration; yet my preſent Deſign leads me to conſider it as it intends that Principle of Holineſs which God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows on Sinners in their Regeneration; this being that which I ſay is conditionally offered in the Goſpel, and which many deny ſo to be.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Let us conſider what is intended by this Propoſition, That Grace is not given according to Works. And unto this I anſwer, that there are two Things, either or both of which may be intended thereby. (1) That God does not beſtow his Grace on the Children of Men, in the Way, or on the Terms, of the Covenant of Works, wherein perfect and perpetual Obedience to the Law of God was the Condition whereon Life and Happineſs were promiſed to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. God does not now offer or beſtow his Grace on ſuch Terms as theſe. That Covenant has long ſince been broken by all Mankind; and all that Good which was conditionally promiſed in it, utterly and for ever forfeited and loſt. Such as will now adhere to this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, can expect no Good at God's Hands, nothing leſs than the
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:005439_0159_1018323c90199500"/>
Wrath and Curie denounced therein againſt the Breakers of it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. Or, (2) That Grace is not given according to Works, may intend, that it is not given as a juſt Reward of, or for, good Works performed, tho' they are not ſuppoſed to come up to the Terms of the firſt Covenant. Perſons may think that, for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices they perform to God, they deſerve well at his Hand; ſo that it is but a juſt and equal Thing that he ſhould ſave them, tho' they are guilty of many Failings. They may think they carry themſelves ſo well, that God will deal hardly by them, if he grants not his ſpecial Favour to them, and think they well deſerve it. <hi>Wherefore have we faſted,</hi> ſay they, <hi>and thou ſeeſt it not? Wherefore have we afflicted our ſelves, and thou takeſt no Knowledge?</hi> Iſai. 58.3. Obſerve how well the <hi>Phariſee</hi> thought of his Performances, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.10, 11. Perſons that go about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, and obtain God's Favour and Grace on the Account of it, do not always ſuppoſe that they come fully up to the Terms of the Covenant of Works. They have too much Light to think ſo. But, however, they think very much to commend themſelves to God, by their good Performances; and on them they truſt for Acceptance with him, and for all the Grace they hope to receive from him. This ſeems evidently to be the Caſe of thoſe ſpoken of by the great Apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> Rom. 9.31, 32. <hi>But</hi> Iſrael <hi>which followed after the Law of Righteouſneſs hath not attained to the Law of Righteouſneſs. Wherefore? Becauſe they ſought it, not by Faith, but as it were by the Works of the Law.</hi> They did not, indeed, expect to be juſtified, and find Favour with God, by the Works of the Law, or by fully complying with the Tenor of the Law of Works; yet they depended on their own good Works, for the Benefits they needed, and ſo they ſought thoſe Benefits, as it were, by the Deeds of the Law. Compare with this, that in Chap. 10.3. Men oftner miſcarry in this Way, than by thinking that they can come fully up to the Terms of the firſt Covenant. They think to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend themſelves to God by their own Righteouſneſs, tho' they do not think that they can do all that the Covenant of Works required.</p>
                  <p>But the Apoſtle ſhews the Vanity of ſuch Hopes, in the mentioned <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. compared with Verſe 12. and elſewhere. If Grace were given in the Way ſuch as theſe ſeek it, it would be given ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Works. But I acknowledge, that God does not beſtow his Grace upon Sinners in this Way. He grants it not to them on Account of any Goodneſs in them, nor for the Sake of any Works of Righteouſneſs performed by them, as plainly appears in 2 Tim. 1.9. <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy Calling, not according to our Works, but according to his own Purpoſe and Grace which was given
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:005439_0160_10183290ef30cb98"/>
us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the World began.</hi> So again in Tit. 3.5. <hi>Not by Works of Righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his Mercy he ſaved us, by the Waſhing of Regeneration, and Renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Let us conſider whether the objected Propoſition being under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood as now explained, any Thing can be inferred from it againſt the Hypotheſis by me defended. And to this I ſay, I think it will appear there cannot, if we conſider what here followeth.</p>
                  <p>As, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Grace is, on my Hypotheſis, given according to Promiſe, or in the Way of a conditional Covenant, is not equivalent to its being given according to Works, in the Senſe explained. Things may nevertheleſs be freely given, for being given in the Way of a conditional Covenant. Indeed it is not ſo, if the Condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired be a valuable Conſideration, ſuch as deſerves a Reward, or ſome Teſtimony of Gratitude, on the Account of Things required to be done; but very frequently this is not the Caſe, nor is ſo in the Caſe under Conſideration, as I ſhall preſently ſhow.</p>
                  <p>However, If God's beſtowing his Benefits on Men, in the Way of a Covenant, wherein ſomething is required to be done by them, in order to their obtaining of them; and unto the doing whereof a Promiſe is annexed, would infer or imply their obtaining them by their own good Works or Merits, it would from hence follow, That Pardon of Sin and eternal Bleſſedneſs are Benefits given according to Works; for theſe Benefits are certainly obtained in a covenant Way. The Scriptures are plain as to this; and none, that I know of, beſides <hi>Antinomians</hi> deny it. I ſhall only refer to ſome of the Texts in which this is manifeſt: I need not tranſcribe them. See <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37, 38, 39. and Chap. 10.43. and 16.30, 31. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.17, 18.</p>
                  <p>Tho' our Divines many of them deny, that the Grace of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, or of a new Heart, is given in the Way of a conditional Covenant; yet I ſuppoſe there are ſcarce any of them but what own Juſtification, Adoption, and eternal Glory to be thus given: But now, if, becauſe I hold that God gives his Holy Spirit, and the ſaving Graces thereof, in the Way of a conditional Promiſe, it be thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, that, according to my Hypotheſis, it is given according to Works, or according to Men's Merits, I would know if it would not as well follow from the ſame Premiſes, with Relation to the other mentioned Benefits, that they alſo are given according to Works, or the Merits of thoſe on whom they are beſtowed: But as this does not follow from the mentioned Premiſes, ſo neither does the other.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="146" facs="unknown:005439_0161_1018323ed078c430"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Grace of Regeneration cannot, on my Principles, be given according to Works; becauſe, on my Hypotheſis, no Man can perform any good Works, properly and ſtrictly ſo called, 'till after he is regenerate or born again. That Grace may be given according to Works, two Things ſeem neceſſarily required, <hi>viz.</hi> (1) That the Works are really good and holy, with Regard to which the Grace intended is ſuppoſed to be given: For it is not likely that God ſhould give his Grace as a Reward for Works not truly good and holy. (2) That the Works intended be done before the Grace is beſtowed, which is ſuppoſed to be given as a Reward of them: For the Thing for which a Reward is given muſt needs be prior to that which is given as a Reward of it. But I, as well as thoſe with whom I diſpute, am fully of Opinion, that no Man can perform any good Action, (meaning by good what is in a proper and ſtrict Senſe ſo,) 'till after he is <hi>born of the Spirit,</hi> or <hi>created anew unto good Works,</hi> as in <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. with which compare <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27. and <hi>Luke</hi> 6.43, 44, 45. How then ſhould the Grace of Regeneration be given, on my Principles, according to Men's good Works or Merits?</p>
                  <p>If we duly conſider what, according to my Principles, is really re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of Sinners, in order to their obtaining the Grace of Regeneration, it will plainly appear, that Grace is not given to them according to Works. The Condition on which, according to my Opinion, Grace is offered to them, does neither conſiſt in the perfect Obedience which the Covenant of Works required, nor yet in ſuch Holineſs as the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel requireth of regenerate Saints: If it required the laſt of theſe no Perſon could ever be regenerated or born again.</p>
                  <p>But what the Goſpel requires of unregenerate Sinners, to the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned End, compriſes in it ſuch Things as theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> (1) That they acknowledge their Sinfulneſs, both by Nature and Practice, and that they deſerve eternal Damnation. (2) That they acknowledge the Guilt of their many and mighty Sins, and that without the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of them they never can be ſaved. (3) That they are ſenſible of the Corruption of their Natures, and their Need of regenerating Grace. (4) That they believe the good Tidings of that Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt, which is revealed in the Goſpel, and do not deſpair of God's Mercy. (5) That they ſeek earneſtly to God for the Pardon of their Sins, and the regenerating Influences of his Spirit, ſeriouſly waiting on him in the Uſe of thoſe Means which he has directed to, in order to their obtaining theſe Mercies. (6) That they carefully avoid all thoſe ſinful Courſes which tend to provoke him to deny his Holy Spirit, or with-hold the ſame from them. (7) That they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:005439_0162_10183293e10df5b8"/>
in the Way of their Duty, that has now been expreſſed. (8) That they confeſs, that in all this they are unprofitable Servants, and inſtead of doing more than their Duty, they fall infinitely ſhort of it, and ſo are not worthy of the leaſt of God's Mercies, much leſs of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Sin, and the ſaving Graces of God's Spirit here, and eternal Glory hereafter. (9) That they earneſtly plead with God the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of his Mercy, made to ſuch as ſeek him for it; ſuch as we have in <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.7,—11. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.22, 23, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.9,—13. <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.1,—5. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.3.</p>
                  <p>If in this Way Sinners ſeek and obtain the ſaving Graces of God's holy Spirit, they will find no Occaſion of boaſting that they obtained them by Works of Righteouſneſs which they have done, or by the Deſert of their own good Works, and ſo have merited eternal Life at the Hand of God. There is not the leaſt Appearance of any ſuch Thing in the Method propoſed, of Sinners ſeeking Mercy of the Lord; they having Nothing to recommend them to him, or to plead with him, but their own Poverty and Miſery, and the Riches of his Grace and Mercy, and moſt gracious Covenant: All which is nothing like truſting in, and pleading, their own Righteouſneſs. Our ſuppoſing that to our obtaining the Grace of God, our begging God's Mercy, pleading the Merits of his Son, and his Truth and Faithfulneſs to his Covenant, is not, I think, to hold, that Grace is given according to Works, but well conſiſteth with that <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.9. and Rom. 3.27. <hi>Where is Boaſting then? It is excluded. By what Law? Of Works? Nay: But by the Law of Faith.</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. XVIII. That the beſt Actions of the Unregenerate are not properly called Sins, nor uncapable of being Conditions of the Covenant of Grace.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAVE owned and aſſerted in the foregoing Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, That Perſons in an unregenerate State, cannot perform any Actions that are, in a ſtrict Senſe, holy, and as ſuch, well-pleaſing in God's Sight; but I think they carry this too far, who affirm the beſt Actions of the Unregenerate to be properly dono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated Sins, and an Abomination in God's Sight, and accurſed; yea, that <hi>common Grace is Sin and Luſt.</hi> I chuſe not to name the Perſons who expreſs themſelves after this Manner, but can do it, if it be neceſſary for my own Juſtification.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs, if what is to this Effect ſaid by many, be true, it will follow, that nothing that can be done by any Perſon that is not <hi>born of the Spirit,</hi> can be the Condition of the new Covenant, and as ſuch, entitle the Doer of it to eternal Life. I ſhall therefore endeavour to make it appear, that that which is aſſerted, as above, is not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as a Truth, however worthy the Names of the Perſons are who have ſpoken to this Purpoſe. And to this End I ſhall make ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations relating to the Matter under Conſideration; which being put together, will, I think, ſufficiently clear up the Point in Debate.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Firſt,</hi> Even thoſe Actions that are eſteemed materially evil, as being expreſly forbidden by the Law of God, and may on that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     </gap>unt be oppoſed unto ſuch Actions as are ſaid to be materially good; even ſuch Actions as theſe, I ſay, have ſomething that is good in them. It is generally acknowledged that theſe Actions, conſidered in the phyſical Entity of them, are good Things; and that they are only evil, conſidered in reſpect of the Relation they bear to the divine Law, which they are a Tranſgreſſion of; ſo that tho' ſuch Actions cannot be performed without the Commiſſion of Sin in the doing of them, being ſo forbidden; yet there is a Diſtinction to be made betwixt the Actions themſelves, conſidered only as Actions, or in reſpect of the
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:005439_0164_10183298d39e2010"/>
Subſtance of them, and conſidered with Reſpect to the Obliquity of the ſame Actions, as they have a Relation to the Law of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they are forbidden to the Perſons who ſin in doing them. Such Actions therefore, ſeem more properly called <hi>ſinful,</hi> than <hi>Sin</hi> in the Abſtract; becauſe the <hi>former</hi> diſtinguiſheth betwixt the Act itſelf, and the Vitioſity of it, whereas the <hi>latter</hi> does not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is a great Difference betwixt ſuch forbidden Actions and ſuch as are not forbidden, but may either lawfully be done or let alone: And it ſeems not very proper to call thoſe Actions Sins, which God has no where forbidden. It is readily granted, that Perſons may ſin greatly in the Performance of ſuch, <hi>viz.</hi> either in the Manner how, or End for which they do them; but not in doing the Thing done by them. When therefore it is ſaid, That <hi>the Ploughing of the Wicked is Sin</hi>; this muſt not be underſtood as if their ſo doing was Sin in the Abſtract; but the Meaning is, That the Wicked ſin in their Ploughing, <hi>i. e.</hi> that their is Sin cleaving to this Action of their's, tho' it be in itſelf no Sin: And thus I acknowledge, that there is Sin cleaving to the beſt Actions of the beſt Men, <hi>Eccle.</hi> 7.20. But more abundantly to the Actions of the Unregenerate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly</hi> There is a ſtill greater Difference between the forbidden Actions of the Unregenerate, and thoſe which they do, being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to perform them. For Inſtance: God forbids them to take his Name in vain, but requires them to call on him. Their doing the firſt of theſe is no doubt a great Sin: But is their calling on him a Sin too? Or is their doing it their Sin? I think not. It may indeed be truly ſaid, that they ſin in not doing it as they ought. But this may be truly ſaid of the Actions of the Regenerate alſo, tho' the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate fail much more in this Reſpect. I think there is a great Difference betwixt ſaying, all the Prayers of the Unregenerate have Sin in them, and ſaying they are all of them Sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There is a great deal of Difference between ſuch Actions as have ſome poſitive Wickedneſs committed in the Performance of them, and ſuch as are only negatively faulty, inaſmuch as they want ſome good Qualifications which they have not: As ſuppoſe one Man performs a materially good Action, out of ſome wicked and malicious End, as out of Hatred to God or his Neighbour; but Another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms the ſame Action, or another like it, not out of any ſuch wicked Deſign, but yet without any true Love to God and his Neighbour: Are theſe both alike properly called Sins? Or are they both wicked
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:005439_0165_10183245375cca60"/>
Actions? One of them ſeems to be ſo, indeed, being done for a wicked End; but what of Wickedneſs is there in the other, tho' it would have been much better had there been ſome other Kind of Goodneſs in it, which it had not? The Perſon that does it is, indeed, to blame; but this is becauſe he omitted ſomething which ſhould have been done; not becauſe what he did had any Evil in it. The Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction I have inſiſted on, ſeems evidently countenanced by that Text, <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.27. according to that Tranſlation of the Words, which I chuſe, and Mr. POOL ſeems beſt to approve, <hi>viz. The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of the Wicked is an Abomination,</hi> becauſe <hi>he bringeth it with a wicked Mind.</hi> Thus the latter Part of the Verſe, gives the Reaſon of what is affirmed in the firſt Part of it; for according to this Reading of the Words, they are accounted Wicked, who bring their Offerings with wicked Minds and Intentions; and the Reaſon of God's abhorring them is, their being offered in ſuch a Manner, or for ſuch Ends. Nor is there any Reaſon to think that by the Wicked in this Place and others like it, all unregenerate Perſons are intended; but ſuch as are meant in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.16. not thoſe that are called <hi>Righteous</hi> in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24, 26. and ſeveral other Places, tho' Unregenerate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Many of the Actions of the Unregenerate are not only good, as above, but are performed from good Principles and for good Ends. When an unregenerate Perſon feeds the Hungary, and clothes the Naked, out of natural Compaſſion which he has towards them, it muſt be acknowledged that this is a good Principle. It is not indeed true Grace or Holineſs, neither is it from a corrupt and wicked Principle, or from <hi>Sin that dwelleth in him.</hi> It is really from Grace, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Grace of Nature, or ſome Remainder of the natural Image of God, left in Man after his Fall, which is good, tho' it is not Goodneſs of the beſt Kind. It is no Part of the Image of God loſt by the Fall, and reſtored in our Regeneration, nor does our Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration eradicate, but ſanctify it. So unregenerate Perſons perform ſome Actions for good Ends; as when they labour with their Hands that they may get their Bread honeſtly, and not ſteal from and rob Others to get it. So when an unregenerate Perſon reads the Word of God, hears it preached, and meditates on it, and calls on the Lord, to the End that he may eſcape Damnation, and obtain the great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation offered in the Goſpel; theſe are good Ends, ſuch as God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth him to aim at in the Performance of ſuch Duties. If a Man labours to obtain his own Happineſs, this, indeed, is not the higheſt End of all, which is the Glory of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. And even this an unregenerate Perſon may aim at in what he does, tho' not ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately,
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:005439_0166_1018329c47537530"/>
as what he chiefly intends. Nor ought regenerate Perſons to ceaſe to aim at the Salvation of their own Souls, in what they do, after they can a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> at a higher End than this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Many of the materially good Actions which unregenerate Perſons perform, are the Effects of the Grace of God, in and upon them; and therefore, I think, not Sins. I cannot think that Actions which Men perform by the Help and Influence of the Word and Spirit of God, are well called Sins. God may be truly ſaid to be the Author of ſuch Actions: It is he, of his Grace, who ſtirs up and excites poor ſinful Creatures to perform the Actions I ſpeak of. He enables and excites them to hear, read, meditate, and pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and he is the Author of ſuch Faith as they have, who believe ſometimes only for a while, as in <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. Or may it not be granted, that ſuch Faith, Repentance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the beſt, of which unregenerate Perſons are ſometimes the Subjects, are Effects of the Grace of God, wrought by God's Word and Spirit in their Souls, and frequently called <hi>common Grace?</hi> And are they, this notwithſtanding, all Sin, and an Abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in God's Sight, and, as ſome ſay, contrary to ſaving Grace? I conſtantly maintain, that there is a <hi>ſpecifical</hi> Difference betwixt common Grace, and that which is ſpecial; but I ſee no Reaſon to oppoſe them one to the other, as <hi>Contraries</hi> are oppoſed. Whether by common Grace we intend thoſe gracious Influences of God's holy Spirit, with which the Unregenerate are ſometimes ſavoured, or the good Effects produced in them by theſe gracious Operations, I am not, for my Part, willing to allow them to be Sin.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> I think what is ſaid by that learned Man, Dr. OWEN, in his <hi>Perſeverance of the Saints,</hi> Chap. I. Sect. 17. much favours what I have in this Chapter aſſerted.
<q>Of thoſe who are ſaid to believe and to be holy <hi>really,</hi> and in the Truth of the Thing it ſelf; there are two Sorts. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Such as having received ſundry common Gift<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

On ſuch as theſe there is a <hi>lower</hi> (and in ſome a <hi>ſubordinate</hi>) Work of the Spirit, effectually produci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

is <hi>true, good,</hi> and <hi>uſeful</hi> in it ſelf, anſwering in ſome Likeneſs and Suitableneſs of Operation unto the great Work of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> which faileth not. There is in them <hi>Light, Love, Joy, Faith, Zeal, Obedience,</hi> &amp;c. all true in their Kind, which make many of them in whom they are, do worthily in their Generation, howbeit they attain not to the Faith of God's Elect, neither doth Chriſt live in them, nor is the Life which they lead, by the Faith of the Son of God: As ſhall hereafter be fully declared.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I now appeal to ſuch as are judicious, whether the beſt Actions of the Unregenerate are properly their Sins: If they be not, then we cannot from a falſe Propoſition prove, that none of them can be, by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of God, appointed to be Conditions of the new Covenant.</p>
                  <p>I think it plainly appears, from what has been above ſaid, That the beſt Actions of the Unregenerate, have not more of moral Evil than of moral Goodneſs in them; I therefore do not believe any Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that can be drawn from a Suppoſition hereof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eighthly,</hi> If the beſt Actions of the Unregenerate be truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Sins, I ſee no Reaſon at preſent, but that it were better that they were let alone, than done. If it be ſaid, that tho' the doing of them be Sin, yet it is a greater Sin to omit them; I anſwer, that if they are properly Sins, I know not of any Rule Men have, of two Sins to chuſe the leaſt: I believe that neither the one nor the other ought to be choſen, but that both ought to be abhorred. Indeed, of two Things where one is leſs good than the other, if both cannot be done, the beſt ought to be made choice of; but where both the Things in Queſtion are properly Sins, this is not the Caſe.</p>
                  <p>But I believe that if the beſt Actions (if I may ſo ſpeak) of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate were really Sins, all the Regenerate would be obliged to repent of all they did before their Regeneration, &amp; in order to it, as their Reading, Hearing, Meditating, Praying for converting Grace, Giving Alms, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I confeſs they ought to repent that they performed theſe Things in no better a Manner than they did; but not that they did them at all, tho' they did them not in ſuch a Manner as the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate only can perform Actions that are good in Reſpect of the Matter, or general Nature of them.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. XIX. The Doctrine I plead for, no ways inconſiſtent with that of Predeſtination, and the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Freedom of the Grace of <hi>GOD</hi> in the Salvation of his Elect.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> FREELY acknowledge that it is implied in the Doctrine I plead for, That Sinners who periſh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, do not periſh for want of Power to comply with the Terms of the new Covenant: That they fail of the Grace of God, or fall ſhort of eternal Life, is (according to my Principles) not becauſe the Condition of the Covenant of Grace is ſuch, that thoſe who are not ſaved, have no Power to perform it; but becauſe they <hi>will not</hi> do ſo, John 5.40. <hi>And ye will not come to me that ye might have Life,</hi> And Matth. 23.37. <hi>O</hi> Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, <hi>thou that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them which are ſent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy Children together, even as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings, and ye would not!</hi> Indeed I cannot ſee how the new Covenant could be fitly called the Covenant of Grace, if the Condition of it were ſo very difficult, that all that fall ſhort of the Good of it, might truly plead, That it never was in their Power to comply with the Terms on which Salvation is offered to them in it: But that under all the ſeeming Advantages of the Goſpel which they have enjoyed, their eternal Damnation has been, as to any Thing they could do, utterly unavoidable. Indeed I cannot think this to be the Truth of Man's Caſe, while he enjoys the Grace of God granted to him, in and with the Goſpel, as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1.</p>
                  <p>Now, whether the Doctrine of <hi>Predeſtination,</hi> and of the free and ſovereign Grace of God, manifeſted in the Converſion and eternal Salvation of Sinners, be at all inconſiſtent with the Opinion I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, is what, in this Chapter, is to be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>It is then, or may be here ſaid, that if a ſinful Man hath ſuch a Power as is here ſuppoſed, it will from hence follow, That his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot depend on God's ſovereign Grace: For if Grace and
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:005439_0169_1018324900b2fc50"/>
Salvation be offered and promiſed, on a Condition which Man has Power to perform, or not to perform, then it is in his own Power to determine this Point, whether he ſhall be ſaved, or not; and ſo his Salvation cannot depend on divine Sovereignty, but on his own free Will, which is contrary to the Doctrine of orthodox Proteſtants, who conſtantly maintain the Sovereignty of God with Relation to Man's Salvation; which is alſo agreeable to that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 9.11. and onwards, where he ſheweth at large, that <hi>God hath Mercy and Compaſſion on whom he will</hi>; and he concludeth from it in Verſe 19. that <hi>it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth Mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, this Objection hath great Appearance of Strength in it; and I know of Nothing that ſeems to make more againſt the Doctrine I plead for, than this does: I ſhall therefore endeavour to give it a juſt and impartial Conſideration, in the Particulars which here follow.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As I have formerly ſaid, ſo I ſay now, that I am fully perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Truth of the Doctrine of God's Decrees of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation,</hi> as the ſame is revealed in Scripture; and for the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as it is explained in our <hi>Confeſſions of Faith</hi> and <hi>Catechiſms,</hi> and by our orthodox Divines, ſuch as Dr. TWISSE, Dr. OWEN, Mr. NORTON, Dr. MATHER, Mr. WILLARD, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I hold God's Decree to be abſolute, eternal and unchangeable; and that he has choſen a definite Number of Perſons to Salvation, whoſe Names are all written in the Book of Life, paſſing by and not chuſing <hi>the Reſt,</hi> as they are called <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7. and that all, and only thoſe that are ſo choſen ſhall be eternally ſaved.</p>

I am perſuaded, that in chuſing a Number of Mankind to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and in paſſing by the Reſt, God acted in a Way of abſolute Sovereignty, doing therein according to his own good Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, not being moved by any Cauſes or Motives out of himſelf, as by any Excellency in One more than in Another, or by any Faith or good Works foreſeen, or by any Wickedneſs foreſeen in them that are not choſen.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I have no Doubt but that God acts as an abſolute Sovereign, in the Execution of his Decrees, as well as in willing the Events de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by him, <hi>doing as he will in the Armies of Heaven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth,</hi> Dan. 4.35.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I am accordingly well ſatisfied, that the future and eternal State of Mankind, whether of Weal or Woe, dependeth on the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of God, who <hi>hath Mercy on whom he will,</hi> as is above declared from <hi>Rom.</hi> Chap. 9.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="155" facs="unknown:005439_0170_1018329fadf8a188"/>But the <hi>great Queſtion</hi> here is, Whether all this being granted and received for Truth, the Inference or Conſequence drawn from it in the Objection, that then it cannot be in the Power of thoſe to whom Grace and Salvation is offered in the Goſpel, either to accept the ſame, on the Condition on which it is offered, or not to accept it, refuſing ſo to do, when the Conſequence depending on their doing or not doing it, is, according to the Tenor of the new Covenant, either their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or Damnation? As in <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. This, I ſay, is what I conceive to be the <hi>great Queſtion</hi> here, and I am content that a due Reſolution of this ſhould decide the main Queſtion, which in this Diſcourſe, I have under Conſideration.</p>
                  <p>Now the turning Point here is, Whether the Liberty of reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable Creatures, in their Actions, will not conſiſt with the Decree and governing Providence of God, in ordering all Events according to his own Pleaſure? Or in the Language of Scripture, in <hi>Working all Things after the Counſel of his own Will?</hi> Eph. 1.11. For if God's decreeing future Events, does not take away the Liberty of ſubordinate Agents, concerned in the Execution of his Purpoſes, or their Power of doing or not doing what is done by them, why may not he that believes and is ſaved be ſuppoſed at the ſame Time to have had Power, his Election notwithſtanding, not to have believed: And on the other Hand, he that does not believe, and ſo periſheth, to have or to have had Power to believe, tho' he did not, and tho' this were according to God's Decree. The Decree does not take away this Power, or rather is not inconſiſtent with it. However this may ſeem a Paradox to many; a Creature may have Power to perform an Action which God has decreed he ſhall not do. This will appear if the Manner of his decreeing what free Agents ſhall do or not do, be duly conſidered and underſtood.</p>
                  <p>A little to clear up this Point, I ſhall (1) Shew the pernicious Conſequences that will follow upon denying it. (2) Produce ſome Authorities for it. (3) Eſſay briefly to ſhew the ſame to be in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon poſſible.</p>
                  <p>Now for the <hi>Firſt,</hi> If God's decreeing that his reaſonable Creatures ſhall do, or not do, this or that Action, be inconſiſtent with a Power or Liberty in them to do the contrary, then it will follow, either that he has not decreed all their Actions, and does not by his Providence order and bring about all thoſe Things which are done by them: Or otherwiſe, they having no Liberty reſpecting thoſe Things or Events which God has decreed ſhall exiſt, or come to paſs by their Means,
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:005439_0171_1018324f1d62feb8"/>
they are under an inevitable Neceſſity of doing whatever Actions are done by them, and have no more Liberty than a Clock or Watch has, that is moved by the Weights and Springs that are the irreſiſtable Cauſe of its Motion: And ſo <hi>Hobbs,</hi> who aſſerted the Neceſſity of all Things, was in the Right. The Conſequence of the firſt Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, That God does not govern the World, but in ſome of the moſt important Concernments of it, lets Things run at Random, according to the Pleaſure of fickle and unſteady Agents, contrary to <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11. and many other Texts of Scripture that might be alledged. But otherwiſe, according to the other Hypotheſis, Creatures having no Power to govern their own Wills and Actions, are moſt certainly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of being govern'd in a moral Way, by Laws with Sanctions annexed to them, <hi>i. e.</hi> Rewards promiſed in Caſe of Obedience, and Puniſhments threatned in Caſe of Diſobedience: For why ſhould a Creature be rewarded with Good, or puniſhed with Evil, if he has no more Liberty with Reſpect to what he does, than a Stone has not to fall, when it is toſſed up into the Air? If the Caſe be ſo, how ſhould Men's Conſciences accuſe them, either for doing what they do, or omitting what they do not, which is one great Part of the Puniſhment of their Sins. The Conſequences of both theſe Suppoſitions are intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; therefore neither of the Hypotheſes are to be allowed.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Learned Men avouch, that God's Decrees reſpecting future Events, are conſiſtent with the Liberty of free Agents, with Relation to what they do in effecting them. Thus that learned and judicious <hi>Aſſembly of Divines</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> affirm, in their <hi>Confeſſion,</hi> Chap. 3. Sect. 1. That
<q>tho' God from all Eternity did, by the moſt wiſe and holy Counſel of his own Will, freely and unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ordain whatſoever comes to paſs; yet ſo (ſay they) as thereby neither is God the Author of Sin, nor is Violence offered to the Will of the Creature, nor is the Liberty or Contingency of ſecond Cauſes taken away, but rather eſtabliſhed.</q>
To this Effect alſo Dr. TWISSE, in his <hi>Treatiſe of Reprobation,</hi> in Anſwer to <hi>Hord</hi> and <hi>Maſon,</hi> Part 2. Page 63. ſays, That
<q>whereas we ſee ſome Things come to paſs neceſſarily, ſome contingently; ſo God hath ordained that all Things ſhall come to paſs; but neceſſary Things, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, contingent Things, contingently, that is avoidably, and with a Poſſibility of not coming to paſs: For every Univerſity Scholar knows this to be the Notion of Contingency.</q>
Thus alſo our Mr. NORTON, in his <hi>Orthodox Evangeliſt,</hi> Page 76. ſays,
<q>Man acts as freely as if there were no Decree, yet as infallibly as if there
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:005439_0172_101832a34b1835c0"/>
were no Liberty. Liberty is the Effect of the Decree; ſo far is the Decree from being a Prejudice to Liberty.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why ſhould I quote any other ſuch Paſſages? All that are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Writings of <hi>Calviniſts</hi> know that in this Point they are generally agreed; ſo that I am not ſingular with Reſpect to this Article.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe I am not willing to content my ſelf with telling my Reader, that there are great Abſurdities that follow the Denial of this, and that there are many that affirm it, and think they are bound ſo to do, how difficult ſoever it be to conceive of the <hi>Modus</hi> thereof; for this Reaſon, I ſay, I ſhall not content my ſelf to reſt here, without endeavouring to ſay ſomething briefly, for the clearing up of this Point, and ſhewing the Poſſibility of the Thing aſſerted. And here I ſay,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it ſeems evident, that it is impoſſible that any Thing ſhould come to paſs, God in no Senſe willing it. This, I think, follows as an undeniable Conſequence from this Truth, That his Knowledge and Power are infinite, which I take for granted. As I cannot ſee how it is poſſible that any Thing ſhould come to paſs, without the Knowledge of him, whoſe Underſtanding is infinite, and unlimited, ſo I can no more conceive how any Thing can come to paſs without the Will of him whoſe Power is infinite, he knowing it at the Time when it was done, or about to be done: For ſuppoſe it was not done or brought to paſs by his own Efficiency, either immediate, or thro' the Inſtrumentality of ſome other Agents; yet at leaſt he could have hindred it by his mighty Power, which he would moſt certainly have done, had he not willed its coming to paſs, at leaſt by his <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive</hi> Will. Now the Will of God that this or that Thing ſhall come to paſs, is what I underſtand by the Decree.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Suppoſe it be granted, that God decrees ſome Things by a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive Decree</hi> only; and his Providence with Reſpect to this Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment be correſpondent with ſuch a Decree as that is; yet it muſt be here obſerved, that <hi>Permiſſion</hi> in God muſt not be looked upon as merely the not hindring an Event of which we may have an Idea in our Minds; for God does Nothing to hinder the Being of Millions of Worlds, which neither now exiſt, or ever ſhall: But how abſurd would it be to ſay, on this Account, he permits their Being. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion in God therefore intends his not hindring Things from coming to paſs, which he knows will come to paſs, unleſs he hinders them. And thus divine Permiſſion ſuppoſeth God's doing more towards this
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:005439_0173_10183252610dcac0"/>
or that Thing's coming to paſs, than barely permitting it in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner now expreſſed.</p>
                  <p>For, 3. He muſt at leaſt be ſuch a Cauſe of it, as without which ſuch a Thing could not come to paſs, inaſmuch as it never could have come to paſs, had he not done ſeveral Things that were abſolutely neceſſary in order thereunto; as his making the Agents acting, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them Power to act, and exhibiting the Objects about which the Act is converſant, and providentially ordering the Occaſions leading to it, and giving that Aid to the Agents, without which they could not do what is done by them: <hi>For in him we live, move and have our Being,</hi> Acts 17.28. Now all this ſuppoſeth that God hath from Eternity decreed thus to do: For whatever God does in Time, he decreed to do from Eternity; and this is much more than barely not hindring a free Agent from doing this or that Act.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. From God's permitting free Agents thus to act, the Things in this Way brought to paſs, will as certainly have a Being as if God decreed to bring them about by a poſitive Act of his Power. For if he himſelf does, or decrees to do all that is neceſſary in order to their Futurition, giving his Creatures all the Power and Aid that is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereunto, adminiſtring alſo the Occaſions leading to ſuch Actions or Events, when he knows that his Creatures being put into ſuch a State, and then left to their own free Will, will aſſuredly act after ſuch a Manner; he does by Conſequence will or decree ſuch Actions or Events, as they, not he, are the immediate Efficients and formal Cauſes of. I ſay, he that wills to do that on which he certainly knows ſuch an Event will follow, does by Conſequence will that Event, tho' he himſelf neither does the Thing, nor is properly the Cauſe of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doing it; and tho' the Agent by whom ſuch an Action is done, or ſuch an Effect produced, be at perfect Liberty whether he will do ſo or not. In this Caſe the Event will aſſuredly happen, or the Effect be produced, as if the Agent acting had no Liberty; becauſe God has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to do, and actually does, that which he knows will be an Occaſion (not Cauſe) of that Agent's ſo acting.</p>
                  <p>The certain Futurition of any Events thus neceſſarily, or rather certainly, conſequent on God's permiſſive Decree, relating to them, does not at all infer a Want of Power or Liberty in the Agents imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately concerned in them, of not acting as they do. If God decrees to do that, on which he knows ſuch an Event will follow, that is, That his Creature having Power ſo to act, will of its own Accord do
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:005439_0174_101832a61aa73630"/>
ſo, the Conſequence of this is not, that his Creature has not Power to do otherwiſe. I think this is as plain as any Thing can be. How ſhould God's Decree to ſuffer a free Agent to act after ſuch a Manner, infer that Agent's not having Power to forbear ſo acting?</p>
                  <p>If it be here ſaid, that it is not poſſible that even God himſelf ſhould know what a free Agent will do in a Caſe wherein he is ſuppoſed to have Power to do a Thing or not to do it; I anſwer, <hi>firſt,</hi> By aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him that ſays ſo, How he knows this? Does he find any ſuch Thing aſſerted in the holy Scriptures? Or will he ſay, That a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of God's knowing what a free Agent will do, implies a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, and ſo cannot be true. If this be what is intended, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare my ſelf very far from ſeeing it to be evident. If a Creature may be ſuppoſed to have Power to do that which he does not; or on the other Hand, not to do that which he does; How does it appear that God, whoſe Underſtanding is infinite, cannot know whether he will do the Thing or not do it? To ſuppoſe, that God may know both that ſuch a Creature will do ſuch an Action, and that he will not do it, would indeed be a plain Contradiction: The Reaſon is, becauſe both theſe cannot be true: But to ſuppoſe that God may know that ſuch a Creature will do ſuch an Action, tho' that Creature have Power not to do it, when it is a Truth that he will do it, even then when God is ſuppoſed to know it, has not, I think, any Appearance of a Contradiction in it.</p>
                  <p>It was always <hi>a Truth,</hi> even from Eternity, that Creatures by whom ſuch and ſuch Actions are done in Time, would ſo do them. If it be true a Minute before a Creature performs an Action, that he will perform it; the ſame was true an Hour before that, and a Year before that and ſo from Eternity: Or did this at any Time begin to be a <hi>Truth?</hi> Now, how can any Man affirm, that there may be a <hi>Truth</hi> which God may be, nay, muſt needs be ignorant of? Let it alſo be conſidered, that if God cannot foreknow ſuch Contingencies, then he cannot know of them one Hour before they come to paſs. but thus to diſpute is to argue againſt plain Fact: For it is certain that God hath both fore-known and revealed many ſuch Things long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Accompliſhment; as that of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his ſending the <hi>Jews</hi> back to their own Land; and that of <hi>Judas</hi>'s betraying his Lord and Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or had not theſe Agents Power to forbear doing theſe Actions? I can ſhew that Dr. TWISSE, who was no <hi>Arminian,</hi> affirms this with Reſpect to <hi>Judas,</hi> and ſays the ſame with Reſpect to Men's ſinful Actions in general; yet he truly acknowledgeth that Men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:005439_0175_1018325487ab8040"/>
exerciſe Grace in their doing good Actions, or in their forbearing evil ones, till God beſtows his Grace upon them.</p>
                  <p>I think it appears plainly enough, by what has been ſaid in ſeveral of the laſt foregoing Paragraphs, That the Sovereignty of God in decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing future Events, and bringing them to paſs in the Way of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, is no Ways inconſiſtent with the Liberty of his Creatures.</p>
                  <p>And this I think well agreeth with the <hi>Aſſembly of Divines,</hi> in their <hi>Confeſſion of Faith,</hi> Chap. 5. Sect. 2.
<q>Altho' in Relation to the Fore-knowledge and Decree of God, the firſt Cauſe, all Things come to paſs immutably, and infallibly; yet by the ſame Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence he ordereth them to fall out according to the Nature of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Cauſes, either neceſſarily, freely or contingently.</q>
Now this undoubtedly holds true with Reſpect to God's Decree and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence relating to Man's eternal State, as well as with any other Thing whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>I crave Leave in this Place to make a ſhort Digreſſion from what is the proper Deſign and Buſineſs of this Eſſay, which is not to defend thoſe <hi>calvinian</hi> Doctrines which I acknowledge, but to eſtabliſh my own Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, in thoſe Articles, wherein I differ from moſt that are in that Scheme.</p>
                  <p>But having in Page 154. acknowledged the Truth of the Doctrine of <hi>Reprobation,</hi> as well as that of <hi>Election</hi>; and being ſenſible how very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der many ſerious Souls are, with Reſpect to the firſt mentioned of theſe two Articles; I ſhall attempt in a very few Words, to take off the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Harſhneſs of the Doctrine which I have now named. But let thoſe who own the Doctrine of Election, as it is aſſerted in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4.5. and Verſe 11. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. and many other Places: Let ſuch, I ſay, as believe this Doctrine, conſider how this can be true, and the other mentioned be falſe. How can we ſuppoſe it to be a Truth, that God chuſeth ſome of Mankind to eternal Life, and yet not leave the Reſt unchoſen? How can he be ſaid to chuſe any, if he makes no Difference, but takes all? Now, if we acknowledge that God chuſeth ſome of Mankind from among the Reſt, to be the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his ſpecial Favour, as in the Texts above quoted, this with what is plainly implied in it, and evidently held forth from it, contains the Subſtance of what they hold, if I do not miſunderſtand them who maintain the Doctrine of which I am now ſpeaking: And I deſire ſuch as are willing to ſubmit to the Authority of God's holy Word, to conſider whether as much as this is not plainly held forth in ſuch Texts of Scripture as theſe, <hi>viz. Jude</hi> ver. 4. <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.7, 8. and Chap. 9.21, 22. Many ſuch Texts might be eaſily named.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="161" facs="unknown:005439_0176_101832a7dbe9e790"/>And let it be conſidered that if God does, or ever will, inflict eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Torment on any of the Children of Men, he muſt be ſuppoſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to have intended to do ſo; for we cannot ſuppoſe that God ever did any Thing but what he firſt purpoſed or intended to do; nor can we reaſonably think, that God ever purpoſed or intended to do any Thing, which he did not before purpoſe. Or can we think that any new Reaſons can offer themſelves to God, which before he knew not of, to move him to purpoſe or decree Things which he never before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to do, or intended ſhould be done? I hope none have ſo mean Tho'ts of God, as ſuch an Imagination would imply! I ſuppoſe it undeniable, that whatever God does in Time, he hath purpoſed to do from Eternity.</p>
                  <p>For the ſame Reaſon that God does any Thing in Time, that is done by him, he always purpoſed to do it. If therefore, God inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pain or Torment on any of the Children of Men, he inflicteth the ſame for their Sins; then he eternally purpoſing to inflict Pain or Torment on them, and always purpoſed to do this for their Sins, or as a Juſt Puniſhment of them.</p>
                  <p>But if any think it will from hence follow, that Men's Sins are the Cauſe of God's Decree to puniſh them, they are herein groſly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken: Sin is the Cauſe of Man's ſuffering, and the Thing for which God intends he ſhall ſuffer; yet the ſame cannot be the Cauſe of God's Act in decreeing: The Reaſon of which is evident, <hi>viz.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Decree of God, being an eternal and immunent Act of his, cannot be an Effect of any Thing out of himſelf; and moſt evidently it cannot be an Effect of any Thing that is temporal, as Sin is: For how ſhould a Thing that had no Being till very lately, be the Cauſe of a Thing that had a Being from Eternity. Of God's Actions of this Kind, the Perfections of his own Nature, ſuch as his own perfect Knowledge, Wiſdom, Juſtice, Holineſs, which belong to his eternal Power and God-head, can only be the Cauſe, not the temporary Actions of his Creatures.</p>
                  <p>What God may juſtly do in Time, he may juſtly decree to do from Eternity. If God does nothing in the Execution of his Decrees, which is unjuſt, he does no Injuſtice in decreeing: Or can we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that God does unjuſtly in decreeing to do juſtly? This would be ſtrange! Indeed God's eternal Decree does not of itſelf any Ways af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect any of his Creatures. His Decree does not of itſelf either give them a Being, or work any Effects on them. This is only done by his Efficiency and Providence. If therefore, in and by theſe, he does

his Creatures no Wrong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he never does them any at all. If God deals fairly by his Creatures in all his Works, or providential Diſpenſations towards them, they ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> have no Reaſon to complain of him as if <hi>his Way was not equal.</hi> When therefore God juſtifies himſelf againſt all the hard Thoughts and wicked Cavils of ſinful Men, the Courſe he takes is to ſhew the Juſtice and Equity of all his Actions towards them, and is not wont to diſpute with them concerning his eternal Decrees. See theſe following Texts and others like them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.25,—29. <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.33,—36. <hi>Job</hi> 34.11, 12, 23, 24.</p>
                  <p>Tho' it be true, that God does nothing but what he firſt decrees to do, and this even from Eternity; and as true that God decrees to do nothing but what he does, and that in the very ſame Manner in which he decreed to do it; yet no Inſtances can be given of God's doing any Thing that is unjuſt or unequal in the Execution of his Decrees. He manages all Things in ſuch a Manner, that Man has not the leaſt Reaſon to complain of him. That is moſt true concerning him, in Deut. 32.4, <hi>He is the Rock, his Work is perfect: For all his Wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>As God neither will, nor ever deſigned to torment Men in another Life, ſave for their Sins, whereby they well deſerve the ſame; ſo he never is, nor intended to be, the Cauſe of thoſe Sins for which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to puniſh thoſe who he ever knew would deſerve it. If God ſhould himſelf cauſe Men to commit Sin, it would not ſtand with his Juſtice to puniſh them for it. But no Man can prove, that God was ever the Author of any Sin. To affirm he ever was, is to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme his holy Name. If any have let fall Expreſſions implying that God is the Author of Sin, they have certainly erred therein: And they who accuſe Men with this (as I think, is frequent) when they are not guilty of it, are guilty of grievouſly wronging them.</p>
                  <p>They who affirm, That God has from Eternity <hi>decreed</hi> to <hi>permit</hi> thoſe Sins to be committed, which he certainly knew would be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, if he prevented them not, and that he accordingly does per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them, do not hereby make him the <hi>Author</hi> of Sin. God's ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Creatures to Sin, when it is in his Power to hinder them, is not to be the Author of Sin. No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="164" facs="unknown:005439_0179_1018325e6deb6ab8"/>
in 1 Theſ. 5.17. <hi>Quench not the Spirit,</hi> implies in it the Truth here taken for granted; and there are a great Number of other Texts in which the ſame Truth is implied.</p>
                  <p>Now, in all ſuch Texts as theſe, the <hi>Striving</hi> of the Holy Spirit with Sinners is evidently ſuppoſed, even the ſame that is expreſly mentioned, Gen. 6.3. <hi>My Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with Man.</hi> Sinners could not reſiſt the Holy Spirit, if he did not ſtrive with them, or were not engaged in ſome Deſign or Work wherein they might be ſuppoſed to oppoſe or reſiſt him.</p>
                  <p>Now, this Operation or Striving of the Spirit, in which Sinners act in Oppoſition to him, cannot be juſtly conceived to be a Striving in the proper and literal Senſe of the Word, which implies, a Perſon's doing all that is in his Power to accompliſh a Work, wherein he is engaged; for this is utterly inconſiſtent with the infinite Power of the Holy Ghoſt, who is One of the three Perſons in the God-head: This muſt, therefore, be attributed to the Spirit of God, after the Manner of Men, as Things are in Scripture frequently attributed to God. Thus, becauſe the Spirit of God does thoſe Things which have a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Tendency towards their Converſion and eternal Salvation, he is ſaid to ſtrive with them to that End, tho' he does not all that is in his Power; which, were he a Man or ſome other created Agent, he might be ſuppoſed to do, if he were reſiſted, and did not accompliſh what he attempted.</p>
                  <p>I muſt alſo obſerve, that the immediate <hi>End</hi> of this Operation of the Spirit, wherein he is ſuppoſed to be reſiſted, and many Times effectually, ſo that he accompliſheth not what he attempteth, cannot be the <hi>Regeneration</hi> of the Perſons he is ſaid to ſtrive with; for this being a Work, to which the infinite Power of God is required, like that by which he wrought in Chriſt when he raiſed him from the Dead, ſuch a Power muſt needs be exerted, whenever this Work is attempted; and then there can be no Reſiſtance given to the Holy Spirit therein. The Holy Spirit never fails of accompliſhing this, when he ſets about it: As the Soul is wholly <hi>paſſive</hi> in it, ſo it can make no Reſiſtance againſt it. When the Spirit works in this Way, none can hinder.</p>
                  <p>The Work, therefore, of the Holy Spirit which Sinners are ſuppoſed to reſiſt and to prevent, is a Work of quite a different Nature from that but now mentioned: A Work in which the Spirit of God acts in a <hi>moral,</hi> not in a <hi>phyſical</hi> Way (if I may uſe theſe Terms) I mean he works in the Way of <hi>moral Suaſion,</hi> by offering Matter of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:005439_0180_101832b2151b2ed8"/>
and Awakening to thoſe he is ſaid to ſtrive with. He ſets proper Arguments and Motives before them, and inculcates the ſame upon their Mind and Conſcience, to perſuade and excite them to apply themſelves to the Things wherein their everlaſting Peace and Welfare is concerned. He uſeth Means to remove their Prejudices againſt the Things which he perſuades them to, and to ſtir them up to improve the Powers which they have latent in them, but ſeem as if they had not, and will never exert, unleſs they be in this Way aſſiſted. This, I ſay, is the Way of the Spirit's Working, when he ſtrives with Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in order to their Good. And thus he ſtrives with them in a Way, unto the Succeſs of which their own Concurrence and Activity are required; which to the Act of <hi>Regeneration</hi> it is not; tho' in the Work <hi>preparatory</hi> to this it is.</p>
                  <p>Now, in the Spirit's Striving here intended, I do not ſuppoſe what he does by the written and preached Word, only to be included; but doubt not that he alſo ſtrives with Sinners by inſtructive and convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Providences, and ſometimes by the Miniſtry of his holy Angels, and immediate Suggeſtions; by all which Means, Things are bro't to the Minds of ſinful Men, which tend to inſtruct and excite them to their Duty: But ſtill this is ſtriving with them in a moral Way; not by attempting to create new Powers in them, which they are without. And if the Striving of the Holy Spirit be in the Way now expreſſed, it is eaſy to conceive how he may be refuſed by ſinful Men, and his Deſign and Work fruſtrated; becauſe Perſuaſions, properly ſuch, ſuppoſe a Power in the Subjects perſuaded, either to do or not do the Things they are perſuaded to: For to what End is a Perſon perſuaded to do that which he is ſuppoſed, either to have no Power to perform, or no Power to let alone; unleſs the Perſuaſions uſed are ſuppoſed to give him Power to do the Thing required? And then he is enabled to do it in a <hi>moral</hi> (not a phyſical) Way, which I willingly allow, <hi>i. e.</hi> he is excited and made willing to do that which he had Power before (in a phyſical Senſe) to perform; but never would have performed (and in the Senſe explained could not) without ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions. Thus have I ſhewed what that Striving of the Spirit of God is, which Sinners are here ſuppoſed to reſiſt and quench.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall proceed to conſider <hi>how</hi> ſinful Men <hi>reſiſt</hi> and <hi>quench</hi> the Spirit, in theſe Operations. And here I ſhall briefly name ſome of the principal Ways in which this is done. And,</p>
                  <p n="1">(1) Sinners reſiſt and quench the Spirit when they will not hearken and attend to what he ſays to them. All that God ſays to ſinful Men
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:005439_0181_101832618f3c7f58"/>
in his written and preached Word, by the Voice of his Providence, and by the Miniſtry of his Angels; by all which they are put in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their many Sins, and the Duties required of them; all theſe, I ſay, are the Voice of the Holy Spirit to them, unto whom the Application of Redemption moſt eſpecially belongs. Now, when Sinners refuſe to hear and conſider what the Holy Spirit does in theſe Ways ſay to them, this is evidently to reſiſt and quench him. By thus refuſing to hear the Voice of the Holy Spirit, Sinners refuſe to receive Influences and Convictions, the giving of which is the ſpecial End of the Spirit's being ſent into the World to them, as appears in <hi>John</hi> 16. and 30.</p>
                  <p n="2">(2) Sinners reſiſt the Spirit of God in their Refuſal of the Offers of his Mercy made to them, thro' a Redeemer, by <hi>neglecting the great Salvation</hi> offered to them, as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. The Application of that Redemption which has been purchaſed for ſinful Men, does eſpecially belong to the Holy Spirit, as his Work; and to this End he labours with Sinners to prepare and qualify them to be Partakers of it, and make them willing to go to Jeſus Chriſt for the Benefits offered to them: He calls, invites and perſuades them to do ſo. Now, when they refuſe to obey theſe Calls, they in this, in a very eſpecial Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, reſiſt and quench the Holy Spirit of God. This eſpecially was the Sin with which the <hi>Jews</hi> were charged. John 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have Life.</hi> The like we have in <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. The ſame Sin is called a <hi>doing Deſpite to the Spirit of Grace</hi>: Becauſe the Tendency of the Influences of the Holy Spirit, in the Work of common Grace, is to bring Sinners to an Acceptance of the Saviour, and Salvation offered to them, in which Work of his, they wickedly reſiſt him. See <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29.</p>
                  <p>Sinners may eſpecially be looked upon as Reſiſters of the Holy Spirit, in this Work of his, when they fall away after he has wrought a very conſiderable Change on them, has actually done a great deal for them, in order to their being made Partakers of the ſpecial Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies offered to them in the new Covenant, and ſo brought them very <hi>nigh to the Kingdom of God,</hi> as that Scribe was, <hi>Mark</hi> 12.34. This I take to be the very Caſe ſuppoſed in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24, 26. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. and 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. and in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38, 39. which Places I only here refer my Reader to.</p>
                  <p>But moſt of all do Sinners reſiſt and quench the Spirit of God, when the Oppoſition which they give to him and his Work, is with
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:005439_0182_101832b78a3aaae8"/>
an Intent to reproach and diſhonour him, and the gracious Deſign wherein he is engaged. This ſeems to be the Crime (or the great Aggravation of the Crime) of the Scribes and Phariſees, when they ſaid, <hi>Doth not this Fellow,</hi> (meaning our Lord) <hi>caſt out Devils by</hi> Beelzebub <hi>the Prince of Devils?</hi> Matth. 12.24. And ſo in <hi>Mark</hi> 3.22. it is ſaid, <hi>The Scribe which came down from</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>ſaid, He hath</hi> Beelzebub, <hi>and by the Prince of the Devils caſteth he out De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils.</hi> And the Blaſphemy, for which they are ſpoken of as in Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of eternal Damnation, is thus deſcribed in Verſe 30. <hi>Becauſe, ſaid they, he hath an unclean Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">(3) Sinners reſiſt the Holy Spirit by obſtinately rebelling againſt him, and refuſing to do what he requires of them. Of Sinners thus reſiſting the Spirit of God we have an Account in ſuch Texts of Scripture as Iſai. 63.10. <hi>But they rebelled, and vexed his Holy Spirit: Therefore he was turned to be their Enemy, and fought againſt them.</hi> Jer. 2.25. and Chap. 44.16. <hi>As for the Word thou haſt ſpoken unto us in the Name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Eſpecially when Perſons ſin againſt Light and Knowledge, they are guilty of reſiſting and quenching the Spirit of God. When if notwithſtanding Men are by the Holy Spirit convinced, that ſuch and ſuch Actions are evil and provoking in God's Sight, yet they will do them, in this they greatly ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt. Of this Kind of Sin our Saviour ſpeaketh, John 15.22. <hi>If I had not come and ſpoken unto them, they had not had Sin: But now they have no Cloak for their Sins.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now that the Spirit of God does ſometimes utterly withdraw from Perſons who have long reſiſted him in the Inſtances above ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, is what I am here next to ſhew; and the ſame is moſt mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly held forth in Gen. 6.3. <hi>And the Lord ſaid, My Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with Man, for that he alſo is Fleſh.</hi> Which Words are well explained by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle, Chap. 3. Ver. 18, 19, 20. <hi>For Chriſt alſo hath once ſuffered for Sins, the Juſt for the Unjuſt, (that he might bring us to God) being put to Death in the Fleſh, but quickned by the Spirit: By which alſo he went and preached unto the Spirits in Priſon; which ſometime were diſobedient, when once the Long-ſuffering of God waited in the Days of</hi> Noah, <hi>while the Ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is eight, Souls were ſaved by Water.</hi> Thus the Spirit of God departed from <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.14. And thus <hi>David</hi> prayed, that the holy Spirit of God might not be taken
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:005439_0183_10183263a7461b90"/>
from him, when probably he tho't himſelf unconverted: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.11. As for God's true Saints, he hath promiſed that he will never take his holy Spirit from them. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.20, 21. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.38, 39, 40.</p>
                  <p>There are other Texts of Scripture, wherein the final Withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit of God from ſome, who long reſiſt and rebel againſt him, is very evidently implied: Such as that, Pſal. 81.11, 12. <hi>But my People would not hearken to my Voice: And</hi> Iſrael <hi>would none of me. So I gave them up unto their own Hearts Luſts: And they walked in their own Counſels.</hi> With this Place compare theſe following, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.9. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 24.13. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.11. When God wholly and forever gives up any Sinners to their own Heart's Luſts, reſolving that he will let them follow the Devices and Counſels of their own wicked Hearts, his thus taking his Spirit forever from them, is therein moſt evidently implied: And what the dreadful Conſequences of this are, comes next in order to be conſidered.</p>
                  <p>Now, when God deals thus with any of the rebellious Children of Men, they are undone, and that forever: It is then impoſſible to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new them again to Repentance,</hi> as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6. When the Spirit of God has utterly forſaken them, there then <hi>remains no more Sacrifice for their Sins</hi>; they having <hi>trodden under Foot the Blood of the Son of God,</hi> and therein <hi>done Deſpite to the Spirit of Grace,</hi> as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26,—29. This is a <hi>Sin unto Death,</hi> which we are required to pray for the Pardon of. It is impoſſible that the Sin of ſuch Perſons ſhould ever be pardoned: And at preſent I ſee no Reaſon but that it may be the ſame <hi>Sin againſt the holy Ghoſt,</hi> that is ſpoken of in Matth. 12. and <hi>Mark.</hi> 3. I ſuppoſe the Sin in thoſe Places intended, to conſiſt no leſs in the Enmity of Men's Hearts againſt the holy Spirit, and the Work he is engaged in, and the Reſiſtance they give to him in it, than in the Words they utter againſt him: And I am far from agreeing with a certain Author, who thinks the Sin intended in theſe Places cannot be committed without Men's pronouncing thoſe blaſphemous Words here ſpoken of. Perhaps ſuch malicious Speeches are rather to be looked upon as a plain Indication of the Perſons guilty of the horrendous Crime, by our Saviour pronounced unpardonable, than as that, in which the intended Sin does either wholly or principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt. And if this be the Truth of the Caſe, I ſuppoſe none can be known by others to have committed the mentioned Sin, except ſuch Blaſphemers as our Saviour deſcribes: And I believe that Sinners can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ordinarily in this Life know that they have ſinned unpardonably.
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:005439_0184_101832ba73612708"/>
In this, I think, I well agree with the Learned Mr. How, in his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's Tears,</hi> which Book I have not now by me.</p>
                  <p>Indeed none have committed that Sin which is unpardonable, but thoſe from whom the Spirit has finally withdrawn himſelf, or is about ſo to do; and it is certain, that all ſuch are guilty of an unpardonable Sin: And the Reaſon why it is impoſſible ſuch Sinners ſhould ever obtain a Pardon, is, becauſe the Spirit of God has utterly forſaken them, and will never return to them again; and on this Account it is impoſſible they ſhould ever be <hi>renewed again to Repentance,</hi> as in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6. In which Clauſe it is implied, that they once had a <hi>Repentance</hi> which they have loſt, and fallen from, but not of the ſame Kind which the Regenerate only have; for thoſe who have that never fall away, as thoſe do ſpoken of in the Place referred to, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.6. Nor can Perſons be ſuch Apoſtates in whom common Grace, which implies Repentance of a lower Kind than that of the Regenerate, has never been wrought. But the Spirit does not bring all with whom he ſtrives unto this Length, which is the ſame with that deſcribed, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. without attaining unto which Perſons may provoke the Spirit of God to leave them: But I think that ordinarily ſuch cannot know that the Spirit of God will no more ſtrive with them.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall have finiſhed this Chapter, when I have ſaid, That its being a Truth, that the Spirit of God having been long reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by wicked Men, may at laſt thus leave them (as is in many Scriptures implied) ſo that hereupon their Deſtruction is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable, can be no Evidence that before this they could not comply with the Terms of the new Covenant. If now they are given up to their own Heart's Luſts, ſo that they cannot do this, it followeth not that they could never have done it. If now <hi>the Things of their Peace are hidden from their Eyes,</hi> it does not thence appear, that they always were ſo; nay, the contrary is plainly implied in the Words alluded to. If now God will not hear their Cries to him for Mercy, as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24. it followeth not, that he never would have heard them, if they would have called on him: The contrary is plainly implied in the Place quoted. If Sinners will not <hi>ſeek the Lord while he may be found,</hi> and <hi>call upon him while he is near</hi>; no Wonder if he will not hear their Cries, when the Day of his Patience is at an End. Nor can Sinners ſeek the Lord after their Day of Grace is ended, as they might have done, while he was ſtriving with them by his Word and Spirit. They now, indeed, cry for Deliverance when they feel the <hi>Terrors</hi> of the Almighty ſeizing on their Souls, as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.26, 27.
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:005439_0185_1018326725eaae28"/>
which Cries are nothing like the Prayers of Sinners, tho' unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, while under ſenſible <hi>Encouragements</hi> from the Invitations of the Goſpel, and while God ſays to them, as in 2 Cor. 6.2. <hi>Now is the accepted Time; now is the Day of Salvation.</hi> After the Door of God's Mercy is ſhut (tho' here in this World) Sinner's Cries for Deliverance from the Torments which they may ſuffer, are of the ſame Kind with thoſe of the Wicked after this Life is at an End, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.25, 26. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 25.10, 11.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HO' my Tho'ts with Reſpect to the Point here propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to further Conſideration, have, I hope, been in ſome tolerable Meaſure manifeſted, ſo that I tho't not to have added any Thing further; yet that I may not fail of being underſtood, with Reſpect to this important Article, I ſhall endeavour more fully to explain and confirm what I hold.</p>
                  <p>I think I have ſufficiently proved in Part II. Chap. V. of this Eſſay, that neither the Grace of Regeneration, nor any Act implying it, can be the Condition on which Salvation is offered in the Goſpel; and conſequently if Salvation be conditionally offered, as I have ſhewed it is, Part I. Chap. IV. the Condition required is not performed by Virtue of any Power received in our Regeneration, that, in Order of Nature, following our Faith and Juſtification. It is therefore here ſuppoſed, that the Power by which any Sinner <hi>believeth unto Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10. be that Power what it will, and however the Sinner comes by it, is ſuch a Power as the Sinner may, and muſt have before he is <hi>born again,</hi> or <hi>born of the Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor is there any Doubt here, whether this Power is given to Man by God, <hi>from whom every good and perfect Gift cometh down,</hi> Jam. 1.
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:005439_0186_101832bdb2a64b18"/>
17. tho' it may be very reaſonably enquired in what Way and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner God gives this Power, and whether he gives it only to ſuch as when they have it uſe it well, and ſo actually comply with the Terms on which Salvation is offered to them.</p>
                  <p>That Sinners may have Power to do that which is never actually done by them, I know not of any that will deny, with whom I am any Ways likely to be concerned. I ſhall therefore take it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That it is poſſible for Perſons to do ſome Things which it is in their Power to avoid; and alſo not to do ſome Things which they have the Power to perform.</p>
                  <p>The Queſtion therefore here is only reſpecting the Power of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Condition on which Salvation is offered to Sinners; and this Inquiry can only here relate to thoſe Sinners that never accept of Salvation on the Terms of the new Covenant; for as for ſuch as do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of it, they certainly have a Power ſome Way or other to do ſo.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall then here enquire, whether ſuch as will not, and ſo do not, come to Jeſus Chriſt for Life, in the Manner required of them in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to their being ſaved, do fail of doing this for want of a Power ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to that End. And let it be remembred that I here ſpeak of ſuch only as enjoy the Means of Salvation, the Grace of God ſpoken of in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. And the Queſtion here is not, whether Sinners can <hi>believe to the ſaving of their Souls,</hi> without Aid and Aſſiſtance from God; but whether they might not do ſo, having ſuch Means and Helps as many have, who yet never comply with the Terms of the Goſpel, and ſo periſh for ever.</p>
                  <p>Nor do I by that Aid and Aſſiſtance which I ſuppoſe neceſſary in this Caſe, intend ſuch only as conſiſt in external Means; as the Word of God written and preached, the Sacraments of Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper, inſtructive and awakening Providences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe I ſuppoſe there is neceſſary unto a Sinner's doing what is required of him in the Goſpel, the Aids and Influences of God's holy Spirit to move and excite him to the Things required of him, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Duty to his Remembrance, and his Obligations to perform it; alſo by putting him in Mind of his Sins and the Calls given him in the Word of God to repent of them, and turn from them, and lay hold on the great Saviour provided for him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <pb n="172" facs="unknown:005439_0187_1018326a6ca1bc48"/>Theſe Motions and Influences of the holy Spirit, have all of them a Relation to the Things required of Man in the holy Scriptures, and not to Things which are not therein preſcribed; and are intended by the <hi>Strivings of God's Spirit,</hi> of which we read, <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.3. and which the Wicked <hi>reſiſt (Acts</hi> 7.31.) and <hi>quench,</hi> (1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19.) and whom they are ſaid in ſo doing to <hi>vex</hi> and <hi>grieve, Iſai.</hi> 63.10. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30.</p>
                  <p>In theſe Motions and Influences of the holy Spirit which I here ſpeak of, I confeſs I conceive he acts in a moral, rather than a phyſical Manner, <hi>viz.</hi> by inſtructing, reproving, exhorting, and perſuading, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not by creating any new Powers in Men's Souls; but by doing what is neceſſary on his Part in order to his moving and excit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men to the Performance of their Duty; and ſo rendring them the more inexcuſable if they engage not in it.</p>
                  <p>However theſe Motions of the Spirit being ſuch as Perſons may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, and yet never be ſavingly converted, they are quite of a different Nature from thoſe Operations of the Spirit of God, by which the great Work of Regeneration is effected, nor are they deſigned to the ſame End as theſe laſt mentioned are; but to excite Sinners to the Duties that are preparatory to a Work of ſaving Grace on their Souls, a Work <hi>like that which was wrought in Chriſt, when God raiſed him from the Dead,</hi> (Eph. 1.20.) and by which we are ſaid to be <hi>created anew in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works,</hi> Eph. 2.10.</p>
                  <p>Now the great Queſtion here is, Whether when Sinners are under ſuch a Work of God's Spirit, with the external Means afforded to ſuch as enjoy the Goſpel, and yet do not come to Chriſt for Life; whether, I ſay, theſe remain, being under ſuch Advantages, without any Power to believe to the ſaving of their Souls?</p>
                  <p>Now if this be affirmed by any, I confeſs I cannot agree with them in their Sentiments.</p>
                  <p>But for preventing Miſtakes in this important Article, I ſhall here diſtinguiſh of Impotency, which is two-fold; and each of theſe Kinds does ſuppoſe there may be a Power oppoſite to it. The Kinds of Impotency I here intend are by ſome, if I miſtake not, called <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>moral.</hi> I ſhall ſpeak of theſe two Kinds of Impotence according to the Notion I my ſelf have of them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="173" facs="unknown:005439_0188_1018106f4e5ac630"/>And <hi>firſt,</hi> By what I call a natural Impotence, I intend ſuch an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to do a Thing, as renders the Thing utterly impoſſible to be done by a Perſon without having a new Power or Powers given to him. Thus it is properly ſaid of a blind Man, that he cannot ſee; and of a deaf Man, that he cannot hear: And thus I acknowledge that it may be truly ſaid of a Perſon in a State of Nature; not being born of the Spirit, that he cannot perform any Actions that are truly ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual or holy. This is as impoſſible as it is for a <hi>Thorn-Buſh</hi> to bear <hi>Figs,</hi> or for a <hi>Bramble-Buſh</hi> to bear <hi>Grapes, Luke</hi> 6.44. Nothing leſs than changing the Nature of a Tree will render it capable of this. And thus he that is utterly deſtitute of ſaving Grace, cannot bring forth any Fruits of Holineſs, till he is ſavingly renewed and made a new Creature, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. No Arguments, Motives, or Perſuaſions can give Power to a Man in this Senſe unable to do a Thing, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it.</p>
                  <p>But then, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> There is another Kind of Impotency, which ariſes only from Error in Men's Judgments, and Obſtinacy in their Wills; and this does in ſome Sort diſable Perſons from doing ſome Things which otherwiſe they might do, were their Prejudices removed. However it may not be unfitly ſaid of Perſons under ſuch Diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that they cannot for the preſent do this or that Thing, which they have an Averſion to, when yet ſuch Perſons want not a natural Power to perform what they are ſaid to be unable to do. Thus when a Man is perſuaded that his doing this or that which he is urged to, will prove hurtful and injurious to him, it may be ſaid, that at preſent he cannot do it, <hi>i. e.</hi> he cannot find in his Heart a Willingneſs to engage in doing that which he thinks will rather hurt him than do him good: Or if he thinks he might obtain ſome Benefit by doing the Thing, yet thinks the Advantages he might reap by it will not countervail the Difficulties he muſt undergo in that Self-denial which is requiſite in order to it, he cannot bring himſelf to a Willingneſs to do it.</p>
                  <p>Perſons are in Scripture in this Senſe ſometimes ſpoken of as unable to do this, that or the other Thing, which yet really they want not a natural Power to perform. Thus it is ſaid of <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Brethren, that <hi>they hated him ſo, that they could not ſpeak peaceably of him,</hi> (Gen. 37.4.) Such Impotence as this is plainly ſpoken of by our Saviour, and the Nature of it unfolded in Luke 11.5, 6 7, 8. <hi>He ſaid unto them, Which of you ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>n, he <hi>will not,</hi> Verſe 8. And this which he would not, he is by and by ſuppoſed to do. The ſame Kind of Impotency is pleaded in Excuſe for not going to the great Goſpel-Feaſt, Luke 14.20. <hi>I have married a Wife, and therefore I cannot come.</hi> And our Saviour himſelf acknowledges this Sort of Impotency in ſome Men with Reſpect to their believing in him, John 5.44. <hi>How can ye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve which receive Honour one of another, and ſeek not the Honour that cometh from God only?</hi> This Kind of Impotency is not an abſolute and utter Inability to do the Thing which Men are ſometimes ſaid to be unable to do. This is often made evident by Perſons actually doing what they have alledged themſelves to have no Power fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Their <hi>could not,</hi> being indeed no more than this, that they <hi>would not,</hi> and not their being utterly unable to do the Thing intended. This is a Sort of <hi>Cannot</hi> which may be cured by good Inſtructions and Arguments which yet properly give no new Power; and Men may help them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt this Sort of Inability by reaſoning themſelves out of their Prejudices againſt the Things, which they and others may imagine they have no Power to do; ſo that they may ſee it was not Want of Power, but Want of a Will, that hindred them from doing as they ſhould.</p>
                  <p>In the Senſe now explained I acknowledge, that ſome cannot come to Chriſt for Life, and never will, except the Father draw them, as in <hi>John</hi> 6.44. But then our Lord himſelf ſhews wherein this Ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility conſiſts. John 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have Life</hi>; and Matth. 23.37. <hi>How often would I have gathered thy Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren together, even as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings, and ye would not.</hi> It would, in my Opinion, be very improper to charge Men's not coming to Chriſt merely on their wilful Rebellion, if a real Inability were the Cauſe of it.</p>
                  <p>If it be here ſaid to be true of all that do not come to Chriſt for Life, that, in a ſtrict and proper Senſe, they have no Power ſo to do. I muſt crave Leave to diſſent from this, 'till I can ſee otherwiſe than at preſent I can do.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="175" facs="unknown:005439_0190_101832c1145d12e0"/>And I ſhall only here inſiſt a little more fully on one Argument againſt what I here oppoſe. I deſire to know what Kindneſs it is to any Sinner, that he has an Offer of Salvation made to him in the Goſpel, if he have no Power given to him to accept of that Offer. What Kindneſs is it to a Perſon that he has Tidings of a Saviour, and is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed that he ſhall be ſaved by him, on this Condition that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on him, when, this notwithſtanding, God never did nor ever will give him any Power to believe? Eſpecially ſuppoſing that if he does not believe, he ſhall be puniſhed with a much ſorer Puniſhment than he ſhould have been, if he had never had an Offer of eternal Life made to him; which will be the Caſe of ſuch as enjoy the Goſpel, and yet do not believe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.15. I confeſs I think that God is much more merciful unto ſuch as never have any Offer of Life, than he is to thoſe who have an Offer on ſuch Terms.</p>
                  <p>And yet is it not a Truth, that all who enjoy the Goſpel of Chriſt, ſeverally conſidered, are bound to bleſs God that he has ſent his Son into the World to redeem them, and ſent his Goſpel to invite them to believe in him, that ſo they may have eternal Life thro' him? If it be ſaid, that no Man unto whom the Offer of Salvation is made does know any Thing to the contrary but that he is one of God's Elect, and ſo ſhall ſooner or later be enabled to believe on the Son of God, and obtain Life thro' his Name; I anſwer, that if he knew he was ſo, he would be bound to praiſe God for ſuch an invaluable Mercy; but ſince he does not know whether he is one of theſe or not, he does not know whether he have any Cauſe to give Thanks to God for the Offer of Salvation or no; and God does not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire us to give him Praiſe for ſuppoſed Favours, which we neither do nor can know we have received: Nay rather, to do this would be to mock him. And it ſeems as if it would be to mock us, if he ſhould make a great Shew of Kindneſs to us when he really ſhews us no Favour, as indeed, according to the Principle oppoſed, I affirm, he ſhews none to thoſe unto whom he gives no Power to accept of the Mercy which he ſeems graciouſly to offer to them. But God forbid, that I ſhould have any ſuch hard Thoughts of him, as to think that he offers Salvation to Sinners, and threatens them with a double Damnation in Caſe they perform not the Condition on which that Offer is made; and yet neither gives nor offers them any Power by which they may perform the Condition of that (to all Appearance) moſt gracious Offer.</p>
                  <p>If it be here demanded, what Mercy it is in God to make an Offer of eternal Life to ſuch Sinners as he certainly knows will never accept
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:005439_0191_1018327273418178"/>
of it; but will, notwithſtanding ſuch an Offer, periſh forever: To this I anſwer, that the Kindneſs of God in the Offers which he makes of his everlaſting Mercies, muſt be judged of according to the Nature of the Condition on which he offers them, and not according to the Events following ſuch Offers, and his Knowledge of thoſe Events. What if Sinners never accept the Benefits offered, and God knew they would not when he offered his Favours to them; (as it is impoſſible that he ſhould not know what they would do) yet ſuppoſing the Offers to be made upon reaſonable Terms, ſuch as Sinners may comply with if their own wilful Obſtinacy does not hinder them, his Kindneſs in ſuch Offers is manifeſt. If this be not granted it will follow, that God ſhews no Kindneſs in the Offers of Salvation which he makes to any others beſides thoſe that are eventually ſaved. But who dares thus to affirm: And I can hardly think any Man will affirm, that it is a Kindneſs in God to offer Salvation to any Sinner without ever giving him Power to accept of it.</p>
                  <p>But ſome ſeem to fear that the Doctrine I plead for, is not calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to <hi>hide Pride from Man,</hi> and keep him humble. Unto which I ſay, (1) That I do not think that any Doctrine is well adapted to make and keep Men humble which is contrary to Truth, which I ſuppoſe the Doctrine I oppoſe to be. (2) I would aſk which of theſe two Doctrines has the greateſt Tendency to make and keep Men humble, <hi>viz. Firſt,</hi> this, That if any Sinner that has the Offer of Salvation made to him does continue in his Unbelief, and ſo periſheth, the Reaſon of this is, becauſe the Condition on which God offered to ſave him was wholly above his Power, and ſuch as he could not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly comply with: Or, <hi>Secondly,</hi> this, that if any Sinner fails of that Salvation which he has an Offer of in the Goſpel, the Reaſon is not, becauſe he is utterly unable to accept of it on Goſpel Terms; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Obſtinacy is ſuch that he will not, unleſs God out of his diſtinguiſhing Grace does more for him than he ever does for any Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that continues in his Unbelief, and ſo periſheth. This laſt is what I maintain: the former is what I oppoſe. What I affirm tends both to humble and encourage Sinners; what I oppoſe tends greatly to diſcourage them, rather than to humble them.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> COME now to the third and laſt Part of my Eſſay, which is to ſhew,</p>
               <p>That the Doctrine maintained in the two former Parts of it, is a Truth of very great Importance, and many Ways uſeful.</p>
               <p>If now it be demanded of me (as by ſome it has been) what the Advantages are of inſiſting ſo much on the Hypotheſis I endeavour to defend; and what will be gained by it, if the Truth of it were granted to me; I unto this anſwer, <hi>Much every Way.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I preſume there is no Truth that is aſſerted in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and which can be well defended by the Oracles of God, but what may have very profitable Inferences or Concluſions drawn from it: And much more may this be aſſerted concerning a Truth ſo abundantly affirmed in the Goſpel of our Salvation, and interwoven with all the Parts of it, as that is which I ſuppoſe I have now ſufficiently defended.</p>
               <p>I ſhall, therefore, now proceed to inſtance in ſome of the Advantages we gain by admitting of it.; and to ſhew what uſeful Inferences it yields to us; and this I will endeavour in the following Chapters.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. I. <hi>THE FIRST USE</hi> of the Truth aſſerted, is, That it gives Light to many Texts of Scripture, which cannot be well underſtood without it.</head>
                  <p>To inſtance in ſome of them.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE are ſeveral Texts of Scripture, in which it is plainly affirmed, That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt died for all.</hi> Heb. 2.9. That <hi>by the Grace of God he ſhould taſte Death for every Man.</hi> 1 John 2.2. <hi>He is the Propitiation for our Sins: And not for ours only, but for the Sins of the whole World</hi>; with which that well agreeth, Iſai. 53.6. <hi>All we like Sheep have gone aſtray: We have turned every one to his own Way, and the Lord hath laid on him the Iniquity of us all.</hi> We have alſo the ſame Thing, in effect, aſſerted by our Saviour himſelf, John 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life.</hi> I know that many of our Divines endeavour to give ſuch an Expoſition of theſe Places and others like them, as to reconcile them to their own Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Chriſt's dying for the <hi>Elect only</hi>: But my Deſign is not to conſider the Weight and Strength of what they ſay to this Purpoſe. However, I know that all they can do or ſay, does not ſatisfy me and many others. And ſeveral who were no <hi>Arminians</hi> have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to maintain this as a ſacred Truth, That Jeſus Chriſt died for the whole World of Mankind; who yet have maintained the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſpecial Grace, in order to the Converſion and Salvation of the Elect of God: And with theſe I agree, ſuppoſing they mean, (1) That none will ever ſavingly believe in Chriſt, and ſo obtain eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, for whom God does no more than he does for thoſe that never ſo believe. (2) That without an Act of his ſpecial Grace, and of his mighty Power, ſuch as none but the Elect have experience of, none are, or ever can be, regenerated or born again: But if thoſe who
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:005439_0194_101832ca7701a270"/>
go this Way deny that any beſides the Elect have that Grace given them, by the Help whereof they may comply with, or perform, the Condition on which Salvation is offered to them, not being without a Power by which they may do it, I can by no Means agree with them. By Grace I here intend ſuch as is meant, and to be underſtood in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. and <hi>Iſai.</hi> 5.4.</p>
                  <p>To what End can we ſuppoſe Jeſus Chriſt ſhould lay down his Life to purchaſe Salvation for any, ſo far forth that they might be ſaved on ſome Condition propoſed to them in the Goſpel, (as he has indeed done, <hi>John</hi> 3.16.1 <hi>John</hi> 4.9, 10.) without a Suppoſition of their having Power given them to perform that Condition? What Advantage has any Sinner by this, that he may be ſaved, if he believe and repent, or perform ſuch or ſuch a Condition, when he neither is, nor ever will be, enabled to perform it? For ſuch muſt as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly and unavoidably periſh, as they ſhould have done if Chriſt had not died for them. I therefore ſuppoſe their Principles to be altogether inconſiſtent, who hold, that Chriſt died for all, and yet deny that God gives Power to any beſides the Elect, to perform the Condition on which Salvation is offered to all, unto whom the Goſpel is preached. And I would here aſk any One who thinks he can vindicate this Principle of Dr. TWISSE in particular,
<q>That Chriſt died for all, <hi>i. e.</hi> to purchaſe Salvation for them on this Condition, that they believe and repent,</q>
who yet hold, as I ſuppoſe he did, That the Faith and Repentance to this End required of Sinners is of that Kind which is given in Regeneration; and which no Man can have 'till he is born again; (becauſe none but the Regenerate can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and repent) how theſe Things can conſiſt one with the other?</p>
                  <p>But now, on the Hypotheſis which I have endeavoured to defend, Chriſt not only obtained this Advantage for Sinners, that they might be ſaved on the Condition of the goſpel Covenant, but alſo obtained that Grace for them, by which they ſhould be enabled to perform that Condition. But then the Condition required, according to my Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, is not this, that they ſavingly change their own Hearts, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come regenerate Saints; but that they, in a ſuitable Manner, ſeek to God to do this for them; and yet in ſuch a Manner, as with his Help they may, before they are new Creatures.</p>
                  <p>And thus I account for what is affirmed in thoſe Texts of Scripture, where Jeſus Chriſt is ſaid to have <hi>died for all Men,</hi> without denying what is plainly aſſerted in them: And I am glad that on my Principles I am not obliged to depart from the literal Senſe of ſuch Texts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="180" facs="unknown:005439_0195_10183278151f5d28"/>Again 2. There are in ſeveral Texts of Scripture, ſo far as I can ſee, as plain <hi>conditional</hi> Promiſes of <hi>converting Grace,</hi> as can in Words well be expreſſed; ſome of which Places I have already conſidered and vindicated in this Diſcourſe; as <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.22, 23. and Chap. 2.3, 4, 5. <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13. and others. But ſuch as are fixed in this Principle, That God has not promiſed to give his holy Spirit to any Perſon, on Condition of his doing any Thing that is poſſible for a Sinner to do, before he is actually converted, and endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Grace of Regeneration, ſeem to me to be at a great Loſs how to account for what is ſaid in ſeveral ſuch Promiſes. Thus when God promiſes to give <hi>true ſpiritual Wiſdom</hi> to thoſe that <hi>cry after it, lifting up their Voices for it, ſeeking it as Silver, and ſearching for it as for hid Treaſure,</hi> as in <hi>Prov.</hi> 2.2, 3, 4, 5. before mentioned; the Meaning of this Place is commonly ſaid to be, that God will give more ſpiritual Wiſdom to ſuch as are already ſpiritually wiſe, which ſuch Seekers are already ſuppoſed to be. Now this Place thus ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, is not allowed to be a Direction to ſuch as are yet deſtitute of ſaving Grace or Holineſs, (the Wiſdom intended in it) what Courſe they ſhould take, in order to their obtaining it; (which yet is the plain Deſign of the Words from Verſe 1. to the 6th.) but only to ſhew ſuch as are already ſpiritually wiſe, how they may become yet wiſer.</p>
                  <p>For my Part I dare not ſo expound this Place, and ſeveral others like it; and I believe none elſe would, were it not for a prae-conceived Opinion, that a Principle of ſaving Grace is not on any Condition offered and promiſed to Sinners: Which Opinion I know no ſolid Ground for. Whereas on the other Hand, on the Principle by me received, all ſuch Places may be taken and underſtood according to the plain and literal Senſe of them; and we need not be put to any Difficulty to account for the Meaning of them: And I can aſſure my Reader, I have met with pious and learned Men, who have declared to me, what Difficulty they have been put to about the Meaning of ſuch Places; and who have declared their Satisfaction in the ſame Account of them that has now been given.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall inſtance in one other Sort of Texts, which, I think, cannot be underſtood without allowing my Hypotheſis to be true: I mean ſuch Texts as require <hi>Perſeverance,</hi> as a neceſſary Condition of Man's Salvation, or ſuch ſpecial Mercies as imply Salvation in them, to ſuch as perſevere, <hi>Matth.</hi> 10.22. and Chap. 24.13. <hi>He that endureth to the End, ſhall be ſaved.</hi> We have the ſame in Effect, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.13. The ſame Thing is implied in <hi>Hoſea</hi> 6.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.9. and I doubt
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:005439_0196_101832ce285d5020"/>
not alſo in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25,—30. I cannot think that the Meaning of theſe, and ſuch like Texts, is this, That if ſuch as are <hi>Believers,</hi> in the ſtricteſt Senſe of this Word, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſuch as are born of God, and become <hi>new Creatures,</hi> do not fall from their Faith, and become Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers, and again Unregenerate, then they ſhall inherit eternal Life. Such as theſe have ſufficient Aſſurance given, that they are in no Danger of ſuch an Apoſtacy, as appears in <hi>John</hi> 5.24. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.38, 39, 40. <hi>John</hi> 10.27, 28, 29. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2,—5. and in many other Places, as thoſe with whom I diſpute do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. <hi>Calviniſts</hi> maintain that juſtifying Faith, by which the Elect of God receive Jeſus Chriſt and all his ſaving Benefits, is but one Act; that a Sinner does no ſooner begin to believe with Faith of that Kind, than he is perfectly juſtified and firmly entitled to all the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Mercies which are offered in the new Covenant; and that in this Covenant, even his Perſeverance, and his being made perfect in Holineſs, is firmly promiſed, ſo that there is no Poſſibility that any ſuch ſhould fall away and eternally periſh.</p>
                  <p>Now, how incongruous would it be to tell Perſons in ſuch a State as this, that they ſhall be ſaved, if they do not fall from Grace, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing again into that Eſtate, which they were in before they were born of the Spirit! I think nothing could be more abſurd. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conclude, that the mentioned Texts can have no ſuch Meaning. They cannot be intended as Cautions to regenerate Perſons, againſt a total and final Apoſtacy, they having already fully complied with the Terms, on which the whole of their Salvation is ſecured to them, in the Covenant of Grace.</p>
                  <p>But now, on my Hypotheſis, there may be a fair Account given of all ſuch Texts as theſe mentioned: For, according to that, I freely acknowledge a Perſon may have the ſame Kind of Faith which is the Condition of the new Covenant, and yet be ſtill in an unregenerate and unjuſtified State; becauſe the Covenant I ſpeak of does not only compriſe in it the Condition of it, Men's beginning to act ſuch a Kind of Faith: So that believing for a Moment ſhould be ſufficient to entitle the Sinner to the ſame Mercies of that Covenant: This, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Tenor of the new Covenant, will not anſwer the End: But the Condition of it includes this alſo in it, that the Sinner that would be ſaved in the Way it preſcribeth, muſt perſevere and go on to believe, during the whole of that Term of Time which God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his good Will and Pleaſure, has alotted for his Probation, in order to his ſecuring his eternal Happineſs; which how long it may be, God does not ordinarily reveal to thoſe unto whom he grants
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:005439_0197_1018327d41a2caf0"/>
it, but keeps it in his own Power; yet will he be mindful of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and take Care to fulfill that Word of his, on which he has given us Reaſon to depend, Gal. 6.9. <hi>Let us not be weary in well-doing; for in due Seaſon we ſhall reap, if we faint not.</hi> With which Words many other Texts very well agree, ſuch as thoſe laſt mentioned, and <hi>Luke</hi> 18. Beginning. And then God fulfills ſuch Promiſes unto thoſe who wait for his Salvation, when he pardoneth their Sins, and poureth out his holy Spirit on them, as in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.39. <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is very neceſſary that the Goſpel, and the Offers of it made to ſinful Men, ſhould be very plain, and eaſily underſtood. Mankind in their lapſed State, unto whom the Offers of Salvation by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer are here ſuppoſed to be made, are in a State of Darkneſs. That is their Character, Eph. 4.18. <hi>Having their Underſtanding darkned, being alienated from the Life of God, thro' the Ignorance that is in them, becauſe of the Blindneſs of their Heart.</hi> They are not only exceeding back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to believe, but are alſo dull of underſtanding the Things that belong to their eternal Peace and Welfare, however clearly they are propoſed to them: How then ſhould they underſtand them, if they are not clearly and intelligibly propoſed? And it ſeems to me, that the common Way of Preaching the Goſpel, is ſomewhat defective in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>eſpect The Way is not made ſo plain as it ſhould be. Now I hope that if the Doctrine I plead for be admitted as true, the Way of Salvation by a Redeemer will be made much the plainer.</p>
                  <p>There are two great Difficulties that the apoſtate Children of Men labour under; one of them is that State of Guilt, in which they are,
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:005439_0198_101832d1a23f9400"/>
in Reſpect of which they are all, without Exception, <hi>Children of Wrath,</hi> Eph. 2.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. The other is that Corruption of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, unto which, by the Fall, they have been made ſubject; and which in the Way of Propagation, has been conveyed from Parent to Child, even to all deſcending from <hi>Adam,</hi> in the Way of natural Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, from Age to Age, ever ſince the Beginning of the World: For <hi>Adam,</hi> our moral Head and Repreſentative, having ſinned againſt God in eating the forbidden Fruit, God was ſo provoked with him that he took his Holy Spirit from him, and deprived him of his Image, as was declared in Part I. Chap. I. And all his Poſterity ever ſince, being liable to the penal Conſequences of his Apoſtacy, have been brought into the World in the like miſerable State, with Natures de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved as his was. Hence ſuch Texts as theſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. &amp; 58.3. alſo <hi>Iſai.</hi> 48.8. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. and Verſe 19. Now while this Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption remains, Men are uncapable of Happineſs by a Sight of God, and Communion with him, as the Scriptures abundantly declare, <hi>John</hi> 3.3. and Verſe 5. with which Places that well agreeth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9, 10. and Verſe 14, 15. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.8. Nor can ſuch unclean Perſons enter into the Kingdom of Glory, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27.</p>
                  <p>Now, that the Goſpel may afford ſufficient Relief to Sinners with Relation to both theſe Difficulties which they are under, it ſeems needful it ſhould afford a Remedy in Reſpect of both; and I ſuppoſe it does ſo, by offering Deliverance from one, as well as the other of them, without which it is impoſſible ſuch miſerable Sinners ſhould be made happy.</p>
                  <p>Let us now conſider, whether this be really done in the common Way of Preaching the Goſpel; and whether it be not done in the Way which, according to my Principles, it ought to be.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt</hi> then, according to the common and allowed Way of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel, there is only ſuppoſed to be an Offer of Pardon or Juſtification made to Sinners, with ſuch other Benefits as are ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to follow thereon; ſuch as Peace with God, Adoption, Growth in Grace, Perſeverance in it, and eternal Glory in the heavenly World: But there is no Offer ſuppoſed to be made to Sinners, of Regeneration, or a new Heart and a new Spirit, or of the reſtoring God's Image to them; which is a Mercy they as much need as the others mentioned. It is ſuppoſed that God does not, on any Terms, offer to do this for them: Nay, it is earneſtly diſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>d that he does not. They are, indeed, told that God may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> for them, and that there are Reaſons for them to h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>pe for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="184" facs="unknown:005439_0199_1018330f03ea51c0"/>
Promiſe they have none, on which they may ground ſuch Hope: Nor can they do any Thing, but ſin and provoke God, 'till this be firſt done for them; and ſo, I think, nothing that has any Tendency to prevail with God to grant them this Mercy.</p>
                  <p>And whereas ſuch Sinners are frequently ſaid to have an Offer of Salvation made to them, this Salvation muſt ſtill be underſtood to compriſe no more in it, than the Benefits mentioned in the laſt Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph. To be ſure it is not ſuppoſed to imply the Grace of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration in it; which I take to be one of the moſt eminent Parts of the Salvation of ſinful Men.</p>
                  <p>Let us a little conſider how Juſtification, Adoption, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> may be ſaid to be offered on the Hypotheſis I oppoſe, where there is no Offer ſuppoſed to be made of the Grace of Regeneration. According to the Scheme oppoſed by me, the Offer of Forgiveneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> made to Sinners in the Goſpel, is made on Condition that Sinners believe on the Son of God; but the Faith in this Caſe required is ſuppoſed to be an Act of a regenerate Soul, and cannot be exerciſed by any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon 'till he is firſt <hi>born of the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>become a new Creature</hi>; which Grace the Sinner is not ſet in any certain Way to obtain: So that there is ſuppoſed to be an Offer of Salvation on a Condition which the Sinner is under a phyſical Impoſſibility of performing, 'till he be created anew, and this none can do for him, but God; and he does not on any Terms offer to do it, if the Doctrine I oppoſe be true. Such an Offer (if any ſuch there were) I confeſs, ſeems not to me to have any Kindneſs in it. If a rich Man ſhould offer a ſick Man to give him a fair and large Eſtate, on a Condition which none but a Man in Health can perform; and which the rich Man being a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, could only reſtore to him, but would not put him in a Way to recover, would the ſick Man in this Caſe think himſelf much obliged to him for ſuch an Offer, eſpecially if he never did the Thing for him? I think he could not have much Reaſon for it. Yea, I think that tho' there would be the Shew of an Offer, yet really there would be none.</p>
                  <p>If it be here ſaid, that Sinners are required to endeavour to believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and they do not know but that God may help them ſo to do; I deſire to know how an unregenerate Man may endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to believe in ſuch a Manner, as he is aſſured he is under a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Impoſſibility of doing. I have no Idea of a Way to try to do that which I have no Power to do any Thing towards, and a Thing
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:005439_0200_1018107f0f8ffa70"/>
in my preſent State utterly impoſſible for me to do. An unregenerate Man may pray to God to give him Grace to believe; and to do ſo is his preſent Duty; and I believe in his Power: But I would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed how an unregenerate Perſon ſhould try to do that which he is ſure he cannot? When our Saviour commanded the Man with the withered Hand, to ſtretch it forth, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.13. he did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him to do ſomething which he had no Power to do. The Meaning of the Command was, that he ſhould attempt to do it, <hi>i. e.</hi> by moving his Arm, or Parts contiguous to his Hand that was withe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which no Doubt the Man had a Power of doing; and if he had failed in his Attempt, he had not therein been diſobedient to Chriſt's Command. But I ſuppoſe the Command implied a Promiſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Aid, if Obedience to it were regularly endeavoured.</p>
                  <p>Thus, I think it evident, that the Goſpel being underſtood accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Suppoſition I am diſſatisfied with, is far from being plain and intelligible.</p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> let us conſider on the other Hand, whether on my Hypotheſis, the Offers of the Goſpel are not more plain and eaſy to be underſtood; and ſo better accommodated to the State of a ſinful World, to whom they are ſuppoſed to be made.</p>
                  <p>According as I explain the Goſpel of the Grace of God, the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation offered in it compriſes all that is neceſſary on God's Part, in order to the everlaſting Happineſs of thoſe, to whom the Grace of God is offered. God is willing <hi>to give Grace and Glory; and no good Thing will he withold</hi> from them who humbly ſeek him for his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Salvation he offers compriſes in it, not only the free Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of all our Sins, and the Juſtification of our Perſons in his Sight, thro' that moſt perfect and everlaſting Righteouſneſs, which Chriſt has already brought in, as in <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.24. a Righteouſneſs ready at Hand, to be imputed to all thoſe that believe in him who is the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it; and is actually imputed to all that ever have believed in him in the Manner which the Goſpel requireth; and ſhall be alſo imputed to as many as ſhall hereafter believe in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.23, 24. The Salvation offered does, I ſay, not only compriſe in it the Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of them that believe, by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt imputed to them; but alſo as a Conſequence of ſuch Imputation, the Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their Natures by the ſpecial Grace of God, reſtoring the Image of God, which by Reaſon of Sin we had loſt; and which could never be reſtored, were not Sinners firſt abſolved from their Guilt, as I have abundantly proved. In order to their receiving ſuch Benefits there is ſomething required of them, <hi>Namely,</hi> That they believe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:005439_0201_101832d34fb6b868"/>
and ſeek the Lord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which may not be underſtood of ſuch Actions, for Kind, as follow our Juſtification and Regeneration, but ſuch as, in Order of Nature, go before the ſame, as I have formerly ſhewed. And thus the Goſpel is plain and intelligible, and the Grace of God ſhining forth in it, very marvellous, God in it not requiring the Exerciſe of that Grace, which he does not give, but which Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners do receive from him; and which he requires them <hi>not to receive in vain,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.1.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. III. <hi>THE THIRD USE</hi> of the Doctrine inſiſted on, That it gives us a very pleaſant and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearing View and Proſpect of the unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd Love of God, in finding out, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and revealing ſuch a Way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as that made known in the Goſpel.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAVE proved, That there is a conditional Offer of Salvation made to Sinners in the Goſpel; that the Grace given in Regeneration, is compriſed in the Salvation offered; that, conſequently, that Grace cannot be contained or implied in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the new Covenant, or in the Terms on which God offers to ſave Sinners; that, therefore, theſe Terms are ſuch, that Men need not be regenerated or born a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, in order to their complying with them; but may, through the Grace of God granted to ſuch as are ſtill in an unregenerate State, be complied with; and that Sinners cannot, while they enjoy the Grace of God granted to them in and with the Goſpel, truly plead their ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Inability to comply with the moſt gracious Terms of the new Covenant.</p>
                  <p>And from theſe Things which I now take for granted, it plainly follows, that God does in the Goſpel put Sinners, to whom the Offer of it is made, on a <hi>new</hi> and <hi>ſecond Trial,</hi> on Terms in their Nature poſſible to be performed by them, in order to their eternal Happineſs;
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:005439_0202_101832d60f15dcb8"/>
ſo that if they again miſcarry, it is becauſe <hi>they will,</hi> and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have <hi>no Power</hi> to come to Jeſus Chriſt, our glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, for eternal Life and Salvation.</p>
                  <p>Now, what unparallel'd Love is this to ſelf-deſtroying Sinners, to whom God may truly ſay, as in Hoſea 13.9. <hi>Oh</hi> Iſrael, <hi>thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf; but in me is thine Help.</hi> This Love of God is very much celebrated in the holy Scriptures. Give me Leave to recite a few of the Paſſages wherein it is ſo. John 3.16. <hi>For God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting Life.</hi> 1 John 4.9, 10. <hi>In this was manifeſted the Love of God towards us, becauſe that God ſent his only begotten Son into the World, that we might live thro' him. Herein is Love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son to be the Propitiation for our Sins.</hi> 2 Cor. 5.18, 19, 20. <hi>God—hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, and hath given to us the Miniſtry of Reconciliation; to wit, that God was in Chriſt reconciling the World unto himſelf, not imputing their Treſpaſſes unto them; and hath committed unto us the Word of Reconciliation. Now then we are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as tho' God did beſeech you by us: We pray you in Chriſt's Stead, be ye reconciled unto God.</hi> Matth. 23.37. <hi>O</hi> Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem, <hi>thou that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them which are ſent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy Children together, even as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings, and ye would not!</hi> Rom. 24. <hi>Or deſpiſeſt thou the Riches of his Goodneſs, and Forbearance, and Long-ſuffering; not knowing that the Goodneſs of God leadeth thee to Repentance.</hi> Hoſea 11.4. <hi>I drew them with Cords of a Man, with Bands of Love; and I was to them as they that take off the Yoke on their Jaws; and I laid Meat before them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I am not aſhamed to ſay, (if I were I ſhould be aſhamed of the Goſpel of Chriſt, contrary to <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16.) that the Love of God thus manifeſted towards Sinners, has not a Relation to the Elect only, (tho' principally unto them) but extends it ſelf to the whole World, as in the mentioned <hi>John</hi> 3.16. and in 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.2. <hi>Mark</hi> 16.15, 16. and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. as I will, if I am put upon it, and God gives me Liberty, more fully ſhew.</p>
                  <p>They are greatly miſtaken who think that the Goodneſs and Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God towards Mankind appearing, is only to be diſcovered and judged of, by what does in the Event befall them, and not at all by the Nature and Tendency of what he does for them. If God affords unto Sinners ſuch Means and Aids as, according to the Nature of
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:005439_0203_101832d933ffeb90"/>
Things, are ſufficient to put them in a Way to obtain eternal Life, they uſing proper Endeavours to that End: He therein diſplays his Kindneſs and Good-will towards them, what ever the Iſſue be with Reſpect to them. Nor will God's fore-knowing that theſe or thoſe will neglect or miſimprove the Means and Advantages with which he favours them, alter the Nature of the Thing, and make them no Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, which otherwiſe would have been ſuch; if it would do ſo, it would be impoſſible that any ſhould receive real Benefit who finally periſh; for it is impoſſible that God ſhould not know how they will improve, or rather miſimprove them: And if God might not juſtly puniſh Sinners, either for not doing what they ſhould, or doing what they ſhould not, becauſe he fore-knew what they would do, and what they would not, it would follow, that he could never juſtly puniſh any for Sin, becauſe he could not be ignorant of what Men would do or omit, before ſuch Things were done or omitted.</p>
                  <p>Now ſince we muſt judge of the Goodneſs of God to Mankind, by the Nature and Tendency of what he does, and not only by what eventually befalls them, we muſt acknowledge the great Goodneſs of God unto Sinners, even to thoſe of them that ſhall at laſt periſh; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially this may be affirmed on the Hypotheſis I defend: And there is no Doubt but that God intends to gain unto himſelf a large Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of Glory, on the Account of what he does for them, who ſhall eternally periſh for their Sins, as well as for thoſe whom he will eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſave: And in the mean Time, thoſe who never will attain eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life, are bound to give Thanks and Praiſe to God, for putting them in a Way in which they may attain it, if the Fault be not their own.</p>
                  <p>And it is a great Sin in God's own People, if they do not confeſs to his Glory, that he deals very kindly by thoſe, who, thro' their own Fault and Negligence, fail of the Grace of God, and fall ſhort of eternal Life. The Obſtinacy and Unbelief of Sinners who deſpiſe his Goodneſs, and tread under Foot the Blood of his dear Son, whom he ſent to ſave them, ought not to make us think meanly of what he does for them; but we ſhould admire and magnify his Grace on the Account of it. And I confeſs I cannot but wonder that many who treat of the Kindneſs and Compaſſion of God towards periſhing Sinners, reſtrain all their Diſcourſe about it, to what he has done for the Elect, as if others were no Ways concerned in it; which the Scriptures ſeem not to do, as appears in the Texts laſt above quoted, and in many others beſide them, as in Iſai. 53.6. <hi>All we like Sheep have gone aſtray: We have turned every one to his own Way, and the Lord hath laid on him
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:005439_0204_101832dfa29dec58"/>
the Iniquity of us all.</hi> Hoſ. 13.9. 2 Pet. 3.9. <hi>The Lord is not ſlack concerning his Promiſe (as ſome Men count Slackneſs) but is long-ſuffering to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance.</hi> Can any poſſibly think that theſe Places and others like them, may be underſtood only of the Elect? and that particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Ezek. 18.31. <hi>Caſt away from you all your Tranſgreſſions whereby ye have tranſgreſſed, and make you a new Heart, and a new Spirit: For why will ye die, O Houſe of</hi> Iſrael.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F it be a Truth, as I think it evidently appears to be, That God has in his holy Word, made many conditional Promiſes to the Unregenerate, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing his ſpecial and eternal Mercies (the Grace of Regeneration not excepted) on all ſuch as do, in the Way by him appointed, ſeriouſly and diligently ſeek to him for them; what great Encouragement is there herein to ſuch convinced and awakened Sinners, to comply with the Method propoſed in the Goſpel, in order to their obtaining theſe Mercies? There be many of the ſinful Children of Men too inſenſible of their miſerable State by Nature; and theſe had need have the Terrors of the Lord ſet before them, leſt they ſhould remain inſenſible, and ſo never look out for a Remedy, but periſh in their Sins: But the Caſe is not ſo with all: There are ſome who have been bro't to a Sight of the woful State they are in by Nature; and thoſe need all the Encouragement to ſeek to God for Mercy, that can, according to the Tenor of the new Covenant, be given them.</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe it will not be denied, that Sinners in an unregenerate State, are ſometimes greatly awakened, and in ſome Sort humbled,

And now they deſire <hi>to flee from the Wrath to come</hi>; and it may be are convinced that they cannot be ſaved by any Righteouſneſs of their own; being ſenſible that in their preſent State of Sin and Death, they cannot perform any Actions truly holy; and that, if they could, they ſhould not thereby deſerve any Favour at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But all this nothwithſtanding, they are in a State of Nature ſtill, and have not yet <hi>attained the Faith of God's Elect,</hi> and the Remiſſion of their Sins: Or may we venture to tell them the <hi>Bitterneſs of Death is paſt with them,</hi> being already <hi>paſſed from Death to Life,</hi> and that <hi>there is no Condemnation for them,</hi> as <hi>being in Chriſt Jeſus?</hi> John 5.24. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. If we ſhould tell them ſo, they would be Fools if they believed us, without any better Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a State of Grace, than any Thing that is above expreſſed. However, it will be acknowledged, that theſe ought to be encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to ſeek to God in the Way of Duty and Well-doing, for his everlaſting Mercies, and in particular for the regenerating Influences of his holy Spirit.</p>
                  <p>And here the <hi>Queſtion</hi> is, What Encouragement may theſe have from the Word of God, to ſeek to him for the mentioned Favours? Now ſome muſt on their Principles ſay to them,
<q>God calls you to ſeek to him for his ſaving Grace, but has not, indeed, promiſed that he will grant you the Deſires of your Souls herein; but it may be he will do ſo; for he is very gracious and merciful, and does beſtow his Grace on many that ſeek to him for it; and you do not know but he may do ſo for you, as well as for others: Tho' it may be a Truth, that after all your Strivings and Seeking, you may fail of the Grace of God, and periſh for ever: But there is Room for you to hope, that God will beſtow his Grace upon you, if you diligently ſeek him for it, and perſevere in ſo doing: But however you cannot be ſure of this, there being no Promiſe of it in the Word of God.</q>

                  <head>CHAP. V. <hi>THE FIFTH USE.</hi> The Truth maintained in this Eſſay, takes from all thoſe who refuſe the great Salvation offered in the Goſpel, any Room to excuſe themſelves.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT Sinners who neglect their Duty, and the great Salvation offered to them in the Goſpel, are very apt to endeavour to <hi>excuſe themſelves</hi> in the Neglect whereof they are guilty, is too evident to need Time and Pains to be ſpent in the Proof of it. For Satisfaction as to this, we need only turn to the Parable of the great Supper, <hi>Luke</hi> 14.18,—23.</p>
                  <p>And ſo far as my Obſervation reacheth, there is Nothing by Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners more frequently pleaded as an Excuſe for their wicked Neglect of the Salvation offered, and Duties required of them; than their utter Inability to comply with the Terms of the Goſpel, and perform the Conditions of the new Covenant. They plead, that it is not in their Power to believe and repent, and to call upon God in a Manner acceptable to him: They ſay, that ſuch as are ſtill in an unregenerate State are wicked Perſons, and if they ſhould attempt it, all that they could do, would be an Abomination to the Lord, and would but provoke him. And indeed I know not very well how to anſwer ſuch Objections, on the Hypotheſis I oppoſe; for if all that it is poſſible for the Unregenerate to do, is, as we are taught, truly and properly Sin; and we do but provoke and offend the moſt High God in the beſt of our Actions, while we are in that State, it is not eaſy, if poſſible, for ſuch Sinners to ſee that their Attempts to ſeek the Lord, will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> to turn to their Advantage.</p>
                  <p>But now, if the Caſe be otherwiſe than is by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and even as I have maintained it to be, namely, That the Condition on which Salvation is offered to Sinners, does not conſiſt in any Act or Acts, to be performed by them after they are <hi>born of the Spirit,</hi> and <hi>become new Creatures</hi>; but in ſuch a Kind of Faith, Repentance, and
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:005439_0208_101832eb9bdc1868"/>
Seeking of God, as convinced and awakened Sinners, tho' unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, are capable of, during the Day of their Viſitation, while God is ſtriving with them by his Word and Spirit; then the ſeeming Strength of the Objection vaniſheth away, and there does not appear to be any Force in it at all.</p>
                  <p>For according to my Hypotheſis, thoſe who go about to excuſe their Unbelief and Impenitency, from a pretended utter Inability to do the Things required of them, ought to be told plainly, that this Plea of their's is utterly falſe, and that they ſpeak falſly in ſaying, that God in this requires of them what they are not able to perform. If it be ſaid, that they cannot do it without Help from God, I anſwer, that God does not require them to do it without Help from him: He actually affords them the Aids neceſſary in order to their beginning to do what he requires; and is ready to afford them more Help, if they need and deſire it. I doubt not but ſo much is intended in Jam. 4.8, 9, 10. <hi>Draw nigh unto God, and he will draw nigh unto you: Cleanſe your Hands, ye Sinners, and purify your Hearts, ye Double-minded. Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: Let your Laughter be turned into Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and your Joy into Heavineſs. Humble your ſelves in the Sight of the Lord, and he ſhall lift you up.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ye unregenerate Sinners, if ye ſay ye cannot do this, by the Help of that Grace which God either gives or offers you, ye <hi>belie the Lord,</hi> as the Phraſe is, <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.12. Our Lord upbraided the unbelieving Jews that they <hi>would not come to him, that they might have Life,</hi> John 5.40. They could, I acknowledge, have truly ſaid, that they could not do this unleſs God <hi>drew them</hi>; but they could not truly ſay, that God drew them not. <hi>He drew them with the Cords of a Man, and with the Bands of his Love,</hi> as in Hoſ. 10.4. <hi>The Goodneſs of God leadeth</hi> even thoſe <hi>unto Repentance,</hi> who <hi>after the Hardneſs and Impenitency of their Hearts, treaſure up unto themſelves Wrath againſt the Day of Wrath, and Revelation of the righteous Judgment of God,</hi> Rom. 2.4, 5.

                  <head>CHAP. VI. <hi>THE SIXTH USE.</hi> The Truth pleaded for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing allowed, does, without any Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to the <hi>calvinian</hi> Scheme, remove out of the Way the greateſt Difficulty that atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it; and renders it the more eaſy to be received and defended.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>N the Hypotheſis pleaded for in this Diſcourſe, I conceive ſome Grounds to hope for a better Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation of ſome of the Points in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, betwixt thoſe who are commonly called <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> and ſuch as are called <hi>Arminians</hi>: At leaſt I hope that if my Hypotheſis might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the Way would be thereby paved for the contending Parties to come to a better Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of ſome (at leaſt one) of the moſt important Articles contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted betwixt them; and this without the leaſt Damage to the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that Hypotheſis which <hi>Calviniſts</hi> endeavour to ſupport, againſt thoſe who are for the <hi>Arminian</hi> Scheme, in which we think ſome of the Doctrines of Grace are not well aſſerted.</p>
                  <p>Many of thoſe by whom ſeveral of the <hi>Arminian</hi> Doctrines ſeem to be ſomething favoured, appear to me to be Perſons of great Seriouſneſs; and I cannot think that the Oppoſition which they ſometimes make againſt ſome Things in the Scheme by <hi>Calviniſts</hi> pleaded for, ariſeth from an Enmity in their Hearts againſt the Grace of God; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, leſt while Men maintain the Sovereignty of God, in the Affair of Man's Salvation, in the Manner that many <hi>Calviniſts</hi> do, they ſhould thereby reflect ſome Diſhonour on the Attributes of his Juſtice and Holineſs, the doing of which they ſeem to dread. However, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it will be ſafeſt for us to be as charitable as may be, in our Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſuch Perſons; and that we take Care not to make the Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence more and greater than we need.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="195" facs="unknown:005439_0210_101832f3daa06800"/>Now, ſuppoſe the Hypotheſis which I have advanced and pleaded for, be a Truth, I hope our owning and allowing of it wou'd, as I have ſaid, render ſeveral other Things contained in the Scheme maintained by the Orthodox, the more eaſy to be admitted by ſuch as at preſent ſeem to be afraid to own and embrace them. And that I may make what I here ſay the more probable, I will give ſome Inſtances, in which I apprehend Things might prove as I hope and deſire they may.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe is the Caſe of <hi>Original Sin. Calviniſts</hi> generally maintain, that the Guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt and great Tranſgreſſion, has fallen on all his Poſterity; and that they are all thereby become na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally <hi>Children of Wrath,</hi> and <hi>Heirs of Death.</hi> They hold alſo, that on the Apoſtacy of our firſt Parents from God, they loſt his Image, in which they were created; and their Natures were ſo depraved, that they were thereby rendred uncapable of performing any Actions truly gracious and holy, and as ſuch acceptable to the Lord; and ſo were uncapable of Communion with him, and the Enjoyment of him, without the Pardon of Sin and renewing Grace. They alſo maintain that in this deplorable State all the Off-ſpring of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> are involved.</p>
                  <p>And hereupon they further affirm, that before Men's Regeneration, they are utterly uncapable to accept the Terms, or perform the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, required of Sinners in the Goſpel, in Order to their Salvation; becauſe they ſuppoſe the Goſpel in this Caſe requireth ſomething, the doing whereof ſuppoſeth Men firſt <hi>born again,</hi> and become <hi>new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures</hi>; which, they ſay, few ever attain to: Nor have Sinners any Offer of this Grace made to them. Now, if it be thus, thinks the Perſon inclining to <hi>Arminianiſm</hi>; (and who is there but by Nature is not inclined to Error?) if this be the Doctrine of <hi>original Sin,</hi> and the Conſequences following on it, I cannot, I will not receive it, 'till I can ſee ſuch Evidences for it, as will compel me to yield my Aſſent thereunto. And now ſcarce any Evidence will convince ſuch Perſons that a Doctrine is true, that is ſo hard to be digeſted.</p>
                  <p>But now let ſuch <hi>Diſſenters</hi> from the <hi>calvinian Doctrines</hi> be told, that the Doctrine of <hi>original Sin</hi> is indeed a great Truth; and that the ſame may be defended, being duly ſtated and underſtood; but that it is true alſo, that God had a Deſign of glorifying his Grace and Mercy, in the Redemption of Mankind when fallen into a State of Sin; and that for this End, God ſent his Son into the World ſo to die for all Men, that they might be ſaved on the Terms of a new
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:005439_0211_101832f766d80bc8"/>
Covenant, which Terms are not ſuch as they are not able to comply with, by the Help of God's Grace afforded to them, nor ſuch that they muſt be ſavingly converted or born again, before, and in order to, their Performance of them; but ſuch as thro' God's Help, by his Word and Spirit, they may come up to in their preſent State; and ſo obtain Deliverance from Sin and Death, if it be not their own Fault in refuſing the Mercies offered to them. If theſe Truths are owned and allowed, I think many People would not be ſo averſe to the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>original Sin</hi> as they now ſeem to be: For thus the Goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth a Remedy againſt it, to every Perſon afflicted with the Senſe of it, inaſmuch as it tells every Sinner how he may come to have his Nature renewed, and the Image of God reſtored in him; and that the Condition unto this End required of him, is not ſuch as a Perſon in a State of Nature cannot by God's Help perform.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Another Point which I here intend is that of <hi>Converſion</hi> or <hi>Regeneration</hi>: In this I think <hi>Calviniſts</hi> and <hi>Arminians</hi> differ greatly. <hi>Calviniſts</hi> (at leaſt many of them) hold, that true ſaving <hi>Converſion,</hi> which they alſo call <hi>Regeneration,</hi> is a great Change wrought in the Soul of a Sinner by the Spirit of God, whereby he has a new Blaſs or Diſpoſition given him. By this, according to them, the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſt Image of God is reſtored to a Sinner: Of <hi>carnal</hi> he is hereby made <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> having <hi>a new Heart given to him, and a new Spirit put within him,</hi> as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. And this they think is an <hi>inſtantaneous Change</hi>; and that the Soul is <hi>paſſive</hi> in it, having no Hand in the working of it; but that it is wholly a Work of God by his Holy Spirit, <hi>creating Men anew in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works,</hi> as in <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.10. <hi>John</hi> 3.8. and Chap. 1.13. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.19, 20. and many other Places.</p>
                  <p>Add hereunto, that, according to <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> Sinners can do no Actions that are ſpiritually good, or truly holy, 'till this Change be firſt wrought in them; and conſequently, it is impoſſible, (as they think) that any Sinner ſhould perform the Condition on which Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is offered to him, 'till he is firſt <hi>converted</hi> and <hi>born of the Spirit,</hi> as is above expreſſed. And they further think, (ſome of them at leaſt) that God has no where offered or promiſed in his Word, on any Condition whatſoever, that he will work ſuch a Change in any Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's Soul: And yet if any Sinner does not believe with ſuch a Kind of Faith as can only be exerciſed by one already ſo converted, he ſhall be more ſeverely puniſhed, than if he had never had any Offer of Salvation made to him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="197" facs="unknown:005439_0212_101832fa9a3dae90"/>Now thoſe who are inclined to <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> think this Doctrine is ſo harſh they cannot endure it: Nor does it ſeem to them any Way agreeable to the infinite Goodneſs and Mercy of God, made known and revealed in the Goſpel. And then ſuch ſeek to find ſome Flaws in the Doctrine mentioned; and what moſt readily offers it ſelf to their Mind is, that thoſe who thus hold are miſtaken with Reſpect to the Nature of Converſion; and that Converſion or Regeneration is no ſuch Thing, as they imagine it to be.</p>
                  <p>The Nature of Man (think they) is not ſo corrupted, as to need ſuch a mighty Work of the Spirit of God, in order to the changing of it. The Miniſtry of the Word, they think, and thoſe Motions and Convictions of God's Spirit, which he affords to Sinners under the Goſpel, are ſufficient to work all the Change in them that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to their eternal Happineſs: And what is talked of more than this, is a mere Fiction of ſome Men's Brains, and has no Foundation in the Word of God, on which it can be built.</p>
                  <p>But unto ſuch as theſe I ſay, according to my Hypotheſis, there is indeed a great Miſtake relating to the Matter under Conſideration; but it does not lye, as they imagine, in the Doctrine of <hi>Regeneration</hi> by <hi>Calviniſts</hi> maintained. Sinners need by Converſion or Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſuch a Change as they hold neceſſary. The Depravation of their Natures by <hi>original Sin,</hi> renders ſuch a Change indiſpenſibly needful, as our Saviour himſelf teacheth, <hi>John</hi> 3.3,—8. and as is in many other Places of Scripture manifeſted.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Miſtake</hi> lies in this, that it is not truly ſuppoſed and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that the Condition required of Sinners in the Goſpel, in order to their Salvation, is, that they believe and repent with a Kind of Faith and Repentance, of which no Sinner can be the Subject, who is not firſt <hi>born of God,</hi> and ſo <hi>a new Creature</hi>; and conſequently in a State of Salvation, before ever he exerciſeth ſuch Faith and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: When indeed, God's giving us that Grace whereof ſuch Faith and Repentance is the Fruit and Exerciſe, is his ſaving us; not that whereby we are enabled and diſpoſed to perform the Condition required of us. No: The Condition required of us, is, that we, <hi>wretched,</hi> and <hi>miſerable,</hi> and <hi>poor,</hi> and <hi>blind,</hi> and <hi>naked</hi> as we are, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our ſelves to Jeſus Chriſt, for <hi>Gold tried in the Fire,</hi> (true Grace) <hi>that we may be rich</hi>; for <hi>white Raiment,</hi> (his perfect Righteouſneſs) <hi>that we may be cloathed, and that the Shame of our Nakedneſs do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear</hi>; and for <hi>Eye-Salve, to anoint our Eyes, that we may ſee.</hi> We muſt not ſtay 'till we are renewed and ſanctified by the Spirit of God,
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:005439_0213_101832ff46ff1b70"/>
before we do this; but out of a Senſe of our Miſery, make Haſte to Chriſt to do it for us: And awakened Sinners may, by the Help of that <hi>Grace of God,</hi> which they ſhould <hi>not receive in vain,</hi> do thus. Tho' their Hearts are not yet changed by the Grace of Regeneration; yet they may go to him for that Grace. When God requires this of us, he requires not what is above our Power, and impoſſible for us, being furniſhed with that mentioned Grace of his, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. Tho' we cannot regenerate our ſelves, yet it is not true, that we cannot ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our ſelves to Chriſt to work this great Change in us by his Spirit. And he invites and requires us thus to do; and has promiſed, that if we do, he will not <hi>caſt us out,</hi> John 6.37.</p>
                  <p>Let this Doctrine be owned and preached among us, to awakened Sinners, tho' unſanctified, that we may thereby encourage them to lay hold on God's Mercy; and it is poſſible <hi>Arminians</hi> may then think, that they have far leſs to cavil againſt in our Doctrine of <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi> than they ſhould have if this were denied. I am in Hopes, that if this Truth were duly acknowledged, ſuch as are diſpoſed to <hi>Arminianiſm</hi> among us, would be more inclined to receive our Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, in ſuch Articles of it as are indeed eſſential to it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There is one Point more, which is very eſſential to the Scheme which I have endeavoured to explain and confirm; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing allowed, and clearly aſſerted among us, would have a great Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to gain over to us ſuch as lean towards <hi>Arminianiſm</hi>; and make them more favourably inclined towards our Doctrine: And this is, That <hi>God does not either by his Decree, or the Execution of it, lay a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity on any of his Creatures to ſin againſt him.</hi> This is one of the Things, about which the <hi>Arminians</hi> contend very earneſtly with <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts,</hi> with Relation to our Doctrine: And tho' much of what they ſay on this Head, is, if I miſtake not, very unjuſt; yet on the other Hand, I am of Opinion that ſome <hi>Calviniſts</hi> have ſaid Things with Reſpect to God's Decree, which have given too much Occaſion of Offence to thoſe who differ in Judgment from them. If it were granted on our Part, (1) That God does neither in his Decree, nor in the Execution of it, take away the Liberty of free Agents, ſuch as Men and Angels are. (2) That when it is ſaid, that God <hi>wills</hi> or <hi>decrees</hi> the Actions of ſinful Men, this muſt not be underſtood of an <hi>effective</hi> Decree, but <hi>permiſſive</hi> only: The Nature of divine Permiſſion being rightly underſtood. (3) That by that efficiency of God, whereby he executeth his Decree, he does not by any Action of his, lay his Creatures under a Neceſſity of doing Actions wherein they ſin againſt him: The Concourſe of the firſt Cauſe with the ſecond, does
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:005439_0214_10183300d61244c0"/>
not infer this. If theſe Things were well aſſerted and explained, it would, I think, tend much to quiet the Minds of ſuch as are apt to be ſtumbled at the Doctrine of <hi>Calviniſts</hi> about them.</p>
                  <p>What I have briefly ſaid of ſuch a Tendency, in this Eſſay, is not only deſigned as a Teſtimony to the Truth; but as what I hope, if allowed to be agreeable thereunto, might in ſome Meaſure ſerve to quiet the tumultuating Thoughts of thoſe who have entertained ſuch an Opinion of the Doctrine of God's Decree and Providence, as does not become the infinite Perfections of his Nature; and who are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at ſuch as maintain the Truth in theſe Points.</p>

                  <head>CHAP. VII. <hi>THE SEVENTH USE</hi> of the Doctrine pleaded for. An Exhortation, with Directions, to ſuch as are yet in a State of Nature, to comply with the Terms on which Salvation is offered to them in the Goſpel.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>O encourage Sinners to endeavour that which they are now exhorted to, has been the principal End at which I have aimed in the doctrinal Part of this Eſſay: And in order hereunto, I think I have plainly ſhewed, that even the Grace of Regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it ſelf is compriſed in the Salvation offered; and conſequently not included nor implied in the Condition on which the Offer is made, nor neceſſary in order to a Compliance with it; ſo that for Want of it, Sinners ſhould have no Power to comply with the Terms of the new Covenant.</p>
                  <p>It therefore now only remains incumbent on me, that I endeavour to perſuade ſuch as are ſtill in a State of Nature, unregenerate and unjuſtified, to endeavour to comply with the Terms on which God offers to ſave them, <hi>i. e.</hi> to juſtify and regenerate them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If God offers ſuch a Salvation to Sinners in a conditional Covenant, as I have well proved he does, they have no Reaſon to expect it in
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:005439_0215_101833026328cb20"/>
any other Way, than in that in which it is thus offered to them. It muſt needs, therefore, be a Matter of vaſt Importance, that thoſe, unto whom this Offer is made, do comply with the Terms or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions on which Salvation is thus offered to them.</p>
                  <p>That there are in the World many ſuch as this Exhortation is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to, is too evident. There are Multitudes whoſe irreligious and unholy Lives ſhew them to be of this Number. And beſides this, Men may have gone far in the Profeſſion of Religion, and in the Practice of the external Duties of it; and yet have not hitherto ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled the Conditions of the new Covenant, nor obtained a Right and Title to the Benefits of it; and if they ſhall never do this, they will be exceeding miſerable, and that for ever.</p>
                  <p>But the Miſery of ſuch both in Reſpect of Loſs and Senſe, is not what I intend here to enlarge upon, this being very well done by many others.</p>
                  <p>What I here intend, is to offer ſome Things by Way of Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Direction to thoſe unto whom this Part of my Diſcourſe is directed. Unto ſuch I then ſay what here follows.</p>
                  <p>DIRECTION I.</p>
                  <p>Conſider well what a miſerable State you are in before, and until, you have complied with the Terms of the new Covenant. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtified and an unregenerate State, is a very miſerable State indeed. Such, whatever outward Privileges they may enjoy, are ſtill in a State of Condemnation; and <hi>the Wrath of God abideth on them,</hi> John 3.18. and Verſe 36. Such are alſo unſanctified and unholy; and ſo uncapable of the Enjoyment of God, and ſuch Communion with him as true Saints may enjoy, either in this Life or that to come; and are liable to the Torments of the Damned, to be ſuffered in Hell to all Eternity. If you are ſtill in a State of Nature, this is your Caſe; and it is neceſſary that you ſhould be ſenſible of it; for if you will not apply your ſelves in good Earneſt to work out your own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor endeavour to perform the Condition of the new Covenant, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> indeed ſo much as enquire <hi>what you ſhall do to be ſaved,</hi> as they did <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. and he in <hi>Acts</hi> 16.30. you muſt miſerably periſh for ever.</p>
                  <p>Such therefore as are ſtill in an unregenerate State, ſhould meditate Terror, as in <hi>Iſai.</hi> 33.18. They ſhould conſider the Juſtice and Holineſs of God, the Strictneſs of his Law, his perfect Knowledge of all that Men do, the Judgment to come, the Puniſhment that will be inflicted on all ſuch as die in their Sins; and that this will be the
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:005439_0216_1018330723b670d8"/>
woful Caſe of all that comply not with the Terms of the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. By ſuch Conſiderations they ſhould endeavour to get a deep Senſe of their miſerable State by Nature: For while Men ſay they are <hi>rich, and increaſed in Goods, and have need of Nothing; and know not that they are wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked,</hi> as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.17. they will never follow the Advice given them in the next Words, Verſe 18. <hi>I counſel thee to buy of me Gold tried in the Fire, that thou mayſt be rich; and white Raiment, that thou mayſt be clothed, and that the Shame of thy Nakedneſs do not appear; and anoint thine Eyes with Eye-Salve, that thou mayſt ſee</hi>: For <hi>they that are whole, need not the Phyſician, but they that are ſick,</hi> Matth. 9.12.</p>
                  <p>DIRECTION II. Conſider well, and rightly underſtand, what it is that God requires of you, in order to your Salvation. Take heed leſt you be miſtaken in the <hi>Terms</hi> of the new Covenant. If you are miſtaken in this, the Miſtake may be fatal to you. There are here two Ways in which Perſons may be miſtaken to their own Hurt. As (1) by thinking the Terms ſo low, that Perſons may attain to, and perform what they think is required, and yet never be ſaved: As when Perſons think an external Reformation will anſwer the End, without any Heart-Reformation; and ſo have no Regard to the <hi>inner Man,</hi> but content themſelves with ſuch an Amendment of their Lives, that Men cannot accuſe them; but take no Care to do what is required in Jer. 4.14. <hi>O</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>waſh thine Heart from Wickedneſs, that thou mayſt be ſaved: How long ſhall thy vain Thoughts lodge within thee!</hi> And Ezek. 18.31. —<hi>Make you a new Heart, and a new Spirit; for why will ye die, O Houſe of</hi> Iſrael! Joel 2.13. <hi>Rent your Hearts, and not your Garments; and turn to the Lord thy God</hi>—. Obſerve that here is Heart-Humiliation and Reformation required; yet I do not think that Sinners in theſe and ſuch like Texts, are required to regenerate themſelves; which never any Sinner did or will do. There is a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the Heart which is a Work very much ſhort of, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the great Work of Regeneration, which God only can work. Sinners may very much reform and amend their own Hearts, as well as their external Actions. Such as pleaſe may for this ſee the Supplement to Mr. POOL's Engliſh Notes, on the mentioned <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.31. There is ſuch a Thing as a <hi>moral</hi> as well as a <hi>gracious</hi> Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity; and the <hi>former</hi> of theſe God requires Sinners, by the Help of his common Grace, to work upon their own Hearts, but not the <hi>latter: This</hi> he reſerves to himſelf as his own Prerogative, as appears in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19. and 36.26. Wherefore (2) Perſons may alſo wrong themſelves greatly, by ſuppoſing <hi>that</hi> to be required of them which is not. If Sinners ſuppoſe, that God requires of them, as the
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:005439_0217_1018330bcf487da8"/>
Condition of his Covenant, that which no Sinner ever did, or can do; no, not by Grace received from God himſelf, it is no wonder if they are diſcouraged, and never attempt this.</p>
                  <p>And here I will mention two Things which I ſuppoſe God never required of any Sinner, in order to his Salvation. As (1) God never required any Sinner to <hi>regenerate</hi> himſelf. I do not underſtand that God requires Men themſelves to work that great Change which is wrought in Men's Regeneration; or ſo much as to have any Hand in it. <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> I think, generally own, that in this the Soul is wholly <hi>paſſive</hi>; and I cannot but underſtand the Scripture to ſpeak of it as ſuch a Work, in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 11.19. and 36.26. before mentioned; alſo Jer. 31.18. <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned</hi>; and this is ſpoken of as the Effect of the mighty Power of God, in the Texts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore quoted. This therefore is a Work which I cannot think God requires Sinners themſelves to perform. (2) I do not think that God requires Sinners to <hi>exerciſe ſaving Grace,</hi> while they have it not. One of my Reaſons, is, becauſe this is phyſically impoſſible; as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible as it is for a Man void of natural Life, to act and move him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Another Reaſon of this may be, that it ſeems to imply a plain Contradiction, as much as it is for a Perſon to <hi>ſee</hi> while he is <hi>blind.</hi> If God gives a Man Grace, he can exerciſe it, but he cannot be enabled to exerciſe Grace while he has it not: Neither does God require this of any Man living. Man's preſent Duty, while unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, is not to exerciſe that Kind of Grace which he is without; but to wait on God in the Uſe of Means for the obtaining of it; attending the Ordinances inſtituted by him for that End, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the Duties unto that End demanded of him, as hearing and reading his Word, meditating on it, and calling on him for his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on the Means of Grace, and praying earneſtly to him for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of his Sins, for Chriſt's Sake, and to give him his Holy Spirit in the converting and ſaving Influences of it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now theſe are Duties which Perſons by the Help of common Grace may perform.</p>
                  <p>DIRECTION III. Conſider well, and underſtand, how very difficult the Conditions required are to be performed. Tho' I ſuppoſe theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions may be complied with, by the Help of common Grace, by Perſons not yet born of the Spirit; becauſe if theſe Conditions are complied with by any, it muſt be in order to their Regeneration; and ſo before, not after, that Work is wrought in them. Tho' therefore I affirm, that theſe Conditions are not ſuch as the Unregenerate cannot, by the Help of common Grace, perform; yet I by no Means ſay, that the Conditions required in order to their Salvation, and conſequently in order to their Regeneration, are ſuch as may by them be eaſily
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:005439_0218_1018107642b21428"/>
complied with, while they are in a State of Nature. Even thoſe Duties which unregenerate Perſons can, by the Help of common Grace, perform, and muſt perform, if they would be ſaved, are very contrary to Fleſh and Blood, and difficult to be performed by them. That Corruption which they have in them, greatly diſinclines them to the Performance of them. They do not find their Hearts well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to read the Word of God, hear it preached, and meditate on it; and to examine themſelves, and pray earneſtly to God for the convincing and converting Influences of his Holy Spirit, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Tho' Men may poſſibly do theſe Things by ſuch Help as the Unregenerate may receive; yet this is to them hard Work: There is a hard Striving required to it, and great Self-Denial in it. Even in ſuch Actions of the Unregenerate, there is a <hi>Wreſtling with Fleſh and Blood,</hi> and <hi>againſt Principalities,</hi> and <hi>Powers,</hi> and <hi>againſt the Rulers of the Darkneſs of this World,</hi> and <hi>againſt ſpiritual Wickedneſs in high Places,</hi> Eph. 6.12. Which Words I think may be underſtood not of the Regenerate only, but of the Unregenerate alſo, when awakened, and excited to begin to <hi>work out their own Salvation</hi>; and to begin to <hi>preſs into</hi> (or towards) <hi>the Kingdom of God,</hi> Luke 16.16. and to <hi>ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait Gate,</hi> Luke 13.24. The Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven muſt be taken by <hi>Violence</hi> by ſuch as would enjoy it; and this Violence muſt be uſed in order to Men's obtaining; not after they have it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.12. <hi>Striving to enter</hi> into it, is in order to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance; not after Perſons are in it. <hi>The ſtrait Gate</hi> and <hi>the narrow Way</hi> muſt be found, entred into, and walked in, before we enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Life, and in order to it; and not only after we have obtained it. Nor does the Difficulty of this conſiſt in the Work of Regeneration it ſelf, which Men themſelves have no Hand in, it being wholly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by God for them; but in the Duties that are preparatory to it.</p>
                  <p>It is dangerous for Perſons in an unregenerate State, to think the Duties and Conditions eaſy, which are required of them in order to their Salvation; for this tends to make them ſlighty and careleſs about them, and to occaſion their delaying to perform them.</p>
                  <p>DIRECTION IV. You muſt confeſs, and be very ſenſible, that there is nothing of Merit in any Thing required of you, or that can be done by you, in order to your Salvation. It is moſt evident, that the Conditions required in a Covenant of Grace, can have Nothing of Merit in them. Even the Condition of the Covenant of Works had Nothing of Merit in it, much leſs can the Condition of the Covenant of Grace have any Merit in that. Indeed, if Grace were given according to Works, that would, according to the Language of the Scriptures, and good
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:005439_0219_10183310984e6598"/>
Divines, be according to Merit; and then it would not be <hi>of Grace,</hi> but <hi>of Debt,</hi> as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.6. But muſt this be the Caſe, if any Conditions are required in the Covenant of Grace? Will it then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that his Salvation is <hi>of Debt,</hi> and not of Grace? This cannot be allowed, and has been ſufficiently diſproved in Part I. Chap. III. and Part II. Chap. XVII. A Thing may be not at all the leſs <hi>of Grace,</hi> becauſe it is given in the Way of a Covenant, on ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to be performed by him that ſhall receive it. When Sinners are required to ſeek the Lord for his Grace and Mercy, thro' the Merits of his dear Son, who has obeyed the Law, and ſuffered the Penalty of it for them, there is not the leaſt Room for them to imagine they can by this merit any Thing at his Hands. Repentance for Sins committed, believing in a Redeemer for Righteouſneſs and Life, and begging Pardon, have no Appearance of Merit in them. Let not unconverted Sinners think they merit any Thing at God's Hands, when they do this. I am ſure they have no Reaſon for it. Let them, on the contrary, plead with God the Riches and Freedom of his Grace, and the Merits of his Son, when they are ſeeking to him for his ſpiritual Bleſſings and everlaſting Mercies, and that will be the Way to obtain them.</p>
                  <p>DIRECTION V. Take heed you do not, by living in the Practice of any known Sin, provoke God to deny or withold his ſpecial and everlaſting Mercies from you. Sinners have no Reaſon to expect that God will par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don their Iniquities, and ſanctify their Hearts by his Holy Spirit, ſo long as they indulge themſelves in any known Sin, either of Omiſſion or Commiſſion. <hi>Paul</hi> was indeed very ſuddenly converted: He was going on in an evil Way, <hi>Acts</hi> Chap. 9. But he himſelf declares, he <hi>obtained Mercy becauſe he did it ignorantly,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.13. Nor was his ſaving Converſion (I am perſuaded) ſo very ſudden that there was no preparatory Work going before it, tho' but of ſhort Continuance. That Out-cry of his, when trembling and aſtoniſhed he ſaid, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> was, I ſuppoſe, of the ſame Kind with their's, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. and his Chap. 16.30. Compare thoſe Scriptures and ſee how much the Paſſages are alike. I think it is very probable he was then born both of Water and of the Spirit, when <hi>Ananias</hi> bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized him, ſaying to him, as in Acts 9.17. <hi>Brother</hi> Saul, <hi>the Lord, (even Jeſus that appeared unto thee in the Way as thou cameſt) hath ſent me, that thou mighteſt receive thy Sight, and be filled with the holy Ghoſt.</hi> After which Words, it followeth, Verſe 18. <hi>And immediately there fell from his Eyes, as it had been Scales; and he received Sight forthwith, and aroſe and was baptized.</hi> Men muſt firſt <hi>turn at God's Reproof,</hi> before they may expect that he will <hi>pour out his Spirit unto them, and make known his
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:005439_0220_10183316864de058"/>
Words unto them,</hi> as in Prov. 1.23. If we have <hi>exceeding great and precious Promiſes, by which we may be Partakers of the divine Nature,</hi> we may not expect to receive this Benefit, till we have <hi>firſt eſcaped the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption that is in the World thro' Luſt,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. They are miſtaken who think, God's ordinary Way is firſt to <hi>regenerate</hi> Men, and by that Means to <hi>reform</hi> their vicious Lives. God's Way is the Reverſe of this: He firſt humbles and reforms Sinners, and then pours out his Spirit on them, and ſavingly converts them. They muſt not live in ſuch abominable Practices, as are mentioned in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.9. if they deſign to ſee or get into the Kingdom of God, by obtaining true and ſaving Grace, as in <hi>Mark</hi> 12.34.</p>
                  <p>DIRECTION VI. Delay not your Repentance till it be too late: I mean, 'till it is too late for you to repent, or 'till your Seaſon for it be paſt and gone. Now there are two Caſes in which this may befall you, <hi>viz.</hi> (1) Death may overtake you while you delay it, and then you have loſt your Opportunity for it for ever! Oh! take heed of this. Remember that awful Word in Prov. 27.1. <hi>Boaſt not thy ſelf of To-morrow; for thou knoweſt not what a Day may bring forth.</hi> And forget not that of the Apoſtle, James 4.14. <hi>Ye know not what ſhall be on the Morrow: For what is your Life? It is even a Vapour that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth for a little Time, and then vaniſheth away.</hi> Tremble at the Tho't of that in Prov. 29.1. <hi>He that being often reproved, hardneth his Neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without Remedy.</hi> Think ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly what Multitudes there are now roaring in Hell, becauſe they wickedly delayed their Repentance, till Death overtook them; and that after Death there is no Seaſon for Repentance unto Life. Be perſuaded to do as <hi>David</hi> did, Pſal. 119.59, 60. <hi>I tho't on my Ways and turned my Feet into thy Teſtimonies. I made Haſte, and delayed not to keep thy Commandments.</hi> (2) The holy Spirit may be finally taken from you, if you continue long to reſiſt him, and quench his Motions, by an obſtinate delaying of your Repentance; and then you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done for ever. It will therefore be your Duty and Intereſt, ſeriouſly to conſider ſuch Texts of Scripture as hold forth the Danger of his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forſaking you, leſt he forever leave you. To this End, ponder and lay to Heart, what we have in Gen. 6.3. <hi>My Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with Man.</hi> Pſal. 81.11, 12. <hi>My People would not hearken to my Voice, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>would none of me. So I gave them up to their own Heart's Luſts; and they walked in their own Counſels.</hi> Ezek. 24.13. <hi>Becauſe I have purged thee, and thou waſt not purged, thou ſhalt not be purged any more, 'till I have cauſed my Fury to reſt upon thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="206" facs="unknown:005439_0221_101833187b1a5730"/>DIRECTION VII. Perſevere in well doing, when you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun well; and take heed of Apoſtacy. Some begin well, but fall away and loſe all they have done. This is the ſad Caſe ſuppoſed in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. and in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20, 21, 22. alſo in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.24, 26. And I doubt not alſo in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.38, 39. Nor is this a Suppoſition of what never falls out: There be many to whom it may be truly ſaid, as in <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.4. <hi>Ye are fallen from Grace</hi>: And this not only on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of fundamental Errors in Doctrine, which they embrace; but alſo in Reſpect of abominable Practices into which they fall, and in which they continue, as in the mentioned Text, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. Not that regenerate and juſtified Perſons ever do thus, or are liable to it; for theſe are all <hi>kept by the Power of God, thro' Faith unto Salvation,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.5. They are become <hi>Pillars in the Temple of God, and ſhall go no more out,</hi> Rev. 3.12. I cannot believe, that the Suppoſitions of Apoſtacy which we have in Scripture, relate to the Regenerate, who are expreſly ſecured againſt it; but to thoſe, on whom a Work of common Grace only has been wro't, and ſo are liable to fall away: And ſuch had need beware, leſt <hi>being led away by the Error of the Wicked, they fall from their own Stedfaſtneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 3.17 At leaſt, I think that this may be accommodated to the Condition of the Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, under a Work preparatory to Regeneration, and muſt be ſo, if a total Apoſtacy be intended. It is certain that many Profeſſors of Religion have totally fallen away, after great Convictions and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation. Nor is the Promiſe of Salvation made to any Meaſure of ſuch Grace as the Unregenerate have; but to ſuch as perſevere in that Way of well-doing, which ſome who are not ſavingly converted, are engaged in, as I think I have ſufficiently ſhewed, Part II. Chap. XIV. To ſuch I ſay, as in Heb. 10.35, 36. <hi>Caſt not away therefore your Confidence, which hath great Recompence of Reward. For ye have need of Patience, that after ye have done the Will of God, ye might receive the Promiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>DIRECTION VIII. Rely on the free and ſovereign Grace of God, to make you willing to attend the Duties required of you, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to your Salvation. Acknowledge alſo, that your doing ſo depends abſolutely on his Good-will and Pleaſure. Tho' God has promiſed that he will ſave you, if you perform what is to that End required of you; yet he has made no Promiſe to you, that you ſhall perform the Condition on which Salvation is offered to you. Whether he will effectually incline your Hearts to this, is abſolutely at his Liberty. It is not conſiſtent with the Nature of a conditional Promiſe, that he that propoſeth it ſhould engage himſelf to the Perſon unto whom it is made, for both the Condition required, and the Promiſe made on that

Condition. To ſuppoſe, that in the conditional Promiſe of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, God promiſeth Sinners both theſe, is a plain Contradiction. Tho' I cannot tell you, that if you fail or fall ſhort of the Grace of God, the Reaſon is, becauſe you have no Power to comply with the Terms of the new Covenant; yet I can tell you, that your doing this depends abſolutely on God's free and ſovereign Grace; who, if ever you are ſaved, muſt <hi>work in you both to will and to do, according to his own good Will and Pleaſure.</hi> Here that is applicable, Rom. 9.16. <hi>So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth Mercy.</hi> Perſons may have Power to comply with the Terms of the new Covenant, and yet never do it. There is a great deal more to be done for a Sinner in order to his Salvation, than the bare giving him ſuch a Power; even an effectual Perſuaſion to do the Things required of him; which tho' he has Power to perform, yet he never would without ſuch Perſuaſion. Let therefore every unregenerate Sinner humbly and freely confeſs, that after all that God has hitherto done for him, he ſhall miſerably periſh, and that for ever, if he does not, in his infinite Mercy, effectually perſuade him to do what is incumbent on him in order to his eternal Happineſs. And I do moſt freely &amp; heartily ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledge, that a Soul that is bro't to this, is in the moſt likely Way to obtain ſaving Grace and Mercy; and ſuch an one ſeems not to be far from the Kingdom of God. If ſome believe and are ſaved, when o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers neglect the Salvation offered to them, and eternally periſh, a ſovereign God muſt have the Glory of <hi>making the Difference</hi>: Thoſe who believe and are ſaved, would have done no more than thoſe who remain Unbelievers and are damned, if God did no more for them. And we may to this Caſe apply thoſe Words of our glorious Lord, with very little Variation, Matth. 11.25, 26. <hi>I thank thee, O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Lord of Heaven and Earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe Things from the Wiſe and Prudent, and haſt revealed them unto Babes. Even ſo, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy Sight.</hi> It muſt be ſo, and it is beſt it ſhould be ſo: It is for our Intereſt to acknowledge it, and that our Hearts ſhould acquieſce in it, and to it ſay, AMEN.</p>
                  <p>DIRECTION IX. While you ſeek to God for his Salvation, rely on his Mercy, &amp; on the Merits of his dear Son; and plead with him his Promiſes of ſaving all ſuch as diligently ſeek him. They are not only the Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate and Juſtified that may do this: Thoſe who have not yet ſecured the Salvation of their own Souls, are bound ſo to do; and it is not impoſſible that they ſhould. They cannot indeed do this in that gracious and holy Manner, that Perſons already in a State of Grace can; but that they cannot do it at all, is not to be allowed. The Unregenerate may have a Hope and Truſt in God, anſwerable to that Perſuaſion of

his Power and Mercy, which by Means of the glorious Goſpel, they have attained to. If this were not ſo, how ſhould they wait on God in the Uſe of Means, for the Salvation of their Souls? which many unregenerate Perſons do. Such may alſo plead with God the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Promiſes of his Covenant, made to ſuch as diligently ſeek him: Such as we have in <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.7,—11. <hi>Luke</hi> 11.9,—13. <hi>Prov.</hi> 23, 4, 5. And unto awakened unregenerate Souls, I ſay, Do not think it impoſſible to do this, by the Help of God's Grace, before you are born of the Spirit, or ſavingly converted, and while your Day of Grace laſteth, and God is by his Word and Spirit ſtriving with you. Let the Promiſes God has made encourage you to do ſo: <hi>For he has not ſaid to the Seed of</hi> Jacob, (of which many are unconverted) <hi>ſeek ye me in vain:</hi> Therefore <hi>ſeek the Lord while he may be found</hi>—Iſai. 55.6. Let nothing diſcourage you from endeavouring to do ſo: And while you are thus <hi>drawing nigh unto God, he will draw nigh unto you,</hi> James 4.8. Truſt in God, and he will not fail you. Pſal. 34.8. <hi>O taſte and ſee that the Lord is good: Bleſſed is the Man that putteth his Truſt in him.</hi>
