         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A LETTER, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IN Times of publick Danger, every Man has a Right to offer his Advice; there are ſome Men who think it their Duty to do it, although on common Occaſions they may be naturally too diffident of their own Opinions, or too indolent, to give themſelves the Trouble to obtrude them on the World. If ſuch Men happen to miſtake their Talents, not from Vanity but from an Exceſs of Zeal, and meddle officiouſly with Matters above their Reach, they may be forgiven on the Score of their Intention: Even a modeſt Man is apt to over-rate his own Judgment where his Affections and Intereſts are deeply concerned.</p>
            <p>MY Zeal therefore in the common Cauſe muſt ſerve for my Excuſe, if in the Courſe of this Letter I ſhould give my Opinion more confidently than I ought to do, and ſeem to think myſelf, which is a very common Caſe, much wiſer than I am.</p>
            <p>YOU are ſoon to meet on the moſt ſerious Occaſion that ever preſented itſelf to this Country ſince its Exiſtence.</p>
            <p>THE Harmony which ſubſiſted, with little or no Interruption, between Great-Britain and her Colonies, from their very Infancy until of late, is in Danger of being deſtroyed for ever. The Habits of Kindneſs and Affection, on one Side, and of Reſpect and Obedience, on the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013167_0003_0F8EC6F8E17C3460"/>
other, (which prevailed during ſo long a Period, were in the higheſt Degree conducive to the Proſperity of this Country in particular, and are ſtill neceſſary to its Security and Happineſs) are changed into Murmurings, Diſcontents, and Reproaches; and will ſoon end, without ſome very extraordinary Interpoſition, in mutual and implacable Hatred. Complaints of Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, real or imaginary, are heard from one End of theſe Colonies to the other; the Minds of the People appear to be agitated as at ſome great Criſis; they wiſh, by a publick Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, to be aſſured of the general Opinion, by a Repreſentation of every Province, to collect the calm, deliberate Determination of all the Provinces, to eſtabliſh ſome publick Mark of mutual Confidence, that they may hold it up to the Parent Country, in all its Weight and Importance. For this Purpoſe, Gentlemen, you are delegated to the Congreſs. An abſolute, perfect Repreſentation of the People, never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted perhaps, but in Theory. You, it is true, have not been ſummoned, or convened, by any formal conſtitutional Authority, or inveſted with any legiſlative Powers: But you have been cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen as freely as the Circumſtances of the Times would admit; with leſs Cabal and Intrigue than is uſually employed for a Seat in many of our legal provincial Aſſemblies, and without even the Suſpicion of Venality, which is but too frequently and too generally practiſed among us for that Purpoſe. Your Perſons, Characters, and Principles, are familiarly known to your
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013167_0004_0F8EC6F9C29D5790"/>
Conſtituents; you have been recommended by the moſt Honourable of all Intereſts, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Opinion of your Knowledge, Abilities and Virtues. We look up to you as the Oracles of our Country; your Opinions will have the Effect of Laws, on the Minds of the People, and your Reſolves may decide the Fate of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica. All Orders of Men, who enjoy the Happineſs of living under a free Government, may boldly aſſume the Character of Politicians; they inherit a Right to it as much as the proudeſt Peer inherits a Right to his Seat in Parliament, however ridiculous the Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may appear to the Conceit and Arrogance of Men who think themſelves born to domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neer over their fellow Creatures at Pleaſure. High Birth and Fortune, when they are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed, confer the ſolid and ſplendid Advantages of Education and Accompliſhments, extenſive Influence, and incitement to Glory; but they give no excluſive Title to Common Senſe, Wiſdom, or Integrity. The loweſt Orders of Men in ſuch a Country, have an unalienable Property in their Induſtry, their Liberty, and their Lives, and may be allowed to ſet ſome Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue at leaſt on the only Property they can boaſt of: Theſe may be all endanger'd, or loſt, by the Conduct of their Governors, they have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Right, as Freemen, to examine their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, to cenſure, to condemn it; without this Right the freeſt Government on Earth would ſoon degenerate into the rankeſt Tyranny. The great Out-lines, the fundamental Principles of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013167_0005_0F8EC6FA6E366DD8"/>
out Conſtitution, are within the Reach of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every Man's Capacity; they require little more than Leiſure to ſtudy them, Memory to retain them, and Candour to form a true Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them; unhappily for the Order and Peace of Society, this ineſtimable Privilege is but too often abuſed. Men in general are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd more by their Temper than their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; they have little Leiſure and ſtill leſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, to inform themſelves exactly of the neceſſary conſtitutional Powers of the ſupreme Magiſtrate, or of their own legal Rights; they have been often told that Liberty is a very great Bleſſing; they talk inceſſantly of it, they find ſomething inchanting in the very Sound of the Word; aſk them the Meaning of it, they think you deſign to affront them; puſh them to a Definition, they give you at once a Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the State of Nature. Their Ideas of the Nature, Origin and Conditions of civil Society in general, are juſt as confus'd and inaccurate; they take their political as they do their religious Opinions (upon Truſt) from the Nurſery, the Company they fall into, or the Profeſſions and Scenes in which they are accidentally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged. They find the Movement of the Paſſions a more eaſy and agreeable Exerciſe than the Drudgery of ſober and diſpaſſionate Enquiry. Hand Bills, News Papers, party Pamphlets, are the ſhallow and turbid Sources from whence they derive their Notions of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; theſe they pronounce as confidently and dogmatically, as if a political Problem
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013167_0006_0F8EC6FB8DB19998"/>
was to be ſolved as clearly as a Mathematical one; and as if a bold Aſſertion amounted to a Demonſtration.</p>
            <p>AMBITION and Luſt of Power above the Laws, are ſuch predominant Paſſions in the Breaſts of moſt Men, even of Men who eſcape the Infection of other Vices, that Liberty, legal Liberty, would be in continual Danger of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments, if it were not guarded by perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Jealouſy. Crafty deſigning Knaves, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent Demagogues, Quacks in Politics, and Impoſtors in Patriotiſm, have in all free Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and in all Ages, avail'd themſelves of this neceſſary Spirit of Jealouſy; and by broaching Doctrines unknown to the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, under the Name of conſtitutional Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, by bold Aſſertions, partial Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, falſe Colourings, wreſted Conſtructions, and tragical Declamations, have frequently impoſed on the Credulity of the well-meaning deluded Multitude. Thus the moſt honourable Cauſe that wiſe and good Men can engage in, the Cauſe of Liberty, has been often diſgraced; Nations once as free and as happy as ourſelves, have been frighten'd into Anarchy, plung'd into all the Horrors of a civil War, and ended their miſerable Career in the moſt humiliating and abject Slavery, until the ſacred Name of Liberty has become a Word of Scorn and Mockery in the Mouths of Tyrants, and their abandoned Minions and Emiſſaries.</p>
            <p>SUCH are the Calamities which have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ariſen from an ardent miſtaken Zeal,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013167_0007_0F8EC6FC050460C8"/>
and from the falſe Refinements of ſpeculative Men, who amuſe themſleves and the World, with viſionary Ideas of Perfection, which never were, nor ever will be found, either in publick or in private Life. You, Gentlemen, cannot even be ſuſpected of being under the Influence of ſuch Deluſions; there are many among you who are eminently learned, not only in the Laws of the Land, but in the Laws of Nature and Nations, in the general Laws of Reaſon and Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, who know their Authority and revere them, not as they have been ſometimes explained on the narrow illiberal Principles of party Spirit, but as they have been underſtood, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd by the Wiſe of all Ages, and have ſerved for the Baſis of the moſt perfect Syſtems of Legiſlation. Theſe are the only Rules by which all political Opinions ought to be tried and examin'd, by which an honeſt Man and a good Citizen, can form a true Judgment of the Duty he owes to his King and his Country.</p>
            <p>IT would have been happy for the World on many melancholy Occaſions, that the revealed Will of God, which ought to be the ſole Rule of every Man's Conduct, the only tranſcendent Authority from which there lies no Appeal, had never received but one general Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Regard to the reciprocal Duties of the Sovereign and the People; but even that ſacred and eternal Standard of Right and Wrong, in private Life has been alternately perverted and profan'd in the political World, by the indiſcreet Zeal and wild Paſſions of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013167_0008_0F8EC70097026180"/>
mad Enthuſiaſts, or ſalviſh Bigots, has been equally abuſed, to ſerve the Purpoſes of a Charles or a Cromwell, of a Gregory, or a Venner, to throw a Veil over the Horrors of Anarchy, and Rebellion, or to ſanctify the ridiculous and damnable Doctrines of Non-reſiſtance, and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive-Obedience, on a proper Application of the general Doctrines, and Principles, I have mention'd, to the peculiar and local Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this Country; your Proceedings, and Reſolves, ought to depend, by a competent Knowledge of the Character of the Times, when the Colony Charters were granted; of the Kings, by whom they were granted; of the People, to whom they were granted; of the Purpoſes for which they were aſk'd and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; of the Tenor and Spirit of the Charters themſelves, how they were underſtood, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued by our Anceſtors; by a Knowledge in ſhort of the Hiſtory of our Country, we may diſcover the general Conſtitution of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and be able to judge whether the preſent Diſcontents are founded on Truth or Ignorance.</p>
            <p>BY a due and candid Examination of this very intereſting Subject, it may perhaps appear, that the Character of the Times, when moſt of the Charters were originally granted, bore very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Reſemblance to the preſent Times; that the ineſtimable Privileges of a modern Engliſhman, might indeed be found in ſome Degree, in the Letter of the Law, but had never been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, were generally very imperfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and rarely claimed by our Anceſtors;
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013167_0009_0F8EC701CDD89F68"/>
that even theſe legal conſtitutional Privileges were encumbered with a Thouſand legal Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, which they patiently ſubmitted to, altho' they would exceed the Patience of a modern Frenchman; that they felt and diſcover'd infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more Zeal, for their religious, than for their civil Liberty, and would have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with half the Privileges their Poſterity enjoy, for an Act of Toleration. It will appear, that the Kings, by whom the Charters were granted, were not deſpotick Kings, that they conſtitutionally poſſeſs'd the executive, not the ſupreme legiſlative Power, of which they only made a Part; that in all Queſtions of Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, they were under the Control of the other parts of the legiſlative Power. That our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, were Subjects of the Kings of England, not as the Inhabitants of Guyenne formerly were, or as thoſe of the Electorate of Hanover are now, but Subjects of an Engliſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary King; Engliſhmen in the fulleſt Senſe of the Word, with the ſame Habits and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, ſpeaking the ſame Language, govern'd by the ſame Maxims, Cuſtoms and Laws, with ſcarce any Diſtinction, but the Latitude and Longitude of their new Reſidence.</p>
            <p>THAT if their Charters were granted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Concurrence of Parliaments, it was not becauſe a Parliament had no Right to interfere, but becauſe they did not in thoſe Days appear of Importance enough to be agitated in the great Council of the Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:013167_0010_0F8EC7021776C660"/>
THAT altho' by their Charters, our Anceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were empowered to make By-Laws for their own local Convenience, they were never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs expreſsly and formally reſtrain'd from making Laws repugnant to the Laws of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland; and were univerſally underſtood, both there, and here, to owe in Common with all Engliſhmen, an Obedience to the Laws, from which no King could releaſe them, becauſe no King could diſpenſe with the Laws. That from this parliamentary Authority, they never wiſh'd until of late, to be emancipated, but would rather have fled to it for Protection, from the arbitrary Encroachments of a James, or a Charles, armed with the Uſurpations, and Abuſes, of privy Seals, Benevolences, Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, Star Chambers and High Commiſſion Courts, and from the Enormities of the two ſucceeding Reigns; that ſuch were the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of the Times, when our early Charters bear their Dates, that if they were not granted by parliamentary Kings, they were granted by Tyrants, and we ſhall gain nothing by recur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to firſt Principles.</p>
            <p>THAT no political Society can ſubſiſt, unleſs there be an abſolute ſupreme Power lodg'd ſomewhere in the Society, has been univerſally held as an uncontrolable Maxim in Theory, by all Writers on Government, from Ariſtotle down to Sidney and Lock, and has been as univerſally adopted in Practice, from the Deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Morocco, to the Republic of St. Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no; as long as Government ſubſiſts, Subjects
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013167_0011_0F8EC702A42E96A8"/>
owe an implicit Obedience to the Laws of the ſupreme Power, from which there can be no Appeal but to Heaven. We for ſome Years paſt have been multiplying ineffectual Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Petitions, and Remonſtrances, and advancing Claims of Rights, &amp;c. Our Petitions have at laſt been neglected, or rejected, or cenſured; the Principles on which we found our Claims, have been formally denied. To what, or to whom, ſhall we have Recourſe? Shall we appeal to the King of Maſſachuſetts Bay, to the King of Connecticut, to the King of Rhode Iſland, againſt the King of Great Britain, to reſcind the Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain, to diſpenſe with the Laws, to which as a neceſſary and efficient Part of that Body, he has ſo recently given his Aſſent? Ridiculous as theſe Queſtions may appear, I am afraid they are but too much of a Piece with Doctrines which have been lately broached, inculcated every where, and almoſt every where receiv'd. The Colonies are conſtitutionally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant of each other: They formally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge themſelves loyal, and dutiful Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his Majeſty GEORGE the Third. But ſeverally claim an Exemption from the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Britiſh Parliament. A Doctrine ſo repugnant to the Ideas of all our Fellow-Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in Great Britain, can I truſt, have no Place in your Aſſembly. The Buſineſs you have to tranfact, is too ſerious to be trifled with; the Confidence repoſed in you, too ſacred to be ſacrificed to idle Sophiſtry and viſionary Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions; the Fate of America, may depend
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013167_0012_0F8EC703831A5B78"/>
on your Reſolves; they ſhould be founded on Principles that are plain, and intelligible, that are marked with the Authority of univerſal Opinions and Truths.</p>
            <p>THE ſupreme Power of the Britiſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over her Colonies, was ever till very lately, as univerſally acknowledg'd, by ourſelves, as by our Fellow-Subjects in England. It uſurps no Claim to infallibility in its Opinions, but gives the Subject of legal Right of petitioning, remonſtrating, of propoſing Plans of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and Redreſs. Nevertheleſs, tho' it pretends not to Infallibility, like all other Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, it requires an implicit Obedience to its Laws, and has a Right to enforce it. A Tribe of Savages, unreſtrained by Laws, human or divine, may live in ſome Harmony, and endure for Ages, becauſe in the State of Nature, there are at the moſt but two or three Subjects, to contend about, and the Individuals are recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally over-awed by the natural Rights of private Revenge. But in civil Soceity, compoſed as in commonly is, of ſuch an infinite Number of heterogeneous and diſcordant Principles and Intereſts, in Trade, in Politics, and Religion, where Subjects of Contention preſent themſelves by Thouſands every Hour; no Conſtitution can ſubſiſt a Moment, without a conſtant Reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of private Judgment, to the Judgment of the Publick.</p>
            <p>WHAT Part then, Gentlemen, have you left you to act, but to propoſe, with the Modeſty of Subjects, ſome practicable Plan of Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013167_0013_0F8EC70429890E80"/>
and to obey? Shall the Time of ſo reſpectable an Aſſembly be ſquandered, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing Claims of Right, that have been urged, and rejected a thouſand Times; that have been heard, conſidered, ſolemnly debated, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by the only Power on Earth, who has a Right to decide them? Shall the Opinions and Deſires of a ſmall Part of the Community, prevail againſt the Opinions, and Deſires of the Majority of the Community? What new Species of Eloquence can be invented to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade? What new Logick to convince the Underſtandings of our Fellow-Subjects? Shall the Britiſh Senate be governed by the pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Maxims of a Poliſh Diet, and the Veto of a ſingle Member, or of a few Members, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſtinguiſhed by extraordinary Wiſdom, and Virtue, obſtruct or ſuſpend, or annul the Legiſlation of a great Nation?</p>
            <p>THOSE wiſe and virtuous Citizens themſelves hold ſuch Doctrines in Deriſion. While a Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is in Agitation, they debate with Freedom, but they claim no blind Submiſſion to their Opinions, no Authority, but the Authority of their Arguments. They arrogate not to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, a Monopoly of all the Wiſdom, and all the Virtue in the Nation. When the Queſtion is decided, they ſubmit their private ſpeculative Opinions, to the Opinion of the Majority, to the Law of the Land. They revere the Law, and make it the Rule of their Conduct.</p>
            <p>You therefore, Gentlemen, the Delegates of a very numerous, and reſpectable People, will
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013167_0014_0F8EC7052A1E0738"/>
ſurely think it below the Dignity of your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, to aſſemble with the Paſſions and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of a common Town Meeting, to ſit in Judgment, like ſome foreign Imperial Power on the Decrees of a Britiſh Legiſlature; to arraign the Conduct of Adminiſtration, in the lofty emphatick Tone of a Manifeſto. Can ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings anſwer any Purpoſe, but the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Purpoſes of exaſperating and provoking the Indignation and Vengeance of the Orders and Degrees of Men in the parent Country? Of alienating the Affections of the People here, ſeducing them from their Allegiance, inflaming their Paſſions, and exciting them to popular Tumults, and Inſurrections? The Order and Tranquillity of Government frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends more upon the Manners and Morals of the People, than upon their Laws and Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. For the Honour of our native Country, there are I believe, few Inſtances on Record, of any People under a free Government, who have paſſed thro' the ſame Length of Period, with ſo few civil Commotions, tho' the Powers of Government have never been vigilantly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted, nor the Laws held in any extraordinary Veneration. But the Manners and Morals of our Countrymen, are undebauched and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, compared with thoſe of the Inhabitants of older Countries, where the Inſtruments of Corruption, and the Incitements of Vices and Crimes are more general. The Danger is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs the ſame, or greater. There are no Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on Earth more ſecure from the humilitaing
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013167_0015_0F8EBA5FE2E34E10"/>
Effects of Poverty, more ſuperiour to the Smiles, or Frowns of Power, more unawed by the Diſtictions of Birth and Fortune, more confident, or tenacious of their own Opinions, or more on a level with all the World in their Converſation and Behaviour. The Paſſions of ſuch Men, agitated by falſe Principles, and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken Zeal, are more dangerous to the Repoſe of the World, than the Frenzy of the moſt diſſolute, and abandon'd Slaves. You will ſurely beware how you inflame the Minds of ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deluded Citizens, or the Time may come, perhaps it is not very diſtant, that you will wiſh, when it will be too late, to calm the Storm you have raiſed, and will tremble every Moment, leſt it burſt on your own Heads.</p>
            <p>UPON the Subject of a Non-Importation and Non-Exportation Agreement, I am at a Loſs what to ſay, it has been ſo often and ſo warmly recommended, as a ſpecific Remedy for all our Complaints, has received the Sanction of ſuch General Authority, that I am afraid it will look like an affront to the Underſtandings of my Fellow Citizens, an Apoſtacy from my native Country to inſinuate the leaſt Doubt of its Efficacy. Yet let me moſt earneſtly conjure you, by the common Love we bear to that Country, by the Gratitude we owe to the parent Country, by the important Truſt repoſed in you, as you value your preſent and future Peace, and the Intereſts and Happineſs of your Poſterity, Beware how you adopt that Meaſure, how you engage in that ſtrange conflict of Sullenneſs and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013167_0016_0F8EC705A172E978"/>
Obſtinacy, till you have given it the moſt calm and ſerious Deliberation.</p>
            <p>THE efficacy of the Meaſure, admitting it to be a practicable one, depends, I preſume, upon the Importance of our Commerce with Great-Britain; it is poſſible that People in general here, may have been much deceived, in this Matter, by partial and exaggerated Calculations, made under particular Circumſtances, during particualr. Periods, to ſerve the Prupoſes of Party. It would be difficult, if not impoſſible to aſcertain the exact Value of it. But if we may truſt to the Authority of Men of Eminence, who have treated this Subject, as Politicians at large, unbiaſſed by partial, local, or temporary Views, Men who have traced it through the Books of Cuſtom-Houſes, Merchants, Brokers, Manufacturers, &amp;c. the beſt Sources of Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; if we can depend on the Opinions of the moſt intelligent Merchants of our own Country; if we can believe our own Eyes, every Man of common Obſervation, and Reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt be aſſured, that the amount of Britiſh Manufactures imported into this Country, is very inconſiderable, compared with the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions about it, that are ſo induſtriouſly circulated thro' all the Colonies, and ſo generally received. Let us examine by the ſame Rule, the amount of the Inland, and Coaſting Trade, of Great-Britain, and her Foreign Trade, with all the Nations on Earth; it will appear infinitely greater, than our Countrymen in general (accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed from the Vanity natural to all Mankind
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013167_0017_0F8EC706691FB5C0"/>
to conſider the little Scenes, and Tranſactions immediately under their Eyes, as Objects of the greateſt Magnitude) can form any adequate Idea of. The Reſources of her Trade are infinite, the Combinations of it, too various and complicated, the Revolutions of it, too ſudden and frequent, to be eaſily explained, or underſtood. But we may judge of it, by the Reſult, and Effect of the whole, whenever the aſtoniſhing Power of the Nation is called forth into Exertion. Can we ſeriouſly believe, that this Wealth, and Power, is derived almoſt entirely, from her North-Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Colonies? Can we, (who by our own Confeſſions do not yet enjoy even all the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of Life) can we reſonably hope, to ſtarve into Compliance, ſo great, and ſo powerful a Nation? Shall we puniſh ourſelves, like froward Children, who refuſe to eat, when they are Hungry, that they may vex their indulgent Mothers? Or like deſperate Gameſters, ſtake at one throw, our ſmall, but competent, and happy Fortunes, againſt the ſucceſſive Stakes, the accummulated Wealth of Ages? We may teize the Mother Country, we cannot ruin her. Let us beware how we engage in ſuch an unequal Conteſt, leſt while we are giving her a ſlight Wound, we receive a Mortal one.</p>
            <p>IF notwithſtanding, we are confident, that the Meaſure of a Non-Importation, and Non-Exportation Agreement, bids fair to be a ſucceſsful one; it certainly behoves us as Men, and as Chriſtians to be ſure, that it is a juſt Meaſure. A Combination to Ruin, or to obſtruct
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013167_0018_0F8EC70748A05750"/>
the Trade of a fellow Citizen, who happens to differ from us, in his religious, or political Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, adopted in Paſſion, proſecuted by the Intrigues of a Cabal, by Innuendoes, Inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Threatnings, and publicly ſigned, by large Numbers of leading Men, would I preſume, be a manifeſt Violation, of the Laws, of God and Man, and would on Conviction, be ſeverely puniſhed in every Court of Juſtice in the Univerſe. In what Colours then will appear, the Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of a large, and reſpectable Body of Subjects, againſt the ſupreme Power of the Community? Adopted from the ſame Motives, proſecuted by the ſame Arts, and publickly ſigned, in the Face of the whole World? Happily for us, by the generous, and noble Spirit, of the Britiſh Conſtitution, our own Conſtitution, the Crime of Treaſon, which in almoſt every other Country, is vague, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defined, often in the Breaſt of a venal, and corrupt Judge, and made not to warn, but to enſnare the People, is exactly and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, aſcertained and defined.</p>
            <p>SHALL we abuſe the Generoſity, and Benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of Laws, made for our Protection? Shall we ſkulk, behind the Letter of the Law, while we wage War, againſt the Spirit of it. Becauſe our Anceſtors had foreſeen the Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, of the Subjects levying Arms, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the State in Paſſion, and Deſpair, but knew no Inſtance on Record, of their having meditated, in cold Blood, its Deſtruction, and had therefore made no regular Proviſion againſt
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013167_0019_0F8EC707EF668580"/>
an Enormity, which they preſumed, could never happen.</p>
            <p>IT is, I believe, ſufficiently notorious, that there are great Numbers, of our Countrymen, from one End of this Continent, to the other, who are averſe from this Meaſure, ſome of them from Opinion, others from Intereſt, and many from down-right Neceſſity.</p>
            <p>FOR the Sake of common Humanity, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, diſdain to co-operate, with Hand Bills, with News Papers, with the high menacing Reſolves of common Town Meetings; do not conſpire with them, to reduce, under the Pains, and Penalties of Diſgrace, and Infamy, Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of your Fellow Citizens, to the cruel Alternative, of involving themſelves, their Wives, and Children, in Indigence, and Wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs; or of being publicly branded, and pointed out by the frantic Multitude, as Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, and Traitors to their Country.</p>
            <p>LET us, in the Name of common Senſe and Decency, be conſiſtent. Shall we Proteus like, perpetually change our Ground, aſſume every Moment, ſome new and ſtrange Shape, to defend, to evade? Shall we eſtabliſh Diſtinctions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween internal, and external Taxation one Year, and laugh at them the next? Shall we confound Duties, with Taxes, and Regulations of Trade with Revenue Laws? Shall we rave againſt the Preamble of the Law, while we are ready to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the enacting Part of it? Shall we refuſe to obey the Tea Act, not as an oppreſſive Act, but as a dangerous, a ſole Precedent of Taxation, when every Poſt-Day ſhews us a Precedent, which
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013167_0020_0F8EC708B3F03038"/>
our Fore-Fathers ſubmitted to, and which we ſtill ſubmit to, without murmuring? Shall we move Heaven, and Earth, againſt a triflng Duty, on a Luxury, unknown to nine Tenths of the Globe, unknown to our Anceſtors! Diſpiſed by half the Nations of Europe! Which no Authority, no Neceſſity compels us to uſe? There are Thouſands of honeſt induſtrious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, who have no Reſources, but in the Conſequences of Exportation, and Importation. Shall we levy a Tax. upon theſe innocent Citizens, a Tax unheard of, diſproportionate, a Tax, never ſuggeſted by the moſt inhuman Tyrant? A Tax, to the Amount of their daily Bread? Reflect one Moment, on the Terms, in which the Reſolves of every Town Meeting, on this Continent, ſpeak of the Boſton Port Bill? Altho' it is little more, than a temporary Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion, of the Trade, of that City, until Reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which God, and Man calls aloud for, be made. And altho' the Ports, at a very ſmall Diſtance from Boſton, and every other Port on the Continent, is as free as ever, ſhall we multiply theſe Calamities, ten Thouſand Fold? For ſuch Calamities, muſt be the inevitable Conſequences, of a Non-Importation, and Non-Exportation Agreement. You ought therefore to be confident, that it will prove effectual be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you adopt it. Can any Man ſeriouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have this, who is tolerably acquainted with the Hiſtory, and preſent State, of theſe Colonies? Who has viſited our principal Cities and Towns, and has obſerv'd by what Means they have riſen to their Wealth, and Importance; how
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013167_0021_0F8EC709B45F5558"/>
they daily increaſe, and how their Inhabitants ſubſiſt? The horrid Puniſhments, inflicted by deſpotic Princes, are commonly of little avail, againſt a contraband Trade, where any trifling extraordinary Profit, is an irreſiſtable Temptation. What can we expect from a looſe Agreement, where the ſole Subſiſtence of Thouſands is at Stake? In all trading Nations, where there are Duties, or Prohibitions, there are Smugglers, there ever were, and ever will be, until we find ſome Nation, where every Individual, is a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot, or a Saint.</p>
            <p>SUCH an Agreement will have the Defect and Impotence, of Laws, framed on monkiſh Ideas of Purity, againſt the indelible Feelings and Paſſions of Humanity. Can you hope, by Promiſes, by extorted Promiſes, to reſtrain Men from carrying on a clandeſtine Trade with Great Britain? Who Trade every Day, with our inverate Enemies, in Defiance of all Law, and who grow Rich by the Spoils of the fair Trader? Will it not rather happen, as it has happen'd already, that Province will ſmuggle againſt Province, Citizen, againſt Citizen, till we are weary, and aſhamed of being the Dupes, of each other, and become the Laughing Stock of the whole World?</p>
            <p>LET us no longer deceive ourſelves, with the vain Hopes, of a ſpeedy Repeal of the Tea Act, becauſe we triumphed in the Repeal of the Stamp Act; the Acts themſevles, are totally different in their Principles, and their Operation, the Occaſion, by no means Similar.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013167_0022_0F8EC70A36C22488"/>
We have advanced from one extravagant Claim to another, made ſuch ſudden Turnings, and Windings, taken ſuch wild, and rapid Flights, that the boldeſt of our Followers, can follow us no longer; our moſt zealous Advocates, are aſhamed to plead a Cauſe, which all Men, but ourſelves, condemn. Can we any longer doubt that our Friends, on the other Side of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic, as well as our Enemies, altho' they may differ in the Mode, of exerciſing the Authority of Parliament over us, are almoſt univerſally agreed in the Principle? Are we not convinced from a thouſand Teſtimonies, that the Clamour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, is univerſal, and loud? Is this, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, a Seaſon to frighten the Parent Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, into a Repeal? No Man of Spirit in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Life, even on the ſlighteſt Quarrel, will ſubmit to be bullied, and expos'd to the Scorn and Deriſion, of the little Circle he lives in. Can we ſeriouſly hope, that a great Nation, a proud Nation, will be inſulted, and degraded, with Impunity, by her Colonies, in the Face of every rival Kingdom in Europe? Let us then, Gentlemen, relinquiſh for ever, a Project fraught with Abſurdity, and Ruin. Let your Conſtituents hope, that the Occaſion of ſuch an important Aſſembly, will not be wantonly ſquander'd, in opprobrious Reproaches, in bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Defiance to the Mother Country, but in digeſting and propoſing ſome new Plan of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, worthy her Notice and Accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. Diſputes are generally vain, and endleſs, where there are no Arbitrators to award, no
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013167_0023_0F8EC70EB23C4678"/>
Judges to decree, where Arguments, ſuſpected to be drawn from Intereſt, and Paſſion, are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed t o Intereſt, and Paſſion, they produce no Conviction. We may ring eternal Changes, upon Taxation, and Repreſentation, upon actual, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and Non-repreſentation. We may end as we began, and diſagree eternally; but there is one Propoſition, a ſelf evident Propoſition, to which all the World give their Aſſent, and from which we cannot withold ours; that whatever Taxation, and Repreſentation may be, Taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Government, are inſeparable. On the Subject of Taxation, the Authority of Mr. Lock, is generally quoted by our Advocates, as paramount to all other Authority whatever. His Treatiſe on Government, as far as his Ideas are practicable, with the corrupt Materials of all Governments, is undoubtedly, a moſt beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Theory, the nobleſt Aſſertion of the unali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enable Rights of Mankind. Let us reſpect it as the Opinions of a wiſe, and virtuous Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and Patriot, but let us likewiſe, as good Subjects, revere the Laws of the Land, the collected Wiſdom of Ages, and make them the ſole Rule of our political Conduct. Let not Mr. Lock be quoted partially, by thoſe who have read him, to miſlead Thouſands who never read him. When he is brought as an Authority, that no Subject can be juſtly taxed without his own Conſent; why don't they add his own Explanation of that Conſent? <q>i.e. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Majority, giving it either by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or their Repreſentatives choſen by them.</q>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:013167_0024_0F8EC70FCF7B4548"/>
Do we compoſe the Majority of the Britiſh Community? Are we, or are we not of that Community? If we are of that Community, but are not repreſented, are we not in the ſame Situation with the numerous Body of Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders, with the Inhabitants of many wealthy and populous Towns; in ſhort, with a very great Number of our fellow Subjects, who have no Votes in Elections? Shall we affirm that theſe are all virtually repreſented, but deny that we are ſo; and at the ſame Time, be too proud to ſolicit a Repreſentation? or under the trite and popular Pretences, of Venality and Corruption, laugh at it as impracticable? Shall we plunge at once into Anarchy, and reject all Accommodation with a Government, (by the Confeſſion of the wiſeſt Men in Europe, the freeſt and the nobleſt Government, on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of Hiſtory) becauſe there are Imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in it, as there are in all Things, and in all Men? Are we Confederates, or Allies, or Subjects of Great-Britain? In what Code of Laws, are we to ſearch for Taxation, under the Title, and Condition, of Requiſition, as we underſtand the Word? In what Theory of Government, ancient or modern? Is it to be found any where on Earth, but in modern Harangues, modern Pamphlets? And in theſe, only as temporary Expedients. The Supply of Government, muſt be conſtant, certain, and proportioned to the Protection it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords; the Moment one is precarious the other is ſo too; the Moment it fails, civil Society ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires.

We boaſt much of our bountiful Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the Requiſitions made during the laſt War, and in many Inſtances with Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but let us remember and acknowledge, that there was even then, more than one rich Province, that refuſed to comply, altho' the War, was in the very Bowels, of the Country. Can Great-Britain then, depend upon her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions, in ſome future War, a Thouſand Leagues diſtant from North-America, in which, as we may have no immediate local Intereſt, we may look perhaps, with little Concern.</p>
            <p>FROM the Infancy of our Colonies, to this very Hour, we have grown up and flouriſhed under the Mildneſs, and Wiſdom of her excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Laws; our Trade, our Poſſeſſions, our Perſons have been conſtantly defended againſt the whole World, by the Fame of her Power, or by the Exertion of it. We have been very lately, reſcued by her, from Enemies, who threatned us with Slavery, and Deſtruction, at the Expence of much Blood, and Treaſure, and eſtabliſhed after a long War, (waged on our Accounts, at out moſt earneſt Prayers) in a State of Security, of which there is ſcarce an Example in Hiſtory. She is ever ready, to avenge the Cauſe, of the meaneſt Individual among us, with a Power reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by the whole World. Let us then, no longer diſgrace ourſelves, by illiberal, ungrateful Reproaches, by meanly aſcribing, the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Conduct, to the moſt fordid Motives; we owe our Birth, our Progreſs, our Delivery to her; we ſtill depend on her for Protection; we

are ſurely able to bear ſome Part of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of it; let us be willing to bear it. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy then, Gentlemen, your united Zeal and Abilities, in ſubſtituting ſome adequate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent and effectual Supply (by ſome Mode of actual Repreſentation) in the Place of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, ineffectual Requiſitions, or in deviſing ſome Means of reconciling Taxation, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſible Obligation of every Subject, with your Ideas of the peculiar and ineſtimable Rights of an Engliſhman.</p>
            <p>THESE are Objects, worthy a Congreſs, Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, that will confer laſting Benefits on your Country, and immortal Honour on yourſelves.</p>
            <p>IF on the contrary, like Independent States, you arrogate to yourſelves, the ſole Right of judging and deciding in your own Cauſe; if you perſiſt in denying the ſupreme Power of Parliament, which no Parliament will ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce, like Independnet States, we have no Appeal but to the God of Battles. Shall we dare lift up our Eyes to that God, the Source of Truth and Juſtice, and implore his Aſſiſtance in ſuch a Cauſe? There are Cauſes, where, in Spight of the ridiculous Tenets of pious, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded Enthuſiaſts, or of the wicked and mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Doctrines, of Slaves and Tyrants; the very Principles, the original Principles on which civil Society depends, require, where God and Nature call aloud for Reſiſtance. Such Cauſes exiſted in the horrid Catalogue of Oppreſſions and Crimes, under a Philip the Second, a Katharine of Medicis, and in the Liſt of

Do ſuch Cauſes exiſt now among us? Did they ever exiſt? Are they likely to exiſt?</p>
            <p>OPEN if it be not too late, the Eyes of our infatuated Countrymen; teach them to compare their happy Situation, with the Wretchedneſs of Nine Tenths of the Globe; ſhew them the general-Diffuſion of the Neceſſaries, the Conveniencies and Pleaſures of Life, among all Orders of People here; the certain Rewards of Induſtry, the innumerable Avenues to Wealth, the native, unſubdued Freedom of their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and Converſation; the Spirit of Equality, ſo flattering to all generous Minds, and ſo eſſential, to the Enjoyment of private Society, the entire Security of their Fortunes, Liberty, and Lives, the Equity, and Lenity, of their civil and criminal Juſtice, the Toleration of their religious Opinions, and Worſhip.</p>
