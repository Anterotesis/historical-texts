         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <div n="1" type="part">
                     <p>IT does not appear, that any of the Preachers among the Methodiſts have qualified themſelves and the Places of their Aſſembling, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Act of <hi>Toleration</hi>; which Act warrants ſeparate Aſſemblies for the Worſhip of God, that <hi>before</hi> were <hi>unlawful.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The unbounded Licentiouſneſs in holding Aſſemblies for Divine Worſhip, both as to Perſons and Places, which had prevailed for ſome Years before the Reſtoration, and of which our Hiſtories are full; was a ſufficient Warning to the Legiſlature, to have a watchful Eye over that Spirit, which had cauſed ſo much Confuſion in the Kingdom; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the publick Worſhip of God. And the Methods taken from Time to Time to keep-under that Spirit, and to prevent and ſuppreſs all ſuch irregular Aſſemblies, are a plain Evidence, that the Government, in thoſe Days, ſaw the miſchievous Conſequences of them, and the Neceſſity of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting early and effectual <hi>Reſtraints</hi> upon them. And though, at the Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, the Wiſdom of the Nation, <hi>for ſome Eaſe to</hi> ſcrupulous <hi>Conſciences in the Exerciſe of Religion</hi> (as the Words of the Act are) granted an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from the Penalties of former Laws, both to Preachers and People; yet it is plain, that they <hi>ſaw</hi> the miſchievous Conſequences of granting that Indulgence, without ſuch <hi>Conditions</hi> and <hi>Limitations,</hi> as would be a Security to the Eſtabliſhed Government and Religion, againſt the Advantages it might <hi>otherwiſe</hi> give to the Enemies of both.</p>
                     <p>And therefore the Act of Toleration provides, as to the <hi>People,</hi> that none ſhall have the Benefit of it, but ſuch as will take the Oaths to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſubſcribe the Declaration againſt Popery (30 <hi>Car.</hi> II, c. 1;) and as to the <hi>Preachers,</hi> it obliges them, not only to take the ſaid Oaths and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Declaration, but alſo to ſubſcribe the Thirty-nine Articles of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; <hi>thoſe</hi> excepted, which relate to <hi>Ceremonies, Homilies,</hi> the <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But now, this new Sect of <hi>Methodiſts</hi> have broken-thro' all theſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and Reſtraints; neither regarding the Penalties of the Laws which ſtand in full Force againſt them, nor embracing the Protection which the Act of <hi>Toleration</hi> might give them in Caſe they comply'd with the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it. And if this be not an open <hi>Defiance</hi> of Government, it is hard to ſay what is.</p>
                     <p>They began with Evening-Meetings at private Houſes; but they have been going on, for ſome Time, to open and appoint <hi>publick Places</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Worſhip, with the ſame Freedom, as if they were warranted by the Act of <hi>Toleration.</hi> And, not content with that, they have had the Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to <hi>preach</hi> in the <hi>Fields</hi> and other open Places, and by publick Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements to invite the <hi>Rabble</hi> to be their Hearers; notwithſtanding an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Declaration in a Statute (22 <hi>Car.</hi> II. c. 1.) againſt aſſembling in a FIELD, by Name. And how big with Miſchief that Practice in particular is, may be abundantly ſeen in the paſt and preſent Accounts of it in a neighbouring Nation; and may be ſenſibly felt in our own, when it will be too late to remedy it, if not attended to <hi>in Time.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">III. It muſt be confeſſed, that in moſt <hi>other</hi> Steps which the Methodiſts take, the Act of <hi>Toleration</hi> would be a Security againſt the Penalties of former Laws, if they would but qualify themſelves according to the Direction of it; but in the Caſe of <hi>Field-preaching,</hi> it is conceived that it would not ſecure them. For that Act not only requires the Qualifications of <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Subſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> as above, but alſo provides, <hi>That no Congregation or Aſſembly for Religious Worſhip ſhall be there<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>And it would be a ſtrange Conſtruction to give any other Meaning to the Word PLACE in that Clauſe of the Act, than a particular <hi>Houſe</hi> opened for Religious Worſhip, and a fix'd Place to be repaired-to by a Congregation of Diſſenters; in which Senſe it has been univerſally underſtood.

                     <p>This is a Practice which may juſtly be complained of by the Miniſters of the Churches to which they reſort in that irregular Manner; as it puts ſuch Miniſters under the Difficulty, either of rejecting <hi>great Numbers</hi> as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to them, or adminiſtring the Sacrament to <hi>great Numbers,</hi> of whom they have no Knowledge.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI.

                  <p>THE Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> exhorts us, <hi>to be ready to give an Anſwer to every one that aſketh us a Reaſon of the Hope that is in us, with Meekneſs and Fear.</hi> And if this is to be our Conduct towards <hi>every one,</hi> much more are we bound to behave thus to thoſe who are <hi>Overſeers of the Church of God,</hi> and conſequently are inveſted with an Authority to require an Anſwer at our Hands.</p>
                  <p>A Deſire of complying with this Apoſtolical Injunction, induced me, my Lords, about five Weeks ago to publiſh an <note n="*" place="bottom">Whereas ſome anonymous Papers againſt the People call'd <hi>Methodiſts</hi> in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and myſelf and Friends in particular, have been for ſome Weeks printed in a large Edition, and handed about and read in the Religious Societies of the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and given into the Hands of many private Perſons, with ſtrict Injunctions to lend them to no one, nor let them go out of their Hands to any; and whereas, after having accidentally had the haſty Peruſal of them, I find many Queries of great Importance concerning me, and my Conduct, contain'd therein; and as it appears that one Paper has little or no Connexion with another, and a Copy, when applied for, was refus'd me, and I know not how ſoon I may embark for <hi>Georgia</hi>; I am therefore obliged hereby to deſire a ſpeedy open Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the aforeſaid Papers, in order that a candid, impartial Anſwer may be made thereto by me,

And I can aſſure your Lordſhips, that with great Deference to the Dignity of your Office, after earneſt Prayer, with I truſt ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Humility, and unfeigned Simplicity of Heart, I now ſit down to perform my Promiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to give a Candid and Impartial Anſwer to the fore-mentioned Papers, which were ſent me laſt Week, (collected into a Pamphlet) by Mr. <hi>Owen</hi>; I ſuppoſe, according to your Lordſhips Order.</p>
                  <p>I never yet was, and hope never ſhall be ſo far left to lean to my own Underſtanding, as to fancy myſelf <hi>infallible.</hi>—Young as I am, I know too much of the Devices of <hi>Satan,</hi> and the deſperate Wickedneſs and Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of my own Heart, not to be ſenſible, that I am a Man of like Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with others, and conſequently may have ſometimes miſtaken Nature for Grace, Imagination for Revelation, and the Fire of my own Temper, for the pure and ſacred Flame of holy Zeal, which cometh from God's Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. —If therefore, upon peruſing the Pamphlet, I find that I have been blameable in any Reſpect (as in all Probability I may) I will not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs it, but return hearty Thanks both to the Compiler and your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, <hi>tho' unknown.</hi>

                  <p>Indeed it is but of little Conſequence to the Merits of the Cauſe to know who the Author is.—Only thus much may be ſaid, your Lordſhips your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves being Judges, it is not quite fair to <hi>give Stabs in the Dark</hi>; and it is ſome Satisfaction to the Perſon attacked, to know who, and what, his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſts are, that he may know the better how to deal with them— But ſince that cannot be granted, it may be more to the Purpoſe, to conſider the Matters contain'd in the Pamphlet, and to anſwer for myſelf, ſo far as I am concerned.</p>

                  <p>And if the Title-Page is ſo bad, I fear the <hi>Deſign and Scope</hi> of the Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet itſelf is much worſe.—For is it not to repreſent the Proceedings of the Methodiſts as dangerous to the Church and State, in order to procure an Act of Parliament againſt them, or oblige them to ſecure themſelves by turning Diſſenters?</p>
                  <p>But is not ſuch a Motion, at ſuch a Seaſon as this, both uncharitable and unſeaſonable.—Is not the Adminiſtration engaged enough already in other Affairs, without troubling themſelves with the Methodiſts?

                  <p>My Lords, I know of no Law of the State that we have broken, and therefore we have not incurred the Diſpleaſure of the Civil Power.—If your Lordſhips apprehend that we are liable to Eccleſiaſtical Cenſures, we are ready to make a proper Defence whenever called to it by our Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Superiors.—As for myſelf, your Lordſhips very well know that I am a Batchelor of Arts, have taken the Oaths, ſubſcribed to the Articles, and have been twice regularly ordained.—In this Character I have acted both at Home and Abroad, and know of no Law of our Government which prohibits my preaching in any Field, Barn, Street or Out-houſe whatſoever.</p>
                  <p>It is true one or two of my Friends, who preach as I do, were bred Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters, <hi>had</hi> been <hi>licenſed,</hi> and preached in <hi>licenſed Places</hi> before my Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with them, and one or two of the Houſes where the Methodiſts meet, have, without my Knowledge, been licenſed ſince; and therefore the Author of the Pamphlet is quite miſtaken in his <hi>firſt Paragraph</hi> (as well as the Title-Page and Deſign of his Pamphlet) wherein he declares, that <q>it does not appear that any of the Preachers among the Methodiſts have qualified themſelves and the Places of their aſſembling, according to the Act of Toleration; which Act warrants ſeparate Aſſemblies for the Worſhip of God, that before were  un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</q> — I wiſh the Author had taken a little more Care to inform himſelf before he publiſhed the Pamphlet. — He would not then have been guilty of ſo <hi>many egregious Miſtakes,</hi> or without Cauſe have <hi>condemn'd the Innocent,</hi> as he hath done.—However, in the general, he is right.—for, <hi>as yet,</hi> we ſee no ſufficient Reaſon to leave the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and turn Diſſenters;—neither will we do it till we are <hi>thruſt out.</hi> When a Ship is <hi>leaky,</hi> prudent Sailors, that value the Cargo, will not leave it to ſink, but rather continue in it ſo long as they <hi>can,</hi> to help pump out the water.—I leave the Author, my Lords, to make the Application.</p>

                     </q> — But, my Lords, where is this Rubrick or Canon obſerved or inſiſted on by the <hi>Miniſters</hi> or <hi>Church Wardens</hi> through <hi>England, Ireland, Wales,</hi> or his Majeſty's Town of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi> upon <hi>Tweed,</hi> except now and then when they entertain a Grudge againſt ſome particular Methodiſts?

                  <p>At the ſame time, my Lords, I would not ſay any thing that might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny way encourage <hi>Diſorders;</hi> neither would I perſwade the Methodiſts to leave their own Pariſh Churches when the Sacrament is adminiſtered there. On the contrary, I would have them take the Author's Advice, <hi>Pag.</hi> 6. <hi>Parag.</hi> 6. <q>If particular Perſons are diſpoſed to receive Weekly, when the Sacrament is not adminiſtered at their own Pariſh-Church, to repair privately to the Church neareſt their own, where the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is adminiſter'd every Lord's-day, having firſt ſignified their Names to the Miniſter, as the Rubrick directs.</q> —This, I believe, they will readily comply with.—For I cannot think with this Author (in the ſame Paragraph,) that the Reaſon of their coming in ſuch Numbers is, that they may have the <hi>vain Pleaſure of appearing together in a Body, and as a diſtinct Sect.</hi>—We would rather, according the Rules of that Charity which hopeth all things <hi>for the beſt,</hi> believe that they come together in ſuch Companies to animate and encourage one another.— Dr. <hi>Horneck,</hi> I remember, in his Account of the primitive Chriſtians, remarks, that "where you ſaw one Chriſtian, you might generally ſee more." And is it not delightful, my Lords, to behold a Communion Table crowded? Do not ſuch as complain of it diſcover ſomething of the Spirit of thoſe <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who were <hi>angry</hi> when ſo many People brought their Sick to be healed by our Lord Jeſus on the Sabbath-day? For I cannot think the Miniſters complain of this only on account of their being hereby <q>

that Hundreds receive the bleſſed Sacrament, both in <hi>London</hi> and other Places, where there are no Methodiſts, whom the Miniſter knows little or nothing at all about, takes no pains to enquire after.

                  <p>This, as well as the other Objections againſt the Methodiſts, are ſo <hi>tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial,</hi> and the Acts referred to as diſcountenancing their Field-preaching ſo <hi>impertinent,</hi> that the Author, without the leaſt Degree of a <hi>prophetick Spirit,</hi> might <hi>eaſily foreſee,</hi> Parag. 8.

                  <p>For my own part, my Lords, I know of no Reaſon why they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced, except this, <hi>viz.</hi>

                     </q> —I aſſure your Lordſhips, I have not been altogether a <hi>Stranger</hi> to theſe Societies.—I uſed to meet with ſome of them frequently, and have more than once preached their Quarterly Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon at <hi>Bow-Church.</hi>— Some who before had only the <hi>Form of Godlineſs,</hi> our Saviour was ſince pleaſed to call <hi>effectually</hi> by his Grace.—But when they began to talk <hi>feelingly</hi> and <hi>experimentally</hi> of the New-Birth, free Juſtification and the Indwelling of the Spirit of God in Believers Hearts, they were ſoon looked upon as <hi>Righteous over-much,</hi> and accordingly were caſt out by their <hi>ſelf-righteous</hi> Brethren.— Theſe were <hi>the late Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies,</hi> my Lords, into which the Author (juſt at the Concluſion of his firſt Part) ſays, that ſome have been <hi>unhappily miſled</hi>; and this, my Lords, was the <hi>firſt Riſe</hi> of the Societies which the Methodiſts now frequent. —Oh, that He and all that oppoſe them had been miſled into the like Extravagancies! I mean a real Experience of the New-Birth, and the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> imputed and applied to their Souls by Faith through the Operation of the Eternal Spirit! For without this they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.—Theſe things, my Lords, the <hi>firſt Members</hi> of the Religious Societies in <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> were no <hi>Strangers</hi> to.—Nay, their being <hi>miſled</hi> into what the Author calls the Methodiſts <hi>late Extravagancies,</hi> was the Riſe of <hi>their</hi> Societies, as well as <hi>ours</hi>; and they met for the <hi>very ſame Ends,</hi> and I believe in the <hi>very ſame Spirit</hi> as the Methodiſts now do.—For a Proof of this, I would refer the Author to Dr. <hi>Woodward</hi>'s Account of the Riſe and Progreſs of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Societies in the City of <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c.— My Lords, I have been reading over his ſecond Chapter, and in reading it could ſcarce refrain weeping, when I conſider'd how <hi>blind</hi> the Author of this Pamphlet muſt be, not to diſcern that the firſt religious Societies anſwered as to their <hi>Spirit, Experience,</hi> and <hi>Ends of meeting</hi> to the Methodiſts Societies, as Face anſwers to Face in the Water.—Let him not therefore mention the <hi>Predeceſſors</hi> of the preſent <hi>London</hi> Societies (the laſt Words of the firſt Part) as though that would <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> his Cauſe.—Indeed, my Lords, it <hi>weakens</hi> it much.—For was it poſſible for theſe Predeceſſors to riſe from

                  <p>And why, my Lords, ſhould the Author be ſo averſe to <hi>Field-preaching</hi>? Has not our Saviour given a <hi>Sanction</hi> to this Way of preaching?

And can we copy after better Examples? If it be ſaid "that the World was then <hi>Heathen,</hi>" I anſwer, and am perſwaded your Lordſhips will agree with me in this, that there are Thouſands and Ten Thouſands in his Majeſty's Dominions, as ignorant of true and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled Religion, as ever the <hi>Heathens</hi> were? And are not Perſons who dare venture out, and ſhew ſuch poor Souls the way to Heaven, <hi>real Friends</hi> both to Church and State? And why then, my Lords, ſhould the <hi>Civil Power</hi> be applied to in order to quell and ſuppreſs them? Or a Pamphlet encouraged <hi>by ſeveral of the Right Reverend the Biſhops,</hi> which is manifeſtly calculated for that Purpoſe? I would humbly ask your Lordſhips, whether it would not be more becoming your Lordſhips Characters, to put your Clergy on preaching againſt <hi>Revelling, Cock-fighting,</hi> and ſuch like, than to move the Government againſt thoſe, who out of Love to God and precious Souls put <hi>their Lives in their Hand</hi> and preach unto ſuch Revellers, Repentance towards God, and Faith towards our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi>? What if the Methodiſts, <hi>by Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Advertiſements do invite the Rabble</hi>? (as our Author is pleaſed to write <hi>Pag.</hi> 4. <hi>Paragraph</hi> 2.) Is not the ſame done by other <hi>Clergy,</hi> and even by <hi>your Lordſhips,</hi> when you preach Charity Sermons? But, my Lords, what does the Author mean by the <hi>Rabble?</hi> I ſuppoſe the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People.</hi>—If ſo, theſe are they who always heard the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus</hi> gladly.—It was chiefly the Poor, my Lords, the ΟΧΛΟΣ, the <hi>Turba,</hi> the Mob, the Multitude, theſe People <hi>who</hi> the Scribes and Phariſees, ſaid <hi>knew not the Law,</hi> and were <hi>accurſed;</hi> theſe were they that were evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelized, had the Goſpel preached unto them, and received the Spirit of God's dear Son.—Not many Mighty, not many Noble are called, ſays the Apoſtle. <hi>Indocti rapiunt coelum, dum nos cum doctrina deſcendimus in Gehennam,</hi> ſays one of the Fathers.— And therefore, my Lords, ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we do advertiſe the <hi>Rabble,</hi> and none but ſuch make up our Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories (which is quite falſe) if this be the Methodiſt's <hi>Shame,</hi> they may <hi>glory</hi> in it.—For theſe <hi>Rabble,</hi> my Lords, have precious and immortal Souls, for which the dear Redeemer ſhed his precious Blood, as well as the Great and Rich.—Theſe, my Lords, are the <hi>Publicans and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots</hi> that enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, whilſt <hi>Self-righteous formal

Profeſſors</hi> reject it. To ſhew ſuch poor Sinners the way to God, to preach to them the Power of Chriſt's Reſurrection, and to pluck them as Firebrands out of the Burning, the Methodiſts Preachers go out into the Highways and Hedges,—If this is to be <hi>vile,</hi> by the Help of my God, I ſhall be <hi>more vile</hi>; neither count I my Life dear unto myſelf, ſo that I may finiſh my Courſe with Joy, and be made inſtrumental in turning any of this <hi>Rabble</hi> to Righteouſneſs.— And more eſpecially do I think it my Duty to invite and preach to this <hi>Rabble</hi> in all Places, where Providence ſhall ſend me, <hi>at this Seaſon,</hi> that I may warn them againſt the dreadful Effects of <hi>Popiſh Principles,</hi> and exhort them to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert their utmoſt Endeavours to keep out a <hi>Popiſh</hi> Pretender from ever ſitting upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Throne.—In acting thus, I humbly apprehend, I can do moſt ſervice to the Cauſe of the Bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> his preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty King <hi>George,</hi> my Fellow-Subjects, and the Government under which I live.—And, however, ſuch kind of Preachers may be every where ſpoken againſt now, yet I doubt not but at the great deciſive Day they will be received with a <hi>Euge Bone,</hi> and ſhine as Stars in the Firmament for ever and ever; whilſt thoſe who have only <hi>divined for Hire, have fed themſelves and not the Flock,</hi> and <hi>lorded it over God's Heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi> perhaps, may pay dear for their Preferment, and riſe to everlaſting Contempt—Pardon me, my Lords, for expreſſing myſelf here with ſome Degree of <hi>Warmth.</hi>—I muſt own it gives me Concern, to ſee ſome of the Clergy ſtrain at a <hi>Gnat</hi> and ſwallow a <hi>Camel,</hi> and attempt to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <p>I Troubled your Lordſhips with a Letter ſome Time ago—I now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed according to my Promiſe at the cloſe of that, to anſwer the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the Anonymous Pamphlet entitled, <hi>Obſervations upon the Conduct and Behaviour of a certain Sect uſually diſtinguiſhed by the Name of Methodiſts.</hi>— The Author opens the ſecond Part with this Preface— <q>Beſides the many <hi>Irregularities</hi> which are juſtly charged upon theſe <hi>Iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerant</hi> Preachers as Violations of the Laws of Church and State; it may be proper to enquire, whether the <hi>Doctrines</hi> they teach, or thoſe Lengths they run, <hi>beyond</hi> what is practiced among our <hi>religious Societies,</hi> or in any other Chriſtian Church; be a Service or a Diſſervice to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion? To which purpoſe, the following Queries are ſubmitted to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration</q> — It is here taken for granted that the Methodiſts (termed by our Author either out of Contempt, or by way of Periphraſis) <hi>theſe Itinerant Preachers</hi> are juſtly charged with many <hi>Irregularities,</hi> which amount to Violations of the Laws of Church and <hi>State.</hi> But how has the Author proved, what He here takes for granted? I humbly apprehend not at all — For has it not appeared in my Anſwer to the firſt Part of his Obſervations, that neither the Act of Toleration nor that of <hi>Charles</hi> IId any way affects the Methodiſts, as being Loyal Subjects to His Majeſty King <hi>George,</hi> and Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi>? How then have they been juſtly charged with Violations of the Laws of the State? And has it not been equally made to appear that the Irregularity the Author ſays the Methodiſts have been guilty of, in coming to other pariſh Churches to receive the Sacrament, is owing to the Negligence of your Lordſhip's Clergy
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005515_0034_10184BB0A74EA710"/>
and Church-wardens? How then have they been juſtly charged with Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Laws of the Church? But may we not ſuppoſe by his ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeemingly ſo contemptuouſly of <hi>theſe Itinerant Preachers,</hi> that Iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerant preaching itſelf, is one of theſe many Irregularities and Violatio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s of the Laws of the <hi>Church at leaſt,</hi> if not of the <hi>State,</hi> which according to this Author are juſtly charged upon theſe <hi>Itinerant Preachers?</hi> His eighth Query, page 11th (which for Method Sake I would here beg leave to make ſome Remarks upon) beſpeaks as much—For He therein ſubmits it to the Conſideration of the publick <q>Whether; in a Chriſtian Nation, where the Inſtruction and Edification of the People is provided for, by placing Miniſters <hi>in certain Diſtricts,</hi> to whom the Care of the Souls within thoſe Diſtricts is regularly committed; It can be for the Service of Religion, that Itinerant Preachers run up and down from Place to Place and from County to County, drawing after them confuſed Multitudes of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? An Evil which our Church has wiſely provided againſt, ſays our Author, in the Ordination of a Prieſt, by expreſly limiting the Exerciſe of the Powers conferred upon him, of preaching the Word of God, and adminiſtring the Holy Sacraments, <hi>to the Congregation where He ſhall be lawfully appointed thereunto</hi>
                     </q> — Here indeed is a heinous Irregularity charged upon theſe Itinerant Preachers, even a Violation of the Commiſſion given them when they were ordained Prieſts; — But with what Juſtice, I would refer to your Lordſhips Conſideration — For if, the Commiſſion given us when Ordained Prieſts, abſolutely prohibits us to preach any where beſides in the Congregation where we ſhall be lawfully appointed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, will it not prove too much? And has not the Author in endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to reproach us, unwarily reproached your Lordſhips alſo?—For are not your Lordſhips then equally irregular, equally Violators of the Laws of the Church whenever You preach (tho' it be never ſo ſeldom) out of your Lordſhips reſpective Dioceſſes? And does not this commiſſion thus ſtrictly taken, abſolutely forbid any Preſbyters whatſoever preaching any where be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides in their own particular Congregations? And if ſo, are not all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that exchange Pulpits equally irregular, at leaſt as rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Our Author in the following Paragraph under the forementioned Query tells us, <q>that the Biſhops indeed and alſo our two Univerſities have power to grant Licences to <hi>preach,</hi> of a larger extent, to ſuch Clergymen as as they judge proper; who, in virtue thereof may, if they chuſe, travel from place to place as <hi>Itinerants</hi> — But then the Church has provided in that Caſe (<hi>Can.</hi> 50) That neither the Miniſter, Church Wardens, nor any other Officers of the Church ſhall ſuffer any Man to preach within the Churches and Chapels, but ſuch as by ſhowing their <hi>Licence</hi> to preach, ſhall appear unto them to be ſufficiently Authorized there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005515_0035_10184BB4D2B81570"/>
unto</q> — What theſe Licences for Itinerant preaching are to which the Author here refers is not certain — Does He not ſeem to mean the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Licences which Your Lordſhips give the Clergy, when they take upon them Holy Orders? Are not theſe the Licences which the Church-wardens examine? And what is the end of theſe Licences? Was it ever heard be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that they were to qualify perſons to be <hi>Itinerant Preachers</hi>? Is not the plain end of them to ſatisfy the Church-wardens that the perſons that offer their Service have had a regular Ordination and are ſufficiently Authoriſed to preach? And does not the Author know that theſe Licences now are little regarded? Do not our Letters of Orders anſwer the ſame end to all intents and purpoſes? Were they not judged ſufficient at our firſt ſetting out into the Miniſtry? And after all, what is it that the Miniſters and Church-wardens can do to perſons that have not theſe Licences? Why they are not to ſuffer them to preach <hi>within</hi> their Churches and Chapels? But have they any power, my Lords, to hinder them from preaching <hi>without</hi> their Churches or Chapels? No, bleſſed be God their power is limited <hi>within,</hi> Hitherto can they go, and no further — And therefore ſuppoſing theſe Itinerant Preachers tho' they have no Licences, do not preach <hi>within</hi> any Churches or Chapels without the Miniſters or Church-wardens conſent, how are they juſtly charged with Violating a Law of the Church, tho' they ſhould preach <hi>without</hi> doors to as great Multitudes as ſhall be inclined to hear them?</p>
                  <p>He proceeds in the 3d paragraph under this 8th Query to write thus <q>the practice of licenſing Itinerant Preachers was occaſioned by the low ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents of many Incumbents in the more early days of the Reformation? whoſe Abilities carry'd them no farther than to the reading of <hi>Homilies,</hi> a defect which has long been remedied by a <hi>Liberal Education</hi> of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Numbers of Perſons for the Miniſtry, who regularly perform the Office of <hi>Preaching,</hi> as well as other Duties, in the Pariſhes committed to their Care. And if the forementioned Defect did ſtill continue, as God be thanked, it does not; it would be ill ſupplied by our <hi>Modern</hi> Itinerants, who make it their <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>But my Lords, what can this Author mean by writing thus? For ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the Practice of Itinerant preaching was primarily occaſioned by the low Talents of many Incumbents in the more <hi>early</hi> Days of the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, does it therefore follow, that there can be no other juſt Cauſe aſſigned for Itinerant preaching now? What if the Generality of the preſent many Incumbents depart from the good old Doctrines that were preached in the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005515_0036_10184BB7B3A98A48"/>
more early Days of the Reformation, and notwithſtanding their <hi>liberal</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation, make no other Uſe of their Learning but to explain away the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles and Homilies to which they have ſubſcribed in the grammatical and literal Senſe? Is it not neceſſary in order to keep up the Doctrines, and thereby the real Dignity of the Church, that either the Clergy thus dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, ſhould be obliged to read the Homilies as formerly, and to preach conſiſtently therewith, or that thoſe who do hold the Doctrines of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, ſhould go about from Place to Place, and from County to County, nay from Pole to Pole, if their Sphere of Action extended ſo far, to direct poor Souls that are every-where ready to periſh for lack of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, into the right Way which leadeth unto Life? That this is the Caſe between the eſtabliſhed Clergy and theſe Itinerant Preachers will appear preſently; and how then can this Author charge them with making it their <hi>principal</hi> Employ, wherever they go, to inſtill into the People a few <hi>favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite Tenets of their own?</hi> Has the Author follo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Is it not to be wiſhed that he had at leaſt taken Care to have been better inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? For then he would have ſaved himſelf from the Guilt of a notorious Slander. For is it not evident to all that hear them, that the favourite Tenets the Itinerant Preachers make it their <hi>principal</hi> Employ to inſtill into People's Minds wherever they go, are the Great Doctrines of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, Homilies and Articles of the Church? Such as Man's bringing into the World with him <hi>a Corruption which renders him liable to God's Wrath and eternal Damnation— That the Condition of Man after the Fall of</hi> Adam, <hi>is ſuch that he cannot turn and prepare himſelf, by his own natural Strength and good Works to Faith and calling upon God — That we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted righteous before God, only for the Merit of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt by Faith, and not for our own Works or Deſervings — That they are to be accurſed, that preſume to ſay, that every Man ſhall be ſaved by the Law or Sect which he profeſſeth, ſo that he be diligent to frame his Life according to that Law, and the Light of Nature</hi>— Theſe, my Lords, are ſome of the favourite Tenets of theſe Itinerant Preachers— Their others are like unto them — Can theſe, my Lords, be properly called their <hi>Own?</hi> Or ought it not to be the <hi>principal</hi> Employ of every true Miniſter wherever he goes, to inſtill ſuch T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And may I not take the Freedom of acquainting your Lordſhips, that if all the Right Reverend the Biſhops did their Duty, (eſpecially my Lord of <hi>London,</hi> whoſe Dioceſs is of ſuch a vaſt Extent) they would all of them long ſince have commenced Itinerant Preachers too?</p>
                  <p>But to return to an Examination of the other Part of the Author's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face —After he has taken it for granted, that many Irregularities are juſtly charged upon theſe Itinerant Preachers as <q>Violations of the Laws of Church and State, He adds, it may be proper to enquire, whether the Doctrines they teach, and thoſe Lengths they run beyond what is prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed among our Religious Societies, or in any other Chriſtian Church, be a Service or Diſſervice to Religion.</q> The Religious Societies or any <hi>other</hi> Chriſtian Church? What? Does our Author make the Religious Societies a Church? This is going further than the Methodiſts, whom he is pleaſed to ſtile only a <hi>Sect?</hi> But if the Religious Societies, my Lords, be a <hi>Church,</hi> may it not be proper to enquire how their Doctrines or Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices came to be ſet up as a Rule and Standard for others to go by, ſo that Perſons doing Service or Diſſervice to Religion muſt be judged of accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they deviate from or adhere to the Religious Societies either in Doctrine or Practice? Or ſuppoſing the Religious Societies were to be a Standard for others to go by, was it not incumbent on the Author to give the publick a ſhort Summary &amp; Account of their Doctrines and Practices? For otherwiſe how can the World poſſibly judge whether the Methodiſts do deviate from them, or if ſo, whether they do thereby Service or Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice to Religion? Indeed this Author has told us in his firſt Part how the Religious Societies behave on Sundays, but he has no where acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with the Principles they hold, or how they behave on other Days. — And till he does I will venture to affirm, that unleſs theſe Itinerants teach other Doctrines than the preſent Religious Societies generally hold, and run greater Lengths in Chriſtianity than the Generality of them it is to be feared now run, they will be in great Danger of never arriving at <hi>the Mark for the Prize of their High-Calling in Chriſt Jeſus their Lord.</hi>—</p>
                  <p>I have been the more particular, my Lord, in the Examination of the Preface, becauſe the Author by annexing theſe Words, <q>To which Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the following Queries are ſubmitted to Conſideration,</q> ſeems to lay it down as the Ground-work and Foundation of all the ſubſequent Queries.— And if the Foundation be ſo weak and ſandy, how ſlight and ſuperficial muſt the Superſtructure be?</p>
                  <p>I ſuppoſe your Lordſhips will readily grant that it is the bounden Duty of every regular and fair Writer (eſpecially when he is charging others with Irregularities as Violations of the Laws of Church and State) to take Care that he does not violate the Laws of Chriſtian Charity — Or if he puts Queries to the Publick concerning any Perſons, ought he not to take
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005515_0038_10184BBD111BF970"/>
heed that thoſe Queries are founded upon Truth, and that the Charges therein exhibited againſt them are really matter of fact? But our Author has notoriouſly neglected this fundamental Rule, and thereby not only caſt a laſting Blot and Odium upon his own Character, if his Name was known, but alſo done real Hurt to the Cauſe he would defend— The Query al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready examined concerning Itinerant preaching, wherein he has charged the Methodiſts with inſtilling into People a few favourite <hi>Tenets</hi> of their own, ſufficiently Demonſtrates this — But this is not all, ſeveral of the other Queries now coming under Conſideration are by no <hi>means</hi> founded upon Truth, and contain Charges againſt theſe Itinerants, whereby they are as much wronged and unjuſtly vilified as ever <hi>Stephen</hi> was when the Jews ſuborned Men which ſaid, <hi>We have heard him ſpeak blaſphemous Words againſt Moſes and againſt God, this holy Place and the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To prove this we need only examine the two Queries which immediately follow the Preface—</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Here again it is ſuppoſed that theſe <hi>Itinerant Preachers</hi> either imagine <q>themſelves to be in a State of Perfection, or at leaſt teach others to imagine that they are—And that the Conſequences of this is a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the natural and civil Relations among Men by leading them to a Diſeſteem of their Fellow-Chriſtians, and Superiors who are ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be in a lower Diſpenſation than themſelves?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Heavy Charges my Lords, theſe are indeed!—But what Evidence does our Author produce to prove them? Why really none at all—For here is no Quotation at the Bottom of either of theſe Queries from any of their Writings, ſo that we cannot tell whether they are levelled againſt theſe <hi>Itinerate Preachers</hi> in general or any one of them in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular— And therefore the Prebend of St. <hi>Paul's</hi> who has been pleaſed to reply to my firſt Letter in Vindication of this Author, has done wrong in affirming, as far as I can recollect, <q>that under each Query there is ſome Quotation either from my Journals or other Writings, whereon it is founded</q> — But there is no ſuch Thing under theſe Four wherein ſuch heavy Charges are included — And therefore may I not argue, as the Author does upon another Occaſion in his firſt Part, Page 8th, 'till ſome Proof does <hi>appear</hi> the <hi>Preſumption</hi> muſt be that he has none?</p>
                  <p>In the mean while I dare challenge this Author, and the whole World to produce any Paſſage out of my Writings wherein I have taught any other Chriſtianity than what through the Aids of the Bleſſed Spirit is practicable by <hi>all</hi> Perſons <hi>in all</hi> Conditions; or that I ever preached o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe than <q>that the Performance even of the loweſt Offices of Life <hi>as unto God</hi> whoſe Providence has placed People in their ſeveral Stations, is truly a <hi>ſerving of Chriſt</hi> and will not fail of its Reward (though not of Debt yet of Grace) in the next World.</q> Neither did I ever imagine that I had attain'd, or was already perfect, or taught Perſons to imagine that they were ſo: No, I expect to carry a Body of Sin and Death about with me as long as I live, and confeſs from my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Soul, that I am the chief of Sinners, and leſs than the leaſt of all Saints: I am ſo far from thinking an <hi>Imagination</hi> that we are already in a State of Perfection, is only apt to <hi>lead</hi> Men into ſpiritual Pride, that I condemn it as the very Quinteſcence and higheſt Degree of it.— And the more we are conformed to the Divine Image, the more I ſtrict believe we ſhall be in keeping up our natural and civil Relations among Men, in giving all Honour to whom Honour is due, and in Lowlineſs of Mind eſteeming each other better than ourſelves. And if ſo, my Lords, may not the Author for thus charging theſe <hi>Itinerants</hi> in general <hi>without Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction</hi> be juſtly ſtiled a <hi>L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

any greater Heighth than he himſelf does Query 13th, Page 16, where in ſpeaking of the Holy Spirit, he has theſe Words, <q>whoſe peculiar Office it is, to ſeaſon the Heart with Humility, and to root out of it the <hi>Seeds</hi> (what is that but the very <hi>Inbeing</hi>?) of Pride and vain Glory.</q>

                  <p>Is he not very irregular in writing thus at Random; nay, does he not hereby himſelf openly violate the Laws both of Church and State?</p>
                  <p>It's true, our Author would appear an Advocate for both, but does not his third Query, page 9th plainly prove him a real Friend to neither; eſpecially the latter?

Our Author it ſeems is for another Way of Salvation, <hi>viz.

For what ſays the 11th Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle? <q>We are accounted righteous <hi>before God,</hi> only for the Merit of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt <hi>by Faith,</hi> and not for our own Works or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervings — Wherefore that we are juſtified <hi>by Faith only</hi> is a moſt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Doctrine and very full of Comfort, as more largely is expreſſed in the Homily of Juſtification</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And if both the Article &amp; Homily of the Church of <hi>England</hi> expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that we are juſtified <hi>before</hi> (or in the Sight of) <hi>God,</hi> by <hi>faith,</hi> and <hi>faith only,</hi> how can <q>a careful and ſincere Obſervance of moral duties be a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,</hi> my Lords, of our Acceptance with God, and of our being juſtified in his Sight?</q> And if the Doctrine of being juſtified by <hi>Faith only</hi> be a <hi>wholſome Doctrine,</hi> and <hi>very full of comfort,</hi> how can this Author in the latter Part of this Query now before us, enquire, <q>whether preaching this Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, does not naturally lead People to a <hi>Diſregard</hi> of thoſe, viz. moral

Duties, and a low Eſteem of them; or rather to think them no Part of the Chriſtian Religion?</q> Does he conſider that in writing thus, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly ſymbolizes with the Infidel, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.1. who is introduced after the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had been inſiſting at large on this Doctrine of <hi>Juſtification</hi> by <hi>Faith</hi> only as ſpeaking like our Author, "<hi>ſhall we ſin then that grace may abound</hi>—"?

Do we not rather eſtabliſh them, by laying a Foundation whereon, true <hi>moral Duties</hi> can only be built ſo as to be acceptable in the Sight of God? For what ſays our 13th Article? <q>Works done before the Grace of Chriſt, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of his Spirit, are not pleaſant to God, for as much as they ſpring not of Faith, in Jeſus Chriſt, neither do they make Men meet to receive Grace, or (as the School Authors ſay) deſerve Grace of Congruity; yea rather for that they are not done as God hath wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and commanded them to be done, we doubt not but they have the Nature of Sin.</q> 
                  </p>
                  <p>To this Query our Author annexes the following Obſervation — <q>The Words of the pious and judicious Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> are very material to this Purpoſe <hi>For my part,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I do heartily wiſh that by publick Authority it were ſo ordered, that</hi> no Man, ſhould <hi>ever</hi> preach or print this Doctrine, that Faith alone, juſtifies, <hi>unleſs he joins this together with it,</hi> That univerſal Obedience is neceſſary to Salvation</q> — What Piety and Judgement Mr. <hi>Chillingworth</hi> might be remarkable for I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>But our Author it ſeems looks upon what they call Succeſs in a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Light, and therefore in this 9th <hi>Query</hi> further asks, <q>How it can be reconciled to Chriſtian Humility, Prudence, or Charity, to indulge their own Notions to ſuch a Degree, as to perplex, unhinge, terrify and diſtract the Minds of Multitudes of People, who have lived from

their Infancy under a Goſpel Miniſtry, and in the regular Exerciſe of a Goſpel Worſhip; and all this, by perſuading them, that they have never yet heard the true Goſpel, nor been inſtructed in the true Way of Salvation before.</q> To prove this particular Part of the <hi>Query,</hi> He refers to Paſſages which my Lord of <hi>London</hi> was pleaſed to extract out of my third Journal ſome Years ago ſuch as, <hi>I offer'd Jeſus Chriſt freely to them — I think</hi> Wales <hi>is excellently well prepared for the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt — Received News of the wonderful Progreſs of the Goſpel in</hi> Yorkſhire <hi>under the Miniſtry of my dear Brother</hi> Ingham— <hi>Iwas refreſh'd by a great Packet of Letters, giving me an Account of the ſucceſs of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel— Amoſt comfortable Packet of Letters, giving me an Account of the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the Goſpel</hi>— But how does all theſe Paſſages, my Lords, put altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther afford the leaſt Shadow of a Proof of what this Author here lays to theſe <hi>Itinerants</hi> Charge? Or how can offering Chriſt freely and hearing and writing of the Succeſs of the Goſpel, be interpreted as perplexing, unhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and terrifying and diſtracting the Minds of Multitudes of People &amp;c? Is not this, my Lords, like the other Proofs he brings againſt theſe <hi>Iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerants</hi> in ſome other Reſpects?

Does not <hi>Luther</hi> call this <hi>Articulus ſtantis aut cadentis Eccleſiae</hi>? And is there any Thing, my Lords, ſo very irreconcilable to Chriſtian Humility, Prudence or Charity, for a few young Heads, who do hold this Doctrine, ſeeing thoſe who ſeem Pillars and are the aged Heads of the Church are ſo much out of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to venture out and preach this Doctrine to as great Multitudes of People as will give them the Hearing?

For the Foundation of Comfort which theſe <hi>Itinerants</hi> lay and depend on is the compleat and all ſufficient Righteouſneſs of Jeſus, and the New-Birth or change wrought in the Heart is by them looked upon only as an Evidence that the Perſons thus changed, have indeed got a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation on this Rock of Ages, and conſequently a ſure and certain Hope of a Reſurrection to eternal Life — And is not all this, my Lords, eaſily diſtinguiſhed from <hi>Fancy</hi> and <hi>Imagination?</hi> And does not our Author lead People to a wrong Foundation for Comfort, by directing them to look for it from a <hi>gradual Improvement in Grace and Goodneſs?</hi> For what ſays the Apoſtle? 1 Cor. 3.11. <hi>Other Foundation can no Man lay than that is laid, which is Chriſt Jeſus, — who</hi> (as he ſpeaks in the firſt Chapter of the ſame Epiſtle, Ver. 30.) <hi>is made unto us of God, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and Redemption?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Foundation as well as this ſudden and inſtantaneous Change, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wrought in or after Baptiſm, our Author, it is to be feared, is too great a Stranger to — At leaſt he gives too great Evidence that he has made but little Improvement in Grace and Goodneſs, for he aſks in his 11th Query, Page 13th, <q>Whether the Frame of humane Nature fairly conſidered, the Author of the <hi>Whole Duty of Man,</hi> did not do better Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to Religion, in laying down Rules to keep Recreations of all Kinds within the Bounds of <hi>Innocence</hi>; than they who now cenſure him, and abſolutely deny that Recreations of <hi>any</hi> Kind, conſider'd as ſuch are or can be innocent?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What Rules the Author of the <hi>Whole Duty of Man</hi> may have laid down to keep Recreations of all Kinds within the Bounds of Innocence, it may be needleſs here to enquire— Is it not ſufficient, my Lords, to mention that the holy Scriptures (wherein the whole Duty of Man and that too in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect both to <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Practice</hi> is fully and really taught) lay down one golden univerſal Rule for Recreations and every Thing elſe, viz. that <hi>Whether we eat or drink, or whatſoever we do, we muſt do all to the Glory of God?</hi> Whatever Recreations, People take to the Glory of God, theſe <hi>Itinerants,</hi> my Lords, think are quite allowable — But if they are made Uſe of meerly for Self-pleaſing, and not to God's Glory; and to fit us for his Service, they do affirm, that all ſuch Recreations neither are or can be innocent — And if the Author of the <hi>Whole Duty of Man,</hi> or any other Author whatſoever hath ſet any other Bounds or fixed any other Rule, <hi>however fairly he may
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005515_0050_10184BE2D552CD20"/>
have conſider'd the Frame of humane Nature,</hi> is it not evident, that he has not fairly conſider'd the Frame and Nature of true Chriſtianity? For does not that, my Lords, turn our whole Lives into one continued Sacrifice to God? And if we fairly conſider the Frame of humane Nature how weak and frail it is, and how eaſily diverted from purſuing our one great End, are not thoſe the greateſt Friends to Religion who caution People againſt leading themſelves into Temptations, or making Uſe of any Recreation that may put them out of a ſpiritual Frame and unfit them for the Service of God? Is this going any further than the Apoſtle did, who ſo ſtrictly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Chriſtians not to <hi>grieve the Spirit of GOD whereby they are ſealed to the Day of Redemption</hi>?</p>
                  <p>Our Author under this Head has referred to a Paſſage out of one of my Journals, wherein I gave an Account of my being in ſome polite Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at <hi>Maryland</hi> who were diſpoſed to Cards, and alſo a Paſſage out of my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from <hi>New-Brunſwick,</hi> occaſioned, if I miſtake not, by meeting a Man who thought it allowable to play at Cards in the Chriſtmas Holy-Days, from the Liberty given him by the Author of the <hi>Whole Duty of Man</hi>— And will our Author allow playing at Cards to be a lawful Recreation for a Chriſtian? Is this one of the Recreations of <hi>all</hi> Kinds which may be kept within the Bounds of Innocence? Is it not a kind of caſting Lots? Has it not the Appearance of Evil? Is it not therefore forbidden in the Scriptures? Or if he will not hear the Scriptures will he not hear the Church? And what ſays the 75th Canon? <q>No Eccleſiaſtical Perſon ſhall at any Time, other than for their honeſt Neceſſities, reſort to any Taverns or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

And may I not argue from it thus? Either this Canon is founded upon the Word of God, or it is not — If it be not, why is it not abrogated? If it be, why is it not put in Practice? Why do the Clergy encourage frequenting of Taverns, Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes and Gaming by their own Example? Are not ſuch Practices in this Canon ſuppoſed to be quite contrary to the Purity of Life, and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of Example which may be juſtly required from them? And
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005515_0051_10184BE4A1B14A38"/>
if ſuch Things are unſeemly in a Clergyman, are they not in a Degree equally unſeemly in Laymen whoſe Priviledge as well as Duty it is to be <hi>holy in all manner of Converſation and Godlineſs,</hi> and who are univerſally commanded to <hi>ſhine as Lights in the World amidſt a crooked and perverſe Generation?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>My Lords, might it not reaſonably have been hoped that your Lordſhips were too well acquainted with real and inward Religion, to think that a Soul born of God, and made Partaker of a Divine Nature can ſtoop ſo low, and act ſo unlike itſelf as to ſeek for Recreation in Gaming? Does not the glorious and plenteous Redemption, that great, inexpreſſibly great and preſent Salvation, which the Great High Prieſt and Apoſtle of our Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion has purchaſed for us by ſhedding his dear Heart's Blood, and whereby we are <hi>redeemed from this preſent evil Worlds,</hi> ſet us above ſuch triflng Things as theſe, ſuppoſing they were not directly ſinful? Are not Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians Kings and Prieſts unto God? And is it not as much beneath the Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of their Heaven-born Spirits to ſtoop to ſo low an Amuſement as Gaming of any kind, as ever it was beneath the Dignity of the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to ſpend his Time in the Royal Amuſement of catching Flies? — Does not our Author therefore, my Lords, by writing thus ſtrike at the very Vitals of Religion, and prove too plainly that he is a Stranger to that Power of the dear Redeemer's Reſurrection? Need we therefore wonder at his 12th <hi>Query,</hi> Page 12th, which immediately follows the foregoing one? wherein he enquires, <q>Whether the ſtrong Expreſſions which are found in their printed Journals, of <hi>extraordinary Preſences</hi> of God directing and aſſiſting them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Has his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or any one for him been pleaſed to make any Reply to that Anſwer? Not as I have heard of — And therefore was it not incumbent upon this Author, my Lords, to have diſproved or invalidated my Anſwer to his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Letter before he could honourably mention the Paſſages referred to therein to prove me an <hi>Enthuſiaſt?</hi> But paſſing by this with other many Irregularities which are juſtly charged upon this Anonymous Author, if
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:005515_0052_10184BE62A979468"/>
he aſks whether the ſtrong Expreſſions which are found in their (I ſuppoſe he would have ſaid <hi>his</hi>) printed Journals, for I find under this Query no Journals re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to but mine, of <hi>extraordinary Preſences</hi> of God directing &amp; aſſiſting them in a <hi>more immediate Manner,</hi> do not need ſome Teſtimonies of a Divine Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to clear them from the Charge of Enthuſiaſm? I would aſk this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor again, what Teſtimonies he would have? Can he bring any Proof againſt the Matters of Fact recorded in theſe Journals<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Or will he venture to affirm that I did not feel the Divine Preſence in an extraordinary Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that is more at one Time than another? Or that I have not been di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected in a more immediate Manner, at certain Times when waiting upon God? Were not ſuch like Queries put by the Heathens to the primitive Chriſtians? And was not their Anſwer, <hi>Monſtrare nequeo, ſentio tantum?</hi> I would further aſk, what this Author means by a Divine Miſſion? Did not my Lord of <hi>Glouceſter</hi> (for I muſt again repeat it) give me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> Apoſtolical one when he ſaid, "Receive thou the Holy Ghoſt by the Impoſition of our Hands?" And can it be Enthuſiaſm, or is there any Thing extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in ſaying, that I felt more of the Influences of this Holy Ghoſt, and was aſſiſted in a more immediate Manner in my Adminiſtrations at one Time than another? Or is it not more extraordinary (only indeed that it has been a good while too too common) that the Right Reverend the Biſhops ſhould take upon them to confer the Holy Ghoſt, and the Reverend the Clergy, profeſs they are inwardly moved by it, and yet charge every Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion they meet with, wherein his bleſſed Influences are ſpoke of as felt and experienced, with being downwright Enthuſiaſm? But what ſhall we ſay? <hi>The natural Man diſcerneth not the Things of the Spirit, they are Fooliſhneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, neither can he underſtand them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned</hi>— What if ſome of the Expreſſions, my Lords, in the Journals are <hi>ſtrong</hi>? Does that prove them Enthuſiaſtical? Or what if feeling the Preſence of God and being directed in a more immediate Manner be ſomething extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary to our Author, does it therefore follow that it is ſo to others? Or is this Author like minded with the Right Reverend the Biſhop and the Reverend the Clergy of the Dioceſs of <hi>Litchfield</hi> and <hi>Coventry,</hi> who reckon the Indwelling, and inward Witneſſing of, as alſo praying and preaching by the Spirit among the <hi>kariſmata</hi> the miraculous Gifts conferred on the primitive Church, and which have long ſince ceaſed? If ſo, no Wonder that the Expreſſions referred to are ſtrong and extraordinary to him — But my Lords, may I not beg Leave to tell this Author that theſe Itinerant Preachers <hi>have not ſo learnt Chriſt?</hi> No, they believe that Jeſus is the ſame Yeſterday, to Day and for ever — And that he is faithful who hath ſaid to his Apoſtles, and in them to all ſucceeding truly Chriſtian Miniſters, <hi>Lo, I am with you always even to the End of the World</hi>— Conſequently they believe the Comforter will abide with them for

ever, witneſſing with their Spirits that they are Children of God, leading them by a diligent Search of the holy Scriptures into all Truth, guiding them together with the Word, the Voice of Friends and Providence in all Circumſtances by his Counſel, giving them Utterance when called to ſpeak to the People from God, and helping their Infirmities, and aſſiſting them in Prayer when called to ſpeak to God for the People—Inwardly moved by this Spirit, and not any Hopes of human Grandeur or Preferment, theſe Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, my Lords, firſt took on them the Adminiſtration of the Church, and his bleſſed Influences they have from Time to Time happily experienced, as Thouſands whoſe Eyes have been opened to diſcern ſpiritual Things can teſtify. And being without Cauſe denied the Uſe of their Brethrens Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits, and having obtained Help from God, they continue to this Day wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſing both to ſmall and great the grand Doctrines of the Reformation, <hi>Juſtification by Faith alone in the imputed Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Neceſſity of the Indwelling of the Spirit in order to be made meet to be Partakers of the heavenly Inheritance among all them that are ſanctified</hi> — In doing thus they know of no wholſome Rules, wiſely and piouſly eſtabliſhed "by the Powers Spiritual and Temporal", <hi>Query</hi> 9th, Page 12th, which they have violated, or ſhould they be commanded by the whole Bench of Biſhops to ſpeak no more of this Doctrine — they have an Anſwer ready <q>

Pag. 11.) to bear a faithful Teſtimony againſt them. And being called by the Providence of God abroad, after their unworthy Labours had been bleſs'd at Home, they have judged it meet, right and their bounden Duty from Time to Time to publiſh Accounts of what God had done for their own and other People's Souls— Which tho' deſpiſed by ſome, and eſteemed Enthuſiaſtical by others, have been owned to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Edification of Thouſands— But whether this may be properly called <q>open and publick Boaſting, unbecoming the Modeſty and Self-denial of a Miniſter of the Goſpel, eſpecially one who would be tho't to carry on his Miniſtry under the immediate Guidance of the bleſſed Spirit,</q> (as our Author intimates in his laſt Query of this 2d Part;) or whether they were wrote with a ſingle Eye to the Redeemer's Glory, they are willing to leave
