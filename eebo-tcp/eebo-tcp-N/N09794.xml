            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Jewiſh captivity in Babylon, and their return from it, is frequently mentioned in the ſacred writings: the prophets who lived before this memorable event, had a ſingle eye to it in their propheſies, fore-telling it as the juſt and righteous puniſhment of Jeruſalem's idolatry, vile ingratitude, &amp; incorrigible wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But the three laſt of the prophets lived and propheſied, after the return from Babyloniſh captivity. <q>Haggai, and Zachariah, appeared much about the ſame time: and it was ſome time after the return from captivity, when the building of the temple was both retarded by <hi>its enemies,</hi> and neglected by its friends.</q> Then the prophets, Haggai the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:012464_0003_0F89C9D70C688380"/>
prophet, and Zachariah the ſon of Iddo, prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied unto the Jews that were in Jeruſalem, in the <hi>name of the God of Iſrael:</hi> to reprove them for their coldneſs and indifferency, reſpecting the worſhip of God, and for their careleſneſs, and remiſneſs, in letting the houſe of God lie waſte: and to encourage, and animate, and quicken them to revive the good work of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the temple, which had now been neglected for ſome conſiderable time, and to go on with it with vigour and reſolution, notwithſtanding any oppoſition, they had or ſhould meet with in this noble and important undertaking. And among other things that the prophet Haggai mentions, by God's direction, to encourage and animate the people to go on, with the laudable work of building the ſecond temple, this is one mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the text, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <q>that the glory of this latter houſe ſhould be greater than of the former.</q> The houſe here referred to, is the ſecond temple at Jeruſalem, whoſe glory ſhould excel that of the firſt temple. The firſt temple was built by king Solomon, by the expreſs direction of God himſelf, for the honour of his adorable name, for his worſhip and ſervice, near five hundred years before this ſecond: and it was, no doubt, the moſt curious ſtructure, the moſt magnificent, rich and coſtly building, the ſun had ever ſhined upon. Which temple, after it was compleated, was by king Solomon piouſly dedicated to God, for ſacred uſe, in religious worſhip and ſervice, an account of which ſolemn dedication, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:012464_0004_0F89C9D85A299220"/>
in the firſt book of Kings, chapter viii, which temple, for the ſins of the people, the prevalence of their idolatry, their notorious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude and awful rebellion againſt God, was ruined by fire. Jeruſalem was deſtroyed, the walls broken down, and the temple burnt, by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, about four hundred years after it was built, and Zedekiah their wicked king, with his chiefs, and ſubjects in general, were carried captives to Babylon,<note n="*" place="bottom">See the account 2 Kings, xxv chapter.</note> where they were enſlaved and cruelly treated, and, where thoſe that hated them, bare rule over them. Now after they had endured the miſeries of captivity, for the ſpace of ſeventy years for their ſins, God who is merciful and invariably true to his word, remembered his covenant, and raiſed Cyrus to the throne, according to his word; who, as ſoon as he was maſter of the kingdom of Babylon, releaſes all God's viſible people from captivity, iſſues a royal and gracious proclamation, granting them full liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to their own land, with orders and aſſiſtance to build the houſe of God in Jeruſalem. See Ezra firſt chapter. At this proclamation mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of the captivated Jews return to their own land, who ſoon engaged in the laudable work of building the houſe of God. But alas! their hearts ſoon grew faint, through the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition they met with, which was ſtrong, and the work ceaſed for ſome time, through the crafty oppoſition of their enemies, and through the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012464_0005_0F89C9D905A8CE88"/>
coldneſs of ſome, and through the cowardice and covetouſneſs of others among the Jews. Hag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gai was the firſt prophet, that appeared in the name of the Lord of hoſts, to arouſe this people to a ſenſe of their duty, to reprove them for their remiſneſs and ingratitude, in letting the houſe of God lie waſte, and to exhort and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage Zerubbabel the governor, and Joſhua the high-prieſt, and the reſt of the people, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the worſhip, and rebuild the temple of God, which had been long neglected. Now God in zeal for his own glory, and in mercy to his people, ſent his ſervant Haggai to awaken and quicken them to their duty, i. e. to build the temple and reſtore the pure worſhip of God. The neglect of which was their ſin and their ſhame, and the procuring cauſe of theſe calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they laboured under: they ſowed much but gathered but little, they eat, but had not enough, they drank, but were not filled, they cloathed themſelves, but were not warm. The reaſon of this is aſſigned, 'tis becauſe the houſe of God lay waſte. But the inſpired pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet does implicitly let them know, that upon their going about this work, God would proſper them and bleſs them with great plenty. The people hearken to this moving meſſage, and ſoon go to work on the Lord's houſe, and they are abundantly ſucceeded in their labour. After the foundation of the ſecond temple was laid, and the houſe began to appear in view, ſome of the younger people who had never ſeen the former
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012464_0006_0F89C9D9D74DD5E8"/>
temple were joyful: but the old men who had ſeen the firſt temple in its glory were ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and even wept. The extraordinary things with which the firſt temple was honoured, and which were wanting in the ſecond, no doubt was ſome cauſe of their grief, as well as that the ſtructure was not ſo magnificent and noble. The things wanting, were ſuch as theſe, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the ark of the covenant, the mercy-ſeat upon it, the ſhecinah, the urim and thummim, and the holy fire upon the altar. And moreover, this latter temple was not ſo large, ſo ſtately and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, as that which Solomon built. And the antient men who were grieved, could remember the firſt temple, and the glory and ſplendor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and were ſenſible of the great diſparity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween this and that. They could remember the gold with which it was adorn'd and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, the ſtones with which it was embelliſhed and decorated, and the magnificence of the porch and of the pillars. But though this houſe would not be ſo magnificent as the former, nor any ways equal it in viſible ſplendor &amp; grandeur, yet God by the mouth of his prophet, encourages the people to go on cheerfully in the building of it—&amp; lets them know that the real glory of the latter houſe, ſhould be greater than that of the former. He gives them to underſtand that they need not be ſolicitouſly concerned, that this houſe had not ſo much ſilver and gold about it as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon's temple had, for ſays the great Lord of the univerſe, <q>the gold is mine and the ſilver is
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012464_0007_0F89C9DA7AB1C1C0"/>
mine,</q> context verſe 8th. He comforts them with this, that although the outward ornaments of this houſe would not equal thoſe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, yet ſtill its real glory ſhould be greater. "The glory of this latter houſe ſhall be greater than the former." This was not ſo in reſpect of outward glory, magnificence and ſplendor. This latter houſe was indeed beautiful, and we find one of the diſciples of our Lord admiring the ſtones, and building of the temple, Mark xiii, 1. But it was nothing in compariſon with the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which king Solomon built, for viſible ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, magnificence and ornaments. It what then did the glory of this latter temple excel that of the former? What made its glory greater?—Why it was the perſonal preſence of Chriſt there, in the days of his humanity. Into this temple, the ſon of God when he became incarnate, was ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brought and preſented to the Lord—here he attended at twelve years old, here he at that age, attentively heard the doctors, and aſked them the moſt intereſting and important queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, inſomuch that all who heard him were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhed at his underſtanding and anſwers. See Luke, ii chapter. Here alſo afterwards, he preached the glorious goſpel, &amp; here he wrought miracles, which were a confirmation of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Father. In the latter temple, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt made his perſonal appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the days of his humanity. In the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Jeſus Chriſt was daily preached, and it was this made its glory greater than that of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012464_0008_0F89C9DCEBEECBB0"/>
God by his prophet, encourages the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to go on in the building of the temple, for ſays the high and holy <hi>One</hi> who inhabits the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Iſrael, I will ſhake the heavens and the earth, and the deſire of all nations ſhall come: &amp; I will fill <hi>this</hi> houſe with glory. This is a plain prediction of the coming of Chriſt, who in the fulneſs of time, perſonally appeared in the houſe, and in reference to this, we are to underſtand the text. In which ſenſe 'tis really true, the glory of the ſecond temple was greater than the glory of the firſt. The former excelled in out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward glory and magnificence, but Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was the glory of the latter. There the Son of God the Saviour of the world, was early preſented, there he was acknowledged as God's anointed, as the light of the Gentiles, as the glory of Iſrael, by good old Simeon, who took him in his arms, and bleſſed God that his eyes had ſeen his ſalvation, and was then ready to depart in peace. Where Chriſt is, there is glory indeed. His preſence renders a houſe of worſhip more glorious, than any outward orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and adornings whatever. From the text thus explained, we may raiſe this general</p>
            <div type="observation">
               <head>OBSERVATION. To enjoy the preſence of Chriſt in his houſe of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, is truly its greateſt glory, and this is what a people ought moſt earneſtly to deſire and ſeek after.</head>
               <p>In illuſtrating this general obſervation, I ſhall purſue the following method, <abbr>viz.</abbr>

               <p>IV. That the preſence of Chriſt in his houſe of worſhip, is truly its greateſt glory.</p>
               <p>I. My buſineſs, according to the method pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, is to ſhew when a people may be ſaid, to have the preſence of Chriſt with them, in his houſe of worſhip.</p>
               <p>We are not now to expect the perſonal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Son of God, in our worſhipping aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, as it was enjoyed in the days of his incarnation, and while he abode here on earth. It is his ſpiritual preſence only, that we are to expect to enjoy: this is what we are to ſeek and pray for, as what is moſt deſirable. And there is no doubt at all, but that Chriſt is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently preſent in his worſhiping aſſemblies here on earth, by the kind influences and teachings of his ſpirit, making the inſtitutions of his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, means of awakening ſinners, of edifying the children of God, and thus owning and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his people. And in general, a people may be ſaid to have the preſence of Chriſt with them, in his houſe of worſhip, when he owns the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ordinances, and makes them means of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual good, to precious and immortal ſouls. But to be particular.</p>

1. When a people have a ſpirit of prayer and ſupplication, in Chriſt's houſe of prayer, then they may be ſaid to enjoy his preſence. A real ſpirit of prayer, is from the great author and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſher of faith, when a people have a right ſenſe of their dependance upon God, for all mercies, ſpiritual and temporal, and come to God in prayer, believing that he is the rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him, when they approach to God, ſenſible of their own nothingneſs, and place their dependance, on the merits and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, for audience with the Father, and make mention of his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and his only, when they ſincerely la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their ſins before God, judging and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning themſelves, as guilty, unworthy crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who have ſinned againſt God, and have forfeited all title to his favour, when they ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely implore the pardon, and forgiveneſs of their ſins, for the great Mediator's ſake, when they offer up their ſincere deſires to God, in the name of Chriſt, they may be ſaid to have the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of prayer, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally preſent with them, preſent with them by his ſpirit, who is then helping their infirmities, with groans which cannot <hi>be uttered,</hi> as the apoſtle expreſſes it. Rom. viii, 26. Likewiſe the ſpirit alſo, helpeth our infirmities, for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the ſpirit itſelf, maketh interceſſion for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered. 'Tis not ſo much the florid expreſſions, 'tis not ſo much
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012464_0011_0F89C9E1AC079B40"/>
the rhetorick and eloquence of our prayers, as the faith, ſincerity and fervency of them, that the ſpirit as interceſſor and helper works in us. 'Tis likewiſe ſaid, Zach. xii, 10. <q>And I will pour upon the houſe of David and upon the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, the ſpirit of grace, and of ſupplication, and they ſhall look upon me, whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his only ſon, and ſhall be in biterneſs for him, as one that is in bitterneſs, for his firſt born.</q> Thus when Chriſt pours out a ſpirit of prayer and of ſupplication upon a people, it may be ſaid, he is ſpiritually preſent with them, he is then with them by his ſpirit, and all the teachings, and all the influences of the divine ſpirit, come to us, as the fruits of the Redeemers purchaſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is ſpiritually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with his people in his houſe of worſhip, when a preached goſpel is there made truly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the ſouls of men; when 'tis made a means of convincing and converting ſinners. The preaching of the goſpel is a mean of grace, which Chriſt has inſtituted, for the ſpiritual good and benefit of precious and immortal ſouls. Miniſters of the goſpel of Jeſus, are his ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors, ſent forth in his name to perſuade, and beſeech them to be reconciled unto God. And the plain perſuaſive preaching of the glorious goſpel, is a mean of grace, which the ſpirit of God often makes uſe of, for the conviction of ſinners, for the awakening of them, and of rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012464_0012_0F89C9E2044BBF28"/>
them, out of their carnal eaſe and ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a means of bringing them to ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and to inquire in earneſt, what they ſhall do to be ſaved: like Peter's hearers, who were pricked in their hearts, and ſolicitouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire what they ſhall do. Acts ii, 37. Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and ſaid unto Peter, and to the reſt of the apoſtles, men and brethren, what ſhall we do? So the preaching of the goſpel, is often made a means of the ſinners converſion. 1 Cor. i, 21. For after that, in the wiſdom of God, the world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wiſdom knew not God, it pleaſed God by the fooliſhneſs of preaching, to ſave them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. But true it is, that preaching will never be to any ſaving purpoſe, unleſs the ſpirit of Chriſt accompanies it to the hearts of men, and makes it a mean of their ſpiritual good. Paul may plant, and Appollos water, but it is God that gives the increaſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>If miniſters had the tongues of angels, they could not of themſelves prevail with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to believe and obey the goſpel; 'tis the office of the ſpirit, to awaken the conſcience, and<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to diſpoſe the ſeveral faculties of the ſoul, to a chearful compliance, with their beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts.</q>
               </p>
               <p>When a preached goſpel is ſet home with power, upon the hearts of ſinners, by the agency of the divine ſpirit, and made a mean of their awakening, and of their ſolicitouſly inquiring what they ſhall do to be ſaved, when tis made a
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012464_0013_0F89C9E450880288"/>
mean of their effectual turning, from the love and practice of ſin, to the love and practice of holineſs, in ſhort, when men and women are new born in the houſe of God, as we are told it ſhould be ſaid of Zion. Pſalm lxxxvii, 5.—And of Zion it ſhall be ſaid, this and that man was born in her: when this is the caſe, it may well be ſaid, the people enjoy the preſence of Chriſt there, for certain it is, without his graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſence, no ſuch mighty effects will ever take place. So when the children of God are edified by means of a preached goſpel, when their graces are increaſed, their love inflamed, their faith ſtrengthened, their zeal enlivened, and their principle of new obedience invigorat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, then they enjoy the preſence of Chriſt. Theſe ſalutary effects, are owing to the ſpirits power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully impreſſing goſpel truths upon their ſouls. And 'tis by means of the ſincere milk of the word, that chriſtians often grow in grace, in purity and holineſs, it is hereby, that the ſaints are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten edified and comforted. In the xcii Pſalm towards the cloſe, is clearly ſet forth, the great advantages ariſing to the godly, from their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout and diligent attendance, upon the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of public and ſocial worſhip, in ſuch lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as this, <q>The righteous ſhall flouriſh like the palm tree: he ſhall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. Thoſe that be planted in the houſe of the Lord, ſhall flouriſh in the courts of our God. They ſhall ſtill bring forth fruit in old age: they ſhall be fat and flouriſhing.</q>

3. The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is ſpiritually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with his people in his houſe of worſhip, when his ſpecial ordinances adminiſtred there, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally beneficial to the ſouls of men. It is the divine bleſſing and teaching accompanying theſe, that renders them ſavingly beneficial to immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſouls. Though baptiſm is to be adminiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed but once, to one and the ſame perſon, yet when one who has been baptized himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds this ordinance adminiſtered to others, it may be beneficial to him. And this it is, when it puts him in mind that he himſelf was once baptized, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt, whereby he was made a nominal chriſtian, initiated into the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible church, and laid under a moſt ſolemn obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to be the Lord's diſciple. It is benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al when it is a mean of awakening people, to a heart-affecting ſenſe of their defilement, and corruption by nature, and of engaging them to apply to the purifying blood of Jeſus, for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and for cleanſing. It is beneficial, when it is a mean of quickening them to cry earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto God, to pour out his ſpirit upon them, to purge them from ſin, and to cleanſe and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify them. It is beneficial, when it is a mean of engaging thoſe, who have had the Name of the Lord called upon them, afreſh to give up ſelves to God the Father, as their God and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to the Son of God as their divine Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and almighty Saviour, and to the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as their divine teacher, leader and ſanctifier.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012464_0015_0F89C9E5CCFCEBB0"/>
And thus you ſee, we are not to be idle ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, when we behold the ordinance of baptiſm adminiſtered to others, we are to make a religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous improvement of it, we are to look to God to make it profitable to our own ſouls. And when it is made a mean of ſpiritual good to precious and immortal ſouls, when many are thus quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, and benefited by it as we have heard, then the people may be ſaid to enjoy the preſence of Chriſt; when this ordinance publickly adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the ſanctuary, has, through the bleſſing of heaven, ſuch ſalutary effects as theſe upon the people, then the Son of God is ſpiritually preſent with them in his houſe of worſhip. So when the Lord's ſupper adminiſtered in his houſe, is a mean of promoting the ſpiritual good of thoſe that partake of it, then they may be ſaid to enjoy the preſence of Chriſt with them in his houſe of worſhip. This ordinance is to be kept up in the church of Chriſt, and will be until his ſecond coming. The deſign of this ordinance is to keep up in our ſouls, a lively, heart-affecting and ſoul profiting remembrance of the dying love of Jeſus. 'Tis deſigned to be a public teſtimony, of our communion with the great head of the church. 1 Cor. 10, 16. The cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the blood of Chriſt? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt? 'Tis deſigned to excite our love and gratitude to Jeſus the prince of peace, who lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, and gave his life a ranſom for us. 'Tis
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012464_0016_0F89C9E68132DAB0"/>
deſigned to excite our love and gratitude to Jeſus, the Prince of Peace, who loved us, and gave his life a ranſom for us. 'Tis deſigned as an indication of our communion with fellow Saints, and of our love and charity towards them. 'Tis deſigned to increaſe our faith, to enkindle our repentance, and to quicken and animate us, to new and holy obedience. And when 'tis a mean of promoting theſe gracious purpoſes, then do his people enjoy the preſence of the glorious Redeemer with them. Yes, profeſſing chriſtians, when the Son of God meets you at his table, and there vouchſafes to admit you to communion with him, and when your ſouls are refreſhed, quicken'd and edified, at his table, and your grace enliven'd, it may well be ſaid, you enjoy the preſence of Chriſt. The ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual preſence of the Son of God at his table, is all that we are to expect or ſeek after: And we may not imagine, as the Papiſts do, that the bread and wine after they are conſecrated, are changed into the real body and blood of Chriſt. His preſence at his ſupper, has reſpect to our faith. He is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to them that do not behold him by faith, but only to them who fiducially behold his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, through the elements, and ſuch, and ſuch only, have communion with him. And thus Chriſt is ſpiritually preſent with his people at his table, when the holy ordinance is thus made beneficial to the ſouls of men. And thus we ſee what it is to enjoy the ſpiritual preſence of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in his houſe of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:012464_0017_0F89C9E750A732E8"/>
II. <hi>I ſhall now attempt to ſhew, what a people muſt do, in order to enjoy the ſpiritual preſence of Chriſt, in his houſe of worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed, they can do nothing to merit this ineſtimable favour. But yet ſome duties are incumbent on them, the performance of which is the moſt probable way to have Chriſt, of his abundant grace and mercy, meet with them in his houſe, and own, and bleſs them there, and manifeſt himſelf unto them. And,</p>
               <p n="1">1. In order to enjoy the ſpiritual preſence of Jeſus Chriſt in his houſe, the worſhippers ſhould ſee to it that they have love and charity for one another. If you come to the houſe of God with your hearts full of allowed mali<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> envy and hatred towards any of your fellow worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, you have no reaſon to think you ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the preſence of Chriſt; ſuch diſturbing paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the ſoul, do mightily unfit for the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ſervice of the ſanctuary, and eſpecially that part of it, <abbr>viz.</abbr> public prayer, <hi>If you for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give not men their treſpaſſes,</hi> how can you expect <hi>your heavenly father will forgive you your treſpaſſes?</hi> Not that barely our forgiving our fellow men any injuries they have done to us, entitles us to the forgiveneſs of the ſins we have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt God, but ſuch is the conſtitution of the goſpel, that while we are deſtitute of a forgiving temper towards our fellow men, it leaves us no grounds to expect forgiveneſs from God. No religious duty is acceptable to God
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012464_0018_0F89C9E803DEB130"/>
without charity, God will not hear the prayers of thoſe who cultivate in their hearts hatred, envy, ill-will and malice towards their fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. Mat. vi. 15. <hi>But if ye forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither</hi> will <hi>your father forgive your treſpaſſes. If thou remembreſt that thy brother hath ought againſt thee,</hi> faith our bleſſed Lord, <hi>leave thy gift before the altar—firſt be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</hi> 
                  <q>No endowments and qualifications of nature, no pretended zeal for the doctrines of religion, will attone for the want of charity and love.</q> 
                  <hi>If we could ſpeak with the tongues of men and angels, and have not charity, we are but like a ſounding braſs, and a tinkling cymbal. Though we have the gift of propheſy, and underſtand all myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and all knowledge; and though we have faith, ſo as to remove mountains, and have not charity, we are nothing.</hi> Nay, <hi>tho' we beſtow all our goods to feed the poor, and give our bodies to be burned, and have not charity, we are nothing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Would a people enjoy the preſence of Chriſt in his houſe of worſhip, they muſt come up to worſhip in his temple with right views &amp; aims, &amp; thoſe are, that they may truly glorify God, and receive ſpiritual peace and benefit to their own ſouls. God is infinitely the greateſt, and infinitely the beſt of <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                     <desc>••••</desc>
                  </gap>gs and infinitely worthy of the higheſt praiſes of men and angels, it is therefore highly reaſonable, that our high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt aim ſhould be his glory. Not that we worms of the duſt can add any thing to the eſſential
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012464_0019_0F89C9E8C2E47698"/>
glory of God, who is an all-perfect being, and the ſame yeſterday, to day and forever. But by public worſhip, we acknowledge his glorious excellencies, we hereby own his being, his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, his glory and excellency, and do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſpread abroad, the glory and honour of his name—we hereby ſignify our belief, of our dependence upon God for all bleſſings ſpiritual and temporal. We hereby own our obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to love and ſerve, and obey the great and eternal God. And God is pleaſed to account himſelf honoured, by the ſocial worſhip of his people in the temple, when 'tis performed in ſpirit and truth. As the glory of God ſhould be the chief view of our coming up to the houſe of the Lord for ſocial worſhip, ſo our own ſpiritual good, may lawfully be our ſubordinate view. We ſhould come up to the houſe of the Lord with fervent deſires, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt would meet with us and bleſs us: that he would bleſs the proviſion of his houſe, to our ſpiritual good. God declared of old, that in all places where he ſhould record his name, he would come unto them and bleſs them. The inſtitutions of public worſhip, are deſigned for the good of ſouls, and no doubt, thouſands and thouſands have found ſaving benefit by them, and God is ſtill able to make them beneficial to ſouls, for his hand is not ſhortned that it cannot ſave, nor his ear heavy that it cannot hear. So that we may rightly have a ſubordinate view, to our own ſpiritual good, by coming up to the houſe of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:012464_0020_0F89C9E9C01C7528"/>
3. Would a people enjoy the ſpiritual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt in his houſe, they muſt ſincerely implore and ardently plead for it. All ſhould in ſecret on the Lord's day, previous to their going up to the houſe of the Lord, ardently im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the gracious preſence of Jeſus, that they and his worſhiping aſſembly may be favoured with it that day. They ſhould earneſtly pray that Chriſt would meet with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> own and bleſs them. And his people in his houſe of prayer, ſhould unitedly implore his gracious preſence: the houſe of God, where his people meet together for ſolemn worſhip, is called the houſe of prayer. Mat. xxi, 13. This is the courſe a people muſt purſue, would they hopefully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the glorious preſence of Chriſt with them, in his houſe of worſhip, would they have him meet them there and own and bleſs them.</p>
               <p>III. <hi>I would in a few words attempt to ſhew, why a people ought moſt earneſtly to deſire the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al preſence of Chriſt in his houſe of worſhip. And the reaſons I ſhall offer are two.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Without the preſence of Chriſt in his houſe, he is not truly honored there. The Lord of glory is no further honoured, by our coming up to his houſe for worſhip, than his preſence is enjoyed there. We have heard what it is to enjoy the preſence of Chriſt in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn aſſembly, and this is enjoyed, when he owns the public ordinances, and makes them means of good to precious ſouls. When ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are convinced, when they are converted,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012464_0021_0F89C9EC325A55C8"/>
when ſaints are edified, when they have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God and Chriſt. Now 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that the Lord Jeſus is not honoured, when his preſence in neither of theſe reſpects is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, and 'tis but a dull, lifeleſs formal ſervice at beſt, that is paid to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Without the preſence of Chriſt in his houſe, our own ſouls are not truly profited, and we make no advance at all towards the heavenly world. If we enjoy nothing of the preſence of Chriſt, we make no advance at all in religion: if the preſence of Chriſt is not his houſe, no part of inſtituted worſhip will be of any ſaving good, to any ſoul. The preacher in this view, preaches in vain, no good will follow without the divine bleſſing. No good fruit will follow. Without the preſence of Chriſt, ſinners will not be really and truly convinced of their ſin and danger, ſinners will not be converted, neither will the children of God be edified and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor will immortal ſouls be ſavingly profited, and therefore you ſee a people ought moſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to deſire, and ſeek after the ſpiritual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt in his houſe of worſhip. Becauſe without this, the Lord of glory is not truly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured, and becauſe without this gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt, our own ſouls are not truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefited.</p>
               <p>IV. <hi>The preſence of Chriſt in his houſe of worſhip is truly its greateſt glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>True it is, that the firſt temple, in itſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, was much more ſplendid and magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012464_0022_0F89C9ECF7B250E8"/>
than the ſecond, it was adorned and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with gold, ſo as the latter was not. Yet the inſpired writer tells us, the glory of the latter houſe ſhould be the greateſt; and why? Becauſe the Son of God, the Prince of Peace, that glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and divine perſon, in the days of his huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, ſhould make his appearance there. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text vi vii verſes. For thus, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, yet once, it is a little while, and I will ſhake the heavens and the earth, and the ſea, and the dry land: and I will ſhake all nations, and the deſire of all nations ſhall come, and I will fill this houſe with glory, faith the Lord of hoſts. The enemies of the Jews, no doubt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided them, reproached them, and caſt contempt upon them, and upon the houſe they were build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But the prophet by God's direction, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts them with theſe conſiderations, that the Lord would fill the houſe with glory, and that although this houſe had not ſo much ſilver and gold upon it as Solomon's temple had, yet ſtill its glory ſhould be greater. And why? Becauſe the preſence of Chriſt the glorious Redeemer, the Prince of Peace ſhould be enjoyed there. What are outward ornaments, compared with the ſpiritual preſence of the Redeemer? They are ſurely nothing in worth and excellency. What are large and ſpacious buildings? What is ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant architecture? What are whited walls? What are paintings and carvings? Are the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of theſe any thing, compared to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the preſence of the Son of God, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012464_0023_0F89C9EEEE69F158"/>
of Iſrael in his houſe? No, they are by no means to be compared with it for real worth and glory. The whole congregation may be ſtupid, unedified, unprofited, let the houſe itſelf be never ſo elegant and grand, outward orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments add no power to divine inſtitutions. But where the preſence of Chriſt is enjoyed, ſome good is done to precious ſouls, they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, converted or edified, light and truth is enjoyed, and ſouls are help'd forward towards the new Jeruſalem. So that 'tis plain this is greater, infinitely greater glory, than any exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal glory of the houſe: I don't mean ſo much as to intimate, that people ſhould not be ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous what kind of houſes they build for public worſhip, theſe ought to be decent and elegant, and at leaſt more magnificent than our common dwelling-houſes. And when people are ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious in building ſuch houſes, ambitious accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their abilities, to have them ſtately, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent and ornamental, 'tis truly a laudale tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. But it remains true ſtill, that the preſence of Chriſt in his houſe of worſhip, is really its greateſt glory. The external glory of this houſe is vaſtly greater than the external glory of that which we have now left, and are probably no more publickly to worſhip in. Yet if leſs of the preſence of Chriſt is enjoyed here, than has been there, it will be in a ſenſe true, that the glory of that houſe is the greateſt. But if more of the preſence of Chriſt is ever enjoyed here, than has been there, it will be emphatically true,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:012464_0024_0F89C9EF76C98728"/>
that the glory of this latter houſe is greater than that of the former. Nothing is ſo ornamental to the ſoul as grace is. The graces of the ſpirit implanted there, are its greateſt beauty, inconceivably greater than natural endowments. So the greateſt glory of the houſe appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated to public worſhip, is the ſpiritual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Jeſus there, his ſpeaking peace there to his people. 'Tis this makes it a nurſery for heaven.</p>
               <p>Thus I have endeavoured to illuſtrate the general obſervation. What now remains is by way of</p>
            </div>
            <div type="improvement">
               <head>IMPROVEMENT.</head>
               <p n="1">1. We may hence be led to admire the grace of Chriſt, that he will afford his preſence to worſhipping aſſemblies here below. It was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding great grace and condeſcention in the eternal Son of God, to take our nature upon him, and in this nature to viſit this ſinful and fallen world—to obey the law, and to ſubmit to the ignominious death of the croſs, that he might open a way for our return to God, of our enjoying peace with him, and of our being fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally happy in his preſence, in whoſe preſence is fullneſs of joy. And 'tis grace in the Son of God, now he is aſcended up on high, now he is exalted at the right hand of the Father, now he receives the praiſes of ſaints and angels in the heavenly world, to vouchſafe his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual preſence to worſhipping aſſemblies in this

world. But though he is aſcended on high, yet ſtill he cares for the church on earth, he keeps it and waters it every moment. He of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten draws near to his people, when they eſſay to draw near to him in the ſolemn aſſembly, and owns them there, and meets them with a divine bleſſing, comes in and ſups with them, and they with him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We hence ſee how cautious all ſhould be, leſt they do any thing that ſhall provoke the Son of God to deny his preſence in his houſe of worſhip. We ſhould beware we don't do this, by introducing any thing into his worſhip that he don't require, or that is contrary to his will. We are to adhere to the things which Chriſt has inſtituted. We ſhould take heed that we don't provoke Chriſt to deny his preſence, by coldneſs, indifferency and formality in his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. We ſhould take heed that we don't, by neglecting to implore, and earneſtly ſeek his preſence. We ſhould beware we don't, by an uncharitable, unforgiving temper and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards our fellow-worſhippers. Let all take heed that they do nothing to provoke the Lord of glory to deny his ſpiritual preſence in his houſe of worſhip. Remember without his preſence, Chriſt is not truly honor'd, and your own ſouls are not truly bettered.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence ſee how ungrateful they are to Chriſt, and careleſs of their own ſouls, who neglect public worſhip. The worſhipping aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:012464_0026_0F89C9F218768ED8"/>
are ſadly negled by multitudes at this day. An evidence this, of the ſad decay of godlineſs. Had perſons a due ſenſe of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of this duty, had they but a right concern for their ſouls, had they but a right ſenſe of the worth of them; they could not live in the neglect of this important duty, but would be ſwift to hear the goſpel preached—'Tis owing to the ſingular bleſſing of heaven, that the goſpel is put into our hands, which acquaints us with the great things of our peace, a bleſſing denied to multitudes, who are now periſhing for lack of viſion. 'Tis an illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſplay of grace in the Prince of Peace, that he is ſending his ambaſſadors, to beſeech and perſuade us to be reconciled unto God, and that we have a free and undiſturbed acceſs to the houſe of God. A preached goſpel is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to do good to ſouls, and no doubt but thouſands and thouſands have been really and ſavingly benefited by it. Faith comes by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and hearing, by the word of God. How ungrateful then, are ſuch to Chriſt, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of their own ſouls, who careleſsly neglect the public worſhip of God? They pour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon Chriſt's own inſtitution, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the Holy One, who is well acquainted with all their ways, to ſay concerning them, <hi>my ſpirit ſhall not ſtrive with them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. We may at this time reflect with grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, that the people in this land have been ſo ſpirited to build houſes to worſhip God in, and
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:012464_0027_0F89C9F2774BF1E0"/>
that they have enjoyed ſo much of the preſence of Chriſt. As the profeſſed deſign of our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers, in coming into this land, then a howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wilderneſs, was the more free enjoyment of religion, according to the dictates of their own conſciences; ſo the form of religion has all along been kept up, and no doubt much of the preſence of Chriſt has been enjoyed, much of the power of religion has been viſible, and God has all along, from generation to generation, had a number that were a people for his praiſe. In this land, the goſpel has been preached in the purity of it. The people from generation to generation, have been ſpirited to build de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent houſes for public worſhip, ſpirited to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the goſpel, and to keep up the worſhip of God.—This has been the caſe in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and eſpecially in theſe New-England colonies.—And God has ſmiled upon worſhipping aſſemblies from time to time, and no doubt bleſs'd the proviſion of his houſe, to thouſands who are now rejoicing in glory; and bleſs'd it to the ſaving benefit of thouſands who are now his obedient ſervants on earth, and are meetning and preparing for eternal glory.—Theſe things call for a grateful remembrance. Theſe things call for ſincere and ardent gratitude to the great Father of Lights, from whom comes down every good and perfect gift. And in this view of the caſe, we may well ſay, <hi>The lines are fallen to us in a pleaſant place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would particularly addreſs myſelf, in the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012464_0028_0F89C9F335D04A78"/>
next place, to the people of this church and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Dearly Beloved,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is both a joyful and ſolemn occaſion we are this day met upon; no leſs than to dedicate and conſecrate this houſe, erected for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of public worſhip, to the uſe and ſervice of the great and eternal God, and likewiſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently to implore his gracious acceptance of it, as a place where he will record his name, and where he will give peace. O! that every knee may bow in ſubjection to God, and every heart be devoutly engaged in a free ſurrender up of this houſe, to the uſe and ſervice of the mighty God. And let every heart be engaged, in devout ejaculations to God, that he would gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly accept our offering, and that he would record his name here, and that in this place he would give peace.</p>
               <p>You have reaſon, great reaſon to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the great Father of Mercies, that you have deen proſpered in your undertaking, and that your eyes this day behold ſuch a ſtately building, now decently finiſhed, and ſo well formed for the pious uſe to which it is deſigned. Let every heart be filled with gratitude to God, from whom all our temporal, as well as ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al bleſſings flow. And while you eſſay to dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this houſe to God, remember of his own you offer. When pious David and his princes had offer'd vaſt ſums for the ſervice of the houſe of God, they freely acknowledge of his own
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:012464_0029_0F89C9F3F3C34FF0"/>
they had given him. 1 Chron. xxix. 14—16. <q>But who am I, and what is my people, that we ſhould be able to offer ſo willingly, after this ſort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee. O Lord our God, all this ſtore that we have prepared to build thee an houſe for thine holy name, cometh of thine hand &amp; is all thine own.</q> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon when he had finiſhed the temple, made a free ſurrender of it up to God, and God teſtified his acceptance of it by a cloud's filling the houſe of the Lord. He approves of the building and finiſhing of the temple, as a ſervice done to his great and glorious name, and to his kingdom among men. He alſo teſtified his acceptance of it, as a place where he would record his name, and where he would meet with his people and own and bleſs them, by the fire which came down from heaven, and conſumed the burnt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and the ſacrifices. Yea, God expreſly tells king Solomon, he had heard his prayer, and that he had hallowed the houſe which he had built, to put his name there. And as you would have the mighty God accept of this houſe as his, as you would have him record his name here, as you would have him give peace in this place, then, from your hearts, make a free and cordial ſurrender up of this houſe to God, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his preſence here, implore his acceptance of it, as a place where he will record his name. And having dedicated the houſe to God, beware you don't provoke him to forſake it, by forſak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:012464_0030_0F89C9F4FAB53878"/>
of it yourſelves. Beware you don't, by your coldneſs and indifferency, in the duties of the ſanctuary when you do attend. Beware you don't, by trifling with the ſolemn means of grace. Beware you don't by cenſoriouſneſs, by unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſs, and an unforgiving temper towards one another. You are ſenſible what long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts and debates you have formerly had, about the place where to erect the houſe, and no doubt, as you have been of very oppoſite and different ſentiments, ſo you have had hard thoughts of one-another, uncharitableneſs and cenſoriouſneſs towards one-another, and no doubt, this differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in ſentiments, has given riſe to a ſad decay of that brotherly love, which ought to ſubſiſt between members of the ſame ſociety. Now, my advice to all is, to put away all bitterneſs, and wrath, and evil-ſpeaking, and to put on bowels of love and charity towards one-another, and ſtudy to live in love and peace, that your prayers be not hindred. Don't pollute the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip here, by harbouring any envy or ill-will, towards any that you think have been too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and too engaged to get the houſe erected where it now ſtands. On the other hand, don't pollute the worſhip here, by harbouring any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable diſpoſition, towards thoſe who you imagine have unreaſonably oppoſed the erecting of the houſe in this place. And let all put on that charity which is the bond of perfectneſs, that charity which hopeth all things, which put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the moſt favourable conſtruction, upon the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012464_0031_0F89C9F5962D0C38"/>
words and actions of men. Here meet as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren who profeſs the ſame religion. Here meet as brethren who profeſs to worſhip the God of peace and order. Here meet as bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren who profeſs to be ſeeking the ſame hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly inheritance. Here ſtrive together in prayer according to God's direction. Here unite in ſongs of praiſe, to him who inhabits the praiſes of Iſrael. You have been at much coſt to erect and finiſh this houſe, and as you would now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the ſpiritual preſence of Chriſt here, which is the greateſt glory of the temple, which is the greateſt glory of the inner temple, the ſoul of man, then let this be a houſe of prayer, and a houſe of praiſe. Here be ſwift to hear the word, and ready to receive inſtruction. Here attend with ſteadineſs, with ſincerity and devotion.—Keep your feet when you go to the houſe of God, and be more ready to hear than to give the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of fools. Would you have God meet you here, and own and bleſs you? Then here ſeek his preſence with earneſtneſs and ſincerity. Would you have the proviſion of the houſe bleſs'd to ſpiritual purpoſes? Then humbly and ſincerely look to God for it. Be ſtrict to adhere to the inſtitutions of divine worſhip. The ſanctity and purity of the church, and its ſtrict adherence to divine inſtitutions, is much more its glory and ornament, than external pomp and ſplendor. It is truly deſirable to have the preſence of Chriſt in this houſe of worſhip, to have him own and bleſs, to ſpiritual purpoſes, the proviſion of
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012464_0032_0F89C9F769EA1E28"/>
his houſe, to have him pour out his ſpirit here, for the conviction and converſion of ſinners, and for the edification and comfort of ſaints. Surely this is what we ought all of us to deſire, this is what we ought earneſtly to ſeek after, this more than any external pomp and ſplendor, is the true glory of the houſe. And notwithſtanding this houſe vaſtly excels that which we have now left, (which has long been a houſe of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) in outward ſplendor and magnificence, yet if more of the preſence of Jeſus is ever enjoyed here, than has been there, it will be emphatically true, that the glory of this latter houſe is the greateſt. As ſinners would be awakned and converted, and made partakers of a ſpiritual life, as ſaints would be edified and comforted, as they would increaſe in purity and holineſs, then let them take heed, that they dont forſake the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling themſelves together, for the purpoſe of ſocial worſhip, as the manner of ſome is, but wait at wiſdom's gates, and watch at the poſts of her doors. In a word, <q>would you grow in knowledge and grace? Would you be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to worſhip with an innumerable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of angels, and in the general aſſembly of the firſt born above, than which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more deſirable? then with frequency and delight, repair to the tabernacle of God, the congregations of his people here on earth, for theſe are nurſeries for heaven.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, <hi>a few words of exhortation to the whole auditory conclude the preſent diſcourſe.</hi>

You have heard how the preſence of Chriſt adorns the temple, and this is the greateſt orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the ſoul can have. The lovely graces of ſpirit, love, joy, peace, gentleneſs, meekneſs and temperance, do mightily embelliſh, and adorn the ſoul of man. 'Tis your higheſt intereſt and glory, to be like Chriſt in purity and holineſs, and to be imitators of him, in meekneſs and lowlineſs of heart. It nearly concerns you to have intereſt in him, who ſaves his people from the ſecond death, and to ſtand related to him as a Saviour and Redeemer, and as his loyal ſubjects and Servants. He is the way, the truth and the life: neither is there ſalvation in any other: our glory and happineſs ariſes from our relation to Chriſt, our likeneſs to him, intereſt in him, and communion with him. The ſoul in which the Son of God has ſet up his kingdom, the ſoul in which he dwells by his ſpirit, the ſoul which he has adorn'd with the lovely train of chriſtian graces, is more beautiful and glorious than ever Solomon's temple was, and will be ſo through the never ending ages of eternity. Let all then ſee to it, that they cordially receive Chriſt as their Lord and Saviour, that they bow the knee in ſubjection to him who is King in Zion, that they be his obedient ſubjects and ſervants, and that they worſhip the Lord with ſincerity and pure devotion, in his temples here below, that ſo they may be prepared to worſhip in the temple above, which endures for ever and ever, than which nothing is more deſirable.</p>
