            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE reverend and learned <hi>Author</hi> of the ensuing Discourses needs not any <hi>Epistles of Commendation</hi> to such as are acquainted with his Person and Character: <hi>Whose Praise is in the Gospel thorowout all the Churches</hi> in those remote parts, where Divine Providence has cast his Lot. Neither is he unknown to the Publick: which has been fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd with several lesser Writings of his, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly publish'd on special Occasions; that must have left on the Minds of those who have read them, a grateful Relish, and such an Idea of Mr. <hi>Dickinson</hi>'s peculiar Genius, Capacity and Iudgment, as cannot but prepare them to come with raised Expectations and a particular Gust, to the Perusal of the following Tracts: Which it would therefore be as superfluous to recommend to <hi>such,</hi> as it would be thought vain in me to attempt a profuse Encomium on them for the sake of <hi>others;</hi> nor indeed would the known Modesty of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor indulge me in taking this Liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ii" facs="unknown:003527_0003_0FF857E482E06788"/>Only I must be permitted to say, that in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these Sheets I have thought my self very agreably entertain'd, with the Variety and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass of Thought, Excellency of Matter, Strength of Argument, and Vivacity of Expression. And I must needs think, every serious discerning Reader will find the Beams of Divine Light, shining round the Gospel-Revelation, collected here in so close a Union, and borne in upon him with such a Force, as cannot fail (with a common blessing) to give Heat and Energy to Faith and Love, establish him in the principles and duties of Christianity, and guard him against the Attacks of Infidelity on all sides.</p>
            <p>The general Design of these Papers is suggest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Title of 'em; yet it mayn't be improper to open the way to the reading them, by exhibiting a brief <hi>Scheme</hi> of the whole Work.</p>
            <p>The <hi>first</hi> Sermon is on <hi>the Being and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of GOD.</hi> Where we are led into deep and entertaining Contemplations upon the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; by a particular View of the eminent Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of GOD, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> they are illustrated in the Works of <hi>Creation:</hi> and have laid before us very plentiful and irresistible Convictions of <hi>his eternal Power and Godhead,</hi> to the utter Confusion of all <hi>atheistical</hi> Pretences.</p>
            <p>The <hi>second</hi> Sermon gives us the rational Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of <hi>our Apostacy from GOD:</hi> and then carries us into a delightful Meditation on <hi>our Recovery by a Mediator;</hi> producing a Variety of presumptive Arguments, many fair and live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Characters of <hi>Probability,</hi> that attend the <hi>Christian</hi> Institution: its unparallel'd intrinsick
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:003527_0003_0FF857E482E06788"/>
Excellencies are consider'd; its perfect Congruity to all the Divine Prerogatives, and Illustration of the Attributes of GOD; its Correspondence to the Nature and Necessities of Man, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duciveness to our present Welfare and future ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Happiness, are set in View; and a numerous Train of Arguments drawn together in a compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensive and perspicuous manner, that deserve a very attentive Consideration, and which would have admitted of a copious Display, had not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed Brevity oblig'd our Author to restrain his Pen.</p>
            <p>The <hi>other</hi> Discourses point out to us the <hi>one Mediator</hi> between GOD and Men, <hi>the Man</hi> CHRIST IESUS; and by many infallible Proofs demonstrate, that <hi>he</hi> is the true <hi>Messiah,</hi> to the manifest Confutation and Shame of all <hi>Deisti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Exceptions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>third</hi> Sermon considers the Evidence from <hi>Prophecy</hi>: explains the <hi>Nature</hi> of a Prophecy, as it is to be understood in the present Argument; sets forth the <hi>various Ways,</hi> in which Divine Predictions may be said to be <hi>fulfilled; instances</hi> in some of the more signal Prophecies of the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> relating to the <hi>Messiah,</hi> his Person and Character, the Time, Circumstances, and Consequents of his Appearing; then shews from the Evangelical <hi>Historians,</hi> that they have been literally and exactly <hi>verify'd</hi> in IESUS <hi>of Nazareth:</hi> And finally, to compleat the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration, it is shewn, that as the <hi>Accomplishment</hi> of those ancient Prophecies is a certain Indication of their <hi>Divine Original,</hi> so the <hi>united</hi> Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment of them all in the blessed IESUS is
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:003527_0004_0FF857E6EE765920"/>
a loud Testimony from Heaven, that <hi>he</hi> is the <hi>predicted Saviour,</hi> and justifies his Claim to the high Titles, Perfections and Relations, attributed to the Messiah in the <hi>prophetick Descriptions</hi> of his Person and Kingdom; all which, being of a Divine Extraction, consequently plead a Divine Veracity.</p>
            <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> and last Sermon is upon the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from <hi>Miracles.</hi> Where we have the correct <hi>Notion</hi> of a Miracle briefly stated: In the next place Matter of <hi>Fact</hi> asserted, that there were <hi>true</hi> and proper Miracles wrought by our Lord IESUS CHRIST, in his own Person, and by his Apostles in his Name: Then it's shown how those miraculous Operations illustrate the Verity of his <hi>Divine Mission,</hi> and the Certainty of his being the promised <hi>Messiah</hi> (in Attestation to which Character, assumed by him and ascrib'd to him, they were all perform'd) and so infer, by a just Consequence, the Truth and heavenly Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> that admirable Collection of Divine Revelations; which being written by inspir'd Penmen, has been preserv'd and transmitted in authentick Copies, without any material depravation, down to the present Age.</p>
            <p>Finally, the Author having thus demonstrated the Divine Authority and Reasonableness of the Christian Institution, shuts up the whole with some wise and good <hi>Rules,</hi> to settle the Minds of wavering Professors, and direct Persons convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the Truth of Christianity in general (but at a Loss, among the various Divisions of <hi>Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendom,</hi> which Persuasion or Party to joyn with) how they may resolve their Doubts, fix their
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:003527_0004_0FF857E6EE765920"/>
Choice, and determine in what particular <hi>Way, Mode</hi> or <hi>Form,</hi> they may best serve CHRIST, to his Acceptance, and their own eternal Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
            <p>Thus I have given the Reader a short and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Table of <hi>Contents;</hi> a View of the principal Scope and Tenor of the Discourses here exhibited to the publick Light.—They are surely upon the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest <hi>Subjects,</hi> sublime in their Nature, useful in their Tendency, and seasonable for this sceptical Day. And by a particular Application of them to the Ends of <hi>Practice</hi> and <hi>Devotion,</hi> which runs through and enlivens the Work, it is adapted to impress and engage the Heart, as well as em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the Mind; to warm the Christian, as well as please and improve the Scholar.</p>
            <p>In perusing this little Volume, the Reader must summon his thinking Powers to a vigorous At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and call up his most devout Reflections: The seriousness of the Theme demands the latter; and the Variety, as well as Connexion of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the former. And when you have delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted over the following pages, I doubt not you'll be ready to break out in the Language of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle; <hi>This is a faithful Saying, and worthy of all Acceptation, that CHRIST JESUS came into the World to save Sinners.—Without Controversy great is the Mystery of Godliness: GOD was manifest in the Flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of Angels, preached unto the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, believed on in the World, received up into Glory.</hi>—And <hi>GOD forbid, that I should glory, save in the Cross of our Lord JESUS CHRIST.</hi>

            <p>You will find, that the only wise GOD our Saviour has taken <hi>all possible Care for our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> in the Certainty of reveal'd Religion, and does not challenge our Belief of the Gospel, without giving us sufficient Grounds; whether in regard of the internal Signatures of Truth and Reason inseparable from it, or the external Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Credibility that accompany it: which consider'd together, do put it beyond all rational Doubt, and must needs produce a moral Assurance of its heavenly Original, in every one that will allow himself carefully and impartially to examine the Credentials it brings with it.</p>
            <p>Sure I am, You will see all the <hi>Marks of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity</hi> most evident on the Christian Institution: and cannot doubt but you will be ready to say with the Apostle, <hi>I am not ashamed of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of CHRIST: Tho' I suffer Reproach as a Christian, nevertheless I am not ashamed; for I know whom I have believed.</hi> -You will see the Apostle had good Grounds for that Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Be not ashamed of the Testimony of our Lord, nor of me his Prisoner.</hi>

runs Counter to them, but because his <hi>Lusts</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul his Reason and debauch his Iudgment, sin a depraved Bias upon his Will, and commit a Rape on his Conscience, by their infatuating Charms. Hence it may be observed, these Latitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarian Moralists are generally as libertine in their Practice, as in their Belief, and shew as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the Man, as they pretend of the Christian.</p>
            <p>Again, <hi>You will be asham'd</hi> of those throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Herds in Christendom, of <hi>unprincipl'd implicit Believers,</hi> who are so supinely negligent and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant in Divine Things, that they take the Christian Profession upon blind <hi>Trust,</hi> and not out of Conviction and rational Choice; stupidly led by Education, popular Fashion, publick Esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishment, Antiquity, or the like ignoble Attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives: without acquainting themselves with the illustrious Proofs of the Divine Authority of the Gospel, or indeed with its important Informations. So that they are <hi>unskilful in the Word of Righteousness; have need that one teach them which be the first Principles of the Oracles of GOD;</hi> and have nothing or little more to plead for Christianity, than a <hi>Turk</hi> for the Alcoran, or an <hi>Heathen</hi> for his national and antique Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition: while yet the Religion of Christians admits of the most rational and ample Apology.

            <p>In fine, I will say to every <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>pious</hi> Christian, You will upon a serious Review be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sham'd even of <hi>yourselves</hi> also; from a Consciousness of your being <hi>so unstudy'd</hi> in the glorious Gospel, its rich Contents and numerous Proofs; <hi>so unfur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd</hi> for the Vindication of your holy Religion against the Assaults of its many Opposers; <hi>so unaffected</hi> with the amazing Grace of God in the Evangelical Dispensation, its transcendent Fulness of Light and Glory, its extensive Spread among the Gentiles, and yet the astonishing Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of Providence, in revealing it to some while it's hid from others;—<hi>so unthankful</hi> for its great and precious Promises, and incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Benefits; <hi>so infirm</hi> in your belief of its pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Discoveries, and soon shaken in Mind by the impotent Cavils of various Seducers; <hi>so wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering</hi> and languid in your religious Resolutions; <hi>so remiss</hi> in your Endeavours of Obedience to its
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:003527_0008_0FF857EE93FF79F0"/>
excellent Precepts; <hi>so indolent</hi> and careless about the Propagation of Christian Knowlege, among such as sit in Darkness and are perishing for lack of Vision, while you sit under a meridian shine of the Sun of Righteousness.</p>
            <p>In a word, You will be asham'd that you have so little of an <hi>experimental</hi> sense of the Power and Truth of the Gospel; and that you are no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter able to set a <hi>Seal</hi> hereto, from your own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal and lively Experience of that <hi>Communion</hi> with <hi>CHRIST</hi> (in his Word and Ordinances) which is so congenerous to the <hi>new Creature,</hi> so relishing to the spiritual Taste of a real Christian, so improving to Divine Knowlege and true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness; and the Want or low Degree whereof in many Professors is so justly the matter of our mournful Observation.</p>
            <p>I doubt not you will find <hi>such Reflections</hi> and <hi>Resentments</hi> awaken'd in you; while with a due Application of Mind and with serious Pauses, labouring to enter into the Spirit of the Author and Importance of the Subject, you peruse the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing argumentative and pathetick Defence of Christianity.

            <p>It should be our main Solicitude, our first Desire, that the SPIRIT of CHRIST may cause the Light of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Gospel to <hi>shine into our Hearts;</hi> and testify to its Verity and Divine Extract, by making it instrumental, through his concurrent Efficacy, to an indelible Impression of the <hi>Image</hi> of CHRIST on our Souls: And let it be our nex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To promote this experimental Religion, and spread the genuine Spirit and Practice of Christianity, is the ultimate Design of the following Essay on the Reasonableness of it. And to that happy End may the special Blessing of CHRIST, whose Cause is here espous'd, accompany it to all, int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to please God</hi>; and even of believing that first Article, That <hi>God is, as well as that He is a rewarder of those that diligently seek Him.</hi> Whence it follows, that He who has made us <hi>rational Creatures,</hi> expects from us a <hi>reasonable Service</hi>; and cannot be pleased with that faith, practice, or hope, that is grounded on <hi>education,</hi> or common opinion; and not the result of <hi>rational</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, or enquiry.</p>

[<hi>Are clearly seen</hi>] Though we can't soar to the interminable <hi>heights,</hi> or dive to the boundless <hi>depths,</hi> of this <hi>Infinite Nature</hi>; we have demonstrative evidence of His <hi>Eternal Power and Godhead,</hi> with many of his essential perfections.

Truth, &amp;c. tho' we know not the manner of His <hi>existence,</hi> and operations.</p>

            <p n="1">I. I think it unquestionably <hi>evident</hi> to all men, that they <hi>themselves</hi> have a <hi>Being.</hi> This case admits of no debate; no man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing capable to call in question his <hi>own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence,</hi> or doubt of his <hi>Being.</hi> Whence,</p>
            <p n="2">II. IT is equally <hi>certain</hi> to every man, that he has not <hi>always</hi> been, what he now is. Within the compass of a few years, we were first begotten, conceiv'd, &amp; born; and have passed the several stages of time, unto the age, to which we are now arriv'd. This no man can doubt of.

that either the whole, or any part of it, should not have been, or have been any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise than it is. For, if not <hi>necessarily</hi> self-existent, it must derive its <hi>Being</hi> from some cause, and consequently have a <hi>begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:</hi> and it must also have continued by an <hi>Infinite</hi> and <hi>Eternal</hi> series and succession of <hi>necessary causes</hi> and <hi>effects.</hi> For if all the <hi>causes</hi> and <hi>effects</hi> in an <hi>eternally</hi> existing World, are not <hi>necessary,</hi> but contingent; that is, if they from their own nature might be, or might not be what they are: Then the <hi>World</hi> in all its glory and magnificence, in all the symmetry, order, and perfection of its several parts, has <hi>for ever</hi> continued by meer <hi>accident,</hi> without any cause or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: Which is the height of <hi>absurdity.</hi> This then is most certain, that if the <hi>World</hi> be <hi>Eternal,</hi> it derives both its <hi>being</hi> and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance from absolute <hi>necessity.</hi> —But is it not most <hi>absurd</hi> and unreasonable to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the <hi>necessary</hi> self-existence of things that are evidently in their own nature <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent</hi>; and for whose <hi>existence,</hi> there is no more apparent reason or necessity from the nature of the things themselves, than for their <hi>non-existence</hi>? Is it not even ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to imagine, that from the nature of things, the <hi>World</hi> must consist of just
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003527_0014_0FF857FF9CF03400"/>
so many, and just such kind of parts as it now does, without any possible addition, diminution, or alteration? That the <hi>Earth,</hi> for instance, could not have in its compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, one particle of sand more or less, than it has, nor produce one plant or ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, worm or fly, different from what it does? And yet this is the inevitable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of such <hi>necessity:</hi> For if the whole be <hi>necessary,</hi> every most minute particle is equally so.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, If the <hi>World</hi> be from its own nature <hi>necessary,</hi> it is every where necessary, to every point of real or imaginary <hi>space.</hi> For what may from the nature of the thing be absent from one <hi>place,</hi> may notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing any <hi>necessity</hi> to the contrary, be absent from any other, and consequently from every <hi>place.</hi> It being impossible that there should be any thing in one <hi>place</hi> more than another, to make it <hi>necessary.</hi> What therefore is <hi>necessary,</hi> must be every where so, and so be <hi>Infinite,</hi> as well as <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</hi> Nay and even every part and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the whole World, must by the same Argument be <hi>infinite</hi>: For there must be the same <hi>necessity</hi> for all the <hi>parts,</hi> as for the <hi>whole,</hi> as is before observ'd. Whence, there must be (upon this supposition) more

               <hi>Infinite Beings</hi> than there are atoms of sand, or rays of light: Which is the grossest <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AGAIN, If the <hi>World</hi> exist from <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity,</hi> and all the parts of it <hi>necessarily</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their various functions &amp; operations: Then it is also <hi>necessary</hi> that they for ever do so, without any diversity, variation or change. Nature must always act by inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable and immutable laws, in the same order, with the same force, and to the same effect. For what is from the nature of the thing <hi>necessary</hi> to day, will be so to morrow and <hi>for ever.</hi> And thus that man that <hi>necessarily</hi> lives to day, must by the same <hi>necessity</hi> live always; he that is in <hi>health</hi> to day must be so <hi>for ever.</hi> And in a word, there can be no <hi>change</hi> in any part of the Creation: which is so contrary to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant experience in this World of <hi>change,</hi> that it need not be insisted on.</p>
            <p>I will just mention one Argument more against the <hi>eternity</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> which possibly may be more intelligible, &amp; more adapted to the capacity of my <hi>hearers,</hi> than what I've already offered.</p>
            <p>THE supposition of the World's <hi>eternity</hi> does necessarily contradict the possibility of a <hi>succession</hi> in any thing whatsoever.

            <p>IF the World has had a <hi>beginning</hi> (as is demonstrated) there must have been some <hi>Author,</hi> some <hi>efficient cause,</hi> by which it was created and made.</p>

of, there is a new <hi>scene</hi> before us, which will captivate our <hi>understanding,</hi> and utterly lose our <hi>thoughts</hi>; they suppose the great multitude of <hi>fixed Stars</hi> to be so many <hi>Suns,</hi> all of 'em endued with native <hi>light</hi> and <hi>heat</hi>; of like Dimensions with our <hi>Sun</hi>; and each of 'em accompanied with a system of <hi>Planets,</hi> as our <hi>Sun</hi> is; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently each of 'em occupying as great a <hi>space,</hi> as was formerly supposed in the whole <hi>Firmament.</hi>—This account of the <hi>Universe</hi> makes it appear many thousand times greater than is ordinarily imagin'd, and should answerably excite our <hi>admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>praises</hi> of the glorious <hi>Creator</hi> and Contriver of such a <hi>magnificent World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT having thus long gazed at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious <hi>Masses</hi> of these <hi>heavenly Bodies,</hi> and the immeasurable <hi>space</hi> possess'd by them; it's time to apply these considerations to the present purpose, and see if we can't discover the <hi>Infiniteness</hi> of the <hi>Creator,</hi> from this view of the <hi>Heavenly regions</hi>: Which, if we will but open our eyes, must appear in the <hi>clearest light.</hi> For it's manifest to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very observation, that the <hi>Maker, Guide,</hi> and <hi>Governour</hi> of the <hi>Universe,</hi> must be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways <hi>present</hi> in every part of this incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible <hi>space</hi>; (He could not else have
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003527_0019_0FF812CA592A3708"/>
made, nor could He otherwise superintend, order, and direct all the parts, operations, and influences of this stately <hi>fabrick</hi>) which is impossible to conceive, of any but an <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BESIDES, He that <hi>made</hi> the <hi>World,</hi> must also of his free will and choice, have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered and appointed the <hi>place</hi> of its resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and nothing but His own <hi>pleasure</hi> could circumscribe it to these <hi>limits,</hi> or confine it to this particular <hi>space,</hi> in the <hi>boundless void,</hi> rather than any other. He must therefore Himself be equal to all <hi>space,</hi> whether real or imaginary; that is, He must be an <hi>Infinite Being,</hi> whom <hi>the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain,</hi> as 1 King. viii.27. Which was the thing to be prov'd. And thus we see the <hi>Immensity</hi> of that glorious <hi>Being,</hi> that <hi>sitteth upon the circle of the Earth, that stretcheth out the Heavens as a curtain; and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in,</hi> Isai xl.22.</p>
            <p>I might here have urg'd the <hi>simplicity</hi> and uncompounded Nature of <hi>GOD,</hi> as a further evidence of His <hi>Infinity</hi>: But this would be to go out of the way of my <hi>Text,</hi> which confines me to the consideration of the <hi>Divine Perfections,</hi> as visible in the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003527_0019_0FF812CA592A3708"/>
               <hi>works</hi> of <hi>Creation</hi>; and I think what is said is sufficient upon this Head. I therefore proceed.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. THE <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Godhead</hi> is also <hi>clearly seen from the works which are made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR if there were more <hi>Gods</hi> than <hi>One,</hi> they could not be <hi>Infinite</hi>; two <hi>infinites</hi> being a palpable contradiction: And if <hi>finite,</hi> they could not be the <hi>first cause</hi> of all things; as is before demonstrated.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, If there be more <hi>Gods</hi> than <hi>One,</hi> they must all be either <hi>supreme, subordinate,</hi> or <hi>co-ordinate.</hi> Two <hi>supreme Beings</hi> is a contradiction in terms: for either one must be <hi>superior,</hi> or both <hi>equal</hi>; and therefore neither <hi>supreme.</hi> A <hi>subordinate God</hi> must be himself <hi>dependent,</hi> and could not have all things <hi>depend</hi> upon him; or in other words, could not be the <hi>creator</hi> nor <hi>upholder</hi> of the World. It remains therefore, that if there be a <hi>plurality</hi> of <hi>Gods,</hi> they must be <hi>co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate,</hi> which is equally <hi>absurd:</hi> For were there several <hi>co-ordinate Gods,</hi> they must either create the World <hi>conjunctly</hi> or <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately</hi>; not <hi>conjunctly,</hi> for if they join'd together in Creating the World, they would all make but one <hi>first Cause,</hi> and each severally but part of the <hi>Cause</hi>; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing supposed, there could be no <hi>perfect
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003527_0020_0FF8580F708708E0"/>
Being,</hi> and consequently no <hi>God</hi>: Nor could a <hi>plurality</hi> of <hi>Gods</hi> make the World <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately</hi>; there would then be no <hi>first Cause</hi> of all, if each <hi>caused</hi> but a part of the World.</p>
            <p>I might further urge the <hi>Unity</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> from His <hi>necessary</hi> existence.—I have already demonstrated, that the <hi>first Cause</hi> of all things must be <hi>Eternally necessary</hi>: And nothing can be capable of plainer <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration</hi>; for if there ever had been a <hi>time</hi> wherein He had not <hi>existed,</hi> He could have had no <hi>existence</hi> to <hi>Eternity,</hi> unless we suppose a <hi>Cause</hi> of the <hi>first Cause,</hi> which is <hi>absurd.</hi>—Besides, if all things were <hi>created</hi> by Him, He must necessarily be Himself <hi>uncreated,</hi> and being <hi>uncreated</hi> He must necessarily be <hi>Eternal:</hi> For what at <hi>any time</hi> did not <hi>exist,</hi> can <hi>never</hi> come into Being without being <hi>created,</hi> either by it self or by something else. Now if we suppose <hi>God</hi> to have <hi>created Himself,</hi> we attribute to him <hi>action</hi> before <hi>existence</hi>; which is the grossest <hi>absurdity.</hi> If we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose Him <hi>created</hi> by any thing else, we suppose a <hi>Cause</hi> of the <hi>first Cause,</hi> as before. He must therefore be <hi>Eternally necessary</hi>; and consequently can be but <hi>One</hi>: For if it be possible that the World could be
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003527_0020_0FF8580F708708E0"/>
created by <hi>one Efficient Cause</hi> (which can't be doubted) there can be but one necessary <hi>cause</hi> of all things. Every thing else <hi>may</hi> be derivative and dependent, and therefore can't be <hi>necessary.</hi> Whence it's certain there can be but <hi>one God,</hi> who (as I've already prov'd) must be a <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Being.</hi>—Thus we have clearest evidence of that truth, Deut. vi.4. <hi>The Lord our God is one Lord.</hi> And of that 1 Cor. viii.6. <hi>But to us there is but one God the Father, of whom are all things, and we in Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">IX. IT is moreover apparent from the <hi>works of Creation,</hi> that this glorious <hi>GOD</hi> is an <hi>Omnipotent Being.</hi> I've already prov'd, that the <hi>Heavens</hi> and the <hi>Earth,</hi> in all their amazing magnificence, curious frame, and regular order, sprung out of <hi>nothing,</hi> at the powerful command of the great <hi>Creator.</hi> Wherefore since there is an infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance between perfectly <hi>nothing</hi> and any real <hi>Being,</hi> there must be <hi>Omnipotence</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd in this glorious work.

the most <hi>inferior</hi> creature; and therefore the vilest <hi>insect,</hi> or smallest particle of <hi>dust,</hi> could not be brought from <hi>non-entity</hi> into Being, but by an <hi>Omnipotent</hi> arm.—What a surprizing scene then do the <hi>Heavens</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> afford us of the great <hi>Creator's power?</hi> What less than an ALMIGHTY GOD could first find <hi>matter</hi> for an endless train of such <hi>vast bodies,</hi> and then compose the <hi>stately fabric!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND I might further observe, that the <hi>creation</hi> of the World cannot be the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the <hi>Creator's power</hi>: For if once possess'd of <hi>creating skill</hi> and <hi>ability,</hi> He must always retain it; and therefore could (had He pleased) have spent Millions of ages in <hi>creating new Worlds,</hi> until their number had exceeded the utmost stretch even of an <hi>Angel's</hi> thought.—And from this view of His <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> it also ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that he could (had it been His plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure) have <hi>created</hi> a like number of World<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>WE have already observ'd, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever perfection is found in the <hi>creature,</hi> must be first <hi>eminently</hi> in the <hi>Creator:</hi> For it's clearly evident, that what had its <hi>Being</hi> and <hi>beginning</hi> from another, must have all the <hi>properties</hi> of its <hi>Being</hi> from the same <hi>source.</hi> If we apply this to the present case, we shall find it necessary that He who has animated our dust and endued us with so much <hi>wisdom,</hi> must have more <hi>Wisdom</hi> in Himself than all the men in the World,
<q>since all depend upon Him, and can have no other ways of <hi>knowledge,</hi> or <hi>extent of power,</hi> than what He gives them.</q>
The same may be said with respect to all created <hi>Wisdom</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> which equally flows from the same <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> who must therefore Himself be <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely Wise.</hi>

            <p>THE glorious <hi>art</hi> and <hi>contrivance</hi> in the admirable frame of Nature, do likewise loudly proclaim the <hi>infinite Wisdom</hi> of the <hi>Creator</hi>; while the whole, and every part, do so visibly conspire to answer the great ends of their <hi>Being.</hi>—Should we confine our speculations to the most <hi>inferior</hi> parts

of the Creation only, how many marks of <hi>Divine Skill,</hi> that would nonplus the thoughts of the most sagacious enquirer, might be found in the least <hi>pebble!</hi> What a great variety of shapes, colours, smells, qualities, and uses, are there in the smallest <hi>herbs</hi> or <hi>flowers,</hi> not to be imitated nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven fully understood by <hi>created wisdom!</hi> And how are they propagated by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable <hi>seminal vertue!</hi> How curiously form'd, and admirably adapted to their several ends and uses, are the most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible <hi>insects</hi>!

            </p>
            <p>BUT if we continue our view, and lift up our eyes to the <hi>superior</hi> parts of the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>scene</hi> will yet further open, and

How else could they all <hi>subsist?</hi> And what else could keep them from <hi>destruction</hi> and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion?</hi>—Nay, had not all things <hi>future</hi> been <hi>eternally</hi> naked and open to His <hi>all-searching eye,</hi> it would have been impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that He could have so dispos'd 'em all, that they should have for ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd in their own mutual good and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation, and their <hi>Author's</hi> glory.—It is therefore the natural result of these spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003527_0024_0FF8581A2F608270"/>
in Psal. cxlvii.5. <hi>Great is our Lord, and of great power, His</hi> UNDER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANDING <hi>is infinite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might still continue the thread of <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,</hi> and by necessary deductions from the <hi>works of Creation,</hi> find brightest evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of all other <hi>Divine perfections,</hi> which we have any notion of.</p>
            <p>I might clearly prove, that the <hi>Author</hi> of all <hi>created goodness,</hi> whether <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>moral,</hi> is Himself <hi>infinitely Good</hi>; that the fountain of all <hi>created justice,</hi> is Himself <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely Iust</hi>; that He whose Nature i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> highest <hi>perfection,</hi> cannot be chargable with any <hi>defect</hi> (as all <hi>sin</hi> and immorality is) and must therefore be <hi>infinitely Holy</hi>; and that He who has made, does so carefully preserve and bountifully provide for al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the parts of the World, is Himself <hi>infinite Mercy</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi> But the time would fail me to particularly insist upon these things; and these and the like conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, are so natural and easy from what has been already observ'd, that they don't require to be largely insisted on.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore now hasten to some <hi>practical Inferences</hi> from the <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:003527_0024_0FF8581A2F608270"/>
               <hi>I.</hi> IF there be a <hi>God</hi> of such <hi>infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> it's a natural <hi>Inference,</hi> that He should be <hi>worship'd</hi> in a manner agreable to His <hi>glorious Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS is a <hi>truth</hi> so plainly legible in the <hi>law of Nature,</hi> that the most barbarous <hi>Heathen</hi> and salvage <hi>Pagans</hi> have always assented to it; and it's even impossible for a <hi>rational mind</hi> to refuse an assent. Can we consider Him as the <hi>Author</hi> both of our <hi>essence</hi> and <hi>subsistence,</hi> as the <hi>fountain</hi> of all our <hi>mercies</hi> and <hi>comforts,</hi> upon <hi>whom</hi> we depend, in <hi>whom</hi> we live, and unto <hi>whom</hi> we are beholden for all things; and yet suppose we owe Him no <hi>reverence</hi> or <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage?</hi> Don't even <hi>Nature it self</hi> teach us <hi>to look to the Rock whence we are hewn? A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master; if then He be a Father, where is His honour? If He be a Master, where is His fear?</hi> Mal. i.6.</p>
            <p>BUT to be more particular;</p>
            <p>WE are hereby instructed to manifest our <hi>dependance</hi> upon <hi>God,</hi> by <hi>praying</hi> to Him.</p>
            <p>IF our <hi>life</hi> and <hi>breath</hi> are at His dispose; if all the <hi>good</hi> we want or hope for, is treasur'd up in <hi>Him,</hi> and must flow from <hi>Him</hi>; the very first principles of reason will teach us to repair to <hi>Him</hi> for a <hi>supply</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:003527_0025_0FF8581C696C4F20"/>
of our <hi>wants</hi>; not only because we have no where else to go for any <hi>supplies,</hi> but because it's a rational <hi>acknowledgment</hi> of the <hi>fountain</hi> of our <hi>mercies,</hi> to look to <hi>Him</hi> for all our <hi>good</hi>; and to receive all as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from <hi>His bountiful Hand.</hi> This is an <hi>acknowledgment</hi> that a <hi>Parent</hi> expects from his <hi>Children,</hi> a <hi>Prince</hi> from his <hi>Subjects:</hi> and much more may the <hi>Eternal Majesty</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect it from such <hi>vile warms,</hi> and indigent creatures as we.—We should therefore come to <hi>Him</hi> with a deep impression of our own <hi>nothingness</hi>: For what are such clods of animated <hi>dust,</hi> if compar'd to the <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mense</hi> fountain of all glorious perfections? We should come to <hi>Him,</hi> with a humble sense of our <hi>natural unworthiness.</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides our <hi>moral pollution</hi> (which I may hereafter have occasion to consider) we are but poor <hi>potsherds of the Earth</hi>; but <hi>clay</hi> in the hands of the sovereign <hi>Potter,</hi> and can therefore have no claim of <hi>favour</hi> from Him. We must come to <hi>Him</hi> with a humble <hi>resignation</hi> &amp; <hi>submission</hi> to His <hi>will</hi>: For He is an <hi>Eternal Sovereign</hi>; and we at His absolute and uncontrolable dispose.</p>
            <p>THE ends of this proposed <hi>duty</hi> of <hi>prayer,</hi> are not to give <hi>God</hi> a <hi>new acquaintance</hi> with our circumstances and necessities, or to
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:003527_0025_0FF8581C696C4F20"/>
make any change in His <hi>counsels.</hi> No! there can be nothing hid from the <hi>flaming eye</hi> of His <hi>Omniscience.</hi> And touching His <hi>counsel, He is in one mind, and who can turn Him? And what His Soul desireth, even that He doth.</hi> But we should <hi>pray</hi> to Him, that we may be our <hi>selves</hi> fit <hi>recipients</hi> of His <hi>Mercy:</hi> This being a direct means to keep us <hi>humble,</hi> and to awaken in us a sense of our <hi>indigent,</hi> helpless, depending state: It being likewise a means to keep us <hi>reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious,</hi> to actuate our <hi>love</hi> to <hi>Him,</hi> from whom we implore, and obtain all our <hi>good</hi>; And to encline us to <hi>live to</hi> Him, as we <hi>live from</hi> Him.</p>
            <p>THAT <hi>prayer</hi> has a direct tendency thus to excite, and enliven our <hi>religious contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plations</hi> and <hi>affections,</hi> is self-evident. And it's plainly obvious to every man's <hi>reason,</hi> that he is not qualified for the receipt of <hi>Mercy,</hi> that <hi>forgets</hi> both his <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>own soul</hi>; that regards neither the <hi>bounty</hi> nor the <hi>Benefactor</hi>; and that will no way testify his <hi>dependance</hi> upon <hi>God,</hi> nor his <hi>subjection</hi> to Him. The very <hi>light of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> does therefore preach that <hi>doctrine,</hi> Psal. xcv.6, 7. <hi>O! come let us worship and bow down, let us kneel before the Lord our Maker. For He is our God, and we are the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:003527_0026_0FF8581ED99485E0"/>
people of His pasture, and the sheep of His hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF against this it be <hi>objected,</hi> that the glorious Nature of <hi>God</hi> is so highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted above such poor <hi>worms of the dust</hi> as we, that we are too <hi>inferior</hi> creatures to be the objects of His <hi>care</hi> and <hi>regard:</hi>—This <hi>Insinuation</hi> discovers <hi>thoughts,</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together unworthy of such an <hi>Omniscient, Omnipresent,</hi> and <hi>infinitely Perfect BEING,</hi> who without any <hi>pains</hi> or difficulty, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects and orders every <hi>atom</hi> in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, takes care (as we may plainly see) of every <hi>worm</hi> and <hi>fly,</hi> arrays the <hi>lillies of the field,</hi> with their beautiful cloathing, and provides food even for the <hi>ravens of the valley.</hi>—Were any thing below His notice, whence could it <hi>subsist?</hi> What could uphold it in <hi>being,</hi> or prevent its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to its original <hi>causes?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM what has been said, it further ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that we should not only manifest our <hi>dependance</hi> upon <hi>God</hi> by <hi>praying</hi> to Him, but our <hi>Gratitude</hi> by <hi>Thanksgiving</hi> &amp; <hi>Praise</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>THAT <hi>Gratitude</hi> is a natural debt to a <hi>Benefactor,</hi> and that our <hi>thankfulness</hi> should be proportion'd to the <hi>benefits</hi> received, are truths every where acknowledged. How then should our hearts and mouths be for
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:003527_0026_0FF8581ED99485E0"/>
ever fill'd with <hi>praises</hi> to the <hi>infinite Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> of <hi>goodness</hi>; from whence so many streams of <hi>mercy</hi> are continually flowing to us, and from whom we are continually receiving such a <hi>variety</hi> and <hi>affluence</hi> of what is fit for our use, comfort, support, ornament, and delight!</p>
            <p>BESIDES the wonders of <hi>Redeeming love,</hi> and the <hi>mercies</hi> which refer to another life (which I hope to have a further oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to consider) the <hi>good things</hi> of this World only, which we all enjoy, give us cause to rouse up our <hi>grateful</hi> resentments, in that language, Psal. ciii.1, 2. <hi>Bless the Lord, O my Soul, and all that is within me, bless His holy Name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might further observe under this <hi>head,</hi> that the consideration of the <hi>Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> should make us most serious, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, sincere, and spiritual in all our <hi>religious devotions.</hi> It's most evident, that this <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscient eye</hi> can't be flattered and deceived, with any <hi>formal shews</hi> and superficial pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences: For <hi>He knows our thoughts afar off, searches our hearts and reins</hi>; and has clearest <hi>views</hi> of our most inward motions and retirements of soul: Nor can He be pleased with our <hi>mock-shews</hi> of devotion,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:003527_0027_0FF85820CF6B0968"/>
while we <hi>flatter Him with our lips, and lye to Him with our tongues, and have our hearts far from Him:</hi> No! <hi>God is a Spirit, &amp; they that worship Him, must worship Him in spirit and truth,</hi> Joh. iv.24.</p>

               <hi>II.</hi> THIS <hi>Doctrine</hi> teacheth us the last ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity that we are in, of an interest in the <hi>favour</hi> of this <hi>glorious God.</hi> Horror &amp; sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize accompanies the very thought of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at <hi>odds</hi> with this <hi>dread<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. THE fallen <hi>apostate</hi> state of mankind <hi>Christ died for the UNGODLY, i. e.</hi> for such as were in an estate of distance from God, of enmity and opposition to Him.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Text</hi> indeed gives us no light into the cause of this <hi>guilt</hi> and <hi>wo</hi>; but <hi>reason</hi> as well as <hi>revelation</hi> plainly dictates, that it is inconsistent with the <hi>merciful nature</hi> of our <hi>glorious Creator,</hi> and natural Lord, either to create us in an estate of <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>misery</hi>; or to reduce us to those wretched circumstances without just provocation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And therefore that <hi>rebellion</hi> and <hi>apostacy</hi> must necessarily be the source of this <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi> and <hi>pollution,</hi> as we shall more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly consider.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WE may note the awful consequences of our <hi>apostacy. We were without strength.</hi> The original word here rendred <hi>without strength,</hi> is very emphatical, and represents
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:003527_0028_0FF85823DFEE9F20"/>
us in most <hi>languishing,</hi> helpless, &amp; distressed circumstances. It alludes to and is taken from the <hi>imbecillity</hi> of those that are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the last <hi>extremity,</hi> and brought to the brink of the <hi>grave,</hi> by sore sickness.</p>
            <p n="3">3.

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. WE may note the <hi>seasonableness</hi> of this <hi>remedy</hi> provided for us. <hi>In due TIME Christ died,</hi> &amp;c. which must either refer to the <hi>time pre-ordained</hi> of God for this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious deliverance, as some understand the words; or rather to the <hi>fitness</hi> of the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, wherein our <hi>blessed Redeemer</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took and accomplish'd our <hi>ransom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>misery</hi> of the World at the time of <hi>Christ's appearing,</hi> by their universal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravation of manners, and by the deluge of <hi>Idolatry,</hi> that cover'd the face of the <hi>Earth</hi>; makes it appear to have been a <hi>fit season,</hi> for the glorifying the <hi>Divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passion.</hi> And the <hi>union</hi> of the nations un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

the <hi>imperial</hi> government, made it a <hi>fit season</hi> to publish the <hi>salvation</hi> procur'd for them.</p>
            <p>BUT for a more distinct handling the <hi>words,</hi> I shall consider them as consisting of these two <hi>Propositions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. THAT <hi>mankind</hi> is brought into a <hi>sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> miserable, helpless state.</p>
            <p n="2">II. THAT our <hi>Lord Iesus Christ</hi> did in due time <hi>die</hi> for their <hi>deliverance</hi> out of this state.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>method</hi> I propose to my self, in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing upon these Propositions, is to distinctly shew, that they are not only <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed truths,</hi> but also most consonant and agreable to the <hi>light of reason:</hi> And then as I pass along, make some brief <hi>Reflections</hi> by way of <hi>Improvement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Prop. I. THAT <hi>mankind</hi> is brought into a <hi>sinful</hi> miserable and helpless state.</p>
            <p>THIS may be illustrated, by first offering some <hi>rational evidences</hi> of this awful truth; and then by enquiring into the <hi>cause</hi> or <hi>reason</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>FOR evincing the truth of the <hi>Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> I shall offer these following con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT'S plain to every <hi>intelligent</hi> mind, that a rational creature may <hi>sin against God.</hi>
               <pb n="41" facs="unknown:003527_0029_0FF85826EE7BC3D8"/>
Every one must upon first thought acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that our <hi>glorious Creator</hi> sustains a near relation to us as our common <hi>Parent,</hi> and the <hi>Author</hi> of our <hi>Being,</hi> on which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count He justly claims our <hi>love</hi> and <hi>reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence:</hi> And that He has an absolute <hi>sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty</hi> and <hi>dominion</hi> over us, as our <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>King</hi>; whereby He is entitled to our <hi>subjection</hi> and <hi>obedience.</hi> If then instead of that <hi>love</hi> and <hi>reverence</hi> which we owe to our <hi>Heavenly Father,</hi> we set light by o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> disesteem any of His <hi>infinite Perfections:</hi> Or if instead of that <hi>obedience,</hi> which is due to this <hi>gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rious King,</hi> we do those things which we know to be contrary to His <hi>will</hi>; we violate the first <hi>laws of nature,</hi> and <hi>sin</hi> against <hi>God.</hi> This is a plain case, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of no dispute.</p>
            <p>THE only difficulty before us is, how we shall <hi>know</hi> what is the <hi>Will of God</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us. If there be no <hi>law,</hi> there can be no <hi>transgression</hi>; and if <hi>God</hi> has given us no <hi>manifestation</hi> of His <hi>will,</hi> He can't ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect or require our <hi>obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN answer to this <hi>Objection,</hi> I must not take it for granted, that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are a <hi>Divine revelation</hi>; that is yet to be prov'd. But must consider, whether we cannot by the <hi>light of nature,</hi> discover such <hi>manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:003527_0030_0FF85828BB2C7FA0"/>
of <hi>God's will</hi> and our <hi>duty,</hi> as will render our nonconformity thereto crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and <hi>sinful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND if we do but contemplate the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> of the <hi>Divine nature,</hi> this will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the clearest <hi>light.</hi> For whatever is contrary to any of <hi>them,</hi> must be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing to <hi>God,</hi> and repugnant to His <hi>Will</hi>; His own <hi>Attributes</hi> being what He cannot but <hi>eternally</hi> and <hi>unchangeably love</hi> and <hi>delight</hi> in. To exemplify this, The <hi>light of nature</hi> enjoins the belief of <hi>one God</hi> alone; and thereby teacheth us, that He is the only <hi>Object</hi> of properly <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Religious Worship:</hi> And consequently that it is a violation of the <hi>law of nature</hi> to <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> other <hi>gods</hi>; Or that any <hi>idol</hi> of our imagination should be esteem'd, lov'd, trusted, obey'd, or honour'd as <hi>God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MOREOVER, our own <hi>reason</hi> dictates to us, that <hi>God</hi> is Himself infinite <hi>Rectitude</hi> and <hi>Iustice,</hi> and therefore, that every act of <hi>injustice</hi> whether it respects <hi>God</hi> or <hi>man</hi> as its immediate <hi>object,</hi> is contrary to His <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Will.</hi>—Thus likewise does <hi>God</hi> appear to the eye of <hi>reason,</hi> to be a Being of infinite <hi>Goodness</hi> and <hi>Mercy,</hi> whence it's manifest that an imitation of this <hi>Divine perfection</hi> in beneficence, clemency, love,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:003527_0030_0FF85828BB2C7FA0"/>
and charity is acceptable in His sight; while bitterness, wrath, hatred, cruelty, or any acts of unkindness, are as contrary to His <hi>Will,</hi> as to His <hi>merciful Nature.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BY a particular reflection on these men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd <hi>Attributes,</hi> much of our <hi>duty</hi> towards <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man</hi> might be discover'd. And by a survey of His other <hi>perfections,</hi> we might find further acquaintance with His <hi>will</hi> concerning us; and thereby further evidence, that we are capable of <hi>sinning</hi> against Him. The same thing might be demonstrated by several other <hi>Arguments</hi>; but I think few men in their <hi>right wits</hi> can call this into question.</p>
            <p>WHAT man will teach his <hi>neighbour,</hi> that treachery, fraud and violence are sinless and innocent? What <hi>Parent</hi> will instruct his <hi>eldest son,</hi> that he may <hi>innocently,</hi> if he can secretly, take away his life to possess his estate? What <hi>Prince</hi> will teach his <hi>Subjects,</hi> that they are under no <hi>religious</hi> bond to <hi>obedience</hi>; but may without <hi>sin</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>God,</hi> turn rebels, traytors and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicides?
<q>If <hi>man</hi> be under no duty to <hi>God,</hi> and if nothing be <hi>sin</hi> against Him, what a creature would <hi>man</hi> be, and what a <hi>hell</hi> would <hi>Earth</hi> be!</q>
            </p>
            <p>UPON the whole, it's most evident, that
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:003527_0031_0FF8582AF1182168"/>
there are such things in <hi>nature,</hi> as <hi>vertue</hi> and <hi>vice,</hi> right and wrong; this is what our own <hi>consciences</hi> continually remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, and what <hi>all Nations</hi> have always agreed in. Whence that appears agreable to the very first <hi>dictates</hi> of <hi>reason,</hi> in Gen. iv.7. <hi>If thou doest well, shalt thou not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted? And if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. WE have all a sad experience, that our <hi>first</hi> and <hi>chief</hi> inclinations, are to those ways that are most repugnant unto the <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness</hi> of the <hi>Divine nature</hi>; and to that <hi>recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> that <hi>God</hi> reasonably expects from us.</p>
            <p>AS soon as ever we are capable of <hi>action,</hi> the leading <hi>affections</hi> and <hi>passions</hi> of the mind are manifestly <hi>irregular</hi> and <hi>vicious,</hi> the <hi>appetite exorbitant,</hi> and the whole bent of soul after what is most <hi>opposite</hi> to our <hi>duty</hi> and <hi>happiness:</hi> That if our <hi>tender age</hi> were without <hi>restraint</hi> and government, and a <hi>loose</hi> given to our <hi>natural</hi> inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; we should be worse than the <hi>wild asses colt,</hi> and be authors of destruction to our selves, and one another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> With what <hi>care</hi> and <hi>pains</hi> must our <hi>first</hi> years be cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> With what perpetual instructions and admonitions must the seeds of <hi>vertue</hi> be sown in our minds!

            <p>THOUGH there needs no other <hi>Argument</hi> to give us full assurance of this <hi>sad truth</hi>; yet a particular view of the <hi>faculties,</hi> habits and dispositions of our <hi>Souls,</hi> would give us further evidence, that <hi>our hearts are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful above all things, and desperately wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> as Jer. xvii.9.</p>

and <hi>Omnipresence,</hi> that we dare <hi>sin</hi> in His very <hi>presence,</hi> &amp; act contrary to Him, tho' we know that our actions are <hi>open</hi> before Him.—It's a daring defiance of His <hi>Omnipotence,</hi> for such worms as we to <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose,</hi> as tho' we could make our party good against the <hi>God,</hi> who made the World, and can make us <hi>fewel</hi> to His flaming <hi>vengeance,</hi> at pleasure.</p>
            <p>IT is a vile contempt of His <hi>Holiness</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> in preferring the <hi>pollutions</hi> of our own irregular appetites, before the <hi>rectitude</hi> of His <hi>Nature.</hi> —In a word, it is a contempt of all His <hi>Attributes,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect <hi>enmity</hi> and <hi>rebellion</hi> against Him.</p>
            <p>FROM this contemplation, it's most ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that we wretchedly <hi>deviate</hi> from the great <hi>end</hi> of our <hi>Creation,</hi> both by the habits and acts of <hi>sin.</hi> For it's the height of <hi>stupidity</hi> to imagine, that <hi>Infinite Wisdom</hi> should make so <hi>noble</hi> a Being, for no high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er purposes, than to contemn His <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes,</hi> spurn His <hi>Authority,</hi> and maintain a course of <hi>opposition</hi> to Him. And the same consideration lays open before us the <hi>guilt</hi> of a <hi>sinful</hi> state. For if rebellion and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son against an <hi>earthly Sovereign</hi> be by all men voted so <hi>black</hi> a <hi>crime,</hi> as to involve the <hi>rebel</hi> in deepest <hi>guilt,</hi> and expose him

to sharpest <hi>revenges</hi>; how much more <hi>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal</hi> and <hi>guilty</hi> must he be, that maintains a <hi>rebellion</hi> against the <hi>King of kings,</hi> and lives in a course of open <hi>enmity</hi> &amp; <hi>defiance</hi> both to His <hi>Being</hi> &amp; <hi>Government!</hi> which we have seen to be our case.</p>
            <p>WHAT kind or degrees of <hi>punishment,</hi> an offended <hi>Sovereign</hi> will inflict upon such <hi>rebels,</hi> is not so easily discover'd by the <hi>light of nature.</hi> But that we are justly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to <hi>punishment,</hi> is visible from the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our crimes. None calls in question the equity of <hi>penal</hi> rewards to <hi>traytors</hi> in the <hi>State:</hi> how much less can we reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably expect to escape <hi>unpunish'd</hi> for our <hi>treason</hi> against <hi>Heaven!</hi> If it be <hi>justice</hi> in man to <hi>punish</hi> the delinquent, it must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be so in <hi>God</hi>; who is the <hi>fountain</hi> of all created <hi>justice,</hi> and whose holy <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> is the only pattern of our <hi>vertues</hi> and regular conduct.

They may not, they cannot suppose, that such guilty and polluted creatures, such enemies to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>holiness</hi> should be the objects of the <hi>Divine love</hi> and <hi>complacency</hi>;

or be admitted to the favourable presence, and delightful fruition of a <hi>holy God.</hi> No! <hi>He is of purer eyes than to behold evil, or to look upon sin with approbation.</hi>— Thus we see, that the loss of <hi>God's favour,</hi> and thereby the loss of all <hi>happiness</hi> (which can only consist in His <hi>favour</hi>) is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and necessary result of our state of <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>enmity</hi> to Him. And tho' we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not discover by <hi>natural light,</hi> to what manner or measure of positive <hi>penalties</hi> our <hi>sins</hi> expose us: Yet we have greatest rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to expect and fear some terrible mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festation of <hi>God's</hi> righteous <hi>displeasure.</hi>

            <p>HERE let the <hi>Deist</hi> try his skill: Let him without the assistance of <hi>revelation,</hi> draw up a perfect <hi>system</hi> of the laws of nature: Let him consult the means of restoring our <hi>lost innocency</hi>; and of keeping our <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>passions,</hi> under the government of <hi>religion</hi> and <hi>reason:</hi> Let him call in the help of all the <hi>Philosophers</hi> of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> for his assistance in this arduous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking: And in the conclusion, he'll have but his labour for his pains, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in the same inextricable <hi>labyrinth.</hi>

            <p>THIS is apparent from the fruitless pains of all the wisest <hi>moral heathen</hi> in this case; who, tho' all sensible of our <hi>pravity</hi> and <hi>misery,</hi> could never find out the <hi>cause</hi> nor <hi>cure.</hi> They have indeed, some of 'em, given excellent <hi>moral rules,</hi> for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

and conduct of human life. But then, these were all very defective in many essential <hi>articles</hi>; and their best <hi>systems</hi> have countenanc'd and encourag'd, even the grossest and most unnatural <hi>impieties.</hi> But what light have any, or all of 'em given, in the present enquiry?

            <p>HAVING thus discover'd our <hi>misery,</hi> we may next consider the <hi>cause</hi> of it, under this <hi>enquiry,</hi> —</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:003527_0037_0FF858382D0928D8"/>WHENCE is it so, that mankind is thus brought into a <hi>sinful, miserable,</hi> and <hi>helpless</hi> state?</p>
            <p>To which I answer;</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE could not at <hi>first</hi> come out of the hands of our <hi>holy Creator,</hi> in such a corrupt, polluted, and <hi>sinful</hi> state.</p>
            <p>HAD <hi>God</hi> at first created us in this state of <hi>defilement,</hi> He must have taken pleasure in our <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>pollution</hi>; and where then would have been His <hi>holiness?</hi> Had He at first made us with a <hi>natural necessity</hi> of being <hi>guilty</hi> and <hi>criminal,</hi> He must have been the <hi>Author,</hi> as well as <hi>punisher</hi> of our <hi>guilt</hi>; and where then would have been His <hi>Iustice?</hi> Or had he been the <hi>original</hi> and necessary <hi>cause</hi> of our <hi>misery,</hi> where would have been His <hi>goodness</hi> and <hi>mercy?</hi> Therefore, to suppose <hi>God</hi> to be the <hi>Author</hi> of that <hi>nest</hi> of <hi>sin</hi> and uncleanness, in our wicked hearts; the cause of our vile affections, ungovernable passions, and exorbitant ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites; and the <hi>fountain</hi> of all these <hi>poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son streams</hi>; is to attribute to Him worse than the worst of <hi>human affections.</hi> It is implicitly to say, that He <hi>made</hi> us on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that He might <hi>delight</hi> Himself in our <hi>misery</hi>: Which <hi>shocking blasphemy</hi> must be far from every imagination. Whence it
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:003527_0037_0FF858382D0928D8"/>
appears, that <hi>God made man upright, tho' we have sought out many inventions,</hi> Eccl. vii.29.</p>
            <p>AND hence,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE state that we find our selves in, makes the account of this matter in the <hi>third</hi> of <hi>Genesis</hi> very probable.</p>
            <p>I shall not now concern my self with that <hi>debate,</hi> whether this <hi>story</hi> be <hi>literally,</hi> or <hi>allegorically</hi> to be understood: Be it which it will, it is a natural and rational supposition, that our <hi>first Parents,</hi> through the power of <hi>temptation,</hi> were guilty of <hi>disobedience</hi> against <hi>God</hi>; and thereby both for <hi>themselves</hi> and their <hi>posterity,</hi> lost the <hi>innocence</hi> and happiness of their first state.</p>
            <p>IT appears very likely, from the consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of our present <hi>degeneracy,</hi> that we are the <hi>branches</hi> of a corrupt <hi>stock</hi>; and the offspring of <hi>rebellious parents</hi> And let those that question this account of our <hi>apostacy,</hi> either assign some more probable <hi>cause</hi> of it; or for eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>THOUGH we may meet with some diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, in reconciling the <hi>imputation</hi> of <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Sin,</hi> to the rectoral <hi>holiness</hi> and <hi>justice</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> Yet as much as may serve to our present purpose, and clear up the
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:003527_0038_0FF8583C25629A38"/>
consideration now before us, may be set in a plain and easy <hi>light.</hi> It is not diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to suppose, that <hi>God</hi> should punish an <hi>ungrateful rebel,</hi> with the loss of all his <hi>original excellencies</hi> and perfections, both of <hi>body</hi> and <hi>mind.</hi> And it is a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and familiar supposition, that a <hi>dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate st<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>BESIDES, <hi>God</hi> may justly impute the <hi>sin</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> unto his <hi>progeny,</hi> by way of <hi>at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainder</hi>; as when a <hi>rebel</hi> among men for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits his estate and honours from <hi>himself,</hi> and his <hi>seed,</hi> to his offended <hi>Sovereign.</hi> And this will be a more easy supposal, if we consider these two things, (1) That we were all <hi>seminally</hi> in our first <hi>parents,</hi> and in that sense partakers with 'em in their transgression. And (2) That they acted as our <hi>publick representatives,</hi> and therefore were to <hi>stand</hi> or <hi>fall</hi> for us, as well as themselves: Which being allow'd, the difficulty vanishes. And I see nothing in the nature of the thing, that can make it <hi>incredible,</hi> that God as an absolute <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign</hi> should constitute <hi>Adam</hi> the <hi>moral,</hi> as he was the <hi>natural head</hi> of all his <hi>posterity,</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:003527_0038_0FF8583C25629A38"/>
to represent and act for them all, in what he did. We don't esteem it a <hi>hardship</hi> in our temporal affairs, to be equally obliged by what our <hi>representatives</hi> act in our name and stead, as if they were our own <hi>personal</hi> actions. Nor should we in the present case have thought it unjust, to have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took of the blessed fruits of <hi>Adam's obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,</hi> had he <hi>stood.</hi> What cause then can we have to <hi>complain</hi> of the <hi>imputation</hi> of his <hi>disobedience</hi> in this public character?</p>
            <p>AFTER all, whether we can throughly <hi>reconcile</hi> this matter, to our own ways of thinking or not; we can't find a more probable <hi>reason</hi> of our <hi>lost</hi> miserable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, than that <hi>by one man sin entred into the World, and death by sin,</hi> as in Rom. v.12.</p>
            <p>BUT whatever be the <hi>cause,</hi> we cannot doubt the <hi>malady.</hi> We have too sad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of our <hi>misery,</hi> to call that into question: And since we see the <hi>house on fire,</hi> it does not so much concern us to anxiously enquire by what means the <hi>flame</hi> was <hi>kindled,</hi> as to consult a method to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguish</hi> it.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Improvement</hi> therefore, that I would make of this <hi>Proposition,</hi> is, That it is of infinite importance for us, to consult
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:003527_0039_0FF8583E5540BC20"/>
some way of obtaining a <hi>pardon</hi> of our <hi>sins,</hi> a <hi>sanctification</hi> of our natures, and a <hi>reconciliation</hi> unto <hi>God.</hi> Our present state is not to be continued in. It's a dreadful condition to be <hi>God's enemies, a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</hi> And <hi>whither shall we flee for help?</hi> From what <hi>quarter</hi> shall we look for deliverance from the <hi>miseries</hi> we feel or fear? Will the <hi>pagan religion</hi> afford us relief? We have already heard, that the best <hi>schemes</hi> of their <hi>wisest Sages</hi> have been utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficient to this purpose.</p>
            <p>AND a thinking person will hardly be persuaded, that the <hi>worship</hi> of a <hi>herd</hi> of <hi>vile deities,</hi> with <hi>rites</hi> as <hi>vile</hi> and detestable as the <hi>gods</hi> themselves; should be well pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto that <hi>Eternal Majesty,</hi> who <hi>will not give His Glory unto another; nor His Praise unto graven images.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SHALL we then repair for help unto the <hi>Mahometan religion,</hi> and consult the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in our present distress? Alas, in vain! For no wise man can trust in such a <hi>rhapsody of nonsense</hi> and confusion, and in such a <hi>medly</hi> of inconsistent, and absurd <hi>doctrines</hi> of <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> and <hi>tyranny,</hi> twisted together, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out some better <hi>evidence</hi> of its <hi>Divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> than the bare word of the volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and ambitious <hi>author.</hi>

            <p>WHITHER shall we next go?

            <p>THUS far our search has been vain and fruitless. And must we now <hi>yield</hi> the cause, and sit down in <hi>despair?</hi> By no means!

            <p>THE glorious and eternal SON OF GOD beholding our apostate and perishing state, look'd down with <hi>Divine compassion</hi> upon a miserable World, delug'd in <hi>sin</hi> and <hi>guilt,</hi> and undertook their <hi>ransom.</hi> And that <hi>God</hi> might be <hi>just,</hi> in the pardon and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of sinners, He is become their <hi>Surety</hi>; that so by His bearing the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment due to their <hi>sins,</hi> He might atone of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended <hi>Iustice,</hi> and by His <hi>Sponsorial Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness,</hi> He might purchase for them <hi>glory</hi> and <hi>happiness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT this glorious <hi>Mediator</hi> might be qualified for this great undertaking; He was the <hi>Eternal God,</hi> that so the <hi>dignity</hi> of His person might give sufficient <hi>merit</hi> to
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:003527_0040_0FF85840E3C97FC0"/>
His <hi>obedience.</hi> And He likewise became <hi>man,</hi> like our selves, that so He might be able to suffer the <hi>penalty</hi> due to our sins; and that <hi>satisfaction</hi> might be given to <hi>Iustice,</hi> by the same <hi>nature</hi> that offended. He was moreover both <hi>God</hi> and <hi>man,</hi> that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting both the <hi>parties</hi> at <hi>odds,</hi> He might <hi>mediate</hi> between them.—And since <hi>Death,</hi> in the largest signification of the word, was the just and natural demerit of our <hi>sins,</hi> our almighty <hi>Saviour</hi> has for our <hi>sakes,</hi> and in our <hi>stead,</hi> encountred this <hi>King of terrors,</hi> in his most terrible appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in all his <hi>pomp,</hi> with all his <hi>darts</hi> and <hi>poyson.</hi> Thus hath He <hi>tasted Death for every man</hi>; and <hi>redeem'd us unto God with His own Blood.</hi>

            <p>THE bright display of <hi>infinite Iustice</hi> in our redemption by Christ, makes it also appear worthy of <hi>God.</hi> Were <hi>justice</hi> swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd up of <hi>mercy</hi> (as it must have been, had God sav'd sinners without a satisfaction) we might reject the <hi>doctrine,</hi> as unworthy of an infinitely <hi>just</hi> and <hi>holy God.</hi> But since He has shewn Himself <hi>inexorable</hi> in His demands of <hi>satisfaction,</hi> by requiring the utmost farthing of the <hi>surety,</hi> that was due from the principal <hi>debtor</hi>; and by punishing His own <hi>dear S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>IF it be here <hi>objected,</hi> That it cannot be <hi>just,</hi> to transfer the punishment from the <hi>guilty</hi> to the <hi>innocent:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I answer, That <hi>God</hi> by right of His <hi>su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme jurisdiction,</hi> might relax the law, and transfer the penalty. And tho' <hi>justice</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires full <hi>satisfaction,</hi> He might in abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute <hi>sovereignty,</hi> accept it from a <hi>surety.</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:003527_0042_0FF85846D54B56F8"/>
True indeed, the <hi>Redeemer</hi> as He was the <hi>Lord from Heaven,</hi> was not liable to any constraint or compulsion, to this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. But I see nothing either in the Nature or Law of <hi>God,</hi> that should make it unequal, to accept of full <hi>satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> from <hi>Him,</hi> when voluntarily offer'd.</p>
            <p>I acknowlege, that it would be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>just</hi> among men, to accept of the life of an <hi>innocent</hi> for a <hi>guilty</hi> person, because we have not the disposal of our own <hi>lives.</hi> But this nothing affects the present case, since our Lord had in Himself, <hi>power to lay down His own life, and power to take it up again.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT I must hasten to observe, that</p>
            <p>THE most glorious manifestation of <hi>God's holiness</hi> and <hi>purity</hi> in this work of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> makes it likely to be a <hi>Divine contrivance.</hi> Nothing could give a brighter discovery of <hi>God's</hi> implacable antipathy to <hi>sin,</hi> than the amazing sufferings of His own <hi>dear Son,</hi> when imputatively <hi>guilty.</hi> This discovers <hi>sin</hi> to be a weight that even <hi>infinite mercy</hi> could not bear, in that the blood of His <hi>well-beloved Son</hi> must be the only <hi>sacrifice</hi> to appease His displeasure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it; and that He could without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting, behold the bitter <hi>agonies</hi> of Him, <hi>with whom He was well pleased,</hi> when He
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:003527_0043_0FF85849CC52E840"/>
was <hi>made sin for us.</hi> This shews us, that He is <hi>glorious in Holiness.</hi> Exod. xv.15.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Omnipotence</hi> of <hi>God</hi> does likewise appear in its highest perfection, in this glorious work. <hi>God's</hi> creating the World out of nothing, and His upholding and governing all things <hi>by the word of His power,</hi> are not greater evidences of <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence,</hi> than our Redemption by His <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate Son.</hi> The <hi>incarnation</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> and the <hi>union</hi> of the <hi>Divine</hi> Nature with the <hi>human,</hi> is such a <hi>miracle of power,</hi> as exceeds all finite thoughts, in their highest elevation. And the same <hi>Almighty</hi> Agent is discover'd in our <hi>Lord's</hi> miraculous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> without the help of <hi>man</hi>; in the triumphs of His <hi>cross</hi>; and the victory over all our spiritual enemies, obtain'd by His <hi>death</hi>; as well as by His <hi>resurrection</hi> from the <hi>grave,</hi> and His <hi>ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> into <hi>Heaven.</hi> In a word, the whole transaction of our salvation by <hi>Christ,</hi> is a manifestation of <hi>Omnipotent</hi> grace. But I may but hint at things, and shall only add;</p>
            <p>THE glories of the <hi>Divine Wisdom</hi> do also shine forth with brightest splendor in the work of <hi>Redemption.</hi> The very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of this scheme, was beyond the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:003527_0043_0FF85849CC52E840"/>
of any <hi>finite understanding.</hi> The method (tho' most reasonable and agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) is so <hi>deep</hi> and <hi>mysterious,</hi> that it could not have been the product of <hi>human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi>: Which consideration alone, is enough to convince us of the <hi>Divine</hi> ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the <hi>Christian</hi> institution. The end of this contrivance, <hi>viz.</hi> the exalting <hi>God's</hi> glory, and restoring <hi>man's</hi> happiness, was worthy of <hi>infinite counsel:</hi> And the means of accomplishing this vast design, could be adjusted only by <hi>God</hi> Himself.—<hi>Infinite</hi> the <hi>Wisdom!</hi> Unsearchable the <hi>Counsel!</hi> that took occasion from our <hi>sin,</hi> which was the highest opposition to the <hi>Divine Perfections,</hi> to make all His <hi>Attributes</hi> shine forth with brighter <hi>glory</hi>; hereby not only to bring <hi>infinite Mercy</hi> and <hi>inflexible Iustice</hi> into the sweetest <hi>harmony</hi>; but to manifest both in greatest <hi>lustre,</hi> the one in <hi>punishing</hi> the <hi>sin,</hi> the other in <hi>pardoning</hi> and <hi>saving</hi> the <hi>sinner!</hi> Who but <hi>God</hi> could have found the means for <hi>Mercy and Truth thus to meet together, and Righteousness and Peace to kiss each other?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND we may still with greater admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, adore the miraculous contrivance for the <hi>reconciling God</hi> and <hi>man,</hi> by uniting the infinitely distant <hi>Natures</hi> into one <hi>person</hi>;
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:003527_0044_0FF8584B72A76C28"/>
and thereby ordaining such a <hi>Mediator,</hi> who by partaking of both <hi>Natures,</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested in both <hi>parties</hi>; and so every way fit to reconcile <hi>God</hi> to <hi>man,</hi> and <hi>man</hi> to <hi>God!</hi> But I must not enlarge upon this copious subject, which would take a large <hi>Volume,</hi> to the distinct consideration of it; and a whole <hi>Eternity,</hi> in the just admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. The short glance we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready had of this contemplation, makes it appear, that <hi>God hath herein abounded to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us, in all Wisdom and Prudence,</hi> Eph. i.8.</p>
            <p>THUS I have with all brevity consider'd how the <hi>Christian</hi> revelation is <hi>worthy</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> I am now to observe:</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> THAT it every way answers the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable circumstances of <hi>fallen man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHAT could be more agreable to the perishing circumstances of <hi>guilty</hi> condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>sinners,</hi> than the joyful tidings of <hi>pardon</hi> and <hi>salvation,</hi> of a deliverance from the depth of <hi>wo,</hi> and a title to <hi>joy unspeakable and full of glory</hi>; upon such easy and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable terms? This justly recommends the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> above all others, that ever were or could be contriv'd.</p>
            <p>AND if we take a view of the <hi>tenor</hi> and properties of this <hi>institution,</hi> we shall find
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:003527_0044_0FF8584B72A76C28"/>
it so adapted to the <hi>nature</hi> of <hi>man</hi>; to his various stations and relations in the World; to his <hi>comfort</hi> here and <hi>happiness</hi> hereafter; that as no other <hi>Religion</hi> could ever claim like regards, on these accounts, so this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others, appears to be of <hi>Divine original.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the <hi>Gospel</hi> are all <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>spiritual,</hi> agreable to the ennobled na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and faculties of our <hi>Souls.</hi> The <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> are most <hi>just</hi> and <hi>reasonable,</hi> directly tending to make us <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>happy,</hi> chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and beneficent. The <hi>motives</hi> are most noble and sublime, fit to work upon our <hi>affections</hi> and <hi>passions,</hi> to deter us from <hi>sin,</hi> and enflame our desires after the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> of <hi>holiness.</hi>—Here the vices of pride, worldliness and sensuality; of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justice, fraud, persecution or oppression, fierceness or impatience, are justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd and prohibited; and a <hi>flaming sword</hi> brandish'd before us, to prevent our commission of these and such like <hi>sins.</hi>—Here we are taught self-denial, justice and mercy, brotherly love, unity, peace, and kindness one to another; with the most sweet and endearing <hi>attractives</hi> to such a <hi>blessed</hi> life. —Here we have most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent rules, for order and government in

the World; for the peace and stability of <hi>Kingdoms</hi> and <hi>Commonwealths,</hi> for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straining <hi>ambition</hi> and <hi>tyranny</hi> in the <hi>Prince,</hi> and <hi>rebellion</hi> or <hi>sedition</hi> in the <hi>subject.</hi> —Here we may find choicest <hi>cordials</hi> and supports, under all the <hi>troubles</hi> and <hi>afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> we can conflict with; and even against the <hi>fears</hi> and terrors of <hi>death</hi> it self.—Here we have all <hi>rational pleasure</hi> and sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction indulged us, tho' the <hi>sinful</hi> cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of our corrupt and vitiated appetites, are prohibited, as most <hi>hurtful</hi> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious. —Here may our minds be <hi>spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualized</hi> and exalted to the highest eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they are capable of in <hi>this life,</hi> and yet raised with expectations of higher perfections in the <hi>World to come.</hi>—In a word, the <hi>Gospel-scheme</hi> is every way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective of <hi>human nature,</hi> and calculated for our present and future <hi>happiness</hi>; and is therefore worthy to be esteem'd the <hi>Wisdom of God, and the Power of God,</hi> as 1 Cor. i.18.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus seen some of the strong <hi>probabilities</hi> of the <hi>truth</hi> of <hi>Christianity</hi>; which cannot but reflect a <hi>convincing light,</hi> into the mind of every serious and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial enquirer: I must defer the further demonstration of this truth, till another

opportunity; and conclude my present <hi>Discourse,</hi> with some brief practical <hi>Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p n="1">I. WE have cause with raised <hi>affections</hi> to adore and praise the <hi>infinite mercy</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> for revealing this glorious <hi>salvation</hi> to us in the Gospel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LIFE and Immortality</hi> were purchas'd by the <hi>obedience</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi>; but they are <hi>brought to light by the Gospel.</hi> And it would have been as well for us, to have had no <hi>salvation purchas'd,</hi> as none <hi>reveal'd.</hi> In both cases a thick cloud of <hi>despair</hi> had cover'd our Souls, that we could never have seen through. But now from the distinguishing <hi>Mercy of God, the sun of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness hath arisen upon us</hi>; and <hi>the day spring from on high hath visited us.</hi> The light of life <hi>blazes</hi> into our Souls; and the way to <hi>Heaven</hi> like the <hi>path of the just,</hi> is as a <hi>shining light, that shineth more and more unto the perfect day:</hi> That we are under the most happy advantages possible, to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure an interest in this <hi>Saviour,</hi> and a title to the <hi>glories</hi> that will be <hi>revealed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET us but consider, how great a part of the World are yet groping in thick darkness, have utterly <hi>lost</hi> their way, in
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:003527_0046_0FF8585038973690"/>
the <hi>mists</hi> of <hi>ignorance</hi> and <hi>error</hi>; and <hi>are without God, without Christ, and without hope in the World:</hi> While <hi>the grace of God that bringeth salvation, having appeared to us,</hi> we are even lifted <hi>up to Heaven</hi> by our privileges: And it will surely appear, that this <hi>special favour</hi> calls for <hi>special thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>; and loudly summons all the faculties of our Souls, to be closely engaged in that inquiry, Psal. cxvi.12. <hi>What shall I render to the Lord, for all these benefits towards me?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND if we yet further consider, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy we are of such discriminating <hi>fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,</hi> it will give us cause to reflect upon these <hi>Divine</hi> obligations, with a <hi>rapture</hi> of Soul. Had there been any thing in <hi>us,</hi> that could have been any incentive to this <hi>distinguishing mercy,</hi> 'twould have lessen'd the obligation: But there was nothing in <hi>us,</hi> more than in the darkest regions of the earth, to move <hi>God's</hi> compassion to us; or to excite Him to <hi>make known to us, the riches of the glory of this mystery, among the Gentiles.</hi> Free sovereign <hi>grace</hi> only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the <hi>praise.</hi> And our ingratitude will be of the blackest dye, if these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections don't make <hi>the fire burn</hi> in our breasts; and inspire us with most exalted
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:003527_0046_0FF8585038973690"/>
sentiments, and thankful resentments of such <hi>special</hi> and <hi>signal mercies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. LET us hence be <hi>exhorted,</hi> to make it our sedulous concern, to obtain an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in this <hi>salvation,</hi> in such a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way provided for us, and so <hi>freely</hi> tendred to us.</p>
            <p>LET us with flaming ardour of soul, and with most undeniable importunity, wrestle with <hi>God</hi> for an interest in Christ by <hi>Faith</hi>; that <hi>He may become of God unto us, Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification, and Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And that we through Him, may be <hi>heirs to an inheritance with the Saints in light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE should be awfully careful, that we don't perish from under the <hi>Gospel,</hi> lest this enhance our <hi>guilt,</hi> and aggravate our future condemnation, that <hi>light is come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, and we chuse darkness rather than light.</hi>

            <p n="1">1.

               </gap> universally receiv'd among the <hi>Iews</hi>

            </p>
            <p>THESE sacred <hi>prophecies</hi> being the <hi>Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of God,</hi> are founded on His <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>faithfulness,</hi> are immutable as <hi>God</hi> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self; and therefore cannot fail of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment.</p>
            <p n="3">3. FOR the clearer understanding the words before us, we may <hi>note</hi> the end and design of our <hi>glorious Lord,</hi> in this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was to confirm and establish the Faith of His <hi>Disciples</hi> in Himself, as the <hi>hope of Israel</hi> and <hi>the Saviour of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS appears from the connection of these words with the foregoing context.—In the 37<hi>th</hi> verse, we find the <hi>Disciples</hi> terrified and affrighted with our <hi>Lord's</hi> miraculous appearance among 'em; <hi>suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing they had seen a spirit.</hi> And we are told in the 41<hi>st verse,</hi> that their surprize not only continued, but was accompanied with incredulity and unbelief. Our <hi>Lord</hi> therefore to obviate both their difficulties, first takes meat and eats before them, to convince 'em that He was not a <hi>spirit</hi>; and then urges the present <hi>Argument,</hi> as sufficient for ever to silence all their doubts
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:003527_0048_0FF85854F8E283E8"/>
and scruples, about the cause of His suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and His Resurrection from the dead. This <hi>Argument</hi> He had before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated upon 'em, and now again leaves with 'em, as a standing confirmation of their Faith, in that <hi>important Article.</hi> The sum of which <hi>Argument</hi> is this, That all the <hi>sacred writings</hi> (which could not fail of accomplishment) did unanimously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict the manner of life, the death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the <hi>Messiah.</hi> And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they could have no room left for sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize or diffidence, with relation to <hi>Him,</hi> in whom they had seen the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all these <hi>prophecies:</hi> This being an attestation from <hi>God</hi> Himself, of His <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Mission.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OR we may more summarily take up the words, in this

            <p>I mean not in this enquiry, to consider the word in its full latitude, nor to take notice of the various acceptations it obtains in <hi>Scripture:</hi> But briefly to shew, in what sense it is to be understood in the present <hi>Argument.</hi> And as it affects the case be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us, I understand a <hi>Prophecy</hi> to be <hi>a Divine prediction of future contingent events.</hi>—I call it a <hi>Divine prediction,</hi> because it's the sole prerogative of <hi>Omniscience,</hi> to foresee future contingencies: And it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not come within the compass of any <hi>finite</hi> understanding, to foretel those things, that have no foundation in nature, nor depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on natural causes.—And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider <hi>contingent events,</hi> as the only object of <hi>prophecy</hi>; because it requires in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, no <hi>prophetic spirit,</hi> to predict those e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents that are in themselves necessary, or that depend upon the nature of things.</p>

               <pb n="81" facs="unknown:003527_0049_0FF8585739410738"/>BUT I need not insist upon this <hi>descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> the case being plain, familiar, and universally agreed in. I proceed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To consider, How a <hi>prophecy</hi> may be said to be <hi>fulfilled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>prophecy</hi> is sometimes said to be <hi>fulfilled,</hi> by way of <hi>accommodation</hi> only: when a prediction of one thing, may by reason of some eminent parity or similitude between them, be aptly <hi>accommodated</hi> to another.</p>
            <p>IN this sense, the word <hi>fulfilled</hi> was in frequent use among the <hi>Iews:</hi> who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting to speak in <hi>Scripture-language,</hi> would frequently mention the <hi>fulfilling</hi> of <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> when they meant no more by it, than a parity or agreement of circumstances, between the case consider'd, and the quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Text; or an example parallel to some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing foretold, or spoken of in <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN this <hi>allegorical</hi> sense, the sacred Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the <hi>New Testament,</hi> do also some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times speak of the <hi>fulfilling</hi> of <hi>prophecy,</hi> where there is no direct or literal <hi>accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plishment,</hi> nothing but an agreement, or accommodation of the event &amp; prediction. Thus our Lord's return from <hi>Egypt</hi> is said
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:003527_0050_0FF85859A655CC08"/>
to be <hi>That it might be fulfilled, that was spoken of the Lord by the Prophet, saying, Out of Egypt have I called my Son,</hi> Mat. ii.15. And thus the destruction of the young children by <hi>Herod,</hi> is said to be a <hi>fulfilling of that which was spoken by Ieremy the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, saying, In Rama was a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and great mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Rachel weeping for her children,</hi> &amp;c. Whereas it is evident, that the first cited words of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> did immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the deliverance of the children of <hi>Israel,</hi> from their <hi>Egyptian bondage,</hi> and the latter to their distress and anguish from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> carnage and captivity.</p>
            <p>FROM this use of the word <hi>Fulfilled,</hi> our modern <hi>Infidels</hi> have, unreasonably enough, taken occasion of insult &amp; triumph; thence insinuating the weakness or unfaithfulness of the <hi>Evangelical Historians.</hi> But a due consideration of the case will discover more of <hi>spleen,</hi> than argument, in these ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religious fleers. Was there any thing more common among the most famous <hi>Greek Orat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>accommodation</hi> of the citation to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter treated of? Or is there any thing more common among our selves, than to cite <hi>Scriptures</hi> in this <hi>allusive</hi> manner, which have no direct or immediate reference to the subject-matter of the Discourse? To exemplify this, It is consonant to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd modes of speaking, to call these un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Gentlemen, <hi>mocking Ishmaelites,</hi> or <hi>insulting Edomites</hi>; although those <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Gen.</hi> xxi.9. and <hi>Psal.</hi> cxxxvii.7. which are <hi>fulfilled</hi> in them, did not origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally and primarily refer to <hi>Hobbs, Blount, Collins,</hi> or of any of their admirers. And I must tell them that continue in their <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity,</hi> after such full and clear evidences of the truth of Christianity, as have been from time to time offer'd 'em; that there is <hi>fulfilled</hi> in them, what was spoken by the <hi>Prophet Ieremy,</hi> chap. v. ver. 21. that they are <hi>a foolish people, and without un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, which have eyes and see not, which have ears and hear not.</hi> Though I don't think the <hi>Prophet</hi> had them in view when he spoke those words.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A <hi>prophecy</hi> is more strictly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>fulfilled,</hi> when a prediction, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to its direct meaning, and primary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign

and intention, meets with an exact and full <hi>accomplishment.</hi> And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. A <hi>prophecy</hi> may be said to be <hi>fulfilled,</hi> when it has a double <hi>accomplishment</hi>; and is completed both in the <hi>Type</hi> and <hi>Anti-type,</hi> in the <hi>Sign,</hi> and the Thing thereby <hi>signified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT has been indeed question'd by very learn'd and judicious men, whether any <hi>prophecies</hi> may in strictness of speech, be said to have such a double reference: They rather suppose, that those <hi>prophecies</hi> that have been so understood, do look unto <hi>Christ,</hi> and Him only: But then it must be acknowledged, that there is a sudden <hi>transition,</hi> from some other person or thing, unto the <hi>Messiah:</hi> And that two different <hi>events</hi> are <hi>predicted,</hi> in the same continu'd <hi>Discourse.</hi> Thus was that <hi>prophecy</hi> in the 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> vii.12, 16. <hi>fulfilled,</hi> both in <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> and in one greater than <hi>Solomon.</hi> The promise to <hi>David</hi> in ver. 12, That <hi>when his days were fulfilled, and he should sleep with his fathers; God would set up his seed after him, that should proceed out of his bowels; and establish his kingdom:</hi> this was literally verified in <hi>Solomon:</hi> But then the promise in the 16 ver. That <hi>his House and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom should be establish'd for ever, and that
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:003527_0051_0FF8588853FC0338"/>
his Throne should be established for ever</hi>; though it might first refer to, could not ultimately terminate in <hi>Solomon</hi>; but pointed to a more stable and durable Reign than his, even to an <hi>everlasting dominion which shall not pass away; and to a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which shall not be destroy'd.</hi> In this sense the <hi>Psalmist</hi> understands this promise, in Psal. lxxxix.36, 37. <hi>His Seed shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for ever, and his Throne as the Sun before me. It shall be establish'd for ever as the Moon, and as a faithful witness in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> And agreably, from this <hi>prophecy,</hi> the tradition universally obtain'd among the <hi>Iews,</hi> that the <hi>Messiah</hi> must be the <hi>Son of David.</hi> Which interpretation we see justified by the event.</p>
            <p>BUT I don't design to insist upon this Head, my present purpose leading me to consider the <hi>accomplishment</hi> of <hi>prophecy,</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the second and strongest sense. In order to which, I proceed to observe;</p>
            <p n="3">III. THAT there were <hi>Prophecies</hi> of our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> which are strictly, literally, and exactly <hi>fulfilled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE time before us will not allow, that I should enter into a distinct consideration of the multiplied <hi>prophecies</hi> of the <hi>Messiah,</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="unknown:003527_0052_0FF812D3D47C2018"/>
every where found in the <hi>Old Testament</hi>; and shew how they are verified in <hi>Christ.</hi> I shall therefore only consider four or five of those, that exactly point out the <hi>time</hi> of our <hi>Lord's</hi> coming, and then just take a cursory view of some of those predictions, that describe the <hi>circumstances</hi> of His ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing.</p>
            <p>I begin with the blessing of dying <hi>Iacob</hi> to his son <hi>Iudah,</hi> Gen. xlix.10. <hi>The Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter shall not depart from Iudah, nor a Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver from between his fe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </note>. But there is not such a joint agreement among In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters, in the meaning of the word SCHEBET or <hi>Scepter.</hi> The modern <hi>Iews,</hi> in despight to <hi>Christ,</hi> do perversly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it a <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d of correction.</hi> But this is to do utmost violence to the whole scope of the <hi>context,</hi> which every way gives <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> the preference above the other <hi>Tribes</hi>;

and does not mark him out for special <hi>correction.</hi> And it equally militates against the <hi>event,</hi> which shews us, that <hi>Iudah</hi> has not drunk so deep of <hi>God's</hi> fierce displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, as the other <hi>Tribes</hi>; whose name and remembrance are long since blotted out from under Heaven. —Besides, it's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that an emblem of <hi>Dominion</hi> and Government is hereby design'd, from the following clause, <hi>nor a Lawgiver from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween His feet:</hi> For, how I pray, does a state of correction, debasement, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, constitute them a <hi>Legislature?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT leaving these <hi>Rabbinical</hi> dreams and dotages; I must take leave to observe, that the generality of Interpreters, have (I think) mistaken the meaning of this word, supposing, from the use of a <hi>Scepter</hi> in our times, that it must imply an ensign of <hi>Royal</hi> or <hi>Imperial power</hi>; and thence understand the <hi>prophecy,</hi> that a <hi>Kingly</hi> do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion should remain in the hands of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> until the coming of <hi>Christ.</hi> But there are such <hi>objections</hi> in the way of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation, that I cannot come into it: Particularly, it seems very inaccurate, to speak of the <hi>Scepter's</hi> departing from him who never had it. <hi>Iudah</hi> at this time had no <hi>Kingly power,</hi> and therefore could not
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:003527_0053_0FF812D6F295D058"/>
lose it. And the <hi>Kingdom</hi> was so far from continuing in that <hi>Tribe,</hi> from the time of the <hi>prophecy,</hi> until the coming of <hi>Christ</hi>; that there was no <hi>Royal</hi> authority in any of the <hi>Tribe,</hi> for much the greatest part of the time: It commenc'd in <hi>David,</hi> and ended in <hi>Zedekiah.</hi> It not only ceas'd, but perish'd at the <hi>Babylonish captivity.</hi> For though there was a <hi>regal</hi> authority, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> exercised by the <hi>Maccabees</hi> and <hi>Herod</hi>; yet the former were of the <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Levi,</hi> and the latter was an <hi>Idumean,</hi> and none of 'em of <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah's</hi> posterity.</p>
            <p>I therefore chuse with Mr. <hi>Mede,</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the word SCEPTER to signify,
<q>not <hi>Kingly</hi> dominion only; but any power or Majesty of government, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what form or name soever; whereof a <hi>Rod</hi> or <hi>Staff</hi> was anciently the ensign. Whence every <hi>Tribe</hi> is called SCHEBET (the word here used) as being united together under one <hi>Staff,</hi> or power of Government. The meaning therefore, is not, that <hi>Iudah</hi> shall never cease from having a <hi>King,</hi> or being a <hi>Kingdom</hi>; but that it should not cease from being a <hi>State,</hi> a Body Politic, or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, having a power of Government
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:003527_0053_0FF812D6F295D058"/>
or Jurisdiction within it self, until <hi>Messiah</hi> come.</q>
Thus Mr. <hi>Mede.</hi> In favour of whose construction of this word SCHEBET or SCEPTER, it is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that the word is not only frequently used for <hi>Tribe,</hi> and particularly applied to every of the <hi>Tribes</hi> of <hi>Israel, Numb.</hi> xiii; thereby not obscurely intimating, that it was such an <hi>Ensign</hi> of Government as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd to each of the <hi>Tribes:</hi> But it's also used in the sense I contend for, in this very <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I can't see that there was any other <hi>Scepter</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to <hi>Iudah</hi> in the 10<hi>th,</hi> than to <hi>Dan</hi> in the 16<hi>th verse</hi> of this <hi>Chapter.</hi> The difference between them consisted not in the formal nature of their Government or Dominion; but in the duration or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of it.

The streets shall be built again and the walls, even in troublous times. And after threescore and two weeks, shall Messiah be cut off; but not for Himself. And the people of the Prince that shall come, shall destroy the City and Sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood; and unto the end of the war, desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are determin'd.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="92" facs="unknown:003527_0055_0FF8585E5FCF3428"/>HERE is a plain <hi>prediction,</hi> that within the space of <hi>Seventy</hi> prophetical <hi>Weeks,</hi> or weeks of years (that is 490 years, as the <hi>Iewish Rabbins</hi> themselves expound it) the great things determin'd upon the <hi>Iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi> people and the holy City, should be accomplish'd, transgression finish'd, recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation made for iniquity, everlasting Righteousness brought in, the vision and <hi>prophecy</hi> seal'd up, and the MOST HOLY anointed. And within <hi>seven weeks</hi> and <hi>sixty two weeks</hi> (that is 483 years) after the going forth of the Commandment to restore and to build <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the <hi>Messiah</hi> should appear, and be cut off; but not for Himself: And that after His death, the <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Sanctuary</hi> should be destroy'd, and the people given up to desolations.

And (3) The <hi>peace</hi> that should be consequent upon the manifestation of the <hi>Prince of Peace.</hi> Now as to the first, none acquainted with Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, is ignorant of the bright <hi>accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of it, by the ravages and devastations made in the World, by <hi>Alexander</hi> and his followers; By the perpetual bloody wars and desolations, continued in the four Kingdoms, that succeeded to, and stood up in the place of the <hi>great horn</hi> of that <hi>rough Goat</hi>; And by the <hi>Romans,</hi> whose conquering sword at last brought 'em all into subjection.— And then, how soon after the end of this <hi>concussion</hi> of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, did the <hi>desire of all Nations</hi> come
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:003527_0056_0FF85861C16116A0"/>
into the <hi>Temple</hi>; and by His sacred pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, make that House more glorious than the former, though it was in every thing else inferior to it! And as to the last of these <hi>predictions,</hi> how exactly was it <hi>fulfilled,</hi> in the peaceable Reign of <hi>Augustus,</hi> wherein all Nations seem'd to have forgot their former fierceness and rage, as well as the use of their Military Armour!</p>
            <p>THUS we are irresistibly constrain'd to acknowledge the <hi>accomplishment</hi> of this <hi>prophecy,</hi> in our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> by His coming at the very time here foretold, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the <hi>shaking of all Nations,</hi> during the continuance of the second <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>; and in that remarkable time of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal <hi>peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A fourth famous <hi>prediction</hi> of the <hi>time</hi> of <hi>our Lord's</hi> Incarnation, is that in Mal. iii. 1. <hi>Behold, I will send my Messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: And the Lord, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to His Temple; even the Messenger of the Covenant, whom ye delight in: Behold, He shall come, saith the Lord of Hosts.</hi> That this <hi>prophecy</hi> did relate to the <hi>Messiah,</hi> is clearly mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest by the Titles and Epithets here given Him, <hi>The Lord whom ye seek, The Messenger
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:003527_0057_0FF85863965E5180"/>
of the Covenant, whom ye delight in.</hi> And that it was <hi>fulfilled</hi> in our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> is equally manifest, by his appearing in the <hi>Temple,</hi> before the destruction of it, sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly after the Messenger, viz. <hi>Iohn Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi> was sent to prepare his way, by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing, preaching repentance, and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people to believe in Him that should come after him. But this is so plain that I need not insist upon it.</p>
            <p>I might here have also urged <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar's</hi> Dream, in Dan. ii.31,—46. as a <hi>prophetical</hi> indication of the <hi>time</hi> of the <hi>Messiah's</hi> appearing. By which is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, that after the expiration of the <hi>Third,</hi> and during the subsisting of the <hi>F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy,</hi> a <hi>stone</hi> should be cut out of the <hi>Mountain</hi> without hands, that should break the <hi>Fourth</hi> or <hi>Roman Monarchy</hi> to pieces, and become a great <hi>Mountain,</hi> that shall fill the whole Earth; or as the <hi>Prophet</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds it, a <hi>Kingdom that shall never be moved.</hi>—The exact verification of which <hi>prophecy</hi> is too obvious, to escape the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of any observer. None that has but dipt in the <hi>Roman History</hi> can be ignorant, that our <hi>Lord</hi> did appear in the height and glory of that Empire; that after His advent, the <hi>Fourth Monarchy</hi> did gradually
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:003527_0057_0FF85863965E5180"/>
moulder away, until 'twas utterly subvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the inundation of the <hi>Goths</hi> and <hi>Vandals</hi>; and that this <hi>stone,</hi> against all opposition from that <hi>Kingdom of iron,</hi> has grown to a great <hi>Mountain</hi>; and will (as we may surely conclude from this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy) in His own time, fill the whole Earth. But the time before us will not allow me to particularly insist upon these things.</p>
            <p>BEFORE I proceed to the consideration of other <hi>prophecies</hi> of our <hi>Blessed Saviour,</hi> I would here take liberty to observe, that not only the <hi>Iews,</hi> but all the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Nations,</hi> did about the time of <hi>Christ's coming,</hi> entertain raised expectations of some glorious <hi>Monarch,</hi> that should bring great Revolutions upon the World. And from whence should they derive these no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; or whence form these expectations, but from these cited <hi>prophecies?</hi>—If it be alledged, that they might find these <hi>predictions</hi> in the books of the <hi>Sybills,</hi> the supposal adds force to our <hi>Argument:</hi> For if these were really distinct <hi>prophecies,</hi> their <hi>accomplishment</hi> in the Person of our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> is additional evidence to His <hi>Divine Mission.</hi> But if these <hi>Sybilline pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies</hi> were (as they are thought by very
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:003527_0058_0FF85865E456A0A8"/>
learned men to be)
<q>a <hi>Iewish</hi> compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, design'd to propagate the belief of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> and to prepare the way for His reception by the <hi>Gentiles</hi>; and called <hi>Sybilline,</hi> only from a <hi>Hebrew</hi> or <hi>Chaldee</hi> word of the same sound, which signifies <hi>to prophesy</hi>

This convinces us that these <hi>Divine Oracles</hi> under consideration, were understood by the <hi>Iews</hi> before <hi>Christ,</hi> not only to refer to the <hi>Messiah,</hi> but to point out the very <hi>time</hi> of His manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>THAT there were such expectations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Nations,</hi> about the time of our <hi>Lord's</hi> incarnation, is set in a clear light, by many learned Writers, particularly by the Bishop of <hi>Coventry</hi> and <hi>Litchfield,</hi>

of <hi>Antiochus Asiaticus</hi>; but the <hi>Iews</hi> every where lifted up their heads, as if they saw the sign of their Redemption, in the dawnings of the <hi>Fourth Monarchy.</hi> Then rumors went about, no body knew how (tho' indeed originally from the Jews) that nature was in pangs to bring forth a <hi>King</hi> for the <hi>Roman people.</hi> At which the frightned <hi>Senate</hi> decreed the strangling of every child that should be born within that year; But their vain hopes of having that King in their own family, spoiled the execution of the Decree; and so <hi>Augustus</hi> was suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to live.

            <p>To which I may add, that <hi>Iosephus</hi> in a base servile flattery to the Emperour <hi>Vespasian,</hi> applies these <hi>prophecies</hi> to him, and says, <hi>That which chiefly excited the Iews to war, was an ambiguous prophecy found in the sacred Books; that at that time, some one within their country should arise, that should obtain the Empire of the

            <p>BUT it's time I should return to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of some other <hi>prophecies,</hi> that <hi>predict</hi> the <hi>circumstances</hi> and consequents of our <hi>Lord's</hi> appearing.</p>
            <p>IT was foretold, that the <hi>Messiah should be born of a Virgin,</hi> Isai. vii.14. In the <hi>Town of Bethlehem,</hi> Mich. v.2. That he should reside in <hi>Galilee</hi>; and particularly in <hi>Zebulon</hi> and <hi>Naphtali,</hi> Isai. ix.1. That He should enter <hi>Ierusalem upon an Ass, and a colt the fole of an Ass,</hi> Zech. ix.9. That by His miraculous operations, the
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:003527_0059_0FF858683B62CDF8"/>
               <hi>eyes of the blind should be open'd,</hi> and <hi>the ears of the deaf unstopped, the lame restor'd to the use of their limbs, and the dumb to their speech,</hi> as Isai. xxxv.5, 6. That He should appear in low, mean, and afflicted circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances; <hi>be despis'd and rejected of the Iews, be a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief,</hi> Isai. liii.2, 3. That He should finally <hi>be cut off but not for Himself,</hi> Dan. ix.26. And the particular circumstances of His death, with the opprobry and ignominy that attended it, were likewise <hi>foretold</hi> by the <hi>Prophets.</hi> And I need not tell you from the <hi>Evangelical Historians,</hi> how all these circumstances of His life, and death, were exactly <hi>fulfilled</hi> in our <hi>Lord Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND as to the <hi>consequents</hi> of the <hi>Messiah's</hi> coming, it was <hi>prophesied,</hi> that after His death, the <hi>Iewish sacrifices and oblations should cease, their holy City and Sanctuary be destroy'd; and they made desolate,</hi> Dan. ix. 26, 27. That <hi>He should bring forth judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Gentiles, who should come to His light, and see His Righteousness and Glory,</hi> Isai. xlii.1. and lx.3. and lxii.2. Which were so visibly <hi>accomplish'd,</hi> in cutting off the <hi>natural branches of the Olive-tree,</hi> and graffing the <hi>Gentiles</hi> into the same stock; that it must be wilful blindness, not to see it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="102" facs="unknown:003527_0060_0FF8586C315EDEC8"/>I might largely insist upon this subject, and shew you, that there is scarce any passage of the birth, life, sufferings, death, resurrection, ascension, or glory of <hi>our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi>; or scarce any circumstance of the state of His Kingdom here in the World; but what are particularly <hi>prophesied</hi> of in the <hi>Old Testament.</hi> But the time will not allow, nor does the case require, that I should enlarge upon this Head. I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proceed to consider,</p>
            <p n="4">IV. THAT the <hi>accomplishment</hi> of these <hi>prophecies</hi> is a sure evidence, that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is the <hi>Messiah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confess indeed, that the <hi>accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of some single <hi>prophecies</hi> in our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> is not convincing proof, that He was necessarily the Person <hi>predicted,</hi> and pointed out by them. There were (for example) many others, beside <hi>Iesus of Nazareth</hi> in <hi>Iudea,</hi> before the <hi>Scepter departed from Iudah,</hi> who descended from the <hi>Tribe</hi> of <hi>Iudah,</hi> from the loins of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> were born at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> at the same time that the <hi>Messiah</hi> was to be expected, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But then, the united <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment</hi> of all these <hi>Prophecies</hi> in our <hi>Blessed Lord,</hi> renders the evidence clear and incontestable, that the characters of
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:003527_0060_0FF8586C315EDEC8"/>
the <hi>Messiah,</hi> in the <hi>Prophets,</hi> belong'd to Him, and him only. There was none but He, that with any colour could claim the characters of descending from <hi>Abraham,</hi> from <hi>Iudah,</hi> and <hi>David</hi>; of appearing just 483 years after the Decree for build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and restoring <hi>Ierusalem</hi>; of being born of a <hi>Virgin,</hi> in the Town of <hi>Bethlehem</hi>; of working so many <hi>miracles</hi>; of dying and rising again; of setting up a Spiritual Kingdom, whereunto the <hi>Gentiles</hi> should be subjected; And all the many other <hi>prophetic</hi> descriptions of His Person and Government, too many to be here distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enumerated; which all agreed to our <hi>Lord Iesus,</hi> and therefore (as I observ'd) prove Him to be the <hi>Messiah.</hi> This will plainly appear, if we consider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT the <hi>accomplishment</hi> of these <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies</hi> is a clear and certain indication of their Divine original.</p>
            <p>FINITE understandings can have no means of foreknowlege, but either <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural,</hi> from the nature and reason of things; or by <hi>inspiration</hi> from Him, who has all things present and to come in His Omniscient eye. By one of these means therefore all the <hi>events</hi> we have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering, must have been <hi>foretold</hi>; or else
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:003527_0061_0FF8586E34230008"/>
they were all a <hi>juggle</hi> and <hi>imposture.</hi> Mere <hi>conjecture</hi> they could not be; for what resemblance could be found, in all the face of Nature, of an <hi>Incarnate God</hi>; or what even obscurest hints of the time, manner, and consequences of His manifestation? Nor could they have been an <hi>imposture</hi>; for if so, they could not be justified by the event. We see 'em <hi>fulfilled</hi>; and thence are ascertain'd that they were <hi>pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>phetically foretold.</hi> We see that <hi>God</hi> Himself ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleges the <hi>prophecy,</hi> by its completion; which He would not have done, in justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of most audacious and impudent <hi>deceivers.</hi> The consequence therefore irresistibly forces it self upon us, that these were the <hi>Oracles of God.</hi> It is a just chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge, and reasonable Argument, in Isai. xli.22, 23. <hi>Let them bring forth and shew us what shall happen. Let them shew the former things what they be, that we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider them; and know the latter end of them: or declare us things for to come. Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are Gods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know of but one <hi>Objection</hi> that can with any colour be offer'd against this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing; which is, that <hi>Diabolical predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> have often been <hi>fulfilled,</hi> as appears by
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:003527_0061_0FF8586E34230008"/>
the ancient <hi>Oracles</hi> of the Heathen, so frequently consulted; and so frequently verified by the event. In answer to which, I need not insist upon the craft and collusion used in those <hi>Oracles</hi>; or the dark and doubtful meanings, in which they were usually deliver'd, seldom to be understood, but by the issue. But I allow it to be possible (as the <hi>Scripture</hi> also sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses it (<hi>Deut.</hi> xiii.1, 2, 3.) that <hi>God</hi> may, for the trial or punishment of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, let the <hi>Devil</hi> into an acquaintance with some of His future purposes. But then <hi>GOD</hi> is the <hi>Author,</hi> though the <hi>Devil</hi> be the <hi>communicater</hi> of these <hi>prophecies. God</hi> only reveals the event, though an accursed <hi>Balaam</hi> be the Prophet. HE, who adjusts all future things in His own breast, and whose sovereign pleasure and purpose make them possible, can <hi>only</hi> foresee what, how, or when they shall be. To ascribe a foreknowlege of future contingencies to the <hi>Devil,</hi> is to place him in <hi>God's</hi> Throne, and to give him the glory of the <hi>Divine perfections.</hi> But I proceed to consider,</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT it's hence necessary, that all the characters of <hi>Christ</hi> in the <hi>Divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies,</hi> are true, since <hi>God</hi> can neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, nor be deceived.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="unknown:003527_0062_0FF85870091F01B8"/>THE <hi>accomplishment</hi> of these <hi>prophecies</hi> discovers their glorious <hi>Author</hi>; the <hi>Author,</hi> their necessary truth and faithfulness. If they are of <hi>Divine original,</hi> they have a <hi>Divine veracity</hi>; and can no more be charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with falshood, or mistake in any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, than <hi>God</hi> can deny or contradict Himself.</p>
            <p>THUS have we strongest and most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable assurance from the <hi>holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> that our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> whom they have foreseen, and of whom they have so particularly foretold, is the <hi>Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Counsellor, the Mighty God, the Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting Father, the Prince of Peace</hi>; that He is <hi>God's own Son</hi>; and <hi>the Man that is His Fellow</hi>; that He is <hi>Immanuel God with us, the Lord our Righteousness</hi>; and <hi>the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ends of the Earth:</hi> And in a word, that <hi>all things are fulfilled that were written in the Law of Moses, in the Prophets, and in the Psalms concerning Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am aware that <hi>Porphyry's</hi> ancient ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection may be urged against all this, That these <hi>prophecies</hi> were all written since the event; and so are indeed rather histories of what is past, than predictions of things to come. But this is absolutely impossible, the sacred Books having been kept in the
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:003527_0062_0FF85870091F01B8"/>
hands of the bitterest enemies of <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> (the <hi>Iews</hi> I mean) whose malice against <hi>Christ</hi> would not have allow'd 'em (had they been capable) to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spir'd in such a forgery and interpolation.</p>
            <p>CAN it be imagin'd, that they would have devis'd these <hi>prophecies</hi> on purpose to have brought a perpetual infamy upon themselves? Could they thus frame wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons against their <hi>Religion,</hi> and study the confusion of their own faces! —Besides, if they had been willing, they could not have been able thus to have impos'd upon the World. Had it been possible that all the <hi>Iews</hi> in the World, in their most di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant dispersions, shou'd have to a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin'd in this undertaking; had they corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all their <hi>Bibles</hi>; and not left one copy to detect the fraud (which is unreasonable enough to suppose) This blessed Book was in the hands of multitudes beside them; and every where dispers'd among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> especially in the <hi>Greek</hi> transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it; who must also have been in the conspiracy, if any such thing had been done. In a word, the World must have conspir'd in this cursed imposture; and no copy of the <hi>Bible</hi> be left to bewray the villainy; nor any man know how, why, or when it
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:003527_0063_0FF858732FF24EA8"/>
was done. But it's time we proceed to some <hi>Improvement</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> WE hence learn, that as the foregoing <hi>prophecies</hi> of the <hi>Messiah</hi> are by their <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment</hi> in our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> a Testimony from Heaven that He is the <hi>predicted Saviour</hi> of the World; so like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise is the <hi>completion</hi> of His own <hi>predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> an attestation unto and confirmation of His <hi>Heavenly Mission.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Messiah</hi> was foretold to be <hi>a Prophet like unto Moses, whom we should hear in all things,</hi> Deut. xviii.15. And our <hi>blessed Iesus</hi> has justified His claim to that character, by His many <hi>prophecies</hi> of future things, which have been so punctually <hi>verified.</hi> He not only discover'd the most secret thoughts of men's hearts; and foretold the treason of <hi>Iudas,</hi> while confin'd to his own breast, and perhaps before it was conceiv'd in his mind: But also particularly fore-shew'd His own death, with the manner and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of it, the time of His continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in the grave, His resurrection, and glorious ascension. He promised to the <hi>Apostles</hi> and others the <hi>gifts of the Holy Ghost</hi>; with His miraculous powers and operations. He <hi>predicted</hi> the destruction
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:003527_0063_0FF858732FF24EA8"/>
of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and the utter abolition of the <hi>Temple,</hi> with the preludes of that amazing desolation. And I need not be particular in shewing you the exact <hi>accomplishment</hi> of all these <hi>prophecies</hi>; nor have I time to consider the many <hi>prophecies</hi> in the <hi>New Testament,</hi> professedly received from Him, and spoken in His name. I shall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore select one only from among them, the verification whereof is at this time vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to all the World: The <hi>prediction of Antichrist</hi> I mean; the time of whose com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was foretold to be upon the downfall of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> when that could no longer <hi>let,</hi> or restrain his Tyranny, 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> ii.7. The manner of his coming was to be with pride and arrogance, <hi>exalting himself above all that is called God, and worshipped</hi>; and yet under the guise of a <hi>minister of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> sitting in <hi>the Temple of God,</hi> and there strengthning his interest by <hi>all power, and signs, and lying wonders,</hi> 2 Thes. ii.4, 11. The place of his residence was to be in a <hi>great City,</hi> built upon <hi>seven moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains</hi>; that is, in the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> which only answers this description, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii.9, 18. His Reign was to be <hi>tyrannical,</hi> with horrible <hi>persecution of the Saints.</hi> Rev. xiii 7, and elsewhere. Now who can help but

see an exact accomplishment of these, and many other characters of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> in the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Roman papacy</hi>; and thereby a full evidence of our <hi>Saviour's</hi> Omniscience, in foretelling these events?</p>
            <p n="2">

            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Spirit of prophecy,</hi> which every where appears in them, must necessarily be the <hi>Spirit of God</hi>; who only (as we have heard) can be the Author of a true <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Old Testament</hi> has this attestation to its verity and <hi>Divine</hi> original, it being throughout a continued series of <hi>accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plish'd prophecy.</hi> A great part of that blessed Book consists, either of more direct, clear, and express, or more dark and allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive <hi>predictions,</hi> of the <hi>hope of Israel,</hi> and salvation by <hi>Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BESIDES the more explicit <hi>prophecies</hi> of this great salvation, interspersed through almost every book of the <hi>Old Testament</hi>; What were all the typical persons, the typical actions and ordinances; and what the whole <hi>Mosaic</hi> Institution, with the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitical Priesthood, Rites and Ceremonies; and especially their Sacrifices, and bloody Oblations; but <hi>Types</hi> and Shadows of our

               <hi>Blessed Saviour,</hi> to keep alive their Faith, Hope, and Desire of His Salvation, before His coming? There are indeed some Historical parts of this holy <hi>Book,</hi> not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>prophetical:</hi> but these have also their reference unto <hi>Christ,</hi> and not only repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent <hi>God's</hi> care, guidance, and government of His <hi>Church</hi>; but also shew us His faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness in securing the promis'd <hi>Seed,</hi> in the promis'd line; and in preserving the <hi>Tribes</hi> entire, that our Lord's descent might be, as was promised, from the loins of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> the Tribe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS was a great part of the <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> an Index, to point out the Person of <hi>Christ,</hi> with the time, manner, end, and consequences of His manifestation. And the full and bright <hi>accomplishment</hi> of all these things, is not only a verification of the <hi>promises</hi> and <hi>prophecies</hi>; but a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from Heaven, that these <hi>Scriptures were given by inspiration of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I might here also, as a further evidence that the <hi>Old Testament</hi> is indeed the <hi>Word of God,</hi> consider the many other <hi>prophecies</hi> that had no special reference unto <hi>Christ.</hi> Such were the particular <hi>predictions</hi> of the vastly numerous posterity of <hi>Abraham</hi>; of
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:003527_0065_0FF85878226B89E8"/>
the children of <hi>Israel's</hi> sojourning in <hi>Egypt</hi>; of the time of their continuance and state of bondage there; of their deliverance, return to <hi>Canaan,</hi> utter extirpating the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants; and their flourishing circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances during their obedience in that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py land.—Such likewise were the <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions</hi> of the <hi>Ten Tribes</hi> destruction; of the <hi>Babylonish</hi> captivity, with the term of its duration; of the circumstances of the <hi>Iews</hi> after their return, and of their deso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and dispersion, for their rejecting of <hi>Christ.</hi>—And such also were the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous <hi>prophecies</hi> relating to particular Persons, Kingdoms, or Countries; as well as the <hi>prophetical</hi> description of the <hi>Four</hi> successive <hi>Monarchies</hi>; and of the state of the World, during the continuance of each of them, and after the subversion of 'em all. There are, as you all know, innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>accomplish'd prophecies</hi> of this kind, every where in the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> and therein innumerable evidences, that those <hi>holy Books</hi> were the dictates of <hi>God</hi> Himself.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>New Testament</hi> has likewise, from hence, surest confirmation of its Truth and <hi>Divinity</hi>; not only by the multiplied <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies</hi> therein contain'd, many of which are <hi>fulfilled,</hi> and some are yet to be expected;
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:003527_0065_0FF85878226B89E8"/>
but also by the glorious light reflected upon it, by the <hi>predictions</hi> of this New Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <hi>Old Testament.</hi> The <hi>Old Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> has foretold the coming and Kingdom of the <hi>Messiah</hi>; the <hi>New Testament</hi> assures us that He is come, and has erected His spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Kingdom, as was predicted of Him. The <hi>Old Testament</hi> Dispensation consisted of many Types, Shadows, and mystical Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies; the <hi>New Testament</hi> shews us how they were compleated in <hi>Christ,</hi> the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of 'em all. The <hi>Old Testament</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes the time, circumstances, &amp; manner of this new Dispensation; the <hi>New Testament</hi> every way answers the description, as a copy the original, or the face a well drawn picture, in all the parts, features and lineaments.</p>
            <p>THUS we see the <hi>Old Testament</hi> illustra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the <hi>New,</hi> and the <hi>New</hi> confirm'd by the <hi>Old,</hi> and both contriv'd by <hi>Infinite Wisdom.</hi> For, is it possible that any created understanding could devise and foresee so many and various representations of Christ and His Kingdom of Grace, all agreeing with the event, at such a distance from their completion? No surely! this must exceed the foresight of every created in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence. Is it possible that the <hi>Religion</hi> should not be of <hi>God,</hi> which has been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:003527_0066_0FF85879DEE4FF20"/>
and confirmed, by a successive se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>prophecy,</hi> from the very earliest ages of time; and joyfully beheld through the prospective glass of the <hi>promises,</hi> by all the faithful, since man's first apostacy? No certainly! our infidelity would debase us below humanity.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III.</hi> HENCE, from the <hi>accomplishment</hi> of past <hi>prophecies,</hi> we have greatest assurance that those yet future shall be also <hi>fulfilled.</hi> For they have all the same glorious <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor:</hi> all depend upon the same power and veracity.</p>
            <p>FROM hence may we entertain certain expectations of that flourishing state of the <hi>Church,</hi> when <hi>Antichrist shall be destroy'd, by the Spirit of Christ's mouth and the brightness of His coming</hi>; when <hi>the fulness of the Gentiles shall be brought in, and all Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael be saved</hi>; when <hi>Christ shall have the heathen for His inheritance, and the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most parts of the Earth for His possession:</hi> and when <hi>the kingdoms of the Earth shall become the Kingdoms of the Lord, and of His Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM hence may impenitent <hi>Sinners</hi> surely expect a swift approach of their dreadful and eternal wo. They may justly entertain trembling expectations of the

            <p>FROM hence also may <hi>Believers</hi> lay down their heads in the dust with comfort, under a blessed prospect of <hi>Christ's glorious Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, to change their vile bodies, and fashion them like to His glorious Body:</hi> And from a view of that glorious <hi>reward,</hi> which when He comes He will bring with Him.

important truth; and if duly consider'd, cannot fail of yielding us also full and compleat conviction of it.</p>
            <p>FOR the right understanding the <hi>words,</hi> we may <hi>note</hi> in them,</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>declaration</hi> of a matter of fact, that <hi>God did work Miracles, and Wonders, and signs by Iesus of Nazareth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>Apostle</hi> here considers our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> in His <hi>human</hi> nature only, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as He had appear'd to the <hi>Iews,</hi> and was by their wicked hands crucified and slain: And thus consider'd as a <hi>Man,</hi> He could not be the <hi>Author</hi> of these <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous</hi> operations. These were (some of them) effects beyond the capacity, not only of <hi>men,</hi> but of <hi>Angels</hi>; and therefore the necessary products of <hi>Divine</hi> power and energy. Upon which account these <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles,</hi> Wonders, and Signs (words of like signification) are justly here ascrib'd unto the <hi>Deity,</hi> as the sole Efficient; not exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive of <hi>Christ,</hi> as the <hi>second Person</hi> in the <hi>Godhead</hi>; but only as He was <hi>Iesus of Nazareth,</hi> or <hi>the Man Christ Iesus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. WE may note the <hi>end</hi> and <hi>design</hi> of this declaration, <hi>viz.</hi> To convince the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, that our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> was by these <hi>Miracles</hi> approved of <hi>God. [Ye men
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:003527_0068_0FF8588009650780"/>
of Israel, hear these words: Iesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you, by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> &amp;c.] <hi>Peter</hi> here takes the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a vast concourse of people, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd from all quarters, to the feast of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> to preach a <hi>crucified Saviour</hi>; and by irresistible Arguments, to convince them, that <hi>Iesus of Nazareth</hi> was indeed the expected <hi>Messiah.</hi> This he evinces, first, by the <hi>accomplishment</hi> of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> now surprizingly visible to 'em all, in the <hi>gift</hi> of <hi>Tongues,</hi> newly confer'd on the <hi>Apostles</hi> and company: And then, as a concluding Argument, urges the <hi>miracles</hi> of our <hi>Lord,</hi> as a declaration from <hi>God</hi> Himself, of His <hi>heavenly calling</hi>; and as a Testimony from <hi>Heaven,</hi> that the same <hi>Iesus</hi> whom they had crucified, was sent, authorized, and approv'd of <hi>God,</hi> and by Him constituted <hi>both Lord and Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. WE may note an appeal to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors themselves, as <hi>Witnesses</hi> of the Facts alledged, [<hi>As ye your selves also know.</hi>] The Argument was founded upon matters of <hi>Fact</hi>; and was therefore more or less forceable, according to the truth or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood, notoriety or uncertainty of the <hi>Facts</hi> on which it depended. If they were false or uncertain, the conclusion drawn from
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:003527_0068_0FF8588009650780"/>
them must be very precarious; if true and publickly known, it must be most just and necessary. The <hi>Apostle</hi> therefore concludes the Argument with these <hi>words</hi>; thereby intimating, that it must needs be of irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistible force to them, who were themselves <hi>spectators</hi> of these <hi>Miracles.</hi> But we may more particularly consider the Argument, in speaking to this
<hi>DOCTRINE,</hi> That the <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by our Lord <hi>Jesus Christ,</hi> are a full and clear evidence, that He was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of GOD, and had His Mission from Him.</p>
            <p>IN speaking to this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> I propose this method;
<list>
                  <item>I. To consider what a <hi>Miracle</hi> is.</item>
                  <item>II. To prove, that there were real <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> wrought by our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>III. To make it appear, that these <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles</hi> are full and clear evidence of <hi>Christ's Divine Mission,</hi> and that He was the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised <hi>Messiah.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. THEN I'm to consider what a <hi>Miracle</hi> is.</p>
            <p>AND for explaining the nature of a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle,</hi> in the common <hi>Theological</hi> sense of the word, I may observe to you, that a
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:003527_0069_0FF85881E0C02BA8"/>
               <hi>Miracle</hi> has been ordinarily described, <hi>An extraordinary operation of God in nature, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther stopping its course, or producing some effects, that are above its laws and power.</hi> And it has been the received Doctrine of <hi>Divines,</hi> that the working of <hi>Miracles</hi> is the sole prerogative of <hi>God</hi> Himself. But some very learned men, who have lately written upon this subject, have justly found fault with this <hi>Description</hi>; and made it evident, that a true <hi>miracle</hi> may be wrought by the instrumentality of <hi>Angels.</hi> They therefore chuse thus to define a <hi>Miracle, A work effected in a manner UNUSUAL, or different from the common and regular me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Providence, by the interposition either of God Himself, or of some intelligent Agent superior to man; for the proof or evidence of some particular Doctrine, or in attestation to the Authority of some particular person.</hi> But how just soever this <hi>description</hi> may be of <hi>Miracles</hi> in general; yet there were certainly such <hi>miraculous works</hi> perform'd by our <hi>Blessed Lord,</hi> as exceeded the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of all the <hi>Angels</hi> of light; and it is upon such operations only, that I shall put the stress of the present Argument: And shall therefore in illustrating the truth before us, consider <hi>Miracles</hi> as <hi>extraordinary,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:003527_0069_0FF85881E0C02BA8"/>
and immediate operations of God, in produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing effects, either contrary to, or different from the common course of Nature and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence.</hi> I call them <hi>extraordinary and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate operations of God,</hi> exclusive of all finite power: For allowing that <hi>Angels</hi> may be able to work some true <hi>Miracles</hi>; yet there are many of those operations, whereof we are now to treat, that are as much the peculiar prerogative of <hi>God</hi> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as the creation of the World; as we shall see more particularly hereafter.—I describe <hi>Miracles</hi> to be <hi>effects contrary to, or different from the common course of Nature and Providence:</hi> For though the power of God is as much discover'd in the ordinary works of Nature and Providence, as in those effects that are most contrary to, or different from their common course: Yet those only that are <hi>extraordinary,</hi> are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>miraculous</hi>; as they are evidences, that <hi>God</hi> suspends the common motions of nature, for some uncommon or extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary purpose.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I am to prove, that there were real <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought by our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS may be fully confirm'd by the following considerations:</p>

                   facs="unknown:003527_0070_0FF8588440B92670"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>1. THE sacred Writers report, that many such <hi>Miracles</hi> were wrought by our <hi>Blessed Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT would take up more than all the time before us, to particularly consider all these demonstrations of His <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> recorded in the <hi>Scriptures</hi>; and yet their number doubtless far exceeded the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account of them: But were they more or fewer, if such as were the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary productions of <hi>Omnip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tence,</hi> they will sufficiently serve the present purpose, and prove the point under consideration. I shall therefore select some few (and I need mention but a few) of those indispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table instances of the <hi>miraculous</hi> works perform'd by our Lord Jesus, both before His death, and after His resurrection; and recorded in the <hi>sacred Writings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE read <hi>Ioh.</hi> ii. begin. of our Lord's honouring a wedding with His presence; and manifesting the glory of His <hi>Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,</hi> by turning <hi>water</hi> into <hi>wine</hi> better than the natural blood of the grape. Now though it be possible, that created <hi>spirits</hi> might invisibly remove the <hi>water,</hi> and substitute <hi>wine</hi> in the place of it; yet the <hi>Historian</hi> plainly intimates, that this was immediately done by our <hi>Lord's</hi> powerful
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:003527_0070_0FF8588440B92670"/>
Word; and that it therefore was what no less than a <hi>Creating Power</hi> could possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly effect.</p>
            <p>A like instance was His feeding <hi>five thousand men, beside women and children, with five loaves and two fishes:</hi> And <hi>four thousand men, beside women and children, with seven loaves and a few little fishes:</hi> And causing the bread to increase by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eaten, and the fragments to exceed the quantity of the loaves, at first set be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the multitudes, <hi>Matth.</hi> xiv.19. and <hi>Chap.</hi> xv.34. Tho' in this case it may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise be easily supposed, that an <hi>Angel</hi> might invisibly bring a fresh supply of bread and fish, in the place of what was eaten; yet the sacred story represents it as <hi>Christ's</hi> own immediate work, and therefore as a clear manifestation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> His <hi>omnipotent power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AN equal evidence of His immediate and <hi>omnipotent</hi> agency, was His forcing the Elements to acknowlege their <hi>Sovereign Lord</hi>; and the Wind and Sea to forget their tempestuous ruffle, and to become calm and quiet at His Word, <hi>Mark</hi> iv.39. Tho' it may be possible for created <hi>Angels</hi> to <hi>raise</hi> or <hi>lay</hi> storms; yet this must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily be a work of time: and I can as
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:003527_0071_0FF812D1B1897138"/>
easily conceive them capable of doing E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERY THING, as of quieting the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Air and Sea, without the intervention of time or means; and of making them <hi>instantaneously</hi> obedient to their command: As was the case before us, as appears from <hi>ver.</hi> 37. where we find the ship fill'd with water, and ready to sink, by the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuosity of the storm; and they yet rescued from the brink of destruction, by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate calm.</p>
            <p>I might add to this, His curing so many <hi>diseases,</hi> in their own nature desperate, without any visible means, but His own powerful word. And the multiplied in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of His casting out <hi>Devils</hi>; and even forcing the <hi>unclean spirits</hi> themselves to acknowledge and proclaim Him <hi>the Son of God,</hi> as <hi>Matth.</hi> viii.29.</p>
            <p>BUT if any shall except against all these instances, as what might (for ought we know) be the agency of <hi>created Spirits:</hi> There are others yet to be consider'd, that did certainly exceed the utmost stretch of <hi>angelic</hi> power. Such were His giving <hi>life</hi> unto the <hi>dead,</hi> and commanding their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted Souls into their bodies, by the same powerful word, by which they at first had their being. Thus he raised <hi>Ia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

daughter to life, to the just astonishment of the spectators, <hi>Mark</hi> v.41. Thus he stops the mourning train, that were carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the widow of <hi>Nain's</hi> son to the grave, and delivers him alive to his sorrowful Mother, <hi>Luk.</hi> vii.14, 15. And thus He speaks life into <hi>Lazarus,</hi> that had been four days dead, and was now corrupting in his grave, <hi>Ioh.</hi> xi.43, 44. I might here also add the testimony born to His <hi>heavenly Mission,</hi> by the <hi>resurrection</hi> of many at the time of His crucifixion, <hi>Matth.</hi> xxvii.52, 53. Though it be not expresly told us, that these were raised by His power; yet their <hi>resurrection</hi> was plainly done in honour to His <hi>sacred character,</hi> and an express declaration from <hi>Heaven,</hi> that He was verily the <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

            </p>
            <p>BUT the greatest <hi>Miracle</hi> of all was His own <hi>Resurrection</hi> from the grave, which he assures us was perform'd by His <hi>own power,</hi> Joh. x.18. Which (if true) gives brightest evidence of His <hi>Omnipotence</hi>; and that it was true is certain, in that <hi>God</hi> would never have justified a false preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and impostor, by raising him from the dead: We have therefore a plain decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from <hi>God</hi> Himself, that <hi>Iesus Christ
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:003527_0072_0FF85889EE15AF08"/>
our Lord is the Son of God, with power, by His Resurrection from the dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UPON the whole, it appears plain to me, that all the <hi>Angels in Heaven,</hi> or <hi>Devils in Hell,</hi> could not break the bars of the pit asunder, summon the dead from their graves, and cause 'em to reassume life and action. This must be the work of Him only, who holds the <hi>keys</hi> of life and death in His hands.</p>
            <p>BUT after all, were it admitted, that all these mentioned <hi>Miracles</hi> might be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by the interposition of <hi>Angels</hi>; they are nevertheless <hi>God's seal,</hi> to justify <hi>Christ's</hi> Person, and render his <hi>Commission</hi> au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic. They were at least <hi>Extraordinary</hi> works of Providence, wrought in justifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our <hi>Lord's Person</hi> and Doctrine; and therefore a Testimony from Him, who either mediately or immediately governs all the wheels of <hi>Providence,</hi> to that Truth, which they were wrought in confirmation of; as we shall see more particularly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>IT'S true, that if these wonderful works were the agency of <hi>created Spirits,</hi> they would not agree to the Description of <hi>Miracles,</hi> upon which I proposed to found the present Argument. But then, there
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:003527_0072_0FF85889EE15AF08"/>
are multitudes of <hi>miraculous</hi> operations, professedly performed in the Name, and by the Power of our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> that do not, cannot lie open to any cavil or exception; and in which we have all the assurance of <hi>God's</hi> immediate agency, that is possible to be obtain'd in any case whatsoever.</p>
            <p>WHAT I mean are the <hi>Miraculous Gifts of the Holy Ghost,</hi> confer'd not only on the <hi>Apostles</hi> and other Officers in the Church, but upon many (if not upon all) <hi>true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> at the beginning of the Gospel-Dispensation. The excellent Author of <hi>Miscellanea Sacra,</hi> hath handled this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject with such strength and perspicuity, as to give infidelity a fatal wound, and lay it gasping at his feet. What I now propose is to just give you a few hints out of that admirable Author, to convince you, that <hi>God has born witness to Christianity,</hi> not only <hi>with signs and wonders and diverse Miracles</hi> (such as we have already treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of) but also with these <hi>Gifts of the Holy Ghost.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>THESE <hi>gifts</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> were commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated two different ways, either imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by the <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And the <hi>ministring of the Spirit,</hi> Gal. iii.5. And <hi>imparting Spiritual gifts,</hi>
               <pb n="131" facs="unknown:003527_0074_0FF8588E4251E328"/>
Rom. i.11. I shall endeavour briefly to exemplify both these kinds of Inspirations or Illuminations of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> in some few instances.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is said to <hi>fall</hi> or to be <hi>poured out</hi> upon the Disciples, but five times only. The first instance of this <hi>miraculous effusion</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> was upon the <hi>Apostles</hi> and their company. Acts. ii.1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place: And suddenly there came a sound, as of a rushing mighty wind; and it filled all the house where they were sitting; and there appeared unto them cloven Tongues like as of Fire; and sat upon each of them: And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other Tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</hi> This company, upon whom the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> thus miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lously descended, were about an hundred and twenty Men and Women, as appears from <hi>Chap.</hi> i.14, 15, who are here said to be ALL with one accord in one place, when the <hi>Spirit</hi> fell upon them. [From the mixture of Men and Women in this inspired Society, we may remark, as we pass along, the bright accomplishment of <hi>Ioel's prophecy,</hi> that <hi>the Spirit should be
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:003527_0075_0FF8588FF7C5C948"/>
poured out upon the handmaids as well as servants</hi> of the Lord; and that <hi>daughters</hi> as well as <hi>sons, should prophesy.</hi>]</p>
            <p>THE second instance of this kind was a new (and probably a like) <hi>effusion</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> upon the same <hi>Apostles</hi> and company, in answer to their prayer for BOLDNESS and Courage, when they were brought before the Council. Acts iv.31. <hi>And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost; and they spake the Word of God with BOLDNESS.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE third instance was in <hi>Saul,</hi> who (as a qualification for the <hi>Apostleship,</hi> unto which he was design'd) <hi>was FILLED with the Holy Ghost,</hi> Acts ix.17. compar'd with <hi>Chap.</hi> xiii.9.</p>
            <p>A fourth instance was in <hi>Cornelius</hi> and his houshold, who (that there might be no prejudice against admitting the <hi>proselytes of the gate,</hi> into the fellowship of the Gospel) had the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> poured out upon them, <hi>Acts</hi> x.45, and FELL <hi>upon them, as on</hi> the <hi>Apostles</hi> and company <hi>at the beginning,</hi> Chap. xi.15.</p>
            <p>THE fifth and last instance of the <hi>effusion</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> without the imposition
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:003527_0075_0FF8588FF7C5C948"/>
of hands, was on the first harvest of <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Gentiles,</hi> that were converted to the <hi>Christian</hi> Faith; which was at <hi>Antioch</hi> in <hi>Pisidia,</hi> Acts xiii.16. <hi>ad fin.</hi> For it is said of them verse 52, that they were <hi>FIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LED with the Holy Ghost.</hi> And there is no mention of any imposition of hands to that purpose.</p>
            <p>WE are next to consider how the <hi>gifts</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> were received, in a more mediate way, by the laying on of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles</hi> hands. Under which Head I shall only observe, that these <hi>miraculous gifts</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> were confer'd upon very many; and probably upon all <hi>true Believers,</hi> wherever the <hi>Apostles</hi> came. This will appear from these considerations:</p>
            <p>OUR blessed <hi>Saviour</hi> promised this suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess to the <hi>Apostles</hi> Ministry, That <hi>these signs shall f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>llow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out Devils, they shall speak with new Tongues, they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them, they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover,</hi> Mark xvi.17, 18. And the Apostle <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ter</hi> promises the three thousand, <hi>Acts</hi> ii.38, That up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their <hi>Repentance</hi> &amp; <hi>Baptism,</hi> they should receive the <hi>gift of the Holy Ghost.</hi> And he
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:003527_0076_0FF85893EDDE1890"/>
likewise speaks of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> as <hi>given to them (i. e.</hi> to all them) <hi>that obey him,</hi> Acts v.32. Where he could not mean the sanctifying influences, but must intend these <hi>miraculous gifts</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost:</hi> For the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> is here spoken of, as a <hi>witness</hi> of the Resurrection and Exaltation of <hi>Christ,</hi> whereof these <hi>gifts</hi> were an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable evidence (see <hi>Acts</hi> ii.33.) But not the common sanctifying <hi>gifts</hi> of the <hi>Spirit:</hi> these could be no evidence at all of these truths unto others.</p>
            <p>AS soon as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by <hi>Philip,</hi> the Apostles send <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> to them, that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive these <hi>gifts</hi> of the <hi>Spirit: And they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost,</hi> Acts viii.14,—17. When <hi>Paul</hi> came to <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and found certain Disciples there, he asked them (as a questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of course, which he constantly propos'd to all that he did not know) Have ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the <hi>Holy Ghost?</hi> And finding they had not, <hi>he laid his hands on them; and the Holy Ghost came upon them, and they spake with Tongues and prophesied,</hi> Acts xix.1,—6.</p>
            <p>ALL the members of the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> seem to have had these <hi>gifts</hi> in a very plentiful manner. They <hi>spake with Tongues,</hi>
               <pb n="135" facs="unknown:003527_0076_0FF85893EDDE1890"/>
they <hi>prophesied,</hi> they <hi>interpreted,</hi> 1 Cor. xiv. throughout. <hi>EVERY ONE of them had a Psalm, a Doctrine, a Tongue, a Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, an Interpretation,</hi> verse 26. And that these <hi>gifts</hi> were not peculiar to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> but were at least frequent in other <hi>Churches</hi> also, appears from 1 Cor. i.7. where the <hi>Apostle</hi> tells them, that <hi>they came BEHIND in no gift.</hi> And from 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii.12. where he tells them, that they <hi>were not inferior to OTHER CHURCHES,</hi> i. e. in these <hi>signs, wonders, and mighty deeds,</hi> the evidence of his <hi>Apostleship</hi> among 'em, as appears from verse 11. Which plainly shews us that these <hi>gifts</hi> were in the other <hi>Churches</hi> also, tho' not in a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior degree. The same thing appears from most of the other <hi>Epistles</hi> to the <hi>Churches,</hi> as may be seen from <hi>Gal.</hi> iii.2, 5. <hi>Eph.</hi> i.13, 17. 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> i.5. and v.20. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> i.6, 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> vi.4, 5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> i.12. 1 <hi>Ioh.</hi> ii.20. With too many other <hi>Texts,</hi> to the same purpose, to be now distinctly enumerated.</p>
            <p>THESE <hi>gifts</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> whereof I am treating, were sudden <hi>Illuminations</hi> of the mind whereby the recipients were instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneously endued, with the knowlege of a vast variety of languages, <hi>Acts</hi> ii. begin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

and <hi>Chap.</hi> x.46. With a large extensive knowlege of all needful Doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>es of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, whereby they were able to teach the mind of <hi>God</hi> clearly, and powerfully, <hi>Rom.</hi> ii.10, 11, 12. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> i.11, 12. With the Gift of <hi>Prophecy,</hi> whereby they could foretel future events, <hi>Acts</hi> xi.28. and <hi>Chap.</hi> xx.23. And could discern the <hi>spirits</hi> of others, and tell the secrets of their hearts, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiv.24, 25, 32. And also judge of the fitness of persons for peculiar service in the Church, <hi>Acts</hi> xiii.1, 2. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> i.18. They were frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spired with new <hi>Revelations,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiv.30. With the Gift of <hi>Interpreting,</hi> as well as <hi>speaking</hi> foreign Languages, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiv.27. With courage and fluency of speech upon all occasions, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> i.5. To all which, and many other <hi>Gifts</hi> that might be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, I may add, that some of these had the <hi>gifts</hi> of <hi>working Miracles,</hi> and of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diseases, as appears from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii.29, 30. And all the <hi>Apostles</hi> were instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental by laying on of their hands, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part these <hi>gifts</hi> to others, wherever they themselves came.—A more summary exemplification of these several <hi>Gifts,</hi> may be found in 1 Cor. xii.8, 9, 10. <hi>For to one is given by the Spirit, the Word of Wisdom; to
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:003527_0077_0FF85895CCDF1AE0"/>
another, the Word of Knowlege by the same Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; to another, Faith by the same Spirit; to another, the gifts of Healing by the same Spirit; to another, the working of Miracles; to another, Prophecy; to another, Discerning of spirits; to another, divers kinds of Tongues; to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Interpretation of Tongues.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THOUGH these <hi>gifts</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> are sometimes in Scripture distinguished from MIRACLES, particularly in <hi>Heb.</hi> ii.4. yet as they are elsewhere expresly so denominated (see <hi>Gal.</hi> iii.5. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii.29.) so were they certainly in their own nature, <hi>Miracles</hi> of the highest kind, such as could not have been wrought by the united power and skill of all <hi>created Spirits:</hi> For though we know not what power <hi>Angels</hi> may have; yet we may cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know, that it is the peculiar prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of the <hi>Father of Spirits,</hi> so to enlarge the faculties of the Soul of Man, as to communicate those degrees of knowlege in an instant, which probably the most capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious mind could not contain, without these <hi>Divine Inspirations</hi>; and which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the most sagacious of human beings could not obtain in an ordinary way, without spending his whole life in the closest application to those studies. No
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:003527_0078_0FF85897AEA0E7A8"/>
man living can conceive how so many <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Divine Sciences</hi> could be at once imparted to them, by any but Him, who is the <hi>Author</hi> of our Souls, and can enlarge their faculties as He pleases.</p>
            <p>To exemplify this in two of these <hi>Gifts,</hi> which seem to have been common to most of the first <hi>Believers</hi>; the <hi>Gift of Tongues,</hi> and of <hi>Prophecy.</hi> Was it possible for unlearned Men and Women, to instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneously possess such a vast variety of languages, in such perfection, as to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to use them with readiness and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, upon all proper occasions; without having their minds enlarged, and this knowlege communicated to 'em, by an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Agent?</hi> Was it possible that any but He, who only foreknows all future e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, could inspire these Disciples with a <hi>spirit of prophecy,</hi> whereby they could fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel things to come? Or that any but He who knows the mind of the Spirit, and searches the heart and reins, could enable these to <hi>discern the Spirits,</hi> and know the secret thoughts of other mens hearts? No surely! we may as well attribute all the incommunicable <hi>Perfections of God</hi> to a created being, as these <hi>miraculous gifts</hi> and operations.</p>

            <p>THE <hi>Doctrines</hi> they taught, shew the innocence and divine excellencies of their <hi>Faith.</hi> The unexampled pains and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues they underwent to propagate these Doctrines, shew 'em sincere and in earnest in their profession; and make it evident, that they themselves both believed and practised what they taught to others: And the most spiteful and malicious of their enemies never did, and therefore we may be sure never could charge them with any impiety and immorality of life.</p>
            <p>THAT they were eminent for their <hi>sanctity,</hi> as well as other extraordinary en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, appears from their <hi>success.</hi> What irresistible <hi>charm</hi> so suddenly conquer'd
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:003527_0079_0FF8589B02369AC8"/>
the mighty opposition, and insuperable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stacles, in the hearts and lives of men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Gospel?

The despi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>Doctrine of the Cross</hi> had no such charms in it, in the eye of carnal reason, as to produce such wonderful effects. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letter'd <hi>Fishermen,</hi> by whose instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality this amazing change was wrought, had no advantage of <hi>military Power,</hi> or of <hi>learned Art</hi> and Eloquence, to force 'em to submission. These things therefore loudly proclaim the innocency and sanctity of their lives, without which they could not have been regarded. Nay more than so, these things clearly evidence that the <hi>Apostles</hi> and other <hi>Disciples,</hi> had them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>miraculous Gifts</hi>; and did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm their Doctrine by <hi>miraculous</hi> opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; without which Seal of Heaven '<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

pleasures, their comfort, ease and safety, for a persecuted Religion, and a <hi>Crucified Saviour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS we see that the <hi>Witnesses</hi> were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove reproach. And if we always allow for truth, what is confirm'd by a number of faithful <hi>Witnesses,</hi> we may well depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the joint Testimony of such a number, who could all truly appeal to the World, that they had <hi>renounc'd the hidden things of dishonesty, not walking in craftiness; nor handling the Word of God deceitfully; but by manifestation of the truth, had commended themselves to every man's conscience, in the sight of God,</hi> as 2 Cor. iv.2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THESE <hi>miraculous works</hi> and <hi>spiritual gifts</hi> reported by the <hi>sacred Writers,</hi> were matters of <hi>fact,</hi> in which it was <hi>impossible that they themselves could be deceiv'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OUR Lord's <hi>Miracles</hi> were not matters of speculation or science, wherein the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings of the <hi>Disciples</hi> might be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd upon: but matters of <hi>fact,</hi> that came under the immediate cognizance of their senses; such as they could see, hear, and feel; and be ascertain'd of, by all possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means of certainty.—They were not <hi>dark</hi> and obscure performances; they were not done in a corner: but most visibly, in
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:003527_0080_0FF8589CB89EA8D0"/>
the open light, and view of the World; so that there could be no possible oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of <hi>Legerdemain,</hi> juggle or deceit. —They were not only some <hi>few</hi> and doubtful, but <hi>multitudes</hi> of unquestionable <hi>Miracles,</hi> repeated again and again, in view of the same persons, who daily wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their Master, and saw His wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Works.— Nor were these things done before some few ignorant, and brain-sick persons; but in the face of the World, before multitudes of all sorts (beside the twelve <hi>Apostles,</hi> seventy <hi>Disciples,</hi> and many others that followed our <hi>Lord</hi>) who all acknowledged the <hi>facts</hi>; though they were not all converted by them.—And to sum up all, these same <hi>Witnesses</hi> assure us, that they and many others beside them, had themselves the <hi>miraculous gifts</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>; and were employ'd in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the same or like <hi>Miracles,</hi> in <hi>Christ's name,</hi> and by His Power and Authority.</p>
            <p>AND now, will it not out-do the utmost strength of imagination, to find out the means by which these <hi>Witnesses</hi> could be deceiv'd? Is it possible for any man to be more certain that he ever saw the sun, than these could be that they saw the sick healed, the dead raised, their <hi>Lord</hi> expiring
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:003527_0080_0FF8589CB89EA8D0"/>
upon the cross, restored again to life, eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drinking and conversing familiarly with them forty days together, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending up to <hi>Heaven</hi> before their eyes? Is it possible to have greater assurance of any thing we do, or can do, than these could have, that they themselves, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes beside them, had the <hi>gifts</hi> of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, Prophecy, and other <hi>Miraculous</hi> Powers; and did perform many <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi> in the Name of <hi>Christ?</hi> The <hi>Apostles</hi> therefore justly refer to these means of knowlege, as sure evidences, that they could not be deceiv'd in the <hi>Doctrines</hi> they taught. 2 Pet. ii.16. <hi>For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Iesus Christ: but were EYE-WITNESSES of His Majesty.</hi> And 1 Joh. i.1. <hi>That which —we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon; and our hands have hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of the Word of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. As these <hi>Witnesses</hi> were uncapable to be deceiv'd themselves, in the <hi>facts</hi> reported by them, so were <hi>they without any possible temptation to deceive others,</hi> by obtruding falshoods of this kind upon the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="unknown:003527_0081_0FF858A06EB28F30"/>THE common springs of great actions lay altogether out of their way; and could be no motive to 'em, to impose upon man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in this matter.—They could not hope for <hi>honour</hi> or <hi>worldly grandeur,</hi> by appearing in the head of a despised <hi>Party</hi>; and by being of a <hi>Sect every where spoken against.</hi> They could not make their court to <hi>Princes</hi> and the great men of the World, by a <hi>Religion,</hi> which they all oppos'd and persecuted. They could not ingratiate themselves with the <hi>Iews,</hi> nor gain esteem and applause from them, by subverting their darling constitution, and charging the guilt of most precious <hi>innocent Blood</hi> upon 'em. They could not expect <hi>honour</hi> and reputation from the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning their manners, decrying their <hi>Religion,</hi> and vilifying their <hi>gods.</hi> No! they had nothing to expect from their <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Cross,</hi> but to be (like their Master) <hi>despised and rejected of men,</hi> and every where loaded with contumely and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, stripes and imprisonment. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was what their <hi>Lord</hi> had foretold 'em; and in just expectation hereof they undertook His service.</p>
            <p>AND now let us see whether <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Wealth</hi> could be their incentive, to publish
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:003527_0081_0FF858A06EB28F30"/>
these <hi>Miracles,</hi> and preach a <hi>crucified Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi> So far from it, that poverty and penury, distressing indigency and want of all things, were the necessary consequences of their extreamly difficult and perillous travels through the World (to preach this <hi>Doctrine</hi>) where they had nothing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon for sustentation; but that <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence</hi> which <hi>giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens when they cry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OR could a view to <hi>worldly Ease</hi> and <hi>Pleasure</hi> animate them to their undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Could these be expected, by for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking their country and kindred, by tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling from <hi>Nation</hi> to <hi>Nation,</hi> both by Sea and Land, and running upon the pikes of all difficulty and danger? Did they not know before-hand, as well as find by experience, that they should be <hi>hated of all men for Christ's Name sake</hi>; and that <hi>in every city bonds and afflictions did abide them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>UPON the whole then, when we can find men in love with misery and ruin, when we can see Men court poverty and hugg contempt, fetters and bonds; and prefer both a miserable life and death, to riches and honour, liberty and ease, then may we imagine that the <hi>Apostles</hi>
               <pb n="146" facs="unknown:003527_0082_0FF858A2845A5588"/>
had some forcible motive to impose <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries</hi> and <hi>lies</hi> upon us, in the case before us.</p>
            <p>BUT what sets this matter in the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est light is, that they sealed this <hi>Testimony</hi> with their <hi>Blood.</hi> Though it be possible that men may be <hi>Martyrs</hi> for a <hi>false Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>; yet it must be when they think the Religion <hi>true,</hi> for which they die, and so are equally acted by the dictates of <hi>Conscience,</hi> in their sufferings, as if it was indeed the cause of <hi>God.</hi> But now there were multitudes, who parted with their lives in confirmation of the <hi>Christian Religion,</hi> that were themselves the coiners and forgers of the Doctrine, if it was an <hi>imposture.</hi> They could not themselves be <hi>deceived</hi> (as I have already prov'd) and therefore their report must necessarily be <hi>true:</hi> Or else they must be charged with sacrificing their lives to confirm a <hi>lie</hi> of their <hi>own inventing</hi>; and a <hi>lie</hi> which the most exquisite <hi>torments</hi> could never cause any <hi>one</hi> of 'em to <hi>retract,</hi> or repent of. In a word, they must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to part with all temporal comfort, with all worldly satisfactions, and even with <hi>life</hi> it self; nay and even to destroy both body and soul <hi>for ever,</hi> without any manner of <hi>reason</hi> or <hi>motive.</hi> And I'm sure this is what every body must allow,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:003527_0082_0FF858A2845A5588"/>
to be so repugnant to humane nature, as to be altogether <hi>impossible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS we have seen the strongest <hi>evidence</hi> of these <hi>truths,</hi> that any <hi>Facts</hi> in the World were ever capable of: And have thereby stripp'd <hi>infidelity</hi> of all its armour, and found just satisfaction, that the <hi>Apostles</hi> and other promulgators of the <hi>Gospel</hi> have <hi>approv'd themselves the Ministers of God, in their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, in their afflictions, necessities, distresses, stripes, imprisonments, tumults, labours, watchings, and fastings,</hi> 2 Cor. vi.4, 5.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE reported Miracles were matters of Fact, in which it was <hi>impossible</hi> that these Historians could <hi>deceive</hi> the World <hi>at the time when their Narratives were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET us first consider this case, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to the <hi>Miracles</hi> perform'd by our <hi>Lord,</hi> while tabernacling in the flesh. These (as we observ'd before) are said to be done most <hi>publickly</hi> and openly, in the eye of the World, before the most ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant and implacable <hi>enemies</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> who by all their vigilance and subtilty could not detect any deceit or imposture; nor did they charge the <hi>Sacred Story</hi> with falshood or forgery. The <hi>Narratives</hi> were written in the place where the <hi>Facts</hi> were
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:003527_0083_0FF858A5DE743BF0"/>
said to be done, immediately after the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of those wonderful transactions, when they were fresh in every bodies me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; and when no body could be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of their truth or falshood. Had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these <hi>Histories</hi> been false, they must have been so far from gaining repute, and making Proselytes, that they had been censur'd, confuted, and testified against, as the most wicked and impudent <hi>forgeries</hi> that ever the sun saw. They could not have been neglected or disregarded, as too mean and trivial for particular notice: For as they were themselves of greatest importance, so were they esteem'd by the <hi>Iews</hi> (among whom these <hi>Miracles</hi> were both acted and published) of two great moment and consequence, to be slightly overlook'd. This appears by their forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied prejudice, flaming rage, and malicious opposition, both to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishers</hi> of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> Whence it plainly appears, nothing but full conviction of the truth of these <hi>Miracles,</hi> could silence all opposition, that not a Dog should move his tongue against them.</p>
            <p>BUT what very much strengthens this Argument, is not only the adversaries tacit assent to these matters of <hi>Fact</hi>; but their
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:003527_0083_0FF858A5DE743BF0"/>
explicit attestation to some of 'em. Thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Iosephus,</hi> the <hi>Iewish</hi> Historian, give us an Epitome of the life, death, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> whom he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleges a worker of great <hi>Miracles.

Part II. where many Testimonies of the Adversaries to Christianity may be found.</note>. I shall pass over many other Remarks of the like kind; and only observe, that the <hi>Iews</hi> univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally from that time till now have acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged the truth of these <hi>miraculous</hi> opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and inform us of many of them, whereof there is no mention in the <hi>Gospels.</hi> They indeed sufficiently manifest their spite and malice against Christ, by ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing (in a most ludicrous manner) His miraculous works, to wicked and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:003527_0084_0FF858A7EF5CC568"/>
Arts: But the <hi>Facts</hi> themselves they have never denied.</p>
            <p>AND now let us take a short view of the case, with respect to those <hi>miraculous gifts</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> of which we have before treated. These, at the first effusion of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> are said to have been most openly manifested, in the view of <hi>devout men, out of every Nation under Heaven,</hi> in a most public time, place, and manner: The whole World therefore had the advantage of discovering the <hi>fraud,</hi> and of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting the <hi>Story,</hi> if this Narrative had been false.—Besides, the <hi>Apostle</hi> in al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all his <hi>Epistles</hi> to the <hi>Churches,</hi> not only mentions these <hi>Gifts,</hi> as what they themselves had experienced, and were vested with: But frequently directs and exhorts 'em to a right use and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of 'em; which implies an <hi>appeal</hi> to the <hi>Churches,</hi> that there were such <hi>Gifts</hi> exercised among them. And what adds strength to the <hi>evidence</hi> is, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> reproves the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rinthians</hi> for their pride and conceit about these <hi>Gifts,</hi> which occasion'd contentions and parties amongst them (see <hi>Rom.</hi> xii.3,—8. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xii, xiii, xiv Chapters.) Now can
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:003527_0084_0FF858A7EF5CC568"/>
it be imagin'd, that any man in an <hi>Epistle</hi> to a Society, where there are heats and parties, would so particularly have direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed 'em to the use, and so largely have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd them for the abuse of such <hi>Gifts,</hi> as they must all know were not in any of them? This were not only ridiculous conduct, but perfect distraction. And what yet further strengthens this <hi>evidence</hi> is, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> puts the truth of his <hi>Doctrine</hi> and his <hi>Apostolical authority</hi> upon this proof, when some of the <hi>Churches</hi> were in a great measure drawn away from his Gospel, and prefer'd the <hi>Iewish</hi> false <hi>Apostles</hi> with their licentious Doctrines before him. This was evidently the case of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the former, unto whom the <hi>Apostle</hi> urges this Argument again and again in his <hi>First Epistle</hi> to 'em: And shews 'em that if <hi>he was not an Apostle to others, yet doubtless he was to them: For</hi> (says he) <hi>the Seal of mine Apostleship are ye in the Lord,</hi> Chap. ix.2. What this <hi>Seal</hi> or evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his <hi>Apostleship</hi> was, appears from his <hi>Second Epistle,</hi> where he resumes the same Argument, particularly in Chap. xii.12, 13. <hi>Truly the signs of an Apostle were
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:003527_0085_0FF858AB1F8B6C98"/>
wrought among you, in SIGNS and WON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERS and MIGHTY DEEDS: For what is it wherein ye were inferior to other Churches?</hi> And thus he puts the truth of his <hi>character</hi> and his <hi>Gospel</hi> upon this single evidence. Gal. iii.1, 2, 5. <hi>O foolish Galatians, who hath bewitched you, that ye should not obey the Truth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This only would I learn of you, Received you the SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT by the works of the Law; or by the hearing of Faith? He therefore that mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streth to you the SPIRIT, and worketh MIRACLES among you, doth He it by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</hi> Now can it be conceiv'd, that the <hi>Apostle</hi> would put the proof of the Truth of his <hi>Gospel,</hi> and his <hi>Apostolical character,</hi> upon <hi>Gifts</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> confer'd upon 'em by his instrumentality; and that in a dispute with <hi>false Apostles,</hi> rivalling him in those <hi>Churches,</hi> when there were no such <hi>Gifts</hi> among 'em? Such a sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is the height of absurdity. It was utterly impossible, that these <hi>Churches</hi> could be impos'd upon in this matter: And it was also impossible to impose upon the World about 'em, who had all imaginable advantages and opportunity to examine
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:003527_0085_0FF858AB1F8B6C98"/>
these <hi>Facts,</hi> and to discover their truth or falshood <note n="*" place="bottom">If any would see this Argument more largely handled, they may read the foremention'd <hi>Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellanea Sacra,</hi> from which I have taken these last hints.</note>.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole, it's as clear as the light, that the World was not, could not be impos'd upon by these reports, when they were first publish'd. Whence the <hi>Apostle</hi> boldly makes that appeal to King <hi>Agrippa,</hi> Acts xxvi.26. <hi>For the King know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: For I am persuaded, that none of these things are hidden from him: For this thing was not done in a corner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. WE have also good assurance, that these <hi>Narratives</hi> are handed down <hi>uncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted</hi> unto the present time.</p>
            <p>THE actions recorded by the <hi>sacred Writers,</hi> were notably famous in the World, such as procur'd great revolutions and alterations in States; and even <hi>turn'd the World upside down,</hi> by the conversion of so many from Superstition and Idolatry, to the true worship of <hi>God.</hi> Whence they were worthy the critical notice of every one. The <hi>Records</hi> have been kept pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:003527_0086_0FF858ACA6CC7EC0"/>
in all ages; and publickly preach'd by the <hi>Ministers of Christ,</hi> which has given the most negligent <hi>enemy</hi> advantage to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover &amp; detect any fraudulent depravation, or interpolation, had there been any such.</p>
            <p>AND what makes this clearer, multitudes of most bitter <hi>Adversaries</hi> have in every age been converted to <hi>Christianity,</hi> who could not want means to discover any <hi>fraud</hi> of this kind; nor could they profess, and even suffer and dy for a known falshood.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, the <hi>Doctrine</hi> taught in this <hi>blessed Book,</hi> rendred the professors of <hi>Christianity</hi> uncapable to corrupt it: No less than eternal damnation is therein de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced against him that shall add or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minish one jot or tittle of the <hi>Sacred Canon.</hi> Should an <hi>Angel from Heaven teach any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Doctrine</hi> than what is there taught, he is pronounced <hi>accursed.</hi> What temptation then could any have to vitiate these <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,</hi> who kept them as their <hi>Rule of life,</hi> and <hi>Charter</hi> for future Glory?</p>
            <p>THEY that were <hi>friends</hi> to <hi>Christianity</hi> and believ'd the History of these <hi>Miracles,</hi> could not corrupt them, on purpose to procure damnation to their own Souls. They that were <hi>enemies</hi> to <hi>Christianity</hi> and disbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved these truths, would not corrupt
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:003527_0086_0FF858ACA6CC7EC0"/>
them, on purpose to prepare Armour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their own Infidelity. From whence then could such a depravation come, when the interest both of <hi>friends</hi> and <hi>enemies</hi> was every way so strongly against it?</p>
            <p>BUT had any man, or Society of men, never so earnestly desir'd, and never so artfully attempted such an interpolation, it must have been without success: For these <hi>Records</hi> in the very words of the <hi>sacred Penmen,</hi> were immediately in the hands of multitudes of People, translated into various Languages, and dispers'd through <hi>all Nations,</hi> which rendred it impossible for the World to be impos'd upon, by such <hi>fraud</hi> and villainy. 'Twere easier to suppose, that a designing Knave could corrupt our <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> frame a new body of Laws for <hi>England,</hi> trump them upon us, and wheedle us into the belief, that these are and always have been the <hi>Statutes</hi> of the Nation; than to imagine the like corruption in these <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of Heaven.</hi> For the <hi>Statute-Books</hi> are in the hands of but one Nation only: the <hi>New Testament</hi> (as I observ'd) di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spers'd through the World, and found in every copy of it to agree, in attesting these miraculous Facts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="unknown:003527_0087_0FF858B19EBE9330"/>THUS have we utmost certainty, that the Accounts of these <hi>Facts,</hi> now in our hands, are the <hi>uncorrupted Writings</hi> of the <hi>Apostles</hi> and <hi>Evangelists.</hi> And thus do we see the promise hitherto fulfilled, that the <hi>Word of the Lord shall endure for ever, even that Word which by the Gospel is preached unto us,</hi> 1 Pet. i.25.</p>
            <p>WE are now prepar'd to consider,</p>
            <p n="3">III. THAT these <hi>Miracles,</hi> which I have prov'd to have been wrought by our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> both before and after His passion, are a full evidence that He was <hi>approv'd of God,</hi> and had <hi>His Mission</hi> from Him.</p>
            <p>THIS may be evinced by the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing considerations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THESE <hi>Miracles</hi> are certainly the <hi>work of God</hi> Himself: His direct agency is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly visible in them.</p>
            <p>IF it be possible for any created beings to work a true <hi>Miracle,</hi> yet such their agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy must be always under <hi>God's</hi> controul: otherwise the <hi>infernal powers</hi> might inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the revolutions of Nature, and bring the World into a <hi>chaos.</hi> Such Miracles therefore, whosoever be the instrumental agent, must be acknowledged <hi>the works of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God</hi> is Himself as near to the effect
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:003527_0087_0FF858B19EBE9330"/>
when He useth Instruments, as when He acts immediately without 'em. But I have put the present issue (as you heard before) upon such <hi>Miracles</hi> only, as are the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate effects of <hi>Omnipotence</hi>; that there can be no room either for ignorance or malice, to raise any cavil in this case. If the <hi>Facts</hi> are true (as I've already prov'd 'em to be) all the World must own, that the wonderful works which did shew forth themselves in our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> were the mighty works of <hi>God</hi>; that those <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred gifts</hi> which we have consider'd, were certainly <hi>Divine:</hi> And that these did as certainly discover <hi>God's</hi> immediate efficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, as the works of <hi>Creation.</hi> Whence it's certain, that our <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> had this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of the <hi>Deity,</hi> and this <hi>seal</hi> to His <hi>Commission,</hi> that <hi>God</hi> did by Him, and He by His <hi>Apostles,</hi> perform such stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous works, as justly amazed the World, and infinitely exceeded the power of all <hi>created Angels.</hi> And it was therefore a just and natural inference, made by <hi>Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus,</hi> Joh. iii.2. <hi>Rabbi, we kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w that thou art a Teacher come from God: For no man can do these Miracles that thou doest, except God be with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="158" facs="unknown:003527_0088_0FF858B32C873B20"/>2. IT'S contrary to the goodness and faithfulness of <hi>God</hi> to justify an <hi>Impostor,</hi> or confirm a falshood by <hi>Miracles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is impossible that we should in this imperfect state, have better evidence, that any Person or Doctrine is from <hi>God,</hi> than these <hi>Miracles</hi> are. By these we have vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly before our eyes, <hi>God's</hi> own immediate agency; We see the <hi>extraordinary</hi> display of His <hi>Omnipotent power</hi>; we certainly know that there is the immediate finger of <hi>God</hi> in these <hi>mighty works.</hi> And our <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> produces this <hi>seal</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> as a voucher to His Doctrine and Authority: He declares Himself to be the expected <hi>Messiah</hi>; and these surprizing Wonders are wrought to confirm it. He publishes by His <hi>Disciples,</hi> His Resurrection from the dead; and His Ascension into Heaven, which are also confirm'd by the same evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Both <hi>He</hi> and His <hi>Disciples</hi> appeal to the <hi>senses</hi> of mankind, that He is indeed what He declares Himself, the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and Lord of Life and Glory; and that He has indeed been <hi>declar'd the Son of God with power, by His resurrection from the dead.</hi> God justifies the appeal from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and gives the visible Testimony of <hi>Miracles,</hi> both before and after His cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion,
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:003527_0088_0FF858B32C873B20"/>
that He is His <hi>beloved Son, in whom He is well pleased. Infidelity</hi> can therefore have no place of retreat. We must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in this <hi>Saviour,</hi> or disbelieve the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation of the <hi>God</hi> of truth. If we are deceiv'd, the deceit is inevitable; and the best men in the World, who have the most sincere love to <hi>God,</hi> and despise whatever is desirable or terrible, for His sake and service, are deluded in their most impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant concerns by <hi>God</hi> Himself. Now can it be imagin'd, can we entertain the least thought, that infinite <hi>Holiness</hi> would thus justify a fraudulent Imposture; that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Faithfulness</hi> would thus seal to a lie; and that infinite <hi>Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> would thus give up the World to unavoidable error and delusion? No surely! To refuse this <hi>Testimony,</hi> is not only stupidity and madness, that trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms men into bruits; but obstinacy and malice, not far distant from the nature of <hi>devils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS we see two most faithful <hi>Witnesses,</hi> the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>veracity</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> depos'd to the truth of our <hi>Saviour's</hi> heavenly Missi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Whence we must divest our selves of reason and humanity, or yield to the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resistible force of our <hi>Lord's</hi> Argument,
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:003527_0089_0FF858B51BADB568"/>
Joh. x.37, 38. <hi>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not: But if I do, though ye believe not me, believe the works, that ye may know and believe, that the Father is in me, and I in Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I may add to all this:</p>
            <p n="3">3. THERE is no <hi>Religion</hi> under Heaven, that can bring the attestation of <hi>Miracles</hi> for its confirmation, but the <hi>Christian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> only.</p>
            <p>HERE all the Patrons of Infidelity may be challeng'd, to produce one instance since the creation of the World, that looks any thing like a parallel to the case before us. Let 'em search all the <hi>Histories</hi> of the <hi>pagan deities</hi>; let 'em call in the help of the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> or what other legendary fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles they please; and bring convincing proof of but one single <hi>miracle</hi> wrought in confirmation of any other <hi>Doctrine.</hi>—I'm sensible they can produce <hi>romantick</hi> and fabulous Histories enough, that will discover the fruitful invention of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure deceitful <hi>Authors</hi>; such as <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lostratus's</hi> Life of <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus, Mahomet's</hi> night-journey to Heaven, and the infamous <hi>Popish Legends:</hi> But what attestation have they to the truth of these <hi>Facts,</hi> and what to confirm our belief of
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:003527_0089_0FF858B51BADB568"/>
'em; but the bare reports of the unknown <hi>Authors?</hi> Just as much as can be brought to prove the seventy years sleep of <hi>Epime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nides, Lucian's</hi> true History, or any other idle <hi>Romance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF the wonders wrought by the <hi>Egyptian Sorcerers</hi> be here objected; the answer is easy. They were none of 'em <hi>Miracles</hi> of this superior kind, which we have now been considering: none of 'em necessarily discover'd the immediate agency of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Omnipotence.</hi> Besides, they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately controlled by greater <hi>miracles,</hi> in which the <hi>Magicians</hi> themselves were forc'd to acknowlege the finger of God: And therefore they were an attestation to nothing else, but <hi>Satan's</hi> impotent malice and shameful foil. <hi>God</hi> serv'd Himself of these <hi>Wonders</hi>; thereby taking occasion to glorify His own <hi>superior power.</hi> And He might probably permit them for that very end. No man could be deceived by 'em, when there was such an obvious preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Upon the whole, I may sum up this <hi>evidence,</hi> by applying of that Text to the present case, in Joh. xv.24. <hi>If Christ had not done such w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="unknown:003527_0090_0FF858B6D1438A58"/>BEFORE I proceed to a particular <hi>Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi> of this <hi>Doctrine,</hi> I would here more particularly observe, that whatever has been said to verify the <hi>Divine Mission</hi> of our <hi>Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> may equally serve to confirm the truth and heavenly origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of the whole <hi>Christian Religion.</hi> The <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and the <hi>Person</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> are au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized of <hi>God,</hi> by the same <hi>seal</hi> of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. If the <hi>Lord Iesus</hi> be indeed the <hi>Son of God</hi> and <hi>Redeemer</hi> of mankind, His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions must be worthy of His glorious Nature and Office. If the <hi>Apostles,</hi> and other holy Writers, were indeed <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission'd</hi> and <hi>inspir'd</hi> of Him, they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually uncapable to deceive us, in an affair of everlasting consequence.</p>
            <p>IF it be demanded, how can we be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the <hi>sacred Penmen</hi> were <hi>Divinely inspir'd,</hi> in writing the <hi>New Testament?</hi> I answer, we have the same assurance of this, as of the matters of <hi>Fact</hi> by them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. They themselves attest it. They have prov'd themselves persons of probity and integrity. They could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in this matter, but must certainly know whether they were acted by a <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Inspiration,</hi> or not. They could have no temporal inducement, to obtrude false

               <hi>Doctrine,</hi> any more than false <hi>History</hi> upon us; but sealed both with their <hi>blood.</hi> And we have the same security, that both have been handed down uncorrupted to our times.</p>
            <p>To all which we have this additional evidence, that <hi>God</hi> declared from <hi>Heaven</hi> his approbation of their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> by the <hi>gifts</hi> of the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> confer'd upon them. <hi>Christ</hi> promised them this <hi>seal</hi> to their <hi>Commission,</hi> that <hi>the works that He did, they should do also; and greater works than these, when He was gone to the Father,</hi> Joh. xiv.12. And that <hi>He would send the promise of His Father upon them; and endue them with Power from on high,</hi> Luk. xxiv.49. Which <hi>promise</hi> was visibly verified to 'em. The <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> did (as was promis'd) descend from <hi>Heaven</hi> upon 'em, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly invest them with the knowlege of <hi>various Languages</hi> (so that they could speak them with their peculiar idioms and accents) and with the several other <hi>gifts,</hi> which we have before consider'd; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were qualified to travel through the Nations, and universally publish the glad tidings of Salvation. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they went, <hi>they made the Gentiles obedient, by word and deed, through mighty Signs and Wonders, by the Power of the Spirit
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:003527_0091_0FF858B928FE6280"/>
of God,</hi> Rom. xv.18, 19. They every where confirm'd their <hi>Doctrine,</hi> by leaving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind 'em some <hi>miraculous</hi> blessing, either upon the body, or mind, or both. Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents were tamed, devils ejected, the sick healed, and the dead raised at their word. And we have the most unquestionable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of these <hi>Facts,</hi> that we can have of any thing not done in our own sight, as you heard before. We are therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain'd to give a full and entire assent to all the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> as <hi>what God has born Witness to, both with signs and wonders; and with divers Miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to His own will,</hi> Heb. ii.4.

with <hi>Philip,</hi> Joh. i.45. <hi>We have found Him, of whom Moses in the Law and the Prophets did write, Iesus of Nazareth the son of Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph.</hi> Whence you'll all be ready to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress our <hi>Lord,</hi> in the language of <hi>Natha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nael, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God, thou art the King of Israel.</hi> But it concerns you also to consider, that <hi>Christ came to save His people from their sins,</hi> and not in them. He came <hi>to redeem us from all iniquity; and to purify unto Himself a peculiar people, zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous of good works.</hi> And the design of the <hi>Gospel</hi> is, <hi>to turn men from darkness unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> Christianity consists not meerly in specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, but in practice. We must not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give our assent to the <hi>truth</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> but give up our hearts to <hi>Christ.</hi> The <hi>Faith</hi> which He requires, is not a slight superficial belief, that He is the <hi>Redeemer</hi> of mankind; but such a <hi>Faith</hi> as will form us into subjection and obedience to Himself.</p>
               <p>Do we believe that <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is our <hi>only Saviour,</hi> what stupidity, what madness then is it, to reject or neglect Him, and His tendered Salvation, to retain our lusts and perish in them!

be deaf to all its gracious invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and despise all its promises and threatnings, as if they were meer <hi>Fables!</hi> Are we lifted up to <hi>Heaven</hi> by the exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitions of so <hi>great a Salvation</hi>; and shall we nevertheless cast our selves down to Hell, by wilfully refusing it, and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring our sinful pleasures before it! This is not only to reproach our holy profession; but to bring such a degree of guilt upon our own Souls, as will render us most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable, and most aggravatedly misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at last. Let <hi>us</hi> therefore <hi>that name the name of Christ, depart from iniquity.</hi> Let His Throne be set up in our hearts, that all our faculties may bow down to Him. Let us chuse Him for our portion, seek an interest in Him with importunate ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestness and diligence, depend upon Him as <hi>the Lord our Righteousness,</hi> and live to Him with our whole hearts. If we thus come to Him, He will in no wise cast us out: But otherwise, our most flourishing profession will not secure us from having our portion with Hypocrites and Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, in the day of <hi>Retribution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am sensible, that there lies an <hi>Objection</hi> yet in our way: Some may be ready to say, <hi>How shall we know in what</hi> way <hi>to

               <p>THIS <hi>Objection,</hi> I confess, may procure <hi>trouble</hi> and difficulty to some sincere and well-minded persons; as well as <hi>offence</hi> and scandal to them of a wavering and unsettled <hi>Faith.</hi> I shall therefore spend the remaining time before us, in obviating this difficulty; and in giving you plain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, how you may be infallibly secure of serving <hi>Christ</hi> acceptably here; and of inheriting the reward of a <hi>patient conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in well-doing</hi> hereafter.</p>

and to His <hi>Righteousness</hi> for justification; to ly at the footstool of His grace, with a humble sense of our own nothingness, and with importunate suits for the sanctifying influences of His <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> whereby we may <hi>receive Christ Iesus the Lord, and walk in Him.</hi> If we are chargeable with many mistakes, in matters not essential to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; yet being cloathed with the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> we shall appear <hi>without spot and blameless, the sons of God, without rebuke,</hi> in the great day of trial.

have some way or other expos'd those fundamental Articles of our <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Hope,</hi> the <hi>Sovereignty of free Grace in our Sanctification,</hi> and <hi>the necessity of Christ's imputed Righteousness, in order to our Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication and acceptance with God.</hi> But <hi>my Soul, come not thou into their secret: mine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, be not thou united to their assembly,</hi> who thus depreciate the <hi>grace of God,</hi> and the <hi>satisfaction of Christ,</hi> and thus subvert the whole scope and design of the <hi>Gospel.</hi> Let us avoid all such errors, as most dangerous shelves and quicksands, in our voyage to Heaven, whoever profess 'em, and with what colours soever they are painted; And venture our Salvation only upon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited <hi>Mercy,</hi> hoping to be <hi>justified freely by God's Grace, through the Redemption that is in Iesus Christ,</hi> Rom. iii.24. —Let <hi>Christ</hi> have all the glory of our Salvation now, that we may hereafter join with those that shall ascribe <hi>Glory and Dominion, for ever and ever, to Him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in His own blood; and made us Kings and Priests, unto God and His Father.</hi>

Let it be your care to <hi>keep the Ordinances as they have been delivered to you</hi> in the holy Scriptures: And while you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to this Rule, be not ashamed to confess, that <hi>after the way, which some call Heresy</hi> or Schism, <hi>so worship you the God of your Fathers.</hi> It must be the character of every true <hi>Christian,</hi> that he endeavours to <hi>walk in all the Commandments and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Lord, blameless,</hi> Luk. i.6. Tho' the means of Grace may want all that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal pomp, beauty, or ornament, that will recommend them to a carnal eye, as worthy of special regard; yet how weak and foolish soever they may appear, they are the <hi>institutions</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> which He will therefore own and bless. <hi>It has pleased God by the foolishness of</hi> His Ordinances <hi>to save them that believe,</hi> 1 Cor. i.21. And we have no reason to hope for Salvation, in the contempt or wilful neglect of them. If we would find <hi>Christ,</hi> we must seek him where He walks, <hi>in the midst of His golden Candlesticks.</hi> If we would inherit the blessing, we must <hi>watch daily at Christ's gates, and wait at the posts of His doors.</hi> Whoever pretend any other way to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi>

than this path of <hi>Ordinances,</hi> which God has mark'd out for us, <hi>after the first and second admonition reject</hi> them.</p>

               </p>
               <p>THERE will be different sentiments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Christians, as long as we are on this side <hi>Iordan.</hi> We shall not come to an exact <hi>unity</hi> in all Articles of <hi>Faith,</hi> until <hi>that which is in part shall be done away; and we know even as also we are known.</hi> But can't we bear with the different thoughts, as well as different complections of those that agree with us in the essentials of <hi>Christianity</hi>; and <hi>receive one another, as Christ also received us, to the glory of God?</hi> Have we no way to approve our selves <hi>Disciples</hi> of the <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> but by wranglings, contentions, strife and debate? This is a direct means to destroy all practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Religion; and wholly root out all se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>vital Piety.</hi>

               <p>IT'S true, we can't our selves be of two contrary persuasions. It's of necessity, that we part ways with those, in some disputed points, with whom we may agree in the main Foundations of our Faith and

Hope; and with whom we hope to join in eternal <hi>Anthems of praise.</hi> But how shall <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>weak Christians</hi> act in this case? How shall they know with what party to join? It's impossible that I should now descend to particular Directions in this case; I must therefore content my self with commending that general rule of the <hi>Apostle,</hi> 2 Tim. ii.22. <hi>Follow righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, faith, CHARITY, peace, with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</hi> Never herd your selves with those that are for cutting off all the <hi>Protestant Churches,</hi> but themselves, from the <hi>fold of Christ</hi>; nor expect to be sav'd by damning every body but your selves.</p>
               <p>FINALLY, Constantly and fervently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit your Souls to the keeping and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of our Lord <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi>

               <p>WE are liable to a thousand <hi>mistakes</hi>; but we have a safe and sure <hi>Pilot,</hi> upon whom we may boldly depend. <hi>If we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our way to Him, He will bring it to pass.</hi> If He leaves us to lesser <hi>mistakes,</hi> He will save us from <hi>damning errors,</hi> unless our own sin and sloth put us out of His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.
