            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT ſame Spirit of Pride and Malice, which the Phariſees manifeſted towards our bleſſed Lord himſelf, whilſt ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling his Miniſtry in the Fleſh, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed very much againſt his Church after his Death, and Aſcenſion into Heaven; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Church of Chriſt at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was greatly oppreſſed, and many were afraid to unite themſelves to it, for fear they ſhould fall under the Diſpleaſure of the Rulers; and eſpecially were the Rich and Great unwilling to hazard their All for the Sake of Religion, ſo that the Number of Believers conſiſted chiefly of the poorer Sort, who were not well able to ſupport the Goſpel. St. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004883_0004_100E08AF8647BE08"/>
to the Gentiles, endeavours to ſtir up a Spirit of Charity amongſt them; and tells them, <hi>they were Debtors to the Jews,</hi> and <hi>ought to give them of their carnal Things, ſince they had ſo largely received of their ſpiritual Things,</hi> ver. 27. (Such was the Temper, and ſuch the primitive Spirit in the Days of the Apoſtles; and would to God there was more of it handed down to us in theſe remote Ages.) And when the Apoſtle had obtained a Collection among the Gentiles, and was going up to Jeruſalem to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the ſame to the Saints, he writes this Epiſtle from <hi>Corinth</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi>; wherein he informs the Chriſtians there, that when he ſhould Journey into <hi>Spain,</hi> he purpoſed to come to them, and aſſures them he ſhould come to them in the Fulneſs of the Bleſſings of the Goſpel of Chriſt, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. And therefore he beſeeches them to ſtrive in Prayer for him to God. In the Words we may obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Duty recommended, and this is <hi>ſtriving.</hi> And he lets them know he was engaged in it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Strive together with me.</hi> He does indeed tell us, 2 Tim. 2.24. <hi>That it is not lawful for a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Lord to ſtrive.</hi> But there he uſes a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Word <hi>(Macheſthai)</hi> which ſignifies to contend in Anger and with Weapons: But the Word here rendred <hi>ſtrive,</hi> is (<hi>Agoniſaſthai</hi>) to be in an Agony, or to agonize; and the ſame Word is uſed, <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.24.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Manner of ſtriving; and that is, in <hi>Prayer</hi>: in which we are to be in an Agony. Thus <hi>Jacob</hi> wreſtled in Prayer, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.24. So Chriſt himſelf was in an Agony in Prayer, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. And <hi>Epaphras</hi> laboured fervently in Prayer, <hi>Col.</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:004883_0005_100E08B1B40C66E0"/>
4.12. Our Prayers ſhould all be fervent and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrought Prayers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What it is the Apoſtle urged them thus earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſtrive for in Prayer; and it was, that <hi>he might come unto them in the fulneſs of the Bleſſing of the Goſpel of Chriſt</hi>; that <hi>he might come to them with Joy by the Will of God, and be refreſhed with them,</hi> verſes 29, &amp; 32.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Motives to this Duty of earneſt Prayer for him. And they are the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt's ſake,</hi> and <hi>the Love of the Spirit.</hi> As if the Apoſtle had ſaid; be it ſo you have no Love for me, yet if you have any Deſire to advance the Kingdom of your Lord; and have any Deſire to feel the bleſſed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences of the Spirit upon your own Hearts, and ſee the Operations thereof upon others, then pray for me, that my Miniſtry may be proſpered.</p>
            <p>Hence the
<q>
                  <hi>DOCT.</hi> That it greatly concerns both Miniſters, and People, to unite their earneſt Endeavours, and moſt fervent Prayers to God, that the great Ends and Purpoſes of the Miniſtry may be anſwered.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When our Lord had purchaſed a Church here with his own Blood, and was about to aſcend up on high; he did not leave it comfortleſs; but ſent down his Holy Spirit, which wonderfully filled the Hearts of his People: nor did he leave his Church without Means and Helps for it's Growth and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; but gave Gifts to Men, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8. He was pleaſed to conſtitute an Order of Men to teach and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004883_0006_100E08B34EE0CAC8"/>
build Men up in the Faith, and graciouſly has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them his Preſence to the End of the World.</p>
            <p>Now, do we conſider what their Buſineſs is, who it is that ſends them forth to it, and how they muſt e're it be long, render an Account to him: how does it concern them in an eſpecial Manner to be fervent in Spirit ſerving the Lord? Mankind are ready to think the Work of the Miniſtry is an eaſy Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, very much freed from all Difficulties; and many have envied them their Eaſe; yea it is to be feared ſome have left their ſecular Employments, and turned into the Miniſtry, that they might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge greater Sloth and Idleneſs: But ſuch Men are groſly ignorant of the ſharp Conflicts &amp; ſevere Agonies, which attend a faithful Diſcharge of the Miniſtry. Oftentimes Earth and Hell unite againſt them.</p>
            <p>Wherefore a People are not to look upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves altogether unconcerned about the Miniſtry; whether it be ſucceeded or not; but muſt do all in their Power to promote the great Deſigns of it: they muſt do nothing to oppoſe, and hinder it themſelves; and when they ſee it labouring under Difficulties, and Oppoſitions, they may not ſit ſtill, and leave Miniſters to grapple with them; but muſt appear for their Help, and ſay to them as the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple once did, to <hi>Ezra,</hi> Chap. 10.4. <hi>Ariſe, for this Matter belongeth unto thee; we alſo will be with thee, be of good Courage and do it.</hi> It is of great Concern, that a People as well as Miniſters do what they can to forward the Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>But in handling this Doctrine I propoſe,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:004883_0007_100E08B62EE93B48"/>Firſt, <hi>To ſhow what it is that Miniſters &amp; People are to endeavour after and pray earneſtly for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Point out the Manner in which they are to ſeek the Advancement of the Miniſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Give ſome Reaſons of the Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Apply the Truth to Miniſters and People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt then, <hi>I am to ſhow what it is Miniſters and People are to endeavour after and pray earneſtly for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in general, it is the Glory of God by the Salvation of Men in the Way of the Goſpel. The Glory of God is the great End of our Creation, and it is what we ſhould always aim at in our Actions. As we are Men we ſhould endeavour ſo to live that God may be honoured by us: and as we are Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Chriſtians we are eſpecially concerned to promote the Honour and Glory of God, by ſeeking our own, and the Salvation of others, in that Way revealed by Chriſt in the Goſpel: And in order to this,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Miniſters muſt ſtrive and even be in an Agony, till Chriſt be formed in their own Souls, and the Souls of their Hearers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men are not always converted when they enter into the Miniſtry: many Inſtances there have been of their Converſion by their own Miniſtry. But if this be the Caſe of any Miniſters not to be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, how ſhould they cry to God Day and Night for pardoning and ſanctifying Mercy? And give no Peace to themſelves till they are born of the Spirit of God: <hi>leſt whilſt they preach the Goſpel of Chriſt to others, they be a Caſtaway themſelves,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.27. How ſhould they wreſtle in Prayer till they know the Work of God upon the Heart, and can feelingly
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004883_0008_100E08B7B3A3ECC8"/>
pitty, and travail in Birth with others? And when this happy Change is effected in their own Souls; how ſhould they ſtrive and agonize in Prayer <hi>till Chriſt be formed in the Souls of their Hearers?</hi> Gal. 4.19.</p>
            <p>And if Miniſters have ever felt the Terrors of the Law, and experienced the Comforts of God's Spirit, they can't be eaſy till their People are bro't out of a State of Sin and Death into the Favour of God, they will not reſt till they have reſcued them from the Hands of the Devil, and introduced them into the Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters muſt take much Pains for the Converſion of their Hearers; and eſpecially if at any Time they perceive a good Work begun in their Souls: they ſhould never give over till it end in a thoro' Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to God.</p>
            <p>And at the ſame Time that Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel are travailing in Birth for their own and the Souls of others, a People muſt join with them and pray earneſtly for them. <hi>Have any of you an unconverted Miniſter, you may not reject him even for that; you have no ſuch Warrant from the Word of God; to do this would be to impeach the Wiſdom of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, who commanded the Hearers to obſerve and do all that the Scribes and Phariſees taught them.</hi> Mat. 23.2, 3. <hi>And it would be to make your ſelves wiſer than the Wiſdom of God, who choſe one to the Apoſtleſhip whom he knew was in a State of Nature; and at that very Time foreſaw he would lift up his Heel againſt him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your Duty in ſuch a Caſe is to pray earneſtly to God for him; that he may be made of God a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

experimental Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt. And is your Miniſter labouring for the Converſion of you or yours, can you neglect ſtriving with him, 'till ſuch a bleſſed Work be effected in you?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Miniſters and People are unitedly to endeavour to uphold and promote real Piety and Godlineſs among themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Miniſters muſt ſtrive to be exemplary themſelves, to be Patterns of Patience, Holineſs and heavenly Mindedneſs; they muſt reſiſt all Temptations to Lewdneſs and Vanity. It is a great Reproach to Religion when Men, who bear the Character of Chriſt's Ambaſſadors, give themſelves up to Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, and have no Government over their Paſſions and Appetites. But this has been unhappily ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Caſe to the great Diſhonour of Chriſt. Would we be Miniſters of our aſcended Lord and glorified Redeemer, we muſt avoid every Thing, which tends to bring our ſelves and his Doctrines into Contempt.</p>
            <p>And all ſuch as profeſs themſelves Chriſtians muſt be very watchful over themſelves, and <hi>walk circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly, not as Fools but as Wiſe, redeeming the Time,</hi> Eph. 5.15, 16. They muſt avoid all Appearances of Evil, and live up to the Character they ſuſtain. Nor is it enough here, that Miniſters and People are externally ſober and religious; but they muſt keep up the <hi>Life and Power of Godlineſs, as well as the Form of it,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.5.</p>
            <p>And do Miniſters and People at any Time ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Religion dying, how ſhould they ſtrive toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to revive it? Is any Sin prevailing and grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rampant; they muſt awake to put a Stop to it,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004883_0010_100E08BC05266F88"/>
and face it down: It is not enough that Miniſters exert themſelves; but a People muſt alſo join their ſtrongeſt Endeavours and moſt ſervent Prayers: they muſt ſtrengthen the Hands, and encourage the Hearts of Miniſters; as they in <hi>Ezra</hi> 10.4. <hi>forecited.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Miniſters and People are concerned to do all in them lies to preſerve Peace and good Order amongſt themſelves.</hi> Chriſt's Bleſſing to his Church was <hi>Peace.</hi> Joh. 14.27. And the Goſpel often enjoins Peace upon the Followers of Chriſt. Hence we are commanded <hi>to live peaceably as much as poſſible,</hi> Rom. 12.18. and to <hi>follow the Things which make for Peace,</hi> Rom. 14.19. And Peace amongſt a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is very neceſſary in order to the flouriſhing of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: The Spirit of God will not dwell in the midſt of War and Contention. How watchful therefore ſhould Miniſters and People be that they don't fall into Strifes and Animoſities? Satan is always ready to caſt in Bones of Contention: Miniſters muſt ſtrive ſo to live that they may give none Offence to any; and that Satan may have nothing to improve againſt them to deſtroy their Uſefulneſs: And a People muſt avoid all Occaſions of Contention, by living in Love, by bearing with, and forgiving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And is any Feud ſpringing up, how does it concern us all to quench the Coals?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Miniſters and People muſt unite their Endeavours and Prayers that the Doctrines of Chriſt may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved pure and unmixed with Errors.</hi> We are all bound <hi>earneſtly to contend for the Faith,</hi> Jude 3. And eſpecially ſhould it be of a great Concern to ſuch, as are appointed to teach the Truth to others, to be well grounded themſelves in the Truth. Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004883_0011_100E08BF01A883C8"/>
may not indifferently embrace any Tenets; thinking it no Matter ſo their People are eaſy with them; but they muſt examine the Truth, and when they are well inſtructed in it, muſt teach it to others: and they are commanded <hi>to convince Gainſayers,</hi> Tit. 1.9. And is any Hereſy ſpringing up at any Time, they muſt make a vigorous Oppoſition; and a People muſt aſſiſt them herein, leſt the Corruption become epidemical, and prove fatal to the Souls of many.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So alſo it equally concerns Miniſters &amp; People to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Worſhip of God unmixed with the Inventions and Superſtitions of Men. Moſes</hi> in building the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, was to follow exactly the Pattern ſhewn him in the Mount: So we in all our Worſhip ſhould pattern after the Mind of God revealed in his Word. We muſt keep up a holy Jealouſy for God's Worſhip, and be always ready to reſcue it from the Impoſitions of Men, which however plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing they may be to carnal Reaſon, yet are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by God, and unſafe for us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Miniſters and People muſt do all they can to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port Chriſt's Authority in his Church, that his Laws and Government may take Place upon Tranſgreſſors.</hi> That Chriſt has left Authority in his Church is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. &amp; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. In whoſe Hands it is repoſited, I ſhall not now attempt to determine; nor is it neceſſary it ſhould be decided, would Miniſters and People aſſiſt and ſtrengthen one another, and both do what in them lies to reclaim Sinners and bring them to Repentance; but ſo long as Miniſters and People are jealous of one another, and all they aim at is to engroſs the Power into their own Hands; and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004883_0012_100E08C086DE6858"/>
refuſe to ſtrengthen one another, Things will grow worſe and worſe if poſſible. It is a Reproach to Chriſtians, that there is ſcarce ſo much as a Shadow of Government in the Church; and it is ſo hard a Matter to bring Offenders to humble themſelves: and obſtinate Men cannot be brought to ſubmit to Order. Happy would it be, would Miniſters and People unite to recover the ſinking Authority of Chriſt in particular Churches; <hi>ſince we can't have any Help from Councils of Churches:</hi> Authority is as neceſſary in a Church as in a Kingdom: and the more this ſinks, the more will Religion die with it. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters therefore muſt bear a Teſtimony againſt Offenders; muſt boldly call them to an Account; and a People muſt ſtrengthen a Miniſter's Hands and encourage his Heart herein; and may not juſtify the Wicked, as is too commonly the Caſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>It concerns Miniſters and People to endeavour to ſupport the Honour and Credit of the Miniſtry.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a corrupt and degenerate Age may deſpiſe Men of a ſacred Character; yet certainly the Work of the Miniſtry is the moſt honourable Employment in the World: and Chriſt aſſures us, <hi>that ſuch as deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe them deſpiſe him,</hi> Luk. 10.16. He will have them <hi>eſteemed highly for their Works ſake,</hi> 1 Theſ. 5.13. and <hi>accounted worthy of double Honour,</hi> 1 Tim. 5.17. And when we conſider how much the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the Miniſtry depends upon the Eſteem Men have of Miniſters themſelves, ſhall not both they and a People do all they can to advance their Credit and Reputation? They muſt themſelves live ſo holy and exemplary, that none may have any Reaſon to Cenſure and Reproach them. They muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004883_0013_100E08C20D80A270"/>
themſelves to the Conſciences of Men. Their Lives and Converſations muſt be ſuch as will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Reverence from Men: But then Miniſters are <hi>Men of like Paſſions, and ſubject to like Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with other Men,</hi> Act. 14.15. And if they do any Thing inconſiſtent with their Character, and Calling; a People muſt bear with their Infirmities, overlook, and cover their Failings. God has guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Reputation better than any Mens whatever, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.19. How afraid then ſhould you be to ſpeak Evil of them, as is the common Practice of Mankind? <hi>As tho' they hired them into the Miniſtry, to let looſe reproachful Words of them?</hi> But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Care God has taken to preſerve the Reputation of Miniſters, how ready are Men to ſpread every Failing they are guilty of to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Diſtance? But when Miniſters are thus wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their Reputations, their Uſefulneſs is greatly deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>And in order to <hi>your upholding the Credit of the Miniſtry, you muſt ſupport them honourably who labour for your Souls</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God commanded that <hi>the Ox which treadeth out the Corn ſhould not be muzzled,</hi> Deut. 25.4. Which the Apoſtle applies to the preſent Caſe, 1 Cor. 9.9, 10. And he lets us know there is the ſame Reaſon <hi>they who preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel; as they who attended upon the Altar ſhould be Partakers of the Altar,</hi> Verſes 13, 14. But it is certain, the Prieſts under the Law were allowed by God a vaſtly greater Maintenance than Men are willing to allow Miniſters of the Goſpel. It is a vain Imagination ſome Men have, that if Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are kept poor and dependant, they will be
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004883_0014_100E08C44F61E590"/>
more faithful, that they may not be rejected by the People: This is the Way to make them Servants to Mens Humours, inſtead of Servants to their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; if they are kept mean and low, they will not have Courage to reprove Men boldly, and face down their darling Sins: <hi>their Strength is not the Strength of Stones, nor their Fleſh Braſs,</hi> Job 6.12. And if they are kept poor and dependant, when Troubles ariſe and Men evil intreat them, they are ready to ſink, and know not how to perſiſt in their Work. <hi>And it is to be feared this has overborn and waſted the Spirits of ſome of the faithful Servants of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I am to ſhow in what <hi>Way and Manner Miniſters and People are to endeavour to promote the great Ends of the Miniſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the particular Way the Apoſtle points out to us all is <hi>Prayer:</hi> Yet we are not to ſuppoſe this is the only Method Miniſters and People are to uſe, for the Light of Nature, and the Word of God it ſelf, will teach us to add to Prayer all reaſonable Means and Endeavours; but as we are intirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant upon God and Chriſt for our Salvation, and can do nothing of our ſelves; ſo nothing is more reaſonable than this, that we ſhould make known all our Wants to God, and commit all our Cares to him by Prayer; He alone can proſper our Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and grant us our Deſires. And eſpecially ſhould Miniſters of Chriſt be frequent in this Duty of Prayer; they are altogether of themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient for this Work, and <hi>all their Sufficiency is of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.5. And how earneſtly ſhould they implore upon their Knees the compaſſionate Preſence
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004883_0015_100E08C682D2F620"/>
of their Lord, and the gracious Influences of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, to conduct them into the Paths of Truth, and ſave them from the endleſs Labyrinths of Error? That he would Support and Comfort them under all the great Difficulties and Diſcouragements they meet with in their Work? How ſhould they ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize in Prayer, and plead for the Influence of the Spirit in all their more private or publick Services? That both in their Studies, and in the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they may approve themſelves to God, and be faithful Miniſters of the New Teſtament? They muſt alſo be much in Prayer for their People; muſt carry all their Caſes to God. <hi>They muſt confeſs and bewail their Sins before God, and intreat God to ſpare them,</hi> Joel 2.17. Yea they muſt do this, when God ſeems to be ready to deſtroy them: Miniſters may not hide themſelves in the Day of God's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Miniſters muſt plead with God for all the Mercies their People want; and eſpecially for the Graces of his Holy Spirit upon them. <hi>Miniſters muſt be well acquainted with the State of their Flocks,</hi> Prov. 27.23. That they may ſuit their Prayers to their various Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And at the ſame Time that Miniſters are thus wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in Prayer, a People muſt alſo lift up holy Hands to God, and labour earneſtly in Prayer for their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and themſelves.</hi> It is not enough that you put up ſome cold Petitions for your Miniſters on Lord's Days; and yet perhaps this is more than many, who would be accounted Chriſtians, do. You muſt wreſtle in Prayer for them, that God would be with them; direct, aſſiſt, ſucceed and proſper them in their Work; and this ſhould be Matter of your daily Prayer, both in the Cloſet and Family; ſo alſo how
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004883_0016_100E08C8B1A9D248"/>
earneſt muſt you be in Prayer for your ſelves, that God would keep you from Sin, and guide you in the Paths of Life and Peace.</p>
            <p>But as Miniſters and People ſtand in different Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations to one another, it concerns them to ſtrive in different Ways to forward and ſucceed the Miniſtry.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Then, <hi>as to Miniſters they muſt take much Pains to be furniſhed with Knowledge for their Work.</hi> They <hi>muſt give themſelves to reading, and attend continually upon theſe Things,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.13, <hi>&amp;</hi> 15. That they may handle the Word of God skilfully, and be <hi>Workmen that need not to be aſhamed,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.15. They <hi>muſt convince Gainſayers,</hi> Tit. 1.9. and give to every one his Portion in due Seaſon; which they never can do unleſs they are Men of Knowledge and acquainted with Learning of diverſe Sorts. It is in vain for Miniſters to pretend they need not take Pains for their Diſcourſes; and that the Spirit of God will ſuggeſt Truths while they are ſpeaking. We are not ſo to expect the Aſſiſtance of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit at the preſent Day. We muſt <hi>ſearch out accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Words,</hi> Eccl. 12.10. <hi>However Men of ſuch a Stamp who deſpiſe humane Learning and Study may be admired and followed when Men are over heated with Zeal; it is certain they cannot laſt long; and in a little Time their Folly will be known to all Men; and the World will as much deſpiſe them, as now they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire and careſs them.</hi> A Miniſter may at ſome Times have a Call to enter into the Desk with but little previous Meditation &amp; Preparation; but always to do this, is Preſumption, and inexcuſable Arrogance.</p>
            <p>And while we are compoſing our Sermons, we muſt endeavour to ſuit them to the Conſciences of Men, and not to their itching Ears: We muſt ſtrive
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004883_0017_100E08CB1C304348"/>
for ſuch Words as will awaken Mens Hopes and Fears, and make them engaged for the Salvation of their Souls; and not ſtudy for poliſhed Words and ſtrains of Rhetorick, which will ſoar above Mens Underſtandings, and make no laſting Impreſſion upon their Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And not only muſt Miniſters ſtrive to compoſe their Sermons well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but muſt take Pains in the delivery of them.</hi> I ſhall not pretend to determine whether it ought to be with, or without reading their written Notes: I think there is much needleſs Diſpute in this Matter: and after all there is Liberty of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. But let the Way and Manner be what it will, Miniſters muſt ſpeak in the Name of God, and with Authority. Their Words, their Geſture, and very Countenance muſt diſcover them in earneſt for the Salvation of Souls. Miniſters muſt not be cold and lifeleſs in the Desk; but ſhould <hi>be Flames of Fire,</hi> Heb. 1.7. When they addreſs themſelves to Sinners, they muſt be Sons of Thunder, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the Terrors of the Law in ſuch a Manner that Fear and Trembling may take hold on them. And when they ſpeak to awakened and weary Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, it muſt be with ſuch Tenderneſs &amp; Compaſſion that they may be drawn to Chriſt for Life and Reſt. If Miniſters are cold and lifeleſs in their Delivery, they will make careleſs and dead Hearers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So alſo they muſt take much Pains in their publick Prayers</hi>; and manifeſt ſuch earneſtneſs, and ſo ſuit themſelves to the State of their Flocks, that they may command the Attention of the People. And in all their Converſation they muſt endeavour ſo to behave themſelves, ſo to teach, exhort, and reprove
<pb n="16"
                   facs="unknown:004883_0018_100E08CCCEE1EBD8"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
Men privately, that all may profit by them, as well as in their publick Miniſtry.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>On the other Hand a People muſt (according to the Relation they ſtand in to Miniſters) take much Pains that the Miniſtry may be ſucceeded.</hi> A People muſt then take due Care to attain to a ſuitable Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Heart to attend upon the preaching of the Word of God. <hi>You muſt break up the fallow Ground of your Hearts,</hi> Jer. 4.3. That the Seed to be ſown may be received into good Ground. If you come to the publick Worſhip without any Preparation of Soul, you cannot expect to profit by what is delivered to you: It will be no more than a dead Letter. And is not this one great Reaſon why Multitudes have heard Thouſands of Sermons, and never profited at all by them? If Hearers do not awake the Powers of their Souls with Meditation and Prayer to hear the Word preached, Miniſters may ordinarily preach to dead Walls and lifeleſs Images, to as much Advantage.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You muſt alſo embrace all Opportunities to hear the Word preached, and not neglect aſſembling your ſelves together,</hi> Heb. 10.25. What will all the Study and Pains of a Miniſter avail, if you will not attend upon their Miniſtry? You muſt willingly miſs no Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of hearing, leſt you miſs of ſome Truth that might awaken, convince, and comfort your Souls.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And you muſt strive to hear aright what is preached to you,</hi> Mar. 4.24. You muſt take Pains to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it, and not allow your Tho'ts to wander to the Ends of the Earth; nor your ſelves drowned in Sleep, while Truths of the greateſt Importance are delivered to you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And you muſt take much Pains to treaſure up in
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004883_0019_100E08CF05904160"/>
your Memories; that you may pray over what you hear.</hi> It is unhappily the Caſe of many Hearers, they never carry any Thing from the Houſe of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But would you profit by the Miniſtry, you muſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten think of what you hear, and pray over it, that God would bleſs it to your Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And you muſt be careful to practice what you hear from Time to Time</hi>; otherwiſe it will be of no Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to you, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.24,—27. Many think if they hear good Diſcourſes and commend them, they anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer their Duty; and are eaſy if they never put them in Practice; but the End of Hearing is to Practice: and how careful ſhould you be to Practice what you hear, leſt the wicked One take it from you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And to ſum up all here with reſpect to a People, would you ſtrive together with Miniſters to promote their Miniſtry; you muſt govern your own Families.</hi> And herein you will make their Work much eaſier, and more happy: Hereby you may do much towards the Peace of a Church, and flouriſhing of Religion; but if you are negligent in this Point, you will lay a Foundation for Rebellion &amp; Trouble in the Church. If Children are not bound to obey at Home, they will not ſubmit either to Miniſters or Magiſtrates. It is what God mentions of <hi>Abraham</hi> to his Honour, <hi>that he governed his Houſhold,</hi> Gen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 18.19. And a Want of this has been the Cauſe of ſo much Trouble and Vexation to Miniſters; and ſuch a World of Diſorder and Confuſion in Church &amp; State. Would you then help and encourage Miniſters of the Goſpel, you muſt train up your Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Proceed we now to give ſome Reaſons of the Doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:004883_0020_100E08D1338E3630"/>1. Then, <hi>when we conſider how very great and noble the Ends and Deſigns of the Miniſtry are</hi>; it is enough to animate Miniſters and People to do all they can to promote the ſame: Now <hi>theſe are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhort of the Glory of God, and the eternal well-being of immortal Souls.</hi> What can we better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our ſelves about, and ſpend our Strength for, than theſe? Theſe are worthy our higheſt Ambition, and well deſerve our warmeſt Endeavours. Can we do too much for God's Honour, or the Salvation of our own Souls? And theſe are what the Miniſtry is aiming at.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The greatneſs and weightineſs of this Work of the Miniſtry calls for the mutual Endeavours of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and People.</hi> Have Miniſters ſo much upon their Hands, and will they not be concerned to accompliſh the ſame? Can they loiter, and indulge Sloth? And have a People any Pity for Miniſters, and know how great a Burden they ſuſtain, can they refuſe to aſſiſt, encourage and ſtrengthen them? God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his People <hi>to help even an Aſs labouring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Burden,</hi> Exod. 23.5. And can you omit bearing with Miniſters, and ſtriving with them?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Succeſs of the Miniſtry depends very much upon the joint Endeavours of Miniſters and People to promote it.</hi> What can either Miniſters or People do alone? If Miniſters are zealous &amp; laborious in their Work; yet if a People remain careleſs &amp; ſlothful, they will have Reaſon to complain they labour in vain: So, if a People are ſtriving in Prayer, and Miniſters are void of Life, there will be but little Fruit: But when they both unite their Endeavours <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Prayers, there is a Proſpect of a glorious Harveſt.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:004883_0021_100E08D2B99418D8"/>4. <hi>The Conſideration that Miniſters are employed to advance the Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ought to invigorate Miniſters and People to uſe their beſt Endeavours to promote the Miniſtry.</hi> If we have any Love to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who has loved us to the Death, ſhall we not ſeek the Advancement of his Kingdom of Peace in the World? His Government is moſt happy &amp; reaſonable: his Laws all juſt and good. And ſhall we not ſeek to promote ſuch a Kingdom in the World? Which the more it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails, the more happy it will make Men; for <hi>his Yoke is eaſy, and his Burden light,</hi> Mat. 11.29, 30.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Have Miniſters and People any Love to the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, they will thus ſtrive together.</hi> If they have any Deſire to feel the bleſſed Influences of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God upon their own Hearts; or do they long to ſee the bleſſed Fruits and Effects of it upon the Souls of others, they will ſtrive together herefor: The more faithful and labourious Miniſters are, and the more a People ſtrive to profit, ſo much the more is the good Spirit of God cheriſhed amongſt a People: But if Miniſters are unfaithful, and a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple careleſs and ſlothful, they will quench the Spirit of God, and drive him from them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The preſent Circumſtances of Religion in the Country require the moſt vigorous Endeavours of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and People to ſupport the ſame.</hi> God has been pleaſed remarkably to revive his Work in our Land: But by Reaſon of the Imprudence and over-heated Zeal of one Set of Men; and the Coldneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference of another towards Religion; it is dying in many Parts of the Land: and we are in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Danger of falling into the wildeſt Confuſion in our religious Affairs. Some are haſtening on the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004883_0022_100DEF48C2B177E8"/>
greateſt Extravagance in Religion, and others grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a Coldneſs and Contempt of the Work of God. And is it not now high Time for Miniſters and People to uſe their beſt Endeavours to guard Religion, and ſave themſelves from theſe approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Calamities?</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Both Miniſters and People are accountable to Chriſt their Judge for what they do. We muſt all ſtand before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 14.10. And <hi>muſt give an Account of our ſelves,</hi> Ver. 12. Miniſters for what they have preached, and you for what you have heard, and how you have profited by it: And what Account can we give, if we have not done our Endeavours to advance the Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt? If Miniſters are not faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to diſcharge their Truſt, and a People don't take Care to profit under their Miniſtry, how amazing will their Account be?</p>
            <p>What remains is to apply what has been ſaid to Miniſters and People.</p>
            <p>USE I. Of Information. <hi>And what you have heard ſhews you how falſly they judge of Things, who envy Miniſters their Work becauſe it is attended with greater Eaſe than other Employments.</hi> They know not what Trials and Sorrows they are exerciſed with, who attend upon the Miniſtry: While you eat and ſleep ſweetly, Miniſters feed upon the Bread of Tears, and Sleep flies from them: They have Agonies and Struggles which the World know not of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So alſo what has been ſaid ſhows us what Reaſon both Miniſters and People have for Humiliation and Self-Abaſement:</hi> We have all done too little for Chriſt: Have not ſtrove together as we ought to
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004883_0023_100E08D72C6BD380"/>
have done; the beſt and moſt faithful Miniſters have Reaſon to be aſhamed they have ſtrove no more to advance the Kingdom of Chriſt, and the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Souls, and may juſtly ſay, <hi>they have been unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Servants,</hi> Luk. 17.10. And that People who have ſtrove moſt to advance the Kingdom of Chriſt, and the Salvation of their Souls, may juſtly ſay, <hi>in many Things we have offended all,</hi> Jam. 3.2.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We may alſo, from what has been ſaid, account for it that the Miniſtry is attended with no better Succeſs.</hi> Miniſters and People don't ſtrive together, and are not ſuitably concerned to promote Religion; would they ſtir up themſelves and put their Hands to the Work, would not a merciful God do for them what they can't do themſelves?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We alſo learn from what has been ſaid it ſhould be Matter of great rejoycing, when God pours out his Spirit, to both Miniſters &amp; People, for now Miniſters may expect much Succeſs in their Work, and a People hope for the Salvation of Souls.</hi> So on the other Hand, how ſhould they mourn when God takes away his Spirit from them; for then Miniſters will labour very much in vain; and a People will grow cold, and draw back in Religion.</p>
            <p>USE. II. Of Direction to Miniſters and People. Would they mutually ſtrive together:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Let both Miniſters and People endeavour to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain juſt Thoughts of one another.</hi> It has too often happened, becauſe Miniſters and a People have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained wrong Thoughts of each other, in a little Time they have fallen into a ſhameful coldneſs and indifferency towards each other: Thus a People ſometimes when they call a Miniſter among them,
<pb n="22"
                   facs="unknown:004883_0024_100E08DA0C648028"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
exalt him above Meaſure; and ſcarcely will allow humane Frailties in him: <hi>but this is only to prepare him for the greater Fall:</hi> Like a Pendulum, the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it is ſtretched on one ſide; will in its return ſwing as far on the oppoſite Side. And even ſuch a People are commonly as ready to debaſe him as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to exalt him. Let a People therefore look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Miniſter as a Man of the ſame Paſſions and Infirmities with themſelves; and expect he will fail in ſome Things as well as they.</p>
            <p>So let a Miniſter look upon his People as Men who have many Remainders of Corruption, from whom he muſt expect to receive Injuries and Abuſes. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters have ſometimes been ready to look upon their People wholly free from theſe Things, and when they have evilly intreated them, have been ready to ſink under it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let Miniſters and People take pains to grow and increaſe in their Love for one another; and then they will ſtrive together; and will not oppoſe one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Miniſters muſt love their People, as their ſpecial Charge, whoſe Souls they are accountable for. And if they periſh thro' their Neglect, they <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> anſwer for them to God. And let a People look upon their Miniſters as ſpecial Bleſſings beſtowed by Chriſt the great Head of the Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. and a People ought to love them in a high Degree as ſuch.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Would Miniſters and People ſtrive together, let them learn to bear with and cover over one another's Failings.</hi> A Miniſter muſt be very ſparing in ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abroad the Weakneſs or Sins of his People: and a People muſt always conceal as much as
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004883_0025_100E08DB92B84068"/>
poſſible the Infirmities of their Miniſters, Let not the Failings of Miniſters be the Subject of your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and the News you carry abroad with you. A want of this mutual bearing between Miniſters and People, has greatly hindred the Miniſtry and the Salvation of Souls.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Let Miniſters and People make the Advancement of Religion their great Buſineſs.</hi> Both Miniſters and People are too cold in the Service of Chriſt, by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of their being too much engaged in worldly Affairs. A People think hard to ſupport the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, and do much to promote it; becauſe they are more concerned to promote ſomething elſe. Now if the Advancement of Chriſt's Kingdom lies neareſt the Hearts of Miniſters and People, they will ſtrive together.</p>
            <p>USE. III. Of Motive to Miniſters and People to ſtrive together. And</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Let us all conſider how much the Lord Jeſus Chriſt has done for us.</hi> He freely undertook for our Redemption; left the Glories of Heaven, came down and dwelt in Fleſh: <hi>He who was rich emptied himſelf and became poor, that we might be made rich,</hi> 2 Cor. 8.9. He obeyed the Law which we had broke; and has paid the Debt we owed to divine Juſtice. He ſuffered the ſhameful and cruel Death of the Croſs; and is aſcended into Heaven, there to make Interceſſion for Sinners: And now, can we be unwilling to do all we can for Chriſt, who has done ſo much for us?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Let Miniſters and People conſider how awful it will be to periſh after they have lived under the Goſpel, the one preaching and the other hearing the glad Tidings
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004883_0026_100E08DDA2D38318"/>
of Salvation.</hi> Barely preaching the Word of God, or hearing the Goſpel preached, will not intitle Men to Salvation; and many who now preach, and hear the Goſpel preached, will another Day hear Chriſt ſay to them, <hi>I know you not,</hi> Mat. 7.22, 23. Luk. 13.25. But can Miniſters or People bear the Tho'ts of being thus diſowned by Chriſt?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Often think what Joy and Satisfaction it will yield you in the great Day of Accounts to be found to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at the right Hand of Chriſt.</hi> What Pleaſure will it be to Miniſters to ſee in that Day great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their People, whom they travailled in Birth for, ſtanding with them at the right Hand of Chriſt cloathed in white Raiment. This will afford mutual and inexpreſſible Joy to Miniſters and People.</p>
            <p>To conclude, <hi>Let us all keep in View the Glories of the upper World, and that unſpeakable Reward which will be given both to Miniſters and People who are faithful and ſtrive together to promote the Kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Eye has not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor can it enter into our Hearts to conceive of the great Things God has prepared for ſuch,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.9. And both Miniſters and People who ſtrive together to promote the Kingdom of Chriſt; and are made the happy Inſtruments of recovering Souls from Sin to God, will <hi>ſhine as the Brightneſs of the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and as the Stars for ever and ever.</hi>

            <head>The CHARGE given the Rev. Mr. <hi>John Norton.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHEN our bleſſed Lord aſcended up on high, he gave Gifts to Men; and this was one of the precious Gifts of our aſcended Redeemer, even a ſettled Miniſtry, an Order of Men ſeperated and ordained to the Office and Work of the Goſpel Miniſtry, to teach and inſtruct Men in the Way of Salvation: And God having in his wiſe Providence inclined the Hearts of this People, to call you to this great and good Work among them; and your's alſo to accept their Invitation: We the Elders and Meſſengers now preſent, being ſatisfied of your Gifts and Qualifications therefor, do now heartily join together to ſeperate and ordain you to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Miniſtry, according to Chriſt's Appointment, and particularly a Paſtor over this Church, whoſe Call you have now accepted: And we give thee Charge in the Sight of God, and before our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the Quick and the Dead, at his Appearing and Kingdom, to take the Overſight thereof, not for filthy Lucre ſake; but of a ready Mind. And we truſt the great Lord of the Harveſt will be with you; who calls you to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in his Vineyard, and make you an able, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and ſucceſsful Miniſter of the New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>And we ſolemnly Charge you before God, to preach the Word; be inſtant in Seaſon, and out of Seaſon: Reprove, Rebuke, Exhort, with all Long-ſuffering and Doctrine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:004883_0028_100E08E2159AE628"/>Take Care to ſhew thy ſelf approved, a Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man that needeth not to be aſhamed, rightly divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word of Truth; and give to every one his Portion in due Seaſon.</p>
            <p>Give Attendance to Reading, to Exhortation, to Doctrine; holding faſt the faithful Word as thou haſt been taught, according the Scriptures of Truth; that thou mayſt be able both to exhort and convince Gainſayers.</p>
            <p>Take care alſo to inſtruct the ignorant, convince the erroneous; contend earneſtly for the Faith once delivered to the Saints: You muſt rebuke the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate, and comfort the feeble minded.</p>
            <p>Make full Proof of thy Miniſtry: Meditate upon theſe Things; give thy ſelf wholly to them; that thy profiting may appear to all Men.</p>
            <p>Take heed to thy Self, and thy Doctrine; that thou mayeſt both ſave thy ſelf, and them that hear thee.</p>
            <p>You muſt pray for this People both in publick and private; and be their daily Interceſſor at the Throne of Grace.</p>
            <p>Do thou alſo now receive Authority to adminiſter the Sacraments, and Seals of the New Teſtament, to Perſons ſuitably qualified: taking Care always to diſtinguiſh between the precious and the vile; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring that Holineſs becomes God's Houſe for ever.</p>
            <p>Unto thee are now committed the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, the Key of Doctrine, and the Key of Diſcipline; them that Sin rebuke before all.</p>
            <p>And we now ſolemnly Charge thee before the great GOD, the LORD JESUS CHRIST, and the elect

Angels, that thou obſerve theſe Things without preferring one before another; doing nothing by Partiality: keep thy ſelf pure.</p>
            <p>Let no Man deſpiſe thee; but be thou an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the Believers, in Word, in Converſation, in Charity, in Spirit, in Faith, in Purity.</p>
            <p>Conſider alſo that a Biſhop muſt be blameleſs, and the Servant of the Lord muſt not ſtrive, but be gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle towards all Men.</p>
            <p>He muſt be patient, in Meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, if peradventure God may give them Repentance to the acknowledgement of the Truth.</p>
            <p>Carefully thus feed the Flock of CHRIST now committed to your Charge; not as being a Lord over God's Heritage, but as being an Example to the Flock: And when our bleſſed LORD the great Shepherd ſhall appear, you ſhall receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away.</p>
