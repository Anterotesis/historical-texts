         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>CHAP. I. </head>
               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Negro ſlavery totally inconſiſtent with the principles of revealed religion and natural juſtice.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>I CONCEIVE that it would become every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate of Chriſtianity to teſtify againſt a cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom which is now practiſed by a great part of Chriſtendom. I mean the cuſtom of enſlaving the Africans. It is ſaid in the goſpel, "thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf." It would be vain to plead that a Negro is not the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of a white man, and that a difference of complexion will alter the neceſſity of obeying the command of our Saviour. To plead this would be an affront to reaſon, as well as a direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to the expreſs declaration of chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,—For the ſame revelation which ſays, "Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour as thyſelf," ſays, that GOD "hath made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth."
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:022434_0004_0FB87CBFFA345460"/>The words here are as comprehenſive and as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible as any words can be to prove that men of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very color and appearance, that Negroes, as well as the reſt of mankind, ſhould be conſidered as their neighbours by the diſciples of Chriſt. It is firſt ſaid that GOD hath made of <hi>one blood, all</hi> nations of men, and then again it is ſaid that theſe of <hi>one</hi> blood are to dwell on <hi>all</hi> the face of the earth. When therefore it can be proved that <hi>one</hi> blood ſignifies <hi>various</hi> bloods, that <hi>all</hi> nations ſignif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>y <hi>ſome</hi> nations, and that <hi>all the face</hi> of the earth ſignifies only <hi>a part</hi> of the earth, then it may be proved that thoſe who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians, are not culpable in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards the oppreſſed Africans. St. Paul ſays, that the goſpel was deſigned to give free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to all mankind. "Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumciſion nor uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free, but Chriſt is all, and in all." Coloſians iii. 11. In ſhort, we may apply to ſome of the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of this unhappy race of men, who perhaps may conceive from their color that they are of an inferior ſpecies, and that they may be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed without guilt, what this Apoſtle ſays in another place, we may ſay of them, that GOD hath ſent them "ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould believe a lie: that they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022434_0005_0FB87CC182263778"/>pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs." II. Theſſalonians ii. 11 and 12. For have not Negroes the ſame figure, the ſame voice, the ſame paſſions, and the ſame feelings, with white men? Were they not made by the ſame GOD, and are they not redeemed by the ſame Saviour? Can it be any ſignification in the eye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of the Supreme, who the Apoſtle tells us "is no reſpecter of perſons," whether we are brown, or black, or white?— In the Old Teſtament the Prophets frequently denounce the heavieſt judgements upon the Jews for keeping their brethren in ſlavery. The cauſe of freedom is mentioned as the cauſe of GOD in the Bible. Jeremiah ſays that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Jeruſalem made a covenant with King Hezekiah, that they ſhould proclaim liberty un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their ſervants. And afterwards he repreſents the Almighty as declaring, "But ye turned and polluted my name, and cauſed every man his ſervant, and every man his hand-maid, whom he had ſet at liberty at their pleaſure, to return, and brought them into ſubjection, to be unto you for ſervants and for hand-maids:—There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, thus ſaith the Lord, ye have not hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me in proclaiming liberty every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbour; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I proclaim a liberty for you, ſaith the Lord, to the ſword, to the peſtilence, and to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and I will make you to be removed into
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:022434_0006_0FB87CC3C2849F70"/>all the kingdoms of the earth." Jeremiah xxxiv. 16 and 17. Theſe ſevere afflictions were to be the conſequence of unjuſtly keeping others in a ſtate of ſervitude much milder than that with which the Negroes are oppreſſed. The making others work without payment, which is but a trivial part of the oppreſſion of the Negroes, was eſteemed by the Jewiſh Prophets a crime of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable magnitude. Jeremiah ſays, "Wo unto him that buildeth his houſe by unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and his chambers by wrong; that uſeth his neighbour's ſervice without wages, and giveth him not for his work: That ſaith I will build me a wide houſe and large chambers, and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth him out windows, and it is ceiled with cedar, and painted with vermilion. Shalt thou reign becauſe thou cloſeſt thyſelf with cedar? Did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgement and juſtice, and then it was well with him? He judged the cauſe of the poor and needy, then it was well with him: Was not this to know me? ſaith the Lord. But thine eyes and thine heart are not but for thy covetouſneſs, and for to ſhed innocent blood, and for oppreſſion, and for violence to do it. Therefore, thus ſaith the Lord concerning Jehoiakim, the ſon of Joſiah, King of Judah, They ſhall not lament for him, ſaying, Ah my brother! or, Ah ſiſter! They ſhall not lament for him, ſaying, Ah Lord! or
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:022434_0007_0FB87CC64FBE55A0"/>Ah his glory! He ſhall be buried <hi>(attend ye tyrants!)</hi> with the burial of an aſs, drawn and caſt forth beyond the gates of Jeruſalem." chap. xxii. verſes 13—19. The ſlavery with which the Negroes in various parts of the Weſt Indies, and in the ſouthern ſtates of America, and with which the peaſants in Poland, and ſome other countries, are afflicted, is not only oppoſed by the principles of religion, but of reaſon and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. It is well ſaid by Dr. Blackſtone, "I have formerly obſerved that pure and proper ſlavery does not, nay cannot, ſubſiſt in England; ſuch I mean, whereby an unlimited power is given to the maſter over the life and fortune of the ſlave. And indeed it is repugnant to reaſon and the principles of natural law, that ſuch a ſtate ſhould ſubſiſt any where. The three origins of the right of ſlavery, aſſigned by Juſtinian

                     </gap>cillis noſtris. Inſt. I.</note>, are all of them built upon falſe foundations. As firſt ſlavery is held to be "Jure Gentium" from a ſtate of captivity in war; whence ſlaves are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mancipia, quaſi Manu capti. The conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, ſay the Civilians, had a right to the life of his captive, and having ſpared that, has a right to deal with him as he pleaſes. But it is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true poſition, when taken generally, that by the law of nature or nations, a man may kill his
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022434_0008_0FB87CC77A93ED08"/>enemy; he has only a right to kill him in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſes; in caſes of abſolute neceſſity for ſelf-defence; and it is plain this abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity did not ſubſiſt, ſince the victor did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually kill him, but made him priſoner. War itſelf is juſtifiable only on principles of ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; and therefore it gives no other right over priſoners, but merely to diſable them from doing harm to us, by confining their perſons; much leſs can it give a right to kill, torture, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe, plunder, or even to enſlave an enemy, when the war is over. Since, therefore, the right of <hi>making</hi> ſlaves, by captivity, depends on a ſuppoſed right of ſlaughter, that foundation failing, the conſequence drawn from it muſt fail likewiſe. But ſecondly, it is ſaid that ſlavery may begin "jure civili;" when one man ſells himſelf to another. This, if only meant of contracts to ſerve or work for another, is very juſt; but when applied to ſtrict ſlavery, in the ſenſe of the laws of old Rome, or modern Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bary, is alſo impoſſible. Every ſale implies a price, a quid pro quo, an equivalent given to the ſeller in lieu of what he transfers to the buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: But what equivalent can be given for life and liberty, both of which (in abſolute ſlavery) are held to be at the maſter's diſpoſal. His pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty alſo, the very price he ſeems to receive, devolves ipſo facto to his Maſter, the inſtant he
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:022434_0009_0FB87CC9C011CAB0"/>becomes his ſlave. In this caſe, therefore, the buyer gives nothing, and the ſeller receives no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: Of what validity then can a ſale be, which deſtroys the very principles upon which all ſales are founded? Laſtly, we are told that beſides theſe two ways by which ſlaves "fiunt," or are acquired, they may alſo be hereditary: "Servi naſcuntur," the children of acquired ſlaves, are jure naturae, by a negative kind of birth right, ſlaves alſo. But this being built on the two former rights, muſt fall together with them. If neither captivity, nor the ſale of one's ſelf, can, by the law of nature and reaſon, reduce the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to ſlavery, much leſs can they reduce the offspring."

               <p>AS many have been apt to pretend that the Negroes are inferior to the white people on account of their color, it may ſerve the cauſe of humanity to prove this color to be the effect of climate. It has been ſaid that the Negroes are the deſcendants of Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A little attention to ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, however, will convince us of the abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of this opinion: for we there find that all who are upon earth are the deſcendants of Noah and his family <hi>only.</hi> The Apoſtle moſt certainly ſays the truth when he ſays that GOD "hath made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth." If we exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:022434_0011_0FB87CCE443875A8"/>the matter with due care we ſhall alſo find that true Philoſophy will tell us the ſame as the ſcripture. It will tell us that the Negro is in every reſpect ſimilar to us, only that his ſkin, or rather the ſkin of his anceſtors, has been darkened by the ſun. If we attend to ourſelves we ſhall find that the part of our bodies which is expoſed is of a very different color from that which is covered. If we take a piece of bread and put it to the fire for a little time it will be brown, but if it is continued there long it will be black. In the ſame manner it is the nature of the ſun firſt to embrown, and then to blacken the ſkin. I myſelf knew a gentleman in the Weſt-Indies, who from his engagements for a conſiderable part of his life uſed to be almoſt daily expoſed to the ſun, which made him ſo brown that he was proverbially called Mulatto Frank. The lower part of his face had as much of the Negro tinge in it as the face of a mulatto, of a perſon born from a white and black parent. And he, I very well knew, was deſcended from Engliſh parents, who had not the leaſt Negro blood in them. It has been obſerved that if the black ſkin and the frizzled head of the Negroes proceeded from the heat of the ſun, we ſhould find people of a ſimilar appearance in the ſame parallels of latitude with Africa. This is a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of which we have ſufficient evidence.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:022434_0012_0FB87CD078BE3AD8"/>In Captain Carteret's account of his voyage round the world, in the years 1766, 1767, 1768, and 1769, he ſays, "In the night of Monday the 24th, we fell in with nine iſlands; they ſtretch nearly N. W. by W. and S. E. by E. about 15 leagues, and lie, in latitude 4° 36′ S. longitude 154° 17′ E. according to the ſhip's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. I imagine theſe to be the iſlands which are called Ohang <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>aya, and were diſcovered by Taſman; for the ſituation anſwers very nearly to their place in the French Chart, which, in the year 1756, was corrected for the King's ſhips. The other iſlands Carteret's, Gower's, and Simpſon's, I believe had never been ſeen by an European navigator before. There is certainly much land in this part of the ocean not yet known. One of theſe iſlands is of conſiderable extent, the other eight are ſcarcely better than large rocks, but though they are low and flat, they are well covered with wood and abound with inhabitants. The people are black and woolly-headed like the Negroes of Africa: their weapons are bows and arrows; and they have large canoes which they navigate with a fail, one of which came near us, but they would not venture on board." Hawkeſworth's voyages, vol. 1 pages 586 and 587, quarto edition Captain Carteret ſays alſo of New-Ireland (which is nearly in the ſame latitude) that "the people
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:022434_0013_0FB87CD1F7CAAF30"/>are black and woolly-headed like the Negroes, but have not the flat noſe and thick lips; and we thought them much the ſame people as the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Egmont's-Iſland: like them they were all ſtark naked, except a few ornaments made of ſhells upon their arms and legs. They had, however, adopted a practice without which none of our belles and beaus are ſuppoſed to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely dreſt, for the hair, or rather the wool, upon their heads, was very abundantly powdered with white powder." Page 599.—Buffon, in his eſſay on the varieties of the human ſpecies, ſays "to the ſouth of the Mariana Iſlands, and eaſtward of the Moluccas, we find the land of the Papous and New-Guinea, which ſeem to be the moſt ſoutherly regions of the globe. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Argenſola, the Papous are as black as the Caffres, have criſped hair, and a meagre diſagreeable viſage." Vol. 3, page 92—In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place he ſays, "the Papous and other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions adjacent to New-Guinea, are real Negroes, and reſemble thoſe of Africa; though they are feparated from the continent, by a tract of ſea more than 2200 leagues over. The natives of New-Holland have a ſtrong analogy to the Hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentots." Page 96—Dampier (according to Buffon) ſpeaking of an iſland in New-Guinea, called Garret Denys, ſays, "that the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants are black, robuſt, and well made, that they
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:022434_0014_0FB87CD4F933A188"/>have large round heads, and ſhort, criſped hair, which they cut in different faſhions, and paint with various colors, as red, white, and yellow." See Dampier, vol. 5, page 102. If we caſt our eyes over a globe or a map of the world, we ſhall find all theſe places to be in the ſame parallel of latitude with Africa. Buffon ſays, in his above mentioned eſſay, that "the natives of the coaſt of New-Holland, which is ſituated in the 16th degree of ſouth latitude and beyond the iſland of Timor, are perhaps the moſt miſerable of the human ſpecies. They have no beard, and their viſage is long without a feature that is agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; their hair is ſhort, black and criſped, and their ſkin is as black as that of the Guinea Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes." He refers to Dampier, vol. 2, page 171. In "A Journal of a voyage round the World," made by Capt. Cook, in his Majeſty's ſhip the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor, in the years 1768, 1769, 1770, 1771, it is ſaid, ſpeaking of the inhabitants of New-Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in latitude 36° 21′ S. and longitude 150° 18′ E. variation 10° 42′ E. "the inhabitants were entirely naked and black, but they differed from the Negroes of Africa in having long ſtrait hair, inſtead of wool upon their heads." Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fon ſpeaks of the inhabitants in the 16th degree of latitude, and Captain Cook of thoſe in the 36th, which may account for the difference in their hair, which is not ſo ſoon made criſped by the ſun as the ſkin is darkened.</p>

                  <pb n="17" facs="unknown:022434_0015_0FB87CD678F5B210"/>
It has been objected that if color were the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of climate, many of the inhabitants of South America would be black. There are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral reaſons why the ſame parallel of latitude in South America, may not be as hot as that in Africa. There are very high mountains in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts of South America, which, with exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive marſhes, may there render the air cooler than in many parts of Africa, where they have no mountains and a ſandy ſoil. South America, however, is not without people who are black, and in Africa may be found ſome who are of a copper or an olive complexion. Buffon, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of South-America, ſays, "Some voyagers mention a nation in Guiana, of which the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are blacker than any other Indians. The Arras, ſays Raleigh, are nearly as black as the Negroes, are extremely ſtrong, and uſe poiſoned arrows." Eſſay on the Varieties of the Human Species, vol. 3, page 183.</p>
               <p>It may be obſerved by ſome that the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of New-Guinea and other places, who are black and have frizzled hair, are the deſcendants of emigrants from Africa. This appears, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to be an obſervation totally unſupported by reaſon. New-Guinea and theſe places are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant more than 6000 miles from Africa. We have no record in hiſtory, whatever, to make us ſuppoſe that ſuch an emigration was ever prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:022434_0016_0FB87CD7F80483E0"/>and indeed it is difficult to ſuppoſe how it could be practiſed.</p>
               <p>It is moſt certain that if a white people were to emigrate to Africa, they would in the courſe of time become black, and have the woolly head of the Negroes. Job Ludolphus, in his "Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Fthiopia or the Kingdom of Abeſſinia," ſays, "I am now about to write the Hiſtory of the Abeſſines, concerning whom there have been many large but few true relations. For theſe people having tranſplanted themſelves from the maritime regions of the Arabian Guif, into the more upland parts of Africa, &amp;c." Page 1. And in another place he ſays, "The Abeſſines are generally black which they moſt admire." Page 71. The Arabians are ſwarthy, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, but they became generally black in the courſe of a very few centuries from the heat of Africa. In Aftley's collection of voyages, it is mentioned, that, in the beginning of the 15th century, ſome Portugueſe ſettled in Africa, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with the natives, and that their deſcendants have now a black ſkin and woolly head ſimilar to other Negroes. On the other hand, if the Africans were to emigrate to colder climates their deſcendants would in the courſe of time become white, and have long ſilky hair. It is a well known fact that the deſcendants of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes in America become every generation

If we were able to prove, however, for which we cannot produce any thing like an argument, the Hypotheſis that color is not the effect of climate in regard to the human ſpecies, and that the Almighty originally made ſome men white and ſome black as he made horſes, yet this ſhould not induce us to treat the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes otherwiſe than as our Brethren. For a black man, as well as a black horſe, may have all the good properties of a white one. We are told by the Prophet that the Almighty does not conſider us with affection from being white or black, from having long or frizzled hair, but he repreſents him ſaying, "The Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my foot-ſtool, but to this man will I look who is of an humble and contrite ſpirit, and who trembleth at my word."</p>

               <p>IT is an aſſertion of Mr. David Hume, in his Eſſay on National Characters, that "there never aroſe a man of genius among Negroes." This aſſertion is attacked, as well as many other abſurd and dangerous principles of Mr Hume, with great propriety, by the celebrated Dr. Beattie, in his Eſſay on the Nature and Immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Truth. There are two diſadvantages againſt the improvement of their talents, under which the negroes labor, from which the white people are free. They are enſlaved, and they want opportunity. Slavery depreſſes the mind, and prevents it from expanding its faculties. It has the effect which the Latin Poet aſcribes to intemperance.</p>

               <p>The late Anthony Benezet of Philadelphia, ſeems to have been as well qualified as almoſt any man, to judge of the difference between the natural genius of the Negroes and the white people. He originally kept a ſchool for be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of white children, and afterwards for
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:022434_0019_0FB87CDC784DA688"/>the inſtruction of the blacks. He ſays in a little pamphlet which he publiſhed, that "he, as teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of a ſchool eſtabliſhed by private ſubſcription in Philadelphia, for the inſtruction of the black children and others of that people, has for many years had opportunity of knowing the temper and the genius of the Africans, particularly of thoſe under his tuition, who have been many of different ages; and he can with truth and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity declare, that he has found amongſt them as great a variety of talents, equally capable of improvement, as amongſt a like number of whites; and he is bold to aſſert, that the notion entertained by ſome, that the blacks are inferior to the whites in their capacities, is a vulgar pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, founded on the pride orignorance of their lordly maſters, who have kept their ſlaves at ſuch a diſtance, as to be unable to form a right judgement of them."</p>
               <p>Ignatius Sancho may be produced as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of genius among Negroes under great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages.

                     <p>IT would be an inſult to your humanity (or perhaps look like it) to apologize for the liberty I am taking.— I am one of thoſe people whom the vulgar and illiberal call "Negurs." The firſt part of my life was rather un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky, as I was placed in a family who judged ignorance the beſt and only ſecurity for obedience. A little reading and writing I got by unwearried application. The latter part of my life, has been, through GOD's bleſſing, truly fortunate, having ſpent it in the ſervice of the beſt of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies in the kingdom. My chief pleaſure has been books —Philanthropy I adore. How very much, good Sir, am I (amongſt millions) indebted to you for the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of your amiable Uncle Toby! I declare I would walk ten miles in the dog-days to ſhake hands with the honeſt Corporal. Your Sermons have touched me to the heart, and I hope have amended it, which brings me to the point. In your tenth diſcourſe, page 78, in the ſecond volume, is this very affecting paſſage: "Conſider how great a part of our ſpecies, in all ages down to this, have been trod under the feet of cruel and capricious tyrants; who would neither hear their cries, nor pity th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Of all my favorite authors not one has drawn a tear in favor of my miſerable black brethren, excepting yourſelf and the humane author of Sir George Elliſon. I think you will forgive me—I am ſure you will applaud me for beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you to give half an hour's attention to ſlaver<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Dear Sir, think in me you behold the uplifted hands of thouſands of my brother Moors. Grief (you pathetically obſerve) is eloquent; figure to yourſelf their attitudes! hear their ſupplicating addreſſes! Alas! you cannot refuſe.

               <p>We read of a Negro in ſcripture who muſt have been a man of genius and learning, as well as in an elevated ſtation. We are told (Acts, chap. 8.) that he was of great authority under Candace, Queen of the Ethiopians, and that he was entruſted with all her treaſure It is ſaid that he was ſitting in his chariot, and was read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Prophet Iſaiah (probably in Hebrew) when Philip the Apoſtle was led by the ſpirit to interpret the Prophet to him, and to finiſh his character by making him a Chriſtian It is ſaid that Job Ben Solomon, a native of Africa, who was brought to the acquaintance of Sir Hans Sloane, was by him known to be a complete maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Arabian tongue, by his tranſlating ſeveral manuſcripts and inſcriptions upon me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals. He was thought to be a man of very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary talents. There is a long account of him by Bluet and Moore, in Aſtley's Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, vol. 2. The celebrated James Ramſay in a pamphlet of his called, "An Enquiry into the effects of putting a ſtop to the African Slave

Niebuhr) originally publiſhed in German, and ſince tranſlated into French in three volumes, 4to. Farhan, a jet black Negro, was carried a boy into Arabia, and there ſold to an officer in the Court of Imam or Prince of Yemen. His maſter gave him eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry advantage of education, and entruſted him, as he grew up, in the management of his affairs. Theſe he conducted with ſo much propriety and addreſs as to attract the notice of the Prince, who took him near his perſon, and afterwards made him Governor of Loheia, a city on the ſea coaſt. There our travellers found him, ruling his people, as a kind father would his children. To theſe travellers he behaved with the utmoſt kindneſs, generoſity, and even polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, expreſſed the greateſt fondneſs for their converſation, and a warm deſire to learn, and be informed, of whatever was ſtriking in Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans. In ſhort, they, when ſpeaking of him, call him the good Farhan, and had many ſad opportunities of contraſting his behavior with the other native Arabian Governors. Here then we have an African towering above the

It is ignorant pride that fancies a diſtinction." It is ſaid in Dodſley's Annual Regiſter for 1786, vol. 28, page 177— "The Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, this year, elected, as one of their foreign correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, a Mr. Liſtel, a free black, of the Iſle of France, who had diſtinguiſhed himſelf by a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of curious and extremely well calculated me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teorological obſervations; thus breaking down in ſome degree the ſtrong and long eſtabliſhed line of diſtinction between colors, and holding out encouragement to future Africans to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the ſciences and philoſophy, by ſhewing them that the way is opened to academical ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, wherever they are merited, without any regard to the country or natural hue of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious proficient."</p>
               <p>Dr. James Derham, a Negro, who is now living, may be produced as an inſtance of genius.

They are made in the Weſt-Indies, with little inſtruction, excellent carpenters, coopers, and maſons. They very commonly know the art of making ſugar, and ſome the more difficult ſcience of diſtilling rum. Some of them are expert ſwimmers and fiſhermen. They have an eye, like a lynx, to detect their prey. I have been delighted when in the boat with them, to ſee them dive to the bottom of the ſea, and ſtrike the ſea hedge-hog or other things, with an iron inſtrument formed for that purpoſe.— Some of them have been known, in this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and when thus armed, to fight a ſhark, and beat him off.

They are ſeldom troubled with war: If a difference happen between two nations, they commonly end the diſpute amicably.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants of the Gold and Slave coaſt likewiſe, when they are not artfully incenſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt each other, live in great union and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, being generally well tempered, civil, tract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and ready to help any that need it. In
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:022434_0031_0FB87CF2F7E8A710"/>particular the natives of the kingdom of Whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, are civil, kind, and obliging to ſtrangers. And they are the moſt gentleman-like of all the negroes, abounding in good manners towards each other. The inferiors pay great reſpect to their ſuperiors: So wives to their huſbands, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to their parents. And they are remarkably induſtrious: all are conſtantly employed; the men in agriculture, the women in ſpinning and weaving cotton.</p>
               <p>The Gold and Slave Coaſts are divided into ſeveral diſtricts, ſome governed by kings, others by the principal men, who take care each of their own town or village, and prevent or appeaſe tumults. They puniſh murder and adultery ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely; very frequently with death. Theft and robbery are puniſhed by a fine proportionable to the goods that were taken. All the natives of this coaſt, though Heathens, believe there is one GOD, the author of them and all things.— They appear likewiſe to have a confuſed appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of a future ſtate.

                  </gap> is remarkable that they have no beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars among them: Such is the care of the chief men in every city and village, to provide ſome eaſy labor, even for the old and weak. Some are employed in blowing the ſmith's bellows;
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:022434_0032_0FB87CF47721EFF8"/>others in preſſing palm-oil; others in grinding colors. If they are too weak even for this, they ſell proviſions in the market.</p>
               <p>The account we have of the natives of the kingdom of Benin is, that they are a reaſonable and a good-natured people, ſincere and inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>five, and do no injuſtice either to one another or to ſtrangers. They are civil and courteous: If you make them a preſent, they endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay it double.

If a man and woman of any quality, are taken in adultery, they are certain to be put to death, and their bodies thrown upon a dung-hill, and left a prey to wild beaſts. They are punctually juſt and honeſt in their dealings; and are alſo very charitable. The king and the great lords taking care to employ all that are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any work. And thoſe that are utterly helpleſs they keep for God's ſake; ſo that here alſo are no beggars.</p>

               <p>Some may think that the virtues of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes are too highly extolled in this account of
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:022434_0034_0FB87CF999CA14D0"/>them; but I think that every impartial and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent perſon will agree with me that, with the ſame advantages, there is as great likelihood of finding virtue in a Negro as in a white man. Mr. Ramſay, however, in his Eſſay on the Treatment and Converſation of African Slaves in the Britiſh Sugar Colonies, page 262, gives an extract of a letter from a humane, intelligent ſea officer, in which it is ſaid—"The Negroes along the ſea-coaſt of Africa, (particularly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the French) are well-informed, eaſy, kind, generous, and have a better ſenſe of right and wrong than any other people I ever viſited.

And again he ſays—"Which way ſoever I turned my eyes on this pleaſant ſpot, I beheld a perfect image of pure nature, an agreeable ſolitude, bounded on every ſide by a charming landſcape. The rural ſituation of cottages in the midſt of trees; the eaſe and indolence of the Negroes, reclined un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhade of their ſpreading foliage; the ſimplicity of their dreſs and manners; the whole revived in my mind the idea of our firſt parents, and I ſeemed to contemplate the world in its pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive ſtate." Page 54. Abbe Raynal gives us a fine inſtance of heroic virtue in a Negro. He ſays, "In America it is generally believed and aſſerted that the Africans are equally incapable of reaſon and virtue. The following well-authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated fact will enable us to judge of this opinion.</p>
               <p>An Engliſh ſhip that traded in Guinea, in 1752, was obliged to leave the ſurgeon behind, whoſe bad ſtate of health did not permit him to continue at ſea.

This diſcourſe appeaſed the rage of the blacks: they retired aſhamed of the deſign that had brought them there, and ſome days after acknowledged to Murray himſelf how happy they were they had not committed a crime which would have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned them perpetual remorſe." Juſtamond's tranſlation of Abbe Raynal's hiſtory, vol. III, page 440. Mr. Ramſay in his Eſſay on the Treatment and Converſion of African Slaves in
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:022434_0037_0FB87CFE384AF320"/>the Britiſh Sugar Colonies, gives the following noble inſtance of gratitude in a Negro. "Joſeph Rachel was a black trader in Barbadoes; he dealt chiefly in the retail way, and was ſo fair and complaiſant in buſineſs, that in a town filled with little peddling ſhops, his doors were throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with cuſtomers. I have often dealt with him, and found him remarkably honeſt and obliging. If any one knew not where to procure an article Joſeph would be at pains to ſearch it out, to ſupply him, without making an advantage of it. In ſhort, his character was ſo fair, his manners ſo generous, that the beſt people ſhewed him a regard which they often deny men of their own color, becauſe not bleſſed with like goodneſs of heart.</p>
               <p>"In 1756, a fire happened which burned down great part of the town, and ruined many of the inhabitants. Joſeph luckily lived in a quarter that eſcaped the deſtruction, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his thankfulneſs, by ſoftening the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of his neighbours. Among thoſe who had loſt their all by this heavy misfortune, was a man to whoſe family Joſeph, in the early part of life, owed ſome obligations. This man, by too great hoſpitality, an exceſs common enough in the Weſt Indies, had involved his affairs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſire happened, and his eſtate lying in
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:022434_0038_0FB87CFFB76FE8E8"/>houſes, that event entirely ruined him, he eſcaping with only the clothes on his back. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the cries of miſery and want which excited Joſeph's compaſſion, that man's unfortunate ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation claimed particular notice. The gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, the open temper of the ſufferer, the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations that Joſeph had to his family, were ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and powerful motives for acting towards him the friendly part.</p>
               <p>Joſeph had his bond for ſixty pounds ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. "Unfortunate man, (ſays he) this ſhall never come againſt thee. Would Heaven thou could ſettle all thy other matters as eaſily! But how am I ſure that I ſhall keep in this mind: may not the love of gold, eſpecially, when by length of time thy misfortune has become fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to me, return with too ſtrong a current, and bear down my fellow feeling before it? But for this I have a remedy. Never ſhalt thou apply for the aſſiſtance of any friend againſt my avarice." He got up, ordered a current account that the man had with him to a conſiderable a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to be drawn out, and with a whim that might have called up a ſmile on the face of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, filled his pipe, ſat down again, twiſted the bond, and lighted his pipe with it. While the account was drawing out he continued ſmoking in a ſtate of mind a monarch might envy. When
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:022434_0039_0FB87D0138A5F018"/>finiſhed he went in ſearch of his friend, with the account diſcharged, and the mutilated bond in his hand. On meeting with him he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the papers to him with this addreſs. 'Sir, I am ſenſibly affected with your misfortunes— the obligations that I have received from your family, give me a relation to every branch of it. I know that your inability to ſatisfy for what you owe, gives you more uneaſineſs than the loſs of your own ſubſiſtence. That you may not be anxious on my account in particular, accept of this diſcharge, and the remains of your bond. I am overpaid in the ſatisfaction that I feel from having done my duty. I beg you to conſider this only as a token of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs that you will impart to me whenever you put it in my power to do you a good office.' One may eaſily gueſs at the man's feelings, on being thus generouſly treated, and how much his mind muſt have been ſtrengthened to bear up againſt his misfortunes. I knew him a few years after this; he had got a ſmall poſt in one of the forts, and preſerved a decent appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance." Page 254.</p>
               <p>In Aſtley's Voyages it is mentioned, ſpeaking of The Manners and Cuſtoms of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Kongo, that, "although ſome of them be ſurly and proud, yet in general they
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:022434_0040_0FB87D0437B5C7A0"/>carry themſelves very friendly towards ſtrangers; being of a mild converſation, courteous, affable, and eaſy to be overcome with reaſon, yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to drink, eſpecially Spaniſh wine and brandy." Vol. III. page 247.</p>
               <p>It appears to me that theſe people muſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally have poſſeſſed a good diſpoſition, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting their paſſion for ſtrong liquors) and a great inclination to hoſpitality, who could be very friendly towards ſtrangers, when they had found ſo many ſtrangers to be treacherous and wicked. It is aſtoniſhing that they did not all ſeem ſurly and proud.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, there are ſome travellers who give very unfavorable accounts of the morals of ſome black nations. Their accounts are certainly not wholly devoid of truth. But does not hiſtory and experience furniſh us with undeniable proofs of the monſtrous and exceſſive wickedneſs of white nations?

               </argument>
               <p>IT has been ſaid by ſome in defence of the Slave Trade, that the Negroes purchaſed in Africa, are priſoners of war, or criminals, who have juſtly forfeited their liberty; that the trade will prevent them from cutting one another's throats; and that it may be the means of initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating them into the principles of chriſtianity. It muſt be allowed that ſome of the Negroes who are purchaſed in Africa are priſoners of war, or criminals; but it can be proved by the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtable evidence, that moſt of thoſe who are taken from thence are innocent people, who have in no manner whatever forfeited their right to freedom. Francis Moore, who was Factor for the Engliſh African Company, on the river Gambia, ſays, "The Kings of that country generally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe with their head-men, ſcarcely doing any thing of conſequence without conſulting them firſt, except the King of Barſalli, who being ſubject to hard-drinking, is very abſolute. It is to this King's inſatiable thirſt for brandy, that his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects' freedoms and families are in ſo precarious a ſituation." Page 61. In another place he ſays, "Whenever this King wants goods or brandy, he ſends a meſſenger to the Engliſh
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:022434_0042_0FB87D073819FFE0"/>Governor, at James Fort, to deſire he would ſend a ſloop there with a cargo; this news being not at all unwelcome, the Governor ſends ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; againſt the arrival of the ſloop, the King goes and ranſacks ſome of his enemies' towns, ſeizing the people, and ſelling them for ſuch commodities as he is in want of, which commonly is brandy, guns, powder, balls, piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tols and cutlaſſes for his attendants and ſoldiers; and coral and ſilver for his wives and concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> caſe he is not at war with any neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring King, he then falls upon one of his own towns, which are numerous, and uſes them in the ſame manner. He often goes with ſome of his troops by a town in the day-time, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning in the night, ſets fire to three parts of it, and putting guards at the fourth, there ſeizes the people as they run out from the fire; he ties their arms behind them, and marches them either to Joar or Cohone, where he ſells them to the Europeans." Page 46. Andrew Brue, the principal Factor for the French African Company, and who reſided a conſiderable time in Africa, ſays, "That having received goods he wrote to Damel, (King of Kayor) that if he had a ſufficient number of ſlaves, he was ready to trade with him. This Prince, as well as the other Negro Monarchs, has always a ſure way of ſupplying his de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iciencies by ſelling his
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:022434_0043_0FB87D08BA144558"/>own ſubjects, for which they ſeldom want ſome pretenſion or other. Damel had recourſe to this method: he ſeized three hundred of his own people, and ſent word to Brue that he had ſlaves to deliver for his goods." Aſtley's Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Voyages, vol. 2, page 29. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he ſays, "that ſome of the natives are, on all occaſions, endeavouring to ſurpriſe and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry off their country people. They land with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out noiſe, and if they find a lone cottage, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out defence, they ſurround it, and carry off all the people and effects to their boat, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately reimbark." Page 98. Barbot, the French Factor, ſays, "It is well known that many of the European nations, trading amongſt theſe people, have very unjuſtly and inhumanly, without any provocation, ſtolen away, from time to time, abundance of the people, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on this coaſt, but almoſt every where in Guinea, who have come on board their ſhips in a harmleſs and confiding manner. Theſe they have in great numbers carried away, and ſold in the plantations with other ſlaves, which they had purchaſed." Page 110. It is alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by writers of a later date, that Negroes are frequently ſtolen from the coaſt of Africa; and that the Kings of that country, ſeize by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, their innocent ſubjects, to ſell them to the Europeans. It is ſaid in an account of the
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:022434_0044_0FB87D0A375B2C50"/>Slave Trade on the Coaſt of Africa, by Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Falconbridge, late Surgeon in the African Trade, London, printed, 1788; "Upon the windward coaſt another mode of procuring ſlaves is purſued; which is, by what they term boating; a mode that is very pernicious and deſtructive to the crews of the ſhips. The ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors who are employed upon this trade go in boats upon the rivers ſeeking for Negroes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the villages ſituated upon the banks of them. But this method is very ſlow, and not always effectual. For, after being abſent from the ſhip during a fortnight or three weeks they ſometimes return with only from eight to twelve Negroes. Numbers of theſe are procured in conſequence of alledged crimes, which, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerved, when any ſhips are upon the coaſt, are more productive than at any other pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod. Kidnapping, however, prevails here.</p>
               <p>"I have good reaſon to believe, that of one hundred and twenty Negroes, which were pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed for the ſhip to which I belonged then lying at the river Ambris, by far the greater part, if not the whole, were kidnapped. This, with various other inſtances confirms me in the belief, that kidnapping is the fund which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies the thouſands of Negroes annually ſold off theſe extenſive windward and other coaſts where
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:022434_0045_0FB87D0C33F383C8"/>boating prevails." Page 18. It is ſaid in a pamphlet, which was printed in London in 1789, entitled, Obſervations on the Slave Trade, and a Deſcription of ſome part of the Coaſt of Guinea, during a Voyage made in 1787 and 1788, in company with Doctor A.

Wadſtrom, Chief Director of the Royal Aſſay and Refining Office; Member of the Royal Chamber of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and of the Royal Patriotic Society for improving Agriculture, Manufactures, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce in Sweden. "The King of Almammy had, in the year 1787, very much to his honor, enacted a law, that no ſlave, whatever, ſhould be marched through his territories. At this time ſeveral French veſſels lay at anchor in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negal, waiting for ſlaves. The route of the black traders in conſequence of this edict of the King was ſtopped, and the ſlaves carried to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts. The French, unable on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, to complete their cargoes, remonſtrated with the King. He was, however, very unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious to their repreſentations, for he returned the preſents which had been ſent him by the Senegal Company, of which I myſelf was a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; declaring at the ſame time, that all the riches of that Company ſhould not divert him from his deſign. In this ſituation of affairs the French were obliged to have recourſe to their
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:022434_0046_0FB87D0DDDAF5D80"/>old friends the Moors. Theſe, who had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhewn themſelves ſo ready on ſuch occaſions, were no leſs ready and active on this. They ſet off in parties to ſurpriſe the unoffending Negroes, and to carry among them all the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities of war. Many unfortunate priſoners were ſent, and for ſome time continued to be ſent in. I was once curious enough to ſee ſome of thoſe that had juſt arrived. I applied to the director of the Company, who conducted me to the ſlave-priſons. I there ſaw the unfortunate captives chained two and two together, by the foot. The mangled bodies of ſeveral of them, whoſe wounds were ſtill bleeding, exhibited a moſt ſhocking ſpectacle; and their ſituation may be much eaſier conceived than deſcribed. The Director of the Company, however, uſed his beſt means to conſole them.</p>
               <p>"This is a ſpecific inſtance clearly ſhewing that <hi>one war at leaſt</hi> was undertaken for the ſole purpoſe of procuring ſlaves. I cannot, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, help obſerving, that if no ſuch inſtance as this had come within my knowledge during my ſtay in thoſe parts, I ſhould yet have thought myſelf juſtifiable in ſuppoſing that the wars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Negroes originated in the ſlave trade. For in all the obſervations I have been able to make (and I went to the Coaſt of Africa, not
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:022434_0047_0FB87D0EB8647A48"/>with any commercial views, but for the ſole purpoſe of inquiry and obſervation) I have ever conſidered the Negroes as a quiet, inoffenſive people, happy in themſelves, and in one another enjoying the comforts of life, without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention of toil and trouble. If, therefore, I had found wars among a people of ſuch diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, and ſo ſituated as to have no motive for them, I ſhould certainly have ſet them down, as having been excited for ſome diabolical pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and for none ſo likely as the proſecution of the ſlave trade." Pages 4, 5, and 6. In another place he ſays—"A ſecond ſource from whence the Europeans are ſupplied with ſlaves on the Coaſt of Africa, is pillage, which is of two kinds; public and private. It is public, when practiſed by the direction of the kings, private, when practiſed by individuals. I muſt alſo make a further diſtinction, namely, as it is practiſed by the blacks and the whites. This laſt I call robbery, which will be the ſubject of the next article.</p>
               <p>"The public pillage is of all others the moſt plentiful ſource from which the ſlave trade de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives its continuance and ſupport. The Kings of Africa, (I mean in that part of the country which I have viſited) incited by the merchandiſe ſhewn them, which conſiſts principally of ſtrong
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:022434_0048_0FB87D1039AA7F38"/>liquors, give orders to their military to attack their own villages in the night. Saturday night is particularly fixed upon for this purpoſe, being eſteemed the moſt lucky for expeditions of this kind. However, when ſlaves are wanted in haſte, no night is deemed ſo inauſpicious as to prevent an attempt.</p>
               <p>"As I have been myſelf an eye witneſs to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of theſe nocturnal exhibitions, it will, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, be better to illuſtrate this kind of pillage by ſome examples.</p>
               <p>"The French make preſents to the Negro as well as the Mooriſh Kings. It happened when I was at Goree, that an Ambaſſador was to be ſent from thence to the King of Barbeſin on this errand. I obtained leave with my fellow-tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers to accompany the embaſſy. We accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſet out and arrived at Joal, a place where the King reſides at particular times of the year, viz. when the trading veſſels arrive there.</p>
               <p>"It is uſual on the receipt of theſe preſents to ſend back a number of ſlaves in return. It ſo happened, however, that the King of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſin had no ſlaves in poſſeſſion at that time. This circumſtance it was that afforded me an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſeeing the expeditions before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>

"We reſided, I believe, about a week at Joal. During our reſidence there, the pillage, of which I have been ſpeaking, was attempted almoſt every night. The following is a deſcip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the perſons concerned in it, and of their various ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>"There were ſeveral parties of the military aſſembled at fix in the evening, or about duſk. Each party conſiſted of about ten or twelve. A large horſeman's muſquet was reſted on each of their ſaddles, in the ſame manner as thoſe of the Engliſh heavy cavalry. On their ſhoulders were ſuſpended a bow and a quiver full of arrows.— Thus equipped, they went to different villages belonging to the King, and returned uſually a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five in the morning, or a little before day-light." Page 7, 8 and 9. Afterwards he ſays, "At another time, the military, who had been ſent out to pillage, returned with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral captives. Theſe conſiſted of men, women, and children. The men, as they were brought in, exhibited great marks of dejection. One of them, however, appeared to be quite f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic with grief. He beſeeched his captors, with great fervency, that they would not tear him from his wife and children. The women, on the other hand, vented their ſorrow in ſhrieks and lamentations. The children, in a ſtate of
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:022434_0050_0FB87D13F891FEA0"/>palpitation, clung to their mother's breaſts. Their little eyes were ſo ſwelled with crying that they could cry no more. During all this time the captors, to ſhew their joy on the occaſion, and to drown the cries of their unfortunate fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-ſubjects, were beating large drums. To this was added all the noiſe that could be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the blowing of horns, and the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man voice. Taking in the ſhrieks and agony of the one, and the ſhouts and joy of the other, with the concomitant inſtruments of noiſe, I was never before witneſs to ſuch an infernal ſcene.</p>
               <p>"What I have ſaid of the King of Barbeſin's conduct with reſpect to the mode of procuring ſlaves is equally applicable to thoſe other Kings of the country of whom I have any knowledge. King Damel, whoſe dominious lie between Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal and Senegal, wanting a ſlave to deliver in exchange for ſome goods he had bargained for with a Goree trader, ordered his ſoldiers to ſeize on one of his own ſubjects. Finding a woman (whoſe huſband was abſent) in a hut with their children, they ſeized her, bound her, and tore her from her babes, who were reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as not being able to perform the journey to the ſhore."

               <p>The celebrated Mr. Clarkſon, in a work publiſhed in London, in 1789, which he calls

In page 4 and 5 he mentions, "In the King's Bench—The King againſt Lippincot and others—"William Floyd, of the city of Briſtol, mariner, maketh oath and ſaith, that he hath ſailed out of the port of Briſtol, and been employed in the African trade, as Mate and Maſter of a veſſel, about twenty years.</p>

               <p>That the ſlave-trade will prevent the Negroes from cutting one another's throats is an aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion totally unſupported by reaſon or experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. It is moſt certain that it has a contrary effect, that it tends to promote an inceſſant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention between the people of Africa, and to deluge the land with blood. Anthony Benezet mentions, in his Hiſtorical Account of Guinea, page 119, from an original manuſcript jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of a perſon of credit, who went Surgeon on the ſame trade, in a veſſel from New-York; "Being on the coaſt, the Commander of the veſſel, according to cuſtom, ſent a perſon on ſhore with a preſent to the King, acquainting him with his arrival, and letting him know they wanted a cargo of ſlaves. The King promiſed to furniſh them with ſlaves; and in order to do it, ſet out to go to war againſt his enemies; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to ſurpriſe ſome town, and take all the people priſoners: Some time after the King ſent them word he had not yet met with the deſired ſucceſs, having been twice repulſed in
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:022434_0056_0FB87D1CF9475868"/>attempting to break up two towns; but that he ſtill hoped to procure a number of ſlaves for them; and in this deſign he perſiſted till he met his enemies in the field, where a battle was fought which laſted three days, during which time the engagement was ſo bloody that four thouſand five hundred men were ſlain on the ſpot." The author of the journal, who beheld the dead bodies on the field after the battle, ſays, "Think what a pitiable ſight it was to ſee the widows weeping over their loſt huſbands, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans deploring the loſs of their fathers, &amp;c." Mr Clarkſon ſays, in his admirable Eſſay on the Slavery and Commerce of the human Species, particularly the African.—"Another argument yet remains, which, though nature will abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely turn pale at the recital, cannot poſſibly be omitted. In thoſe wars, which are made for the ſake of procuring ſlaves, it is evident that the conteſt muſt be generally obſtinate, and that great numbers muſt be ſlain on both ſides, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the event can be determined. This we may reaſonably apprehend to be the caſe: and we have ſhewn that there have not been wanting inſtances, where the conquerors have been ſo incenſed at the reſiſtance they have found, that their ſpirit of vengeance has entirely got the better of their avarice, and they have murdered in cool blood, every individual, without diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:022434_0057_0FB87D1E79A79138"/>either of age or ſex: From theſe and other circumſtances, we thought we had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon to conclude, that where <hi>ten</hi> were ſuppoſed to be taken, an <hi>hundred,</hi> including the victors and vanquiſhed, might be ſuppoſed to periſh. Now, as the annual exportation from Africa conſiſts of an hundred thouſand men, and as the two orders of thoſe who are private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kidnapped by individuals, and of thoſe who are publicly ſeized, by virtue of the authority of their Prince, compoſe together, at leaſt, nine-tenths of the African ſlaves, it follows, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ten thouſand conſiſt of convicts and priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of war. The laſt order is the moſt numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Let us ſuppoſe then that only ſix thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of this order are annually ſent into ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and it will immediately appear that no leſs than <hi>ſixty thouſand</hi> people annually periſh in thoſe wars, which are made only for the purpoſe of procuring ſlaves. But that this number, which we believe to be by no means exaggerated, may be free from all objection, we will include thoſe in the eſtimate who die as they are travelling to the ſhips. Many of theſe unfortunate people have a journey of one thouſand miles to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form on foot, and are driven like ſheep through inhoſpitable woods and deſerts, where they fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently die in great numbers, from fatigue and want. Now if to thoſe who thus periſh on the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:022434_0058_0FB87D2177AC2E98"/>African continent by want and travelling, we ſubjoin thoſe who afterwards periſh on the voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and in the ſeaſoning together, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that, in every yearly attempt to ſupply the Colonies, an <hi>hundred thouſand</hi> muſt periſh even before <hi>one</hi> uſeful individual can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e obtained.</p>
               <p>"Gracious GOD! how wicked, how be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all example impious, muſt be that ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which cannot be carried on without the continual murder of ſo many and innocent per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons! What puniſhment is not to be expected for ſuch monſtrous and unparalleled barbarities! For if the blood of one man, unjuſtly ſhed, cries with ſo loud a voice for the Divine vengeance, how ſhall the cries and groans of an <hi>hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand</hi> men, <hi>annually murdered,</hi> aſcend the celeſtial manſions, and bring down that puniſhment which ſuch enormities deſerve!" Page 152 and 153.</p>
               <p>It ſeems a ſorry argument in favor of the ſlave-trade that it may be the means of initiating the Negroes into the principles of Chriſtianity. It was not in this manner that the Apoſtles pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated the goſpel. St. Paul, in his firſt Epiſtle to Timothy, ranks men-ſtealers among the very worſt of mankind. The penalty for this foul crime was death by the Moſaic law. "And he that ſtealeth a man and ſelleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he ſhall ſurely be put to death." Exodus, xxi. 16.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>WHEN the Negroes are objected to by the Captains on account of age, ſickneſs, deformity, or any reaſon whatever, they are frequently beaten and treated with great cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the traders. At New Calabar, it is ſaid, by Alexander Falconbridge, in his Account of the Slave-Trade, on the Coaſt of Africa, the black traders have frequently in theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances put them to death. They have been known to drop their canoes under the ſtern of the veſſel, and inſtantly to behead them in ſight of the ſhip's crew —Mr. Clarkſon ſays, in his Subſtance of the Evidence of ſundry Perſons on the Slave-Trade. "Mr. — was lying in the —, in Benin river. At the time alluded to Captain Lemma Lemma, a great trader of Benin was on board. This trader, happening to be on deck, obſerved a canoe with three people in it, croſſing the above river. Upon ſeeing it he diſpatched a war canoe, which was then lying along ſide the —; and on board of which were five of his people, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit. They preſently came up with the canoe aforeſaid, and having ſeized her brought her
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:022434_0060_0FB87D247751D5B0"/>along ſide of the —. The three people were then taken out of the canoe, and brought on board. They conſiſted of a father, ſon, and daughter. The two latter were ſold to the Chief Mate, Captain — being then at the Factory at Gatoe. The former, on account of his age, was refuſed. Upon this Capt. Lemma Lemma ordered his people to take him into his own canoe, which they accordingly did, but laid his head upon the thwart of the boat, and in two ſtrokes with a cutlaſs cut it off. This Mr. — ſaw with his own eyes." Page 33. The Negroes upon being brought on board the veſſel as ſlaves, will ſometimes, eſpecially the women, become inſane; which to a feeling mind muſt greatly add to the horror of the ſcene, though it may be matter of laughter to the unfeeling. They will ſometimes jump into the ſea to eſcape the fangs of the oppreſſor, or aim at the deſtruction of themſelves by ſome other means. They often attempt inſurrections. "The men Negroes (ſays Alex. Falconbridge) on being brought aboard the ſhip are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately faſtened together, two a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> two, by hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuffs on their wriſts, and by irons riveted on their legs. They are then ſent down between the decks, and placed in an apartment partition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed off for that purpoſe. The women likewiſe are placed in a ſeparate apartment between
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:022434_0061_0FB87D25F9C88E88"/>decks, but without being ironed. And an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining room, on the ſame deck, is beſides ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the boys. Thus are they all placed in different apartments.</p>
               <p>"But at the ſame time they are frequently ſtowed ſo cloſe, as to admit of no other poſture than lying on their ſides. Neither will the height between decks, unleſs directly under the grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, permit them the indulgence of an erect poſture; eſpecially where there are platforms, which is generally the caſe. Theſe platforms are a kind of ſhelf, about eight or nine feet in breadth, extending from the ſide of the ſhip towards the center. They are placed nearly midway between the decks, at the diſtance of two or three feet from each deck. Upon theſe the Negroes are ſtowed in the ſame manner as they are on the deck underneath." Page 20.</p>
               <p>The annexed plate is a copy of that which was lately publiſhed in England by the Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of the Plymouth Society for the Abolition of the Slave-Trade. "The annexed plate (they ſay) repreſents the lower deck of an African ſhip of two hundred and ninety ſeven tons bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, with the ſlaves ſtowed in it, in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of not quite one to a ton.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="unknown:022434_0062_0FB87D294BE57C88"/>
"In the men's apartment the ſpace allowed to each is ſix feet in length, by ſixteen inches in breadth. The boys are each allowed five feet by fourteen inches. The women five feet ten inches, by ſixteen inches; and the girls four feet by one foot each. The perpendicular height between the decks is five feet eight inches.— It may perhaps be conceived from the crowded ſtate in which the ſlaves appear in the plate, that an unuſual and exaggerated inſtance has been produced; this, however, is ſo far from being the caſe, that no ſhip, if her intended cargo can be procured, ever carries a leſs number than one to a ton, and the uſual practice has been to carry double that number. The bill which was paſſed the laſt ſeſſions of Parliament, only reſtricts the carriage to five ſlaves for three tons; and the Brooks, of Liverpool, a capital ſhip, from which the annexed ſketch was proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, did, in one voyage, actually carry ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and nine ſlaves, which is more than double the number that appear in the plate. The mode of ſtowing them was as follows: platforms, or wide ſhelves, were erected between the decks, extending ſo far from the ſides towards the middle of the veſſel, as to be capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining four additional rows of ſlaves, by which means the perpendicular height between each tier, after allowing for the beams and platforms,
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:022434_0063_0FB87D2A78AFD740"/>was reduced to two feet ſix inches, ſo that they could not even ſit in an erect poſture; beſides which, in the men's apartments, inſtead of four rows, five were ſtowed, by placing the heads of one between the thighs of another. All the horrors of this ſituation are ſtill multiplied in the ſmaller veſſels. The Kitty of one hundred and thirty-ſeven tons, had only one foot ten inches, and the Venus, of one hundred and forty-ſix tons, only one foot nine inches perpendicular height, above each laver."</p>
               <p>Alexander Falconbridge in his before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned publication ſays, "About eight o'clock in the morning the Negroes are generally brought upon deck. Their irons being examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a long chain, which is locked to a ring-bolt, fixed in the deck, is run through the rings of the ſhackles of the men, and then locked to another ring-bolt, fixed alſo in the deck. By this means fifty or ſixty, and ſometimes more, are faſtened to one chain, in order to prevent them from riſing, or endeavoring to eſcape. If the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proves favorable, they are permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in that ſituation till four or five in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon, when they are diſengaged from the chain, and ſent down." Page 21.</p>
               <p>In another place he ſays, "Upon the Negroes refuſing to take ſuſtenance, I have ſeen coals of
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:022434_0064_0FB87D2BF8194848"/>fire, glowing hot, put on a ſhovel, and placed ſo near their lips, as to ſcorch and burn them. And this has been accompanied with threats, of forcing them to ſwallow the coals, if they any longer perſiſted in refuſing to eat. Theſe means have generally had the deſired effect I have alſo been credibly informed, that a certain Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in the ſlave-trade, poured melted lead on ſuch of the Negroes as obſtinately refuſed their food." Page 23.</p>
               <p>Again he ſays, "On board ſome ſhips, the common ſailors are allowed to have intercourſe with ſuch of the black women whoſe conſent they can procure. And ſome of them have been known to take the inconſtancy of their para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours ſo much to heart, as to leap overboard, and drown themſelves. The officers are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to indulge their paſſions among them at pleaſure, and ſometimes are guilty of ſuch bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal exceſſes, as diſgrace human nature.</p>
               <p>"The hardſhips and inconveniences ſuffered by the Negroes during the paſſage are ſcarcely to be enumerated or conceived. They are far more violently affected by the ſea-ſickneſs, than the Europeans. It frequently terminates in death, eſpecially among the women. But the excluſion of the freſh air is among the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable.
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:022434_0065_0FB87D2DE7C63870"/>For the purpoſe of admitting this needful refreſhment, moſt of the ſhips in the ſlave-trade are provided between the decks, with five or ſix air-ports on each ſide of the ſhip, of about ſix inches in length, and four in breadth: in addition to which, ſome few ſhips, but not one in twenty, have what they denominate <hi>wind-ſails.</hi> But whenever the ſea is rough, and the rain heavy, it becomes neceſſary to ſhut theſe, and every other conveyance by which the air is admitted. The freſh air being thus excluded, the Negroes' rooms very ſoon grow intolerably hot. The confined air, rendered noxious by the effluvia exhaled from their bodies, and by being repeatedly breathed ſoon produces fevers and fluxes, which generally carry off great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of them.</p>
               <p>"During the voyages I made I was frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a witneſs to the fatal effects of this excluſion of the freſh air. I will give one inſtance, as it ſerves to convey ſome idea, though a very faint one, of the ſuffering of thoſe unhappy beings whom we wantonly drag from their native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and doom to perpetual labor and captivity. Some wet and blowing weather having occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the port-holes to be ſhut, and the granting to be covered, fluxes and fevers among the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes enſued. While they were in this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:022434_0066_0FB87D2EF73C9060"/>as my profeſſion required it, I frequently went down among them, till at length their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments became ſo extremely hot, as to be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffered for a very ſhort time. But the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive heat was not the only thing that render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ſituation intolerable. The deck, that is the floor of their rooms, was ſo covered with the blood and mucus, which had proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them in conſequence of the flux, that it reſembled a ſlaughter-houſe. It is not in the power of human imagination to picture to itſelf a ſituation more dreadful or diſguſting. Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the ſlaves having fainted they were carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon deck, where ſeveral of them died, and the reſt were with great difficulty reſtored. It had nearly proved fatal to me alſo." Page 24 and 25.</p>
               <p>This author mentions that a ſmall ſhip from Liverpool took in near ſeven hundred ſlaves.— "By purchaſing ſo great a number (he ſays) the ſlaves were ſo crowded that they were obliged to lie, one upon another. This occaſioned ſuch a mortality among them, that, without meeting with unuſual bad weather, or having a longer voyage than common, nearly one half of them died before the ſhip arrived in the Weſt-Indies." Page 26.</p>

He ſays, "The place allotted for the ſick Negroes is under the half deck, where they lie on the bare planks. By this means thoſe who are emaciated, frequently have their ſkin, and even their fleſh, entirely rubbed off, by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſhip, from the prominent parts of the ſhoulders, elbows, and hips, ſo as to render the bones in thoſe parts quite bare. And ſome of them, by conſtantly lying in the blood and mucus, that had flowed from thoſe afflicted with the flux, and which, as before obſerved, is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo violent as to prevent their being kept clean, have their fleſh much ſooner rubbed off, than thoſe who have only to contend with the mere friction of the ſhip. The excruciating pain which the poor ſufferers feel from being obliged to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in ſuch a dreadful ſituation, frequently for ſeveral week, in caſe they happen to live ſo long, is not to be conceived or deſcribed. Few, indeed, are ever able to withſtand the fatal effects of it." Pages 27, 28.</p>
               <p>The Rev. John Newton, ſays, in his Thoughts on the African Slave-Trade. London, printed 1788. "With the Engliſh ſhips on the coaſt the great object is to be full. When the ſhip is there it is thought deſireable ſhe ſhould take as many as poſſible. The cargo of a veſſel of one hundred tons, or little more, is calculated to

                  </gap> from two hundred and twenty to two hundred and fifty ſlaves. Their lodging rooms, below the deck, which are three (for the men, the boys, and the women) beſides a place for the ſick, are ſometimes more than five feet high, and ſometimes leſs; and this height is divided towards the middle for the ſlaves lie in two rows, one above the other, on each ſide of the ſhip, cloſe to each other, like books upon a ſhelf. I have known them ſo cloſe that the ſhelf would not eaſily contain one more. And I have known a white man ſent down among the men to lay them, in theſe rows, to the greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, ſo that as little ſpace as poſſible might be loſt. Let it be obſerved that the poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures thus cramped for want of room are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in irons, for the moſt part both hands and feet, and two together, which makes it difficult for them to turn or move, to attempt either to riſe or life down without hurting themſelves or each other. Nor is the motion of the ſhip, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially her heeling, or ſtoop on one ſide, when under ſail, to be omitted; for this as they lie athwart or acroſs the ſhip, adds to the uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortableneſs of their lodging, eſpecially to thoſe who lie on the leeward, or leaning ſide of the veſſel.</p>
               <q>Dire is the toſſing, deep the groans.</q>

The heat and the ſmell of theſe rooms, when the weather will not admit of the ſlaves being brought upon deck, and of having their rooms cleaned every day, would be almoſt inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to a perſon not accuſtomed to them. If the ſlaves and their rooms be conſtantly aired, and they are not detained too long on board, perhaps there are not many die, but the contrary is often their lot. They are kept down by the weather to breathe a hot and corrupted air ſometimes for a week: this added to the galling of the irons, and the deſpondency which ſeizes their ſpirits, when thus confined, ſoon becomes fatal. And every morning, perhaps, more inſtances are found than one, of the living and the dead, like the captives of Menzentius faſtened toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Epidemical fevers and fluxes which fill the ſhip with noiſome and noxious effluvia, often break out, infect the ſeamen likewiſe, and the oppreſſor and oppreſſed fall by the ſame ſtroke. I believe nearly one half of the ſlaves on board have ſometimes died, and that the loſs of a third part in theſe circumſtances is not unuſual. The ſhip in which I was mate, left the coaſt with 218 ſlaves on board; and though we were not much affected with epidemical diſorders, I find by my journal of that voyage (now before me) that we
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:022434_0070_0FB87AD26B80D740"/>buried ſixty, on our paſſage to South-Carolina, excluſive of thoſe who died before we left the coaſt, of whom I have no account.</p>
               <p>"I believe upon an average between the more healthy and the more ſickly voyages, and including all contingencies, one fourth of the whole purchaſe may be allotted to the article of mortality. That is, if the Engliſh ſhips pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe ſixty thouſand ſlaves annually upon the whole extent of the coaſt, the annual loſs of lives cannot be much leſs than fifteen thouſand." Pages 19 and 20.</p>
               <p>This author mentions a ſhocking inſtance of inhumanity in a mate of a veſſel with whom he once ſailed. The mate was carrying in a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boat, to the ſhip, a Negro woman whom he had bought, who had a ſmall child. The child would often cry, which enraged him ſo much, that he at laſt ſnatched it from the mother and threw it into the ſea.</p>
               <p>Mr. Wadſtrom the author whom we quoted in the preceeding chapter ſays, "I am very ſorry that humanity obliges me here to divulge a moſt barbarous practice, frequently uſed by the French traders in the middle paſſage. I have been aſſured by ſeveral of their merchants
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:022434_0071_0FB87AD339D242E8"/>captains, that when detained by calms or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary winds occaſioning a ſhortneſs of proviſions and water, or when ſome fatal diſeaſe happens to break out among the ſlaves, they never fail to mix corroſive ſublimate, or ſome other active poiſon with their victuals, and thus coolly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch the wretches committed to their charge. They affirm that it would be an act of impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to undertake ſuch a voyage unprovided with poiſonous drugs, and they boaſt of being leſs cruel than the Dutch and Engliſh, who in ſimilar circumſtances, throw the innocent vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims over-board, without ceremony. Since my arrival in London, this horrid practice has been authenticated by the reſpectable authority of ſeveral French gentlemen.</p>
               <p>"Of the above cruel practice my Journal furniſhes a melancholy inſtance communicated to me by Capt. L. of Havre-de-Grace. About two years ago a ſlave-veſſel, belonging to Breſt, having been becalmed on the middle paſſage, fell ſhort of proviſions and water.

It is the general cuſtom of the Captains of the veſſels in the ſlave-trade, if there ſhould be occaſion on account of bad weather, to throw ſome of the Negroes overboard to lighten the ſhip. This is alſo done without reluctance, if there ſhould be any fear that proviſions or wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould fall ſhort before the arrival of the ſhip at its deſtined port. Mr. Clarkſon, however, in his celebrated Eſſay on the Slavery and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the Human Species, particularly the African, ſays, "But indeed ſo lightly are theſe unhappy people eſteemed that their lives have even been taken away upon ſpeculation: there has been an inſtance within the laſt five years of <hi>one hundred and thirty-two</hi> of them being thrown into the ſea, becauſe it was ſuppoſed that by this <hi>trick</hi> their value could be recovered from the inſurers. This inſtance happened in a ſhip, commanded by one Collingwood. On the 29th of November, 1781, fifty four of them were
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:022434_0073_0FB87AD63AE90630"/>thrown into the ſea alive, on the 30th forty-two more; and in about three days afterwards, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſix. Ten others, who were brought upon the deck for the ſame purpoſe, did not wait to be hand-cuffed, but bravely leaped into the ſea, and ſhared the fate of their companions. It is a fact, that the people on board this ſhip had not been put upon ſhort allowance. The excuſe that this execrable wretch made on board for his conduct, was the following, "that if the ſlaves, who were then ſickly had died a natural death, the loſs would have been the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; but as they were thrown alive into the ſea, it would fall upon the underwriters." Page 88 and 89.</p>
               <p>I would now appeal to the heart of every feeling and intelligent perſon, and aſk them if they think a more horrible ſcene of cruelty and wickedneſs, than this can eaſily be deſcribed?— One would think that every man who attends to it, if he is not a villain, muſt be fired with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation at it. I would appeal particularly to the ſenſibility and the virtue of my female rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, many of whom know the beauty, the cleanlineſs, the healthineſs, the peace, the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the dignity, the ſanctity of chaſtity, and how preferable it is to the miſery, the filth, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſomeneſs, the ſervitude, the debaſement,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:022434_0074_0FB87AD7BA54D898"/>the brutality, of incontinence. It is impoſſible but they muſt feel exquiſitely for the condition of any of their ſex where their perſons can be violated with impunity. It is their duty, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to do more than to feel—to act for their relief.

                     <hi>Of the Treatment of the Negroes in the Weſt-Indies and other places.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE appearance of a ſlave-ſhip in the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of a Weſt-India Iſland is the moſt horrible and diſguſting of any ſight that can be conceived. It is black with filth, and emits a moſt fetid ſmell. It is ſurrounded with ſharks of an enormous ſize, who have followed it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps from Guinea, and who appear eager to taſte again of thoſe carcaſes upon which they have frequently been fed. The Negroes upon their arrival in the Weſt Indies are ſometimes ſold by ſcramble. In a ſcramble the Negroes bear an equal price, which is ſettled before-hand with the purchaſers, and every man is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the Negro or Negroes which he can ſeize. It has been known that when the ſale in this manner has been made on board a ſhip, and when upon a ſignal given the purchaſers have ruſhed in upon the Negroes, they have been ſtruck with terror, and have jumped into the ſea. When they have been ſold in this manner in a merchant's yard on ſhore, they have been known to climb over the fence or wall that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded them, and to run wild and affrighted over the whole town. This fear proceeds greatly
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:022434_0077_0FB87ADCB8B5D280"/>from an opinion, very common among the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes lately taken from Africa, that the white people deſign to eat them. The moſt uſual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, however, of ſelling them, is on ſhore without a ſcramble. At the ſale the moſt ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indecencies are practiſed; and huſbands and wives, and parents and children, are ſeparated without reluctance, if it is inconvenient to the purchaſer that they ſhould be kept together. A Negro in ſome of the Weſt-India Iſlands and in ſome parts of America, has ſcarcely a greater protection, from the laws, than a horſe. The murder of a ſlave is in many places not puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by death, but by a pecuniary fine. The notorious and execrable law of Barbadoes, which is a diſgrace to human nature, ſays that "if any man ſhall of wantonneſs or only of bloody-mindedneſs, or cruel intention, wilfully kill a Negro, or other ſlave of his own, he ſhall deliver into the public treaſury, fifteen pounds ſterling, and not be liable to any other puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or forfeiture, for the ſame."—Laws of Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>badoes, Act 329.</p>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">It has been aſſerted in the newſpapers that this law has very lately been repealed; and that by the laws of Barbadoes the penalty of death, is now affixed to the murder of a Negro by a white man.</note>
               <p>The moſt wanton cruelties are daily practiſed upon the Negroes in the Weſt-Indies. I have
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:022434_0078_0FB87ADDB9CD0EE0"/>known, in an Iſland in the Weſt-Indies, where I reſided for ſome years, a Negro to be ſeverely whipped and to be inceſſantly perſecuted for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing his daughter to a manager of an eſtate, upon the plea that ſhe was from her early youth unripe for love, and that he had deſigned her at a more advanced age, for a young man of his own color, who was his friend, and attached to his daughter. Reader attend to the hand of Heaven, which was palpably raiſed for the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of this profligate villain, and if ever thou haſt committed an act of injuſtice or tyranny againſt any of thy fellow-creatures, know that thy crime can only be expiated by repentance, or by retribution here or hereafter. This man, whoſe name was Thomſon or Thompſon, left the eſtate on which he lived ſoon after the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of this Negro for refuſing his daughter to his peeviſh and damnable luſt, and entering into a privateer, accumulated in a ſhort time the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>m of a thouſand pounds. He returned to the Weſt-Indies, and quickly having conſumed his money in riot and debauchery, he was ſeized with a diſorder the conſequence of his amours. As he lay dying in a tavern, with what is called a corona veneris upon him, and putrid before his death, there were ſome gameſters in a near chamber to him, who were rattling the dice-box, and he was at laſt, unlamented, and almoſt unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:022434_0079_0FB87AE10E778978"/>thrown into a hole like a dead dog.— "Vengeance is mine; I will repay ſaith the Lord." Paul's Epiſtles. A fellow who had the management of an eſtate in the ſame iſland, is ſaid, when peeviſh from the gout, to have or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered a Negro-boy, as he was lying down, to bruſh the flies from his face, and to have threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened him with thirty nine laſhes for every fly that ſhould touch him. The conſequence is ſaid to have been, what we ſhould naturally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that in a hot country, where flies are nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, a great many ſettled upon the face of this ſcoundrel, and inexorable tyrant, and the boy was almoſt whipped to death. Sir Hans Sloane, in his introduction to the Natural Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Jamaica, ſays, "The puniſhments for crimes of ſlaves, are uſually for rebellions, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, by nailing them down on the ground, with crooked ſticks, on every limb, and then applying the fire by degrees from the feet and hands, burning them gradually up to the head, whereby <hi>their pains are extravagant;</hi> for crimes of a leſſer nature, gelding, or chopping off half the foot with an axe.

<pb n="82" facs="unknown:022434_0081_0FB87AE3B8A2FA48"/>uttered, as I thought, a few inarticulate mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyllables. Alarmed and ſurpriſed, I precipitate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looked all around, when I perceived at the diſtance of about ſix rods, ſomething reſembling a cage ſuſpended to the limb of a tree; all the branches of which appeared covered with large birds of prey,
<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe birds muſt have been Turkey Buzzards, of which ſee a deſcription in a magnificent work. The Natural Hiſtory of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolina.

Actuated by an involuntary motion of my hands, more than by any deſign of my mind, I fired at them; they all flew to a ſhort diſtance with a moſt hide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous noiſe; when, horrid to think, and painful to repeat, I perceived a Negro ſuſpended in a cage, and left to expire! I ſhudder when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect that the birds had already picked out his eyes; his cheek-bones were bare; his arms had been attacked in ſeveral places, and his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſeemed covered with a multitude of wounds. From the edges of the hollow ſockets, and from the lacerations with which he was disfigured, the blood ſlowly dropt, and tinged the ground be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath. No ſooner were the birds flown, than ſwarms of inſects covered the whole body of this unfortunate wretch, eager to feed on his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:022434_0082_0FB87AE546547BC0"/>fleſh, and to drink his blood. I found myſelf ſuddenly arreſted by the power of affright and terror; my nerves were convulſed; I trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled; I ſtood motionleſs, involuntarily contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating the fate of this Negro, in all its diſmal latitude. The living ſpectre, though deprived of his eyes, could diſtinctly hear, and in his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth dialect begged me to give him ſome water to allay his thirſt. Humanity herſelf would have recoiled back with horror; ſhe would have balanced whether to leſſen ſuch reliefleſs diſtreſs, or mercifully with one blow to end this dreadful ſcene of agonizing torture. Had I had a ball in my gun, I certainly ſhould have diſpatched him; but finding myſelf unable to perform ſo kind an office, I ſought, though trembling, to relieve him as well as I could. A ſhell, ready fixed to a pole, which had been uſed by ſome Negroes, preſented itſelf to me; I filled it with water, and with trembling hands I guided it to the quivering lips of the wretched ſufferer.— Urged by the irreſiſtible power of thirſt, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to meet it, as he inſtinctively gueſſed its approach by the noiſe it made in paſſing through the bars of the cage. "Tanke, you white man, tanke you, pute ſome poiſon, and give me." How long have you been hanging there? I aſked him. "Two days and me no die; the birds, the birds, aah me!" Oppreſſed
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:022434_0083_0FB87AE6C04D7038"/>with the reflections which this ſhocking ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle afforded me, I muſtered ſtrength to paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and ſoon reached the houſe at which I intended to dine. There I heard the reaſon for the ſlave being thus puniſhed, was on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his having killed the Overſeer of the plantation. They told me that the law of ſelf-preſervation rendered ſuch executions neceſſary, and ſupported the doctrine of ſlavery with the arguments generally made uſe of to juſtify the practiſe; with the repetition of which I ſhall not trouble you at preſent." Page 233, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The puniſhment of this Negro is ſomewhat ſimilar to the puniſhment of a Negro for mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the iſland of St. Euſtatius: an account of which is to be found in one of Dodſley's Annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Regiſters. The conduct of the Negro in St. Euſtatius ſeems, however, to have been more violent than the conduct of the Negro in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. As he was working on board a veſſel in the harbour of that iſland, he happened to kill a white man. At the inſtigation of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Negro, who was ſtanding by, and who told him he could be no more than hung if he killed ſeveral white men, he jumped into the ſea, ſwam to the town, and running a muck (as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain people are deſcribed in Hawkeſworth's
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:022434_0084_0FB87AE8DA135AA0"/>Voyages to do in Batavia) he was deſirous of killing every one he met. A reſolute ſailor at laſt overpowered him. He was condemned to ſuffer death by being put without food or water in a cage, which was raiſed ſome diſtance from the ground. He then became, after ſome time a moſt wretched ſpectacle, and his cries, for <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, water,</hi> were inceſſant. I believe the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in general which are mentioned of the execution of theſe two Negroes to be true. It is impoſſible for a benevolent mind to read of the torture to which they, but eſpecially the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro in America, were expoſed, without the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt horror. It is ſaid his crime was that of killing the Overſeer of the Plantation. He might have killed the overſeer in his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or he might have been provoked to it by injuries of the moſt galling and afflictive na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (which we know to be too often inflicted by tyrants on their ſlaves) by injuries, through which patience itſelf might have been irritated, and which the uncorrected paſſions of an Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can could not in any manner brook. We are told that oppreſſion will make even a wiſe man mad. But if we were to allow that the Negro killed the Overſeer unjuſtly, ſtill we muſt allow that the puniſhment to which he was expoſed was inhuman, and ſuch as ſhould not have been inflicted. If he had been guilty of a deliberate
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:022434_0085_0FB87AE9BAC73DC0"/>murder, it ſhould have been remembered, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, when he was put to death that he was a man. There is ſomething diabolical in torture; it begins to be exploded by civilized nations. It will be ſaid that executions like theſe are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſtrike terror into ſlaves. In anſwer to which I will obſerve that if ſuch executions are neceſſary where ſlavery is practiſed, it is a forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble argument for the abolition of it.</p>

<pb n="90" facs="unknown:022434_0089_0FB87AEFBA2F5320"/>is called law. We ſhould diſregard the law of man, where it is contrary to the law of God. It is ſaid by Attorney-General Noy, "It is a maxim of the common law of England, that "the inferior law muſt give place to the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, man's laws to GOD'S laws." Noy's Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims, page 19. It would be happy for mankind if this noble maxim were adopted by all the lawyers upon earth.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clarkſon in his Eſſay on the Slavery and Commerce of the human ſpecies, particularly the African, ſays, "An iron coffin, with holes in it, was kept by a certain coloniſt, as an auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary to the laſh. In this the poor victim of the Maſter's reſentment was incloſed, and placed ſufficiently near a fire, to occaſion extreme pain, and conſequently ſhrieks and groans, until the revenge of the maſter was ſatiated, without any other inconvenience on his part, than a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary ſuſpenſion of the ſlave's labor. Had he been ſlogged to death, or his limbs mutilated, the intereſt of the brutal tyrant would have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a more irreparable loſs." Page 97.</p>
               <p>It muſt give ſome conſolation to the friends of humanity to know that the cruelty which was practiſed upon the Negroes, begins in ſome places to be reſtrained by law. This may be
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:022434_0090_0FB87AF13A2A7CD8"/>greatly attributed to the clamor which has been raiſed by various writers in defence of theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted perſons, and ſhould urge thoſe who have abilities or information to greater exertions in the noble cauſe of vindicating the oppreſſed.— The Aſſembly of Jamaica have lately paſſed an act to meliorate the condition of the Negroes, and have affixed the penalty of death to the mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a Negro. The Aſſembly of Grenada have paſſed an act on the 3d of November 1788, "for the better protection, and for promoting the encreaſe and population of ſlaves." The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of this act, it is mentioned in the pream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is "to preſcribe reaſonable bounds to the power of maſters, and others, having the charge of ſlaves, by compelling them ſufficiently and properly to lodge, feed, cloath and maintain them, by introducing them to the knowledge of the chriſtian religion, and affording them opportunity of improvement in morality, and by inducing them to regular marriage, and when married protecting them in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugal rights." It is to be lamented that the act does not immediately prevent the further importation of ſlaves, but ſpeaks only of the "means of removing in the courſe of time the neceſſity of further importations from Africa." It is worthy, however, of high ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation in many particulars. It affixes a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty

The penalty preſcribed by this act for a Negroe's run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning away, is not death, but "ſuch puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not extending to life and limb," as two Juſtices of the Peace ſhall in their diſcretion or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be inflicted.</p>
               <p>It is to be lamented that this act does not lay a heavy penalty upon a crime which is very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the Weſt-Indies. I mean the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a young Negro girl, or her father, if the
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:022434_0094_0FB87AF73A24F6C8"/>girl at his inſtigation, ſhould not conſent to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify a planter's or a manager's luſt. I can vouch for the authenticity of the account which I have given of the flagitious conduct of one manager in this reſpect. It is mentioned in the Roman Hiſtory that a ſimilar attempt in Appius, a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cemvir, produced a revolution in Rome, and for ever overturned the power of him and his col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leagues. The people ſhocked at the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this magiſtrate, who wiſhed to debauch the daughter of a Centurion, fled from the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as from a polluted place. "What have we to do, (ſaid they) in a city, where neither chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nor liberty is ſafe." See Hooke's Roman Hiſtory, vol. 2, page 181, octavo. The cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Machiavel, though he often gives diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt advice to a Prince for the government of his kingdom, yet ſometimes gives him that which is very ſalutary. He recommends to him not to debauch the wives or daughters of his ſubjects, as ſuch actions have a tendency to inflame the mind with ſingular indignation, and to make the family who are injured attempt the ſubverſion of a government.</p>

                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT ſurely would not be impolitic in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries of Europe, or in the ſtates of America, to aboliſh the ſlave-trade. Here humanity would be doubly or trebly bleſt. It would not only bleſs thoſe who receive, but thoſe who give.— It would not only be advantageous to the Negro, but to the Planter or Farmer, and afterwards to the generous country which ſhould ſtretch out its hand to relieve the oppreſſed. The exiſtence of the European ſettlements would not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangered, nor would a defalcation of revenue enſue, from an abolition of the ſlave-trade. I am convinced that the abolition of the ſlave-trade would tend to the intereſt of the Planters, that it would make the condition of the Weſt-India iſlands more proſperous, and therefore that no diminution of revenue would enſue.— Long, in his Hiſtory of Jamaica, ſays, "The purchaſe of new Negroes is the moſt chargeable article attending theſe eſtates, and the <hi>true ſource</hi> of the diſtreſſes under which their owners ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer: for they involve themſelves ſo deeply in debt to make theſe <hi>inconſiderate</hi> purchaſes, and
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:022434_0096_0FB87AFC0C27EC58"/>loſe ſo many by diſeaſe or other means in the ſeaſoning, that they become unable to make good their engagements, are <hi>plunged in law ſuits and anxiety;</hi> while for want of ſome prudent regulation in the right huſbanding of their ſtock, and <hi>promoting its increaſe by natural means,</hi> they intail upon themſelves a neceſſity of drawing perpetual recruits of unſeaſoned Africans, the expence of which forms only a new addition <hi>to their debts and difficulties.</hi>" Vol. 1, page 437. The celebrated Mr. Clarkſon in his eſſay on the impolicy of the African ſlave-trade ſays, in confirmation of Mr. Long's Obſervations which he quotes; that in the iſland of Jamaica four Courts are annually held; in each of which Courts about three thouſand new actions are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually brought, chiefly upon bonds, nine tenths of which bonds have been given to the factors <hi>for new ſlaves.</hi> He ſays the principal part of the people who were confined in the goals of that iſland, were ſuch whoſe perſons had been ſeized, after their property had been found inadequate to ſatisfy the demands of thoſe from whom they had purchaſed newly inported Negroes. I my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf when I was in the Weſt Indies, knew a gentleman who purchaſed ten young Negroes at the ſale of the cargo of an African veſſel, for each of whom, he gave thirty pounds current money of the iſland of Antigua. His wife was
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:022434_0097_0FB87AFD3949CD50"/>remarkable for the tenderneſs and the care with which ſhe cauſed the new, the young, and the ſick Negroes to be nurſed upon the eſtate, yet notwithſtanding every art and expence, every one of them, excepting one, ſhortly died. The ſurvivor was a ſingularly ſine boy when he firſt was brought to the iſland, with a piercing eye and cheerful ſpirit. He, however, did not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape without a ſevere illneſs. In this method of proceeding every Negro from Africa, who is raiſed to bear the work of an eſtate, coſts the purchaſer three hundred pounds; or more, for the price of Negroes is now advanced. It is not unuſual, however, that among ten Negroes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from Africa into the Weſt-Indies not one ſhould ſurvive the ſeaſoning. It has been aſſerted by ſome that the abolition of the ſlave-trade, would cauſe the ruin of the European ſettlements, where Negroes have been uſed in the cultivation of the land, and of the ſouthern ſtates of America. It is certain, however, if the Negroes were treated with humanity, there would be no occaſion for further importations from Africa. Mr. Clarkſon, in his before-mentioned Eſſay, ſays, "In the year 1771, a gentleman, now in England, became the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of an eſtate ſituated near Montego-Bay, in the pariſh of Hanover, Jamaica. The number of ſlaves at that time upon it, amounted to two
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:022434_0098_0FB87AFF4DDC2438"/>hundred and ſeventy-ſix, all of whom had been born in the iſland. In the year 1786, after fifteen years had elapſed, the number was found the ſame: nor had any purchaſe whatever been made within that period, nor was any at the end of it neceſſary.</p>
               <p>In the year 1754, another gentleman ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an eſtate in the ſame pariſh and iſland.— It contained at that time, two hundred and thirty three ſlaves. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y this laſt account, dated in June 1786, the number appeared to have increaſed without any ſupplies from the coaſt, to three hundred and fourteen, though fourteen had been ſent to other eſtates, or manumitted.</p>
               <p>In the ſame iſland are ſix other eſtates, which have been in a ſimilar ſituation, and for the truth of which I will become accountable if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe has ſupported itſelf, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently of the ſlave trade, for twenty years, and from no other cauſe than that the owner, having thought it more to his intereſt that his ſlaves ſhould increaſe, by birth, than by purchaſe, made his arrangements accordingly.</p>

               <p>The fourth, in the pariſh of St. James, found a reſource within itſelf, and by the following means: The proprietor made it a rule to releaſe every woman from all obligation to labor, as ſoon as ſhe had a certain number of children, ſit to be put to work. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this was, that his ſlaves were conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually on the increaſe.</p>
               <p>The fifth and ſixth, ſituated in the pariſh of St. John, and vale of Guanaboa, on account of the humane diſpoſition of the overſeer, and the moderate ſhare of labour which he impoſes on the ſlaves, have no neceſſity for ſupplies.</p>
               <p>The above is an account of ſuch plantations as can be ſpecified, and proved beyond the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of refutation, to have ſubſiſted indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently of the ſlave-trade in the iſland of Jamai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. Many others are to be found there in the ſame predicament." Page 82 and 83.</p>
               <p>What has been brought about in Jamaica may be practiſed in other places. The uſe of the plough in the Weſt-Indies, would enable a
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:022434_0100_0FB87B01C4848E20"/>Planter to work his eſtate with fewer Negroes than he uſes in his preſent ſyſtem. Mr. Long, in his Hiſtory of Jamaica, ſays, "It was found that one plough uſed on an eſtate in the Pariſh of Clarendon, turned up as much ground in one day, and in a much better manner, than one hundred Negroes could perform with their hoes in the ſame time." Vol. 1, page 449. The objection that has been made to the plough in the iſland of Antigua, is that it would require more cattle upon an eſtate, and conſequently more land to be laid out in paſture. This, in many eſtates, where they have a good deal of paſture, would be no inconvenience whatever, and where they are deficient in this reſpect, the inconvenience might be remedied by planting Guinea graſs in the intervals between the cane-pieces: for the additional number of cattle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired would be very ſmall. In Jamaica they have lately thought it worth the while to enter again upon this plan of working an eſtate, and have encouraged people from England, who are acquainted with the method of managing a plough, to live upon their eſtates as overſeers, that the Negroes might be properly inſtructed. There cannot be a doubt but that with judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and with patience this new ſyſtem might be adopted with vaſt advantage.</p>

The Members of the Britiſh Legiſlature, and thoſe who are in authority among other nations of the world who carry on the ſlave-trade, if they do not endeavor by every reaſonable exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to abrogate that trade, are guilty indirectly of murder. They ſuffer murder to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by their neglect. They will anſwer, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for ſuch neglect at that dread tribunal where there will be an "Inquiſition for blood." The Privy Council in England have lately been engaged in inquiries concerning the ſlave-trade. This ſurely is highly becoming in them. If a ſingle murder is committed among a civilized people, do we not raiſe an immediate hue and cry after the ſuppoſed murderer? Is not the houſe, the city, the country, where it was done, all at once agitated? And ſhall the annual mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of an hundred thouſand, or more, innocent perſons, not excite our inquiries, and not inflame our indignation? In England petitions have been preſented to Parliament againſt the ſlave-trade by various ſects of chriſtians, and from nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous cities; and it is expected that before long an act will be paſt for its final abolition.— In America the ſtates of Rhode-Iſland and Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, to their immortal honor be it ſpoken, have led the way in this holy and glorious work.

               <p>Having now furniſhed a comparative view of the loſs ſuſtained in ſome of the trades that are carried on by the ſubjects of this country, I will venture to aſſert that if we except the ſlave-trade, all the reſt of them put together did not diſſipate more than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="104" facs="unknown:022434_0103_0FB87B07C20C3F08"/>So that the truth of my former aſſertion, "that this iniquitous trade deſtroys more, in one year, than all the other trades of Great-Britain, when put together, deſtroy in two," will but too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly appear." Page 66 and 67.</p>
               <p>Mr. Clarkſon ſays that the Captains in the ſlave-trade are generally the moſt inhuman ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants in the world; that they often cruelly beat their ſeamen for trivial or imaginary faults, and will ſometimes wantonly murder them. He ſays that he has within his poſſeſſion the moſt indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable proofs of his aſſertions.</p>
               <p>It is greatly to be lamented that mankind will not relinquiſh the trade for ſlaves with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica, and carry on a commerce for other mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

Mr. Clarkſon ſays, "It is a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious circumſtance, but it has been eſtabliſhed by the experience of many years, that continents produce the fineſt cotton, and that the larger the iſland, and of courſe the nearer they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proximate to continents, the finer is the cotton there. In the firſt claſs is reckoned the Perſian and African. In the ſecond that from the Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zils,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:022434_0105_0FB87B0CF94F7E58"/>Siam, and Surinam. In the third that from St. Domingo; and in the fourth that from the Britiſh Weſt-Inda iſlands." Page 19.— He ſays again, "I cannot cloſe my account of this article without mentioning that cotton, crimſon in the pod, is to be found in Africa. It grows principally in the Eyeo country, and is to be ſeen in many of the Whidah cloths. A ſmall ſpecimen of it was brought home in the year 1786.</p>
               <p>The value of this cotton would be great both to the importer, and manufacturer of muſlins. The former would immediately receive eight ſhillings for a pound of it, and the latter would gain conſiderably more by his ingenuity and taſte. He might work it up into the white cotton in delicate ſpots and figures, and as both would be of their natural color, no inconvenience would ariſe from waſhing." Page 20. Mr. Clark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſays that the dyes of Africa are ſuperior to thoſe in any part of the world, and that in Africa they have the moſt curious as well as the moſt valuable woods, not only for dying, but for other purpoſes.</p>
               <p>If the ſlave-trade were aboliſhed, ſettlements of great importance could be immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced in the country, for the purpoſe of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:022434_0106_0FB87B0E7AC36560"/>on a different commerce. It is ſaid that the French purchaſed, a few years ago, a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable tract of land at Cape Verd, which they now wiſh to uſe with this deſign. Preachers al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of different ſects of chriſtianity would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately repair to Africa to propagate the Goſpel, who are now, on account of the commotions and troubles which the ſlave-trade produces, diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged from the attempt.</p>
               <p>It might be advantageous to the European ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements and the ſouthern ſtates of America to aboliſh <hi>gradually</hi> the ſlavery of the Negroes which they at preſent poſſeſs, as well as to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the importation of others. Mr. Coxe, in his travels, ſays, "The generality, indeed, of the Poliſh Nobles are not inclined either to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh or give efficacy to any regulations in favor of the peaſants, whom they ſcarcely conſider as entitled to the common rights of humanity: A few Nobles, however, of benevolent hearts and enlightened underſtandings, have acted upon different principles, and have ventured upon the expedient of giving liberty to their vaſſals.— The event has ſhowed this project to be no leſs judicious than humane, no leſs friendly to their own intereſts than to the happineſs of their peaſants: for it appears that in the diſtricts, in which the new arrangement has been intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:022434_0107_0FB87B10ADED81E0"/>the population of their villages is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably increaſed, and the revenues of their eſtates augmented in a triple proportion. The firſt noble who granted freedom to his peaſants was Zamoiſki, formerly Grand-Chancellor, who in 1760, infranchiſed ſix villages in the Palati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of Maſovia.</p>
               <p>The revenues of the ſix villages ſince their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſement, have augmented in a much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er proportion than their population. In their ſtate of vaſſalage Zamoiſki was obliged, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the cuſtom of Poland, to build cottages and barns for his peaſants, and to furniſh them with ſeed, horſes, ploughs, and every implement of agriculture; ſince their attainment of liberty they are become ſo eaſy in their circumſtances, as to provide themſelves with all theſe neceſſaries at their own expence; and they likewiſe cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully pay an annual rent, in lieu of the manual labor, which their maſter formerly exacted from them. By theſe means the receipts of this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular eſtate have been nearly tripled.</p>
               <p>Upon ſigning the deed of enfranchiſement of ſix villages, their benevolent maſter intimated ſome apprehenſions to the inhabitants, leſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by their freedom, they ſhould fall into every ſpecies of licentiouſneſs, and commit more
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:022434_0108_0FB87B117ABF7D60"/>diſorders than when they were ſlaves. The ſimplicity and good ſenſe of their anſwer is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable: "When we had no other property," returned they, "than the ſtick which we hold in our hands, we were deſtitute of all encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to a right conduct, and having nothing to loſe, acted on all occaſions in an inconſiderate manner; but as ſoon as our houſes, our lands, and our cattle, are our own, the fear of forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them will be a conſtant reſtraint upon our actions." The ſincerity of this aſſertion was manifeſted by the event.</p>
               <p>The example of Zamoiſki has been followed by Chreptowitz, Vice-Chancellor of Lithuania, and the Abbe Bryzotowſki, with ſimilar ſucceſs. I was informed by a perſon who had viſited the Abbe's eſtate at Pawlowo near Vilna, that the happy countenance and comfortable air of theſe peaſants made them appear a different race of men from the wretched tenants of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring villages. The peaſants, penetrated with a ſenſe of their maſter's kindneſs, have erected at their own expence, a pillar with an inſcription expreſſive of their gratitude and affection."— Coxe's Travels into Poland, &amp;c. vol. 1, page 158, &amp;c. octavo.</p>
               <p>What has been practiſed in Poland, may in ſome meaſure be brought about in the Weſt-Indies,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:022434_0109_0FB87B1396E530D8"/>and the ſouthern ſtates of America. In theſe latter places the receipts of a man's eſtate who liberated his negroes might not be tripled, but they might be conſiderably augmented, if his Negroes were gradually liberated in a judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious manner. It is well ſaid, by the Biſhop of Cheſter, in a ſermon which was preached a few years ago in England, before the ſociety for the propagation of the Goſpel in foreign parts: "If ever then we hope to make any progreſs in our benevolent purpoſe of communicating to our Negroes the benefits and the bleſſings of religion, we muſt firſt give them ſome of the benefits and bleſſings of ſociety and of civil government. We muſt, as far as is poſſible, attach them and their families inſeparably to the ſoil, muſt give them a little intereſt in it; muſt indulge them with a few rights and privileges to be anxious for; muſt ſecure them by ſixed laws from injury and inſult; muſt inform their minds, correct their morals, accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom them to the reſtraints of legal marriage, to the care of a family, and the comforts of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic life: muſt improve and advance their condition gradually, <hi>as they are able to bear it;</hi> and even allow a certain number of the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving to work out their freedom by degrees (according to the plan ſaid to be eſtabliſhed in ſome of the Spaniſh ſettlements) as a reward of ſuperior merit and induſtry, and of an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

                        </gap>, adds "The Spaniſh regulation here alluded to is ſaid to have taken place at the Havannah, and is as follows: As ſoon as a ſlave is landed, his name, price, &amp;c. are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in a public regiſter; and the maſter is obliged by law to allow him one working day in every week to himſelf, beſides Sunday; ſo that if he chooſes to work for his maſter on that day, he receives the wages of a free-man for it; and whatever he gains by his labor on that day is ſo ſecured to him by law, that the maſter cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive him of it. As ſoon as the ſlave is able to purchaſe another working day, the maſter is obliged to ſell it him at a proportionable price, viz. one fifth part of his original coſt; and ſo likewiſe the remaining four days, at the ſame rate, as ſoon as the ſlave is able to redeem them, after which he is abſolutely free. See "Mr. Sharp's Appendix to the juſt limitation of ſlavery," &amp;c. page 53.</p>
                     <p>There is ſomething wonderfully pleaſing and benevolent in this inſtitution. It were greatly to be wiſhed that ſome expedient of this kind might be <hi>tried</hi> at leaſt as an experiment, in ſome of the Engliſh iſlands. It is believed (on very juſt grounds and after the matureſt conſideration of the ſubject) by men of great judgement and long experience in the management of Weſt-India eſtates, that if the Negroes on any of our plantations were emancipated <hi>gradually</hi> (for every improvement of their ſituation muſt be <hi>very gradual</hi>) in ſome ſuch way as is here propoſed, and retained afterwards by their owner as day-laborers at a certain fair ſtipulated price, it would be an alteration no leſs advantageous to the Planter, than kind and compaſſionate to the Negroes. Having been previouſly habituated to the climate and to hard labor, and animated at the ſame time by that ſpirit, which freedom and gratitude, and the proſpect of ſome little property never fail to inſpire, he would do three times the work of a languid, feeble, heart-broken ſlave; and the plantation would be cultivated with far leſs expence to the proprietor than the frequent purchaſe of freſh Negroes, and their maintenance in health, ſickneſs, and old age, amount to. See "Hiſtory of Jamaica," 502 and 503.</p>
                     <p>I have been informed that in the moſt flouriſhing ſtate of Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does, the ſugar-cane there was principally cultivated by hired white ſervants." Vide Biſhop of Cheſter's Sermon, pages 21, 22, 23.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Weſley, in his Thoughts upon Slavery, ſays, "white men, even Engliſhmen, are well able to labor in hot climates: provided they are temperate both in meat and drink, and inure themſelves to it by degrees. I ſpeak no more than I know by experience. It appears from the thermometer, that the ſummer heat in Georgia, is frequently equal to that in Barbadoes, yea to that under the line.— And yet I and my family (eight in number) did employ all our ſpare time there, in felling of trees and clearing of ground, as hard labor as any Negro need be employed in. The German family likewiſe, forty in number, were employed in all manner of labor. And this was ſo far from impairing our health that we all continued perfectly well, while the idle ones all round about us, were ſwept away as with a peſtilence."</p>
                  </note> That this regulation might in a great meaſure anſwer the end propoſed appears
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:022434_0111_0FB87B1779244008"/>from the memoirs of Guilma, ſuperior of the Indian Miſſion on the great river Oronoko, where he reſided thirty years. He informs us, that a great number of Negroes on the coaſt of Curacoa, where it is ſaid this regulation took place, had bought themſelves free; that of all thoſe who had been converted to chriſtianity, he had not known one, who ever turned back to his former heatheniſh practices; and that the King of Spain had not more faithful and more induſtrious ſubjects than theſe Negroes who were thus liberated. It has been obſerved that if the Negroes were liberated they would not continue in the Weſt-Indies, and the Planters would be ruined for the want of laborers to work their eſtates. If they were free they would become attached to the places where they were born, and would conſider them in every reſpect as their country. It is probable alſo, if proper laws
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:022434_0112_0FB87B1B1D2F3100"/>were made in the Weſt-Indies for the protection of the Negroes that many would go thither from England and other places.

This addreſs was printed in the London papers of July 1788.

It will be objected by ſome that the evidence, relative to the enormities in the treatment of Negroes which have been mentioned in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going chapters, ſhould be certain and unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable. In anſwer to which it may be obſerved that the evidence that may be produced is the moſt certain and unexceptionable that can be conceived. Factors, of various nations, who in different times have been in Africa, allow that that the Negroes are frequently ſtolen from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hence. They may be ſaid to give evidence againſt their intereſt. Mr. Wadſtrom, who is a man of character and rank in Sweden, went to Africa for the purpoſe of enquiring into the particulars of the ſlave-trade. He ſays that the Negroes are generally ſtolen from thence, and gives ſuch inſtances of cruelty as would melt the heart if it were <hi>fleſh</hi> and not <hi>ſtone.</hi> In this he is ſupported by the evidence of other impartial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable perſons. It is regularly proved, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the fifth chapter, in a Court of Juſtice, that the crews of ſome ſhips upon the coaſt of Africa, murdered a King, and carried his two brothers, with many other Negroes, into ſlavery. Mr. Falconbridge and Mr. Newton, whom I have mentioned in the preceding part of my work, are men of credit, and were eye witneſſes of the ſavage cruelties committed in a ſlave veſſel. What they have declared, may be coroborated
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:022434_0114_0FB87B1E185E3860"/>by the evidence of thouſands. Mr. Weſley and Mr. Ramſay, who have given long accounts of the treatment of the Negroes, were religious men, (as well as myſelf) and could be tempted by no intereſt to miſrepreſent the matter. All candid men who have an opportunity of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will ſay that we have generally ſpoken the truth. We were witneſſes of many of the facts which we write upon, and have not, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, I believe, uttered a falſehood in regard to the moſt trivial matter.</p>
               <p>I think it neceſſary to obſerve before I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that it is juſt to diſcriminate between the Planters.

In the female line I have relations in the Weſt-Indies, who are the poſſeſſors of numerous ſlaves, for whom I bear a becoming affection. I have alſo in the

In travelling through ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Weſt-India iſlands I have met the moſt liberal hoſpitality. The Planters are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times poliſhed men, with the beſt education which Europe can afford. I have known ſome to live in great ſplendor and elegance, and who diſdaining the vulgar vicious cuſtom of preſſing their gueſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Some of my relations and ſome of my friends are remarkable for the humanity with which they treat their ſlaves, and perhaps would not be unhappy if government were to adopt a rational plan for their gradual emanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation. It is not, therefore, from malice, that I give theſe Obſervations on Negro-Slavery, to the world, but from a firm, a holy, regard to truth, and a generous ſolicitude for the intereſts of the afflicted.</p>
               <p>Some injudicious perſons, in their rage againſt Negro-Slavery, are fond of repreſenting all the Planters, as men utterly deſtitute of Principles and good manners. The celebrated Dr. Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, who, though all his religious tenets may not be defenſible, is certainly, in many reſpects, an enlightened man, ſays, that the Weſt-Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans "are not themſelves aware, how much
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:022434_0116_0FB87B207AD8B668"/>their natures are debaſed, and how offenſive their behavior often is to others." In many, there may be this offenſive behavior, and whoſe natures may be much debaſed, but in other natives of the Weſt-Indies and the ſouthern ſtates of America, (I think I ſhall not be accuſed of partiality by thoſe who may properly judge of the matter) are to be found men of elegant manners and of generous ſpirits. The Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians are remarkable, as well as the natives of the ſouthern ſtates of America, for one virtue, the noble one of hoſpitality, in which many of their opponents ſhould endeavor to imitate them.— This under proper regulations is the virtue of a Chriſtian. The Apoſtle recommends to "uſe hoſpitality one to another without grudging." 1 Peter, 4; 9.</p>
               <p>It is to be lamented that in ſome of the ſtates of America, where they have in ſome degree li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated the Negroes, they have not advanced them to all the rights of men. Why, if their color is only the effect of climate, the effect of that glorious ſun which we all admire, and God hath made of one blood all nations of men, and his ſon has impartially redeemed them all, why, if theſe things are ſo, do we haughtily keep them at ſuch a diſtance from us? If theſe propoſitions are true, which I have indiſputably
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:022434_0117_0FB87B2284B736E0"/>proved in this work, which has been the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of much reading and conſideration, a Negro ſhould elect and be elected like other freemen; he ſhould be ſuffered to marry a white woman without their being perſecuted; he ſhould ſit, if he deſerves it by his morals and his manners, at the firſt of our tables; and ſhould be encouraged to ſit in religious meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, not on a bench with Negroes only, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminately with white people In ſhort, he ſhould be admiſſible to all the rights, privileges, and honors, of a white man.</p>
               <p>It is the duty of all the nations in the world who are engaged in the ſlave-trade to deſiſt from the iniquitous occupation. I am aware of the objection that would be made to a diſcontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the ſlave-trade by intereſted men. It would be ſaid that a freſh importation of Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes is abſolutely neceſſary for the carrying on a Weſt-Indian or American plantation. I am of a contrary opinion. If the ſlave-trade is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited, the owners of theſe plantations, as it has been before obſerved, can work them with the Negroes which they already poſſeſs. They would be prevented from the injury of their fortunes by the purchaſe of newly imported Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes, which experience proves to be a faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating and ruinous cuſtom to many. They
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:022434_0118_0FB87B239D726BF0"/>would alſo be induced, that they might raiſe a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient number to cultivate their property, to treat their ſlaves with more humanity. The premium, which is ſaid to be given of late of twenty ſhillings to an Overſeer, who ſhould raiſe any Negro child to one year's age upon any eſtate in Jamaica, would be offered in other places. The regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion eſtabliſhed in the Spaniſh ſettlements might be introduced, which experience has proved to be wiſe and ſalutary, and not viſionary and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial. In addition to this regulation, a Code of Laws might be enacted, and properly execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the ſecurity of various rights to the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes until the final obtainment of their free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And above all things it would be happy if the Moravians, who are ſcattered over the Weſt-Indies, were every where invited to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Negroes in the principles of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. There is generally a remarkable difference between thoſe Negroes who attend to the preaching of the Moravians, and the others. They become, when influenced by the doctrines of this reſpectable ſet of men, compoſed, and decent in their appearance. Their dreſs is cleanly, without any thing in it that is gariſh or abſurd. Their conduct alſo is induſtrious and moral. They ſteal no more, are faithful to their truſts, and are capable, frequently, of advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, conſiderably, the intereſts of their maſters.
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:022434_0119_0FB87B25B9893B98"/>From relinquiſhing alſo that promiſcuous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce between the ſexes with which the others injure themſelves, they are more healthy, live longer, and when married, raiſe more children. The ſlave-trade, however, in whatever gradual manner the Negroes may be liberated in various countries, ſhould at all events be immediately aboliſhed</p>
               <p>If the atrocious and numberleſs murders which are committed by thoſe engaged in it are not puniſhed, they muſt bring down the curſe of Heaven upon thoſe governments which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their ſubjects to perpetrate them unmoleſted. It is ſaid in ſcripture, "For blood it polluteth the land, and cannot be wiped out, but by the blood of him that ſhed it." A celebrated and pious author in a pamphlet which I before have quoted, addreſſes himſelf in a feeling and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent manner to the Captains of the veſſels en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in this trade. Theſe are the perſons who are ſaid to reap the greateſt profit from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and are, perhaps, the moſt criminal of all the parties concerned.

Then there muſt be a ſtate of retribution: a ſtate wherein the juſt GOD will reward every man according to his work. Then what reward will he render to you. O think betimes! before you drop into eternity: think how "he ſhall have judgment without mercy, that ſhewed no mercy." Are you a man? Then you ſhould have a human heart. But have you indeed? What is your heart made of? Is there no ſuch principle as compaſſion there? Do you never feel another's pain? Have you no ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy? no ſenſe of human woe? No pity for the miſerable? When you ſaw the flowing eyes, the heaving breaſts, or the bleeding ſides and tortured limbs of your fellow-creatures, was you a ſtone or a brute? Did you look upon them with the eyes of a tyger? When you ſqueezed the agonizing creatures down in the ſhip, or when you threw their poor mangled remains into the ſea, had you no relenting? Did not one tear drop from your eye, one ſigh eſcape from your breaſt? Do you feel no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting now? If you do not, you muſt go on till the meaſure of your iniquities is full. Then will the great GOD deal with you, as you have dealt with them, and require all their blood at your hands."

The Merchant, who originally contrives the deſign of ſending a veſſel to Africa for the purpoſe of buying or kidnapping Negroes, ſeems to be highly guilty. He who knew the miſchief, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the doctrine of ſcripture and reaſon, appears <hi>worthy of many ſtripes,</hi> while he who was ignorant <hi>is worthy of few.</hi> That there are ſome in a great meaſure ignorant of the evils which are practiſed in the procuring ſlaves, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially among the young Planters, and who, if they knew thoſe evils would not defend it, is reaſonable to imagine. The ſocieties therefore which have been formed for the abolition of the Slave-Trade would render an important ſervice to mankind by publiſhing the various tracts which have been written by men of talents in favor of the Negroes, and diſperſing them about the world. They ſhould ſolicit ſubſcriptions for this noble purpoſe. They ſhould endeavour to excite, in the words of the Apoſtle, "what indignation, yea what fear, yea what vehement deſire, yea what zeal, yea what revenge."</p>

Is the human form to be degraded to the brutal by this odious practiſe of ſlavery I would aſk (for I want to wake the conſcience which now ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the breaſts of theſe tyrants; I want to rouſe it, and to make it come forth "like a giant refreſhed with wine") is humanity and reaſon, and chriſtianity, and GOD, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted for ſo trivial a purpoſe?
