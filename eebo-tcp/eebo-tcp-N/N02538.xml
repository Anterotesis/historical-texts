      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Is it <hi>profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God</hi> if thou giveſt him thy Heart? No: <hi>If thou be righteous what doſt thou give Him, &amp;c?</hi> Job 35.7. The Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit is only to thy Self and Others here on earth. Indeed God is <hi>pleaſed</hi> and thou art <hi>ſaved.</hi> He is pleas'd and gratified to ſee thee ſaved. He has

Hear it and know it for thy good.</hi> And let it move thee to give thy Heart to God <hi>that his Soul may bleſs thee.</hi> It is Gods Favour and Bleſſing that makes Man happy.

               <p>THIS is an Argument of great weight alſo, though it ought to come after the other <hi>two</hi> which have been already named and urged. <hi>God</hi> is firſt, our <hi>own</hi> Souls are next, and then the Souls of <hi>Others.</hi> The whole <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Duty</hi> of man lies in theſe <hi>three</hi> Branches, our more immediate Duty to <hi>God,</hi> to our <hi>Selves</hi> and to our <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi> So our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtle</hi> have taught us; He in his <hi>Goſpel,</hi> the Other in his <hi>Epiſtle.</hi> Mat. 22.37. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul: This is the firſt and great Command. And the ſecond, is like unto it, Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf. On theſe two Commandments hang all the Law &amp; the Prophets.</hi> Tit. 2.16. <hi>For the Grace of God that bringeth Salvation hath appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all Men, teaching us to live ſober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, righteouſly and godly in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent World.</hi> Young People are not

                  <hi>righteous toward Men,</hi> no more than <hi>godly before God,</hi> unleſs they give themſelves unto God. If they give their Hearts unto the ways of God they are <hi>dutiful</hi> to Him, they are <hi>wiſe</hi> for themſelves, and will be but <hi>juſt</hi> &amp; righteous to others. God has ſet us all in mutual <hi>Relations</hi> one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward another, and there are the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of thoſe Relations to be diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and <hi>pure Religion before God</hi> and <hi>Piety toward Men</hi> lies in the diſcharge of thoſe Duties. And <hi>young People</hi> ſtand in various Relations to one and another as much as their <hi>Elders;</hi> and are as much bound by the Law of God to render unto all the Duties of theſe Relations, as Others are: All <hi>Souls</hi> are Gods to obey him, and the <hi>Law</hi> of God binds all Souls alike to their particular Duties; even the ſoul of the <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Daughter</hi> as much as the ſoul of the <hi>Parent.</hi> Therefore young People cannot be <hi>Religious</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, if they be not <hi>Righteous</hi> and dutiful toward all that they ſtand <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated</hi> unto; whether in a nearer or

And the Glory of God from them, and their own Happineſs and Comfort in their Obedience to God, depends upon their doing their Duty to Others, in their ſeveral places and Relations.—God has ſent us into the World to do <hi>good</hi> in it, to do good to <hi>all</hi> about us, to be Bleſſings to them among whom we live, to whom we are related, with whom we have Converſation and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.

               <p>I ſay therefore again, <hi>Young People owe this to Others,</hi> to the World they live in, to thoſe they are more nearly related to, and unto all about them that they give their Hearts unto God. — And to be particular, and to begin where Nature and my Text teaches me to begin,</p>

But the living <hi>Soul</hi> or <hi>Spirit</hi> which God breathed into this Body, bears the Image of the wiſe, eternal ever living SPIRIT, whoſe breath it is. God is the <hi>Father of Spirits.</hi> Angels and Souls, intelligent and immortal Beings, are his <hi>Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring;</hi> and not Bodies. <hi>There is a Spirit in Man, and the Inſpiration of the Almighty giveth him Underſtanding. Souls are His, all</hi> Souls are ſo; his Offspring in his Image.</p>
               <p>AND this is the manner of Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in our <hi>Context;</hi> that it is abſurd to worſhip the inviſible and immenſe.

               </p>
               <p n="3">3. IT muſt moreover be premiſed &amp; conſidered, That <hi>Angels</hi> and humane <hi>Souls,</hi> though vaſtly in their Nature excelling Bodies and bearing the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Inviſible God; yet they are as much at laſt the <hi>Creatures</hi> of God and infinitely <hi>below</hi> Him, as any and every part of the inferior World. At laſt the diſtance is infinite be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and the higheſt created Intelligence. There is no propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between Finite and Infinite: there is no meaſuring that which is Eternal and which is Immenſe. An eternal Exiſtence is juſt the ſame to a million Years before the World, as to a million after it: And ſo is an immenſe Preſence juſt the ſame to the Heaven of heavens and to this Houſe which we are in. That is to ſay, There is neither greater not leſs if compared to Infinity: the Heaven of heavens do no more contain God than this Room can. In like manner the higheſt created Beings are but
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:003010_0049_0FEF9DD6C80851F8"/>Creatures, and the leaſt Worm or Mire is one of Gods Creatures. If therefore ſome of God's Creatures are call'd his Offspring, what then? they are never the leſs as much below the eternal and immenſe <hi>Creator,</hi> as the leaſt and loweſt thing that he has made. Wherefore <hi>He putteth no Truſt in his Angels, he charge them with Folly, they cover their Faces before Him; the Heavens are not clean in his ſight.</hi> And as for the Spirits in Fleſh, what are they but <hi>Duſt and Aſhes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Him? as <hi>Abraham</hi> beheld him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when God ſpake to him, and gave him leave to ſpeak before him. — As our <hi>Context</hi> has it, — <hi>God that made the World and all things in it, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he is Lord of Heaven and Earth,</hi> is as much above the higheſt as the leaſt of his Creatures. So then, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though our Souls are the <hi>Offspring</hi> of God, yet pride muſt be hid from Man, and he is before his Maker but a Worm of the duſt. <hi>Lucifer,</hi> the Son of the Morning, in his high ſtate
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:003010_0050_0FEF961120DF5438"/>grew proud, not conſidering that his diſtance from the Throne of the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty on High,</hi> was as great as if he had been the leaſt of Angels or only a Spirit here below in fleſh; and ſo he fell —. But having ſaid <hi>this</hi> to keep us low under the Priviledges of our Nature and the Favours of God to us; I come now to ſay,</p>
               <p n="4">4. YET it pleaſes the High God to <hi>call</hi> ſome of his Creatures <hi>his Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring,</hi> and to require them ſo to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of &amp; eſteem Themſelves. <hi>For we are his Offspring.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ANGELS and Men may ſay this. They <hi>both</hi> are ſo. God calls them ſo, owns them ſo, puts them among his Children.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>ANGELS</hi> are the <hi>Sons</hi> of God. Job 38.7. <hi>When the Morning Stars ſang together and all the Sons of God ſhouted for Joy.</hi> i. e. The Angels did ſo when God made this Earth of ours. The bleſſed Angels are among Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the <hi>Firſt born of the Father of lights;</hi> and they ſhone bright in the <hi>Morning</hi> of time; before that God
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:003010_0050_0FEF961120DF5438"/>commanded <hi>the Light to ſhine out of Darkneſs</hi> here below. They ſaw God rear the Earth for Men their younger <hi>Brethren,</hi> immortal Spirits like themſelves; and they rejoiced at it; (in the habitable parts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the <hi>Son</hi> of God was before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing.) The holy <hi>Angels</hi> ſhine bright in the <hi>Image</hi> of God; love him as their <hi>Father,</hi> he delights in them as his <hi>Sons,</hi> their delight is to do his <hi>Will,</hi> they dwell in his <hi>Houſe</hi> above, and they inherit everlaſting Life and Light.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>MAN</hi> was created a <hi>Son</hi> of God as well as the Angels. So we read, Luk. 3. ult. <hi>Adam, which was the Son of God. He</hi> was immediately the Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of God in his Creation; <hi>We</hi> are mediately, Deut. 32.6. <hi>Is he not thy Father? hath he not made thee?</hi> Mal. 2.10. <hi>Have we not all our Father? hath not one God created us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now there are two Reaſons why Angels and men ſhould be called the <hi>Offspring</hi> of God, more than the other

               </p>
               <p n="1">I. ANGELS and Men are the <hi>Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring</hi> of God becauſe they are made more in the <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Likeneſs</hi> of God than the inferior Creatures are. This is the Diſtinction that God put, and the Difference he made, in the Creation of other Creatures and of Man: <hi>Let us make Man</hi> (ſaid He) <hi>in our Image and likeneſs.</hi> Which means not that the inferior Creatures do not bear the manifeſt ſtamp of God's Wiſdom, Power and Goodneſs upon them; They evidently do ſo, and <hi>His eternal Power and Godhead are clearly ſeen in the things which are made.</hi> But in Man there is the Image of God's Spirituality, Dominion and Government, Knowledge, Rectitude,

               <p>So,</p>
               <p n="1">1. WE bear the <hi>Image</hi> and are the <hi>Offspring</hi> of God becauſe we are <hi>liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Souls and Spirits.

The eternal and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Mind; inviſible, incorporeal, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material, incorruptible; that is GOD. <hi>Material</hi> and viſible things cannot give us any Image of God, like things <hi>Spiritual</hi> which only fall under the diſcerning of our Minds, which are Spirits, and capable of Spiritual O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations. In his we are like <hi>God,</hi> that our Souls are Spiritual Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; that there is a <hi>Spirit in Man;</hi> inviſible, incorruptible, immortal; a

               <p n="2">2. We bear the <hi>Image</hi> and are the <hi>Offspring</hi> of God becauſe <hi>intelligent and rational</hi> Creatures.

In <hi>this</hi> we muſt needs ſee &amp; conſider the Image of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. Job. 35.10. <hi>Where is God my Maker, who teacheth us more than the Beaſts of the field, and hath made us wiſer than the Fowls of Heaven?</hi> The <hi>LORD is a God of Knowledge;</hi> Angels bear his Image in their Knowledge and Wiſdom, and ſo doth Man on

               <p n="3">3 WE bear the <hi>Image</hi> and are the <hi>Offspring</hi> of God, in our <hi>Will, Freedom, Election and Choice,</hi> in our Actions. We are Agents by Counſel. We judge, deliberate, adviſe, chuſe o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="6">6. ARE we the <hi>Offspring</hi> of God? ſee how <hi>the Grace of God by Jeſus Chriſt, as revealed in the Goſpel; agrees both to the Original and lapſed State of Man as it is given us by Moſes.</hi> There is an admirable Harmony between the <hi>Two Teſtaments,</hi> the <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>New;</hi> And they give in a marvellous Light, and bear a ſtrong Teſtimony, the one to the other.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>THE redeeming Mercy of God by Chriſt admirably agrees to the Doctrine of mans Original State;</hi> that he was made in the Likeneſs of God, and in his Love, and perfectly good &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and in ſhort a <hi>Son</hi> of God. For what is it that Chriſt by the Goſpel propoſes, but to recover us into the Favour and Grace of God; and into the Relation, D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="146" facs="unknown:003010_0075_0FEF9E21093F0CD8"/>of Children to God. For the whole Deſign and Scope of the Goſpel is to make us again the <hi>Children</hi> of God. <hi>This</hi> it propoſes to us, the Way to this it reveals to us, and in its ſaving Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy this it produces in us and for us. It reveals to us a gracious Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Chriſt, a bleſſed Way for our Reconciliation to God, by a bleſſed Regeneration and Renovation paſſing on us. It tells us of our being <hi>born again, renewed after the Image of God in Knowledge and Holineſs;</hi> it ſhews and teaches the Spirit and Diſpoſition of Children which God is ready to reſtore in us. It would beget in us the Love of Children to God, &amp; bring us into the ready Obedience of Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and it would bring us into the Communion of Children with God; to be known of God, and lov'd by him; to converſe with him, hear his voice, ſpeak to him, walk before him, &amp; live with him for ever and ever. — Thus on the one hand <hi>the Doctrines</hi> of <hi>Goſpel Grace</hi> agree unto the Account given
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:003010_0075_0FEF9E21093F0CD8"/>us of the <hi>Original State of Man;</hi> that he was made a <hi>Son</hi> in the Image and Love of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT agrees alſo to the Account given us of <hi>Mans Fall and of his lapſed State;</hi> in being a Doctrine &amp; Precept of <hi>Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR if Man be the <hi>Offspring of</hi> God, and be <hi>fallen</hi> from <hi>God,</hi> it muſt needs be that the way of his Recovery and Return to God be by an ingenuous and deep Repentance: And if God be a <hi>Father</hi> to Man by Nature, as his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and he will pleaſe to become his Father again by <hi>Grace</hi> after his Sin and Fall, we may be aſſured then of the Sinning Creatures Reception and Pardon upon his Repentance. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the Goſpel addreſſes unto lapſed Man.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT invites and calls him to <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> And 2. It aſſures him of Gods <hi>Pardoning Mercy</hi> upon his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. A <hi>Penitential Return</hi> to God is the leaſt that can be enjoyned on the <hi>Sinning Offspring;</hi> and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:003010_0076_0FEF9E247AD789A0"/>which the Goſpel requires is a <hi>filial</hi> Repentance, ſuch as becomes Children to an offended Father: A filial Fear and Shame and Sorrow. So our <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> has repreſented it in the Parable of the <hi>Prodigal; Luk.</hi> 15 The Sinner is a <hi>Son</hi> that has left the Houſe of a tender and loving <hi>Father,</hi> and acted ſhamefully to his great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence and Diſhonour; yet at laſt pinch'd with his <hi>Needs</hi> and with the Senſe of his miſerable and loſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, he bethinks himſelf of his Sin and Folly, and reſolves to <hi>ariſe and go to his Father,</hi> confeſs his Fault and beg Forgiveneſs and caſt himſelf upon his Pity: — <hi>I will ſay unto Him, Father I have ſinned againſt Heaven and Thee.</hi> You ſee then that <hi>Evangelical Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> is the Holy Sorrow of a fallen <hi>Offspring</hi> in a penitential Return to an offended God and <hi>Father.</hi> — And it muſt be added, The Goſpel aſſures the <hi>Penitent</hi> of ſuch a Reception from God as an offending Child may look for from a Father upon his Repentance. God pardons like a <hi>Father,</hi> freely,
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:003010_0076_0FEF9E247AD789A0"/>fully and for ever; and moſt tenderly and affectionately. So the Parable repreſents the <hi>Prodigals</hi> Reception; <hi>While he was yet a great way off the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſaw him, and ran, and ſell on his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p>UPON all then we ſee the <hi>Harmony</hi> of the Doctrines and Laws of Chriſt, with the Original and lapſed State of Man. Man was at firſt a <hi>holy Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring,</hi> now he is a <hi>ſinning</hi> one; and our Holy <hi>Saviour</hi> brings him by <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> back to his Father, into his Heart and Arms again. The <hi>Sin</hi> of Man is the Sin of a <hi>Son</hi> againſt his Father; the <hi>Repentance</hi> which the
