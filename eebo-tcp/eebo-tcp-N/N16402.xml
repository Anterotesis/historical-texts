         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>REV. AND DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WITH the moſt affectionate gratitude and reſpect, I beg leave to preſent you a book, which owes its exiſtence to your requeſt, its copiouſneſs to your plan, and much of its perſpicuity to your review, and to the uſe I made of your remarks on that part of it, which your health and leiſure would permit you to examine. I addreſs it to you, not to beg your patronage to it, for of that I am already well aſſured; and much leſs from any ambition of attempting your character, for which, if I were more, equal to the ſubject, I ſhould think this a very improper place: but chiefly, from a ſecret delight which I find in the thought of being known to thoſe whom this may reach, as one whom you have honored, not only with your friendſhip, but with ſo much of your eſteem and approbation too, as muſt ſubſtantially appear in your committing a work to me, which you had your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf projected as one of the moſt conſiderable ſervices of your life.</p>
            <p>I have long thought the love of popular applauſe a meanneſs, which a philoſophy far inferior to that of our divine Maſter might have taught us to conquer; but to be eſteemed by eminently great and good men, to whom we are intimately known, appears to me, not only one of the moſt ſolid atteſtations of ſome real worth, but, next to the approbation of God and our own conſciences, one of its moſt valuable rewards. It will, I doubt not, be found ſo in that world, to which ſpirits like yours are tending, and for which, through divine grace, you have obtained ſo uncommon a degree of ripeneſs. And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me, Sir, while I write this, to refreſh myſelf with the hope, that when that union of hearts, which has ſo long ſubſiſted between us ſhall arive to its full maturity and endearment there, it will be matter of mutual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to recollect, that you have aſſigned me, and that I have in ſome degree executed a taſk, which may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, under the bleſſing of God, awaken and improve re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſentiments in the minds of thoſe whom we leave
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:021060_0003_0FB20F472C00C540"/>
behind us, and of others who may ariſe after us in this vain, tranſitory, enſnaring world.</p>
            <p>Such is the improvement you have made of your ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities for ſervice, that I am fully perſuaded heave<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> join with all who wiſh well to the Chriſtian intereſt among us in acknowledging the goodneſs of Providence to you and to the Church of Chriſt, in prolonging a life, at once ſo valuable and ſo tender, to ſuch an advanced pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod. With them, Sir, I rejoice, that God hath given you to poſſeſs, in ſo extraordinary a degree, not only the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of intending great benefit to the world, but the ſatisfaction of having effected it, and of ſeeing ſuch an harveſt already ſpringing up, I hope as an earneſt of a much more copious increaſe from thence. With multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes more I bleſs God, that you are not, in this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſo afflicted, and yet ſo laborious a day, rendered entirely incapable of ſerving the public from the preſs, and from the pulpit; and that amidſt the pain which your active ſpirit feels, when theſe pleaſing ſervices ſuffer long interruptions from bodily weakneſs, it may be ſo ſingularly refreſhed by reflecting on that ſphere of extenſive uſefulneſs, in which by your writings you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually move.</p>
            <p>I congratulate you, dear Sir, that, while you are in a multitude of families and ſchools of the lower claſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending to the humble, yet important work, of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infant-minds to the firſt rudiments of religious knowledge and devout impreſſions, by your various Chatechiſms and divine Songs, you are alſo daily reading Lectures on Logic, and other branches of philoſophy, to ſtudious youth; and this not only in private academies, but in the moſt public and celebrated ſeats of learning; not merely in Scotland, and in our American colonies, (where, from ſome peculiar conſiderations, it might moſt naturally be expected;) but through the amiable candour of ſome excellent men and accompliſhed tutors in our Engliſh univerſities too. I congratulate you, that you are teaching, no doubt hundreds of miniſters, and
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:021060_0004_0FB20F48B7D35608"/>

               </gap>ally by your Pſalms and your Hymns, you are leading the worſhip, and, I truſt, alſo animating the devotion, of myriads, in our public aſſemblies every ſabbath, and in their families or cloſets every day. This, Sir, at leaſt, ſo far as it relates to the ſervice of the ſanctuary, is an unparalleled favour, by which God hath been pleaſed to diſtinguiſh you, I may boldly ſay it, beyond any of his ſervants now upon earth. Well may it be eſteemed a glorious equivalent, and indeed much more than equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for all thoſe views of eccleſiaſtical preferment, to which ſuch talents, learning, virtues and intereſt, might have entitled you in an eſtabliſhment; and I doubt not, but you joyfully accept it as ſuch.</p>
            <p>Nor is it eaſy to conceive in what circumſtances you could, on any ſuppoſition, have been eaſier and happier, than in that pious and truly honorable family, in which as I verily believe, in ſpecial indulgence both to you and it, Providence has been pleaſed to appoint that you ſhould ſpend ſo conſiderable a part of your life. It is my earneſt prayer, that all the remainder of it may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene, uſeful, and pleaſant. And as, to my certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, your compoſitions have been the ſingular comfort of many excellent Chriſtians (ſome of them numbered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong my deareſt friends) on their dying bed: for I have heard ſtanzas of them repeated from the lips of ſeveral, who were doubtleſs in a few hours to begin the Song of Moſes and the Lamb; ſo I hope and truſt, that when God ſhall call you to that ſalvation, for which your faith and patience hath ſo long been waiting, he will ſhed around you the choiceſt beams of his favour, and gladden your heart with conſolations, like thoſe which you have been the happy inſtrument of adminiſtering to others.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, Sir, be aſſured, that I am not a little animated in the various labours to which Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has called me, by reflecting, that I have ſuch a contemporary, and eſpecially ſuch a friend; whoſe
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:021060_0005_0FB20F4C3A3D7450"/>
ſingle preſence would be to me as that of a cloud of wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes here below, to awaken my alacrity in the race that is ſet before me. And, I am perſuaded, that whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> I ſay this, I ſpeak the ſentiments of many of my br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> heart ſo generous as yours, to the delay of that exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eternal weight of glory, which is now ſo nearly approaching. Yes, my honoured Friend, you will, I hope, chearfully endure a little longer continuance in life amidſt all its infirmities; from an aſſurance, that while God is pleaſed to maintain the exerciſe of your reaſon, it is hardly poſſible that you ſhould live in vain, to the world, or yourſelf. Every day, and every trial, is brightening your crown, and rendering you ſtill more meet for an inheritance among the ſaints in light. Every word that you drop from the pulpit has now, ſurely, its peculiar weight: the eyes of many are on their aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prophet, eagerly intent that they may catch, if not his mantle, at leaſt ſome divine ſentence from his lips, which may long guide their ways, and warm their hearts. This ſolicitude your friends bring into thoſe happy moments in which they are favoured with your converſe in private: and when you are retired from them, your prayers, I doubt not, largely contribute to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards guarding your country, watering the church, and bleſſing the world. Long may they continue to anſwer theſe great ends! And permit me, Sir, to conclude, with expreſſing my chearful confidence, that in thoſe beſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments you are often particularly mindful of one, who ſo highly eſteems, ſo greatly needs, and ſo warmly returns, that remembrance, as,</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE ſeveral hints given me in the Dedication, and the firſt chapter of this Treatiſe, which contains a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ticular plan of the deſign, render it unneceſſary to introduce it with a long preface. Some of my readers may perhaps remember, that, ſeveral years ago, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed this work to the Public, in the preface to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond edition of my ſermons <hi>on the power and grace of Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. My much honoured friend Dr. WATTS had laid the ſcheme, eſpecially of the former part. But as thoſe indiſpoſitions, with which (to the unſpeakable grief of the churches) God has been pleaſed to exerciſe him, had forbid his hopes of being able to add <hi>this</hi> to his many <hi>labours of love</hi> to immortal ſouls, he was pleaſed, in a very affectionate and importunate manner, to urge me to undertake it. And I bleſs GOD, with my whole heart, not only that he hath carried me through this delightful taſk (for ſuch indeed I have found it) but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo that he hath ſpared that worthy and amiable perſon to ſee it accompliſhed, and given him ſtrength and ſpirit to review ſo conſiderable a part of it. His appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation expreſſed in ſtronger terms than modeſty will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to repeat, encourages me to hope that it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted in ſuch a manner as may, by the divine bleſſing, render it of ſome general ſervice. And I the rather hope it will be ſo, as it now comes abroad into the world, not only with my own prayers and his, but alſo with thoſe of many other pious friends, which I have been particularly careful to engage for its ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Into whatever hands this work may come, I muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire that, before any paſs their judgment, they would pleaſe to read it through, that they may diſcern the connection between one part of it and another. Which I the rather requeſt, becauſe I have long obſerved, that Chriſtians of different parties have been eagerly laying hold on particular parts of the ſyſtem of divine truths, and have been contending about them; as if each had been all; or, as if the ſeparation of the members from each other, and from the head, were the preſervation of the body inſtead of its deſtruction. They have been
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:021060_0007_0FB20F4F8E8262D0"/>
zealous to eſpouſe the defence, and to maintain the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and uſefulneſs of each apart; whereas their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour as well as uſefulneſs, ſeems to me to lie much in their connection: and ſuſpicions have often ariſen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the reſpective defenders of each, which have a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>peared as unreaſonable and abſurd, as if all the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for ſecuring one part of a ſhip in a ſtorm were to be cenſured as a contrivance to ſink the reſt. I pray God to give to <hi>all his miniſters</hi> and <hi>people</hi> more and more of <hi>the ſpirit of wiſdom,</hi> and of <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>of a ſound mind;</hi> and to remove far from us thoſe mutual jealouſies and animoſities, which hinder our acting with that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animity, which is neceſſary in order to the ſucceſsful carrying on our common warfare againſt the enemies of Chriſtianity. We may be ſure theſe enemies will never fail to make their own advantage of our multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied diviſions and ſevere conteſts with each other. But they muſt neceſſarily loſe both their ground and their influence, in proportion to the degree in which the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nergy of Chriſtian principles is felt, to unite and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the hearts of thoſe by whom they are profeſſed.</p>
            <p>I take this opportunity of adding, that as this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe may be looked upon as the ſequel of my <hi>ſermons on Regeneration,</hi> though in ſomething of a different method, a ſecond edition of thoſe ſermons is now publiſhed (in compliance with the requeſt of many of my friends) in the ſame form and ſize with this book. I have been ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to make them both as cheap as poſſible, that I may fall in with the charitable deſigns of thoſe who may purpoſe to give them away. There is, however, an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of this treatiſe in octavo, for ſuch as rather chuſe to have it in a larger character and fairer form.</p>
            <p>I have ſtudied the greateſt plainneſs of ſpeech, that the loweſt of my readers may, if poſſible, be able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand every word; and, I hope, perſons of a more elegant taſte and refined education, will pardon what appeared to me ſo neceſſary a piece of charity. Such a care in practical writers, ſeems one important inſtance of that honouring all men, which our amiable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending religion teaches; and I have been particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly obliged to my worthy patron, for what he hath done to ſhorten ſome of the ſentences, and to put my
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:021060_0008_0FB20F50D5A22D70"/>
meaning into plainer and more familiar words. Yet, I dare ſay, the world will not ſuſpect it of having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted any impropriety or inelegance of language by paſſing through the hands of Dr. WATTS.</p>
            <p>I muſt add one remark here, which I heartily wiſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> not omitted in the firſt edition, viz. That though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> do in this book conſider my reader as ſucceſſively in a great variety of ſuppoſed circumſtances, beginning with thoſe of <hi>a thoughtleſs ſinner,</hi> and leading him through ſeveral ſtages of conviction, terror, <hi>&amp;c</hi> as what may be previous to his ſincerely accepting the goſpel, and devoting himſelf to the ſervice of; yet I would by no means be thought to inſinuate, that every one who is brought to that happy reſolution, arrives at it through thoſe particular ſteps or feels agitations of mind equal, in any degree, to thoſe I have deſcribed. Some ſenſe of ſin, and ſome ſerious and humbling apprehenſion of our danger and miſery in conſequence of it, muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be neceſſary, to diſpoſe us to receive the grace of the goſpel, and the Saviour who is there exhibited to our faith: but God is pleaſed ſometimes to begin the work of his grace on the heart almoſt from the firſt dawning of reaſon, and to carry it on by ſuch gentle and inſenſible degrees, that very excellent perſons, who have made the moſt eminent attainments in the divine life, have been unable to recount any remarkable hiſtory of their converſion. And, ſo far as I can learn, this is moſt frequently the caſe with thoſe of them who have enjoyed the benefits of a pious education, when it has not been ſucceeded by a vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ious and licentious youth. God forbid, therefore, that any ſhould be ſo inſenſible of their own happineſs as to fall into perplexity with relation to their ſpiritual ſtate, for want of being able to trace ſuch a riſe of religion in their minds as it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, on my plan, for me to deſcribe and exemplify here.—I have ſpoken my ſentiments on this head ſo fully in the VIIIth of my <hi>ſermons on Regeneration,</hi> that I think none who has read, and remembers the general contents of it, can be in danger of miſtaking my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here. But as it is very poſſible this book may fall into the hands of many who have not read the other, and have no opportunity of conſulting it, I thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:021060_0009_0FB20F54647E6070"/>
to inſert this caution in the preface to this; and I am much obliged to that worthy and excellent perſon who kindly reminded me of the expediency of doing it.</p>
            <p>I conclude, with deſiring my friends to forgive the neceſſary interruption which this work has given to the <hi>third volume</hi> of my <hi>Family Expoſitor,</hi> which I am now ſending to the preſs as faſt as I can, and hope to publiſh in leſs than a year. To this volume I have referred ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>additional notes,</hi> and the <hi>indexes,</hi> which are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to render the former volumes complete; having determined to add nothing to the ſecond edition which ſhould depreciate the former. I do not think it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to trouble my friends with a new ſubſcription, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it for granted, that few who were pleaſed with the other part of the work, will fail of perfecting the ſet on the <hi>hiſtorical books</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament.</hi> When my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition on the <hi>epiſtolary part</hi> may be completed, God only knows. I will proceed in it as faſt as the other duties of my ſtation will permit; and I earneſtly beg, that if my readers find edification and advantage by any of my writings, they would in return offer a prayer for me, that God may carry me on, in that <hi>moſt important labour of my pen,</hi> under the remarkable tokens of his guidance and bleſſing.</p>

                  <p>That true religion is very rare, appears from comparing the nature of it with the lives and characters of men around us, § <hi>1, 2.</hi> The want of it is matter of juſt lamentation, § <hi>3.</hi> To remedy this evil is the deſign of the enſuing treatiſe, § <hi>4.</hi> To which, therefore, the author earneſtly beſpeaks the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the reader, as his own heart is deeply intereſted in it, § <hi>5, 6.</hi> A general plan of the work; of which the fifteen firſt chapters relate chiefly to the <hi>RISE</hi> of Religion, and the remaining chapters to its <hi>PROGRESS, § 7.—12.</hi> The chapter concludes with a prayer for the ſucceſs of the work.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§ 1. WHEN we look round about us with an attentive eye, and conſider the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters and purſuits of men, we plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee, that though, in the original conſtitution of their natures, they only, of all the creatures that dwell on the face of the earth, be capable of religion, yet many of them ſhamefully neglect it. And whatever diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent notions people may entertain of what they call re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, all muſt agree in owning, that it is very far from being an univerſal thing.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. Religion, in its moſt general view, is ſuch a ſenſe of God on the ſoul, and ſuch a conviction of our obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to him, and of our dependance upon him, as ſhall engage us to make it our great care to conduct ourſelves in a manner which we have reaſon to believe will be
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:021060_0015_0FB20F5FD59F37A0"/>
pleaſing to him. Now, when we have given this plain account of religion, it is by no means neceſſary that we ſhould ſearch among the ſavages of the African or Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican nations, to find inſtances of thoſe who are ſtrangers to it. When we view the conduct of the generality of people at home, in a Chriſtian and Proteſtant nation, in a nation whoſe obligations to God have been ſingular, almoſt beyond thoſe of any other people under Heaven, will any one preſume to ſay, that religion has an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal reign among us? will any one ſuppoſe that it prevails in every life? that it reigns in every heart? alas! the avowed infidelity, the profanation of the name and day of God, the drunkenneſs, the lewdneſs, the injuſtice the falſehood, the pride, the prodigality, the baſe ſelfiſhneſs, the ſtupid inſenſibility of the ſpiritual and eternal inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of themſelves and others, which ſo generally appear among us, loudly proclaim the contrary. So that one would imagine, upon this view, that thouſands and ten thouſands thought the neglect and even the contempt, of religion were a glory rather than a reproach. And where is the neighbourhood, where is the ſociety, where is the happy family, (conſiſting of any conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,) in which, on a more exact examination, we find reaſon to ſay, "Religion fills even this little circle?" There is, perhaps, a freedom from any groſs and ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous immoralities, an external decency of behaviour, an attendance on the outward forms of worſhip in public, and (here and there) in the family; yet amidſt all this, there is nothing which looks like the genuine actings of the ſpiritual and divine life. There is no appearance of love to God, no reverence for his preſence, no deſire of his favour as the higheſt good: there is no cordial belief of the goſpel of ſalvation; no eager ſolicitude to eſcape that condemnation which we have incurred by ſin; no hearty concern to ſecure that eternal life which Chriſt has purchaſed and ſecured for his people, and which he freely promiſes to all who will receive him. Alas! whatever the love of a friend, or ever of a parent, can do: whatever inclination there may <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> to hope all things, and believe all things, the moſt favourable; evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:021060_0016_0FB20F64E8429848"/>
to the contrary will force itſelf upon the mind, and extort the unwilling concluſion, that, whatever elſe may be amiable in this dear friend, in that favourite child, "religion dwells not in its breaſt."</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. To a heart that firmly believes the goſpel, and views perſons and things in the light of eternity, this is one of the moſt mournful conſiderations in the world. And indeed, to ſuch a one, all the other calamities and evils of human nature appears trifles when compared with this, the abſence of real religion, and that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety to it, which reigns in ſo many thouſands of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Let this be cured, and all the other evils will eaſily be borne; nay, good will be extracted out of them: but if this continue, it "bringeth forth fruit unto death<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Rom. vii. 5.</note>;" and in conſequence of it, multitudes, who ſhare the entertainments of an indulgent Providence with us, and are at leaſt allied to us by the bond of the ſame common nature, muſt, in a few years, be ſwept away into "utter deſtruction," and be plunged beyond redemption "into everlaſting burnings."</p>
               <p n="4">§ 4. I doubt not but that there are many, under thoſe various forms of religious profeſſion, which have ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily divided us in this nation, who are not only la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting this in public, if their office in life calls them to an opportunity of doing it, but are likewiſe mourning before God in ſecret, under a ſenſe of this ſad ſtate of things; and who can appeal to him that ſearches all hearts, as to the ſincerity of their deſires to revive the languiſhing cauſe of vital Chriſtianity and ſubſtantial piety, and, among the reſt, the author of this treatiſe, may with confidence, ſay, it is this which animates him to the preſent attempt, in the midſt of ſo many other cares and labours; for this, he is willing to lay aſide many of thoſe curious amuſements in ſcience which might ſuit his own private taſte, and perhaps open a way to ſome reputation in the learned world: for this, he is willing to wave the laboured ornaments of ſpeech, that he may, if poſſible, deſcend to the capacity of the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:021060_0017_0FB20F669AD98130"/>
loweſt part of mankind: for this, he would endeavour to convince the judgment, and to reach the heart, of every reader: and in a word, for this, without any dread of the name of an Enthuſiaſt, whoever may at random throw it out upon the occaſion, he would, as it were, enter with you into your cloſet from day to day, and with all plainneſs and freedom, as well as ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, would diſcourſe to you of the great things which he has learnt from the Chriſtian revelation, and on which he aſſuredly knows your everlaſting happineſs to depend: that if you hitherto have lived without religion, you may now be awakened to the conſideration of it, and may be inſtructed in its nature and importance; or that, if you are already, through divine grace, experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally acquainted with it, you may be aſſiſted to make a greater progreſs.</p>
               <p n="5">§ 5. But he earneſtly intreats this favor of you, that, as it is plainly a ſerious buſineſs we are entering upon, you would be pleaſed to give him a ſerious and an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive hearing. He intreats that theſe addreſſes, and theſe meditations, may be peruſed at leiſure, and be thought over in retirement; and that you would do him and yourſelf the juſtice to believe the repreſentations which are here made, and the warnings which are here given, to proceed from ſincerity and love; from an heart which would not deſignedly give one moment's unneceſſary pain to the meaneſt creature on the face of the earth, and much leſs to any human mind. If he be importunate, it is, becauſe he at leaſt imagines that there is juſt reaſon for it; and fears, leaſt amidſt the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes who are undone by the utter neglect of religion, and among thoſe who are greatly damaged for want of a more reſolute and conſtant attendance to it: this may be the caſe of ſome into whoſe hands this treatiſe may fall.</p>
               <p n="6">§ 6. He is a barbarian, and deſerve, not to be called a man, who can look on the ſorrows of his fellow-creatures without drawing out his ſoul unto them, and wiſhing, at leaſt, that it were in the power of his hand to help them. Surely earth would be in Heaven to that man
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:021060_0018_0FB20F68202ED4A0"/>
who could go about from place to place, ſcattering hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs whereſoever he came, though it were only the body that he were capable of relieving, and though he could impart nothing better than the happineſs of a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal life. But the happineſs riſes in proportion to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and degree of the good which he imparts. Happy, are we ready to ſay, were thoſe honored ſervants of Chriſt, who in the early days of his church, were the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent and ſympathiſing inſtruments of conveying mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous healing to thoſe whoſe caſes ſeemed deſperate; who poured in upon the blind and the deaf the pleaſures of light and ſound, and called up the dead to the powers of action and enjoyment. But this is an honor and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which it is not fit for God commonly to beſtow on mortal men. Yet there have been in every age, and, bleſſed be his name, there ſtill are thoſe, whom he has condeſcended to make his inſtruments in conveying nobler and more laſting bleſſings than theſe to their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures. Death hath long ſince veiled the eyes and ſtopped the ears of thoſe who were the ſubjects of miraculous healing, and recovered its empire over thoſe who were once recalled from the grave. But the ſouls who were prevailed on to receive the goſpel live for ever. God has owned the labours of his faithful miniſters in every age to produce theſe bleſſed effects; and ſome of them being dead, yet ſpeaketh<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Heb. xi. 4.</note> with power and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in this important cauſe. Wonder not then if, living and dying, I be ambitious of this honor; and if "my mouth be freely opened," where I can truly ſay, "My heart is enlarged<note n="(c)" place="bottom">2 Cor. vi. 11.</note>."</p>
               <p n="7">§ 7. Informing my general plan, I have been ſolicitous that this little treatiſe might, if poſſible, be uſeful to all its readers, and contain ſomething ſuitable to each. I will therefore take the man, and the Chriſtian, in a great variety of circumſtances. I will firſt ſuppoſe myſelf ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing to one of the vaſt number of thoughtleſs crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, who have hitherto been utterly unconcerned about religion; and will try what can be done, by all plainneſs and earneſtneſs of addreſs, to awaken him from this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021060_0019_0FB20F69984C13D8"/>
lethargy, to a care (chap. 2.) an affectionate and an immediate care about it, (chap. 3.) I will labour to fix a deep and awful conviction of guilt upon his conſcience. (chap. 4.), and to ſtrip him of his vain excuſes and his flattering hopes, (chap. 5.) I will read to him, oh! that I could fix on his heart, that ſentence, that dreadful ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which a righteous and an Almighty God hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt him as a ſinner, (chap. 6.); and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to ſhow him in how helpleſs a ſtate he lies under this condemnation, as to any capacity he has of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, (chap. 7.) But I do not mean to leave any in ſo terrible a ſituation; I will joyfully proclaim <q>the glad tidings of pardon and ſalvation by Chriſt Jeſus our Lord,</q> which is all the ſupport and confidence of my own ſoul, (chap. 8.); and then I will give ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral view of the way by which this ſalvation is to be obtained, (chap. 9.); urging the ſinner to accept of it as affectionately as I can, (chap. 10.); though nothing can be ſufficiently pathetic, where, as in this matter, the life of an immortal ſoul is in queſtion.</p>
               <p n="8">§ 8. Too probable it is, that ſome will, after all this, remain inſenſible; and therefore, that their ſad caſe may not incumber the following articles, I ſhall here take a ſolemn leave of them, (chap. 11.); and then ſhall turn and addreſs myſelf, as compaſſionately as I can to a moſt contrary character; I mean to a ſoul overwhelmed with a ſenſe of the greatneſs of its ſins, and trembling under the burden, as if there were no more hope for him in God, (chap. 12.) and that nothing may be omitted which may give ſolid peace to the troubled ſpirit, I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to guide its enquiries as to the evidences of ſincere repentance and faith, (chap. 13.); which will be far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther illuſtrated by a more particular view of the ſeveral branches of the Chriſtian temper, ſuch as may ſerve at once to aſſiſt the reader in judging what he is, and to ſhow him what he ſhould labour to be, (chap. 14) This will naturally lead to a view of the need we have of the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the bleſſed Spirit to aſſiſt us in the important and difficult work of the true Chriſtian; and of the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we have to hope for theſe divine aſſiſtances, (chap.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:021060_0020_0FB20F6EA830E508"/>
15.) In an humble dependence on which I ſhall then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on the conſideration of ſeveral caſes, which often oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur in the Chriſtian life, in which, particular addreſſes to the conſcience may be requiſite and uſeful.</p>
               <p n="9">§ 9. As ſome peculiar difficulties and diſcouragements attend the firſt entrance on a religious courſe, it will here be our firſt care to animate the young convert a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, (chap. 16.) And that it may be done more effectually, I ſhall urge a ſolemn dedication of himſelf to God, (chap. 17.); to be confirmed by entering into the full communion of the church by an approach to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred table, (chap. 18.) That theſe engagements may be more happily fulfilled, we ſhall endeavour to draw a more particular plan of that devout, regular, and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate courſe, which ought daily to be attended to, (chap. 19.); and becauſe the idea will probably riſe ſo much higher than what is the general practice, even of good men, we ſhall endeavour to perſuade the reader to make the attempt, hard as it may ſeem, (chap. 20.); and ſhall caution him againſt various temptations, which might otherwiſe draw him aſide to negligence and ſin, (chap. 21.)</p>
               <p n="10">§ 10. Happy will it be for the reader, if theſe exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and cautions to be attended to with becoming re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard: but as it is, alas! too probable, that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all, the infirmities of nature will ſometimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, we ſhall conſider the caſe of deadneſs and langour in religion, which often ſteals upon us by inſenſible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, (chap. 22.); from whence there is too eaſy a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to that terrible one of a return unto known and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate ſin, (chap. 23.) And as the one or the other of theſe tends, in a proportionable degree, to provoke the bleſſed God to hide his face, and his injured Spirit to withdraw, that melancholy condition will be taken into a particular ſurvey, (chap. 24.) I ſhall then take notice alſo of the caſe of great and heavy afflictions in life, (chap. 25.) a diſcipline which the beſt of men have reaſon to expect, eſpecially when they backſlide from God, and yield to their ſpiritual enemies.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:021060_0021_0FB20F705A2BFB50"/>§ 11. Inſtances of this kind will, I fear, be too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent; yet, I truſt, there will be many others, whoſe path, like the dawning light," will <q>ſhine more and more unto the perfect day<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Prov. iv. 18.</note>.</q> And therefore we ſhall endeavour, in the beſt manner we can, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the Chriſtian in paſſing a true judgment on the growth of grace in his heart, (chap. 26.) as we had done before in judging of its ſincerity. And as nothing conduces more to the advancement of grace than the lively ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of love to God, a holy joy in him, we ſhall here remind the real Chriſtian of thoſe mercies which tend to excite that love and joy (chap. 27.) and, in the views of them, to animate him to thoſe vigorous efforts of uſefulneſs in life which ſo well becomes his character, and will have ſo happy an efficacy on brightening his crown, (chap. 28.) Suppoſing him to act accordingly, we ſhall then labour to illuſtrate and aſſiſt the delight with which he may look forward to the awful ſolemnities of death and judgment, (chap. 29.): and ſhall cloſe the ſcene by accompanying him, as it were, to the neareſt confines of that dark valley, through which he is to paſs to glory; giving him ſuch directions as may ſeem moſt ſubſervient to his honouring God, and adorning religion, by his dying behaviour, (chap. 30.) Nor am I without a pleaſing hope, that, through the divine bleſſing and grace, I may be, in ſome inſtances, ſo ſucceſsful as to leave thoſe triumphing in the views of judgment and eternity, and glorifying God by a truly Chriſtian life and death, whom I found trembling in the apprehenſions of future miſery; or, perhaps, in a much more dangerous and miſerable circumſtance than that; I mean, entirely forgetting the proſpect, and ſunk into the moſt ſtupid inſenſibility of thoſe things, for an attendance to which the human mind was formed, and in compariſon of which all the purſuits of this tranſitory life are emptier than wind, and lighter than a feather.</p>
               <p n="12">§ 12. Such a variety of heads muſt, to be ſure, be handled but briefly, as we intend to bring them within
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:021060_0022_0FB20F71D711B748"/>
the bulk of a moderate volume. I ſhall not, therefore, diſcuſs them, as a preacher might properly do in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, in which the truths of religion are profeſſedly to be explained and taught, defended and improved, in a wide variety, and long detail of propoſitions, arguments, objections, replies, and inferences, marſhalled, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered under their diſtinct generals. I ſhall here ſpeak in a looſer and freer manner, as a friend to a friend; juſt as I would do if I were to be in perſon admitted to a private audience by one whom I tenderly loved, and whoſe circumſtance and character I knew to be like that which the title of one chapter or another of this treatiſe deſcribes. And when I have diſcourſed with him a little while, which will ſeldom be ſo long as half an hour, I ſhall, as it were, ſtep aſide, and leave him to meditate on what be has heard, or endeavour to aſſiſt him in ſuch ſervent addreſſes to God as it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to mingle with thoſe meditations. In the mean time, I will here take the liberty to pray over my read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and my work, and to commend it ſolemnly to the divine bleſſing, in token of my deep conviction of an entire dependance upon it.. And I am well perſuaded, that ſentiments like theſe are common, in the general, to every faithful miniſter, to every real Chriſtian.</p>

All your thoughts, and all your hours, are divided between the buſineſs and amuſements of life: and if, now and then, an awful providence, or a ſerious ſermon or book, awakens you, it is but a few days, or it may be, a few hours, and you are the ſame careleſs creature you ever were before. On the whole, you act as if you were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to put it to the venture, and, at your own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, to make the experiment, whether the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of neglecting religion be indeed as terrible as its miniſters and friends have repreſented. Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances do, indeed, ſometimes force themſelves up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you, as (conſidering the age and country in which you live) it is hardly poſſible entirely to avoid them; but you have, it may be, found out the art of Iſaiah's people, <q>Hearing to hear, and not underſtand; and ſeeing to ſee, and not perceive; your heart is waxed groſs, your eyes are cloſed, and your ears heavy<note n="(g)" place="bottom">Iſa. vi. 9, 10.</note>.</q> Under the very ordinances of worſhip, your thoughts "are at the ends of the earth<note n="(h)" place="bottom">Prov. xvii. 24.</note>."

Nor is this his care limited to you; but, if you look all around you, far as your views can reach, you ſee it extending itſelf on every ſide; and, oh, how much farther than you can trace it! Reflect on the light and heat which the ſun every where diſperſes? on the air which ſurrounds all our globe, on the right temperature of which the life of the whole human race depends, and that of all the inferior creatures which dwell on the earth. Think of the ſuitable and plentiful proviſion made for man and beaſt: the graſs the grain, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of fruits, and herbs, and flowers; every thing that nouriſhes us, every thing that delight us; and ſay, whether it do not ſpeak plainly and loudly that our al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Maker is near, and that he is careful of us, and kind to us. And while all theſe things proclaim his goodneſs, do they not alſo proclaim his power? For what power has any thing comparable to that which furniſhes out theſe gifts of royal bounty; and which, unwearied and unchanged, produces continually, from day to day, and from age to age, ſuch aſtoniſhing and magnificent effects over the face of the whole earth, and through all the regions of heaven?</p>

It is then evident, that God is preſent, preſent with you at this moment; even God, your Creator and preſerver, God, the Creator and Preſerver of the whole viſible and inviſible world.

Has he given us a ſenſe and diſcernment of what is good and evil, of what is true and falſe, of what is fair and deformed in temper and conduct? and has he himſelf no diſcernment of theſe things?

By thoſe that are capable of attaining to ſome knowledge of him, and preſenting to him ſome homage? Is it decent and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that he ſhould he forgotten and neglected by you? Are you alone, of all the works of his hands, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten and neglected by him? Oh ſinner, thoughtleſs as you are, you cannot dare to ſay that, or even to think it. You need not go back to the helpleſs days of your infancy and childhood to convince you of the contrary; you need not, in order to this, to recollect the remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able deliverances which, perhaps, were wrought out for you many years ago: the repoſe of the laſt night, the refreſhment and comfort you have received this day; yea, the mercies you are receiving this very moment, bear witneſs to him; and yet you regard him not. Ungrateful creature that you are! could you have treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any human benefactor thus? Could you have borne to neglect a kind parent, or any generous friend that had but for a few months acted the part of a parent to you? to have taken no notice of him, while in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; to have returned him no thanks; to have had no contrivances to make ſome little acknowledgment for all his goodneſs? Human nature, bad as it is, is not fallen ſo low; nay, the brutal nature is not ſo low as this. Surely every domeſtic animal around you, muſt ſhame ſuch ingratitude. If you do but for a few days

Nay brutes, far leſs ſagacious and apprehenſive, have ſome ſenſe of our kindneſs, and expreſs it after their way; as the bleſſed God condeſcends to obſerve, in this very view in which I mention it, <q>the dull ox knows his owner, and the ſtupid aſs his maſter's crib<note n="(o)" place="bottom">Iſa. i. 3.</note>:</q> what lamentable degeneracy therefore is it that you do not know, that you, who have been numbered among God's profeſſed people, do not, and, will not, conſider your numberleſs obligations to him?</p>

Surely, if you have any ingenuity of temper, you muſt be aſhamed and grieved in the review; but if you have not, give me leave farther to expoſtulate with you on this head, by ſetting it in ſomething of a different light. Can you think yourſelves ſafe while you are acting a part like this? Do you not in your conſcience believe there will be a future judgment? Do you not believe there is an inviſible and eternal world? As profeſſed Chriſtians, we all believe it; for it is no controverted point, but diſplayed in Scripture with ſo clear an evidence, that, ſubtile and ingenious as men are in error, they have not yet found out a way to evade it. And believing this, do you not ſee, that while you are thus wandering from God, <q>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and miſery are in your ways<note n="(p)" place="bottom">Rom. iii. 16.</note>?</q> Will this indolence and negligence of temper, be any ſecurity to you? will it guard you from death? will it excuſe you from judgment? You might much more reaſonably expect, that ſhutting your eyes would be a defence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the rage of a devouring lion; or that looking another way ſhould ſecure your body from being pierced by a bullet or a ſword. When God ſpeaks of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant folly of ſome thoughtleſs creatures, who would

And is not this applicable to you? Muſt you not, ſooner or later, be brought to think of theſe things whether you will or no? And, in the mean time, do you not certainly know, that timely and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reflection upon them is, through divine grace, the only way to prevent your ruin?</p>
               <p n="15">§ 15. Yes, ſinner, I need not multiply words on a ſubject like this. Your conſcience is already inwardly convinced, though your pride may be unwilling to own it. And, to prove it, let me aſk you one queſtion more: Would you, upon any terms and conſiderations what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, come to a reſolution, abſolutely to diſmiſs all fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thought of religion, and all care about it, from this day and hour, and to abide by the conſequences of that neglect?

But if it be neceſſary to take theſe things into conſideration at all, it is neceſſary to do it quickly; for life itſelf is not ſo very long, nor ſo certain, that a wiſe man ſhould riſk much upon its continuance.

               <head>CHAP. III. The awakened Sinner urged to immediate Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, and cautioned againſt Delay.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Sinners when awakened, inclinable to diſmiſs convictions for the preſent, § <hi>1.</hi> An immediate regard to religion urged, § <hi>2. (1.)</hi> From the excellency and pleaſures of the thing itſelf, § <hi>3. (2.)</hi> From the uncertainty of that future time on which ſinners preſume, compared with the ſad conſequences of being cut off in ſin, § <hi>4.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">§ 1. I HOPE my laſt addreſs ſo far awakened the convictions of my reader, as to bring him to this purpoſe, <q>That ſome time or other he would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to religious conſiderations.</q> But give me leave to aſk earneſtly and punctually, "When that ſhall be?" —<q>Go thy way for this time, and at a more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ſeaſon I will ſend for thee,</q> was the language and the ruin of unhappy Felix<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Acts. xxiv, 25.</note>, when he trembled under the reaſonings and expoſtulations of the apoſtle. The tempter preſumed not to urge that he ſhould give
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:021060_0037_0FB20F98282BAD18"/>
up all thoughts of repentance and reformation; but only that, conſidering the preſent hurry of his affairs, (as no doubt they were many,) he ſhould defer it to a longer day. The artifice ſucceeded, and Felix was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. Will you, reader, diſmiſs me thus? For your own ſake, and out of tender compaſſion to your periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immortal ſoul, I would not willingly take up with ſuch a diſmiſſion and excuſe. No, not though you ſhould fix a time; though you ſhould determine on the next year, or month, or week, or day. I would turn upon you, with all the eagerneſs and tenderneſs of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly importunity, and intreat you to bring the matter to an iſſue even now; for if you ſay, <q>I will think on theſe things to-morrow,</q> I ſhall have little hope, and ſhall conclude, that all that I have hitherto urged, and all that you have read, hath been offered and view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vain.</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. When I invite you to the care and practice of religion, it may ſeem ſtrange that it ſhould be neceſſary for me affectionately to plead the caſe with you, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to your immediate regard and compliance. What I am inviting you to is ſo noble and excellent in itſelf, ſo well worthy the dignity of our rational nature, ſo ſuitable to it, ſo manly, and ſo wiſe, that one would imagine you ſhould take fire, as it were at the firſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; yea, that ſo delightful a view ſhould preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſs your whole ſoul with a kind of indignation againſt yourſelf that you purſued it no ſooner. <q>May I lift up mine eyes and my ſoul to God? may I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote myſelf to him? may I even now commence a friendſhip with him, a friendſhip which ſhall laſt for ever, the ſecurity, the delight, the glory of this immortal nature of mine? And ſhall I draw back, and ſay, Nevertheleſs, let me not commence this friendſhip too ſoon: let me live at leaſt a few weeks, or a few days longer, without God in the world?</q> Surely it would be much more reaſonable to turn inward, and ſay, <q>Oh, my ſoul, on what vile huſks haſt thou been feeding, while thine heavenly Father hath been
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:021060_0038_0FB20F9C73892D20"/>
forſaken and injured? Shall I deſire to multiply the days of my poverty, my ſcandal, and my miſery?</q> On this principle, ſurely, an immediate return to God ſhould, in all reaſon, be choſen, rather than to play the fool any longer, and go on a little more to diſpleaſe God, and thereby to ſtarve and to wound your own ſoul, even though your continuance in life were ever ſo certain, and your capacity to return to God and your duty ever ſo entirely in your own power now, and in every future moment, through ſcores of years yet to come.</p>
               <p n="4">§ 4. But who, or what are you, that you ſhould lay your account for years, or for months to come? "What is your life?" Is it not "even as a vapour that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth for a little time, and then vaniſheth away<note n="(b)" place="bottom">James iv, 14.</note>?" And what is your ſecurity, or what is your peculiar warrant, that you ſhould thus depend upon the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of its continuance? and that ſo abſolutely a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to venture, as it were, to pawn your ſoul upon it? Why, you will perhaps ſay, <q>I am young, and in all my bloom and vigour: I ſee hundreds about me, who are more than double my age, and not a few of them who ſeem to think it too ſoon to attend to religion yet.</q> You view the living, and you talk thus: but I beſeech you think of the dead. Return in your thoughts to thoſe graves, in which you have left ſome of your young com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions and your friends. You ſaw them a while ago gay and active; warm with life, and hopes, and ſchemes; and ſome of them would have thought a friend ſtrangely importunate that ſhould have interrupted them in their buſineſs, and their pleaſures, with a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn lecture of death and eternity: yet they were then on the very borders of both. You have ſince ſeen their corpſes, or at leaſt their coffins; and probably carried about with you the badges of mourning which you received at their funerals. Thoſe once vigorous, and, perhaps, beautiful bodies of theirs, now lying moulder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the duſt, as ſenſeleſs and helpleſs as the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cripid
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:021060_0039_0FB20F9F723AA098"/>
pieces of human nature which fourſcore years ever brought down to it. And, what is infinitely more to be regarded, their ſouls, whether prepared for this great change, or thoughtleſs of it, have made their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance before God, and are, at this moment, fixed either in heaven or in hell. Now, let me ſeriouſly aſk you, Would it be miraculous, or would it be ſtrange, if ſuch an event ſhould befal you? How are you ſure that ſome fatal diſeaſe ſhall not this day begin to work in your veins? How are you ſure that you ſhall ever be capable of reading or thinking any more, if you do not attend to what you now read, and purſue the thought which is now offering itſelf to your mind? This ſudden alteration may, at leaſt, poſſibly happen; and if it does, it will be to you a terrible one indeed. To be thus ſurpriſed into the preſence of a forgotten God; to be torn away, at once, from a world, to which your whole heart and ſoul has been rivetted; a world, which has engroſſed all your thoughts and cares, all your deſires and purſuits; and be fixed in a ſtate, which you could never be ſo far perſuaded to think of, as to ſpend ſo much as one hour in ſerious preparation for it: how muſt you even ſhudder at the apprehenſion of it, and with what horror muſt it fill you? It ſeems matter of wonder, that, in ſuch circumſtances, you are not almoſt diſtracted with the thoughts of the uncertainty of life, and are not even ready to die for fear of death. To trifle with God any longer, after ſo ſolemn an admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition as this, would be a circumſtance of additional provocation, which, after all the reſt, might be fatal: nor is there any thing that you can expect in ſuch a caſe, but that he ſhould cut you off immediately, and teach other thoughtleſs creatures, by your ruin, what a hazardous experiment they make when they act as you are acting.</p>
               <p n="5">§. 5. And will you, after all, run this deſperate riſk? For what imaginable purpoſe can you do it? Do you think the buſineſs of religion will become leſs neceſſary, or more eaſy, by your delay? You know that it will not. You know, that whatever the bleſſed God demands
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:021060_0040_0FB20FA059B91540"/>
now, he will alſo demand twenty or thirty years hence, if you ſhould live to ſee the time. God hath fixed the method, in which he will pardon and accept ſinners, in his goſpel. And, will he ever alter that method? or, if he will not, Can men alter it? You like not to think of repenting, and humbling yourſelf before God, to receive righteouſneſs and life from his free grace in Chriſt; and you above all diſlike the thought of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to God in the ways of holy obedience. But will he ever diſpenſe with any of theſe, and publiſh a new goſpel, with promiſes of life and ſalvation to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent unbelieving ſinners, if they will but call themſelves Chriſtians, and ſubmit to a few external rites? How long do you think you might wait for ſuch a change in the conſtitution of things? You know death will come upon you; and you cannot but know in your own conſcience, that a general diſſolution will come upon the world long before God can thus deny himſelf, and contradict all his perfections, and all his declarations.</p>
               <p n="6">§ 6. Or, if his demand continue the ſame, as they aſſuredly will, do you think any thing, which is now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to you in them, will be leſs diſagreeable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after than it is at preſent? Shall you live finleſs, when it is become more habitual to you, and when conſcience is yet more enfeebled and debauched? If you are <q>run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with the footmen and fainting, ſhall you be able to contend with the horſemen<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Jerem. xii, 5.</note>?</q> Surely you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not imagine it. You would not ſay in any diſtemper which threatened your life, <q>I will ſtay till I grow a little worſe, and then I will apply to a Phyſician: I will let my diſeaſe get a little more rooting in my vitals, and then I will try what can be done to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it.</q> No; it is only where the life of the ſoul is concerned that men think thus wildly: the life and health of the body appear too precious to be thus trifled away.</p>
               <p n="7">§ 7. If, after ſuch deſperate experiments, you are
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:021060_0041_0FB20FA1DC409EC8"/>
ever recovered, it muſt be by an operation of divine grace on your ſoul, yet more powerful and more won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful, in proportion to the increaſing inveteracy of your ſpiritual maladies. And can you expect that the Holy Spirit ſhould be more ready to aſſiſt you, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of your having ſo ſhamefully trifled with him, and affronted him! he is now, in ſome meaſure, mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on your heart: if you feel any ſecret relentings in it upon what you read, it is a ſign you are not yet ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly forſaken: but who can tell whether theſe are not the laſt touches he will ever give to a heart ſo long hardened againſt him? Who can tell but God may this day <q>ſwear in his wrath, that you ſhall not enter into his reſt<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Heb. iii, 18.</note>?</q> I have been telling you that you may immediately die. You own it poſſibly you may. And can you think of any thing more terrible? Yes, ſinner, I will tell you of one thing more dreadful than imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate death and immediate damnation. The bleſſed God may ſay, <q>As for that wretched creature, who has ſo long trifled with me, and provoked me, let him ſtill live: let him live in the midſt of proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity and plenty: let him live under the pureſt and moſt powerful ordinances of the goſpel too; that he may abuſe them, to aggravate his condemnation, and die under ſeven-fold guilt, and a ſeven-fold curſe. I will not give him the grace to think of his ways for one ſerious moment more; but he ſhall go on from bad to worſe, filling up the meaſure of his iniquities, till death and deſtruction ſeize him in an unexpected hour, and wrath come upon him to the uttermoſt<note n="(e)" place="bottom">1 Theſſ. ii, 16.</note>.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="8">§ 8. You think this is an uncommon caſe; but I fear it is much otherwiſe. I fear there are few congregations where the word of God has been faithfully preached, and where it has been long deſpiſed, eſpecially by thoſe whom it had once awakened, in which the eye of God does not ſee a number of ſuch wretched ſouls; though it is impoſſible for us to pronounce upon the caſe who they are.</p>
               <p n="9">
                  <pb n="29" facs="unknown:021060_0042_0FB20FA6695B7A88"/>§ 9. I pretend not to ſay how he will deal with you, oh reader; whether he will immediately cut you off or ſeal you up under final hardneſs and impenitency of heart; or whether his grace may, at length, awaken you, to conſider your ways, and to return to him, even when your heart is grown yet more obdurate than it is at preſent: for to his almighty grace nothing is hard, nor even to transform a rock of marble into a man and a ſaint. But this I will confidently ſay, That if you delay any longer, the time will come when you will bitterly repent of that delay; and either lament it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God in the anguiſh of your heart here, or curſe your own folly and madneſs in hell; yea, when you will wiſh that, dreadful as hell is, you had rather fallen into it ſooner than have lived in the midſt of ſo many abuſed mercies, to render the degrees of your puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more inſupportable, and your ſenſe of it more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely tormenting.</p>
               <p n="10">§. 10. I do therefore earneſtly exhort you, in the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by the worth, and, if I may ſo ſpeak, by the blood of your immortal and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing ſoul, that you delay not a day or an hour longer.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">§ 1. AS I am attempting to lead you to true religion, and not merely to ſome ſuperficial form of it, I am ſenſible I can do it no otherwiſe than in the way of deep humiliation. And therefore, ſuppoſing you are perſuaded, through the divine bleſſing on which you have before read, to take it into conſideration, I would now endeavour, in the firſt place, with all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs I can, to make you heartily ſenſible of your guilt before God. For I well know, that unleſs you are convinced of this, and affected with the conviction, all the proviſions of goſpel grace will be ſlighted, and your ſoul infallibly deſtroyed in the midſt of the nobleſt means appointed for its recovery. I am fully perſuaded that thouſands live and die in a courſe of ſin, without feeling upon their hearts any ſenſe that they are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; though they cannot, for ſhame, but own it in words. And therefore let me deal faithfully with you, though I may ſeem to deal roughly; for complaiſance is not to give law to addreſſes in which the life of your ſoul is concerned.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. Permit me, therefore, O ſinner, to conſider my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at this time as an advocate for God; as one employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his name to plead againſt thee, and to charge thee with nothing leſs than being a rebel and a traitor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſovereign Majeſty of heaven and earth. However thou mayeſt he dignified or diſtinguiſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong

men; if the nobleſt blood run in thy veins; if thy ſeat were among princes, and thine arm were "the terror of the Mighty in the land of the living<note n="(a)" place="bottom">Ezek. xxxii, 27.</note>;" it would <q>be neceſſary thou ſhouldſt be told, and told plainly, thou haſt broken the "laws of the King of kings,</q> and by the breach of it art become ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to his righteous condemnation.</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. Your conſcience tells you, that you were born the natural ſubject of God: born under the indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible obligations of his law. For it is moſt apparent, that the conſtitution of your rational nature, which makes you capable of receiving law from God, binds you to obey it. And it is equally evident and certain, that you have not exactly obeyed this law; nay, that you have violated it in many aggravated inſtances.</p>
               <p n="4">§ 4. Will you dare to deny this! Will you dare to aſſert your innocence! Remember, it muſt be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete innocence; yes, and a perfect righteouſneſs too; or it can ſtand you in no ſtead, farther than to prove that, though a condemned ſinner, you are not quite ſo criminal as ſome others, and will not have quite ſo hot a place in hell as they. And when this is conſidered, will you plead not guilty to the charge? Search the records of your own conſcience, for God ſearcheth them: aſk it ſeriouſly, "Have you never in your lives ſinned againſt God?" Solomon declared, that, in his day, there was not a juſt man upon earth, who did good, and ſinned not<note n="(b)" place="bottom">Eccl. vii, 20.</note>:" and the apoſtle Paul, that "all had ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God<note n="(c)" place="bottom">Rom. iii, 23.</note>:" that "both Jews and Gentiles," which, you know, comprehended the whole human race,) "were all under ſin<note n="(d)" place="bottom">Rom. iii, 9.</note>." And can you pretend any imaginable reaſon to believe the world is grown ſo much better ſince their days, that any ſhould now plead their own caſe as an exception? Or will you, however, preſume to ariſe in the face of the omniſcient Majeſty of heaven, and ſay, "I am the man."</p>

Has he not every day ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied your wants with an unwearied liberality; and added, with reſpect to many who will read this, the delicacies of life to its neceſſary ſupports? Has he not "heard you cry when trouble came upon you<note n="(t)" place="bottom">Job. xxvii, 9.</note>;" and frequently appeared for your deliverance, when in the diſtreſſes of nature you had called upon him for help?

Or, if it had not been ſo, is not this long continued and uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted health, which you have enjoyed for ſo many years, to be acknowledged as an equivalent obligation? Look around upon all your poſſeſſions, and ſay what one thing have you in the world which his goodneſs did not give you, and which he hath not thus far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to you? Add to all this, the kind notices of his will which he hath ſent you; the tender expoſtulations which he hath uſed with you to bring you to a wiſer and a better temper; and the diſcoveries and gracious invitations of his goſpel, which you have heard, and which you have deſpiſed: and then ſay whether your rebellion has not been aggravated by the vileſt ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and whether that aggravation can be accounted ſmall?</p>
               <p n="9">§ 9. Again, if it be any aggravation of ſin to be committed againſt conſcience, thy crimes, O ſinner,

have been ſo aggravated. Conſult the records of it, and then diſpute the fact if thou can. <q>There is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in man, and the inſpiration of the Almighty giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him underſtanding<note n="(w)" place="bottom">Iſ. xxxviii, 1.</note>;</q> and then underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will act, and a ſecret conviction of being account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to its Maker and Preſerver is inſeparable from the actings of it. It is eaſy, to object to human remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, and to give things falſe colourings before men; but the heart often condemns, while the tongue excuſes. Have you not often found it ſo? has not conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated againſt your paſt conduct; and have not theſe remonſtrances been very painful too? I have been aſſured by a gentleman of undoubted credit, that when he was in the purſuit of all the gayeſt ſenſualities of life, and was reckoned one of the happieſt of mankind, when he has ſeen a dog come into the room where he was among his merry companions, he has groaned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly, and ſaid, "Oh that I had been that dog!" And haſt thou, O ſinner, felt nothing like this? has thy conſcience been ſo ſtupified, ſo <q>ſeared with a hot iron<note n="(x)" place="bottom">1 Tim. iv, 2.</note>,</q> that it has never cried out of any of the violences which have been done in it? has it never warned thee of the fatal conſequences of what thou haſt done in oppoſition to it? Theſe warnings are, in effect, the voice of God; they are the admonitions which he gave thee by his vicegerent in thy breaſt. And when his ſentence for thy evil works is executed upon thee in everlaſting death, thou ſhalt hear that voice ſpeaking to thee again in a louder tone and a ſeverer accent than before: and thou ſhalt be tormented with its upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings thro' eternity, becauſe thou wouldeſt not in time hearken to its admonitions.</p>
               <p n="10">§ 10. Let me add farther: If it be any aggravation that ſin has been committed after God has been moving by his Spirit on the mind, ſurely your ſin has been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with that aggravation too. Under the Moſaic diſpenſation, dark and imperfect as it was, the Spirit ſtrove with the Jews; elſe Stephen could not have

                  </gap>, ſurely we may much more reaſonably apprehend that he ſtrives with ſinners under the goſpel. And have you never experienced any thing of this kind, even when there has been no external circumſtance to awaken you, nor any pious teacher near you; have you never perceived ſome ſecret impulſe upon your mind, leading you to think of religion, urging you to an immediate conſideration of it, ſweetly inviting you to make trial of it, and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you that you would lament this ſtupid neglect? O ſinner why were not theſe happy motions attended to? why did you not, as it were, ſpread out all the ſails of your ſoul to catch that heavenly, that favourable breeze? But you have careleſsly neglected it: you have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne theſe kind influences: how reaſonably then might the ſentence have gone forth in righteous diſpleaſure, "My Spirit "ſhall no more ſtrive<note n="(z)" place="bottom">Gen. vi, 3.</note>?" And, indeed, who can ſay that it is not already gone forth? If you feel no ſecret agitation of mind, no remorſe, no awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening, while you read ſuch a remonſtrance as this, there will be room, great room, to ſuſpect it.</p>
               <p n="11">§ 11. There is indeed one aggravation more, which may not attend your guilt, I mean that of being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt ſolemn covenant engagements: a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which has lain heavy on the conſciences of many, who perhaps, in the mean ſeries of their lives have ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God with great integrity. But let me call you to think to what is this owing? Is it not, that you have never perſonally made any ſolemn profeſſion of devoting yourſelf to God at all? have never done any thing which has appeared to your own apprehenſion an action by which you made a covenant with him; though you have heard ſo much of his covenant, though you have been ſo ſolemnly and ſo tenderly invited to it?

He heard and helped you, or you had not been reading theſe lines; and, by ſuch deliverance did, as it were, bind down your vows upon you: and therefore your guilt in the violation of them remains before him, though you are ſtupid enough to forget them. Nothing is forgotten, nothing is overlooked by him; and the day will come when the record ſhall be laid before you too.</p>
               <p n="12">§ 12. And now, O ſinner, think ſeriouſly with thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf what defence thou wilt make to all this!

               <p n="1">§ 1. MY laſt diſcourſe left the ſinner in a very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming and a very pitiable circumſtance; a criminal convicted at the bar of God, diſarmed of all pretences to perfect innocence and ſinleſs obedience, and, conſequently obnoxious to the ſentence of a holy law, which can make no allowance for any tranſgreſſion, no, not for the leaſt; but pronounces death and a curſe againſt every act of diſobedience: how much more then againſt thoſe numberleſs and aggravated acts of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, of which, O ſinner, thy conſcience hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

I would hope ſome of my readers will ingeniouſly fall under the conviction, and not think of making any apology: for, ſure I am, that humbly to plead guilty at the divine bar, is the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and, all things conſidered, the moſt prudent thing that can be done in ſuch an unhappy circumſtance. Yet I know the treachery and the ſelf-flattery of a ſinful and a corrupted heart. I know what excuſes it makes; and how, when it is driven from one refuge it flies to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to fortify itſelf againſt full conviction, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade, not merely another, but itſelf, <q>That, if it has been in ſome inſtances to blame, it is not quite ſo criminal as was repreſented; that there are at leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations that plead in its favour, which, if they cannot juſtify, will, in ſome degree excuſe.</q> A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret reſerve of this kind, ſometimes perhaps ſcarce formed into a diſtinct reflection, breaks the force of conviction, and often prevents that deep humiliation before God, which is the happieſt token of an approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deliverance.

If you argued about it on the principles of common ſenſe, you muſt have judged and proved it to be a practical thing: and, if it was ſo, why did not you practiſe accordingly?

You have not been a drunkard, an adulterer, or a robber. So far it is well. You ſtand before a righteous God, who will do you ample juſtice; and therefore will not condemn you for drunkenneſs, adultery, or robbery. But you have forgotten him, your Parent and your Benefactor; you have <q>caſt off fear, and reſtrained prayer before him,<note n="(r)" place="bottom">Job. xv, 4.</note>;</q> you have deſpiſed the blood of his Son, and all the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal bleſſings which he purchaſed with it.

in your temper and conduct, the exerciſe of it has, in a great meaſure, been its own reward, if there were any thing more than form and artifice in it; and the various bounties of divine Providence to you amidſt all your numberleſs provocations, have been a thouſand times more than an equivalent for ſuch defective and imperfect virtues as theſe. You remain, therefore chargeable with the guilt of a thouſand offences, for which you have no excuſe at all; though there are ſome other inſtances in which you did not groſsly offend.

What end could you propoſe by any thing elſe of equal moment? Nay, with all your engagements, conſcience will tell you that there have been ſeaſons when, for want of thought, time and life have been a burden to you: yet you guarded againſt thought as againſt an enemy, and caſt up (as it were) an intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

But ſome may, perhaps, imagine, that one im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant apology is yet unheard, and that there may be room to ſay, <q>You were, by the neceſſity of your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, impelled to thoſe things which are now charged upon you as crimes; whereas it was not in your pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to have avoided them in the circumſtances in which you were placed.</q> If this will do any thing, it indeed promiſes to do much; ſo much, that it will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to nothing. If I were diſpoſed to anſwer you upon the folly and madneſs of your own principles, I might ſay, that the ſame conſideration which proves it was neceſſary for you to offend, proves alſo that it is neceſſary for God to puniſh you: and that, indeed, he cannot but do it: and I might further ſay, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent writer of our own age<note n="*" place="bottom">Biſhop of Briſtol's Analogy, &amp;c. p. 135. 8vo edit.</note>, <q>That the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples which deſtroy the injuſtice of ſins, deſtroy the injuſtice of puniſhments too.</q> But, if you cannot admit this, if you ſhould ſtill reply in ſpite of principle, That it muſt be unjuſt to puniſh you for an action ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly and abſolutely unavoidable; I really think you would anſwer right. But, in that anſwer you will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict your own ſcheme, (as I obſerved above): and I leave your conſcience to judge what ſort of a ſcheme that muſt be which would make all kind of puniſhment unjuſt; for the argument will, on the whole, be the
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:021060_0064_0FB20FDD7507DDE0"/>
ſame, whether with regard to human puniſhment or divine. It is a ſcheme full of confuſion and horror. You would not, I am ſure, take it from a ſervant who had robbed you, and then fired your houſe; you would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver inwardly believe, that he could not have helped it, or think that he had fairly excuſed himſelf by ſuch a plea. And, I am perſuaded, you would be ſo far from preſuming to offer it to God at the great day, that you would not venture to turn it into a prayer even now. Imagine you ſaw a malefactor dying with ſuch words as theſe: O God, it is true, I did indeed rob and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <q>my fellow-creature; but thou knoweſt that, as my circumſtances were ordered, I could not do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: my will was irreſiſtibly determined by the motives which thou didſt ſet before me; and I could as well have ſhaken the foundations of the earth, or darkened the ſun in the firmament, as have reſiſted the impulſe which bore me on.</q> I put it to your conſcience whether you would not look on ſuch a ſpeech as this with deteſtation, as one enormity added to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Yet, if the excuſe would have any weight in your mouth, it would have equal weight in his, or would be equally applicable to any the moſt ſhocking occaſion. But, indeed, it is ſo contrary to the plaineſt principles of common reaſon, that I can hardly perſuade myſelf any one could ſeriouſly and thoroughly believe it; and ſhould imagine my time very ill employed here if I were to ſet myſelf to combat thoſe pretences to argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by which the wantonneſs of human wit has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to varniſh it over.</p>
               <p n="11">§ 11. You ſee, then, on the whole, the vanity of all your pleas, and how eaſily the moſt plauſible of them might be ſilenced by a mortal man like yourſelf; how much more, then, by Him who ſearches all hearts, and can, in a moment, flaſh in upon the conſcience a moſt powerful and irreſiſtible conviction?

In the mean time, thou muſt "make thy bed in hell<note n="[f]" place="bottom">Pſ. cxxxix, 8.</note>:" and, O unhappy man? wilt thou lie down there with a ſecret hope that the moment will come when the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of divine juſtice will not be able to inflict any thing more than thou haſt endured, and when thou mayeſt claim thy diſcharge as a matter of right? It would indeed be well for thee if thou couldeſt carry down with thee ſuch a hope, falſe and flattering as it is: but, alas! thou wilt ſee things in ſo juſt a light, that to have no comfort but this will be eternal deſpair. That one word of thy ſentence, <hi>Everlaſting fire;</hi> that one declaration, "The worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched;" will be ſufficient to ſtrike ſuch a thought into black con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and to overwhelm thee with hopeleſs agony and horror.</p>

In vain wouldſt thou attempt it even for one day.

Can the world ſave thee? that vain deluſive idol of thy wiſhes and purſuits, to which thou art ſacrificing thine eternal hopes? Well doſt thou know that it will utterly forſake thee when thou needeſt it moſt; and that not one of its enjoyments can be carried along with thee into the inviſible ſtate; no, not ſo much as a trifle to remember it by, if thou couldſt deſire to remember ſo inconſtant and ſo treacherous a friend as the world has been.</p>

of this, that when you lye on the border of the grave, you will be unwilling to ſee or to converſe with thoſe that were once your favourite companions. They will afflict you rather than relieve you, even then how much leſs can they relieve you before the bar of God, when they are overwhelmed with their own condemnation?</p>
               <p n="8">§ 8. As for the powers of darkneſs, you are ſure they will be far from any ability or inclination to help you. Satan has been watching and labouring for your deſtruction, and he will triumph in it. But if there could be any thing of an amicable confederacy between you, what would that be but an aſſociation in ruin? For the day of judgment of ungodly men will alſo be the judgment of theſe rebellious ſpirits; and the fire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which thou, O ſinner, muſt depart, is that which was "prepared for the devil and his angels<note n="(h)" place="bottom">Matth. xxv, 41.</note>."</p>
               <p n="9">§ 9. Will the celeſtial ſpirits then ſave thee? will they interpoſe their power or their prayers in thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour? An interpoſition of power, when ſentence is gone forth againſt thee, were an act of rebellion againſt Heaven, which theſe holy and excellent creatures would abhor. And when the final pleaſure of the Judge is known, inſtead of interceding, in vain, for the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed criminal, they would rather, with ardent zeal for the glory of their Lord, and cordial acquieſcence in the determination of his wiſdom and juſtice, prepare to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute it. Yea, difficult as it may at preſent be to conceive it, it is a certain truth, that the ſervants of Chriſt who now moſt tenderly love you, and moſt affectionately ſeek your ſalvation, not excepting thoſe who are allied to you in the neareſt bonds of nature, or of friendſhip, even they ſhall put their <hi>Amen</hi> to it. Now, indeed their bowels yearn over you, and their eye poureth out tears on your account; now they expoſtulate with you, and plead with God for you, if by any means, while yet there is hope, you may be <q>plucked as a firebrand out of the burning<note n="(i)" place="bottom">Amos iv, 11.</note>;</q> but, alas! their remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances you will not regard; and as for their prayers, what ſhould they aſk for you? what but this, that you

               <argument>
                  <p>The awful things which have hitherto been ſaid, intended not to grieve, but to help, § <hi>1.</hi> After ſome reflection on the pleaſure with which a miniſter of the goſpel may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver the meſſage with which he is charged, § <hi>2.</hi> and ſome reaſons for the repetition of what is in ſpeculation ſo generally known, § <hi>3.</hi> the author proceeds briefly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the ſubſtance of theſe glad tidings: <hi>viz.</hi> That God having, in his infinite compaſſion, ſent his Son to die for ſinners, is now reconcileable through him, § <hi>4.—6.;</hi> So that the moſt heinous tranſgreſſions ſhall be entirely pardoned to believers, and they made completely and eternally happy, § <hi>7, 8</hi> The ſinner's reflection on this good news.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>§ 1. MY dear reader! it is the great deſign of the goſpel, and, wherever it is cordially received, it is the glorious effect of it, to fill the heart with ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of love; to teach us to abhor all unneceſſary ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and ſeverity, and to delight, not in the grief, but in the happineſs of our fellow-creatures. I can hardly apprehend how he can be a Chriſtian who takes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the diſtreſs which appears even in a brute, much leſs in that of a human mind; and, eſpecially, in ſuch diſtreſs as the thoughts I have been propoſing muſt give, if there be any due attention to their weight and ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. I have often felt a tender regret while I have been repreſenting theſe things; and I could have wiſhed from mine heart that it had not been neceſſary to have placed them in ſo ſevere and ſo painful a light. But now I am addreſſing myſelf to a part of my work, which I undertake with untterable pleaſure; and to that which indeed I had in view, in all thoſe awful things which I have already been laying before you. I have been ſhowing you, that, if you hitherto have lived in a ſtate of impenitence and ſin, you are condemned by God's righteous judgment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and have in yourſelf no ſpring of hope and no poſſibility of deliverance. But I
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:021060_0084_0FB210125DD8F9D8"/>
mean not to leave you under this ſad apprehenſion, to lye down and die in deſpair, complaining of that cruel zeal which has "tormented you before the time." Matth. viii, 29.</p>
               <p>§ 2. Ariſe, O thou dejected ſoul, that art proſtrate in the duſt before God, and trembling under the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of his righteous ſentence: for I am commiſſioned to tell thee, that though <q>thou haſt deſtroyed thyſelf, in God is thine help, Hoſea 13, 9." I bring thee good tidings of great joy, Luke 2, 10,</q> which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light my own heart while I proclaim them, and will, I hope, reach and revive thine; even the tidings of ſalvation by the blood and righteouſneſs of the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And I give it thee, for thy greater ſecurity, in the words of a gracious and forgiving God, that <q>he is in Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, and not imputing to them their treſpaſſes, 2 Cor. 5, 19.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§ 3. This is the beſt news that ever was heard, the moſt important meſſage which God ever ſent to his creatures; and though I doubt not at all, but living, as you have done, in a Chriſtian country, you have heard it often, perhaps a thouſand and a thouſand times, I will, with all ſimplicity and plainneſs, repeat it to you again, and repeat it as if you had never heard it before. If thou, O ſinner, ſhouldſt now, for the firſt time, feel it, then will it be as a new goſpel unto thee, though ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to thine ear; nor ſhall it be grievous for me to ſpeak what is ſo common, ſince to you it is ſafe and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, Phil. 3, 1. They who are moſt deeply and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timately acquainted with it, inſtead of being cloyed and ſatiated, will hear it with diſtinguiſhed pleaſure; and as for thoſe who have hitherto ſlighted it, I am ſure they had need to hear it again. Nor is it abſolutely impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that ſome one ſoul, at leaſt, may read theſe lines who hath never been clearly and fully inſtructed in this important doctrine, though his everlaſting All de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on knowing and receiving it. I will therefore take care that ſuch a one ſhall not have it to plead at the bar of God, that tho' he lived in a Chriſtian coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, he was never plainly and faithfully taught the doctrine of ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, <q>the way, the
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:021060_0085_0FB21014A11F33C8"/>
truth, and the life, by whom alone we come unto the Father, John 14, 6.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">§ 4. I do therefore teſtify unto you this day, that the holy and gracious Majeſty of heaven and earth, foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fatal apoſtacy into which the whole human race would fall, did not determine to deal in a way of ſtrict and rigorous ſeverity with us, ſo as to conſign us over to univerſal ruin and inevitable damnation; but, on the contrary, he determined to enter into a treaty of peace and reconciliation, and to publiſh to all, whom the goſpel ſhould reach, the expreſs offers of life and glory, in a certain method, which his infinite wiſdom judged ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the purity of his nature, and the honour of his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. This method was indeed a moſt aſtoniſhing one, which, familiar, as it is to our thoughts and our tongues, I cannot recollect and mention without great amazement. He determined to ſend his own Son into the world, "the brightneſs of his glory, and the expreſs image of his perſon, Heb. 1, 3. partaker of his own di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine perfections and honours, to be not merely a teacher of righteouſneſs, and a meſſenger of grace, but alſo a ſacrifice for the ſins of men; and would conſent to his ſaving them on no other condition but this, that he ſhould not only labour, but die in the cauſe.</p>
               <p n="5">§ 5. Accordingly, at ſuch a period of time as infinite Wiſdom ſaw moſt convenient, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in human fleſh; and after he had gone through inceſſant and long continued fatigues, and borne all the preceding injuries which the ingratitude and malice of men could inflict, he voluntarily <q>ſubmitted himſelf to death, even the death of the croſs; Phil. 2, 8.</q> and having been <q>delivered for our offences, was raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again for our juſtification, Rom. 4, 25.</q> After his reſurrection he continued long enough on earth to give his followers moſt convincing evidences of it, and then "aſcended into heaven in their ſight, Acts 1, 9— 11;" and ſent down his Spirit from thence upon his apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, to enable them, in the moſt perſuaſive and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative manner, to "preach the goſpel, Luke 24, 40:" and he has given it in charge to them, and to thoſe who,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:021060_0086_0FB2101616FB0A98"/>
in every age, ſucceed them in this part of their office, that it ſhould be publiſhed "to every creature, Mark. 16, 15;" that all who believe in it may be ſaved, by virtue of its abiding energy, and the immutable power and grace of its divine author, who is, <q>the ſame yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday, to-day and for ever, Heb. 13, 8.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">§ 6. This goſpel do I therefore now preach, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim unto thee, O reader, with the ſincereſt deſire that, through divine grace, it may this very day be <q>ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thy ſoul, Luke 19, 9.</q> Know therefore, and conſider it, whoſoever thou art, that as ſurely as theſe words are now before thine eyes, ſo ſure it is that the incarnate Son of God "was made a ſpectacle to the world, and to "angels, and to men, 1 Cor. 4, 9;" his back torn with ſcourges, his head with thorns, his limbs ſtretched out as on a rack, and nailed to the accurſed tree; and in this miſerable condition he was hung up by his hands and his feet, as an object of public infamy and contempt. Thus did he die, in the midſt of all the taunts and inſults of his cruel enemies who thirſted for his blood; and which was the ſaddeſt circumſtance of all, in the midſt of theſe agonies with which he cloſed the moſt innocent, perfect, and uſeful life that ever was ſpent upon earth, he had not thoſe ſupports of the divine preſence which ſinful men have often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, when they have been ſuffering for the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of their conſcience. They have often burſt out into tranſports of joy and ſongs of praiſe while their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutioners have been glutting their helliſh malice, and more than ſavage barbarity, by making their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments artificially grievous; but the crucified Jeſus cried out, in the diſtreſs of his ſpotleſs and holy ſoul, <q>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? Matth. 27, 46.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="7">§ 7. Look upon our dear Redeemer! Look up to this mournful, dreadful, yet, in one view, delightful ſpectacle, and then aſk thine own heart, Do ye believe that Jeſus ſuffered and died thus? and why did he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer and die? Let me anſwer in God's own words, <q>He was wounded for our tranſgreſſions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities, and the chaſtiſement of our peace was
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:021060_0087_0FB21017B7630420"/>
upon him, that by his ſtripes we might be healed: it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, and to put him to grief, when he made his ſoul an offering for ſin?</q> for, the Lord "laid on him the iniquity of us all, Iſa. 53, 5.6.10. So that I may addreſs you in the words of the Apoſtle, <q>Be it known unto you therefore, that through this man is preached unto you the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſin, Acts 13, 38.</q> as it was his command, juſt after he aroſe from the dead, that <q>repentance and remiſſion of his ſins ſhould be preached in his name unto all nations, beginning at Jeruſalem, Luke 24, 47;</q> the very place where his blood had ſo lately been ſhed in ſo cruel a manner. I do therefore teſtify unto you, in the words of another inſpired writer, that "Chriſt was made ſin," that is, a ſin-offering, "for us though he knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him, 2 Cor. 5, 21;" that is, that through the righteouſneſs he has fulfilled, and the atonement he has made, we might be accepted by God as righteous, and be not only pardoned, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived into his favour. <q>To you is the word of this ſalvation ſent, Acts 13, 26;</q> and to you, O reader, are the bleſſings of it even now offered by God; ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely offered; ſo that, after all I have ſaid under the former heads, it is not your having broken the law of God that ſhall prove your ruin, if you do not alſo reject his goſpel. It is not all thoſe legions of ſins which riſe up in battle array againſt you that ſhall be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy you, if unbelief do not lead them on, and final impenitence do not bring up the rear. I know that guilt is a timorous thing: I will therefore ſpeak in the words of God himſelf; nor can any be more comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: <q>He that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting life, John 3, 36; and he ſhall never come into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, John 5, 24: there is therefore now no condemnation,</q> no kind or degree of it, to them, to any one of them, <q>who are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the Spirit, Rom. 8, 1.</q> You have indeed been a very great ſinner, and your offences have truly been attended with moſt heinous aggravations; nevertheleſs, you may rejoice in
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:021060_0088_0FB2101F0B395250"/>
the aſſurance, that <q>where ſin hath abounded, there ſhall grace much more abound, Rom. 5, 20; that where ſin hath reigned unto death,</q> where it has had its moſt unlimited ſway, and moſt unreſiſted tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, there ſhall <q>righteouſneſs reign to eternal life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, Rom. 5, 21.</q> That righteouſneſs, to which, on believing on him, thou wilt be entitled, ſhall not only break thoſe chains by which ſin is (as it were) dragging thee at its chariot wheels with a furious pace to eternal ruin, but it ſhall clothe thee with the robes of ſalvation, ſhall ſix thee on a throne of glory, where thou ſhalt live and reign for ever among the princes of heaven; ſhalt reign in immortal beauty and joy, without one remaining ſcar of divine diſpleaſure upon thee, without any ſingle mark by which it could be known that thou hadſt ever been obnoxious to wrath and a curſe; except it be an anthem of praiſe, to "the Lamb that was ſlain, and "has waſhed thee from thy ſins in his own blood, Rev. 1, 5.</p>

                  <p>OH, my ſoul, how aſtoniſhing is the meſſage which thou haſt this day received! I have indeed often heard it before, and it is grown ſo common to me that the ſurpriſe is not ſenſible: but reflect, O my ſoul, what it is thou haſt heard, and ſay, whether the name of the Saviour, whoſe meſſage it is, may not well be called, "Wonderful Counſellor, Iſa. 9, 6," when he diſplays before thee ſuch wonders of love, and propoſes to thee ſuch counſels of peace!</p>
                  <p>Bleſſed Jeſus, is it indeed thus! Is it not the fiction of the human mind? ſurely it is not! What human mind could have invented or conceived it? Is it a plain certain fact, that thou didſt leave the magnificence and joy of the heavenly world in compaſſion to ſuch a wretch as I? Oh, hadſt thou from that height of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and felicity only looked down upon me for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſent ſome gracious word to me for my di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and comfort even by the leaſt of thy ſervants, juſtly and might I have proſtrated myſelf in grateful admiration, and have kiſſed the very footſteps of him that publiſhed ſalvation, Iſa. 52, 7. But didſt thou condeſcend to be thyſelf the meſſenger! What grace had that been though thou hadſt but once in perſon made the declaration, and immediately returned back to the throne, from whence divine compaſſion brought thee down? But this is not all the triumph of thine il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious grace: it not only brought thee down to earth, but kept thee here in a frail and wretched tabernacle for long ſucceſſive years, and at length it coſt thee thy life, and ſtretched thee out as a malefactor upon the croſs, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter thou haſt borne inſult and cruelty, which it may juſtly wound my heart ſo much as to think of: and thus thou haſt atoned injured juſtice, and <q>redeemed me to God with thine own blood, Rev. 5, 9.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>What ſhall I ſay? <q>Lord I believe, help thou mine unbelief, Mark 9, 24.</q> It ſeems to put faith to the ſtretch to admit what it indeed exceeds the utmoſt ſtretch of imagination to conceive. Bleſſed, for ever bleſſed be thy name, O thou Father of mercies, that thou haſt

contrived the way? Eternal thanks to the Lamb that was ſlain, and to that kind Providence that ſent the word or this ſalvation to me! Oh let me not for ten thouſand worlds "receive this grace of God in vain! 2 Cor. 6, 1." Oh impreſs this goſpel upon my ſoul, till its ſaving virtue be diffuſed over every faculty! Let it not only be heard, and acknowledged, and profeſſed, but felt!

                  <p>I feel a ſudden glow in mine heart while theſe tidings are ſounding in mine ears; but, Oh! let it not be a ſlight ſuperficial tranſport! Oh let not this which I would fain call my Chriſtian joy be as that fooliſh laughter with which I have been ſo madly enchanted <q>like the crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling blaze of thorns under a pot! Eccleſ. 7, 6.</q> O teach me to ſecure this mighty bleſſing, this glorious hope, in the method which thou haſt appointed! and preſerve me from miſtaking the joy of nature, while it catches a glimpſe of its reſcue from deſtruction, for that conſent of grace which embraces and inſures the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>An inquiry into the way of ſalvation by Chriſt being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, § <hi>1.</hi> The ſinner is in general directed to repentance and faith, § <hi>2;</hi> and urged to give up all ſelfdependence, § <hi>3;</hi> and to ſeek ſalvation by free grace, § <hi>4.</hi> A ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of more particular directions is propoſed, § <hi>5.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">§ 1. I NOW conſider you, my dear reader, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me with the enquiry which the Jews once addreſſed to our Lord. "What ſhall we do that we may work the works of God, John 6, 28?" what method ſhall I take to ſecure that redemption and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which I am told Chriſt has procured for his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? I would anſwer it as ſeriouſly and carefully as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as one that knows of what importance it is to you to be rightly informed; and that knows alſo how ſtrictly he is to anſwer to God for the ſincerity and care with which the reply is made. May I be enabled to "ſpeak as his oracle, 1 Pet. 4, 11." that is, in ſuch a manner as faithfully to echo back what the ſacred o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles teach!</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. And here, that I may be ſure to follow the ſafeſt guides, and the faireſt examples, I muſt preach ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to you, in the way of <q>repentance towards God, and of faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Acts 20, 21;</q> that Good old doctrine which the apoſtles preached, and which no man can pretend to change, but at the peril of his own ſoul and of theirs who attend to him.</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. I ſuppoſe that you are by this time convinced of your guilt and condemnation, and of your own ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to recover yourſelf. Let me, nevertheleſs, urge you to feel that conviction yet more deeply, and to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it with yet greater weight upon your ſoul; that you have "undone yourſelf," and that <q>in yourſelf is not your help found, Hoſea 13, 9.</q> Be perſuaded, therefore, expreſsly and ſolemnly, and ſincerely, to give up all ſelf-dependence, which, if you do not guard againſt it, will be ready to return ſecretly, before it is obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and will lead you to attempt building up what you have juſt been deſtroying.</p>
               <p n="4">§ 4. Be aſſured, that if ever you are ſaved, you muſt aſcribe that ſalvation entirely to the free grace of God. If, guilty and miſerable as you are, you are not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:021060_0092_0FB210257332B080"/>
but crowned, you muſt "lay down your crown," with all humble acknowledgment, before the throne Rev. 4, 10. <q>No fleſh muſt glory in his preſence; but he that glorieth muſt glory in the Lord: for of him are we in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdom, and righteouſneſs, and ſanctification, and redemption, 1 Cor. 1.29,—31.</q> and you muſt be ſenſible you are in ſuch a ſtate, as having none of theſe in yourſelf, to need them in another. You muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſenſible that you are ignorant and guilty, pollut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and enſlaved; or, as our Lord expreſſes it, (with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to ſome that were under a Chriſtian profeſſion,) that, as a ſinner, <q>you are wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked, Rev. 3, 17.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="5">§ 5. If theſe views be deeply impreſſed upon your mind, you will be prepared to receive what I am now to ſay. Hear, therefore, in a few words, your duty, your remedy, and your ſafety, which conſiſts in this, <q>That you muſt apply to Chriſt with a deep abhorrence of your former ſins, and a firm reſolution of forſaking them; forming that reſolution in the ſtrength of his grace, and fixing your dependence on him for your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with God, even while you are purpoſing to do your very beſt; and when you have actually done the beſt you ever will do in conſequence of that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">§ 6. The firſt and moſt important advice that I can give you in the preſent circumſtances is, That "you look to Chriſt, and apply yourſelf to him." And here, "ſay not in your heart, Who ſhall aſcend into heaven, to bring him down to me Rom. 10, 6?" or, Who ſhall raiſe me up thither to preſent me before him? The bleſſed Jeſus, "by whom all things conſiſt Col. 1, 17." by whom the whole ſyſtem of them is ſupported, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten as he is by moſt that bear his name, "is not far from any of us "Acts 17, 27;" nor could he have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to have been, <q>wherever two or three are met together in his name Mat. 18, 20,</q> but in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of thoſe truly divine perfections by which he is every where preſent. Would you therefore, O ſinner, deſire to be ſaved? go to the Saviour: would you deſire
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:021060_0093_0FB2102AF25383B0"/>
to be delivered, look to that great Deliverer; and though you ſhould be overwhelmed with guilt, and ſhame, and fear, and horror, that you ſhould be incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſpeaking to him, fall down in this ſpeechleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion at his feet, and <q>behold him, as the Lamb "of God, that taketh away the ſin of the world John 1, 29.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="7">§ 7. Behold him therefore with an attentive eye, and ſay whether the ſight does not touch, and even melt, thy very heart? Doſt thou not feel what a fooliſh and what a wretched creature thou haſt been, that for the ſake of ſuch low and ſordid gratifications and intereſts as thoſe which thou haſt been purſuing, thou ſhouldſt thus <q>kill the Prince of life Acts 3, 15.</q> Behold the deep wounds which he bore for thee. <q>Look on him whom thou haſt pierced, and ſurely thou muſt mourn Zech. 12, 10,</q> unleſs thine heart be hardened into ſtone. Which of thy paſt ſins canſt thou reflect upon, and ſay, "For this it was worth my while thus to have injured my Saviour, and to have expoſed the Son of God to ſuch ſufferings!" And what future temptations can a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe ſo conſiderable, that thou ſhouldeſt ſay, <q>For the ſake of this I will crucify my Lord again Heb. 6, 6?</q> Sinner, thou muſt repent; thou muſt repent of every ſin, and muſt forſake it; but if thou doſt it to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I well know it muſt be as at the foot of the croſs. Thou muſt ſacrifice every luſt, even the deareſt tho' it ſhould be like a right hand, or a right eye Mat. 5.29.30; and therefore, that thou mayeſt, if poſſible, be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imated to it, I have led thee to that altar, on which <q>Chriſt himſelf was ſacrificed for thee, an offering of a ſweet-ſmelling ſavour Eph. 5, 2. Thou muſt yield up thyſelf to God, as one alive from the dead Rom. 6, 13;</q> and therefore I have ſhowed thee at what a price he purchaſed thee: <q>For thou waſt not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſilver and gold, but with the precious blood of the Son of God, that Lamb without blemiſh and without ſpot 1 Pet. 1, 18.19.</q> And now I would aſk thee, as before the Lord, what does thine own heart ſay to it? Art thou grieved for thy former offences? art thou willing to
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:021060_0094_0FB2102C9C3E8F70"/>
forſake thy ſins? art thou willing to become the chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, thankful ſervant of him, <q>who hath purchaſed thee with his own blood?</q>
               </p>
               <p n="8">§ 8. I will ſuppoſe ſuch a purpoſe as this riſing in thine heart: how determinate it is, and how effectual it may be, I know not; what different views may ariſe hereafter, or how ſoon the preſent ſenſe may wear off: but this I aſſuredly know, that thou wilt never ſee reaſon to change theſe views; for however thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt alter, the Lord <q>Jeſus Chriſt is the ſame yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, to-day, and forever Heb. 13, 8:</q> and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that now recommend repentance and faith, as fit and as neceſſary, will continue invariable, as long as the perfections of the bleſſed God are the ſame, and as long as his Son continues the ſame.</p>
               <p n="9">§ 9. But while you have theſe views and theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, I muſt remind you, that this is not all that is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to your ſalvation. You muſt not only purpoſe, but, as God gives opportunity, you muſt act as thoſe who are convinced of the evil of ſin, and of the neceſſity and excellence of holineſs: and that you may be enabled to do ſo in other inſtances, you muſt, in the firſt place, and as the firſt great work of God, (as our Lord himſelf calls it,) <q>believe in him whom God hath ſent John 6, 29.</q> You muſt confide in him; <q>muſt commit your ſoul into the hands of Chriſt, to be ſaved by him in his own appointed method of ſalvation.</q> This is the great act of ſaving faith; and I pray God that you may experimentally know what it means, ſo as to be able to ſay with the apoſtle Paul, in the near view of death itſelf, <q>I know whom I have believed, and am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him until that day, 2 Tim. 1, 12;</q> that great deciſive day, which, if we are Chriſtians, we have always in view. To this I would urge you; and oh that I could be ſo happy as to engage you to it while I am illuſtrating it in this and the following ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes! Be aſſured you muſt not apply yourſelves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to God, as abſolutely or in himſelf conſidered, in the neglect of a Mediator. It will neither be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to him, nor ſafe for you, to ruſh into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence

               <p n="10">§ 10. Apply therefore to this glorious Redeemer, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable, (as he will appear to every believing eye,) in the blood which he ſhed upon the croſs, and in the wounds which he received there. Go to him, O ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, this day, this moment, with all thy ſins about thee. Go juſt as thou art; for if thou wilt never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to him till thou art firſt righteous and holy, thou wilt never be righteous and holy at all; nor canſt be ſo, on this ſuppoſition, unleſs there were ſome way of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo without him, and then there would be no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for applying to him for righteouſneſs and holineſs.

under a ſentence of everlaſting deſtruction; a deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which will be aggravated by all the contempt which I have caſt upon thee, O thou bleeding Lamb of God; for I cannot, and will not, diſſemble it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thee, that I have wronged thee, moſt baſely and ungratefully wronged thee, under the character of a Saviour as well as of a Lord: but now I am willing to ſubmit to thee; and I have brought my poor trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſoul to lodge it in thine hands, if thou wilt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to receive it, and if thou doſt not it muſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.

O Lord, I have fooliſhly attempted to be mine own ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, but it will not do: I am ſenſible the attempt is vain; and therefore I give it over, and look unto thee. On thee, bleſſed Jeſus, who art ſure and ſtedfaſt, do I deſire to fix my anchor: on thee, as the only ſure foundation, would I build my eternal hopes: to thy teaching, O thou unerring Prophet of the Lord, would I ſubmit: be thy doctrines ever ſo myſterious, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for me that thou thyſelf haſt ſaid it: to thine atonement, obedience and interceſſion, O thou holy and ever acceptable High-Prieſt, would I truſt: and to thy government, O thou exalted Sovereign, would I yield a willing, delightful ſubjection. In token of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence and love, I "kiſs the Son; Pſalm 2, 12." I kiſs the ground before his feet: I admit thee, O my Saviour, and welcome thee with unutterable joy, to the throne in my heart: aſcend it, and reign there for ever! ſubdue mine enemies, O Lord, for they are thine; and make me thy faithful, thy zealous ſervant; faithful to death, and zealous to eternity!"</p>

life too. The unmeaning words of the lips would be a vain mockery. The moſt affectionate tranſport of the paſſions, ſhould it be tranſient and ineffectual, would be but like a blaze of ſtraw preſented inſtead of incenſe at his altar. With ſuch humility, with ſuch love, with ſuch cordial ſelf dedication and ſubmiſſion of ſoul, muſt thou often proſtrate thyſelf in the preſence of Chriſt: and then thou muſt go away, and keep him in thy view; muſt go away, and live unto God through him, "denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts," and behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thyſelf <q>ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly, in this vain enſnaring world, Tit. 2, 12.</q> You muſt make it your care to ſhew your love by obedience; by form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing yourſelf as much as poſſible according to the temper and manner of Jeſus, in whom you believe. You muſt make it the great point of your ambition, (and a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler view you cannot entertain) to be a living image of Chriſt; that, ſo far as circumſtances will allow, even thoſe who have heard and read but little of him may, by obſerving you, in ſome meaſure ſee and know what kind of a life that of the bleſſed Jeſus was. And this muſt be your conſtant care, your prevailing character, as long as you live. You muſt follow him whitherſoever he leads you; muſt follow him with a croſs on your ſhoulder, when he commands you to <q>take it up; Matth. 16, 24; and ſo muſt be faithful even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to death, expecting the crown of life, Rev. 2, 10.</q>

               <p n="12">§ 12. This, ſo far as I have been able to learn from the word of God, is the way to ſafety and glory; the ſureſt, the only way you can take. It is the way which every faithful miniſter of Chriſt has trod, and is tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the way to which, as he tenders the ſalvation of his own ſoul, he muſt direct others. We cannot, we would not, alter it in favour of ourſelves, or of our dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt friends. It is the way in which alone, ſo far as we can judge, it becomes the bleſſed God to ſave his apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate creatures. And therefore, reader, I beſeech and intreat you ſeriouſly to conſider it; and let your own conſcience anſwer, as in the preſence of God, whether you are willing to acquieſce in it or not.

To give up every darling luſt, tho' dear to me as a right eye, and ſeemingly neceſſary as a right hand? to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, not only my life, but my heart, to the command and diſcipline of another! To have a Maſter there, and ſuch a Maſter as will controul many of its favourite affections, and direct them quite into another channel! A maſter, who himſelf repreſents his commands by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the croſs and following him! To adhere to the ſtricteſt rules of godlineſs and ſobriety, of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and truth; not departing from them, in any allowed inſtance, great or ſmall, upon any temptation, for any advantage, to eſcape any inconvenience and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, no, not even for the preſervation of life itſelf; but, upon a proper call of providence, to act as if <q>I hated even my own life! Luke xiv, 26.</q> Lord, it is hard to fleſh and blood: and yet I perceive and feel there is one demand yet harder than this</p>
                  <p>With all theſe precautions, with all theſe mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the pride of my nature would find ſome inward reſource of pleaſure, might I but ſecretly think that I had been my own ſaviour; that my own wiſdom and my own reſolution had broken the bands and chains of the enemy; and that I had drawn out of my own trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures the price with which my redemption was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed. But muſt I lie down before another, as guilty and condemned, as weak and helpleſs? and muſt the
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:021060_0099_0FB20E6D14499698"/>
obligation be multiplied, and muſt a Mediator have his ſhare too? muſt I go to the croſs for my ſalvation, and ſeek my glory from the infamy of that? muſt I be ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of every pleaſing pretence to righteouſneſs, and ſtand in this reſpect upon a level with the vileſt of men? ſtand at the bar among the greateſt criminals, pleading guilty with them, and ſeeking deliverance by that very act of grace whereby they have obtained it?</p>
                  <p>I dare not deliberately ſay this method is unreaſonable. My conſcience teſtifies that I have ſinned, and cannot be juſtified before God as an innocent and obedient crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. My conſcience tells me that all theſe humbling circumſtances are fit: that it is fit a convicted criminal ſhould be brought upon his knees; that a captive rebel ſhould give up the weapons of his rebellion, and bow before his ſovereign, if he expects his life. Yea, my reaſon as well as my conſcience, tells me, that it is fit and neceſſary that, if I am ſaved at all, I ſhould be ſaved from the power and love of ſin, as well as from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of it; and that, if ſovereign mercy gives me a new life, after having deſerved eternal death, it is moſt fit I ſhould <q>yield myſelf to God as alive from the dead, Rom. 6, 13." But, Oh wretched man that I am, I feel a law in my members that wars againſt the law of my mind, Rom. 7, 23. 24</q>, and oppoſes the conviction of my reaſon and conſcience. Who ſhall deliver me from this bondage? who ſhall make me willing to do that which I know in my own ſoul to be moſt expedient? O Lord ſubdue my heart, and let it not be drawn ſo ſtrongly one way, while the nobler powers of my mind would direct it another! Conquer every licentious principle within, that it may be my joy to be wiſely governed and reſtrained! eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſubdue my pride, that lordly corruption which ſo ill ſuits an impoveriſhed and condemned creature; that thy way of ſalvation may be amiable to me, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the degree in which it is humbling! I feel a diſpoſition to <q>linger in Sodom, but, oh, be merciful to me, and pull me out of it, Gen. 19, 16,</q> before the ſtorms of thy flaming vengeance fall, and there be no more eſcaping!</p>

               <head>CHAP. X. The Sinner ſeriouſly urged and intreated to accept of Salvation in this way.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>Since many, who have been impreſſed with theſe things, ſuffer the impreſſion to wear off in vain, § <hi>1.</hi> Strongly as the caſe ſpeaks for itſelf, ſinners are to be intreated to accept this ſalvation, § <hi>2.</hi> Accordingly the reader is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated. <hi>(1.)</hi> By the Majeſty and mercy of God, § <hi>3. (2.)</hi> By the dying love of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, § <hi>4. (3.)</hi> By the regard due to fellow creatures, § <hi>5. (4.)</hi> By the worth of his own immortal ſoul, § <hi>6.</hi> The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is ſolemnly left with the reader, as before God, § <hi>7.</hi> The ſinner yielding to theſe intreaties, and declaring his acceptance of ſalvation by Chriſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THUS far have I often known convictions and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions to ariſe, (if I might judge by the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt appearances,) which, after all, have worn off again, Some unhappy circumſtance of external temptation, ever joined by the inward reluctance of an unſanctified heart, to this holy and humbling ſcheme of redemption, has been the ruin of multitudes. And <q>through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of ſin, they have been hardened, Heb. 3, 13, till they ſeem to have been utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and that without remedy, Prov. 29, 1.</q> And therefore, O thou immortal creature, who art now reading theſe lines, I beſeech thee, that while affairs are in this critical ſituation; while there are theſe ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancings of mind between accepting and rejecting that glorious goſpel, which, in the integrity of my heart, I have now been laying before you, you would once more give me an attentive audience, while I plead in God's behalf (ſhall I ſay?) or rather in your own; while <q>as an ambaſſador for Chriſt, and as tho' God did beſeech you by me, I pray you in Chriſt's ſtead, that you would be reconciled to God, 2 Cor. 5, 20;</q> and would not, after theſe awakenings, and theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, be a madneſs, which it will ſurely be the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:021060_0101_0FB20E7096A0BD68"/>
buſineſs of a miſerable eternity to lament, reject this compaſſionate counſel of God towards you.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. One would, indeed, imagine there ſhould be no need of importunity here. One would conclude, that as ſoon as periſhing ſinners are told that an offending God is ready to be reconciled; that he offers them a full pardon for all their aggravated ſins; yea, that he is willing to adopt them into his family now, that he may at length admit them to his heavenly preſence; all ſhould, with the utmoſt readineſs and pleaſure, embrace ſo kind a meſſage, and fall at his feet in ſpeechleſs tranſports of aſtoniſhment, gratitude and joy. But, alas! we find it much otherwiſe. We ſee multitudes quite unmoved, and the impreſſions which are made on many more, are feeble and tranſient. Leſt it ſhould be thus with you, O reader, let me urge the meſſage with which I have the honour to be charged: let me entreat you to be reconciled to God, and to accept of pardon and ſalvation in the way in which it is ſo freely offered to you.</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. I intreat you, by the majeſty of that God, in whoſe name I come; whoſe voice fills all heaven with reverence and obedience. He ſpeaks not in vain to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of angels; but if there could be any contention a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe bleſſed ſpirits, it would be, who ſhould be firſt to execute his commands. O let him not ſpeak in vain to a wretched mortal! I intreat you <q>by the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of his wrath,</q> who could ſpeak to you in thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; who could<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by one ſingle act of his will, cut off this precarious life of yours, and ſend you down to hell. I beſeech you by his mercies, by his tender mercies; by the bowels of his compaſſion which ſtill earn over you, as thoſe of a parent over a dear ſon, over a tender child, whom, notwithſtanding his former ungrateful rebellions, "he earneſtly remembers ſtill, Jer. 31, 20." I beſeech and intreat you, by all this paternal goodneſs, that you do not (as it were) compel him to loſe the character of the gentle parent in that of the righteous judge; ſo that (as he threatens with regard to thoſe whom he had juſt called his ſons and his daughters) <q>a fire ſhould be kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in his anger, which ſhould burn unto the loweſt hell, Deut. 32, 19.22.</q>

                  <pb n="89" facs="unknown:021060_0102_0FB20E745BA70A60"/>§ 4. I beſeech you farther, by the name and love of our dying Saviour; I beſeech you by all the condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his incarnation; by that poverty to which he vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily ſubmitted, that you might be enriched with eternal treaſures, 2 Cor. 8, 9; by all the gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations which he gave, which ſtill ſound in his word, and ſtill coming (as it were) warm from his heart <q>are ſweeter than honey, or the honey comb, Pſ. 19, 10.</q> I beſeech you by all his glorious works of power and wonder, which were alſo works of love. I beſeech you by the memory of the moſt benevolent perſon, and the moſt generous friend. I beſeech you by the memory of what he ſuffered, as well as of what he ſaid and did; by the agony which he endured in the garden, when his body was covered <q>with a dew of blood, Luke 22, 44.</q> I beſeech you by all that tender diſtreſs which he felt, when his deareſt friends <q>forſook him and fled, Matt. 26, 56</q> and his blood thirſty enemies dragged him away, like the meaneſt of ſlaves, and like the vileſt of criminals. I beſeech you by the blows and bruiſes, by the ſtripes and laſhes, which this injured Sovereign endured while in their rebellious hands; by the ſhame of ſpitting, from which he hid not that kind and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable countenance, Iſa. 50, 6. I beſeech you by the purple robe, the ſceptre of reed, and the crown of thorns, which this King of glory wore, that he might ſet us among the princes of heaven, Pſalm 113, 8. I beſeech you by the heavy burden of the croſs, under which he panted, and toiled, and fainted, in the pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful way to Golgotha, John 19, 17, that he might free us from the burden of our ſins. I beſeech you by the remembrance of thoſe rude nails that tore the veins and arteries, the nerves and tendons, of his ſacred hands and feet; and by that invincible, that triumphant good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which, while the iron pierced his fleſh, engaged him to cry out, <q>Father forgive them for they know not what they do, Luke 22, 34.</q> I beſeech you by the unutterable anguiſh which he bore when lifted up upon the croſs, and extended there as on a rack, for ſix painful hours, that you open your heart to thoſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive influences, which have drawn to him thouſands
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:021060_0103_0FB20E75DC80AD38"/>
and ten thouſands, John 13, 32. I beſeech you by all that inſult and deriſion which the Lord of glory bore there, Matt. 27, 29—44; by that parching thirſt, which could hardly obtain the relief of vinegar, John 19, 28.29; by that doleful cry, ſo aſtoniſhing in the mouth of the only begotten of the Father, <q>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? Matt. 27, 46.</q> I beſeech you by the grace that ſubdued and pardoned a dying ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactor, Luke 23, 42.43; by that compaſſion for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, by that compaſſion for you, which wrought in his heart, long as its vital motion continued, and which ended not when he <q>bowed his head, ſaying, It is finiſhed, and gave up the ghoſt, John 19, 30.</q> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you by the triumphs of that reſurrection, by which he was <q>declared to be the Son of God with power, by the Spirit of holineſs,</q> which wrought to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it, Rom. 1, 4; by that gracious tenderneſs which attempered all thoſe triumphs, when he ſaid to <q>her out of whom he had caſt ſeven devils,</q> concerning his diſciples who had treated him ſo baſely, <q>Go, tell my brother, I aſcend unto my Father and your Father, unto my God and your God, John 20, 17.</q> I beſeech you by that condeſcenſion with which he ſaid to Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, when his unbelief had ſuch an unreaſonable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, <q>Reach hither thy finger and behold my hands, and reach thither thine hand, and put it into my ſide; and be not faithleſs but believing, John 20, 27.</q> I beſeech you by that generous and faithful care of his people, which he carried up with him to the regions of glory, and which engaged him to ſend down his Spirit, in that rich profuſion of miraculous gifts, to ſpread the progreſs of his ſaving word, Acts 2, 33. I beſeech you by that voice of ſympathy and power with which he ſaid to Saul, while injuring his church, <q>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me? Acts 9, 4.</q> by that generous goodneſs which ſpared that proſtrate enemy, when he lay trembling at his feet, and raiſed him to ſuch a dignity as to be not inferior to the very chiefeſt apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, 2 Cor. 12, 11. I beſeech you by the memory of all that Chriſt hath already done, by the expectation of all he will farther do, for his people. I beſeech you at
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:021060_0104_0FB20E77815E7E90"/>
once, by the ſceptre of his grace, and by that ſword of his juſtice, with which all his incorrigible enemies ſhall be "ſlain before him, Luke 19, 27," that you do not "trifle away theſe precious moments while his Spirit is thus breathing upon you, that you do not loſe an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity which may never return, and on the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which your eternity depends.</p>
               <p n="5">§ 5. I beſeech you by all the bowels of compaſſion which you owe to the faithful miniſters of Chriſt, who are ſtudying and labouring, preaching and praying, wearing out their time, exhauſting their ſtrength, and, very probably, ſhortening their lives, for the ſalvation of your ſoul, and of ſouls like yours. I beſeech you by the affection with which all that love our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in ſincerity, long to ſee you brought back to him. I beſeech you by the friendſhip of the living, and by the memory of the dead; by the ruin of thoſe who have trifled away their days, and are periſhed in their ſins, and by the happineſs of thoſe who have embraced the goſpel, and are ſaved by it. I beſeech you by the great expectation of that important day, <q>when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from heaven, 2 Theſſ. 1, 7;</q> by "the terrors of a diſſolving world 2 Pet. 3, 10;" by "the ſound of the arch-angel's trumpet," and of that infinitely more awful ſentence, "Come ye, bleſſed," and "Depart, ye curſed," with which that grand ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity ſhall cloſe, Matt. 25, 34.41.</p>
               <p n="6">§ 6. I beſeech you, finally, by your own precious, and immortal ſoul; by the ſure proſpect of a dying bed or a ſudden ſurpriſe into the inviſible ſtate; and as you would feel one ſparkle of comfort in your departing ſpirit, when "your fleſh and your heart are failing." I beſeech you by your own perſonal appearance before the tribunal of Chriſt, (for a perſonal appearance it muſt be, even to them who now ſit on thrones of their own;) by all the tranſports of the bleſſed, and by all the ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of the damned, the one or the other, of which muſt be your everlaſting portion. I affectionately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat and beſeech you, in the ſtrength of all theſe united conſiderations, as you will anſwer it to me, who may, in that day, be ſummoned to teſtify againſt you; and, which is unſpeakably more, as you will anſwer it to your
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:021060_0105_0FB20E7C9A742BC8"/>
own conſcience, as you will anſwer it to the eternal Judge: that you diſmiſs not theſe thoughts, theſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and theſe cares, till you have brought matters to a happy iſſue; till you have made a reſolute choice of Chriſt, and his appointed way of ſalvation, and till you have ſolemnly devoted yourſelf to God in the bonds of an everlaſting covenant.</p>
               <p n="7">§ 7. And thus I leave the matter before you, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord. I have told you my errand, I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged my embaſſy. Stronger arguments I cannot uſe; more endearing and more awful conſiderations I cannot ſuggeſt. Chuſe, therefore, whether you will go out (as it were) clothed in ſackcloth, to caſt yourſelf at the feet of him who now ſends you theſe equitable and gracious terms of peace and pardon, or, whether you will hold it out till he appears, ſword in hand, to reckon with you for your treaſons and your crimes, and for this neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed embaſſy among the reſt of them? Fain would I hope the beſt; nor can I believe that this labour of love ſhall be ſo entirely unſucceſsful, that not one ſoul ſhall be brought to the foot of Chriſt in cordial ſubmiſſion and humble faith. <q>Take with you, therefore, words, and turn unto the Lord, Hoſ. 14, 2;</q>, and, on that thoſe which follow might, in effect at leaſt, be the genuine language of every one that reads them.</p>

Here, therefore, we muſt part; in this chapter I muſt take my leave of them; and, oh, that I could do it in ſuch a manner as to fix, at parting, ſome convictions upon their hearts; that, though I ſeem to leave them for a little while, and ſend them back to review again the former chapters, as thoſe in which alone they have any preſent concern, they might ſoon, as it were, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take me again, and find a ſuitableneſs in the remaining part of this diſcourſe, which at preſent they cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly find. Unhappy creatures! I quit you, as a phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian quits a patient whom he loves, and is juſt about to give over as incurable; he returns again and again, and re-examines the ſeveral ſymptoms, to obſerve whether there be not ſome one of them more favourable than the reſt, which may encourage a renewed application.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. So would I once more return to you. You do not find in yourſelf any diſpoſition to embrace the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to apply yourſelf to Chriſt, to give yourſelf up to the ſervice of God, and to make religion the buſineſs of your life. But, if I cannot prevail upon you to do this, let me engage you at leaſt to anſwer me, or rather to anſwer your own conſcience, <q>Why you will not do it?</q> Is it owing to any ſecret diſbelief of the great principles of religion? If it be, the caſe is different from what I have yet conſidered, and the cure muſt be differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent. This is not a place to combat with the ſcruples of infidelity. Nevertheleſs, I would deſire you ſeriouſly to inquire how far thoſe ſcruples extend. Do they affect only ſome particular doctrines of the goſpel on which my argument hath turned? or do they affect the whole Chriſtian revelation? or do they reach yet farther, and extend themſelves to natural religion as well as revealed, ſo that it ſhould be a doubt with you whether there be any God, and Providence, and future ſtate, or not? As theſe caſes are all different, ſo it will be of great importance to diſtinguiſh the one from the other, that you may know on what principle to build as certain, in the examination of thoſe concerning which you are yet in doubt. But, whatever theſe doubts are, I would farther aſk you, How long have they continued, and what method have you taken to get them reſolved? Do
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:021060_0109_0FB20E8363CB9EB8"/>
you imagine that in matters of ſuch moment, it will be an allowable caſe for you to trifle on, neglecting to inquire into the evidence of theſe things, and then plead your not being ſatisfied in that evidence, as an excuſe for not acting according to them? Muſt not the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of common ſenſe aſſure you that, if theſe things be true, (as when you talk of doubting about them, you acknowledge it, at leaſt poſſibly they may,) they are of infinitely greater importance than any of the affairs of life, whether of buſineſs or pleaſure, for the ſake of which you neglect them? Why then do you continue indolent and unconcerned, from week to week, and from month to month, which, probably, conſcience tells you is the caſe?</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. Do you aſk what method you ſhould take to be reſolved? It is no hard queſtion. Open your eyes; ſet yourſelf to think: let conſcience ſpeak, and verily do I believe that, if it be not feared in an uncommon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, you will find ſhrewd forebodings of the certainty both of natural and revealed religion, and of the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity of repentance, faith, and holineſs, to a life of future felicity. If you are a perſon of any learning, you cannot but know by what writers, and in what treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſes, theſe great truths are defended. And, if you are not, you may find, in almoſt every town and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, perſons capable of informing you in the main evidences of Chriſtianity, and of anſwering ſuch ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples againſt it as unlearned minds may have met with. Set yourſelf then, in the name of God, immediately to conſider the matter. If you ſtudy at all, bend your ſtudies cloſe this way; and trifle not with mathematics, or poetry, or hiſtory, or law, or phyſic, (which are all, comparatively light as a feather,) while you neglect this. Study the argument as for your life; for much more than life depends on it. See how far you are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and why that ſatisfaction reaches no farther. Compare evidences on both ſides. And, above all, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the deſign and tendency of the New Teſtament, to what it would lead you, and all them that cordially obey it; and then ſay whether it be not good. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how naturally its truth is connected with its good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

Trace the character and ſentiments of its authors, whoſe living image, (if I may be allowed the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) is ſtill preſerved in their writings; and then aſk your own heart, Can you think this was a forgery? an impious cruel forgery? For ſuch it muſt have been if it were a forgery at all, a ſcheme to mock God, and to ruin men, even the beſt of men, ſuch as reverenced conſcience and would abide all extremeties for what they apprehended to be truth. Put the queſtion to your own heart, Can I in my conſcience believe it to be ſuch an impoſture? Can I look up to an omniſcient God, and ſay, <q>O Lord, thou knoweſt that it is in reverence to thee, and in love to truth and virtue, that I reject this book, and the method to happineſs here laid down?</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">§ 4. But there are difficulties in the way.—And what then? Have thoſe difficulties never been cleared? Go to the living advocates for Chriſtianity, to thoſe of whoſe abilities, candour, and piety, you have the beſt opinion, if your prejudices will give you leave to have a good o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of any ſuch: tell them your difficulties; hear their ſolutions; weigh them ſeriouſly, as thoſe who know they muſt anſwer it to God; and, while doubts continue, follow the truth as far as it will lead you, and take heed that you do not <q>impriſon it in unrighteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Rom. 1, 18.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing appears more inconſiſtent and abſurd than for a man ſolemnly to pretend diſſatisfaction in the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the goſpel, as a reaſon why he cannot in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience be a thorough Chriſtian; when yet at the ſame time he violates the moſt apparent dictates of reaſon and conſcience, and lives in vices condemned even by the Heathens. Oh ſirs! Chriſt has judged concerning ſuch, and judged moſt righteouſly and moſt wiſely; <q>They do evil, and therefore they hate the light, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther come they to the light, leſt their deeds ſhould be made manifeſt, and be reproved, John 3, 20.</q> But there is a light that will make manifeſt and reprove their works, to which they ſhall be compelled to come, and the painful ſcrutiny of which they ſhall be forced to abide.</p>

no farther into the matter now, give me leave at leaſt, from a ſincere concern, that you may not heap upon your head more aggravated ruin, to intreat you that you would be cautious how you expoſe yourſelf to get greater danger by what you muſt yourſelf own to be unneceſſary, I mean attempts to pervert others from believing the truth of the goſpel. Leave them, for God's ſake, and for your own, in poſſeſſion of thoſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and thoſe hopes, which nothing but Chriſtianity can give them, and act not as if you were ſolicitous to add to the guilt of an infidel the tenfold damnation, which they who have been the perverters and deſtroyers of the ſouls of others muſt expect to meet, if that goſpel, which they have ſo adventurouſly oppoſed, ſhould prove, as it certainly will, a ſerious, and to them a dreadful truth.</p>
               <p n="6">§ 6. If I cannot prevail here, but the pride of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing a ſuperiority of underſtanding ſhould bear on ſuch a reader, even in oppoſition to his own favourite maxims of the innocence of terror, and the equality of all religions conſiſtent with ſocial virtue, to do his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to trample down the goſpel with contempt, I would, however, diſmiſs him with one propoſal, which I think the importance of the affair may fully juſtify. If you have done with your examination into Chriſtianity, and determine to live and conduct yourſelf as if it were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly falſe, ſit down then and make a memorandum of that determination. Write it down: <q>On ſuch a day of ſuch a year, I deliberately reſolved that I would live and die rejecting Chriſtianity myſelf, and doing all I could to overthrow it.</q> This day I determined not only to renounce all ſubjection to, and expectation from Jeſus of Nazareth, but alſo to make it a ſerious part of the buſineſs of my life to deſtroy, as far as I poſſibly can, all regard to him in the minds of others, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert my moſt vigorous efforts in the way of reaſoning, or of ridicule, to ſink the credit of his religion, and if it be poſſibly, to root it out of the world; in calm ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy defiance of that day, when his followers ſay, He ſhall appear in ſo much majeſty and terror, to execute the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance threatened to his enemies. Dare you write this and ſign it? I firmly believe that many a man, who
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:021060_0112_0FB20E8A31C1ABC0"/>
would be thought a Deiſt, and endeavours to encreaſe the number, would not: and if you in particular dare not to do it, whence does that ſmall remainder of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſe? the cauſe is plain. There is in your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſome ſecret apprehenſion that this rejected, this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, this derided goſpel may, after all prove true; and if there be ſuch an apprehenſion, then let conſcience do its office, and convict you of the impious madneſs of acting as if it were moſt certainly and demonſtrably falſe. Let it tell you at large how poſſible it is that <q>happily you may be found fighting againſt God, Act. 5, 39:</q> that, bold as you are, in defying the terrors of the Lord, you may poſſibly fall into his hands, may chance to hear that deſpiſed ſentence, which, when you hear it from the mouth of the eternal Judge, you will not be able to deſpiſe: I will repeat it again in ſpite of all your ſcorn, you may hear the King ſay to you, <q>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part accurſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels, Matth. 25, 41.</q> And now go and pervert and burleſque the ſcripture, go and lampoon the character of its heroes, and ridicule the ſublime diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of its prophets and its apoſtles, as ſome have done who have left little behind them but the ſhort-lived monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their ignorance, their profaneneſs, and their malice: go and ſpread like them the banners of Infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and pride thyſelf in the number of credulous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures liſted under them. But take heed leſt the inſulted Galilean direct a ſecret arrow to thine heart, and ſtop thy licentious breath before it has finiſhed the next ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence thou wouldſt utter againſt him.</p>
               <p n="7">§ 7. I will now turn myſelf from the Deiſt or the Sceptic, and direct my addreſs to the nominal Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian; if he may upon any terms be called a Chriſtian, who feels not, after all I have pleaded, a diſpoſition to ſubject himſelf to the government and the grace of that Saviour whoſe name he bears. O ſinner, thou art turning away from my Lord, in whoſe cauſe I ſpeak; but let me earneſtly entreat thee ſeriouſly to conſider why thou art turning away, <q>and to whom thou wilt go from him, whom thou acknowledgeſt to have the words of eternal life, John 6.68.</q> You call yourſelf a Chriſtian, and yet will not by any means be

perſuaded to ſeek ſalvation in good earneſt from and through Jeſus Chriſt, whom you call your Maſter and your Lord. How do you for a moment excuſe this negligence to your own conſcience? If I had urged you on any controverted point, it might have altered the caſe. If I had laboured hard to make you the diſciple of any particular party of Chriſtians, your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay might have been more reaſonable: nay, perhaps, your refuſing to acquieſce might have been an act of apprehended duty to our common Maſter. But is it matter of controverſy among Chriſtians, whether there be a great, holy, and righteous God; and whether ſuch a being, whom we agree to own, ſhould be reverenced and loved, or neglected and diſhonoured? Is it matter of controverſy whether a ſinner ſhould deeply and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly repent of his ſins, or whether he ſhould go on in them? Is it a diſputed point amongſt us whether Jeſus became incarnate, and died upon the croſs for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of ſinners or no? And if it be not, can it be diſputed by them who believe him to be the Son of God, and the Saviour of men, whether a ſinner ſhould ſeek to him or neglect him? or whether one who profeſſes to be a chriſtian ſhould depart from iniquity, or give him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to the practice of it? Are the precepts of our great Maſter written obſcurely in his word, and there ſhould be room ſeriouſly to queſtion whether he require a devout, holy, humble, ſpiritual, watchful, ſelf-deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing life, or whether he allow the contrary? Has Chriſt, after all his pretenſions of bringing life and imortality to light, left it more uncertain than he found it, whether there be any future ſtate of happineſs and miſery, or for whom theſe ſtates are reſpectively intended? Is it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of controverſy whether God will or will not <q>bring every work into judgment, with every ſecret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil Eccl. 12, 14? or whether at the concluſion of that judgment, the wicked ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment, and the righteous into life eternal Matt. 25, 46?</q> You will not, I am ſure, for very ſhame pretend any doubt about thoſe things, and yet call yourſelf a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian. Why then will you not be perſuaded to lay them to heart, and to act as duty and intereſt ſo evidently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire?

Oh ſinner, the cauſe is too obvious; a cauſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed quite unworthy of being called a reaſon. It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou art blinded and beſpotted with thy vanities and thy luſts. It is becauſe thou haſt ſome periſhing trifle, which charms thy imagination and thy ſenſes, ſo that it is dearer to thee than God and Chriſt, than thy own ſoul and its ſalvation. It is, in a word, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou art ſtill under the influence of that carnal mind, which, whatever pious forms it may ſometimes admit and pretend, <q>is enmity againſt God, and is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be Rom. 8, 7.</q> And therefore thou art in the very caſe of thoſe wretches, concerning whom our Lord ſaid, in the days of his fleſh, <q>Ye will not come unto me that ye might have life John 5, 40;</q> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore "ye ſhall die in your ſins John 8, 24."</p>
               <p n="8">§ 8. In this caſe I ſee not what can ſignify to renew thoſe expoſtulations and addreſſes, which I have made in the former chapters. As our bleſſed Redeemer ſays of thoſe who rejected his goſpel, <q>Ye have both ſeen and hated both me and my Father John 15, 24;</q> ſo may I truly ſay with regard to you. I have endeavoured to ſhow you in the plaineſt and cleareſt words, both Chriſt and the Father; I have urged the obligations you are under to both; I have laid before you your guilt, and your condemnation; I have pointed out the only remedy; I have pointed out the Rock on which I have built my own eternal hopes, and the way in which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone I expect ſalvation; I have recommended thoſe things to you, which, if God gives me an opportunity, I will, with my dying breath, earneſtly and affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recommend to my own children, and to all the deareſt friends that I have upon earth who may then be near me; eſteeming it the higheſt token of my friendſhip, the ſureſt proof of my love to them: and if believing the goſpel to be true, you reſolve to reject it, I have nothing farther to ſay, but that you muſt abide by the conſequence—Yet as Moſes, when he went out from the preſence of Pharaoh for the laſt time, finding his heart yet more hardened by all the judgments and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances with which he had formerly been exerciſed, denounced upon him God's paſſing through the land in

It moves my heart at leaſt, if it moves not thine. I firmly believe that every one, who him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf obtains ſalvation and glory, will bear ſo much of his Saviour's image in wiſdom and goodneſs, in zeal for God, and a ſteady regard to the happineſs of the whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, that he will behold this ſad ſcene with calm ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, and without any painful commotion of mind. But as yet I am fleſh and blood; and therefore my bowels are troubled, and mine eyes often overflow with grief, to think that wretched ſinners will have no more compaſſion upon their own ſouls; to think, that in ſpight of all admonition, they will obſtinately run upon final everlaſting deſtruction. It would ſignify nothing to add a prayer here, or a meditation for your uſe. Poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! you will not meditate! you will not pray! Yet, as I have often poured out my heart in prayer over a dying friend, when the force of his diſtemper has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him incapable of joining with me, ſo will I now apply myſelf to God for you, O unhappy creature!

                  </gap> which requires a more immediate attempt of relief.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. It is very poſſible, ſome afflicted creature maybe ready to cry out, It is enough: aggravate my grief and my diſtreſs no more. The ſentence you have been ſo awfully deſcribing, as what ſhall be paſſed and execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the impenitent and unbelieving, is my ſentence; and the terrors of it, are my terrors. For <q>mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities are gone up unto the heavens Rev. 18, 5,</q> and my tranſgreſſions have reached unto the clouds. My caſe is quite ſingular. Surely there never was ſo great a ſinner as I. I have received ſo many mercies, I have enjoyed ſo many advantages, I have heard ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny invitations of goſpel grace; and yet my heart has been ſo hard, and my nature is ſo exceeding ſinful, and the number and aggravating circumſtances of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations have been ſuch, that I dare not hope. It is enough that God hath ſupported me thus long; it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that, after ſo many years of wickedneſs, I am yet out of hell. Every day's reprieve is a mercy at which I am aſtoniſhed. I lie down and wonder, that death and damnation have not ſeized me in my walks the day paſt. I ariſe and wonder that my bed hath not been my grave; wonder, that my ſoul is not ſeparated from fleſh, and ſurrounded with devils and damned ſpirits.</p>

<pb n="109" facs="unknown:021060_0122_0FB20E9F38A05A68"/>
grace are things in which I fear I have no part, and muſt expect none. There are exceeding rich and precious promiſes in the word of God; but they are to me as a ſealed book, and are hid from me as to any perſonal uſe. I know Chriſt is able to ſave; I know he is willing to ſave ſome; but that he ſhould be willing to ſave me, ſuch a poluted, ſuch a provoking creature, as, God knows, and as conſcience knows, I have been, and to this day am; this I know not how to believe; and the utmoſt that I can do towards believing it is to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that it is not abſolutely impoſſible, and that I do not yet lye down in complete deſpair; though, alas! I ſeem upon the very borders of it, and expect every day and hour to fall into it.</p>
               <p n="4">§ 4. I ſhould not, perhaps, have entered ſo fully into this caſe if I had not ſeen many in it; and I will add, reader, for your encouragement, if it be your caſe, ſeveral who are now in the number of the moſt eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, chearful, and uſeful Chriſtians. And I hope divine grace will add you to the reſt, if "out of theſe depths" you be enabled to "cry unto God Pſal. 130, 1;" and though, like Jonah, you may ſeem to be "caſt out from his preſence," yet ſtill, with Jonah, you "look towards his holy temple Jonah 2, 4."</p>
               <p n="5">§ 5. Let it not be imagined that it is in any neglect of that bleſſed Spirit, whoſe office it is to be the great Comforter, that I now attempt to reaſon you out of this diſconſolate frame; for it is as the great ſource of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that he deals with rational creatures, and it is in the uſe of rational means and conſiderations that he may moſt juſtly be expected to operate. Give me leave, therefore to addreſs myſelf calmly to you, and to aſk you what reaſon you have for all theſe paſſionate complaints and accuſations againſt yourſelf? what reaſon have you to ſuggeſt that your caſe is ſingular, when ſo many have told you they have felt the ſame? what reaſon have you to conclude ſo hardly againſt yourſelf, when the goſpel ſpeaks in ſuch favourable terms? or what reaſon to imagine that the gracious things it ſays are not intended for you? You know indeed more of the corruptions of your own heart than you know of the hearts of others; and you make a thouſand charitable excuſes for their
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:021060_0123_0FB20EA0A35453A8"/>
viſible failings and infirmities which you make not for your own; and it may be ſome of thoſe, whom you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire as eminent ſaints when compared with you, are, on their part, humbling themſelves in the duſt as unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be numbered among the leaſt of God's people, and wiſhing themſelves like you, in whom they think they ſee much more good, and much leſs of evil than in themſelves.</p>
               <p n="6">§ 6. But to ſuppoſe the worſt? what if they were really the vileſt ſinner that ever lived upon the face of the earth? what <q>if your iniquities had gone up unto the heavens Rev. 18, 5.</q> every day, and your tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions had reached unto the clouds, reached thither with ſuch horrid aggravations, that earth and heaven ſhould have had reaſon to deteſt you as a monſter of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety? Admitting all this, <q>is any thing too hard for the Lord Gen. 18, 14?</q> are any ſins of which a ſinner can repent of ſo deep a dye that the blood of Chriſt cannot waſh them away? Nay though it would be daring wickedneſs and monſtrous folly for any "to ſin that grace might abound Rom. 6, 1," yet had you indeed raiſed your account beyond all that divine grace has ever yet pardoned, who ſhould <q>limit the holy One of Iſrael Pſal. 78, 41?</q> or who ſhould pretend to ſay that it was impoſſible that God might, for your very wretchedneſs chuſe you out from others, to make you a monument of mercy, and a trophy of hitherto unparalleled grace? The Apoſtle Paul ſtrongly intimates this to have been the caſe with regard to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and why might not you likewiſe, if indeed <q>the chief of ſinners obtain mercy, that in you, as the Chief, Jeſus Chriſt might ſhow forth all long ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for a pattern to them who ſhall hereafter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve 1 Tim. 1, 15.16?</q>
               </p>
               <p n="7">§ 7. Gloomy as your apprehenſions are, I would aſk you plainly, Do you in your conſcience think that Chriſt is not able to ſave you? What, is he not <q>able to ſave, even to the uttermoſt, them that come unto God by him Heb. 7, 25.</q> Yes you will ſay, abundantly able to do it; but I dare not imagine that he will do it. And how do you know that he will not? He has helped the very greateſt ſinners of all, that have yet applied

But dear reader, let me intreat you to look into the text itſelf, and ſee whether that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation be expreſsly added there. Do you there read, <q>None of them whom the Father hath given me ſhall he caſt out?</q> The words are in a much more encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging form: and why ſhould you fruſtrate his wiſdom and goodneſs by ſuch an addition of your own? <q>add not to his words, leſt he reprove thee Prov. 30, 6:</q> take them as they ſtand, and drink in the conſolation of them. Our Lord knew into what perplexity ſome ſerious minds might poſſibly be thrown by what he had before been ſaying, "All that the Father hath given me ſhall come unto me;" and therefore as it were on purpoſe to balance it, he adds thoſe gracious words, <q>Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wife,</q> by no means on no conſideration whatever, "caſt out."</p>
               <p n="8">§ 8. If therefore you are already diſcouraged and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified at the greatneſs of your ſins, do not add to their weight and number that one greater and worſe than all the reſt, a diſtruſt of the faithfulneſs and grace of the bleſſed Redeemer. Do not, ſo far as in you lies, oppoſe all the purpoſes of his love to you. O diſtreſſed ſoul, whom doſt thou dread? to whom doſt thou tremble to approach?

great danger there is of ſelf-flattery on this important head; and how neceſſary is it to caution men againſt too haſty a concluſion that they are really converted, becauſe they have felt ſome warm emotion on their minds, and have reformed the groſs irregularities of their former conduct. A miſtake here might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely fatal; it may prove the occaſion of that falſe peace, which ſhall lead a man to bleſs himſelf in his own heart, and to conclude himſelf ſecure, while all the threatenings and curſes of God's law are ſounding in his ears, and lye indeed directly againſt him Deut. 29, 19.20; while, in the mean time he applies to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a thouſand promiſes, in which he has no ſhare; which may prove therefore, like generous wine to a man in an high fever, or ſtrong opiates to one in a lethargy. The ſtony ground received the word with joy, and a promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing harveſt ſeemed to be ſpringing up; yet it ſoon wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered away Matth. 13, 5.6, and no reaper filled his arms with it. Now, that this may not be the caſe with you, that all my labours and yours hitherto may not be loſt, and that a vain dream of ſecurity and happineſs may not plunge you deeper in miſery and ruin, give me leave to lead you into a ſerious inquiry into your own heart; that ſo you may be better able to judge of your caſe, and to diſtinguiſh between what is at moſt being only near the kingdom of heaven, and becoming indeed a member of it.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. Now this depends upon the ſincerity of your faith in Chriſt, when faith is taken in its largeſt extent, as explained above; that is as comprehending repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and that ſteady purpoſe of new and univerſal obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of which, wherever it is real, faith will aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be the vital principle. Therefore to aſſiſt you in judging of your ſtate, give me leave to aſk you, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to intreat you to aſk yourſelf, What views you have had, and now have of ſin, and of Chriſt? and what your future purpoſes are with regard to your conduct in the remainder of life that may lye before you? I ſhall not reaſon largely upon the ſeveral particulars I ſuggeſt under theſe heads, but rather refer you to your own reading and obſervation, to judge how agreeable they are to the word of God, the great rule by which
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:021060_0129_0FB20EABF12F85B0"/>
our characters muſt quickly be tried, and our eternal ſtate unalterably determined.</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. Inquire ſeriouſly, in the firſt place, what views you have had of ſin, and, what ſentiments you have felt in your ſoul with regard to it. There was a time when it wore a flattering aſpect, and made a fair in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting appearance, ſo that all your heart was charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, and it was the very buſineſs of your life to practiſe it. But you have ſince been undeceived: you have felt it <q>bite like a ſerpent, and ſting like an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Prov. 23, 32:</q> you have beheld it with an abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence far greater than the delight which it ever gave you. So far it is well. It is thus with every true penitent, and with ſome I fear who are not of that number. Let me, therefore inquire farther, whence aroſe this abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence? Was it merely from a principle of ſelf love? was it merely becauſe you had been wounded by it; was it merely becauſe you had thereby brought condemnation and ruin upon your own ſoul? Was there no ſenſe of its deformity, of its baſeneſs, of its malignity, as committed againſt the bleſſed God, conſidered as a glorious, a bountiful, and a merciful being? Were you never pierc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an apprehenſion of its vile ingratitude? And as for thoſe purpoſes which have ariſen in your heart a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, let me beſeech you to reflect how they have been formed, and how they have hitherto been executed. Have they been univerſal? have they been reſolute? and yet, amidſt all that reſolution, have they been humble? When you declared war with ſin, was it with every ſin? and is it an irreconcileable war which you determine by divine grace to puſh on, till you have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely conquered it, or die in the attempt? And are you accordingly active in your endeavours to ſubdue and deſtroy it? If ſo, what are <q>the fruits worthy or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance which you bring forth Luke 3, 8?</q> It does not, I hope, all flow away in floods of grief: have you <q>ceaſed to do evil? are you learning to do well Iſa. 1, 16.17?</q> Doth your reformation ſhow that you repent of your ſins; or do your renewed relapſes into ſin prove that you repent even of what you call your repentance? Have you an inward abhorrence of all ſin, and an unſeigned zeal againſt it? And doth that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:021060_0130_0FB20EAE1F143128"/>
a care to guard againſt the occaſions of it, and temptation, to it! Do you watch againſt the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that have enſnared you? and do you particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly double your guard againſt <q>that ſin which does moſt eaſily beſet you Heb. 12, 1:</q> Is that laid aſide, that the Chriſtian race may be run: laid aſide with a firm determination that you will return to it no more, that you will hold no more parley with it, that you will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver take another ſtep towards it?</p>
               <p n="4">§ 4. Permit me alſo further to inquire, what your views of Chriſt have been? what you think of him, and of your concern with him? have you been fully convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that there muſt be a correſpondence ſettled between him and your ſoul; and do you ſee and feel, that you are not only to pay him a kind of diſtant homage, and tranſient compliment, as a very wiſe, benevolent, and excellent perſon, whoſe name and memory, you have a reverence for; but that, as he lives and reigns, as he is ever near you, and always obſerving you, ſo you muſt look to him, muſt approach him, muſt humbly tranſact buſineſs with him, and that, buſineſs of the higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, on which your ſalvation depends?</p>
               <p n="5">§ 5. You have been brought to inquire, <q>Wherewith ſhall I come before the Lord, and bow myſelf before the moſt high God Micah. 6, 6?</q> And once perhaps, you are thinking of ſacrifices, which your own ſtores might have been ſufficient to furniſh out. Are you now convinced they will not ſuffice; and that you muſt have recourſe to the Lamb which God hath provided? Have you had a view of Jeſus, as <q>taking away the ſin of the world John 1, 29? as made a ſin-offering for us, though he knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him 2 Cor. 5, 21?</q> Have you viewed him as perfectly righteous in himſelf; and deſpairing of being juſtified by any righteouſneſs of your own, have you "ſubmitted to the righteouſneſs of God Rom. 10, 3?" Has your heart ever been brought to a deep conviction of this important truth, that if ever your are ſaved at all, it muſt be through Chriſt; that if ever God extend mercy to you at all, it muſt be for his ſake; that if ever you are fixed in the temple of God above, you muſt ſtand there as an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting

Have you heartily conſented to this? and do you, on this account of the matter, renew your conſent? do you renew it deliberately and determinately, and feel your whole ſoul, as it were, ſaying, <hi>Amen,</hi> while you read this? If this be the caſe, then I can with great pleaſure give you (as it were) the right hand of fellowſhip, and ſalute and embrace you as a ſincere diſciple of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as one who is <q>delivered from the power of darkneſs, and is tranſlated into the kingdom of the Son of God Col. 1, 13.</q> I can then ſalute you in the Lord, as one to whom, as a miniſter of Jeſus, I am commiſſioned and charged to ſpeak comfortably, and to tell you, not that I abſolve you from your ſins, for it is a ſmall matter to be judged of man's judgment, but that the bleſſed God himſelf abſolveth you; that you are one to whom he hath ſaid in his goſpel, and is continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

Know in the general, that if you are <q>a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian indeed, you have been renewed in the ſpirit of your minds Eph. 4, 23;</q> ſo renewed as to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate, "and born again." It is not enough to have aſſumed a new name, to have been brought under ſome new reſtraints, or to have made a partial change in ſome particulars of your conduct. The change muſt be great and univerſal. Inquire, then, whether you have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained new apprehenſions of things, have formed a practical judgment different from what you formerly did: whether the ends you purpoſe, the affections, which you feel working in your heart, and the courſe of action to which, by thoſe affections, you are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, be on the whole new or old<note n="*" place="bottom">The reader may ſee theſe thoughts illuſtrated at large in the three firſt of my ſermons on Regeneration.</note>?—Again, If you are a Chriſtian indeed, you are <q>partaker of a divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture 2 Pet. 1, 4,</q> divine in its original, its tendency, and its reſemblance. Inquire therefore whether God hath implanted a principle in your heart which tends to him, and which makes you like him. Search your ſoul attentively, to ſee if you have really the image there of God's moral perfections, of his holineſs and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, his goodneſs and fidelity; for <q>the new man is after God created in righteouſneſs and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs Eph. 4, 24," and "is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him Col. 3, 10.</q>

               <p n="4">§ 4. For your farther aſſiſtance, inquire whether <q>the ſame mind be in you which was alſo in Chriſt Phil 2, 5,</q> whether you bear the image of God's incarnate Son, the brighteſt and the faireſt reſemblance of the Father, which earth or heaven has ever beheld? The bleſſed Jeſus deſigned himſelf to be a model for all his followers; and he is certainly a model moſt fit for our imitation; an example in our nature, and in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances adapted to general uſe; an example recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to us at once by its ſpotleſs perfection, and by the endearing relation in which he ſtands to us, as our Maſter, our friend, and our head, as the perſon by whom our everlaſting ſtate is to be fixed, and in a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to whom our final happineſs is to conſiſt,

Any thing of his humility, meekneſs, and benevolence to men? Any thing of his purity and wiſdom, his contempt of the world, his patience, his fortitude his zeal? And indeed, all the other branches of the Chriſtian temper, which do not imply previous guilt in the perſon, by whom they are exerciſed, may be called in to illuſtrate and aſſiſt your inquiries under this head.</p>
               <p n="5">§ 5. Let me add, If you are a Chriſtian, you are in the main "ſpiritually minded, as knowing that is life <q>and peace; whereas to be carnally minded is death Rom. 8, 6. Though you live in the fleſh, you will not war after it 2 Cor. 10, 3;</q> you will not take your orders and your commands from it. You will indeed attend to its neceſſary intereſts as matter of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but it will ſtill be with regard to another and a nobler intereſt, that of the rational and immortal ſpirit. Your thoughts, your affections, your purſuits, your choice, will be determined by a regard to things ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual rather than carnal.—In a word, <q>you will walk by faith, and not by ſight 2 Cor 5, 7.</q> Future, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible, and, in ſome degree, incomprehenſible objects, will take up your mind. Your faith will act on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God, his perfections, his providences, his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, his threatenings, and his promiſes. It will act upon Chriſt, "whom having not ſeen, you will love," and honour 1 Pet. 1, 8.

Examine then, I entreat you <q>the temper of your heart, with regard to the bleſſed God.</q> Do you find there a reverential fear, and a ſupreme love and veneration for his incomparable excellencies, a deſire after him as the higheſt good, and a cordial gratitude towards him as your ſupreme benefactor? Can you truſt his care? Can you credit his teſtimony? Do you deſire to pay an unreſerved obedience to all that he commands, and an humble ſubmiſſion to all the diſpoſals of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence? Do you deſign his glory as your nobleſt end, and make it the great buſineſs of your life to approve yourſelf to him?

Faith in Chriſt I have already deſcribed at large; and therefore ſhall ſay nothing farther, either of that perſuaſion of his power and grace, which is the great foundation of it; or of that acceptance of Chriſt under all his characters or that ſurrender of the ſoul into his hands, in which its peculiar and diſtinguiſhing nature conſiſts.</p>
               <p n="9">§ 9. If this faith in Chriſt be ſincere, <q>it will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly produce a love to him;</q> which will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs itſelf in affectionate thoughts of him; in ſtrict fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to him; in a careful obſervation of his charge; in a regard to his Spirit, to his friends, and to his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts; in a reverence to the memorials of his dying love, which he has inſtituted; and in an ardent deſire after that heavenly world where he dwells, and where he will at length <q>have all his people to dwell with him John 17, 24</q>
               </p>
               <p n="10">§ 10.

It will be matter of joy to you that ſuch a Redeemer has appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this world of ours; and your joy for yourſelves will be proportionable to the degree of clearneſs with

which you diſcern your intereſt in him, and relation to him.</p>
               <p n="11">§ 11. Let me farther lead you into ſome reflections on the temper of your heart towards the bleſſed Spirit. If we <q>have not the Spirit, of Chriſt, we are none of his Rom. 8, 9. If we are not led by the Spirit of God, we are not the children of God Rom. 8, 14.</q> You will then, if you are a real Chriſtian, deſire that you may "be filled with the Spirit Eph. 5, 18;" that you may have every power of your ſoul ſubject to his authority; that his agency on your heart may be more conſtant, more operative, and more delightful. And to cheriſh theſe ſacred influences, you will often have recourſe to ſerious conſideration and meditation: you will abſtain from thoſe ſins which tend to grieve him: you will improve the tender ſeaſons in which he ſeems to breathe upon your ſoul; you will ſtrive earneſtly with God in prayer, that you may have him <q>ſhed on you ſtill more abundantly through Jeſus Chriſt Tit. 3, 6:</q> and you will be deſirous to fall in with the great end of his miſſion, which was to <q>glorify Chriſt John 16, 14,</q> and to eſtabliſh his kingdom. You will deſire his influence, as the Spirit of adoption, to render your acts of worſhip free and affectionate; your ſorrow for ſin overflowing and tender; your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation meek, and your love ardent: in a word, to carry you through life and death with the temper of a child who delights in his father, and who longs for his more immediate preſence.</p>
               <p n="12">§ 12. Once more. If you are a Chriſtian indeed, you will be deſirous to obtain the ſpirit of courage. Amidſt all that humility of ſoul to which you will be formed, you will wiſh to commence a hero in the cauſe of Chriſt, oppoſing with a vigorous reſolution, the ſtrongeſt efforts of the power of darkneſs, the inward corruption of your own heart, and all the outward dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties you may meet with in the way of your duty, while in the cauſe and in the ſtrength of Chriſt you go on "conquering and to conquer."</p>

               </p>
               <p n="14">§ 14. Let me now farther lay before you ſome branches of the Chriſtian temper, which relate more immediately to ourſelves. And here, if you are a Chriſtian indeed, you will undoubtedly "prefer the ſoul to the <q>body, and things eternal to thoſe things that are temporal.</q> Conſcious of the dignity and value of your immortal part, you will come to a firm reſolution to ſecure its happineſs, whatever is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, whatever is to be endured in that view. If you are a real Chriſtian, you will be alſo <q>clothed with humility 1 Pet. 5, 5.</q> You will have a deep ſenſe of your own imperfections, both natural and moral; of the ſhort extent of our knowledge, of the uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and weakneſs of your reſolutions, and of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual dependence upon God, and upon almoſt every thing about you. And eſpecially, you will be deeply ſenſible of your guilt; the remembrance of which will fill you with ſhame and confuſion, even when you have ſome reaſon to hope it is forgiven. This will forbid all haughtineſs and inſolence in your behaviour to your fellow creatures. It will teach you under afflictive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences, with all holy ſubmiſſion, to <q>bear the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of the Lord," as thoſe that know they have ſinned againſt him Micah 7, 9.</q>—Again, if you are a Chriſtian indeed, you will labour after <q>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of ſoul,</q> and maintain a fixed abhorrence of all prohibited ſenſual indulgence. A recollection of paſt impurities will fill you with ſhame and grief; and you will endeavour for the future to guard your thoughts and deſires, as well as your words and actions, and to abſtain not only from the commiſſion of evil, but from the diſtant appearance and probable occaſions of it 1 Theſ. 5, 22; as conſcious of the perfect holineſs of that God with whom you converſe, and of the purifying nature of that hope 1 John 3, 3, which, by has goſpel, he hath taught you to entertain.</p>
               <p n="15">§ 15. With this is nearly allied that <q>amiable vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of temperance,</q> which will teach you to guard againſt ſuch a uſe of meats and drinks as indiſpoſes the body for the ſervice of the ſoul; or ſuch an indulgence
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:021060_0141_0FB20EC79283AB78"/>
in either, as will rob you of that precious jewel, your time, or occaſion an expence beyond what your circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will admit, and beyond what will conſiſt with thoſe liberalities to the poor, which your relation and theirs to God and each other will require. In ſhort, you will guard againſt whatever has a tendency to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe a ſenſual diſpoſition; againſt whatever would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienate the ſoul from communion with God, and would diminiſh its zeal and activity in his ſervice.</p>
               <p n="16">§ 16. The divine philoſophy of the bleſſed JESUS will alſo teach you "a contented temper." It will mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate your deſires of thoſe wordly enjoyments, after which many feel ſuch an inſatiable thirſt, ever growing with indulgence and ſucceſs. You will guard againſt an immoderate care about thoſe things which would lead you into a forgetfulneſs of your heavenly inheritance. If Providence diſappoint your undertaking, you will ſubmit. If others be more proſperous, you will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy them; but rather will be thankful for what God is pleaſed to beſtow upon them, as well as for what he gives you. No unlawful methods will be uſed to alter your preſent condition; and whatever it is, you will endeavour to make the beſt of it; remembering it is what infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs have appointed you, and that it is beyond all compariſon better than you have deſerved; yea, that the very deficiencies and inconveniencies of it may conduce to the improvement of your future and complete happineſs.</p>
               <p n="17">§ 17. With contentment, if you are a diſciple of Chriſt, <q>you will join patience too, and in patience will poſſeſs your ſoul Luke 21, 19.</q> You cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed be quite inſenſible either of afflictions or of inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; but your mind will be calm and compoſed under them, and ſteady in the proſecution of proper duty, though afflictions preſs, ond though your hopes, your deareſt hopes and proſpects be delayed. Patience will prevent haſty and raſh concluſions, and fortify you againſt ſeeking irregular methods of relief; diſpoſing you, in the mean time, till God ſhall be pleaſed to appear for you, to go on ſteadily in the way of your duty; <q>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting yourſelf to him in well-doing 1 Pet. 4, 19.</q> You will alſo be careful, that <q>patience may have

its perfect work James 1, 4,</q> and prevail in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to thoſe circumſtances which demand its pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar exerciſe. For inſtance, When the ſucceſſions of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil are long and various, ſo that deep calls to deep, and all God's waves and billows ſeem to be going over you one after another Pſ. 42, 7; when God touches you in the moſt tender part; when the reaſons of his conduct to you are quite unaccountable; when your natural ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are weak and decayed, when unlawful methods of redreſs ſeem near and eaſy; ſtill your reverence for the will of your heavenly Father will carry it againſt all, and keep you waiting quietly for deliverance in his own time and way.</p>

I have thus led you into a brief review of the Chriſtian temper, with reſpect to God and ourſelves: permit me now to add, That the goſpel will teach you another ſet of very important leſſons with reſpect to your fellow-creatures.

The religion of the bleſſed Jeſus, when it triumphs in your ſoul, will conquer the predominancy of an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſelf-love, and will teach you candidly and tenderly to look upon your neighbour as another ſelf. As you are ſenſible of your own rights, you will be ſenſible of his; as you ſupport your own character, you will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his.

with all that in <q>every place call on the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt 1 Cor. 1, 2;</q> whom, if you truly love, you will alſo love all thoſe whom you have reaſon to believe to be his diſciples and ſervants.</p>
               <p n="21">§ 21. If you be yourſelves indeed of that number, "you will alſo "put on bowels of mercy Col. 3, 12." The mercies of God, and thoſe of the bleſſed Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, will work on your heart, to mould it to ſentiments of compaſſion and generoſity, ſo that you will feel the wants and ſorrows of others; you will deſire to relieve their neceſſities, and, as you have opportunity, you will do good both to their bodies and their ſouls; expreſſing your kind affections and ſuitable actions, which may both evidence their ſincerity, and render them effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</p>
               <p n="22">§ 22. As a Chriſtian, you will alſo maintain truth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable, not only in your ſolemn teſtimonies, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by an oath, but likewiſe in common converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You will remember, too, that your promiſes bring an obligation upon you, which you are by no means at liberty to break through. On the whole, you will be careful to keep a ſtrict correſpondence between your words and your actions, in ſuch a manner as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a ſervant of the God of truth.</p>

There is a moderation contrary to all theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, which the goſpel recommends; and if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the goſpel in good earneſt into your heart, it will lay the ax to the root of ſuch evils as theſe.</p>
               <p n="24">§ 24. Having thus briefly illuſtrated the principle branches of the Chriſtian temper and character, I ſhall conclude the repreſentation with reminding you of ſome general qualifications, which muſt be mingled with all, and give a tincture to each of them; ſuch as ſincerity, conſtancy, tenderneſs, zeal and prudence.</p>
               <p n="25">§ 25. Always remember, <q>that ſincerity is the very ſoul of true religion.</q> A ſingle intention to pleaſe God, and to approve ourſelves to him muſt animate and govern all that we do in it. Under the influence of this principle you will impartially inquire into every intimation of duty, and apply to the practice of it ſo far as it is known to you. Your heart will be engaged in all you do. Your conduct in private and in ſecret will be agreeable to your moſt public behaviour. A ſenſe of the divine authority will teach you to <q>eſteem all God's precepts concerning all things to be right, and to hate every falſe way Pſal. 119, 128.</q>

And thus you are to go on to the end of your life, not diſcouraged by the length and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of the way, nor allured on the one hand, or teri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fied on the other, by all the various temptations which may ſurround and aſſault you. Your ſoul muſt be fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on this baſis, and you are ſtill to behave yourſelf as

one who knows he ſerves an unchangeable God, and who expects from him a kingdom which cannot be moved Heb. 12, 28.</p>
               <p n="27">§ 27. Again, ſo far as the goſpel prevails in your heart, <q>your ſpirit will be tender, and the ſtone will be transformed into fleſh.</q> You will deſire that your apprehenſion of divine things may be quick, your affections ready to take proper impreſſions, your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence always eaſily touched, and, on the whole, your reſolutions pliant to the divine authority, and cordially willing to be, and to do, whatever God ſhall appoint. You will have a tender regard to the word of God, a tender caution againſt ſin, a tender guard againſt the ſnares of proſperity, a tender ſubmiſſion to God's afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand: in a word, you will be tender wherever the divine honour is concerned; and careful neither to do any thing yourſelf, nor to allow any thing in another, ſo far as you can influence, by which God ſhould be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, or religion reproached.</p>
               <p n="28">§ 28. Nay, more than all this, you will, ſo far as true Chriſtianity governs in your mind, <q>exert an holy zeal in the ſervice of your Redeemer and your Father.</q> You will be zealouſly affected in every good thing Gal. 4, 18. in proportion to its apprehended goodneſs and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance.

Nor will you be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to look with an indifferent eye on the conduct of others in this view; but, ſo far as charity, meekneſs, and prudence will admit, you will teſtify your diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of every thing in it which is diſhonourable to God and injurious to men.

You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, I am perſuaded, be ſo little acquainted with Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity as not to know, that the doctrine of divine aſſiſtances bears a very conſiderable part in it. You have often, I doubt not, read of <q>the law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus, as making us free from the law of ſin and death Rom. 8, 2;</q> and have been told that <q>through the Spirit we mortify the deeds of the body Rom. 8, 13: you have read of doing all things through Chriſt who ſtrengthened us Phil. 4, 13; whoſe grace is ſufficient for us, and whoſe ſtrength is made perfect through weakneſs 2 Cor. 12, 9:</q> permit me, therefore, now to call down your attention to this, as a truth of the cleareſt evidence, and the utmoſt importance.</p>

               <p n="4">§ 4. Accordingly, if you give yourſelf leave to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult Scripture on this head, (and if you would live like a Chriſtian, you muſt be conſulting it every day, and forming your notions and actions by it,) you will ſee, that the whole tenor of it teaches that dependence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God which I am now recommending. You will particularly ſee, that the production of religion in the ſoul is matter of divine promiſe; that when it has been effected, Scripture aſcribes it to a divine agency, and that the increaſe of grace and piety in the heart of thoſe who are truly regenerate, is alſo ſpoken of as the work of God, who begins and carrys it on until the day of Jeſus Chriſt Phil. 1, 6.</p>
               <p n="5">§ 5. In conſequence of all theſe views, lay it down to yourſelf as a moſt certain principle, that no attempt in religion is to be made in your own ſtrength. If you forget this, and God purpoſes finally to ſave you, he will humble you by repeated diſappointments, till he teach you better. You will be aſhamed of one ſcheme and effort, and of another, till you ſettle upon the true baſis. He will alſo probably ſhow you, not only in the general that your ſtrength is to be derived from heaven; but particularly, that it is the office of the bleſſed Spirit to purify the heart, and to invigorate holy reſolutions; and alſo, that in all theſe operations he is to be conſidered as the Spirit of Chriſt, working under his directions, and as a vital communication from him, under the character of the great head of the church, the grand Treaſurer and Diſpenſer of theſe holy and beneficial influences. On which account it is called the <q>ſupply of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt Phil. 1, 19, who is exalted at the right hand of the Father, to give repentance and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins Acts 5, 31: in whoſe grace alone we can be ſtrong 2 Tim. 2, 17, and of whoſe fulneſs we receive, even grace for grace John 1, 16.</q>

WITH the utmoſt propriety has our divine Maſter required us to <q>ſtrive to enter in at the ſtrait gate Luke 13, 24;</q> thereby (as it ſeems) intimating, not only that the paſſage is narrow, but that it is beſet with enemies; beſet on the right hand and on the left with enemies cunning and formidable. And be aſſured, O reader, that whatever your circumſtances
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:021060_0158_0FB20EE9B6E3F8B0"/>
in life are, you muſt meet and encounter them. It will, therefore, be your prudence to ſurvey them attentively in your own reflections, that you may ſee what you are to expect; and may conſider in what armour it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary you ſhould be clothed, and with what weapons you muſt be furniſhed to manage the combat. You have often heard them marſhalled as it were, under three great leaders, the fleſh, the world, and the devil; and according to this diſtribution, I would call you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the forces of each, as ſetting themſelves in array againſt you. O that you may be excited to <q>take to yourſelf the whole armour of God, and to quit your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf like a man 1 Cor. 16, 13.</q> and a Chriſtian!</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. Let your conſcience anſwer whether you do not carry about with you a corrupt and a degenerate nature? You will, I doubt not, feel its effects. You will feel, in the language of the Apoſtle, (who ſpeaks of it as the caſe of Chriſtians themſelves,) <q>the fleſh luſting againſt the ſpirit, ſo that you will not be able,</q> in all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances "to do the things that you would Gal. 5, 17."

You will, no doubt, often recollect the ſtrong figures in which the prophet deſcribes a caſe like yours; and you will own that it is juſtly repreſented by that <q>of an Ethiopian changing his ſkin, and the leopard his ſpots Jer. 13, 23.</q> It is indeed poſſible that at firſt you may find ſuch an edge and eagerneſs upon your own ſpirits, as may lead you to imagine, that all oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition will immediately fall before you; but alas!

The things of the world will hinder you one way; and the men of the world another. Perhaps you may meet with much leſs aſſiſtance in religion than you are now ready to expect from good men. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent generation of them is generally ſo cautious to avoid every thing that looks like oſtentation, and there ſeems ſomething ſo inſupportably dreadful in the chage of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, that you will find moſt of your Chriſtian breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren ſtudying to conceal their virtue and their piety much more than others ſtudy to conceal their vices and their profaneneſs. But while, unleſs your ſituation be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly happy, you meet with very little aid one way, you will, no doubt, find great oppoſition another. The enemies of religion will be bold and active in their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, while many of its friends ſeem unconcerned: and one ſinner will probably exert himſelf more to corrupt you than ten Chriſtians to ſecure and ſave you. They who have once been your companions in ſin will try a thouſand artful methods to allure you back again to their forſaken ſociety: ſome of them perhaps with an appearance of tender fondneſs; and many more by the almoſt irriſiſtible art of banter and ridicule; that boaſted teſt of right and wrong, as it has been wantonly called, will be tried upon you, perhaps without any regard to decency, or even to common humanity. You will be derided and inſulted by thoſe whoſe eſteem and affection you naturally deſire: and may find much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety than you imagine in the expreſſion of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, "The trial of cruel mockings Heb. 11, 36," which ſome fear more than either ſword or flames.

               <p n="4">§ 4. And it is not at all improbable, that, in the mean time, Satan may be doing his utmoſt to diſcourage and diſtreſs you. He will, no doubt, raiſe in your imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the moſt tempting idea of the gratifications, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgencies, and the companions, you are obliged to forſake; and give you the moſt diſcouraging and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying view of the difficulties, ſeverities and dangers, which are (as he will perſuade you) inſeperable from religion. He will not fail to repreſent God himſelf, the fountain of goodneſs and happineſs, an hard maſter, whom it is impoſſible to pleaſe. He will perhaps fill you with the moſt diſtreſsful fears, and with cruel and inſolent malice glory over you as his ſlave, when he knows you are the Lord's free-man. At one time he will ſtudy, by his vile ſuggeſtions, to interrupt you in your duties, as if they gave him an additional power over you: at another time he will endeavour to weary you of your devotion, by influencing you to prolong it to an immoderate and tedious length, leſt his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhould be exerted upon you when it ceaſes. In ſhort, this practiſed deceiver has artifices, which it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whole volumes to diſplay, with particular cautions againſt each.

Such ſolemnity in the manner of doing it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly very reaſonable in the nature of things; and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is highly expedient, for binding to the Lord ſuch a treacherous heart, as we know our own to be. It will be pleaſant to reflect upon it, as done at ſuch and ſuch a time, with ſuch and ſuch circumſtances of place and method, which may ſerve to ſtrike the memory and the conſcience. The ſenſe of the vows of God which are upon you will ſtrengthen you in an hour of temptation; and the recollection may alſo encourage your humble boldneſs and freedom in applying to him, under the character and relation of <q>your covenant God and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</q> as future exigencies may require.</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">§ 1. I HOPE this chapter will find you, by a moſt expreſs conſent, become one of God's covenant-people, ſolemnly and cordially devoted to his ſervice; and it is my hearty prayer, that the covenant you have
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:021060_0174_0FB20F0AD509E8F8"/>
made on earth may be ratified in heaven. But for your farther inſtruction and edification, give me leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind you, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath appointed a peculiar manner of expreſſing our regard to him, and of ſolemnly renewing his covenant with him, which, though it does not forbid any other proper way of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, muſt by no means be ſet aſide or neglected for any human methods, how prudent and expedient ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may appear to us.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. Our Lord has wiſely ordained, that the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of ſociety ſhould be brought into religion; and as, by his command, profeſſing Chriſtians aſſemble together for other acts of public worſhip, ſo he has been pleaſed to inſtitute a ſocial ordinance, in which a whole aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of them is to come to his table, and there to eat the ſame bread, and drink the ſame cup. And this they are to do as a token of their affectionate remembrance of his dying love, of their ſolemn ſurrender of themſelves to God, and of their ſincere love to another, and to all their fellow Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. That theſe are indeed the great ends of the Lord's ſupper, I ſhall not now ſtay to argue at large.— You need only read what the Apoſtle St. Paul has writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the tenth and eleventh chapters of his firſt Epiſtle to the Corinthians, to convince you fully of this. He there expreſsly tells us, that our Lord commanded the bread to be eaten, and the wine to be drank in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him 1 Cor. 11, 24.25. or as a commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or memorial of him: ſo that, as often as we at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend this inſtitution, we ſhew forth our Lord's death, which we are to do even until he come again Ver. 26. And it is particularly aſſerted, That the cup is the new Teſtament in his blood Ver. 25; that is, it is a ſeal of that covenant which was ratified by his blood. Now, it is evident that, in conſequence of this, we are to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach it with a view to that covenant, deſiring its bleſſings, and reſolving by divine grace to comply with its demands. On the whole, therefore, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, we have communion in the body and the blood of Chriſt Cor. 10, 16; and partaking of his table, and of his cup, we converſe with Chriſt, and join ourſelves to him as his people: as the Heathens had, in their i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatrous
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:021060_0175_0FB20F0BD7DD4890"/>
rites, communion with their deities, and joined themſelves to them; and the Jews by eating their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, converſed with Jehovah, and joined themſelves to him. He farther reminds them, that though many, they were "one bread and one body, being all partakers of that one bread 1 Cor. 10, 17." and being <q>all made to drink into one ſpirit 1 Cor. 12, 13;</q> that is, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together as if they were but one family, and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the commemoration of that one blood which was their common ranſom, and of the Lord Jeſus their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon head. Now, it is evident, all theſe reaſonings are applicable to Chriſtians in ſucceeding ages. Permit me, therefore, by the authority of our divine Maſter, to preſs upon you the obſervation of this precept.</p>
               <p n="4">§ 4. And let me alſo urge it, from the apparent ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency which it has to promote your trueſt advantage. You are ſetting out in the Chriſtian life; and I have reminded you at large of the oppoſition you muſt expect to meet with in it. It is the love of Chriſt which muſt animate you to break through all. What then can be more deſirable than to bear about with you a lively ſenſe of it? and what can awaken that ſenſe more than the contemplation of death as there repreſented! Who can behold the bread broken, and the wine poured out, and not reflect how the body of the bleſſed Jeſus was even torn in pieces by his ſufferings, and his ſacred blood pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red forth like water on the ground? Who can think of the heart-rending agonies of the Son of God, as the price of our redemption and ſalvation, and not feel his ſoul melted with tenderneſs, and inflamed with grateful affection? What an exalted view doth it give us of the bleſſings of the goſpel-covenant, when we conſider it as "eſtabliſhed in the blood of God's only begotten Son?" and when we make our approach to God, as our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, and give up ourſelves to his ſervice in this ſolemn manner, what an awful tendency has it to fix the conviction, that <q>we are not our own, being bought with ſuch a price 1 Cor. 6, 19.20?</q> What a tendency has it to guard us againſt every temptation to thoſe ſins which we have ſo ſolemnly renounced, and to engage our fidelity to him to whom we have <q>bound our ſoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Well may theſe views engage us to "deny ourſelves, and to "take up our croſs and follow our crucified Maſter Matt 26, 24:" well may they engage us to do our utmoſt by prayer, and all other ſuitable endeavours, to ſerve his followers and his friends; to ſerve thoſe who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The great queſtion is that which relates to your being prepared for a worthy attendance: and, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with what hath been ſaid before, I think that may be brought to a very ſhort iſſue. Have you, ſo far a you know your own heart, been ſincere in that deliberate ſurrender of yourſelf to God through Chriſt, which I recommend in the former chapter? If you have, (whether it were with or without the particular form or manner of doing it there recommended,) you have certainly taken hold of the covenant, and therefore have a right to the ſeal of it. And there is not, and cannot be, any other view of the ordinance in which you can have any farther objection to it. If you deſire to remember Chriſt's death, if you deſire to renew the dedication of yourſelf to God through him, if you would liſt yourſelf among his people, if you would love them, and do them good according to your ability; and, on the whole, would not allow yourſelf in the practice of any one known ſin, or in the omiſſion of any one known duty, then I will venture confidently to ſay, not only that you will be welcome to the ordinance, but that it was inſtituted for ſuch as you.</p>
               <p n="7">§ 7. As for other objections, a few words may ſuffice, by way of reply.

injured. And as for the fears of aggravated guilt in caſe of apoſtaſy, do not indulge them. This may, by the divine bleſſing, be an effectual remedy againſt the evil you fear; and, it is certain, that after what you muſt already have known and felt before you could be brought into your preſent ſituation, (on the ſuppoſitions I have now been making,) there can be no room to think of a retreat; no room, even for the wretched hope of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing leſs miſerable than the generality of thoſe that have periſhed. Your ſcheme, therefore, muſt be to make your ſalvation as ſure, and to make it as glorious as poſſible: and I know not any appointment of our bleſſed Redeemer which may have a more comfortable aſpect upon that bleſſed end than this which I am now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending to you.</p>
               <p n="8">§ 8.

                  <p>BLESSED Lord, I adore thy wiſe and gracious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments for the edification of thy church in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and in love. I thank thee that thou haſt command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thy ſervants to form themſelves into ſocieties; and I adore my gracious Saviour who hath inſtituted, as with his dying breath, the holy ſolemnity of his ſupper, to be
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:021060_0179_0FB20F165DC790D0"/>
through all ages a memorial of his dying love, and a bond of that union, which it is his ſovereign pleaſure that his people ſhould preſerve. I hope thou, Lord, art witneſs to the ſincerity with which I deſire to give my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to thee; and that I may call thee to record on my ſoul, that if I now heſitate about this particular manner of doing it, it is not becauſe I would allow my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to break any of thy commands, or to ſlight any of thy favours. I truſt, thou knoweſt, that my preſent delay ariſes only from an uncertainty as to my own du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and a fear of profaning holy things by an unworthy approach to them. Yet ſurely, O Lord, if thou haſt given me a reverence for thy command, a deſire of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with thee, and a willingneſs to devote myſelf wholly to thy ſervice, I may regard it as a token for good, that thou art diſpoſed to receive me, and that I am not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unqualified for an ordinance which I ſo highly honor, and ſo earneſtly deſire, I therefore, make it mine humble requeſt unto thee, O Lord, this day, that thou wouldſt graciouſly be pleaſed to inſtruct me in my duty, and to <q>teach me the way which I ſhould take! Examine me, O Lord, and prove me, try my reins and my heart Pſal. 26, 2.</q> Is there any ſecret ſin to the love and practice of which I would indulge? Is there any of thy precepts, in the habitual breach of which I would allow myſelf? I truſt I can appeal to thee as a witneſs that there is not. Let me not then wrong mine own ſoul by a cauſeleſs and ſinful abſence from thy ſacred table! But grant, O Lord, I beſeech thee, that thy word, thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and thy Spirit, may ſo concur, as to make my "way plain before me Prov. 15, 19!" Scatter my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining doubts, if thou ſeeſt they have no juſt foundation! Fill me with a more aſſured faith, with a more ardent love; and plead thine own cauſe with my heart in ſuch a manner as that I may not be able any longer to delay that approach, which, if I am thy ſervant indeed, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually my duty and my priviledge! in the mean time, grant that it may never be long out of my thoughts; but that I may give all diligence, if there be any remaining occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of doubt, to remove it by a more affectionate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern to avoid what ever is diſpleaſing to the eyes of thine holineſs, and to practiſe the full extent of my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty!

                     <p n="3">§ 3. [I.] In the beginning of the day, it ſhould cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be our care,—to lift up our hearts to God as ſoon as we awake, and while we are riſing,—and then, to ſet ourſelves ſeriouſly and immediately to the ſecret de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions of the morning.</p>
                     <p n="4">§ 4. For the firſt of theſe, it ſeems exceedingly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. There are ſo many things that may ſuggeſt a great variety of pious reflections and ejaculations, which are ſo obvious, that one would think a ſerious mind could hardly miſs them. The eaſe and chearfulneſs of our mind at our firſt awakening; the refreſhment we find from ſleep; the ſecurity we have enjoyed in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs ſtate; the proviſion of warm and decent ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel; the chearful light of the returning ſun; or (what is not unfit to mention to you,) the contrivances of Art, taught and furniſhed by the great author of all our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies, to ſupply us with many uſeful hours of life in the abſence of the ſun; the hope of returning to the dear ſociety of our friends; the proſpect of ſpending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother day in the ſervice of God, and the improvement
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:021060_0184_0FB20F21B59ABF70"/>
of our own minds; and, above all, the lively hope of a joyful reſurrection to an eternal day of happineſs and glory. Any of theſe particulars, and many more, which I do not mention, may furniſh us with matter of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing reflection, and chearful praiſe, while we are riſing. And, for our farther aſſiſtance, when we are alone at this time, it may not be improper to ſpeak ſometimes to ourſelves, and ſometimes to our heavenly Father, in the natural expreſſions of joy and thankfulneſs. Permit me, Sir, to add, that if we find our hearts in ſuch a frame at our firſt awakening, even that is juſt matter of praiſe, and the rather, as perhaps it is an anſwer to the prayer with which we lay down.</p>
                     <p n="5">§ 5. For the exerciſe of ſecret devotion in a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which I hope will generally be our firſt work, I cannot preſcribe an exact method to another. You muſt, my dear friend, conſult your own taſte in ſome meaſure. The conſtituent parts of the ſervice are, in the general, plain. Were I to propoſe a particular model for thoſe, who have half, or three quarters of an hour at com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, (which, with prudent conduct, I ſuppoſe moſt may have) it ſhould be this:</p>
                     <p n="6">§ 6. To begin the ſtated devotions of the day with a ſolemn act of praiſe, offered to God on our knees, and generally with a low, yet diſtinct voice; acknowledging the mercies we had been reflecting on while riſing; never forgetting to mention Chriſt, as the great foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all our enjoyments and our hopes, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thanks for the influences of the bleſſed Spirit, which have led our hearts to God, or are then engaging us to ſeek him. This, as well as other offices of devotion af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards mentioned, muſt be done attentively and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely; for, not to offer our praiſes heartily, is in the ſight of God, not to praiſe him at all. This addreſs of praiſe may properly be concluded with an expreſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newal of our covenant with God, declaring our continued repeated reſolution of being devoted to him, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of living to his glory the enſuing day.</p>
                     <p n="7">§ 7. It may be proper, after this, to take a proſpect of the day before us, ſo far as we can probably foreſee, in the general, where and how it may be ſpent; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to reflect, "How ſhall I employ myſelf for God
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:021060_0185_0FB20F2318733F30"/>
this day? What buſineſs is to be done, and in what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der? What opportunities may I expect, either of doing or of receiving good? What temptations am I like to be aſſaulted with, in any place, company, or circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which may probably occur? In what inſtances have I lately failed? and how ſhall I be ſafeſt now?"</p>
                     <p n="8">§ 8. After this review, it will be proper to offer up a ſhort prayer, begging, that God would quicken us to each of theſe foreſeen duties; that he would fortify us againſt each of theſe apprehended dangers; that he would grant us ſucceſs in ſuch or ſuch a buſineſs under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken for his glory; and alſo that he would help us to diſcover and improve unforeſeen opportunities, to reſiſt unexpected temptations, and to bear patiently and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligiouſly any afflictions which may ſurpriſe us in the day on which we are entering.</p>
                     <p n="9">§ 9. I would adviſe you after this to read ſome por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſcripture; not a great deal, nor the whole Bible in its courſe; but ſome ſelect leſſons out of its moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful parts; perhaps ten or twelve verſes; nor troubling yourſelf much about the exact connexion, or other cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical niceties which may occur, (though at other times I would recommend them to your inquiry, as you have ability and opportunity;) but conſidering them merely in a devotional and a practical view. Here take ſuch inſtructions as readily preſent themſelves to your thoughts, repeat them over to your own conſcience, and charge your heart religiouſly to obſerve them, and act upon them under a ſenſe of the divine authority which attends them. And if you pray over the ſubſtance of this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with your Bible open before you, it may impreſs your memory and your heart yet more deeply, and may form you to a copiouſneſs and variety both of thought and expreſſion in prayer.</p>
                     <p n="10">§ 10. It might be proper to cloſe theſe devotions with a pſalm or hymn; and I rejoice with you, that through the pious care of Dr. WATTS, and ſome other ſacred poets, we are provided with ſo rich a variety for the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the cloſet and family on theſe occaſions, as well as for the ſervice of the ſanctuary.</p>
                     <p n="11">§ 11. [II.] The moſt material directions which have
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:021060_0186_0FB20F2562D246B0"/>
occurred to me, relating to the progreſs of the day, are theſe:—That we be ſerious in the devotions of the day:—that we delight in the buſineſs of it, that is, in the proſecution of our worldly callings:—that we be temperate and prudent in the recreations of it:—that we carefully mark the providences of the day:—that we cautiouſly guard againſt the temptations of it:— that we keep up a lively and humble dependence upon the divine influence, ſuitable to every emergency of it: —that we govern our thoughts well in the ſolitude of the day,—and our diſcourſes well in the converſations of it. Theſe, Sir, were the heads of a ſermon which you lately heard me preach on this occaſion, and to which I know you referred in that requeſt which I am now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to anſwer. I will, therefore, touch upon the moſt material hints which fell under each of theſe particulars.</p>
                     <p n="12">§ 12. (1.) For ſeriouſneſs in devotion, whether pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic or domeſtic: Let us take a few moments, before we enter upon ſuch ſolemnities, to pauſe, and reflect, on the perfections of the God we are addreſſing to, on the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the buſineſs we are coming about, on the pleaſure and advantage of a regular and devout attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and on the guilt and ſolly of an hypocritical for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality. When engaged, let us maintain a ſtrict watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs over our own ſpirits, and check the firſt wanderings of thought, And when the duty is over, let us imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately reflect on the manner in which, it has been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and aſk our conſciences whether we have reaſon to conclude that we are accepted of God in it? For there is a certain manner of going through theſe offices, which our own hearts will immediately tell us it is impoſſible for God to approve: and if we have inadvertently fallen into it, we ought to be deeply humbled before God for it, leſt "our very prayer become ſin, Pſ. 109, 7.</p>
                     <p n="13">§ 13. (2,) As for the hours of worldly buſineſs; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be, as with you, that of the hands; or whether it be the labour of a learned life, not immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to religious matters: Let us ſet to the proſecution of it with a ſenſe of God's authority, and with a regard to his glory. Let us avoid a dreaming, ſluggiſh, indolent temper, which nods over its work, and does only the
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:021060_0187_0FB20F27135595C0"/>
buſineſs of one hour in two or three. In oppoſition to this, which runs through the life of ſome people, who yet think they are never idle, let us endeavour to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch as much as we well can in a little time; conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is but a little we have in all. And let us be habitually ſenſible of the need we have of the divine bleſſing to make our labour ſucceſsful.</p>
                     <p n="14">§ 14. (3.) For ſeaſons of diverſion: Let us take care that our recreations be well cloſen; that they be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued with a good intention, to fit us for a renewed ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the labours of life; and thus that they be only uſed in ſubordination to the honor of God, the great end of all our actions. Let us take heed that our hearts be not eſtranged from God by them; and that they do not take up too much of our time; always remembering that the faculties of the human nature, and the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the Chriſtian revelation, were not given us in vain; but that we are always to be in purſuit of ſome great and honorable end, and to indulge ourſelves in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſements and diverſions no farther than as they make a part in a ſcheme of rational and manly, benevolent and pious conduct.</p>

In this addreſs to the throne of grace it will be highly proper to intreat that God would pardon the omiſſions and offences of the day; to praiſe him for mercies temporal and ſpiritual; to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend ourſelves to his protection for the enſuing night; with proper petitions for others, whom we ought to bear on our hearts before him; and particularly for theſe friends with whom we have converſed or correſponded with in the preceding day. Many other concerns will occur, both in morning and evening prayer, which I have not here hinted at; but I did not apprehend that a full enumeration of theſe things belonged, by any means, to our preſent purpoſe.</p>
                     <p n="22">§ 22. Before I quit this head, I muſt take the liberty to remind you, that ſelf-examination is ſo important a duty that it will be worth our while to ſpend a few words upon it. And this branch of it is ſo eaſy, that when we have proper queſtions before us, any perſon of a common underſtanding may hope to go through it with advantage under a divine bleſſing. I offer you, therefore, the following queries, which I hope you will with ſuch alterations as you may judge requiſite, keep near you for daily uſe. "Did I awake, as with God this morning, and riſe with a grateful ſenſe of his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? How were the ſecret devotions of the morning performed? Did I offer my ſolemn praiſes, and renew the dedication of myſelf to God, with becoming atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:021060_0192_0FB20F32FA9F9568"/>
and ſuitable affections? Did I lay my ſcheme for the buſineſs of the day wiſely and well? How did I read the Scripture, and any other devotional or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal piece, which I might afterwards conveniently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view? Did it do my heart good, or was it a mere amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? How hath the other ſtated devotions of the day been attended, whether in the family or in public? Have I purſued the common buſineſs of this day with diligence and ſpirituality; doing every thing in ſeaſon, and with all convenient diſpatch, and "as unto the Lord Col. 2, 23?" What time have I loſt this day, in the morning or the forenoon, in the afternoon or the evening; (for theſe diviſions will aſſiſt your recollection;) and what has occaſioned the loſs of it? With what temper, and under what regulations have the recreations of this day been purſued? Have I ſeen the hand of God in my mercies, health, chearfulneſs, food, clothing, books, preſervation in journies, ſucceſs of buſineſs, converſation and kindneſs of friends, &amp;c.?—Have I ſeen it in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and particularly in little things which had a tendency to vex and diſquiet me? And with regard to this interpoſition, have I received my comforts thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and my afflictions ſubmiſſively? How have I guarded againſt the temptations of the day, particularly againſt this or that temptation which I foreſaw in the morning? Have I maintained an humble dependence on divine influences? Have I <q>lived by faith on the Son of God Gal. 2, 20,</q> and regarded Chriſt this day as my Teacher and Governor, my Atonement and Interceſſor, my Example and Guardian, my Strength and Forerunner? Have I been looking forward to death and eternity this day, and conſidered myſelf as a proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner for heaven, and through grace an expectant of it? Have I governed my thoughts well, eſpecially in ſuch or ſuch an interval of ſolitude? How was my ſubject of thought this day choſen, and how was it regarded? Have I governed my diſcourſes well in ſuch and ſuch company? Did I ſay nothing paſſionate, miſchievous, ſlanderous, imprudent, impertinent? Has my heart this day been full of love to God, and to all mankind? and have I ſought, and found, and improved opportunities of doing and of getting good?—With what attention

and improvement have I read the Scripture this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? How was ſelf-examination performed the laſt night? and how have I profited this day by any remarks I then made on former negligencies and miſtakes? With what temper did I then lye down and compoſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſleep?"</p>
                     <p n="23">§ 23. You will eaſily ſee, Sir, that theſe queſtions are ſo adjuſted as to be an abridgment of the moſt material advices I have given in this letter; and I believe I need not, to a perſon of your underſtanding, ſay any thing as to the uſefulneſs of ſuch inquiries.

Now, here it is obviouſly ſuitable to think of the divine goodneſs in add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing another day, and the mercies of it, to the former days and mercies of our life: to take notice of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence of Providence in giving us commodious habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and eaſy beds, and continuing to us ſuch health of body that we can lay ourſelves down at eaſe upon them and ſuch ſerenity of mind as leaves us any room to hope for refreſhing ſleep: a refreſhment to be ſought not merely as an indulgence to animal nature, but as what our wiſe Creator, in order to keep us humble in the midſt of ſo many infirmities, has been pleaſed to make neceſſary to our being able to purſue his ſervice with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed alacrity. Thus may our ſleeping, as well as our walking, hours be, in ſome ſenſe, devoted to God.

(4.)</hi> From its efficacy to make af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions lighter, § <hi>6 (5.)</hi> From its happy aſpect on death, § <hi>7.;</hi> and <hi>(6.)</hi> On eternity, § <hi>8.</hi> Whereas not to deſire improvement would argue a ſoul deſtitute of religion, § <hi>9.</hi> A prayer ſuited to the ſtate of a ſoul who longs to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the life recommended above.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§ 1. I HAVE been aſſigning in the preceding chapter, what I fear will ſeem to ſome of my readers ſo hard a taſk, that they will want courage to attempt it; and it is indeed a life, in many reſpects, ſo far above that of the generality of Chriſtians, that I am not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out apprehenſions that many who deſerve the name may think the directions, after all the precautions with which I have propoſed them, are carried to an unneceſſary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of nicety and ſtrictneſs. But I am perſuaded much
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:021060_0197_0FB20F3D851B8E60"/>
of the credit and comfort of Chriſtianity is loſt in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of its profeſſors fixing their aims too low, and not conceiving of their high and holy calling in ſo ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated and ſublime a view as the nature of religion would require, and the word of God would direct. I am fully convinced, that the expreſſions of <q>walking with God; of being in the fear of the Lord all the day long Prov. 23, 17.</q> and, above all, that of <q>loving the Lord our God with all our heart and ſoul, and mind and ſtrength Mark. 12, 30.</q> muſt require, if not all theſe circumſtances, yet the ſubſtance of all that I have been recommending, ſo far as we have capacity, leiſure and opportunity; and I cannot but think, that many might command more of the latter, and perhaps improve their capacities too, if they would take a due care in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of themſelves, if they would give up vain and unneceſſary diverſions, and certain indulgencies, which only ſuit and delight the lower part of our nature, and (to ſay the beſt of them) deprive us of pleaſures much better than themſelves, if they do not plunge us into guilt. Many of theſe rules would appear eaſily practicable, if men would learn to know the value of time, and particularly to redeem it from unneceſſary ſleep, which waſtes ſo many golden hours of the day: hours in which many of God's ſervants are delighting themſelves in him, and drinking in full draughts of the water of life, while theſe their brethren are ſlumbering upon their beds, and loſt in vain dreams, as far below the common entertainments of a rational creature as the pleaſures of the ſublimeſt devotion are above them.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. I know, likewiſe, that the mind is very fickle and inconſtant, and that it is a hard thing to preſerve ſuch a government and authority over our thoughts as would be very deſirable, and as the plan I have laid down will require. But ſo much of the honour of God, and ſo much of your own true happineſs depends upon it, that I beg you will give me a patient and attentive hearing while I am pleading with you; and that you will ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly examine the arguments, and then judge whether a care and conduct like that which I have adviſed be not in itſelf reaſonable; and whether it will not be highly conducive to your comfort and uſefulneſs in life, your
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:021060_0198_0FB20F3ED6FDF4B0"/>
peace in death, and the advancement and increaſe of your eternal glory.</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. Let conſcience ſay, whether ſuch a life, as I have deſcribed above, be not in itſelf highly reaſonable. Look over the ſubſtance of it again, and bring it under a cloſe examination; for I am very apprehenſive that ſome weak objections may ariſe againſt the whole, which may, in their conſequences, affect particulars, againſt which no reaſonable man would preſume to mark any objection at all. Recollect, O Chriſtian, and carry it with you in your memory and your heart, while you are purſuing his review, that you are the creature of God, that you are purchaſed with the blood of Jeſus; and then ſay whether theſe relations in which you ſtand do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand all that application and reſolution which I would engage you to. Suppoſe all the counſels I have given reduced into practice: ſuppoſe every day begun and concluded with ſuch devout breathings after God, and ſuch holy retirements for morning and evening converſe with him and your own heart: ſuppoſe a daily care in contriving how your time may be managed, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting how it has been employed: ſuppoſe this regard to God, this ſenſe of his preſence, and zeal for his glory to run through your acts of worſhip, your hours of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and recreation: ſuppoſe this attention to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, this guard againſt temptations, this dependence upon divine influence, this government of the thoughts in ſolitude and of the diſcourſes in company: nay, I will add farther, ſuppoſe every particular direction giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to be purſued, excepting when particular caſes oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, with reſpect to which you ſhall be able in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to ſay, <q>I wave it not from indolence and careleſſneſs, but becauſe I think it will juſt now be more pleaſing to God to be doing ſomething elſe;</q> which may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happen in human life where general rules are beſt concerted: ſuppoſe, I ſay, all this to be done, not for a day, or a week, but through the remainder of life, whether longer or ſhorter; and ſuppoſe this to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed at the cloſe of life, in the full exerciſe of your rational faculties, will there be reaſon to ſay, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, "I have taken too much pains in religion; the Author of my being did not deſerve all this from me:
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:021060_0199_0FB20D8ED9DACE10"/>
leſs diligence, leſs fidelity, leſs zeal, than this might have been equivalent for the blood which was ſhed for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption. A part of my heart, a part of my time, a part of my labours, might have ſufficed for him who hath given me all my powers; for him, who hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered me from that deſtruction, which would have made them my everlaſting torment; for him who is raiſing me to the regions of a bliſsful immortality." Can you with any face ſay this? If you cannot, then ſurely your conſcience bears witneſs, that all I have recommended under the limitations above is reaſonable; that duty and gratitude require it; and conſequently that, by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very allowed failure in it, you bring guilt upon your own ſoul, you offend God, and act unworthy your Chriſtian profeſſion.</p>
               <p n="4">§ 4. I intreat you farther to conſider whether ſuch a conduct as I have now been recommending would not conduce much to your comfort and uſefulneſs in life. Reflect ſeriouſly what is true happineſs Does it conſiſt in diſtance from God, or in nearneſs to him! Surely you cannot be a Chriſtian, ſurely you cannot be a ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al man, if you doubt whether communion with the great Father of our ſpirits be a pleaſure and felicity: and if it be, then ſurely they enjoy moſt of it who keep him moſt conſtantly in view. You cannot but know in your own conſcience, that it is this which makes the happineſs of heaven; and therefore the more of it any man enjoys upon earth, the more of heaven comes down into his ſoul. If you have made any trial of religion, though it be but a few months or weeks ſince you firſt became acquainted with it, you muſt be ſome judge of it upon your own experience, which have been the moſt pleaſant days of your life. Have they not been thoſe in which you have acted moſt upon theſe principles; thoſe, in which you have moſt ſteadily and reſolutely carried them through every hour of time, and every circumſtance of life? The check which you muſt, in many inſtances, give to your own inclinations might ſeem diſagreeable; but it would ſurely be overbalanced in a moſt happy manner by the ſatisfaction you would find in a conſciouſneſs of ſelf-government; in having ſuch a command of your thoughts, affections and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:021060_0200_0FB20D905F6CCCC0"/>
as is much more glorious than any authority over others can be.</p>
               <p n="5">§ 5. I would alſo intreat you to conſider the influence which ſuch a conduct as this might have upon the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of others. And it is eaſy to be ſeen it muſt be very great; as you would find your heart always diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to watch every opportunity of doing good, and to ſeize it with eagerneſs and delight. It would engage you to make it the ſtudy and buſineſs of your life to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der things in ſuch a manner that the end of one kind and uſeful action might be the beginning of another; in which you would go on as naturally as the inferior animals do in thoſe productions and actions by which mankind are relieved or enriched; or as the earth bears her ſucceſſive crops of different vegetable ſupplies. And though mankind be, in this corrupt ſtate, ſo unhappily inclined to imitate evil examples rather than good; yet it may be expected, that while your light ſhines before men ſome ſeeing your good works, will endeavour to tranſcribe them in their own lives, and ſo to <q>glorify your Father which is in heaven Matth 5, 1.</q> The charms of ſuch beautiful models would ſurely impreſs ſome, and incline them at leaſt to attempt an imitation; and every attempt would diſpoſe to another. And thus, through the divine goodneſs, you might be entitled to a ſhare in the praiſe, and the reward, not only of the good you had immediately done yourſelf, but likewiſe of that which you had engaged others to do. And no eye but that of an all ſearching God can ſee into what diſtant times or places the bleſſed conſequences may reach. In every inſtance in which theſe conſequences appear, it will put a generous and ſublime joy into your heart, which no worldly proſperity could afford, and which would be the livelieſt emblem of that high delight which the bleſſed God feels, in ſeeing and making his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures happy.</p>
               <p n="6">§ 6. It is true indeed, that, amidſt all theſe pious and benevolent cares afflictions may come, and in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure interrupt you in the midſt of your pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

a teſtimony of conſcience before God and man. Delightful will it be to go back to paſt ſcenes in your pleaſing review, and to think that you have not only been ſincerely humbling yourſelf for thoſe paſt offences, which afflictions may bring to your remembrance; but that you have given ſubſtantial proofs of the ſincerity of that humiliation, by a real reformation of what has been amiſs, and by acting with ſtrenuous and vigorous reſolution on the contrary principle. And while con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with God, and doing good to men, are made the great buſineſs and pleaſure of life, you will find a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand opportunities of enjoyment, even in the midſt of thoſe afflictions, which would render you ſo incapable of reliſhing the pleaſures of ſenſe, that the mention of them might, in thoſe circumſtances, ſeem an inſult and a reproach.</p>
               <p n="7">§ 7. At length death will come; that ſolemn and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant hour, which hath been paſſed through by ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands who have in the main lived ſuch a life, and by ſo many millions who have neglected it. And let conſcience ſay, if there was ever one of all theſe mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions who had then any reaſon to rejoice in that neglect; or any one, among the moſt ſtrict and exemplary Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, who then lamented that his heart and life had been too zealouſly devoted to God? Let conſcience ſay, whether they have wiſhed to have a part of that time, which they have thus employed, given back to them again, that they might be more conformed to this world; that they might plunge themſelves deeper into its amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or purſue its honours, its poſſeſſions or its plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures with greater eagerneſs than they had done? If you were yourſelf dying, and a dear friend or child ſtood near you, and this book, and the laſt chapter of it ſhould chance to come into your thoughts, would you caution that friend or child againſt conducting himſelf by ſuch rules as I have advanced? The queſtion may perhaps ſeem unneceſſary where the anſwer is ſo plain and ſo certain. Well then, let me beſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

you on a ſudden, and you ſhould be called into eternity at an hour's or a minute's warning, would you not wiſh that your laſt day ſhould have been thus begun, and the courſe of it, if it were a day of health and activity, ſhould have been thus managed! Would you not wiſh that your Lord ſhould find you engaged in ſuch thoughts, and in ſuch purſuits? Would not the paſſage, the flight from earth to heaven, be moſt eaſy, moſt pleaſant, in this view and connection? And, on the other hand, if death ſhould make more gradual approaches, would not the remembrance of ſuch a pious, holy, humble, diligent, and uſeful life, make a dying bed much ſofter and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier than it would otherwiſe be? You would not die de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon theſe things: God forbid that you ſhould! Senſible of your many imperfections, you would, no doubt deſire to throw yourſelf at the feet of Chriſt, that you might appear before God adorned with his righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and waſhed from your ſins in his blood. You would alſo, with your dying breath, aſcribe to the riches of his grace every good diſpoſition you had found in your heart, and every worthy action you had been enabled to perform: but would it not give you a delight, worthy of being purchaſed with ten thouſand worlds, to reflect, that <q>his grace beſtowed on you had not been in vain 1 Cor. 15, 10;</q> but that you had, from an humble principle of grateful love, glorified your heavenly Father on earth, and, in ſome degree, though not with the perfection you could deſire, <q>finiſhed the work which he had given you to do John 17, 4:</q> that you had been living for many years paſt as on the borders of heaven, and endeavouring to form your heart and life to the temper and manners of its inhabitants?</p>
               <p n="8">§ 8 And, once more, let me intreat you to reflect on the view you will have of this matter when you come into a world of glory, if (which I hope will be the happy caſe,) divine mercy conduct you thither. Will not your reception there be affected by your care, or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence, in this holy courſe? Will it appear an indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent thing in the eye of the bleſſed Jeſus, who diſtributes the crowns, and allots the thrones there, whether you have been among the moſt zealous, or the moſt indolent of his ſervants? Surely you muſt wiſh to have <q>an

entrance adminiſtered unto you abundantly into the kingdom of your Lord and Saviour 2 Pet. 1, 11:</q> and what can more certainly conduce to it than to be always abounding in his work 1 Cor. 15, 58? You cannot think ſo meanly of that glorious ſtate as to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that you ſhall there look round about with a ſecret diſappointment, and ſay in your heart, that you over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued the inheritance you have received, and purſued it with too much earneſtneſs. You will not ſurely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain that it had too many of your thoughts and cares: but, on the contrary, you have the higheſt reaſon to believe, that if any thing were capable of exciting your indignation and your grief there, it would be that, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt ſo many motives, and ſo many advantages, you exerted yourſelf no more in the proſecution of ſuch a prize.</p>
               <p n="9">§ 9, But I will not enlarge on ſo clear a caſe, and therefore conclude the chapter with reminding you, that to allow yourſelf deliberately to ſit down ſatisfied with any imperfect attainments in religion, and to look upon a more confirmed and improved ſtate of it as what you do not deſire, nay as what you ſecretly reſolve that you will not purſue, is one of the moſt fatal ſigns we can well imagine that you are an entire ſtranger to the firſt principles of it.</p>

that, beſides the general oppoſition, which I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly mentioned, as like to attend you in your firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance on a religious life, you will find, even after you have reſolutely broke through this, a variety, of hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances in any attempts of exemplary piety, and in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of a remarkably ſtrict and edifying courſe, will preſent themſelves daily in your path. And whereas you may, by a few reſolute efforts baffle ſome of the former ſort of enemies, theſe will be perpetually renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their onſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>, and a vigorous ſtruggle muſt be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally maintained with them. Give me leave now, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to be particular in my cautions againſt ſome of the chief of them. And here I would inſiſt upon the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which will ariſe from indolence and the love of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, from vain company, and from worldly cares. Each of theſe may prove enſnaring to any, and eſpecially to young perſons, to whom I would now have ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular regard.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. I entreat you, therefore, in the firſt place, that you would guard againſt a ſluggiſh and indolent temper. The love of eaſe inſinuates itſelf into the heart, under a variety of plauſible pretences, which are often allowed to paſs, when temptations of a groſſer nature would not be admitted. The miſpending a little time ſeems to wiſe and good men but a ſmall matter; yet this ſometimes runs them into great inconveniences. It often leads them to break in upon the ſeaſons regularly allotted to devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to defer buſineſs. which might immediately be done, but being put off from day to day, is not done at all; and therefore the ſervices of life are at leaſt dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and the rewards of eternity diminiſhed propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably; not to inſiſt upon it, that very frequently lays the ſoul open to farther temptations, by which it falls, in conſequence of being found unemployed. Be, therefore, ſuſpicious of the firſt approaches of this kind. Remember, that the ſoul of man is an active being, and that it muſt end its pleaſure in activity. Gird up, therefore, the "loins of your mind 1 Pet. 1, 13." En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to keep yourſelf always well employed. Be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, if I may with humble reverence uſe the expreſſion, in your appointments with God. Meet him early in the morning; and ſay not with the ſluggard, when the
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:021060_0208_0FB20DA2AB3A77A0"/>
proper hour of riſing is come, <q>A little more ſleep, a little more ſlumber Prov. 6, 1.</q> That time which prudence ſhall adviſe you, give to converſation, and to other recreations; but when that is elapſed, and no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſeen and important engagement preſents, riſe and be gone. Quit the company of your deareſt friends, and retire to your proper buſineſs whether it be in the field, the ſhop, or the cloſet: for by acting contrary to the ſecret dictates of your mind, as to what it is juſt at the preſent moment beſt to do, though it be but in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpending half an hour, ſome degree of guilt is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, and a habit is cheriſhed, which may draw after it much worſe conſequences. Conſider, therefore, what duties are to be diſpatched, and in what ſeaſons. Form your plan as prudently as you can, and purſue it reſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: unleſs any unexpected incident ariſes, which leads you to conclude that duty calls you another way. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowances for ſuch unthought of interruptions muſt be made; but if, in conſequence of this, you are obliged to omit any thing of importance which you purpoſed to have done to-day. do it if poſſible to-morrow: and do not cut yourſelf out new work till the former plan be diſpatched; unleſs you really judge it, not merely more amuſing, but more important. And always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that a ſervant of Chriſt ſhould ſee to it that he determine on theſe occaſions as in his Maſter's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. Guard alſo againſt an exceſſive love of ſenſitive and animal pleaſure, as that which will be a great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to you in that religious courſe which I have now been urging. You cannot but know that Chriſt has told us, that <q>a man muſt deny himſelf, and take up his croſs daily, if he deſire to become his diſciple Luke 9, 23. Chriſt the Son of God, the Former and the Heir of all things, pleaſed not himſelf Rom. 15, 1;</q> but ſubmitted to want, to difficulties and hardſhips, in the way of duty, and ſome of them in the extremeſt kind and degree, for the glory of God, and the ſalvation of men. In this way we are to follow him; and as we know not how ſoon we may be called even to <q>reſiſt unto blood, ſtriving againſt ſin Heb. 12, 4,</q> it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly beſt to accuſtom ourſelves to that diſcipline which
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:021060_0209_0FB20DA5A377E520"/>
we may poſſibly be called out to exerciſe, even in ſuch rigorous heights. A ſoft and delicate life will give force to temptations, which might eaſily be ſubdued by one who has habituated himſelf to <q>endure hardſhip, as a ſoldier of Jeſus Chriſt 2 Tim 2, 3.</q> It alſo produces an attachment to this world, and an unwillingneſs to leave it; which ill becomes thoſe who are ſtrangers and pilgrims on earth, and who expect ſo ſoon to be called away to that better country which they profeſs to ſeek Heb. 11, 13—16. Add to this, that what the world calls a life of pleaſure, is neceſſarily a life of expence too, and may, perhaps, lead you, as it hath done many others, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially many who have been ſetting out in the world, beyond the limits which providence has aſſigned; and ſo, after a ſhort courſe of indulgence, may produce pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable want. And while in other caſes it is true, that pity ſhould be ſhown to the poor, this is a poverty that is juſtly contemptible, becauſe it is the effect of a man's own folly; and when your want thus <q>comes upon you as an armed man Prov. 6, 11,</q> you will not only find yourſelf ſtripped of the capacity you might otherwiſe have ſecured for performing thoſe works of charity, which are ſo ornamental to a Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, but, probably, will be under ſtrong temptations to ſome low artifice, or mean compliance, quite beneath the Chriſtian character, and that of an upright man. Many who once made a high profeſſion, after a ſeries of ſuch ſorry and ſcandalous ſhifts, have fallen into the infamy of bankrupts, and of the worſt kinds of bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts; I mean ſuch as have laviſhed away on themſelves what was indeed the property of others, and ſo have injured, and perhaps ruined, the induſtrious, to feed a fooliſh, luxurious, or oſtentatious humour, which, while indulged, was the ſhame of their own families, and, when it can be indulged no longer, is their torment. This will be a terrible reproach to religion: ſuch a reproach to it, that a good man would rather chuſe to live on bread and water, or indeed to die for want of them, than to occaſion it.</p>
               <p n="4">§ 4. Guard, therefore, I beſeech you, againſt any thing which might tend that way, eſpecially by diligence in buſineſs, and by prudence and frugality in expence;
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:021060_0210_0FB20DA6DF3424D8"/>
which, by the divine bleſſing, may have a very happy influence to make your affairs proſperous, your health vigorous, and your mind eaſy. But this cannot be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without keeping a reſolute watch over yourſelf, and ſtrenuouſly refuſing to comply with many propoſals which indolence or ſenſuality will offer in very plauſible forms, and for which it will plead that it aſks but very little. Take heed, leſt, in this reſpect, you imitate thoſe fond parents, who, by indulging their children in every little thing they have a mind to, encourage them, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible degrees, to grow ſtill more encroaching and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious in their demands; as if they choſe to be ruined with them, rather than to check in them what ſeems a trifle. Remember and conſider that excellent remark, ſealed by the ruin of ſo many thouſands; <q>He that deſpiſeth ſmall things, ſhall fall by little and little.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="5">§ 5. In this view, give me leave alſo ſeriouſly and tenderly to caution you, my dear reader, againſt the ſnares of vain company. I ſpeak not, as before, of that company, which is openly licentious and profane. I hope there is ſomething now in your temper and views which would engage you to turn away from ſuch with deteſtation and horror. But I beſeech you to conſider, that thoſe companions may be very dangerous who might at firſt give you but very little alarm; I mean thoſe, who, though not the declared enemies of religion, and profeſſed followers of vice and diſorder, yet nevertheleſs have no practical ſenſe of divine things on their hearts, ſo far as can be judged by their converſation and beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour. You muſt often of neceſſity be with ſuch perſons, and Chriſtianity not only allows, but requires, that you ſhould, on all expedient occaſions of intercourſe with them, treat them with civility and reſpect: but chuſe not ſuch for your moſt intimate friends, and do not contrive to ſpend moſt of your leiſure moments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. For ſuch converſe has a ſenſible tendency to alienate the ſoul from God, and to render it unfit for all ſpiritual communion with him. To convince you of this, do but reflect on your own experience, when you have been for many hours together among perſons of ſuch a character. Do you not find yourſelf more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed for devotional exerciſes? Do you not find your
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:021060_0211_0FB20DA863663D98"/>
heart, by inſenſible degrees, more and more inclined to a conformity to this world, and to look with a ſecret diſreliſh on thoſe objects and employments to which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon directs as the nobleſt and the beſt? Obſerve the firſt ſymptoms, and guard againſt the ſnare in time: and, for this purpoſe endeavour to form friendſhips founded in piety, and ſupported by it. "Be a companion of them that fear God, and of them that keep his precepts Pſ. 119, 63." You well know, that in the ſight of God "they are the excellent of the earth;" let them therefore "be all your delight Pſal. 16, 3." And that the peculiar benefit of their friendſhip may not be loſt, endeavour to make the beſt of the hours you ſpend with them. The wiſeſt of men has obſerved, that when "council in the heart of a man is like deep waters," that is, when it lyes low and concealed, "a man of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding will draw it out Prov. 20, 5." Endeavour therefore, on ſuch occaſions, ſo far as you can do it with decency and convenience, to give the converſation a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious turn. And when ſerious and uſeful ſubjects are ſtarted in your preſence, lay hold of them, and cultivate them; and, for that purpoſe, <q>let the word of Chriſt dwell richly in you Col. 3, 16.</q> and be continually made "the man of your counſel Pſal. 119, 24."</p>
               <p n="6">§ 6. If it be ſo, it will ſecure you, not only from the ſnares of idleneſs and luxury, but from the contagion of every bad example. And it will alſo engage you to guard againſt thoſe exceſſive hurries of worldly buſineſs, which would fill up all your time and thoughts, and thereby choke the good word of God, and render it in a great meaſure, if not quite unfruitful Matth. 13, 22. Young people are generally of an enterpriſing diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: having experienced comparatively little of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue of buſineſs, and of the diſappointments and incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances of life, they eaſily ſwallow them up, and anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate them in their imagination, and fancy that their ſpirit, their application and addreſs, will be able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter and ſurmount every obſtacle or hindrance. But the event proves it otherwiſe. Let me intreat you, therefore, to be cautious how you plunge yourſelf into a greater variety of buſineſs than you are capable of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging as you ought, that is, in conſiſtence with the
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:021060_0212_0FB20DABC41286B8"/>
care of your ſouls, and the ſervice of God; which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ought not on any pretence to be neglected. It is true indeed, that a prudent regard to your worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt would require ſuch a caution; as it is obvious to every careful obſerver, that multitudes are undone by graſping at more than they can conveniently manage.— Hence it has frequently been ſeen, that while they have ſeemed <q>reſolved to be rich, they have pierced themſelves through with many ſorrows 1 Tim. 6, 10.</q> have ruined their own families, and drawn down many others into deſolation with them: whereas, could they have been contented with moderate employments, and moderate gains, they might have proſpered in their buſineſs, and might, by ſure degrees, under a divine bleſſing, have advanced to great and honourable increaſe. But if there were no danger at all to be apprehended on this head; if you were as certain of becoming rich and great as you are of perplexing and fatiguing your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the attempt; conſider, I beſeech you, how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious theſe enjoyments are. Conſider how often a <q>plentiful table becomes a ſnare, and that which ſhould have been for a man's welfare becomes a trap Pſ. 69, 22.</q> Forget not that ſhort leſſon, which is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of the higheſt wiſdom, <q>One thing is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Luke 10, 4. Be daily thinking, while the gay and great things of life are glittering before your eyes, how ſoon death will come, and impoveriſh you at once; how ſoon it will ſtrip you of all poſſeſſions but thoſe which a naked ſoul can carry along with it into eternity, when it drops the body into the grave.</q> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERNITY! ETERNITY! ETERNITY! Carry the view of it about with you, if it be poſſible, through every hour of waking life; and fully perſuaded that you have no buſineſs, no intereſt in life, that is inconſiſtent with it: for whatſoever would be injurious to this view, is not your buſineſs, is not your intereſt. You ſee indeed, that the generality of men act as if they thought the great thing which God requires of them, in order to ſecure his favour, was to get as much of the world as poſſible; at leaſt, as much as they can without any groſs immorality, and without riſking the loſs of all, for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little addition. And, as if it were to abet this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:021060_0213_0FB20DADCC006728"/>
they tell others, and perhaps tell themſelves, they only ſeek opportunities of greater uſefulneſs, but, in effect, if they mean any thing more by this than a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of uſefulneſs, which, when they have it, they will not exert, they generally deceive themſelves; and one way or another, it is a vain pretence. In moſt inſtances men ſeek the world,—either that they may hoard up riches for the mean and ſcandalous ſatisfaction of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them while they are living, and of thinking, that when they are dead, it will be ſaid of them, that they have left ſo many hundreds or thouſands of pounds behind them; very probably to inſnare their children, or other heirs, (for the vanity is not peculiar to thoſe who have children of their own: —or elſe, that they may laviſh away their riches on their luſts, and drown themſelves in a gulph of ſenſuality, in which, if reaſon be not loſt, religion is ſoon ſwallowed up, and, with it, all the nobleſt pleaſures which can enter into the heart of man. In this view, the generality of rich people ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me objects of much greater compaſſion than the poor; eſpecially as when both live (which is frequently the caſe) without any fear of God before their eyes, the rich abuſe the greater variety and abundance of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and therefore will probably feel in that world of future ruin which awaits impenitent ſinners, a more exquiſite ſenſe of their miſery.</p>
               <p n="7">§ 7. And let me obſerve to you, my dear reader, leſt you ſhould think yourſelf ſecure from any ſuch danger, that we have great reaſon to apprehend there are many now in a very wretched ſtate, who once thought ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of religion when they were firſt ſetting out, in lower circumſtances of life, but they have ſince forſaken God for Mammon, and are now priding themſelves in thoſe golden chains, which, in all probability, before it be long, will leave them to remain in thoſe of darkneſs. When, therefore, an attachment to the world may be followed with ſuch fatal conſequences, <q>let not thine heart envy ſinners Prov. 22, 17;</q> and do not, out of a deſire of gaining what they have, be guilty of ſuch folly, as to expoſe yourſelf to this double danger of fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the attempt, or of being undone by the ſucceſs of it. Contract your deſire: endeavour to be eaſy and
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:021060_0214_0FB20DAF178A90C8"/>
content with a little: and if Providence call you out to act in a larger ſphere, ſubmit to it in obedience to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; but number it among the trials of life, which it will require a larger proportion of grace to bear well. For, be aſſured, that as affairs, and intereſt multiply, cares and duties will certainly increaſe, and probably diſappointments and ſorrows will increaſe in an equal proportion.</p>
               <p n="8">§ 8. On the whole, learn, by divine grace, to die to the preſent world; to look upon it as a low ſtate of being, which God never intended for the final and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete happineſs, or the ſupreme care, of any one of his children; a world, where ſomething is indeed to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, but chiefly from himſelf; where a great deal is to be borne with patience and reſignation; and where ſome important duties are to be performed, and a courſe of diſcipline to be paſſed through, by which you are to be formed for a better ſtate; to which, as a Chriſtian, you are near, and to which God will call you, perhaps on a ſudden but undoubtedly, if you hold on your way, in the fitteſt time, and the moſt convenient manner. Refer, therefore, all this to him. Let your hopes and fears, your expectations and deſires, with regard to this world be kept as low as poſſible; and all your thoughts be united, as much as may be, in this one centre, what it is that God would, in preſent circumſtances, have you to be; and what is that method of conduct by which you may moſt effectually pleaſe and glorify him?</p>

IF I am ſo happy as to prevail upon you in the exhortations and cautions I have given, you will probably go on with pleaſure and comfort in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and your path will generally be <q>like the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing light, which ſhineth more and more until the perfect day Prov. 4, 18.</q> Yet I dare not flatter

Much do I fear that you will feel your mind languiſh and tire in the good ways of God! nay, that you may be prevailed upon to take ſome ſtep out of them, and may thus fall a prey to ſome of thoſe temptations which you now look upon with a holy ſcorn. The probable conſequence of this will be, that God will hide his face from you; that he will ſtretch forth his afflicting hand againſt you; and that you will ſtill ſee your ſorrowful moments, how chearfully ſoever you may now be <q>rejoicing in the Lord, and joying in the God of your ſalvation Hab. 3, 18.</q> I hope, therefore, it may be of ſome ſervice, if this too probable event ſhould happen, to conſider theſe caſes a little more particularly: and I heartily pray that God would make what I ſhall ſay concerning them the means of reſtoring, comforting, and ſtrengthening your ſoul, if he ever ſuffers you in any degree to deviate from him.</p>

Our natures are ſo framed, that the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty of objects ſtrikes them in ſomething of a peculiar manner; not to urge how much more eaſily our paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are impreſſed in the earlier years of life, than when we are more advanced in the journey of it. This, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, is not ſufficiently conſidered. Too great a ſtre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="205" facs="unknown:021060_0218_0FB20DB817438160"/>
you can hardly be too frequently told, that reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion conſiſts chiefly "in the reſolution of the will for God, and in a conſtant care to avoid whatever we are perſuaded he would diſapprove, to diſpatch the work he has aſſigned us in life, and to promote his glory in the happineſs of mankind." To this we are chiefly to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, looking in all to the ſimplicity and purity of thoſe motives from which we act, which we know are chiefly regarded by that God who ſearches the heart; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ourſelves before him at the ſame time under a ſenſe of our many imperfections, and flying to the blood of Chriſt and the grace of the goſpel.</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. Having given this precaution, I will now a little more particularly deſcribe the caſe which I call the ſtate of a Chriſtian, who is declining in religion, ſo far as it does not fall in with thoſe which I ſhall conſider in the following chapters. And I muſt obſerve, that it chiefly conſiſts "in a forgetfulneſs of divine objects, and a remiſſneſs in thoſe various duties to which we ſtand engaged by that ſolemn ſurrender which we have made of ourſelves to the ſervice of God." There will be a variety of ſymptoms, according to the different circumſtances and relations in which the Chriſtian is placed; but ſome will be of a more univerſal kind. It will be peculiarly proper to touch on theſe; and ſo much the rather as theſe declenſions are often unobſerved, like the grey hairs which were upon Ephraim, when he knew it not Hoſ. 7 9.</p>
               <p n="4">§ 4. Should you, my good reader, fall into this ſtate, it will probably firſt diſcover itſelf by a failure in the duties of the cloſet. Not that I ſuppoſe they will at firſt or certainly conclude, that they will at all be wholly omitted, but they will be run over in a cold and formal manner. Sloth, or ſome of thoſe other ſnares which I cautioned you againſt in the former chapter, will ſo far prevail upon you, that though perhaps you know and recollect that the proper ſeaſon for retirement is come, you will ſometimes indulge yourſelf upon your bed in the morning, ſometimes in converſation or buſineſs in the evening, ſo as not to have convenient time for it: or perhaps, when you come into your cloſet at that ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſome favourite book you are deſirous to read, ſome correſpondence that you chuſe to carry on, or ſome other
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:021060_0219_0FB20DBBABC2BE58"/>
amuſement will preſent itſelf, and plead to be dipatched firſt. This will probably take up more time than you imagine; and then ſecret prayer will be hurried over, and perhaps reading the Scripture quite neglected. You will plead perhaps, that it is but for once; but the ſame allowance will be made a ſecond and a third time; and it will grow more eaſy and familiar to you each time than it was the laſt. And thus God will be mocked, and your own ſoul will be defrauded of its ſpiritual meals, if I may be allowed the expreſſion; the word of God will be ſlighted, and ſelf-examination quite diſuſed; and ſecret prayer itſelf will grow a burden rather than a delight; and a trifling ceremony rather than a devout homage, ſit for the acceptance of our Father who is in heaven.</p>
               <p n="5">§ 5. If immediate and reſolute meaſures be not taken for our recovery from theſe declenſions, they will ſpread farther, and reach the acts of ſocial worſhip. You will feel the effect in your families, and in public ordinances. And if you do not feel it, the ſymptoms will be ſo much the worſe. Wandering thoughts will (as it were) eat out the very heart of theſe duties. It is not, I believe, the privilege of the moſt eminent Chriſtians to be entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly free from them: but, probably, in theſe circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, you will find but few intervals of ſtrict attention, or of any thing which wears the appearance of inward de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion. And when theſe heartleſs duties are concluded, there will ſcarce be a reflection made how little God hath been enjoyed in them, how little he hath been ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured by them. Perhaps the ſacrament of the Lord's ſupper, being ſo admirably adapted to fix the attention of the ſoul, and to excite its warmeſt exerciſe of holy affections, may be the laſt ordinance in which theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſions will be felt. And yet who can ſay that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred table is a privileged place? Having been unneceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſtraitened in your preparations, you will attend with leſs fixedneſs and enlargement of heart than uſual. And perhaps a diſſatisfaction in the review, when there has been a remarkable alienation or inſenſibility of mind, may occaſion a diſpoſition to forſake your place and your duty there. And when your ſpiritual enemies have once gained this point upon you, it is probable you will
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:021060_0220_0FB20DBD915EEE10"/>
fall by ſwifter degrees than ever, and your reſiſtance to their attempts will grow weaker and weaker.</p>
               <p n="6">§ 6. When your love to God our Father, and to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt fails, your fervour of Chriſtian affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to your brethren in Chriſt will proportionally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, and your concern for uſefulneſs in life abate; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially, where any thing is to be done for ſpiritual edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. You will find one excuſe or another for the neglect of religious diſcourſe, perhaps not only among neighbours and Chriſtian friends, when very convenient opportunities offer, but even with regard to thoſe who are members of your own families, and to thoſe who, if you are fixed in the ſuperior relations of life, are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to your care.</p>
               <p n="7">§ 7. With this remiſſneſs, an attachment either to ſenſual pleaſure or to worldly buſineſs will increaſe. For the ſoul muſt have ſomething to employ it, and ſomething to delight itſelf in; and as it turns to one or the other of theſe temptations of one ſort or another will preſent themſelves. In ſome inſtances, perhaps the ſtricteſt bounds of temperance, and the regular appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of life, may be broken in upon through a fondneſs for company, and the entertainments which often attend it. In other inſtances, the intereſts of life appearing greater than they did before, and taking up more of the mind, contrary intereſts of other perſons may throw you into diſquietude, or plunge you in debate and contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in which it is extremely difficult to preſerve either the ſerenity or the innocence of the ſoul. And perhaps, if miniſters and other Chriſtian friends obſerve this, and endeavour, in a plain and faithful way, to reduce you from your wandering, a falſe delicacy of mind, often contracted in ſuch a ſtate as this, will render theſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts extremely diſagreeable. The ulcer of the ſoul (if I may be allowed the expreſſion) will not bear being touched when it moſt needs it; and one of the moſt generous and ſelf denying inſtances of Chriſtian friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhall be turned into an occaſion of coldneſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte, yea perhaps of enmity.</p>
               <p n="8">§ 8. And poſſibly, to ſum up all, this diſordered ſtate of mind may lead you into ſome prejudices againſt thoſe very principles which might be moſt effectual or your

recovery: and your great enemy may ſucceed ſo far in his attempts againſt you as to perſuade you that you have loſt nothing in religion, when you have almoſt loſt all. He may, very probably, lead you to conclude, that your former devotional frames were mere fits of enthuſiaſm; and that the holy regularity of your walk before God was an unneceſſary ſtrictneſs and ſcrupulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. Nay, you may think it a great improvement in underſtanding that you have learnt from ſome new maſters, that if a man treat his fellow creatures with humanity and good nature, judging and reviling only thoſe who would diſturb others by the narrowneſs of their notions (for theſe are generally exempted from other objects of the moſt univerſal and diſintereſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence ſo often boaſted of) he muſt neceſſarily be in a very good ſtate, though he pretend not to converſe much with God, provided that he think reſpectfully of him, and do not provoke him by any groſs immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities.</p>
               <p n="9">§ 9. I mention this in the laſt ſtage of religious de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clenſions, becauſe I apprehend that to be its proper place; and I fear it will be found by experience to ſtand upon the very confines of that groſs apoſtaſy into deliberate and preſumptuous ſin, which will claim our conſideration under the next head: and becauſe, too, it is that ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptom which moſt effectually tends to prevent the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and even the uſe, of any proper remedies, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of a fond and fatal apprehenſion that they are needleſs. It is, if I may borrow the ſmile, like thoſe fits of lethargic drowſineſs which often precede apoplexies and death.</p>
               <p n="10">§ 10. It is by no means my deſign at this time to reckon up, much leſs to conſider at large, thoſe danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous principles which are now ready to poſſeſs the mind, and to lay the foundation of a falſe and treacherous peace. Indeed they are in different inſtances various, and ſometimes run into oppoſite extremes; but if God awaken you to read your Bible with attention, and give you to feel the Spirit with which it is written, almoſt every page will flaſh in conviction upon the mind, and ſpread a light to ſcatter and diſperſe theſe ſhades of darkneſs.</p>
               <p n="11">
                  <pb n="209" facs="unknown:021060_0221_0FB20DBF238191B0"/>§ 11. What I chiefly intend in this addreſs is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage you, if poſſible, as ſoon as you perceive the firſt ſymptoms of theſe declenſions, to be upon your guard, and to endeavour as ſpeedily as poſſible to recover your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from them. And I would remind you, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy muſt begin where the firſt cauſe of complaint prevailed, I mean, in the cloſet. Take ſome time for recollection, and aſk your own conſcience ſeriouſly, How matters ſtand between the bleſſed God and your ſoul? Whether they are as they once were, and as you could wiſh them to be, if you ſaw your life juſt drawing to a period, and were to paſs immediately into the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſtate? One ſerious thought of eternity ſhames a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand vain excuſes, with which, in the forgetfulneſs of it, we are ready to delude our own ſouls. And when you feel that ſecret miſgiving of heart, which will naturally ariſe on this occaſion, do not endeavour to palliate the matter, and to find out flight and artful coverings for what you cannot forbear ſecretly condemning; but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly fall under the conviction, and be humbling for it. Pour out your heart before God, and ſeek the renewed influences of his Spirit and grace. Return with more exactneſs to ſecret devotion, and to ſelf-examination. Read the Scripture with yet greater diligence, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the more devotional and ſpiritual parts of it. Labour to ground it in your heart, and to feel what you have reaſon to believe the ſacred penmen felt when they wrote, ſo far as circumſtances may agree. Open your ſoul with all ſimplicity to every leſſon which the word of God would teach you; and guard againſt thoſe things which you perceive to alienate your mind from inward religion, though there be nothing criminal in the things themſelves. They may perhaps in the general be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; to ſome, poſſibly, they may be expedient; but if they produce ſuch an effect, as was mentioned above, it is certain they are not convenient for you. In theſe circumſtances, above all, ſeek the converſe of thoſe Chriſtians whoſe progreſs in religion ſeems moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and who adorn their profeſſion in the moſt ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner. Labour to obtain their temper and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and lay open your caſe and your heart to them with all the freedom which prudence will permit. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy

yourſelf at ſeaſons of leiſure in reading practical and devotional books, in which the mind and the heart of the pious author is transfuſed into the work, and in which you can (as it were) taſte the genuine ſpirit of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity. And, to conclude, Take the firſt opportunity that preſents itſelf of making an approach to the table of the Lord, and ſpare neither time nor pains in the moſt ſerious preparation for it. There renew your co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with God; put your ſoul anew into the hand of Chriſt, and endeavour to view the wonders of his dying love in ſuch a manner as may rekindle the languiſhing flame, and quicken you to more vigorous reſolutions than ever, <q>to live unto him who died for you 2 Cor. 5, 15.</q> And watch over your own heart, that the good impreſſions you then felt may continue. Reſt not till you have obtained as confirmed a ſtate in religion as you ever knew. Reſt not till you have made a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er progreſs than before: for it is certain more is yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; and it is only by a certain zeal to go forward that you can be ſecure from the danger of going backward, and of revolting more and more.</p>
               <p n="12">§ 12. I only add, that it is neceſſary to take theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions as ſoon as poſſible; or you will probably find a much ſwifter progreſs than you are aware in the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill road; and you may poſſibly be left of God to fall into ſome groſs and aggravated ſin, ſo as to fill your conſcience with an agony and horror, which the pain of broken bones Pſ. 51, 8. can but imperfectly expreſs.</p>

Whence,
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:021060_0224_0FB29E45CA303B08"/>
O Lord, whence this ſad change, which I now experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in the frame and temper of my mind towards thee? Whence this alienation of my ſoul from thee? Why can I not come to thee with all the endearments of filial love as I once could? Why is thy ſervice ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsly attended, if attended at all? and why are the exerciſes of it which were once my greateſt pleaſure, become a burden to me? "Where, O God, is the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs I once ſpake of Gal. 4, 15." when my joy in thee as my heavenly Father was ſo conſpicuous that ſtrangers might have obſerved it; and when my heart did ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflow with love to thee, and with zeal for thy ſervice, that it was matter of ſelf-denial to me to limit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the genuine expreſſions of thoſe ſtrong emotions of my ſoul, even where prudence and duty required it?</p>
                  <p>Alas, Lord, whither am I fallen! thine eyes ſees me ſtill; but oh, how unlike what it once ſaw me! Cold and inſenſible as I am, I muſt bluſh on the reflection.— Thou "ſeeſt me in ſecret Matth. 6, 6." and ſeeſt me, perhaps, often amuſing myſelf with trifles in thoſe ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which I uſed ſolemnly to devote to thine immediate ſervice.—Thou ſeeſt me coming into thy preſence as by conſtraint; and when I am before thee, ſo ſtraiten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my ſpirit, that I hardly know what to ſay to thee, though thou art the God with whom I have to do, and though the keeping up an humble and dutiful correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence with thee is beyond all compariſon the moſt important buſineſs of my life. And even when I am ſpeaking to thee, with how much coldneſs and forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is it? It is perhaps the work of the imagination, the labour of the lips; but where are thoſe ardent deſires, thoſe intenſe breathings after God, which I once felt? Where is that pleaſing repoſe in thee which I was once conſcious of, as being near my divine reſt, as being hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in that nearneſs, and reſolving that, if poſſible, I would no more be removed from it? But, oh, how far am I now removed! When theſe ſhort devotions, if they may be called devotions, are over, in what long intervals do I forget thee, and appear ſo little animated with thy love, ſo little devoted to thy ſervice, that a ſtranger might converſe with me a conſiderable time without knowing that I had ever formed any acquaintance with thee, without diſcovering that I had ſo much as known
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:021060_0225_0FB29E4BD1D57DA0"/>
or heard any thing of God!—Thou calleſt me to thine houſe, O Lord, on thine own day; but how heartleſs are my ſervices there? I offer thee no more than a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe. My thoughts and affections are ingroſſed with other objects, while I <q>draw near thee with my mouth, and honour thee with my lips Iſa. 29, 13.</q> Thou calleſt me to thy table; but my heart is ſo frozen, that it hardly melts even at the foot of the croſs; hardly feels any efficacy in the blood of Jeſus. Oh wretched creature that I am! Unworthy of being called thine! unworthy of a place among thy children, or of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſituation in thy family; rather worthy to be caſt out, to be forſaken, yea, to be utterly deſtroyed!</p>
                  <p>Is this, Lord, the ſervice which I once promiſed, and which thou haſt ſo many thouſand reaſons to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect? Are theſe the returns I am making for thy daily providential care, for the ſacrifice of thy Son, for the communications of thy Spirit, for the pardon of my numberleſs aggravated ſins, for the hopes, the undeſerved and ſo often-forfeited hopes, of eternal glory? Lord, I am aſhamed to ſtand or to kneel, before thee. But pity me, I beſeech thee, and help me; for I am a pitiable object indeed! "My ſoul cleaveth unto the duſt," and lays itſelf as in the duſt before thee; but oh, <q>quicken me according to thy word Pſal. 119, 25!</q> Let me trifle no longer, for I am upon the brink of a precipice! I am <q>thinking of my ways, oh give me grace to turn my feet unto thy teſtimonies; to make haſte without any farther delay that I may keep thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments Pſal. 119, 59.60! Search me, O Lord, and try me Pſal. 139, 23!</q> Go to the firſt root of this diſtemper which ſpreads itſelf over my ſoul, and recover me from it! Repreſent ſin unto me, O Lord, I beſeech thee, that I may ſee it with abhorrence! and repreſent the Lord Jeſus Chriſt to me in ſuch a light, that I may "look upon him and mourn Zech. 12, 10," that I may look upon him and love! May I awaken from this ſtupid lethargy into which I am ſinking; and may Chriſt give me more abundant degrees of ſpiritual life and activity than I have ever yet received! And may I be ſo quickened and animated by him, that I may more than recover the ground I have loſt, and may
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:021060_0226_0FB29E4D4FB21100"/>
make a more ſpeedy and exemplary progreſs than in my beſt days I have ever yet done! Send down upon me, O Lord, in a more rich and abundant effuſion, thy good Spirit! May he dwell in me, as in a temple which he has conſecrated to himſelf 1 Cor. 3, 16; and while all the ſervice is directed and governed by him, may holy and acceptable ſacrifices be continually offered Rom. 12, 1!

               </argument>
               <p n="1">§ 1. THE declenſions which I have deſcribed in the foregoing chapter muſt be acknowledged worthy of deep lamentation: but happy will you be, my dear reader, if you never know, by experience, a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance yet more melancholy than this. Perhaps, when you conſider the view of things which you now have, you imagine that no conſiderations can ever bribe you, in any ſingle inſtance, to act contrary to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent dictates or ſuggeſtions of your conſcience, and of the Spirit of God as ſetting it on work. No; you think it would be better for you to die. And you think right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:021060_0227_0FB29E4EC9EB13E8"/>
But Peter thought and ſaid ſo too: <q>Though I ſhould die with thee, yet will I not deny thee Mat. 26, 35: and yet after all he fell; and therefore be not high minded, but fear Rom. 9, 20.</q> It is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but you may fall into that very ſin of which you imagine you are leaſt in danger, or into that againſt which you have moſt ſolemnly reſolved, and of which you have already moſt bitterly repented. You may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe into it again and again; but, oh, if you do, nay, if you ſhould deliberately and preſumptuouſly fall but once, Low deep will it pierce your heart; how dear will you pay for all the pleaſure with which the temptation has been baited? how will this ſeperate between God and you? What a deſolation, what a dreadful deſolation, will it ſpread over your ſoul! It is grievous to think of it. Perhaps in ſuch a ſtate you may feel more agony and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs in your own conſcience, when you come ſeriouſly to reflect, than you ever felt when you were firſt awakened and reclaimed; becauſe the ſin will be attended with ſome very high aggravations beyond thoſe of your unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſtate. I well knew the perſon that ſaid, <q>The a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonies of a ſinner in the firſt pangs of his repentance were not to be mentioned on the ſame day with thoſe of the backſlider in heart, when he comes to be filled with his own way Prov. 14, 14.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. Indeed it is enough to wound one's heart to think how your's will be wounded: how all your comforts, all your evidences, all your hopes, will be clouded; what thick darkneſs will ſpread itſelf on every ſide, ſo that neither ſun, nor moon, nor ſtars will appear in your heaven. Your ſpiritual conſolations will be gone; and your temporal enjoyments will alſo be rendered taſteleſs and inſipid. And if afflictions be ſent, as they probably may, in order to reclaim you, a conſciouſneſs of guilt will ſharpen and invenom the dart. Then will the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of your ſoul, with all his art and power, riſe up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, encouraged by your fall, and labouring to trample you down in utter hopeleſs ruin. He will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade you that you are already undone beyond recovery: he will ſuggeſt that it ſignifies nothing to attempt it any more; for that very effort, every amendment, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry act of repentance, will but make your caſe ſo much

the worſe, and plunge you lower and lower into hell.</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. Thus will he endeavour by terrors to keep you from that ſure remedy which yet remains. But yield not to him. Your caſe will indeed be ſad; and if it be now your caſe, it is deplorably ſo; and to reſt in it would be ſtill much worſe. Your heart would be hardened yet more and more; and nothing could be expected but ſudden and aggravated deſtruction. Yet, bleſſed be God, it is not quite hopeleſs. <q>Your wounds are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, becauſe of your fooliſhneſs Pſ. 38, 5;</q> but the gangrene is not incurable. <q>There is balm in Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead, there is a Phyſician there Jer. 8, 22.</q> Do not therefore, render your condition hopeleſs, by now ſaying, "There is no hope Jer. 2, 25," and drawing a fatal argument from that falſe ſuppoſition for going after the idols you have loved. Let me addreſs you in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of God to his backſliding people, when they were ready to apprehend that to be their caſe, and to draw ſuch a concluſion from it: <q>Only return unto me, ſaith the Lord Jer. 3, 1.13.</q> Cry for renewed grace; and, in the ſtrength of it, labour to return. Cry with David under the like guilt. <q>I have gone aſtray like a loſt ſheep, ſeek thy ſervant; for I do not forget thy commandment Pſ. 119, 176;</q> and that remembrance of them is, I hope, a token for good. But if thou wilt return at all, do it immediately. Take not one ſtep more in that fatal path to which thou haſt turned aſide. Think not to add one ſin more to the account, and then to repent; as if it would be but the ſame thing on the whole. The ſecond error may be worſe than the firſt; it may make way for another and another, and draw on a terrible train of conſequences beyond all you can now imagine. Make haſte, therefore, and do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay. Eſcape, and fly as for thy life Gen. 19, 17. before <q>the dart ſtrike through thy liver Prov. 7, 23. Give not ſleep to thine eyes, nor ſlumber to thine eye-lids Prov. 6, 4:</q> lye not down upon thy bed under un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardoned guilt, leſt evil overtake thee, leſt the ſword of divine juſtice ſhould ſmite thee; and whilſt thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeſt to return to-morrow, thou ſhouldſt this night go and take poſſeſſion of hell.</p>
               <p n="4">§ 4. Return immediately; and permit me to add,
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:021060_0229_0FB29E51D2301120"/>
return ſolemnly. Some very pious and excellent divines have expreſſed themſelves upon this head in a manner which ſeems liable to dangerous abuſe; when they urge men after a fall <q>not to ſtay to ſurvey the ground, nor conſider how they came to be thrown down, but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to get up and renew the race,</q> In ſlighter caſes the advice is good: but when conſcience has ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſuch violent outrage, by the commiſſion of known, wilful and deliberate ſin, (a caſe which one would hope ſhould but ſeldom happen to thoſe who have once ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entered on a religious courſe,) I can by no means think that either reaſon or Scripture encourage ſuch a method. Eſpecially would it be improper, if the action itſelf has been of ſo heinous a nature, that even to have fallen into it on the moſt ſudden ſurpriſe of temptation, muſt greatly have aſhamed, and terrified, and diſtreſſed the ſoul. Such an affair is dreadfully ſolemn, and ſhould be treated accordingly. If this has been the ſad caſe with you, my then unhappy reader, I would pity you, and mourn over you; and would beſeech you, as you tender your peace, your recovery, the health and the very life of your ſoul, that you would not loiter away an hour. Retire immediately for ſerious reflection. Break thro' other engagements and employments, unleſs they be ſuch as you cannot in conſcience delay for a few hours, which can ſeldom happen in the circumſtance I now ſuppoſe. This is the one thing needful. Set your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to it, therefore, as in the preſence of God, and hear at large patiently and humbly, what conſcience has to ſay, though it chide and reproach ſeverely. Yea, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly pray, that God would ſpeak to you by conſcience, and make you more thoroughly to know and feel <q>what an evil and bitter thing it is that you have thus for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken him Jer. 2, 19.</q> Think of all the aggravating circumſtances attending your offence, and eſpecially thoſe which ariſe from abuſed mercy and goodneſs; which ariſe not only from your ſolemn vows and engagements to God, but from the views you have had of a Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's love, ſealed even in blood. And are theſe the returns? Was it not enough that Chriſt ſhould have been <q>thus injured by his enemies? muſt he be wounded in the houſe of his friends, too Zech. 13, 6? Were
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:021060_0230_0FB29E53421F80B8"/>
delivered to work ſuch abominations as theſe Jer. 7, 10?</q> Did the bleſſed Jeſus groan and die for you, that you might ſin with boldneſs and freedom, that you might extract, as it were, the very ſpirit and eſſence of ſin, and offend God to a height of ingratitude and baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which would otherwiſe have been in the nature of things impoſſible! Oh, think how juſtly God might caſt you out from his preſence! How juſtly he might num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you among the moſt ſignal inſtances of his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance! And think how <q>your heart would endure, or your hands be ſtrong, if he would deal thus with you Ezek. 22, 14!</q> Alas! all your former experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies would enhance your ſenſe of the ruin and miſery that muſt be felt in an eternal baniſhment from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine preſence and favour.</p>
               <p n="5">§ 5. Indulge ſuch reflections as theſe. Stand the humbling ſight of your ſins in ſuch a view as this. The more odious and more painful it appears, the greater proſpect there will be of your benefit by attending to it. But the matter is not to reſt here. All theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections are intended, not to grieve, but to cure; and to grieve no more than promote the cure. You are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to look upon ſin; but you are alſo, in ſuch a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, if ever, to <q>look upon Chriſt: to look upon him whom you have now pierced" deeper than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and to mourn for him with ſincerity and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs Zech. 12, 10.</q>—The God whom you have injured and affronted, whoſe laws you have broken, and whoſe juſtice you have (as it were) challenged by this fooliſh wretched apoſtacy, is nevertheleſs <q>a moſt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful God Deut. 4, 31</q> You cannot be ſo ready to return to him, as he is ready to receive you. Even now does he, as it were, ſolicit a reconciliation by thoſe tender impreſſions which he is making upon your heart. But remember how he will be reconciled. It is in the very ſame way in which you made your firſt approaches to him; in the name, and for the ſake of his dear Son. Come, therefore, in an humble dependence upon him. Renew your application to Jeſus, that his blood may (as it were) be ſprinkled upon your ſoul, that your ſoul may thereby be purified, and your guilt removed. This very ſin of your's, which the bleſſed God foreſaw, increaſed the weight of your Redeemer's
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:021060_0231_0FB29E54C22F6320"/>
ſufferings: it was concerned in ſhedding his blood. Humbly go, and place your wounds (as it were) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the droppings of that precious balm by which alone they can be healed. That compaſſionate Saviour will delight to reſtore you, when you lye as an humble ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicant at his feet, and will graciouſly take part with you in that peace and pleaſure which he gives. Through him renew your covenant with God, that broken co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the breach of which divine juſtice might teach you to know <q>by terrible things in righteouſneſs Pſ. 65, 5;</q> but mercy allows of an accommodation. Let the conſciouſneſs and remembrance of the breach engage you to enter into a covenant a new, under a deeper ſenſe than ever of your own weakneſs, and a more cordial dependence on divine grace for your ſecurity, than you have ever yet entertained. I know you will be aſhamed to preſent yourſelf among the children of God in his ſanctuary, and eſpecially at his table, under a conſciouſneſs of ſo much guilt; but break through that ſhame, if Providence open you the way. You would be humbled before your of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended Father; but ſurely there is no place where you are more like to be humbled, than when you ſee your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in his houſe; and no ordinance adminiſtered there can lay you lower than that in which <q>Chriſt is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſet forth as crucified before your eyes Gal. 3, 1.</q> Sinners are the only perſons who have buſineſs there; the beſt of men come to that ſacred table as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; as ſuch make your approach to it; yea, as the greateſt of ſinners; as one who needs the blood of Jeſus as much as any creature upon earth.</p>
               <p n="6">§ 6. And let me remind you of one thing more: If your fall has been of ſuch a nature as to give any ſcandal to others, be not at all concerned to ſave appearances, and to moderate thoſe mortifications, which deep humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation before them would occaſion. The depth and pain of that mortification is indeed an excellent medicine, which God has in his wiſe goodneſs appointed for you in ſuch circumſtances as theſe. In ſuch a caſe, confeſs your fault with the greateſt frankneſs: aggravate it to the utmoſt; intreat pardon and prayer from thoſe whom you have offended. Then, and never till then, will you be in the way to peace: not by palliating a fault, not by
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:021060_0232_0FB29E5763CAFAA8"/>
making vain excuſes, not by objecting to the manner in which others may have treated you; as if the leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of rigour in a faithful admonition were a crime equal to ſome great immorality that occaſioned it. This can only proceed from the madneſs of pride and ſelf-love: it is the ſenſibility of a wound which is hardened, ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and enflamed! and it muſt be reduced and cooled, and ſuppled, before it can poſſibly be cured. To be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured and condemned by men, will be but a little griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to a ſoul thoroughly humbled and broken under a ſenſe of having incurred the condemning ſentence of God. Such a one will rather deſire to glorify God, by ſubmitting to deſerved blame; and will fear deceiving others into a more favourable opinion of him than he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly knows himſelf to deſerve. Theſe are the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which God gives to the ſincere penitent in ſuch a caſe; and by this means he reſtores him to that credit and regard among others, which he does not know how to ſeek; but which, nevertheleſs for the ſake both of his comfort and uſefulneſs, God wills that he ſhould have; and which it is, humanely ſpeaking, impoſſible for him to recover any other way. But there is ſomething ſo honorable in the frank acknowledgment of a fault, and in deep humiliation for it, that all who ſee it muſt needs approve it. They pity an offender who is brought to ſuch a diſpoſition, and endeavour to comfort him with returning expreſſions, not only of their love, but of their eſteem too.</p>
               <p n="7">§ 7. Excuſe this digreſſion, which may ſuit ſome caſes; and which would ſuit many more, if a regular diſcipline were to be exerciſed in churches: for on ſuch a ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, the Lord's ſupper could not be approached af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter viſible and ſcandalous falls without ſolemn confeſſion of the offence and declarations of repentance. On the other hand, there may be inſtances of ſad apoſtacy, where the crime, though highly aggravated before God, may not fall under human notice. In this caſe, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that your buſineſs is with him to whoſe piercing eye every thing appears in its juſt light; before him there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore proſtrate your ſouls and ſeek a ſolemn reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with him, confirmed by the memorials of his dying Son. And when this is done, imagine not, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:021060_0233_0FB29E594BD864F8"/>
you have received the tokens of pardon, the guilt of your apoſtacy is to be forgot at once. Bear it ſtill in your memory for future caution: lament it before God in the frequent returns of ſecret devotion eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and view with humiliation the ſcars of thoſe wounds which your own folly occaſioned, even when by divine grace they are thoroughly healed. For God eſtabliſhes his covenant not to remove the ſenſe of every paſt abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, but <q>that thou mayeſt remember thy ways, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more becauſe of thy ſhame, even when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou haſt done, ſaith the Lord Ezek. 16, 63.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="8">§ 8. And now, upon the whole, if you deſire to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch a temper, and to return by ſuch ſteps as theſe, then immediately fall down before God, and pour out your heart in his preſence, in language like this:</p>

                  <p>O Moſt holy, holy, holy, Lord God! when I ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly reflect on thy ſpotleſs purity, and on the ſtrict and impartial methods of thy ſteady adminiſtration, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with that almighty power of thine, which is able to carry every thought of thine heart into immediate and full execution, I may juſtly appear before thee this day with ſhame and terror, in confuſion and conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſpirit. This day, O my God, this dark mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful day, would I take occaſion to look back to that fad ſource of our guilt and our miſery, the apoſtacy of our common parents, and ſay, with thine offending ſervant David, "Behold, I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me Pſ. 51, 5." This day would I lament all the fatal conſequences of ſuch a deſcent with regard to myſelf. And, oh, how many have they been! —The remembrance of the ſins of my unconverted ſtate, and the failings and infirmities of my after life, may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confound me! How much more ſuch a ſcene as now lies before my conſcience, and before thine all ſeeing eye? For <q>thou, O Lord, knoweſt my fooliſhneſs, and my ſins are not hid from thee Pſ. 69, 5." Thou telleſt

How then ſhall I <q>appear in thy preſence, or lift up my face to thee Ez. 9, 6! I am full of confuſion Job. 10, 15.</q> and feel a ſecret regret in the thought of applying to thee: But, <q>O Lord, to whom ſhould I go but unto thee John 6, 68?</q> unto thee, on whom depends my life or my death: unto thee, who alone canſt take away that burthen of guilt which now preſſes me down to the duſt: who alone canſt reſtore to my ſoul that reſt and peace which I have loſt, and which I deſerve for ever to loſe!</p>
                  <p>Behold me, O Lord God, falling down at thy feet! Behold me, pleading guilty in thy preſence, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendering myſelf to that juſtice which I cannot eſcape! I have not one word to offer in my own vindication, in my own excuſe.

Thou, O Lord, and thou only, knoweſt to the full how heinous and how ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravated it is. Thine infinite underſtanding alone can fathom the infinite depth of its malignity.

I cannot conceive the glory of thy ſacred Majeſty, whoſe authority I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, nor the number and variety of thoſe mercies which I have ſinned againſt.

Oh the baſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and madneſs of my conduct! that I ſhould thus (as it were) rend open the wounds of my ſoul, of which I had died long ere this, had not thine own hand applied a remedy, had not thine only Son bled to prepare it!

                  <p>I wonder, O Lord God, that I am here to own all this. I wonder that thou haſt not long ago appeared "as a ſwift witneſs againſt me Mal. 3, 5:" that thou haſt not diſcharged the thunderbolts of thy flaming wrath againſt me, and cruſhed me into hell; making me there a terror to all about me, as well as to myſelf, by a vengeance and ruin, to be diſtinguiſhed even there, where all are miſerable, and all hopeleſs.</p>
                  <p>O God, thy patience is marvellous! but how much more marvellous is thy grace, which, after all this, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites me to thee! While I am here giving judgment againſt myſelf that I deſerve to die, to die for ever, thou art ſending me the words of everlaſting life, and <q>call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me, as a backſliding child, to return unto thee Jer. 3, 22.</q> Behold, therefore, O Lord, invited by thy word, and encouraged by thy grace, I come; and, great as my tranſgreſſions are, I humbly beſeech thee freely to pardon them; becauſe I know, that though my <q>ſins have reached unto heaven Rev. 18, 5. and are lifted up even to the ſkies Jer. 51, 9. thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, O Lord, is above the heavens Pſ. 108, 4.</q> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend thy mercy to me, O heavenly Father; and diſplay, in this illuſtrious inſtance, the riches of thy grace, and the prevalency of thy Son's blood!

And may this <q>joy of the Lord be my ſtrength Neh. 8, 10.</q> ſo that in it I may ſerve thee henceforward with a vigor and zeal far beyond what I have hitherto known!</p>
                  <p>This I would aſk, with all humble ſubmiſſion to thy will; for I preſume not to inſiſt upon it. If thou ſhouldſt ſee fit to make me a warning to others, by appointing that I ſhould walk all my days in darkneſs, and at laſt die under a cloud, "thy will be done!" But, O God, extend mercy for thy Son's ſake, to this ſinful ſoul at laſt; and give me ſome place, though it were at the feet of all thine other ſervants, in the regions of glory! Oh bring me at length, though it ſhould be through the gloomieſt valley that any have ever paſſed, into that bleſſed world where I ſhall depart from God no more! where I ſhall wound my own conſcience and diſhonour thy holy name no more!

               <head>CHAP. XXIV. The Caſe of the Chriſtian under the Hidings of God's Face.</head>
               <argument>
                  <p>The phraſe ſcriptural, § <hi>1.</hi> It ſignifies the withdrawing the tokens of the divine favour, § <hi>2.;</hi> chiefly as to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual conſiderations, § <hi>3.</hi> This may become the caſe of any Chriſtian, § <hi>4.;</hi> and will be found a very ſorrowful one, § <hi>5.:</hi> The following directions, therefore, are given to thoſe who ſuppoſe it to be their own:—<hi>I.</hi> To inquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be indeed a caſe of ſpiritual diſtreſs, or whether a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſolate frame may not proceed from indiſpoſition of body, §. <hi>6.:</hi> or difficulties as to worldly circumſtances, § <hi>7.</hi> If it be found to be indeed ſuch as the title of the chapter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, be adviſed, <hi>II.</hi> To conſider it as a merciful diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of God, to awaken and beſtir the ſoul, and excite it to a ſtrict examination of conſcience and reformation of what has been amiſs, § <hi>8, 9, III.</hi> To be humble and patient while the trial continues, § <hi>10.

V.</hi> To renew a believing application to the blood of Jeſus, § <hi>12.</hi> An humble ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication for one under thoſe mournful exerciſes of mind, when they are found to proceed from the ſpiritual cauſe ſuppoſed.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§ 1. THERE is a caſe which often occurs in the Chriſtian life, which they who accuſtom them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much to the exerciſe of devotion, have been uſed to call <hi>hidings of God's face.</hi> It is a phraſe borrowed from the word of God, which I hope may ſhelter it from contempt at the firſt hearing. It will be my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this chapter to ſtate it as plainly as I can, and then to give ſome advices as to your own conduct when you fall into it, as it is very probable you may, before you have finiſhed your journey through this wilderneſs.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. The meaning of it may partly be underſtood by the oppoſite phraſe, of <hi>God's cauſing his face to ſhine</hi> upon a perſon, or <hi>lifting upon him the light of his countenance.</hi> This ſeems to carry in it an alluſion to the pleaſant and delightful appearance which the face of a friend has, and eſpecially if, in a ſuperior relation of life, when he
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:021060_0238_0FB29E690D79A948"/>
converſes with thoſe whom he loves and delights in. Thus Job, when ſpeaking of the regard paid him by his attendants, ſays, <q>If I ſmiled upon them, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved it not, and the light of my countenance they caſt not down Job. 29, 24;</q> that is, they were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, in ſuch an agreeable circumſtance, to do nothing to diſpleaſe me, or (as we ſpeak) to cloud my brow. And David, when expreſſing his deſire of the manifeſtation of Gods favour to him, ſays, <q>Lord lift thou up the light of thy reconciled countenance upon me;</q> and, as the effect of it, declares, <q>thou haſt put gladneſs in my heart more than if corn and wine increaſed Pſal. 4, 6.7.</q> Nor is it impoſſible that, in this phraſe, as uſed by David, there may be ſome alluſion to the bright ſhining forth of the Shechinah, that is, the lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtre which dwelt in the cloud as the viſible ſign of the divine preſence with Iſrael, which God was pleaſed pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly to manifeſt upon ſome public occaſions, as a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of his favour and acceptance.—On the other hand, therefore, for God to hide his face, muſt imply the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the tokens of his favour, and muſt be eſteemed a mark of his diſpleaſure. Thus <hi>Iſaiah</hi> uſes it: <q>Your iniquities have ſeparated between you and your God, and your ſins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear Iſa. 59, 2." And again, "Thou haſt hid thy face from us,</q> as not regarding the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we ſuffer, <q>and haſt conſumed us, becauſe of our iniquities Iſa. 64, 7. So likewiſe for God to hide his face from our ſins Pſ. 51, 9. ſignifies to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look them, and to take no farther notice of them.</q> The ſame idea is, at other times, expreſſed by <q>God's hiding his eyes Iſa. 1, 15.</q> from perſons of a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter diſagreeable to him, when they come to addreſs him with their petitions, not vouchſafeing (as it were) to look towards them. This is plainly the ſcriptural ſenſe of the word; and agreeably to this, it is generally uſed by Chriſtians in our day, and every thing which ſeems a token of divine diſpleaſure towards them is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by it.</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. It is farther to be obſerved here, that the things which they judge to be manifeſtations of divine favour towards them, or complacency in them, are not only,
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:021060_0239_0FB29E6A86DBC0A8"/>
nor chiefly, of a temporal nature, or ſuch as merely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the bleſſings of this animal and periſhing life. David, though the promiſes of the law had a continual reference to ſuch, yet was taught to look farther, and deſcribes them as preferable to, and therefore plainly diſtinct from <q>the bleſſings of the corn-floor, or the wine preſs Pſ. 4, 7.</q> And if you, to whom I am now addreſſing, do not know them to be ſo, it is plain you are quite ignorant of the ſubject we are enquiring into, and indeed are yet to take out the firſt leſſons of true religion. All that David ſays of <q>beholding the beauty of the Lord Pſ. 27, 4. or being ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſs, when he remembered him upon his bed Pſ. 63, 5, 6." as well as with the goodneſs of his houſe, even of his holy temple Pſ. 65, 4.</q> is to be taken in the ſame ſenſe, and can need very little explication to the truly experienced ſoul. But thoſe that have known the light of God's counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and the ſhinings of his face, will, in proportion to the degree of that knowledge, be able to form ſome notion of the hiding of his face, or the withdrawing of the tokens he has given his people of his preſence and favour, which ſometimes greatly imbitters proſperity; as where the contrary is found, it ſweetens afflictions, and often ſwallows up the ſenſe of it.</p>
               <p n="4">§ 4. And give me leave to remind you, my Chriſtian friend (for under that character I now addreſs my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) that to be thus deprived of the ſenſe of God's love, and of the tokens of his favour, may ſoon be the caſe with you, though you may now have the pleaſure to ſee "the candle of the Lord ſhining upon you," or though it may even ſeem to be ſunſhine and high noon in your ſoul. You may loſe your lively views of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine perfections and glories, in the contemplation of which you now find that inward ſatisfaction. You may think of the divine wiſdom and power, of the divine mercy and fidelity, as well as of his righteouſneſs and holineſs, and feel little inward complacency of ſoul in the view; it may be, with reſpect to any lively im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as if it were the contemplation merely of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon object. It may ſeem to you as if you bad loſt all idea to thoſe important words, though the view had
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:021060_0240_0FB29E6C03AA7230"/>
ſometimes ſwallowed up your whole ſoul in tranſports of admiration, aſtoniſhment and love. You may loſe your delightful ſenſe of the divine favour. It may be matter of great and ſad doubt with you, whether you do indeed belong to God; and all the work of his bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirit may be ſo vailed and ſhaded in the ſoul, that the peculiar characters by which the hand of that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Agent might be diſtinguiſhed, ſhall be in a great meaſure loſt; and you may be ready to imagine you had only deluded yourſelf in all the former hopes you have entertained. In conſequence of this, thoſe ordinances, in which you now rejoice, may grow very uncomfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to you, even when you do indeed deſire communion with God in them. You may hear the moſt delightful evangelical truths opened, you may hear the privileges of God's children moſt affectionately repreſented, and not be aware that you have any part or lot in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and from that coldneſs and inſenſibility, may be drawing a farther argument, that you have nothing to do with them. And then your heart may meditate terror Iſ. 33, 18; and under the diſtreſs that overwhelms you, your deareſt enjoyments may be reflected upon as adding to the weight of it, and making it more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, while you conſider that you had once ſuch a taſte for theſe things, and have now loſt it all. So that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may ſeem to you, that they who never felt any thing at all of religious impreſſions, are happier than you, or at leaſt are leſs miſerable. You may perhaps, in theſe melancholy hours, even doubt whether you have ever prayed at all; and whether all that you called your enjoyment of God were not ſome falſe delights, excited by the great enemy of ſouls, to make you apprehend that your ſtate was good, that ſo you might continue his more ſecure prey.</p>
               <p n="5">§ 5. Such as this may be your caſe for a conſiderable time; and ordinances may be attended in vain, and the preſence of God may be in vain ſought in them. You may pour out your ſoul in private, and then come to public worſhip, and find little ſatisfaction in either; but be forced to take up the Pſalmiſt's complaint; <q>My God, I cry in the day-time, but thou heareſt not; and in the night-ſeaſon, and am not ſilent Pſal. 22, 2;</q>
                  <pb n="228" facs="unknown:021060_0241_0FB29E6D822ED298"/>
or that of Job, <q>Behold, I go forward, but he is not there, and backward, but I cannot perceive him; on the left hand where he doth work, but I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him; he hideth himſelf on the right hand that I cannot ſee him Job. 23, 9:</q> So that all which look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like religion in your mind ſhall ſeem, as it were, to be melted into grief, or chilled into fear, or cruſhed into a deep ſenſe of your own unworthineſs; in conſequence of which, you ſhall not dare ſo much as to lift up your eyes before God, and be almoſt aſhamed to take your place in a worſhipping aſſembly among any that you think his ſervants. I have known this to be the caſe of ſome excellent Chriſtians, whoſe improvements in religion have been diſtinguiſhed, and whom God hath honoured above many of their brethren in what he hath done for them, and by them. Give me leave, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, having thus deſcribed it, to offer you ſome plain advices with regard to it; and let not that be imputed to enthuſiaſtic fancy which proceeds from an intimate and frequent view of facts on the one hand, and from a ſincere affectionate deſire on the other, to relieve the tender pious heart in ſo deſolate a ſtate. At leaſt, I am perſuaded the attempt will not be overlooked or diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by <q>the great Shepherd of the Sheep Heb. 13, 20. who hath charged us to comfort the feeble minded 1 Theſſ. 5, 14.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="6">§ 6. And here I would firſt adviſe you moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to inquire whether your preſent diſtreſs does indeed ariſe from cauſes which are truly ſpiritual; or whether it may not rather have its foundation in ſome diſorder of body, or in the circumſtances of life, in which you are providentially placed, which may break your ſpirits, and deject your mind? The influence of the inferior part of our nature on the nobler, the immortal ſpirit, while we continue in this imbodied ſtate, is ſo evident, that no attentive perſon can, in the general, fail to have obſerved it; and yet theſe are caſes in which it ſeems not to be ſufficiently conſidered; and perhaps your own may be one of them. The ſtate of the blood is often ſuch as neceſſarily to ſuggeſt gloomy ideas even in dreams, and to indiſpoſe the ſoul for taking pleaſure in any thing: and when it is ſo, why ſhould it be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:021060_0242_0FB29E709F02EB48"/>
to proceed from any peculiar divine diſpleaſure, if it does not find its uſual delight in religion? or why ſhould God be thought to have departed from us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſuffers natural cauſes to produce natural ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, without oppoſing by miracle to break the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion? When this is the caſe, the help of the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian is to be ſought rather than that of the divine, or, at leaſt, by all means, together with it; and medicine, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, exerciſe, and air, may, in a few weeks, effect that which the ſtrongeſt reaſonings, the moſt pathetic exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations or conſolations, might for many months have attempted in vain.</p>
               <p n="7">§ 7. In other inſtances, the dejection and feebleneſs of the mind may ariſe from ſomething uncomfortable in our worldly circumſtances; theſe may cloud as well as diſtract the thoughts, and embitter the temper, and thus render us in a great degree unfit for religious ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices or pleaſures; and when it is ſo, the remedy is to be ſought in ſubmiſſion to divine Providence; in ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting our affections, as far as poſſible, from the preſent world; in a prudent care to eaſe ourſelves of the burden, ſo far as we can, by moderating unneceſſary expences, and by diligent application to buſineſs in hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble dependence on the divine bleſſing; in the mean time, endeavouring by faith to look up to him, who ſometimes ſuffers his children to be brought into ſuch difficulties, that he may endear himſelf more ſenſibly to them by the method he ſhall take for their relief.</p>
               <p n="8">§ 8. On the principles here laid down, it may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps appear, on enquiry, that the diſtreſs complained of may have a foundation very different from what was at firſt ſuppoſed. But where the health is found, and the circumſtances eaſy; when the animal ſpirits are diſpoſed for gaiety and entertainment, while all taſte for religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous pleaſure is in a manner gone; when the foul is ſeized with a kind of lethargic inſenſibility, or, what I had almoſt called a paralytic weakneſs, with reſpect to every religious exerciſe, even though there ſhould not be that deep terryfying diſtreſs, or pungent amazement, which I before repreſented as the effect of melancholy; nor that anxiety about the accommodations of life, which ſtrait circumſtances naturally produce: I would in that
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:021060_0243_0FB29E7200C10610"/>
caſe vary my advice, and urge you, with all poſſible attention and impartiality, to ſearch into the cauſe which has brought upon you that great evil, under which you juſtly mourn. And probably, in the general, the cauſe is ſin; ſome ſecret ſin, which has not been diſcovered or obſerved by the eye of the world; for enormities that draw on them the obſervation and cenſure of others, will probably fall under the caſe mentioned in the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er chapter, as they muſt be inſtances of known and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate guilt. Now, the eye of God hath ſeen theſe evils which have eſcaped the notice of your fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and, in conſequence of this care to conceal them from others, while you could not but know they were open to him, God has ſeen himſelf in a peculiar manner affronted and injured, I had almoſt ſaid, inſulted, by them; and hence his righteous diſpleaſure. Oh! let that never be forgotten, which is ſo plainly ſaid, ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly known, ſo familiar to almoſt every religious ear, yet too little felt by any of our hearts. <q>Your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iquities have ſeparated between you and your God, and your ſins have hid his face from you that he will not hear Iſa. 59, 1, 2.</q> And this is, on the whole, a merciful diſpenſation of God, though it may ſeem ſevere; regard it not, therefore, merely as your cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, but as intended to awaken you, that you may not content yourſelf even with lying in tears of humiliation before the Lord, but, like Joſhua, riſe and exert your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf vigorouſly to put away from you that accurſed thing, whatever it be. Let this be your immediate and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt care that your pride may be humbled, that your watchfulneſs may be maintained, that your affections to the world may be deade<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ed, and that, on the whole, your fitneſs for heaven may in every reſpect be increaſed. Theſe are the deſigns of your heavenly Father, and let it be your great concern to co-operate with them.</p>
               <p n="9">§ 9. Receive it therefore, on the whole, as the moſt important advice that can be given you, <q>immediately to enter on a ſtrict examination of your conſcience.</q> —Attend to its gentleſt whiſpers. If a ſuſpicion ariſes in your mind that any thing has not been right, trace that ſuſpicion, ſearch into every ſecret folding of your heart, improve to the purpoſes of a fuller diſcovery,
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:021060_0244_0FB29E7BF39F7828"/>
the advices of your friends, the reproaches of your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: recollect for what your heart hath ſmitten you at the table of the Lord; for what it would ſmite you if you were upon a dying bed, and within this hour to enter on eternity. When you have made any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, note it down, and go on in your ſearch till you can ſay, Theſe are the remaining corruptions of my heart; theſe are the ſins and follies of my life; this have I neglected; this have I done amiſs. And when the account is as complete as you can make it, ſet your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in the ſtrength of God, to a ſtrenuous reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or rather begin the reformation of every thing that ſeems amiſs as ſoon as ever you diſcover it; <q>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Almighty, and thou ſhalt be built up, and put iniquity far from thy tabernacle; then ſhalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and ſhalt lift up thy face unto God. Thou ſhalt make thy prayer unto him, and he ſhall hear thee; thou ſhalt pay thy vows unto him, and his light ſhall ſhine upon thy ways Job. 22, 23<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="10">§ 10. In the mean time, be waiting for God with the deepeſt humility, and ſubmit yourſelf to the diſcip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line of your heavenly Father, acknowledging his juſtice, and hoping in his mercy; even when your conſcience is leaſt ſevere in its remonſtrances, and diſcovers nothing more than the common infirmities of God's people; yet ſtill bow yourſelf down before him, and own, that ſo many are the evils of your beſt days, ſo many the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of your beſt ſervices, that by them you have deſerved all, and more than all, that you ſuffer: de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, not only that your ſun ſhould be clouded, but that it ſhould go down, and ariſe no more, but leave your ſoul in a ſtate of everlaſting darkneſs. And while the ſhade continues, be not impatient. Fret not your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in any wiſe, but rather with a holy calmneſs and gentleneſs of ſoul, "wait on the Lord Pſ. 37, 8.34." Be willing to ſtay his time, willing to bear his frown, in humble hope that he will at length "return and have compaſſion on you Jer. 12, 15." He <q>has not utterly forgotten to be gracious, nor "reſolved that he will be favourable no more Pſ. 77, 7.9.—For the Lord will not caſt off for ever; but though he cauſe grief,
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:021060_0245_0FB29E7D43FC5320"/>
yet will he have compaſſion according to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his mercies Lam. 3, 31.32. It is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively but for a ſmall moment that he hides his face from you; but you may humbly hope, that with great mercies he will gather you, and that with everlaſting kindneſs he will have mercy on you Iſa. 54, 7.8.</q> Theſe ſuitable words are not mine, but his; and they wear this as in the very front of them, <q>That a ſoul under the hidings of God's face may at leaſt be one whom he will gather, and to whom he will extend everlaſting favour.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="11">§ 11. But while the darkneſs continues, <q>go on in the way of your duty.</q> Continue the uſe of means and ordinances: read, and meditate: pray, yea, and ſing the praiſes of God too, though it may be with a heavy heart. Follow <q>the footſteps of his flock Cant. 1, 8; you may perhaps meet the Shepherd of ſouls</q> in doing it. Place yourſelf at leaſt in his way. It is poſſible you may by this means get a kind look from him; and one look, one turn of thought, which may happen in a moment, may, as it were, create a heaven in your ſoul at once. Go to the table of the Lord. If you cannot rejoice, go and mourn there. <q>Go and mourn that Saviour, whom by your ſins you have pierced Zech. 12, 10;</q> go and lament the breaches of that covenant, which you have there ſo often confirmed. Chriſt may perhaps <q>make himſelf known unto you in the breaking of bread Luke 24, 35,</q> and you may find, to your ſurpriſe, that he hath been near you, when you imagined he was at the greateſt diſtance from you; near you when you thought you were caſt out from his preſence. Seek your comfort in ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments as theſe, and not in the vain amuſements of this world, and in the pleaſures of ſenſe. I ſhall never forget that affectionate expreſſion, which I am well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured broke out from an eminently pious heart, then al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ready to break under the ſorrows of this kind: <q>Lord, if I may not enjoy thee, let me enjoy nothing elſe; but go down mourning after thee to the grave!</q> I wondered not to hear, that almoſt as ſoon as this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent had been breathed out before God in prayer, the burden was taken off, and the joy of God's ſalvation reſtored.</p>

I ſhall add but one advice more, and that is, <q>That you renew your application to the blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, through whom the reconciliation between God and your ſoul has been accompliſhed.</q> It is he that is our peace and by his blood it is that we are made nigh Eph. 2, 13.14; it is in him, as the Beloved of his ſoul, that God declares he is well pleaſed Matth. 3, 17; and it is in him that we are made accepted, to the glory of his grace Eph. 1, 6. Go therefore, O Chriſtian, and apply by faith to a crucified Saviour: go, and apply to him as to a merciful High Prieſt <q>and pour out thy complaint before him, and ſhow before him thy trouble Pſ. 142, 2.</q> Lay open the diſtreſs and anguiſh of thy ſoul to him, who once knew what it was to ſay, (O aſtoniſhing! that he of all others ſhould ever have ſaid it,) "My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me Matth. 27, 46?" Look up for pity and relief to him, who himſelf ſuffered, being not only tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but with regard to ſenſible manifeſtations, deſerted, that he might thus know how to pity thoſe that are in ſuch a melancholy caſe, and be ready, as well as <q>able, to ſuccour them Heb. 2, 18. He is, Emmanuel, God with us Matth. 1, 23;</q> and it is only in and through him that his Father ſhines forth upon us with the mildeſt beams of mercy and of love. Let it be therefore your immediate care to renew your acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with him. Review the records of his life and death: hear his words: behold his actions: and when you do ſo, ſurely you will find a ſecret ſweetneſs diffuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing itſelf over your ſoul. You will be brought into a calm, gentle, ſilent frame, in which faith and love will operate powerfully, and God may probably cauſe the ſtill ſmall voice of his comforting Spirit to be heard 1 Kings 19, 12. till your ſoul burſts out into a ſong of praiſe, and you may be <q>made glad, according to the days in which you have been afflicted Pſ. 90, 15.</q> In the mean time, ſuch language as the following ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication ſpeaks may be ſuitable.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Here it is adviſed, <hi>(1.)</hi> That afflictions ſhould be expected, § <hi>1. (2.)</hi> That the righteous hand of God ſhould be
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:021060_0250_0FB20E031EF95628"/>
acknowledged in them when they come, § <hi>2. (3.)</hi> That they ſhould be borne with patience, § <hi>3. (4.)</hi> That the divine conduct in them ſhould be cordially approved, § <hi>4. (5.)</hi> That thankfulneſs ſhould be maintained in the midſt of trials, § <hi>5. (6.)</hi> That the deſign of afflictions ſhould be diligently inquired into, and all proper aſſiſtance taken in diſcovering it, § <hi>6. (7.)</hi> That when it is diſcovered, it ſhould humbly be complied with and anſwered, § <hi>7.</hi> A prayer ſuited to ſuch a caſe.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§ 1. SINCE <q>man is born unto trouble as the ſparks fly upward Job. 5, 7.</q> and Adam has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed on all his race the ſad inheritance of calamity in their way to death, it will certainly be prudent and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that we ſhould all expect to meet with trials and afflictions; and that you, reader, whoever you are, ſhould be endeavouring to gird on your armour, and put yourſelf into a poſture to encounter thoſe trials which will fall to your lot as a man, and a Chriſtian. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare yourſelf to receive your afflictions, and to endure them, in a manner agreeable to both thoſe characters. In this view, when you ſee others under the burden, conſider how poſſible it is that you may be called out to the very ſame difficulties, or to others equal to them. Put your ſoul as in the place of theirs. Think how you could endure the load under which they lie; and endeavour at once to comfort them, and to ſtrengthen your own heart; or rather, pray that God would do it. And obſerving how liable mortal life is to ſuch ſorrows, moderate your expectations from it; raiſe your thoughts above it; and form your ſchemes of happineſs only for that world where they cannot be diſappointed: in the mean time, bleſſing God, that your proſperity is length<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened out this far, and aſcribing it to his ſpecial provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that you continue ſo long unwounded, when ſo many ſhowers of arrows are flying around you, and ſo many are falling by them on the right hand and on the left.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. When at length your turn comes, as it certainly will, from the firſt hour in which an affliction ſeizes you, realize to yourſelf the hand of God in it, and loſe not the view of him in any ſecond cauſe, which may
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:021060_0251_0FB20E04DEB8A3A8"/>
have proved the immediate occaſion. Let it be your firſt care <q>to humble yourſelf under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time 1 Pet. 5, 6.</q> Own, that <q>he is juſt in all that is brought upon you. Neh. 9, 33." and "that in all theſe things he puniſhes you leſs than your iniquities deſerve Ezra 9, 13.</q> Compoſe yourſelf to bear his hand with patience, to glorify his name by a ſubmiſſion to his will, and to fall in with the gracious deſign of this viſitation, as well as to wait the iſſue of it quietly, whatever the event may be.</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. Now that <q>patience may have its perfect work James 1, 4.</q> reflect frequently and deeply upon your own meanneſs and ſinfulneſs. Conſider how often every mercy has been forfeited, and every judgment deſerved. And conſider too, how long the patience of God hath borne with you, and how wonderfully it is ſtill exerted towards you; and, indeed, not only his patience, but his bounty too. Afflicted as you are, (for I ſpeak to you now as actually under the preſſure,) look round and ſurvey your remaining mercies, and be gratefully ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of them. Make the ſuppoſition of their being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: what if God ſhould ſtretch out his hand againſt you, and add poverty to pain, or pain to poverty, or the loſs of friends to both; or the death of ſurviving friends to that of thoſe who you are now mourning over; would not the wound be more grievous? Adore his goodneſs that this is not the caſe: and take heed, leſt your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankfulneſs ſhould provoke him to multiply your ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. Conſider alſo the need you have of diſcipline; how wholeſome it may prove to your ſoul, and what merciful deſigns our heavenly Father has in all the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections he ſends upon his children.</p>
               <p n="4">§ 4. Nay, I will add, that, in conſequence of all theſe conſiderations, it may well be expected, not only that you ſhould ſubmit to your afflictions, as what you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not avoid, but that you ſhould ſweetly acquieſce in them, approve them; that you ſhould not only juſtify, but glorify God, in ſending them; that you ſhould glorify him with your heart, and with your lips too. Think not praiſe unſuitable on ſuch an occaſion; nor think that praiſe alone to be ſuitable which takes its riſe from
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:021060_0252_0FB20E06D7CB81C8"/>
remaining comforts: but know that it is your duty, not only to be thankful in your afflictions, but to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful on account of them.</p>
               <p n="5">§ 5. God himſelf has ſaid, <q>In every thing give thanks 1 Theſſ. 5, 18; and he has taught his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to ſay, Yea alſo we glory in tribulation Rom. 5, 3.</q> And moſt certain it is, that to true believers they are inſtances of divine mercy; for <q>whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every ſon whom he receiveth</q> with peculiar and diſtinguiſhing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearment Heb. 12, 6. View your preſent afflictions in this light as chaſtiſements of love; and then let your own heart ſay, whether love does not demand praiſe. Think with yourſelf, it is thus that God is making me conformable to his own Son; it is thus that he is training me up for complete glory. Thus he kills my corruptions; thus he ſtrengthens my graces; thus he is wiſely contriving to bring me nearer to himſelf, and to ripen me for the honours of his heavenly kingdom. It is <q>if need be, that I am in heavineſs 1 Pet. 1, 6;</q> and he ſurely knows what that need is better than I can pretend to teach him; and knows what peculiar propriety there is in this affliction to anſwer my preſent neceſſity, and do me that peculiar good which he is gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly intending me by it. <q>This tribulation ſhall work patience, and patience experience and experience a more aſſured hope; even a hope which ſhall not make aſhamed, while the love of God is ſhed abroad in my heart Rom. 5, 3.4.5.</q> and ſhines through my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction like the ſun through a gently-deſcending cloud, darting in light upon the ſhade, and mingling fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with weeping.</p>
               <p n="6">§ 6. Let it be then your earneſt care, while you thus look on your affliction, whatever it maybe, as coming from the hand of God, to improve it to the purpoſes for which it was ſent. And that you may ſo improve it, let it be your firſt concern to know what thoſe purpoſes are. Summon up all the attention of your ſoul to <q>hear the rod, and him who hath appointed it Mic. 6, 9;</q> and pray earneſtly that you may underſtand its voice. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine your life, your words, and your heart; and pray,
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:021060_0253_0FB20E0A878A3CA0"/>
that God would ſo guide your inquiries, that you may "return unto the Lord that ſmiteth you Iſa. 9, 13." To aſſiſt you in this call in the help of pious friends, and particularly of your miniſters: intreat not only their prayers, but their advices too, as to the probable deſign of Providence; and encourage them freely to tell you any thing which occurs to their minds upon this head. And if ſuch an occaſion ſhould lead them to touch upon ſome of the imperfections of your character and conduct, look upon it as a great token of their friendſhip, and take it not only patiently but thankfully. It does but ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Chriſtian at any time to reſent reproofs and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, and leaſt of all does it become him when the rebukes of his heavenly Father are upon him: he ought rather to ſeek admonitions at ſuch a time as this, and voluntarily to offer his wounds to be ſearched by a faithful and ſkilful hand.</p>
               <p n="7">§ 7. And when, by one means or another, you have got a ray of light to direct you in the meaning and language of ſuch diſpenſations, take heed that you do not in any degree, "harden yourſelf againſt God, and walk contrary to him Lev. 26, 27." Obſtinate reluctance to the apprehended deſign of any providential ſtroke is inexpreſſibly provoking to him. Set yourſelf therefore to an immediate reformation of whatever you diſcover amiſs; and labour to learn the general leſſons of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſubmiſſion to God's will, of a more calm indifference to the world, and of a cloſer attachment to divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and to the views of an approaching inviſible ſtate. And whatever particular proportion or correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence you may obſerve between this or that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance in your affliction and your former tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, be eſpecially careful to act according to that more peculiar and expreſs voice of the rod. Then you may perhaps have ſpeedy and remarkable reaſon to ſay, that <q>it hath been good for you, that you have been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Pſ. 119, 71;</q> and, with a multitude of others, may learn to number the times of your ſharpeſt trials, among the ſweeteſt and the moſt exalted moments of your life. For this purpoſe, let prayer be your frequent employment; and let ſuch ſentiments as theſe, if not in the very ſame terms, be often and affectionately poured out before God.</p>

                  <p>O THOU ſupreme, yet all righteous and gracious Governor of the whole univerſe! Mean and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable as this little province of thy ſpacious em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire may appear, thou doſt not diſregard the earth and its inhabitants; but attendeſt to its concerns with the moſt condeſcending and gracious regards. <q>Thou reigneſt, and I rejoice in it," as it is indeed "mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of univerſal joy Pſ. 97, 1.</q> I believe thy uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal providence and care; and I firmly believe thy wiſe, holy, and kind interpoſition in every thing which relates to me, and to the circumſtances of my abode in this thy world. I would look through all inferior cauſes unto thee, whoſe eyes are upon all thy creatures; to thee <q>who formeſt the light, and createſt darkneſs, who makeſt peace, and createſt evil Iſa. 14, 7;</q> to thee, Lord, who, at thy pleaſure, canſt exchange the one for the other, canſt turn the brighteſt noon into midnight, and the darkeſt midnight into noon.</p>
                  <p>O thou wiſe and merciful Governor of the world! I have often ſaid "Thy will be done:" and now thy will is painful to me. But ſhall I, upon that account, unſay what I have ſo often ſaid? God forbid! I come rather to lay myſelf down at thy feet, and to declare my full and free ſubmiſſion to all thy ſacred pleaſure. O Lord, thou art juſt and righteous in all! I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, in thy venerable and awful preſence, that I have deſerved this, and ten thouſand times more Ezra 9, 13; I acknowledge, that "it is of thy mercy that I am not utterly conſumed Lam. 3, 22," and that any the leaſt degree of comfort yet remains. O Lord, I moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily confeſs, that the ſins of one day of my life have merited all theſe chaſtiſements; and that every day of my life hath been more or leſs ſinful. Smite, therefore, O thou righteous Judge! and I will ſtill adore thee, that inſtead of the ſcourge, thou haſt not given a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the ſword, to do all the dreadful work of juſtice, and to pour out my blood in thy preſence.</p>
                  <p>But ſhall I ſpeak unto thee only as my Judge? O Lord, thou haſt taught me a tender name: thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcendeſt
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:021060_0255_0FB20E0CDA1137C0"/>
to call thyſelf my Father, and to ſpeak of correction as the effect of thy love. O welcome wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, thoſe afflictions which are the tokens of thy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal affection, the marks of my adoption into thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily! Thou knoweſt what diſcipline I need, thou ſeeſt, O Lord, that bundle of folly which there is in the heart of thy poor froward and thoughtleſs child; and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt what rods, and what ſtrokes, are needful to drive it away. I would therefore, <q>be in humble ſubjection to the Father of ſpirits, who chaſteneth me for my profit; would be in ſubjection to him, and live Heb. 12, 9.10.</q> I would bear thy ſtrokes, not merely becauſe I cannot reſiſt them, but becauſe I love and truſt in thee. I would ſweetly acquieſce and reſt in thy will, as well as ſtoop to it; and would ſay, <q>Good is the word of the Lord 2 Kings 20, 19.</q> And I deſire, that not only my lips but my ſoul may acquieſce. Yea, Lord, I would praiſe thee, that thou wilt ſhow ſo much regard to me as to apply ſuch remedies as theſe to the diſeaſes of my mind, and art thus kindly careful to train me up for glory. I have no objections againſt being afflicted, againſt being afflicted in this particular way: <q>T'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Only be pleaſed, O Lord, to ſtand by me, and ſometimes to grant me a favourable look in the midſt of my ſufferings! ſupport my ſoul, I beſeech thee, by thy conſolations mingled with my tribulations; and I ſhall glory in thoſe tribulations that are thus allayed! It has been the experience of many who have reflected on afflicted days with pleaſure, and have acknowledged that their comforts have ſwallowed up their ſorrows. And after all that thou haſt done, <q>are thy mercies reſtrained Iſa. 63, 15?</q> "Is thy hand waxed ſhort Numb. 11, 23?" or canſt thou not ſtill do the ſame for me?</p>

I am much more concerned that my afflictions may be ſanctified than that they may be removed. Number me, O God, among the <q>happy perſons, whom whilſt thou chaſteneſt, thou teacheſt out of thy law Pſ. 114, 12!</q> Show me, I beſeech thee, "wherefore thou contendeſt with me Job. 10, 2;" and purify me by the fire, which is ſo painful to me while I am paſſing through it! Doſt thou not <q>chaſten thy children for this very end, that they may be partakers of thine holineſs Heb. 12, 10!</q> Thou knoweſt, O God, it is this my ſoul is breathing after. I am partaker of thy bounty every day and moment of my life; I am partaker of thy goſpel, and, I hope, in ſome meaſure too, a partaker of the grace of it operat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on my heart: Oh may it operate more and more, that I may largely partake of thine holineſs too; that I may come nearer and nearer in the temper of my mind to thee, O bleſſed God, the ſupreme model of perfection! let my ſoul be (as it were) melted, though with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſeſt heat of the furnace, if I may but thereby be made fit for being delivered into the mold of thy goſpel, and bearing thy bright and amiable image!</p>

               </argument>
               <p n="1">§ 1. IF by divine grace, you have been <q>born again, not of corruptible ſeed, but of incorruptible 1 Pet. 1, 23. even by that word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever,</q> not only in the world, and in the church, but in particular ſouls in which it is ſown; you will, <q>as new-born babes, deſire the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere milk of the word, that you may grow thereby 1 Pet. 2, 2.</q> And though, in the moſt advanced ſtate of religion on earth, we are but infants in compariſon of what we hope to be, when in the heavenly world we arrive <q>unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fullneſs of Chriſt Eph. 4, 13;</q> yet, as we have ſome exerciſe of a ſanctified reaſon, we ſhall be ſolicitous that we may be growing and thriving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. And you, my reader, if <q>ſo be that you have taſted that the Lord is gracious 1 Pet. 2, 3.</q> will, I doubt not, feel this ſolicitude. I would therefore endeavour to aſſiſt you in making the inquiry, whether religion be on the advance in your ſouls. And here I ſhall warn you againſt ſome falſe marks of growth;
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:021060_0258_0FB20E145B092098"/>
and then ſhall endeavour to lay down others on which you may depend as more ſolid.—In this view, I would obſerve, that you are not to meaſure your growth in grace only, or chiefly, by your advances in knowledge, or in zeal, or any other paſſionate impreſſion of the mind; no, nor by the fervor of devotion alone; but by the habitual determination of the will for God, and by your prevailing diſpoſition to obey his commands, to ſubmit to his diſpoſals, and to ſubſerve his ſchemes in the world.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. It muſt be allowed, that knowledge and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in religion are indeed deſirable. Without ſome degree of the former, religion cannot be rational; and it is very reaſonable to believe, that without ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the latter it cannot be ſincere, in creatures whoſe natures are conſtituted like ours. Yet there may be a great deal of ſpeculative knowledge, and a great deal of rapturous affection, where there is no true religion at all; and therefore much more, where there is no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced ſtate in it.—The exerciſe of our rational facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties upon the evidences of divine revelation, and upon the declaration of it as continued in ſcripture, may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh a very wicked man with a well digeſted body of orthodox divinity in his head, when not one ſingle doctrine of it has ever reached his heart. An eloquent deſcription of the ſufferings of Chriſt, of the ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of judgment, of the joys of the bleſſed, and the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries of the damned, might move the breaſt even of a man who did not firmly believe them; as we often find ourſelves ſtrongly moved by well-wrought narrations, or diſcourſes, which, at the ſame time, we know to have their foundation in fiction. Natural conſtitution, or ſuch accidental cauſes as are, ſome of them, too low to be here mentioned, may ſupply the eyes with a flood of tears, which may diſcharge itſelf plenteouſly upon almoſt any occaſion that ſhall firſt ariſe. And a proud impatience of contradiction, directly oppoſite as it is to the gentle ſpirit of Chriſtianity, may make a man's blood boil when he hears the notions he has entertained, and eſpecially thoſe which he has openly and vigorouſly eſpouſed, diſputed and oppoſed. This may poſſibly lead him, in terms of ſtrong indignation, to pour out his
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:021060_0259_0FB20E15E66C9028"/>
zeal and his rage before God in a fond conceit, that, as the God of truth, he is the patron of thoſe favourite doctrines, by whoſe fair appearances perhaps he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is miſled—And if theſe ſpeculative refinements, or theſe affectionate ſallies of the mind, be conſiſtent with a total abſence of true religion, they are much more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently conſiſtent with a very low eſtate of it. I would deſire to lead you, my friend, into ſublimer notions and juſter marks; and refer you to other practical writers, and, above all, to the book of God, to prove how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial they are. I would therefore intreat you to bring your own heart to anſwer, as in the preſence of God, to ſuch inquiries as theſe:</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. Do you find <q>divine love, on the whole, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing in your ſoul?</q>—Do you feel yourſelf more and more ſenſible of the preſence of God? and does that ſenſe grew more delightful to you than it formerly was? Can you, even when your natural ſpirits are weak and low, and you are not in any frame for the ardors and ecſtacies of devotion, nevertheleſs find a pleaſing reſt, a calm repoſe of heart, in the thought that God is near you, and that he ſees the ſecret ſentiments of your ſoul, while you are, as it were labouring up the hill, and caſting a longing eye towards him, though you cannot ſay you enjoy any ſenſible communications from him? Is it agreeable to you to open your heart to his inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and regard? to preſent it to him laid bare of every diſguiſe, and to ſay with David, <q>Thou, Lord, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thy ſervant 2 Sam. 7, 20?</q> Do you find a growing eſteem and approbation of that ſacred law of God, which is the tranſcript of his moral perfections? Do you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly <q>eſteem all his precepts concerning all things to be right Pſal. 119, 128?</q> Do you diſcern, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the neceſſity, but the reaſonableneſs, the beauty the pleaſure, of obedience; and feel a growing ſcorn and contempt for thoſe things which may be offered as the price of your innocence, and would tempt you to ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice or to hazard your intereſt in the divine favour and friendſhip? Do you not find an ingenuous deſire to pleaſe God, not only becauſe he is ſo powerful, and has ſo many good and ſo many evil things entirely at his command, but from a veneration of his moſt amiable
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:021060_0260_0FB20E175CB6F7A8"/>
nature and character; and do you find your heart habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually reconciled to a moſt humble ſubjection, both to his commanding and to his diſpoſing will? Do you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that your own will is now more ready and diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every circumſtance, to bear the yoke, and to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the divine determination, whatever he appoints to be borne or forborne? Can you <q>in patience poſſeſs your ſoul Luke 21, 19?</q> Can you maintain a more ſteady calmneſs and ſerenity when God is ſtriking at your deareſt enjoyments in this world, and acting moſt directly contrary to your preſent intereſts, to your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural paſſions and deſires? If you can, it is a moſt certain and noble ſign that grace is grown up in you to a very vigourous ſtate.</p>
               <p n="4">§ 4. Examine alſo, "what effections you find in your heart towards thoſe who are round about you, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the reſt of mankind in general."—Do you find your heart overflow with undiſſembled and unreſtrained benevolence? Are you more ſenſible than you once were of thoſe many endearing bonds which unite all men, and eſpecially all Chriſtians, into one community; which make them brethren and fellow-citizens? Do all the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly paſſions die and wither in your ſoul, while the kind ſocial affections grow and ſtrengthen? And though ſelf-love was never the reigning paſſion ſince you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a true Chriſtian, yet as ſome remainders of it are ſtill too ready to work inwardly, and to ſhow themſelves, eſpecially as ſudden occaſions ariſe, do you perceive that you get ground of them? Do you think of yourſelf only as one of a great number, whoſe particular intereſts and concerns are of little importance when compared with thoſe of the community, and ought by all means, on all occaſions, to be ſacrificed to them?</p>
               <p n="5">§ 5. Reflect eſpecially "on the temper of your mind towards thoſe whom an unſanctified heart might be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to imagine it had ſome juſt excuſe for excepting out of the liſt of thoſe it loves, and towards whom you are ready to feel a ſecret averſion, or at leaſt an alienation from them."—How does your mind ſtand affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thoſe who differ from you in their religious ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and practices? I do not ſay that Chriſtian chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will require you to think every error harmleſs. It
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:021060_0261_0FB20E19A5ECB998"/>
argues no want of love to a friend in ſome caſes to fear leaſt his diſorder ſhould prove more fatal than he ſeems to imagine; nay, ſometimes the very tenderneſs of friendſhip may increaſe that apprehenſion. But to hate perſons becauſe we think they are miſtaken, and to ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate every difference in judgment or practice, into a fatal and damnable error, that deſtroys all Chriſtian communion and love, is a ſymptom generally much worſe than the evil it condemns. Do you love the image of Chriſt in a perſon who thinks himſelf obliged in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to profeſs and worſhip in a manner different from yourſelf? Nay farther, can you love and honour that which is truly amiable and excellent in thoſe in whom much is defective: in thoſe in whom there is a mixture of bigotry and narrowneſs of ſpirit, which may lead them perhaps to ſlight, or even to cenſure, you? Can you love them as the diſciples and ſervants of Chriſt, who, through a miſtaken zeal, may be ready to <q>caſt out your name as evil Luke 6, 22.</q> to warn others againſt you as a dangerous perſon? This is none of the leaſt triumphs of charity, nor any deſpicable evidence of an advance in religion.</p>
               <p n="6">§ 6. And, on this head, reflect farther, <q>how can you bear injuries?</q>—There is a certain hardneſs of ſoul in this reſpect, which argues a confirmed ſtate in piety and virtue. Does every thing of this kind hurry and ruffle you, ſo as to put you on contrivances how you may recompenſe, or, at leaſt, how you may diſgrace and expoſe him who has done you the wrong? or can you ſtand the ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

put the kindeſt conſtruction upon the offence, to excuſe it as far as reaſon will allow, and (where, after all, it will wear a black and odious aſpect) to forgive it, heartily to forgive it, and that even before any ſubmiſſion is made or pardon aſked; and in token of the ſincerity of that forgiveneſs, to be contriving what can be done by ſome benefit or other toward the injurious perſon to teach him a better temper.</p>
               <p n="7">§ 7. Examine farther "with regard to the other evils and calamities of life, and even with regard, to its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties, how can you bear them?"—Do you find your ſoul is in this reſpect gathering ſtrength? Have you fewer foreboding fears and diſquieting alarms than you once had as to what may happen in life? Can you truſt the wiſdom and goodneſs of God to order your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs for you with more complacency and chearfulneſs than formerly? Do you find you are unable to unite your thoughts more in ſurveying preſent circumſtances, that you may collect immediate duty from them, though you know not what God will next appoint or call you to? And when you feel the ſmart of affliction, do you make a leſs matter of it? can you transfer your heart more eaſily to heavenly and divine objects, without an anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſolicitude, whether this or that burthen be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſo it may be but ſanctified to promote your commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God; and your ripeneſs for glory?</p>
               <p n="8">§ 8. Examine alſo, "whether you advance in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity."—This is a ſilent, but moſt excellent grace; and they who are moſt eminent in it, are deareſt to God, and moſt fit for the communications of his preſence to them. Do you then feel your mind more emptied of proud and haughty imaginations; not prone ſo much to look back upon paſt ſervices which it has performed, as forward to thoſe which are yet before you, and inward upon the remaining imperfections of your heart? Do you more tenderly obſerve your daily ſlips and miſcarriages, and find yourſelf diſpoſed to mourn over thoſe things before the Lord that once paſſed with you as ſlight mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; though when you come to ſurvey them as in the preſence of God, you find they were not wholly invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, or free from guilt? Do you feel in your breaſt a deeper apprehenſion of the infinite majeſty of the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

God, and of the glory of his natural and moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; ſo as, in conſequence of thoſe views, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive yourſelf (as it were) annihilated in his preſence, and to ſhrink into <q>leſs than nothing and vanity Iſa. 40, 17?</q> If this be your temper, God will look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you with peculiar favour, and will viſit you more and more with the diſtinguiſhed bleſſings of his grace.</p>
               <p n="9">§ 9. But there is another great branch and effect of Chriſtian humility, which it would be an unpardonable negligence to omit. Let me, therefore, farther enquire, Are you more frequently renewing your application, your ſincere, ſteady, determinate application, to the righteouſneſs and blood of Chriſt, as being ſenſible how unworthy you are to appear before God otherwiſe than in him? And do the remaining corruptions of your heart humble you before him, though the diſorders of your life are in a great meaſure cured? Are you more earneſt to obtain the quickening influences of the Holy Spirit? and have you ſuch a ſenſe of your own weakneſs, as to engage you to depend in all the duties you perform up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the communications of his grace to <q>help your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities Rom. 8, 26?</q> Can you, at the cloſe of your moſt religious, exemplary, and uſeful days, bluſh before God for the deficiencies of them, while others perhaps may be ready to admire and extol your conduct? And while you give the glory of all that has been right to him from whom the ſtrength and grace has been derived, are you coming to the blood of ſprinkling to free you from the guilt which mingles itſelf even with the beſt of your ſervices? Do you learn to receive the bounties of Providence, not only with thankfulneſs as coming from God, but with a mixture of ſhame and confuſion too, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a conſciouſneſs that you do not deſerve them, and are continually forfeiting them? And do you juſtify Providence in your afflictions and diſappointments, even while many are flouriſhing around you in the full bloom of proſperity, whoſe offences have been more viſible at leaſt, and more notorious than yours?</p>
               <p n="10">§ 10. Do you alſo advance in <q>zeal and activity for the ſervice of God, and the happineſs of mankind?</q> Does your love ſhew itſelf ſolid and ſincere, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual flow of good works from it? Can you view the

ſorrows of others with tender compaſſion, and with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and contrivances what you may do to relieve them? Do you feel in your breaſt that you are more frequently "deviſing liberal things Iſa. 32." and ready to weave your own advantage or pleaſure that you may accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh them? Do you find your imagination teeming (as it were) with conceptions and ſchemes for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the cauſe and intereſt of Chriſt in the world, for the propogation of his goſpel, and for the happineſs of your fellow-creatures? And do you not only pray, but act for it; act in ſuch a manner as to ſhew that you pray in earneſt; and feel a readineſs to do what little you can in this cauſe, even though others, who might, if they pleaſed, very conveniently do a vaſt deal more, will do nothing?</p>
               <p n="11">§ 11. And not to enlarge on this copious head, reflect once more, how your affections ſtand with regard to this world and another?"—Are you more deeply and practically convinced of the vanity of theſe <q>things which are ſeen and are temporal 2 Cor. 4, 18?</q> Do you perceive your expectations from them, and your at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments to them, to diminiſh? You are willing to ſtay in this world as long as your Father pleaſes, and it is right and well; but do you find your bonds ſo looſened to it, that you are willing, heartily willing, to leave it at the ſhorteſt warning; ſo that if God ſhould ſee fit to ſummon you away on a ſudden, though it ſhould be in the midſt of your enjoyments, purſuits, expectations, and hopes, you would cordially conſent to that remove; without ſaying, Lord, let me ſtay a little while longer to enjoy this or that agreeable entertainment, to finiſh this or that ſcheme? Can you think with an habitual calmneſs, and hearty approbation, if ſuch be the divine pleaſure, of walking no more when you lie down on your bed, of returning home no more when you go out of your houſe? And yet, on the other hand, how great ſoever the burthens of life are, do you find a willingneſs to bear them, in ſubmiſſion to the will of your heavenly Father, though it ſhould be to many future years; and though they ſhould be years of far greater affliction than you have ever yet ſeen?

Reflect on thoſe remarkable circumſtances in providence, which occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the knitting of ſome bonds of this kind, which, next to thoſe which join your ſoul to God, you number among the happieſt. And forget not, in how many inſtances, when theſe dear lives have been threatened, lives perhaps more ſenſibly dear than your own, God hath given them back from the borders of the grave, and ſo added new endearments ariſing from that tender circumſtance to all your after converſe with them. Nor forget, in how gracious a manner he hath ſupported ſome others in their laſt moments, and enabled them to live behind a ſweet odour of piety, which hath embalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their memories revived you when ready to faint un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſorrows of the firſt ſeparation, and, on the whole, made even the recollection of their death de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful.</p>

This God ſaw, and he pitied you; and being merciful to you, he provided in the counſels of his eternal love and grace, a Redeemer for you, and purchaſed you to himſelf with the blood of his Son; a price, which, if you will pauſe upon it, and think ſeriouſly what it was, muſt ſurely affect you to ſuch a degree as to make you fall down before God in wonder and ſhame, to think it ſhould ever have been given for you. To accompliſh theſe bleſt purpoſes, he ſent his grace into your heart; ſo that, though <q>you were once darkneſs, you are now light in the Lord Eph. 5, 8.</q> He made that happy change which you now feel in your ſoul, and by his Holy Spirit which is given to you, he ſhed abroad that principle of love Rom. 5, 5, which is enkindled by this review, and now flames with greater ardor than before. Thus far he hath ſupported you in your Chriſtian courſe; and, <q>having obtained help from him, it is that you continue even to this day Acts 26, 22.</q> He hath not only bleſſed you, but made you a bleſſing Gen. 12, 2: and though you have not been ſo uſeful as that holy generoſity of heart, which he has excited, would have engaged you to deſire, yet ſome good you have done in the ſtation in which he has fixed you. Some of your brethren of mankind has been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, perhaps, too, ſome thoughtleſs creature reclaimed to virtue and happineſs, by his bleſſing on our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. Some in the way to heaven are praiſing God for you; and ſome, perhaps, already there are long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for your arrival, that they may thank you in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler and more expreſſive forms for benefits, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of which they now ſufficiently underſtand, though while here they could never conceive it.</p>

Think of thoſe now unknown tranſports with which thou ſhalt drop every burthen in the grave, and thine immortal ſpirit ſhall mount, light and joyful, holy and happy, to God, its original, its ſupport, and its hope to God; the ſource of being, of holineſs, and of pleaſure;

to Jeſus, through whom all theſe mercies are derived to thee, and who will appoint thee a throne near his own, to be for ever the ſpectator and partaker of his glory. Think of the rapture with which thou ſhalt attend his triumph in the reſurrection day, and receive this poor mouldering corruptible body, transformed into his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious image; and then think, "theſe hopes are not mine alone, but the hopes of thouſands and millions. Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, whom I number among the deareſt of my friends upon earth, are rejoicing with me in theſe apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and views: and God gives me ſometimes to ſee the ſmiles on their cheeks, the ſweet humble hope that ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles in their eyes, and ſhines through the tears of tender gratitude; and to hear that little of their inward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency and joy which language can expreſs. Yea, and multitudes more, who were once equally dear to me with theſe, though I have laid them in the grave, and wept over their duſt, are living to God, living in the poſſeſſion of inconceivable delights, and drinking large draughts of the water of life, which flows in perpetual ſtreams at his right hand."</p>

                  <p>And now, O my God, what ſhall I ſay unto thee! What, but that I love thee above all the powers of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to expreſs!

                  <p>A ſincere love to God will expreſs itſelf, not only in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, but in benevolence to men, § <hi>1, 2.</hi> This is the command of God, § <hi>3.</hi> The true Chriſtian feels his ſoul wrought to a holy conformity to it, § <hi>4.</hi> and therefore will deſire inſtructions on this head, § <hi>5.</hi> Accordingly directions are given for the improvement of various talents: parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, <hi>(1.)</hi> Genius and learning, § <hi>6.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">§ 1. SUCH as I have deſcribed in the former chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I truſt are, and will be, the frequent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of your ſouls before God. Thus will your love and gratitude breathe itſelf forth in the divine preſence, and will, through Jeſus the great Mediator, come up before it as incenſe, and yield an acceptable ſavour. But then you muſt remember, this will not be the only effect of that love to God, which I have ſuppoſed ſo warm in your heart. If it be ſincere, it will not ſpend itſelf in words alone; but will diſcover itſelf in actions, and will produce, as its genuine fruit, an unfeigned love to your fellow creatures, and an unwearied deſire and labour to do them good continually.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. "Has the great Father of mercies," will you ſay, "looked upon me with ſo gracious an eye; has he not only forgiven me ten thouſand offences, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched me with ſuch a variety of benefits; oh! what ſhall I render to him for them all! Inſtruct me, O ye oracles of eternal truth! inſtruct me, ye elder brethren in the family of my heavenly Father! inſtruct me above all, O thou Spirit of wiſdom and of love, what I may be able to do to expreſs my love to the great eternal fountain of love, and to approve my fidelity to him,

who has already done ſo much to engage it, and who will take ſo much pleaſure in owning and rewarding it!"</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. This, O Chriſtian, <q>is the command which we have heard from the beginning,</q> and it will ever continue in unimpaired force, <q>that he who loveth God, ſhould love his brother alſo John 4, 21;</q> and ſhould expreſs that love, <q>not in word and profeſſion alone, but in deed and in truth John 3, 28.</q> You are to <q>love your neighbour as yourſelf; to love the whole creation of God;</q> and, ſo far as your influence can extend, muſt endeavour to make it happy.</p>
               <p n="4">§ 4. "Yes," will you ſay, "and I do love it. I feel the golden chain of the divine love incircling us all, and binding us cloſe to each other, joining us in one body; and diffuſing, as it were, one ſoul through all. May happineſs, true and ſublime, perpetual and evergrowing happineſs, reign through the whole world of God's ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional and obedient creatures in heaven and on earth! And may every revolted creature, that is capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing recovered and reſtored, be made obedient: Yea, may the neceſſary puniſhment of thoſe who are irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable, be over-ruled by infinite wiſdom and love, to the good of the whole!"</p>
               <p n="5">§ 5. Theſe are right ſentiments; and if they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the ſentiments of your heart, O reader, and not an empty form of vain words, they will be attended with a ſerious concern to act in ſubordination to this great ſcheme of divine Providence, according to your abilities in their utmoſt extent.

But, oh, how ſeldom is this eſtimate faithfully made! and how much does the world around us, and how much do our own ſouls ſuffer, for want of that fidelity!</p>
               <p n="6">§ 6. Hath God given you genius and learning? It was not that you might amuſe or deck yourſelf with it, and kindle a blaze which ſhould only ſerve to attract and dazzle the eyes of men; it was intended to be the means of leading both yourſelf and them to the Father of lights. And it will be your duty, according to the peculiar turn of that genius and capacity, either to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to improve and adorn human life, or, by a more direct application of it to divine ſubjects, to plead the cauſe of religion, to defend its truths, to enforce and recommend its practice, to deter men from courſes which would be diſhonourable to God and fatal to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to try the utmoſt efforts of all the ſolemnity and tenderneſs with which you can clothe your addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, to lead them into the paths of virtue and of happineſs.</p>
               <p n="7">§ 7. Has God inveſted you with power, whether it be in a larger or ſmaller ſociety? Remember, that this power was given you that God might be honoured, and thoſe placed under your government, whether domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic or public, might be made happy. Be concerned therefore, whether you be entruſted with the rod, or the ſword, it may "not be borne in vain Rom. 13, 4."

Have you the charge of executing laws; put life into them by a vigorous and ſtrenuous execution, according to the nature of the particular office you bear. Retain not an empty name of authority. Permit not yourſelf, as

Break in pieces the power of the oppreſſor. Unvail every diſhoneſt art. Diſgrace, as well as defeat, the wretch, that makes his diſtinguiſhed abilities the diſguiſe or protection of the wickedneſs which he ought rather to endeavour to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and to drive out of the world with abhorrence.</p>
               <p n="8">§ 8. Are you placed only at the head of a private fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily? Rule it for God. Adminiſter the concerns of that little kingdom with the ſame views, and for the ſame principles, which I have been inculcating on the powerful and the great; if by an unexpected accident any of them ſhould ſuffer their eyes to glance upon the paſſage above. Your children and ſervants are your natural ſubjects. Let good order be eſtabliſhed among them and keep them under a regular diſcipline. Let them be inſtructed in the principles of religion, that they may know how reaſonable ſuch a diſcipline is; and let them be accuſtomed to act accordingly. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indeed change their hearts, but you may very much influence their conduct; and by that means may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them from many ſnares, may do a great deal to make them good members of ſociety, and may <q>ſet them as it were, in the way of God's ſteps Pſ. 85, 13.</q> if peradventure paſſing by he may bleſs them with the riches of his grace.

               <p n="9">§ 9. Again, has God been pleaſed to raiſe you to eſteem among your fellow-creatures, which is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in proportion to a man's rank or poſſeſſions in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life?

If your character has any weight in the world, throw it into the right ſcale. Endeavour to keep virtue and goodneſs in countenance. Affectionately give your hand to modeſt worth, where it ſeems to be depreſſed or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked, though ſhining, when viewed in its proper light, with a luſtre which you may think much ſuperior to your own. Be an advocate for truth; be a counſellor of peace; be an example of candour; and do all you can to reconcile the hearts of men, and eſpecially of good men, to each other, however they may differ in their opinions about matters which it is poſſible for good men to diſpute. And let the caution and humility of your behaviour in circumſtances of ſuch ſuperior eminence, and amidſt ſo many tokens of general eſteem, ſilently reprove the raſhneſs and haughtineſs of thoſe who, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, are remarkable for little elſe; or who, if their abilities were indeed conſiderable, muſt be deſpiſed, and whoſe talents muſt be in a great meaſure loſt to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, till that raſhneſs and haughtineſs of ſpirit be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued. Nor ſuffer yourſelf to be interrupted in this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and worthy courſe by the little attacks of envy and calumny which you may meet with in it. Be ſtill attentive to the general good, and ſteadily reſolute in your efforts to promote it; and leave it to Providence to guard or to reſcue your character from the baſe aſſaults of malice and falſehold; which will often, without your labour, confute themſelves, and heap upon the authors greater ſhame, or (if they are inacceſſible to that) great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er infamy, than your humanity will allow you to wiſh them.</p>
               <p n="10">§ 10. Once more: Has God bleſſed you with riches? has he placed you in ſuch circumſtances that you have more than you abſolutely need for the ſubſiſtance of yourſelf and your family? Remember your approaching account. Remember what an incumbrance theſe things often prove to men in the way of their ſalvation, and how often, according to our Lord's expreſs declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they render it <q>as difficult to enter into the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom

of God, as it is for a camel to go through the eye of a needle Matth. 19, 24.</q> Let it therefore be your immediate, your earneſt, and your daily prayer, that riches may not be a ſnare and a ſhame to you, as they are to by far the greater part of their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors. Appropriate, I beſeech you, ſome certain part and proportion of your eſtate and revenues to charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble uſes; with a proviſional increaſe, as God ſhall proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per you, in any extraordinary inſtance. By this means you will always have a fund of charity at hand: and you will probably be more ready to communicate, when you look upon what is ſo depoſited as not in any ſenſe your own, but as already actually given away to thoſe uſes, though not yet affixed to particular objects. It is not for me to ſay what that proportion ought to be, To thoſe who have large revenues and no children, perhaps a third and one half may be too little: to thoſe whoſe incomes are ſmall, and their charge con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, though they have ſomething more than is abſolutely neceſſary, it is poſſible a tenth may be too much. But pray that God would guide your mind; make a trial for one year, on ſuch terms as in your conſcience you think will be moſt pleaſing to him; and let your obſervations on that teach you to fix your proportion for the next; always remembering that he requires juſtice in the firſt place, and almſdeeds only ſo far as may conſiſt with that. Yet, at the ſame time, take heed of that treacherous, deluſive, and, in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, deſtructive imagination, that juſtice to your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily requires that you ſhould leave your children very rich; which has, perhaps, coſt ſome parſimonious par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents the lives of thoſe darlings for whom they laid up the portion of the poor; and what fatal conſequences of divine diſpleaſure may attend it to thoſe that yet ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive, God only knows; and I heartily pray that you or your's may never learn by experience.</p>
               <p n="11">§ 11. And that your heart may be yet more opened, and that your charity may be directed to the beſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, let me briefly mention a variety of good uſes, which may call for the conſideration of thoſe whom God has in this reſpect diſtinguiſhed by an ability to do good, To aſſiſt the hints I am to offer, look round in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:021060_0282_0FB20E46B12C2E38"/>
in which you live. Think how many honeſt and induſtrious, perhaps too, I might add, religious people are making very hard ſhifts to ſtruggle through life. Think what a comfort that would be to them, which you might without any inconvenience ſpare from that abundance which God has given you.—Hearken alſo to any extraordinary call of charity which may happen, eſpecially thoſe of a public nature; and help them forward with your example and your intereſt, which, perhaps, may be of much greater importance than the ſum which you contribute, conſidered in itſelf. Have a tongue to plead for the neceſſitous, as well as a hand to relieve them; and endeavour to diſcounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance thoſe poor ſhameful excuſes which covetouſneſs often dictates to thoſe whoſe art may indeed ſet ſome varniſh on what they ſuggeſt, but ſo ſlight a one, that the coarſe ground will appear through it.—See how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny poor children are wandering naked and ignorant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ſtreets, and in the way to all kinds of vice and miſery; and conſider what can be done towards clothing ſome of them at leaſt, and inſtructing them in the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of religion. Would every thriving family in a town, which is able to afford help on ſuch occaſions, caſt a pitying eye on one poor family in its neighbourhood, and take it under their patronage, to aſſiſt in feeding, and clothing, and teaching the children, in ſupporting it in affliction, in defending it from wrongs, and in adviſing thoſe that have the management of it, as circumſtances may require, how great a difference would ſoon be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the appearance of things amongſt us?—Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve who are ſick, that if there be no public infirmary at hand to which you can introduce them, (where your contribution will yield the largeſt increaſe,) you may do ſomething towards relieving them at home, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them with advice and medicines, as well as with proper diet and attendance. Conſider alſo the ſpiritual neceſſities of men; in providing for which, I would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly recommend to you the very important and noble charity of aſſiſting young perſons of genius and piety with what is neceſſary to ſupport the expence of their education of the miniſtry, in a proper courſe of grammatical or academical ſtudies. And grudge not
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:021060_0283_0FB20E482AE5DB78"/>
ſome proportion of what God hath given you to thoſe who, reſigning all temporal views to miniſter to you the goſpel of Chriſt, have ſurely an equitable claim to be ſupported by you, in a capacity of rendering you thoſe ſervices, however laborious, to which, for your ſakes, and that of your common Lord, they have devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their lives. And while you are ſo abundantly <q>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with the goodneſs of God's houſe, even of his holy temple Pſal. 65.4,</q> have compaſſion on thoſe who dwell in a deſert land; and rejoice to do ſomething to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſending among the diſtant nations of the heathen world that glorious goſpel which hath ſo long continued unknown to multitudes, though the knowledge of it, with becoming regard, to life everlaſting.—Theſe are a few important charities, which I would point out to thoſe whom Providence has enriched with its peculiar boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and it renders gold more precious than it could appear in any other light, that it is capable of being em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for ſuch purpoſes. But if you ſhould not have gold to ſpare for them, contribute your ſilver; or, as a farthing or a mite, is not overlooked by God when it is given from a truely generous and charitable heart Mark 12, 42.43, let that be chearfully dropped into the treaſury where richer offerings cannot be afforded.</p>
               <p n="12">§ 12. And that, amidſt ſo many preſſing demands for charity, you may be better furniſhed to anſwer them, ſeriouſly reflect on your manner of living. I ſay not that God requires you ſhould become one of the many poor relieved out of your income. The ſupport of ſociety, as at preſent eſtabliſhed, will not only permit, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire that ſome perſons ſhould allow themſelves in the elegance and delights of life; by furniſhing which, mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of poor families are much more creditably and comfortably ſubſiſted, with greater advantage to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſafety to the public, than they could be if the price of their labours, or of the commodities in which they deal, were to be given them as an alms; nor can I imagine it greatful to God that his gifts ſhould be refuſed, as if they were meant for ſnares and curſes, rather than benefits. This were to fruſtrate the benevolent purpoſes of the gracious Father of mankind, and, if carried to its rigor, would be a ſort of conſpiracy againſt the whole
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:021060_0284_0FB20E49B5EDFFF0"/>
ſyſtem of nature. Let the bounties of providence be uſed; but let us carefully ſee to it that it be in a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and prudent manner, leſt, by our own folly that which ſhould have been for our welfare, become a trap Pſal. 69, 22. Let conſcience ſay, my dear reader, with regard to yourſelf, what proportion of the good things you poſſeſs, your heavenly Father intends for yourſelf, and what for your brethren; and live not as if you had no brethren, as if pleaſing yourſelf in all the magnificence and luxury you can deviſe, were the end for which you were ſent into the world. I fear this is the exceſs of the preſent age, and not an exceſs of rigor and mortification. Examine therefore your expences, and compare them with your income. That may be ſhamefully extravagant in you, which may not only be pardonable, but commendable in another of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior eſtate. Nor can you be ſure that you do not exceed, merely becauſe you do not plunge yourſelf in debt, nor render yourſelf incapable of laying up any thing for your family. If you be diſabled from doing any thing for the poor, or any thing proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your rank in life, by that genteel and elegant way of living which affect, God muſt diſapprove of ſuch a conduct; and you ought, as you will anſwer it to him, to retrench it. And though the divine indulgence will undoubtedly be exerciſed to thoſe in whom there is a ſincere principle of faith in Chriſt, and undiſembled love to God and man, though it act not to that height of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence and uſefulneſs which might have been attained; yet be aſſured of this, that he who rendereth to every one according to his works, will have a ſtrict regard to the degrees of goodneſs in the diſtribution of final re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards: ſo that every neglected opportunity draws af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it an irreparable loſs, which will go into eternity along with you. And let me add, too, that every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of negligence indulged renders the mind ſtill more and more indolent and weak, and, conſequently, more indiſpoſed to recover the ground which has been loſt or even to maintain that which has hitherto been kept.</p>
               <p n="13">§ 13. Complain not, that this is impoſing hard things upon you. I am only directing your pleaſures into a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler channel; and indeed that frugality, which is the

ſource of ſuch a generoſity, far from being at all injurious to your reputation, will rather amongſt wiſe and good men, greatly promote it. But you have far nobler mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives before you than thoſe which ariſe from their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards. I ſpeak to you as to a child of God, and a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Chriſt; as joined therefore by the moſt intimate union to all the pooreſt of thoſe that believe in him. I ſpeak to you as to an heir of eternal glory, who ought therefore to have ſentiments great and ſublime in ſome proportion to that expected inheritance.</p>
               <p n="14">§ 14. Caſt about therefore in your thoughts what good is to be done, and what you can do, either in your own perſon, or by your intereſt with others; and go about it with reſolution, as in the name and preſence of the Lord.

               <argument>
                  <p>Death and Judgment are near; but the Chriſtian has rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to welcome both, § <hi>1.</hi> Yet nature recoils from the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of them, § <hi>2.</hi> An attempt to reconcile the mind, <hi>[I.]</hi> To the proſpect of death, § <hi>3.</hi> from the conſideration, <hi>(1.)</hi> Of the many evils that ſurround us in that mortal life, § <hi>4. (2.)</hi> Of the remainder of ſin which we feel within us, <hi>5.</hi> And, <hi>(3.)</hi> Of the happineſs which is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to ſucceed death, § <hi>6, 7.</hi> All which might make the Chriſtian willing to die, in the moſt agreeable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of human life, <hi>8. [II.]</hi> The Chriſtian has reaſon to rejoice in the proſpect of judgment, § <hi>9.</hi> Since, however awful it be, Chriſt will then come to vindicate his honour, to diſplay his glory, and to triumph over his enemies, § <hi>10.</hi> As alſo to complete the happineſs of every believer, § <hi>11.</hi> and of the whole church, § <hi>12. 13.</hi> The meditation of a Chriſtian, whoſe heart is warm with theſe proſpects.</p>
               </argument>
               <p n="1">§ 1. WHEN the viſions of the Lord were cloſing upon John, the beloved diſciple in the iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of Patmos, it is obſervable, that he who gave him that revelation, even Jeſus, the faithful and true witneſs concludes with thoſe lively and important words: <q>He who teſtifieth theſe things, ſaith, Surely I come quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</q> and John anſwers, with the greateſt readineſs and pleaſure, <q>Amen, even ſo come, Lord Jeſus Rev. 22, 20.</q> Come as thou haſt ſaid, ſurely, and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly!—And remember, O Chriſtian, whoever you are, now reading theſe words, your divine Lord ſpeaks in the ſame language to you: "Behold I come quickly." Yes, very quickly will he come by death, to turn the key, to open the door of the grave for thine admittance thither, and to lead thee through it into the now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known regions of the inviſible world. Nor is it long
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:021060_0288_0FB20E52994540E8"/>
before the judge, who <q>ſtandeth, at the door James 5, 9.</q> will appear alſo to the univerſal judgment: and though perhaps not only ſcores but hundreds of years may lie between that period and the preſent moment, yet it is but a very ſmall point of time to him, who views at once all the unmeaſurable ages of a paſt and future eternity. <q>A thouſand years are with him but as one day, and one day as a thouſand years 2 Pet. 3, 8.</q> In both theſe ſenſes then does he come quickly; and I truſt you can anſwer, with a glad <hi>Amen,</hi> that the warning is not terrible or unpleaſant to your ears, but rather that his coming, his certain, his ſpeedy coming, is the object of your delightful hope, and of your long expectation.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. I am ſure it is reaſonable it ſhould be ſo; and yet perhaps Nature, fond of life, and unwilling to part with a long known abode, to enter on a ſtate to which it is entirely a ſtranger, may recoil from the thoughts of dying; or, ſtruck with the awful pomp of an expiring and diſſolving world, may look on the judgment-day with ſome mixture of terror. And therefore my dear brother in the Lord, (for as ſuch I can now eſtem you,) I would reaſon with you a little on this head, and would intreat you to look more attentively on this ſolemn ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which will, I truſt, grow leſs diſagreeable to you, as it is more familiarly viewed. Nay, I hope, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſtarting back from it, you will rather ſpring forward towards it with joy and delight.</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. Think, O Chriſtian, when Chriſt comes to call you away by death, he comes—to ſet you at liberty from your preſent ſorrows,—to deliver you from your ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles with remaining corruption,—and to receive you to dwell with himſelf in complete holineſs and joy. You ſhall <q>be abſent from the body, and be preſent with the Lord 2 Cor. 5, 8.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">§ 4. He will indeed call you away from this world! But, oh, what is this world that you ſhould be fond of it, and cling to it with ſo much eagerneſs? How low are all thoſe enjoyments that are peculiar to it; and how many its vexations, its ſnares, and its ſorrows? Review your pilgrimage thus far; and though you muſt ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowledge, that <q>goodneſs and mercy have followed
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:021060_0289_0FB20E56617C0D50"/>
you all the days of your life Pſal. 23, 6.</q> yet has not that very mercy itſelf planted ſome thorns in your paths, and given you ſome wiſe and neceſſary, yet pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, intimations, that "this is not your reſt Mic. 2, 10?" Review the monuments of your withered joys, of your blaſted hopes; if there be yet any monuments of them remaining, more than a mournful remembrance they have left behind in your afflicted heart. Look upon the graves that have ſwallowed up many of your deareſt and moſt amiable friends, perhaps in the very bloom of life, and in the greateſt intimacy of your converſe with them; and reflect, that if you hold it out a few years more, death will renew its conqueſts at your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and devour the moſt precious of thoſe that yet ſurvive. View the living as well as the dead; behold the ſtate of human nature, under the many grievous marks of its apoſtacy from God; and ſay, whether a wiſe and good man would wiſh to continue always here.</p>
               <p>Methinks, were I myſelf ſecure from being reached by any of the arrows that fly around me, I could not but mourn to ſee the wounds that are given by them, and to hear the groans of thoſe that are continually falling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them. The diſeaſes and calamities of mankind are ſo many, and, which is moſt grievous of all, the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of their minds are ſo various and ſo threatening, that the world appears almoſt like an hoſpital: and a man, whoſe heart is tender, is ready to feel his ſpirits broken, as he walks through it, and ſurveys the ſad ſcene; eſpecially when he ſees how little he can do for the recovery of thoſe whom he pities. Are you a Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and does it not pierce your heart to ſee how human nature is ſunk in vice and in ſhame? to ſee with what amazing inſolence ſome are making themſelves openly vile, and how the name of Chriſt is diſhonoured by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny too that call themſelves his people? to ſee the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful deeds and filthy practices of them that live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly, and to behold, at the ſame time, the infirmities at leaſt, and irregularities, of thoſe concerning whom we have better hopes? and do you not wiſh to eſcape from ſuch a world, where a righteous and compaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate ſoul muſt be vexed from day to day by ſo many ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles of ſin and miſery 2 Pet. 2, 8?"</p>

Yea, to come nearer home; do you not feel ſomething within you which you long to quit, and which would imbitter even Paradiſe itſelf? ſomething, which, were it to continue, would grieve and diſtreſs you even in the ſociety of the bleſſed? Do you not feel a remainder of indwelling ſin; the ſad conſequence of the original revolt of our nature from God? Are you not ſtruggling every day with ſome reſidue of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or at leaſt mourning on account of the weakneſs of your graces? Do you not often find your ſpirits dull and languid when you would deſire to raiſe them to the greateſt fervor in the ſervice of God? Do you not find your hearts too often inſenſible of the richeſt inſtances of his love, and your hands feeble in his ſervice, even when "to will is preſent with you Rom. 7, 18?" Does not your life, in its beſt days and hours, appear a low, unprofitable thing, when compared with what you are ſenſible it ought to be, and with what you wiſh that it were? Are you not frequently, as it were, ſtretching the pinions of the mind, and ſaying, <q>Oh that I had wings like a dove, that I might fly away and be at reſt Pſ. 55, 6?</q>

That he comes to anſwer your wiſhes, and to fulfil the largeſt deſires of your hearts; thoſe deſires that he himſelf has inſpired?

For with regard to his final appearance to judgment, our Lord ſays, Surely I come quickly, in the ſenſe illuſtrated before: and ſo it will appear to us, if we compare this interval of time with the bliſsful eternity which is to ſucceed it; and probably if we compare it with thoſe ages which have already paſſed, ſince the ſun began to meaſure out to earth its days and its years.

He will come to diſplay his magnificence, deſcending from heaven <q>with a ſhout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God 1 Theſſ. 4, 16.</q> taking his ſeat upon a throne infinitely exceeding that of earthly, or even of celeſtial princes, clothed with <q>his Father's glory and his own Luke 9, 26. ſurrounded with a numberleſs hoſt of ſhining attendants, when coming to be glorified in his ſaints, and admired in all them that believe 2 Theſſ. 1, 10.</q> His enemies ſhall alſo be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to grace his triumph: the ſerpent ſhall be ſeen there rolling in the duſt, and trodden under foot by him and by all his ſervants: thoſe who once condemned him ſhall tremble at his preſence; and thoſe who bowed the knee before him in profane mockery ſhall, in wild de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, <q>call to the mountains to fall upon them, and to the rocks to hide them, from the face of that Lamb of God Rev. 6, 16.</q> whom they they once led away to the moſt inhuman ſlaughter.</p>

               <argument>

(2.)</hi> To review the humiliation of the ſoul before God, and its application to the blood of Chriſt, § <hi>5.— (3.)</hi> To exerciſe patience under bodily pains and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, § <hi>6.

               </argument>
               <p n="1">§ 1. THUS, my dear reader, I have endeavoured to lead you through a variety of circumſtances; and thoſe not fancied and imaginary, but ſuch as do indeed occur in the human and Chriſtian life. And I can truly and chearfully ſay, that I have marked out to you the path which I myſelf have trod, and in which it is my deſire ſtill to go on. I have ventured my own everlaſting intereſts on that foundation on which I have directed you to adventure yours. What I have recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended as the grand buſineſs of your life, I deſire to make the buſineſs of my own; and the moſt conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enjoyments which I expect or deſire in the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing days of my pilgrimage on earth, are ſuch as I have directed you to ſeek, and endeavoured to aſſiſt you in attaining. Such love to God, ſuch conſtant activity in his ſervice, ſuch pleaſurable views of what lies beyond the grave, appear to me (God is my witneſs,) a felicity incomparable beyond any thing elſe which can offer it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to our affection and purſuit: and I would not for
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:021060_0298_0FB20E6B6312FD18"/>
ten thouſand worlds reſign my ſhare in them, or conſent even to the ſuſpenſion of the delights which they afford, during the remainder of my abode here.</p>
               <p n="2">§ 2. I would humbly hope, through the divine bleſſing, that the hours you have ſpent in the review of theſe plain things may have turned to ſome profitable account, and that in conſequence of what you have read, you have either been brought into the way of life and peace, or been induced to quicken your pace in it. Moſt heartily ſhould I rejoice in being further uſeful to you, and that even to the laſt. Now there is one ſcene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining; a ſcene through which you muſt infallibly paſs, which has ſomething in it ſo awful, that I cannot but attempt doing a little to aſſiſt you in it; I mean the dark valley of the ſhadow of death. I would earneſtly wiſh, that, for the credit of your profeſſion, the comfort of your own ſoul, and the joy and edification of your ſurviving friends, you might die not only ſafely, but ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably too: and therefore I would offer you a few parting advices. I am ſenſible indeed that Providence may determine the circumſtances of your death in ſuch a manner as that you may have no opportunity of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the hints I now give you. Some unexpected accident from without, or from within, may, as it were, whirl you to heaven before you are aware; and you may find yourſelf ſo ſuddenly there, that it may ſeem a tranſlation rather than a death. Or it is poſſible the force of a diſtemper may affect your underſtanding in ſuch a manner that you may be quite inſenſible of the circumſtances in which you are; and ſo your diſſolution (though others may ſee it viſibly and certainly approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may be as great a ſurpriſe to you as if you died in full health.</p>
               <p n="3">§ 3. But as it is, on the whole, probable you may have a more ſenſible paſſage out of time into eternity; and as much may, in various reſpects, depend on your dying behaviour, give me leave to propoſe ſome plain directions with relation to it, to be practiſed, if God give you opportunity, and remind you of them. It may not be improper to look over the twenty-ninth chapter again, when you find the ſymptoms of any threatening diſorder: and I the rather hope, that what
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:021060_0299_0FB20C2DE239E6E0"/>
I ſay may be uſeful to you, as methinks, I find myſelf diſpoſed to addreſs you with ſomething of that peculiar tenderneſs which we feel for a dying friend; to whom, as we expect that we ſhall ſpeak to him no more, we ſend out, as it were, all our hearts in every word.</p>
               <p n="4">§ 4. I would adviſe then, in the firſt place, "that, as ſoon as poſſible, you would endeavour to get rid of all further care with regard to your temporal concerns, by ſettling them in time, in as reaſonable and Chriſtian a manner as you can." I could wiſh, there may be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of that kind to hurry your mind when you are leaſt able to bear it, or to diſtreſs or divide thoſe who come after you. Do that which, in the preſence of God, you judge moſt equitable, and which you verily believe will be moſt pleaſing to him. Do it in as pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and effectual a manner as you can: and then conſider the world as a place you have quite done with, and its affairs as nothing farther to you, more than to one actually dead; unleſs as you may do any good to its inhabitants while yet you continue among them; and may, by any circumſtance in your laſt actions or words in life leave a bleſſing behind you to thoſe who have been your friends and fellow-travellers, while you have been diſpatching that journey through it, which you are now finiſhing.</p>
               <p n="5">§ 5. That you may be the more at leiſure, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prepared for this, "enter into ſome ſerious review of your own ſtate, and endeavour to put your ſoul into as fit a poſture as poſſible, for your ſolemn appearance before God." For a ſolemn thing indeed it is to go into his immediate preſence! to ſtand before him, not as a ſupplicant at the throne of his grace, but at his bar as a ſeperate ſpirit, whoſe time of probation is over, and whoſe eternal ſtate is to be immediately determined. Renew your humiliation before God for the imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of your life, though it has in the main been devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his ſervice. Renew your application to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of God, as promiſed in the covenant of grace, and to the blood of Chriſt, as the bleſſed channel in which they flow. Reſign yourſelf entirely to the divine diſpoſal and conduct, as willing to ſerve God, either in this world or the other, as he ſhall ſee fit. And ſenſible of
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:021060_0300_0FB20C2F26B90E30"/>
your ſinfulneſs on the one hand, and of the divine wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodneſs on the other, ſummon up all the forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of your ſoul to bear, as well as you can, whatever his afflicting hand may further lay upon you, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the laſt ſtroke of it, as one who would obtain the moſt entire ſubjection to the great and good Father of ſpirits.</p>
               <p n="6">§ 6. Whatever you ſuffer, <q>endeavour to ſhow your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf an example of patience." Let that amiable grace have its perfect work James 1, 4;</q> and ſince it has ſo little more to do, let it cloſe the ſcene nobly. Let there not be a murmuring word; and that there may not, watch againſt every repining thought; and when you feel any thing of that kind ariſing, look by faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a dying Saviour, and aſk your own heart, "was not his croſs much more painful than the bed on which I lie? Was not his ſituation among blood-thirſty enemies infinitely more terrible than mine amidſt the tenderneſs and care of ſo many affectionate friends? Did not the heavy load of my ſins preſs him in a much more over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming manner than I am preſſed by the load of theſe afflictions? and yet he bore all "as a Lamb" that is brought "to the ſlaughter Iſa. 53, 7." Let the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of his ſufferings be a means to ſweeten your's: yea, let it cauſe you to rejoice, when you are called to bear the croſs for a little while, before you wear the crown. Count it all joy that you have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity yet once more of honouring God by your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, which is now acting its laſt part, and will in a few days, perhaps in a few hours, be ſuperſeded by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete everlaſting bleſſedneſs. And I am willing to hope, that in theſe views you will not only ſuppreſs all paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate complaints, but that your mouth will be filled with the praiſes of God? And that you will be ſpeaking to thoſe that are about you, not only of his juſtice, but of his goodneſs too. So that you will be enabled to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate your inward joys in ſuch a manner, as may be a lively and edifying comment upon thoſe words of the apoſtle, <q>Tribulation worketh patience; and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, experience; and experience, hope; even a hope which maketh not aſhamed, while the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt, which is given unto us Rom. 5, 3.4.5.</q>

And now, my dear friend, now is the time, when it is eſpecially expected from you that you bear an honourable teſtimony to religion. Tell thoſe that are about you, as well as you can, (for you will never be able fully to expreſs it,) what comfort and ſupport you have found in it. Tell them, how it has brightened the darkeſt circumſtances of your life; tell them, how it now reconciles you to the near views of death. Your words will carry with them a peculiar weight at ſuch a ſeaſon: there will be a kind of eloquence, even in the infirmities with which you are ſtruggling, while you give them utterance; and you will be heard with atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with tenderneſs, with credit.

               <p n="8">§ 8. And, to inforce the conviction the more, "give a ſolemn charge to thoſe that are about you, that they ſpend their lives in the ſervice of God, and govern themſelves by the principles of real religion." You may remember, that Joſhua and David, and other good men did ſo, when they perceived that the days drew near in which they ſhould die. And you know not how the admonitions of a dying friend, or (as it may be with reſpect to ſome,) of a dying parent, may impreſs thoſe who may have diſregarded what you and others may have ſaid to them before. At leaſt, make the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and die labouring to glorify God, to ſave ſouls, and generouſly to ſow the ſeeds of goodneſs and happineſs in a world where you have no more harveſts to reap. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they may ſpring up in a plentiful crop when the clods of the valley are covering your body: but if not,
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:021060_0302_0FB20C32D9BDCC48"/>
God will approve it; and the angels that wait around your bed to receive your departing ſoul will look upon each other with marks of approbation in their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and own that this is to expire like a Chriſtian, and to make a glorious improvement of mortality.</p>
               <p n="9">§ 9. And, in this laſt addreſs to your fellow-mortals, whoever they are that providence brings near you "be ſure that you tell how entirely and how chearfully your hopes and dependence in this ſeaſon of the laſt extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are fixed, not upon your own merits and obedience, but on what the great Redeemer has done and ſuffered for ſinners." Let them ſee that you die, as it were, at the foot of the croſs: nothing will be ſo comfortable to yourſelf, nothing ſo edifying to them. Let the name of Jeſus, therefore, be in your mouth, while you are able to ſpeak; and when you can ſpeak no longer, let it be in your heart, and endeavour that the laſt act of your ſoul, while it continues in the body, may be an act of humble faith in Chriſt. <q>Come unto God by him: enter into that which is within the veil, as with the blood of ſprinkling, freſh upon you.</q> It is an awful thing for ſuch a ſinner (as you, my Chriſtian friend, with all the virtues the world may have admired, know yourſelf to be) to ſtand before that infinitely pure and holy Being, who has ſeen all your ways, and all your heart, and has a perfect knowledge of every mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of imperfection, which has attended the beſt of your duties; but venture in that way, and you will find it both ſafe and pleaſant.</p>

Once more: "To give you comfort in a dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hour, and to ſupport your feeble ſteps while you are travelling through this dark and painful way, take the word of God as a ſtaff in your hand." Let books and mortal friends, now do their laſt office for you. Call, if you can, ſome experienced Chriſtian, who has felt the power of the word of God upon his own heart; and let him bring the ſcripture, and turn you to ſome of thoſe precious promiſes, which have been the food and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing of his own ſoul. It is with this view, that I may carry the good office I am now engaged in, as far as poſſible. I ſhall here give you a collection of a few ſuch admirable ſcriptures, each of them infinitely <q>more

May your ſoul and mine be then compoſed to a ſacred ſilence (whatever be the commotion of animal nature) while the voice of God ſpeaks to us in language which he ſpoke to his ſervants of old, or in which he inſtructed them how they ſhould ſpeak to him, in circumſtances of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt extremity!</p>

In my Father's houſe are many manſions; if it were not ſo, I would have told you: I go to prepare a place for you.

                  <p>O THOU ſupreme Ruler of the viſible and inviſible worlds! thou Sovereign of life and of death; of earth and of heaven! Bleſſed be thy name, I have often been taught to ſeek thee.

                  <p>The hour is come when thou wilt ſeparate me from this world, with which I have been ſo long and ſo fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly acquainted, and lead me to another as yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. Enable me, I beſeech thee, to make the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change as becomes a child of Abraham, who being <q>called of thee to receive an inheritance, obeyed, and went out, though he knew not particularly whither he went Heb. 11, 8.</q> as becomes a child of God, who knows that, through ſovereign grace, <q>it is his Father's good pleaſure to give him the kingdom Luke 12, 32!</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I acknowledge, O Lord, the juſtice of that ſentence by which I am expiring; and own thy wiſdom and goodneſs in appointing my journey through this gloomy vale which is now before me.

                  <p>Gracious Father, I would not quit this earth of thine, and this houſe of clay in which I have ſojourned during my abode upon the face of it, without my grateful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments to thee, for all that abundant goodneſs which thou haſt cauſed to paſs before me here Exo. 33, 19.

life, was ſo long ſpared: that it has been ſtill maintained by ſuch a rich variety of thy bounty. I thank thee that thou haſt made this beginning of my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence ſo pleaſant to me. I thank thee for the mercies of my days and nights, of my months and years, which are now come to their period: I thank thee for the mercies of my infancy, and for thoſe of my riper age; for all the agreeable friends which thou haſt given me in this houſe of my pilgrimage, the living and the dead; for all the help I have received from others, and for all the opportunities which thou haſt given me of being helpful to the bodies or ſouls of my brethren of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Surely goodneſs and mercy have followed me all the days of my life Pſal. 23, 6. and I have reaſon to riſe a thankful gueſt from the various and pleaſant entertainments with which my table has been furniſhed by thee. Nor ſhall I have reaſon to repine or to grieve, at quitting them: For, O my God, are thy bounties exhauſted? I know that they are not. I will not wrong thy goodneſs and thy faithfulneſs ſo much as to imagine, that becauſe I am going from this earth, I am going from happineſs. I adore thy mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that thou haſt taught me to entertain nobler views through Jeſus thy Son. I bleſs thee with all the powers of my nature, that I ever heard of his name, and of his death: and would fain exert a more vigorous act of thankful adoration than in this broken ſtate I am capable of, while I am extolling thee for the riches of thy grace manifeſted in him; for his inſtructions and his example, for his blood and his righteouſneſs, and for that bleſſed Spirit of thine which thou haſt given me, to turn my ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful heart unto thyſelf, and to bring me into the bonds of thy covenant; of that covenant, which is <q>ordered in all things and ſure 2 Sam. 23, 5,</q> and which this death, though now ſeparating my ſoul from my body, ſhall never be able to diſſolve.</p>
                  <p>I bleſs thee, O Lord, that I am not dying in an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate and impenitent ſtate; but that thou didſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly awaken and convince me; that thou didſt renew and ſanctify my heart, and didſt by thy good Spirit work in it an unfeigned faith, and real repentance, and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of a divine life. I thank thee for miniſters and
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:021060_0307_0FB20C4024D2F4C8"/>

I thank thee for thy bleſſed word, and for thoſe exceeding rich and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes of it, which now lie as a cordial warm at my heart in this chilling hour; promiſes of ſupport in death, and of glory beyond it, and of the reſurrection of my body to everlaſting life. O my God, I firmly believe them all, great and wonderful as they are, and am <q>waiting for the accompliſhment of them through Jeſus Chriſt; in whom they are all yea and amen 3 Cor. 1, 20. Remember thy word unto thy ſervant on which thou haſt cauſed me to hope Pſal. 119, 40!</q> I covenanted with thee not for worldly enjoyments, which thy love taught me comparatively to deſpiſe; but for eternal life, as <q>the gift of thy free grace through Jeſus Chriſt my Lord Rom. 6, 23;</q> and now permit me, in his name, to enter my humble claim to it! Permit me to conſign this departing ſpirit into thine hand; for <q>thou haſt redeemed it, O Lord God of truth Pſal. 31, 5? I am thine ſave me Pſal. 119, 94,</q> and make me happy!</p>
                  <p>But may I indeed preſume to ſay, I am thine! O God, now I am ſtanding on the borders of both worlds; now I view things as in the light of thy preſence and of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; how unworthy do I appear, that I ſhould be taken to dwell with thy angels and ſaints in glory! Alas, I have reaſon to look back with deep humiliation on a poor unprofitable ſinful life, in which I have daily been deſerving to be caſt into hell. But I have this one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable reflection, that I have fled to the croſs of Chriſt; and I now renew my application to it. To think of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing before God in ſuch an imperfect righteouſneſs as my own, were then thouſand times worſe than death. No, Lord! I come unto thee as a ſinner; but as a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner who has believed in thy Son for pardon and life: I fall down before thee as a guilty polluted wretch; but thou haſt made him to be unto thy people for wiſdom and righteouſneſs, for ſanctification and redemption 1 Cor. 1, 30."

And <q>I know in whom I have believed 2 Tim. 1, 12.</q> The infernal lion may attempt to diſmay me in this awful paſſage: but I rejoice that I am in the hands of the good Shepherd John 10, 11.28; and I defy all my ſpiritual enemies, in a chearful dependence on his faithful care. I lift up my eyes and my heart to him, who <q>was dead and is alive again; and behold he lives for ever more, and hath the keys of death, and of the unſeen world Rev. 6, 18.</q> Bleſſed Jeſus, I die by thine hand, and I fear no harm from the hand of a Saviour! I fear not that death which is allotted to me by the hand of my deareſt Lord, who himſelf died to make it ſafe and happy. I come, Lord, I come, not only with a willing, but with a joyful conſent. I thank thee that thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membereſt me for good; that thou art breaking my chains, and calling me to "the glorious liberty of the children of God Rom. 8, 21." I thank thee, that thou wilt no longer permit me to live at a diſtance from thine arms; but after this long abſence, wilt have me at home, at home for ever.</p>
                  <p>My feeble nature faints in the view of that glory, which is now dawning upon me; but thou knoweſt how, gracious Lord, to let it in upon my ſoul by juſt degrees, and to <q>make thy ſtrength perfect in my weakneſs 2 Cor. 12, 9.</q> Once more, for the laſt time, would I look down on this poor world, which I am going to quit, and breathe out my dying vows for its proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and that of thy church in it. I have loved it, O Lord, as a living member of the body; and I love it to the laſt. I humbly beſeech thee, therefore, that thou wilt guard it, and purify it, and unite it more and more! Send down more of thy bleſſed Spirit upon it, even the Spirit of wiſdom, of holineſs, and of love; till in due time <q>the wilderneſs be turned into a garden of the Lord Iſa. 51, 3. and all fleſh ſhall ſee thy ſalvation Luke 3, 6!</q>

                  <p>And as for me, bear me, O my heavenly Father, on the wings of everlaſting love, to that peaceful, that

holy, that joyous abode, which thy mercy has prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for me, and which the blood of my Redeemer hath purchaſed! Bear me <q>to the general aſſembly and church of the firſt-born, to the innumerable company of angels, and to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect Heb. 12, 22.23.</q> And whatever this fleſh may ſuffer, let my ſteady ſoul be delightfully fixed on that glory to which it is raiſed! Let faith perform its laſt office in an honourable manner! Let my few re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining moments on earth be ſpent for thy glory; and ſo let me aſcend, with love in my heart, and praiſe on my faultering tongue, to the world where love and praiſe ſhall be complete! Be this my laſt ſong on earth, which I am going to tune in heaven; <q>Bleſſing, and honour, and glory, and Power, be unto him that fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth on the throne, and to the Lamb for ever and ever, Rev. 5, 13.</q>

            <p>IT was the amiable character of our bleſſed Redeemer, that <hi>he went about doing good</hi> Acts 10, 38. This great motive which animated all his actions, brought him to the houſe of his friend Lazarus at Bethany, and directed his behaviour there. Though it were a ſeaſon of receſs from public labour, our Lord brought the ſentiments and the pious cares of a preacher of righteouſneſs into the parlour of a friend; and there his doctrine dropped as the rain, and diſtilled as the dew, on the little happy circle that were then ſurrounding him. Mary, the ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Lazarus, with great delight, made one amongſt them; ſhe ſet herſelf down at the feet of Jeſus, in the poſture of an humble diſciple; and we have a great deal of reaſon to believe, that Martha his ſiſter, would glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been with her there; but domeſtic care preſſed hard upon her, and ſhe was cumbered with much ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, being perhaps too ſolicitous to prepare a ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous entertainment for her heavenly Maſter, and the train that attended him. Happy are they that in a crowd of buſineſs, do not looſe ſomething of the ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of their minds, and of the compoſure and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their tempers! This good woman comes to our Lord with too impatient a complaint; inſinuating ſome little reflection, not only on Mary, but on himſelf too.

            <p>My friends, the words which are now before us are, to this day, as true as they were ſeventeen hundred years ago. Set your hearts to attend to them. Oh that you might, by divine grace, be awakened to hear them with a due regard, and might be ſo impreſſed with the plain and ſerious things which are now to be ſpoken, as you probably would, if I were ſpeaking by your dying beds, and you had the full exerciſe of your reaſon, and the near and lively view of eternity!</p>
            <p n="1">I. I am briefly to conſider what we are to underſtand by the one thing needful.</p>
            <p>Now, I anſwer in a few words, it is the care of the ſoul, oppoſed, as you ſee in the text, to the care, <hi>i. e.</hi>
               <pb n="299" facs="unknown:021060_0312_0FB20C47EA930470"/>
the exceſſive care of the body; for which Martha was gently admoniſhed by our Lord. This is a general an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, and it comprehends a variety of important parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, which is the buſineſs of our miniſtry often to open to you at large: The care of the ſoul implies a readineſs to hear the words of Chriſt, to ſet ourſelves with Mary at his feet, and to receive both the law and the goſpel from his mouth. It ſuppoſes that we learn from this divine teacher the worth of our ſouls, their danger, and their remedy. That we become above all things ſolicitous about their eternal ſalvation. That, heartily repenting of all our ſins, and cordially believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the everlaſting goſpel, we receive the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for righteouſneſs and life, reſting our ſouls on the value of his atonement, and the efficacy of his grace. It imports the ſincere dedication of ourſelves to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, and a faithful adherence to it, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the oppoſitions ariſing from inward corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or outward temptations, and a reſolute perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence in the way of goſpel dependence, till we receive the end of our faith in our complete ſalvation. This is the one thing needful repreſented indeed in various ſcriptures by various names. Sometimes it is called re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation, or the new creature, becauſe it is the bleſſed work of God's efficacious grace. Sometimes the fear of God, and ſometimes his love, and the keeping his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments; and very frequently in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it is called faith, or receiving Chriſt, and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on him, which therefore is repreſented as the great work of God John 6, 9; <hi>i. e.</hi> the great thing which God in his glorious goſpel requires, as well as by his Spirit produces in us each of theſe, if rightly underſtood and explained, comprehends all that I have ſaid on this head. On the whole, we may ſay, that, as the body is one, though it has many members, and the ſoul is one, though it has many faculties, ſo in the preſent caſe, this real, vital religion is one thing, one ſacred principle of divine life, bringing us to attend to the care of our ſouls, as of our greateſt treaſure. It is one thing, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the variety of views in which it may be conſidered, and of characters under which it may be deſcribed. I proceed,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="300" facs="unknown:021060_0313_0FB20C4A18312D20"/>II. To conſider what may be intended in the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation which is here made of it, as the one thing needful.</p>
            <p>Now I think it naturally includes theſe three parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars: it is a matter of univerſal concern, of the higheſt importance, and of ſo comprehenſive a nature, that every thing which is truly worthy of our regard, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as included in it, or ſubſervient to it. Let me a little illuſtrate each of theſe particulars, reſerving the proof of what I now aſſert to the third general, where it will abundantly appear.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The care of the ſoul may be called the one thing needful, "as it is matter of univerſal concern."</p>
            <p>Our Lord you ſee ſpeaks of it as needful in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. He ſays not for this or that particular perſon; or for thoſe of ſuch an age, ſtation, or circumſtance in life, but needful for all. And indeed, when diſcourſing on ſuch a ſubject, one might properly introduce it with thoſe ſolemn words of the Pſalmiſt. <hi>Give ear all ye people, hear all ye inhabitants of the earth, both high and low, rich and poor together</hi> Pſ. 49, 1.2. For it is the concern of all, from the king that ſits upon the throne, to the ſervant that grindeth at the mill, or the beggar that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon the dunghill. It is needful for us that are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, for our own ſalvation is concerned. And woe, unſupportable woe, will be to our ſouls, if we think it enough to recommend it to others, to talk of it in a warm, or an awful manner, in public aſſemblies, or in our private converſe: while it doth not penetrate our hearts as our own greateſt care. Our caſe will then be like that of the Iſraelitiſh Lord in Samaria 2 Kings 7, 2. who was employed to diſtribute the corn when the ſiege was raiſed, ſeeing it with our eyes, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing it with our hands, we ſhall ourſelves die miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, without taſting the bleſſings we impart. It is needful to all you that are our hearers, without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of one ſingle perſon. It is needful to you that are rich, though it may on ſome accounts be peculiarly difficult for you; even as difficult, comparatively ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as for <hi>a camel to go through the eye of a needle</hi> Mat. 19, 24; yet if it be neglected, you are poor in the midſt of all your wealth, and miſerable in all your abundance,
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:021060_0314_0FB20C4DAD507AA8"/>
and a wretch ſtarving for hunger, in a magnificent palace and a rich dreſs, might be leſs the object of compaſſion than you. It is needful for you that are poor; though you are diſtreſſed with ſo many anxious cares, <hi>what you ſhall eat, and what you ſhall drink, and wherewithal you ſhall be cloathed</hi> Mat. 6, 31. The nature that makes you capable of ſuch anxieties as theſe, argues your much greater concern in the <hi>bread which endures to eternal life</hi> John 6, 27, than in that by which this mortal body muſt be ſupported. It is needful for you that are advanced in years; though your ſtrength be impaired, ſo that the <hi>graſhopper is a burthen</hi> Eccl. 12, 5; though you have by your long continuance in ſin ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered this great work ſo hard that were it leſs impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, one would in pity let you alone without remind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you of it; yet, late as it is, it muſt be done, or your hoary heads will be brought down to the grave with wrath, and ſink under a curſe aggravated by every year and by every day of your lives. It is needful to you that are young, though ſolicited by ſo many gay vanities, to neglect it; though it may be repreſented as an unſeaſonable care at preſent, yet I repeat it, it is needful to you; immediately needful, unleſs you who walk ſo frequently over the duſt of your brethren and companions, that died in the bloom and vigor of their days, have made ſome ſecret covenant with the grave for yourſelves, and found out ſome wonderful method, hitherto unknown, of ſecuring this precarious life, and of anſwering for days and months to come, while others cannot anſwer for one ſingle moment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The care of the ſoul is <q>a matter of the higheſt importance;</q> beyond any thing which can be brought into compariſon with it.</p>
            <p>As Solomon ſays of wiſdom, that it is more precious than rubies; and that all things which can be deſired are not to be compared with her Prov. 3, 15. So may I properly ſay of this great and moſt important branch of wiſdom, whatever can be laid in the balance with it; will be found altogether lighter than vanity. This is ſtrongly implied when its ſaid in the next text, one thing is needful; <hi>q. d.</hi> One thing, and one thing alone i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſo. Juſt as the bleſſed God is ſaid to be <hi>only wiſe</hi>
               <pb n="302" facs="unknown:021060_0315_0FB20C4EAABD5478"/>
1 Tim. 1, 17, and <hi>only holy</hi> Rev. 15, 4, becauſe the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and holineſs of angels and men is as nothing when compared with his. What ſeems moſt great and important in life, what kings and ſenates, what the wiſeſt and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of this world are imploying their time, their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, their pens, their labours upon, are trifles, when compared with this one thing. A man may ſubſiſt, he may in ſome conſiderable meaſure be happy, without learning, without riches, without titles, without health, without liberty, without friends, nay though <hi>the life be more than meat, and the body than raiment</hi> Mat. 6, 25. Yet may he be happy, unſpeakably happy, without the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy itſelf. But he cannot be ſo in the neglect of the one thing needful. I muſt therefore beſpeak your regard to it in the words of <hi>Moſes, It is not a light thing, but it is your life</hi> Deut. 32, 47.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The care of the ſoul is of ſo comprehenſive a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that every thing truely worthy of our regard may "be conſidered as included in it, or ſubſervient to it."</p>
            <p>As David obſerves, that the <hi>commandment of God is exceeding broad</hi> Pſal. 119, 96, ſo may we ſay of this one thing needful; and as Solomon very juſtly and empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically expreſſes it, to fear God and keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is the whole of man; his whole duty, and his whole intereſt; and every thing which is wiſe and rational does in its proper place and connection make a part of. We ſhould judge very ill concerning the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this care, if we imagined, that it conſiſted merely in acts of devotion or religious contemplation; it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends all the lovely and harmonious bonds of ſocial, and human virtues. It requires a care of ſociety, a care of our bodies, and of our temporal concerns; but then all is to be regulated, directed, and animated by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per regards to God, Chriſt, and immortality. Our food, and our reſt, our trades and our labours are to be attended to, and all the offices of humanity performed in obedience to the will of God, for the glory of Chriſt, and in a view to the improving the mind in a growing meekneſs for a ſtate of complete per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. Name any thing which has no reference at all to this, and you name a worthleſs trifle, however it may be gilded to allure the eye, however it may be ſweetened
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:021060_0316_0FB20C50F5FF7898"/>
to gratify the taſte. Name a thing which, inſtead of thus improving the ſoul, has a tendency to debaſe and pollute, to enſlave and endanger it, and you name what is moſt unprofitable and miſchievous, be the wages of iniquity ever ſo great; moſt foul and deformed, be it in the eyes of men ever ſo honourable; or in their cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms ever ſo faſhionable. Thus I have endeavoured to ſhew you what we may ſuppoſe implied in this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of one thing needful. I am now,</p>
            <p n="3">III. To ſhew you with how much propriety the care of the ſoul may be repreſented under this character, as the one thing needful, as a matter of univerſal and moſt ſerious concern, to which every thing elſe is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as ſubſervient, if at all worthy of our care and purſuit. Now let me appeal to the ſentiments of thoſe who muſt be allowed moſt capable of judging, and to the evident reaſon of the care of itſelf, as it muſt appear to every unprejudiced mind.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let me argue from the ſentiments of thoſe who muſt be allowed moſt capable of judging in ſuch an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, and we ſhall quickly ſee that the care of the ſoul appears to them the one thing needful.</p>
            <p>Is the judgment of the bleſſed God according to truth, how evidently and how ſolemnly is that judgment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared? I will not ſay merely in this or the other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular paſſage of his word, but in the whole ſeries of his revelations to the children of men; and the whole tenor of his addreſſes to them. Is not this the language of all, from the early days of Job and Moſes, to the concluſion of the canon of Scripture. If wiſdom be hid from the eyes of all the living, ſurely God underſtandeth the way thereof, he knoweth the place thereof; and if he does, it is plainly pointed out, for <hi>unto man he ſtill ſaith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the fear of the Lord, that is wiſdom, and to depart from evil, that is underſtanding</hi> Job 28, 21.23.28. By Moſes therefore, he declared to the Iſraelites, that to do the commandments of the Lord, would be their wiſdom and their underſtanding in the ſight of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions who ſhould hear his ſtatutes, and ſay, ſurely this is a wiſe and underſtanding people Deut. 4, 6. When he had raiſed up one man on the throne of Iſrael, with the character of the wiſeſt that ever lived upon the face of
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:021060_0317_0FB20C525A3BB2C0"/>
the earth, he choſe to make him eminently a teacher of this great truth. And now all that he ſpoke on the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and leſs concerning ſubjects of natural philoſophy is loſt, <hi>though he ſpoke of trees from the cedar to the byſſop, and of beaſts, and of fowls, and of creeping things, and of fiſhes</hi> 2 Kings 6, 33; that ſaying is preſerved in which he teſtifies, that <hi>the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdom</hi> Prov. 1, 7.9.10. and thoſe proverbs, in almoſt every line of which they who neglect God and their own ſouls are ſpoken of as fools, as if that were the moſt proper ſignification of the word, while the religious a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone are honoured with the title of wiſe. But, in this reſpect, as atteſting this truth in the name of God and in his own, a greater than Solomon is here.</p>
            <p>For if we require what it was that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt judged to be the one thing needful, the words of the text contain as full an anſwer as can be imagined; and the ſenſe of them is repeated in a very lively and emphatical manner, in that remarkable paſſage wherein our Lord not only declares his own judgment, but ſeems to appeal to the conſciences of all, as obliged by their own ſecret convictions to ſubſcribe to the truth of it. <hi>What is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul, or what will a man give in exchange for his ſoul</hi> Mat. 16, 26? If it were once loſt, what would he not be willing to give to redeem it. But it depends not on the words of Chriſt alone. Let his actions, his ſufferings, his blood, his death, ſpeak what a value he ſet on the ſouls of men. Is it to be imagined, that he would have relinquiſhed heaven, that he would have dwelt upon earth, that he would have laboured by night and by day, and at laſt have expired on the croſs, for a matter of light importance? Or can we think that he, in whom dwells all the treaſures of wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily, was miſtaken in a judgment ſo deliberately formed, and ſo ſolemnly declared.</p>
            <p>If, after this, there were room to mention human judgment and teſtimonies, how eaſy would it be to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a cloud of witneſſes in ſuch a cauſe, and to ſhew that the wiſeſt and beſt, of men in all ages of the world have agreed in this point, that, amidſt all the diverſities
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:021060_0318_0FB20C566DF63C40"/>
of opinion and profeſſion, which ſucceeding generations have produced, this has been the unanimous judgment, this the common and moſt ſollicitous care of thoſe, whoſe characters are moſt truly valuable, to ſecure the ſalvation of their own ſouls, and to promote the ſalvation of others.</p>
            <p>And let me beſeech you ſeriouſly to reflect what are the characters of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> who have taken the liberty, moſt boldly and freely t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> clare their judgment on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſide? The number of ſuch is comparatively few; and when you compare what you have obſerved of their temper and conduct, I will not ſay with what you read of holy men of old, but with what you have yourſelf ſeen in the faithful active, and zealous ſervants of Chriſt, in theſe latter ages, with which you have converſed, do you on the whole find that the rejectors and deriders of the goſpel, are, in other reſpects, ſo much more prudent and judicious, ſo much wiſer for themſelves, and for others that are influenced by them, as that you can be in reaſon obliged to pay any great deference to the authority of a few ſuch names as theſe, in oppoſition to thoſe to which they are here oppoſed?</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, and you will ſay it too truly, though but a few may venture in words to declare for the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of the ſoul and its eternal intereſt, the greater part of mankind do it in their actions. But are the greater part of mankind ſo wiſe, and ſo good, as implicitly to be followed in matters of the higheſt importance? And do not multitudes of theſe declare themſelves on the other ſide, in their moſt ſerious moments? When the intoxications of worldly buſineſs and pleaſures are over, and ſome languiſhing ſickneſs forces men to ſolitude and retirement; what have you generally obſerved to be the effect of ſuch a circumſtance? Have they not then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themſelves convinced of the truth we are now labouring to eſtabliſh? Nay, do we not ſometimes ſee that a diſtemper which ſeizes the mind with violence, yet does not utterly deſtroy its reaſoning faculties, fixes this conviction on the ſoul in a few hours, nay ſometimes in a few moments? Have you never ſeen a gay, thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs creature, ſurprized in the giddy round of pleaſure<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and amuſements, and preſently brought not only to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs, but terror and trembling, by the near view<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <pb n="306" facs="unknown:021060_0319_0FB20C585AEA7CD8"/>
of death? Have you never ſeen the man of buſineſs and care interrupted, like the rich fool in the parable, in the midſt of his ſchemes for the preſent world? And have you not heard one and the other of them owning the vanity of thoſe pleaſures and cares, which but a few days ago, were every thing to them? Confeſſing that religion was the one thing needful, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending it to others with an earneſtneſs, as if they hoped thereby to atone for their own former neglect? We that are miniſters frequently are witneſſes to ſuch things as theſe, and I believe few of our hearers are entire ſtrangers to them.</p>
            <p>And once more, what if, to the teſtimony of the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we could add that of the dead? What if God were to turn aſide the veil which ſeparates between us and the inviſible world, and to permit the moſt careleſs ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the aſſembly to converſe for a few moments with the inhabitants of it? If you were to apply yourſelf to a happy Spirit, that trod the moſt thorny road to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe or paſſed through the moſt fiery trial, and to aſk him, <q>Was it worth your while to labour ſo much, and to endure ſo much for what you now poſſeſs?</q> Surely if the bleſſed in heaven were capable of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, it would move them to hear that it ſhould be made a queſtion. And, on the other hand, if you could enquire of one tormented in that flame below, though he might once be cloathed in purple and fine linen, and fare ſumptuouſly every day, if you could aſk him, <q>Whether his former enjoyments were an equivalent for his preſent ſufferings and deſpair?</q> What anſwer do you ſuppoſe he would return? Perhaps an anſwer of ſo much horror and rage, as you would not be able ſo much as to endure. Or if the malignity of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould prevent him from returning any anſwer at all, ſurely there would be a language even in that ſilence, a language in the darkneſs and flames, and groans of that infernal priſon, which would ſpeak to your very ſoul what the word of God is with equal certainty, though leſs forcible conviction, ſpeaking to your ſoul's ear, that one thing is needful. You ſee it is ſo in the judgment of God the Father, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, of the wiſeſt and beſt of men, of many who ſeemed to judge
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:021060_0320_0FB20C59F10462B8"/>
moſt differently of it, when they came to more delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and ſerious thought, and not only of the dying, but of the dead too, of thoſe who have experimentally known both worlds, and moſt ſurely know what is to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred. But I will not reſt the whole argument here, I add therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. I appeal to the evident reaſons of the caſe itſelf, as it muſt appear to every unprejudiced mind, that the care of the ſoul is indeed the one thing needful.</p>
            <p>I ſtill conſider myſelf as ſpeaking not to Atheiſts, or to Deiſts, but to thoſe who not only believe the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and providence of God, and a future ſtate of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and miſery, but likewiſe who credit the truth of the Chriſtian revelation, as many undoubtedly do who live in a fatal neglect of God and their own ſouls. Now, on theſe principles, a little reflection may be ſufficient to convince you, that it is needful to the preſent repoſe of your own mind, needful, if ever you would ſecure eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs, if ever you would avoid eternal miſery, which will be aggravated, rather than alleviated, by all your preſent enjoyments.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The care of the ſoul is the one thing needful, <q>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe without it you cannot ſecure the peace of your own mind, nor avoid the upbraidings of your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That noble faculty is indeed, as you are often told, the vicegerent of God in the ſoul. 'Tis ſenſible of the dignity and worth of an immortal Spirit, and will ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times cry out of the violence that is offered to it, and cry ſo loud, as to compel the ſinner to hear, whether he will or no. Do you not ſometimes find it yourſelves? When you labour moſt to forget the concerns of your ſoul, do they not ſometimes force themſelves on your remembrance? You are afraid of the reflections of your own mind, but with all your artifice and all your reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, can you entirely avoid them? Does your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence follow you to your beds, even if denied the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of meeting you in your cloſets, and though with an unwelcome voice, there warn you, <q>that your ſoul is neglected, and will quickly be loſt:</q> Does it not follow you to your ſhops and your fields, when you are buſieſt there? Nay I will add, does it not ſometimes
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:021060_0321_0FB20C5C21C8A6B0"/>
follow you to the feaſt, the club, to the dance, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, amidſt all reſiſtance, to the theatre too? Does it not ſometimes mingle your ſweeteſt draught with wormwood, and your gayeſt ſcenes with horror? So that you are like a tradeſman, who, ſuſpecting his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to be in a bad poſture, lays up his books and his papers, yet ſometimes they will come accidentally in his way. He hardly dares to look abroad for fear of meeting a creditor, or an arreſt; and if he labours to forget his cares and his dangers, in a courſe of luxury at home, the remembrance is ſometimes awakened, and the alarm increaſed, by thoſe very extravagancies in which he is attempting to loſe it. Such, no doubt, is the caſe of ſome of your minds, and it is a very painful ſtate, and while things are thus within, external circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances can no more make you happy, than a fine dreſs could relieve you under a violent fit of the ſtone. Whereas, if this great affair were ſecured, you might delight in reflection, as much as you now dread it; and conſcience your bittereſt enemy, would become a delightful friend, and the teſtimony of it your greateſt rejoicing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The care of the ſoul is the one thing needful, <q>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe without it you cannot poſſibly ſecure your eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal happineſs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A crown of everlaſting glory is not ſurely ſuch a trifle as to be thrown away on a careleſs creature, that will not in good earneſt purſue it. God doth not ordinarily deal thus, even with the bounties of his common provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which are comparatively of little value. As to theſe, the hand of the diligent generally makes rich, and he would be thought diſtracted, rather than prudent, who ſhould expect to get an eſtate, merely by wiſhing for it, or without ſome reſolute and continued applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to a proper courſe of action for that purpoſe. Now, that we may not fooliſhly dream of obtaining heaven in, the midſt of a courſe of indolence and ſloth, we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly told in the word of God, that the <hi>kingdom of heaven ſuffers violence, and the violent take it by force</hi> Matt. 11, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. And are therefore exhorted to ſtrive, with the greateſt intenſeneſs, and eagerneſs of mind, as the word properly ſignifies, to enter in at the ſtrait gate, for this great and

important reaſon, <hi>becauſe many ſhall</hi> another day, <hi>ſeek to enter in, and ſhall not be able</hi> Luke 12, 24. Nay, when our Lord makes the moſt gracious promiſes to the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble petitioner, he does it in ſuch a manner as to exclude the hopes of thoſe who are careleſs and indifferent.— <hi>Aſk, and it ſhall be given you; ſeek, and you ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you</hi> Mat. 7, 7. If therefore you do not aſk, ſeek, and knock, the door of mercy will not be opened, and eternal happineſs will be loſt.</p>
            <p>And ſurely if I could ſay no more as to the fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of your neglect, than this, that eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs will be loſt, I ſhould ſay enough to impreſs eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mind that conſiders what eternity means. To fall into a ſtate of everlaſting forgetfulneſs, might indeed appear a refuge to a mind filled with the apprehenſion of future miſery. But, Oh how dreadful a refuge is it! Surely it is ſuch a refuge as a vaſt precipice, from which a man falling, would be daſhed to pieces in a moment, might appear to a perſon purſued by the officers of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that he might be brought out to a painful and lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering execution. If an extravagant youth would have reaſon to look round with auguiſh on ſome fair and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple paternal inheritance, which he had ſold or forfeited merely for the riot of a few days: how much more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy would it be for a rational mind to think that its eternal happineſs is loſt for any earthly conſideration whatever. Tormenting thought! had I attended to the one thing which I have neglected, I might have been great and happy, beyond expreſſion, beyond conception. Not merely for the little ſpan of ten thouſand thouſand ages, but FOR EVER. So that the moment would have come, when, if it had been aſked concerning me, <q>How long has that glorious Spirit been an inhabitant of heaven? How long has it been enjoying God, and its ſelf in that ſtate of perfection?</q> The anſwer would have been ſuch, that no line of any determinate finite length would have been ſufficient to have contained the number of ages, no time can be aſſigned ſufficient to figure them down. This is eternity, but I have loſt it, and am now on the verge of being. This lamp, which might have outlaſted thoſe of the firmament, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be extinguiſhed, and I blotted out from amongſt
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:021060_0323_0FB20C60EC65D458"/>
the works of God, and cut off from all the bounties of his hand. Would not this be a very miſerable caſe, if this were all? And would it not be ſufficient to prove this to be the better part, which, as our Lord obſerves, can never be taken away? But, God forbid, that we ſhould be ſo unfaithful to him, and to the ſouls of men, as to reſt in ſuch a repreſentation alone. I therefore add once more.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The care of the ſoul is the one thing needful, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe without it, you cannot avoid a ſtate of eternal miſery, which will be aggravated, rather than alleviated by all your preſent enjoyments.</p>
            <p>Nothing can be more evident from the word of the God of truth. It there plainly appears to be a deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined caſe which leaves no room for a more favourable conjecture or hope. The wicked ſhall be turned into hell, even all the nations that forget God. They ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment, into a ſtate where they ſhall in vain wiſh for death, and ſhall not be able to find it. Oh! ſirs, 'tis a certain, but an awful truth, that your ſouls will be thinking and immortal beings, even in ſpight of themſelves. They may indeed tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but they cannot deſtroy themſelves. They can no more ſuſpend their power, thought and perception, than a mirrour its property of reflecting rays that fall on its ſurface. Do you ſuſpect the contrary? Make the trial immediately. Command your minds to ceaſe from thinking but for one quarter of an hour, or for half that time, and exclude every idea and every reflection. Can you ſucceed in that attempt? Or rather, does not thought preſs in with a more ſenſible violence on that reſiſtence, as anxious deſire to ſleep, makes us ſo much the more wakeful. Thus, will thought follow you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the grave, thus will it, as an unwelcome gueſt, force itſelf upon you, when it can ſerve only to perplex and diſtreſs the mind. It will for ever upbraid you, that, notwithſtanding all the kind remonſtrances of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and the pleadings of the blood of Chriſt, you have gone on in your folly, till heaven is loſt, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation incurred; and all for what? for a ſhadow and a dream.</p>
            <p>Oh think not, ſinners, that the remembrance of your
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:021060_0324_0FB20C62E3D460E8"/>
paſt pleaſures, of your ſucceſs in your other cares whilſt that of the one thing needful was forgotten think not that this will eaſe your minds. It will rather torment them the more. Son, remember that thou in thy life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time receivedſt thy good things. Bitter remembrance! Well might the heathen poets repreſent the unhappy ſpirits in ſhades below, as eagerly catching at the water of forgetfulneſs, yet unable to reach it. Your preſent comforts will only ſerve to give you a livelier ſenſe of your miſery, as having taſted ſuch degrees of enjoyment; and to inflame the reckoning, as you have miſimproved thoſe talents lodged in your hands for better purpoſes. Surely if theſe things were believed, and ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, the ſinner would have no more heart to rejoice in his preſent proſperity, than a man would have to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe himſelf with the curioſities of a fine garden, through which he was led to be broke upon the rack.</p>
            <p>But I will enlarge no further upon theſe things.— Would to God that the unaccountable ſtupidity of mens minds, and their fatal attachment to the pleaſures and cares of the preſent life, did not make it neceſſary to inſiſt on them ſo frequently and ſo copiouſly!</p>
            <p n="4">IV. I proceed to the reflections which naturally ariſe from hence, and ſhall only mention two.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How much reaſon have we to lament the folly of mankind, in neglecting the one thing needful.</p>
            <p>If religion be indeed the trueſt wiſdom, then ſurely we have the juſteſt reaſon to ſay with Solomon, that folly and madneſs is in mens hearts. Is it the one thing needful? Look on the conduct of the generality of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and you would imagine they thought it the one thing needleſs: the vaineſt dream, and the idleſt amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the mind. God is admoniſhing them by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and providences, ſometimes by ſuch as are moſt awful, to lay it to heart: he ſpeaks once, yea twice, yea a multitude of times, but man regards it not. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs perhaps to believe all that I have been ſaying, but act as if the contrary were ſelf-evident; they will riſk theſe ſouls and this eternity, for a thing of nought, for that for the ſake of which they would not riſk ſo much as a hand or a finger, or a joint, no, nor perhaps a toy that adorns it. Surely this is the wonder of angels, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:021060_0325_0FB20C6464DAD468"/>
of devils too, unleſs the obſervation of ſo many ages may have rendered it familiar to both. And can we my Chriſtian brethren, behold ſuch a ſcene with indifference? If ſome epidemical madneſs had ſeized our country, or the places where we live, ſo that as we went from one place to another, we ſhould every where meet with lunaticks, and ſee amongſt the reſt, ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of the fineſt genius and improvements, and the moſt eminent ſtateſmen of life, amuſing themſelves with ſtraws and bubbles, or wounding themſelves and others; ſurely were we ever ſo ſecure from the danger of infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or aſſault, the ſight would cut us to the heart. Surely a good natured man would hardly be able to go abroad, or even be deſirous to live amongſt ſo many ſad ſpectacles. Yet theſe poor creatures might, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this, be the children of God, and the higher their frenzy roſe, the nearer might their complete hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs be. But, alas, the greater part of mankind are ſeized with a worſe kind of madneſs, in which they are ruining their ſouls: and can we behold it with indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference! The Lord awaken our compaſſion, our prayers, and our endeavours, in dependence on divine grace, that we may be inſtrumental in bringing them to their right mind, and making them wiſe indeed, that is, wiſe to ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. How neceſſary is it that we ſhould ſeriouſly inquire how this one thing needful is regarded by us!</p>
            <p>Let me intreat you to remember your own concern in it, and inquire—Have I thought ſeriouſly of it?— Have I ſeen the importance of it?—Has it lain with a due and an abiding weight on my mind?—Has it brought me to Chriſt, that I might lay the ſtreſs of theſe great eternal intereſts on him? And am I acting in the main of my life as one that has theſe convictions?—Am I willing in fact to give up other things, my intereſts, my pleaſures, my paſſions to this?—Am I converſing with God and with man, as one that believes theſe things, as one that has deliberately choſen the better part, and is determined to abide by that choice?</p>
            <p>Obſerve the anſwer which conſcience returns to theſe inquiries and you will know your own part in that more particular application, with which I am to conclude my diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="313" facs="unknown:021060_0326_0FB20C65E33588D8"/>1. Let me addreſs myſelf to thoſe that are entirely unconcerned about the one thing needful.</p>
            <p>Sirs, I have been ſtating the caſe at large, and now I appeal to your conſciences, are theſe things ſo? or are they not? God and your own hearts beſt know for what the care of your ſoul is neglected; but be it what it will, the difference between one grain of ſand, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother is not great, when it comes to be weighed againſt a talent of gold. Whatever it is, you had need to examine it carefully. You had need to view that commodity on all ſides, of which you do in effect ſay, for this will I ſell my ſoul, for this will I give up heaven and venture hell, be heaven and hell whatever they may. In the name of God, ſirs, is this the part of a man, of a rational creature? To go on with your eyes open towards a pit of eternal ruin, becauſe there are a few gay flowers in the way. Or what if you ſhut your eyes? will that prevent your fall? It ſignifies little to ſay, I will not think of theſe things, I will not conſider them. God has ſaid, In the laſt days they ſhall conſider it perfectly. The revels of a drunken malefactor will not prevent, nor reſpite his execution. Pardon my plainneſs, if it were a fable or a tale, I would endeavour to amuſe you with words, but I cannot do it where your ſouls are at ſtake.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I would apply to thoſe who are convinced of the importance of their ſouls, yet are inclined to defer that care of them a little longer, which, in the general, they ſee to be neceſſary.</p>
            <p>I know you that are young, are under peculiar temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to do this; though it is ſtrange that the death of ſo many of your companions ſhould not be an anſwer to ſome of the moſt ſpecious and dangerous of thoſe temptations. Methinks if there were the leaſt degree of uncertainty, the importance is too weighty to put matters to the venture. But here the uncertainty is great and apparent. You muſt ſurely know that there are critical ſeaſons of life for managing the concerns of it, which are of ſuch a nature, that if once loſt, they may never return: here is a critical ſeaſon. Now is the accepted time, now is the day of ſalvation. To-day if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts. This
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:021060_0327_0FB20C68B9E3BF78"/>
language may not be ſpoken to-morrow. Talk not of a more convenient ſeaſon, none can be more convenient; and, that to which you would probably refer it, is leaſt of all ſo. A dying time. You would not chuſe then to have any important buſineſs in hand; and will you of choice refer the greateſt buſineſs of all to that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, hurrying, amazing hour? If a friend were then to come to you with the balance of an intricate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, or a view of a title to an eſtate, you would ſhake your fainting head, and lift up your pale trembling hand, and ſay perhaps with a feeble voice, <q>alas, is this a time for theſe things!</q> And is it a time for ſo much greater things than theſe! I wiſh you knew, and would conſider in what a ſtrait we that are miniſters are ſometimes brought, when we are called to the dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beds of thoſe who have ſpent their lives in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of the one thing needful. On the other hand, we fear leaſt, if we palliate matters, and ſpeak ſmooth things, we ſhall betray and ruin their ſouls; and, on the other hand, that if we uſe a becoming plainneſs and ſeriouſneſs, in warning them of their danger, we ſhall quite overwhelm them, and haſten the dying moment, which is advancing by ſuch ſteps. Oh let me intreat you for our ſakes, and much more for your own, that you do not drive us to ſuch ſad extremities; but that if you are convinced, as I hope ſome of you may now be, that the care of the ſoul is that needful thing we have repreſented, let the conviction work, let it drive you immediately to the throne of grace, that from thence you may derive that wiſdom and ſtrength which may direct you in all the intricacies which intangle you, and animate you in the midſt of difficulty and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I would, in the laſt place, addreſs myſelf to thoſe happy ſouls who have in good earneſt attended to the one thing needful.</p>
            <p>I hope when you ſee how commonly it is neglected, neglected indeed by many, whoſe natural capacities, improvements, and circumſtances in life, appear to you ſuperior to your own, you will humbly acknowledge, that it was diſtinguiſhing grace that brought you into this happy ſtate, and formed you to this moſt neceſſary
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:021060_0328_0FB20C6A90EE3698"/>
care. Bleſs the Lord, therefore, who hath given you that counſel, in virtue of which you can ſay, that he is your portion.—Rejoice in the thought, that the great concern is ſecured; as it is natural for us to do, when ſome important affair is diſpatched which has long lain before us, and which we have been inclined to put off from one day to another, but have at length ſtrenuouſly and ſucceſsfully attended.—Remember ſtill to continue acting on theſe great principles which at firſt determined your choice; and ſeriouſly conſider, that thoſe who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire their life may at laſt be given them for a prey, muſt continue on their guard, in all ſtages of their journey through a wilderneſs, where daily dangers are ſtill ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding them. Having ſecured the great concern, make yourſelves eaſy as to others of ſmaller importance. You have choſen the kingdom of God, and his righteouſneſs, other things therefore ſhall be added unto you; and if any which you deſire ſhould not be added, comfort your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with this thought, that you have the good part which can never be taken away. And, not to enlarge on theſe obvious hints, which muſt ſo often occur, be very ſolicitous that others may be brought to a care a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the one thing needful. If it be needful for you, it is for your children, your friends, your ſervants. Let them therefore ſee your concern in this reſpect for them, as well as for yourſelves. Let parents, eſpecially, attend to this exhortation, whoſe care for their offſpring often exceeds in other reſpects, and fails in this. Remember that your children may never live to enjoy the effects of your labour and concern, to get them eſtates and portions. The charges of their funerals may perhaps be all their ſhare of what you are ſo anxiouſly careful to lay up for them. And, oh! think what a ſword would pierce through your very heart, if you ſhould ſtand by the corps of a beloved child with this reflection, <q>This poor creature has done with life, before it learnt its great buſineſs in it, and is gone to eternity, which I have been ſeldom warning it to prepare for, and which perhaps it learnt of me to forget</q>.</p>
            <p>On the whole, may this grand care be awakened to thoſe by whom it has hitherto been neglected; may it be revived in each of o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> minds. And that you may be
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:021060_0329_0FB20C6C80594778"/>
encouraged to purſue it with greater chearfulneſs, let me conclude with this comfortable thought, that in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the neceſſity of the caſe, is the proviſion which divine grace has made for our aſſiſtance. If you are diſpoſed to ſit down at Chriſt's feet, he will teach you by his word and ſpirit. If you commit this precious jewel, which is your eternal all, into his hand, he will preſerve it unto that day, and will then produce it richly adorned, and gloriouſly improved to his own honour, and to your everlaſting joy. <hi>Amen.</hi>
