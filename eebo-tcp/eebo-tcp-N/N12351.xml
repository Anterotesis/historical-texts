            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Work which I offer to the Public, being of an extraordinary kind for a woman's pen, it is neceſſary to ſay what gave occaſion to it.</p>
            <p>About two years ſince, having a converſation with a clergyman of my acquaintance concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preaching in general, he, betwixt jeſt and earneſt, declared he would preach any ſermon which I would write. An agreement was made, and I ſat down to compoſe.</p>
            <p>As I had always looked on perſons of a covetous diſpoſition with a mixture of pity and indignation, and having met with many of a contracted, narrow turn of mind, and very few who anſwered my idea of generoſity, the text which had occurred on ſeveral occaſions, when I could have wiſhed not to have had reaſon for it, preſented itſelf now, and I pitched on that as a ſubject on which I might expreſs my thoughts.</p>
            <p>Some accidental circumſtances prevented its being preached: but having once entered on
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:015584_0005_0F998EE35C838B98"/>
that kind of writing, I could not help commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to paper ſome thoughts which had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently paſſed over my mind on the inſufficiency of this life for real happineſs, and the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of all that wore that appearance. On this occaſion I expatiated on the words of Job; a book which I had always read with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and melancholy pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The Sermon on Revenge is compoſed of arguments which I had often made uſe of to calm the ſpirit of retaliation, which I have found riſing in my breaſt, on my having met with unkind treatment where I thought I had not deſerved, and had no reaſon to expect it.</p>
            <p>Theſe three diſcourſes lay by me a long while without my thinking much about them; till having mentioned to a friend a deſire I had of turning to ſome public advantage what I had written, he told me the thought was not amiſs, but they were too few to publiſh alone, and adviſed me to write four more.</p>
            <p>I choſe thoſe ſubjects on which I had moſt reflected, and on which therefore I had moſt to ſay. The terrible conſequences of Slander to defenceleſs Women, and the extreme cruelty of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015584_0006_0F998EE42C02C110"/>
the practice againſt thoſe, who generally labour under evils ſufficient to embitter life without that addition, had often employed my thoughts; and the equitable admonition of Our Saviour, delivered in that admirable ſermon which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the moſt perfect rule of life that ever was given to man, appeared to me a proper text, and therefore conſtituted the ſubject of the fourth eſſay.</p>
            <p>As the uſual conſequence of having my ſpirits too much raiſed has been the feeling them alſo too greatly depreſſed, I had often, on thoſe occaſions, quoted to myſelf the words of Solomon, which I have now fixed on as a topic for the fifth eſſay. I have always entertained the higheſt notion of filial duty, which I think is lately grown too little the faſhion; and this furniſhes me with matter for another. The ſeventh was the hint of a friend, who is herſelf a mother, and whoſe partiality to my judgment made her deſirous to know if my opinion coincided with her own in the article of education.</p>
            <p>I hope this account will prevent my being accuſed of vanity in endeavouring to reform mankind. I really never had ſuch a thought: but if I can be at all beneficial to that part of it
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015584_0007_0F998EE4E72339E0"/>
to which I belong, among whom there are ſome who will not diſdain to take advice from a female writer, I ſhall eſteem myſelf happy to be able to conduce to their amuſement or improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The very young, whoſe minds are not yet formed, and who are ſtartled at the idea of reading a ſermon, may, through the novelty of theſe, be induced to peruſe, and may poſſibly learn ſome uſeful leſſons from them.</p>
            <p>As a farther apology, let me obſerve that political diſputes now employ the tongues and pens of almoſt all degrees of men, as well clergy as laity, ſo that they have no time to think of any thing elſe. The rage of public virtue is ſo great, that private virtue is almoſt forgotten. When patriotiſm and royaliſm engage all the wits of the age, it is no wonder that a Woman ſhould take the lower department, and venture to write moral eſſays. The candid will remember that it is the work of a Woman, and will not be very ſevere in their criticiſm; the cenſure of others I am not ſolicitous to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precate, as I think too highly of the Public to ſuppoſe it can influence their judgment.</p>

            <head>AGAINST COVETOUSNESS.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>MATTHEW. xix. 24.</bibl>
               <q>I ſay unto you, it is eaſier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of Heaven.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS is a hard ſaying, and might well give occaſion to the queſtion put to our Saviour, by his diſciples, of, Who then can be ſaved? However, if we examine a little farther, I think I ſhall prove that no impoſſibility is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by theſe words: in order to this, let us recollect to whom, and on what account, they were ſpoken. A young gentleman of large fortune, who had been a ſtrict obſerver of the Jewiſh law, who was conſcious of having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged himſelf juſtly in his dealings with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, indeed, one who does not ſeem to have been deficient in any point of moral duty, yet found ſomething wanting in himſelf, and was ſenſible he had done nothing which could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure him eternal life. Under this conviction he applied to our Saviour, hoping he might
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015584_0009_0F998EE658C7B448"/>
find ſomething in the new religion which might ſet his mind at reſt with regard to a future ſtate; flattering himſelf, perhaps, that the compliance with a few external ceremonies would ſecure him everlaſting felicity: but how thunderſtruck was he, when the Great Founder of our faith demanded the ſurrender of all his goods to the poor, and promiſed him treaſure in heaven, on no other terms than the parting with what he poſſeſſed on earth. But here it may be aſked, If the rich man could not have been a worthy member of Chriſtianity without ſo great a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice? To which I anſwer, that in thoſe early times I think ſuch a ſacrifice was abſolutely neceſſary: our bleſſed Saviour conſtantly taught his diſciples a contempt for all ſublunary riches and honours; he often repeated to them that his kingdom was not of this world: that if they would be his diſciples indeed, they muſt ſubmit to poverty and diſgrace; muſt be ſtrangers and pilgrims on earth, as became the followers of a maſter who had no place to lay his head, and who was ſo poor as not to be able to pay the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute due unto Caeſar without the aſſiſtance of a miracle. Our Lord knew the oppoſition a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo contrary to worldly wiſdom muſt naturally meet with: he knew that the propagators of it
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:015584_0010_0F998EEA916B03D0"/>
would be afflicted, tormented, perſecuted, and even ſuffer death for his name's ſake: "Think not, ſays he, I am come to ſend peace on earth, I am come to ſend a ſword;" for that he knew would be the conſequence of man's perverſeneſs and diſobedience. It was incumbent then on men who were to be ſubject to the cruelty and malice of the world; who were to ſit looſe to all earthly enjoyments, and to be ready to lay down their lives, whenever they were called for, rather than renounce their faith; to have their minds diſengaged from all lower concerns, and and their hearts fixed upon an incorruptible treaſure, which it was not in the power of any earthly potentate either to deſtroy or diminiſh.</p>
            <p>Thus much is, I think, ſufficient to prove, that it muſt have been a great impediment to the progreſs of the goſpel, if the firſt preacher of it had been wealthy: beſides which, it is not unreaſonable to ſuppoſe, that the Son of God, the Great ſearcher of hearts, plainly ſaw that this young man's was too contracted to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the extenſive benevolence, and unbounded liberality, which are the great principles of the chriſtian inſtitution, and without which religion is no more than a name: he was ſtrictly juſt;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:015584_0011_0F998EEBE34D8190"/>
but what merit could he claim from that? born, as he was, to large poſſeſſions, what temptation had he to injure his neighbour either by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or fraud? That there are oppreſſive rich ones I confeſs; but they are ſo far from deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the title of Chriſtians, that they are not worthy of that of men, but may be juſtly looked on as infernal ſpirits in human ſhape, who are ſuffered for a time to indulge their evil inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by being the peſts of ſociety; but it is to be hoped ſuch characters are very ſcarce.</p>
            <p>The generality of the world think they have diſcharged their duty towards their neighbour, if they have never invaded another's property, and look upon it they have an undoubted right to keep what they call their own by inheritance or acquiſition to their own uſe. Unhappy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion! fatal error! produced by the love of gold; the man who inherits an affluent fortune, while he ſees multitudes around him pining in want of the neceſſaries of life, for multitudes ſuch he muſt ſee (unleſs he wilfully ſhuts his eyes) ought to look up to heaven with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt gratitude, who has not only placed him above the miſeries of dependance, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving obligations, which are too often confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

of death their awakened conſciences never fail to tell them how miſerably they have been deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and they wiſh, though then, alas! ſuch wiſhes are in vain, that they had ſome few deeds of real charity to cover their many faults, and plead for them at the throne of mercy.</p>
            <p>Men of acquired fortunes have generally very plauſible reaſons for not being generous: we have earned our money with the ſweat of our brows, ſay they, ſurely we have a right to enjoy it likewiſe; the induſtrious never fail of ſucceſs, and indolence is the only parent of want. Tho' this may be often true, yet it is far from being a general rule: let the proſperous man abate a little of his ſelf-ſufficiency, and recollect, and he will find that his ſucceſs has not been owing merely to his own induſtry, but has generally been aided by ſome lucky chance; ſome kind aſſiſting friends, guided by providence, has led him forward, which others of equal merit have not been able to find; let him not then arrogate too much to himſelf, nor too ſeverely cenſure the leſs fortunate, or always charge their ill fortune to their ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, but rather let him, as becomes a man and a Chriſtian, endeavour to alleviate the diſtreſſes
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015584_0014_0F998EEF678F6548"/>
which the unkindneſs of the world; joined to their own errors, may have brought upon them, to aſſiſt them with his advice, his intereſt, or his purſe, as occaſion requires; and raiſe to cheerful induſtry, by the proſpect of reward, the mind which frequent diſappointment has ſunk to inactivity and dejection.</p>
            <p>It is to be lamented that perſons of high rank, whoſe fortunes enable them to relieve the poor and diſtreſſed, are ſo far removed above want themſelves, and ſo little accuſtomed to the ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in others, that they ſeldom think of or feel for it properly; while the man of liberal heart and narrow circumſtances is often wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſights of woe, which, as it is utterly out of his power to alleviate by any thing more than a pitying tear, ſerves only to give unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary pain, and make him regret the want of ability to do that which, perhaps, had provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence bleſſed him with, he might have neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo ſeldom do riches and liberality meet. It is true, there is a kind of faſhionable charity ſubſiſting among us, and it is no uncommon thing to hear that a certain noble perſonage has ordered a certain ſum of money to be laid out in proviſions, and diſtributed among the poor:—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:015584_0015_0F998EF01CAE1A20"/>
This is generally mentioned with great enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums in the news-papers as a laudable example for others to follow: That it is truly laudable to provide for the neceſſities of the induſtrious la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer, far be it from me to deny; but there are a ſet of unhappy people, whoſe lot is caſt above the loweſt ſort, and yet want the comforts which even they enjoy. Aſhamed to beg, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to dig, theſe I recommend as proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects for the rich to exerciſe their generoſity on: let them ſeek them in their obſcurity, and they will find families whom they may make happy by ſums ſo inconſiderable as by themſelves to be ſcarcely miſſed; they will there find worthy people have been reduced to poverty by unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and unforeſeen misfortunes, and unable to bear up againſt them for want of the aſſiſtance of friends and money; ſome who have owed their ruin to their own goodneſs of heart, whoſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous, unſuſpecting natures have been impoſed upon by artful and deſigning men; ſuch as theſe who have erred through exceſs of virtue, have certainly a claim which no liberal mind can refuſe; and many may be likewiſe found whoſe ſufferings have been owing to their own follies; yet ſufferings ſtill they are, and they who feel the weight of them have a right to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015584_0016_0F998EF0DDB796F8"/>
pity and relief from creatures who are not themſelves exempt from the failings of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Indeed, I know not how to believe there are any people ſo void of tenderneſs and compaſſion, as to upbraid a man for indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, at the time he is feeling their dreadful conſequences. Can there be a more pitiable object, than the father of a family who ſees his children around him deſtitute of ſupport, and muſt reproach himſelf as the cauſe? and can there be a greater act of generoſity than to alleviate ſuch diſtreſs, by putting it in his power to retrieve paſt errors, and provide for the innocent ſharers of his condition?</p>
            <p>May the Almighty Diſpoſer of all events in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline the hearts of all who abound in this world's wealth to ſuch true benevolence; the reflections on ſuch actions will give comfort at the hour of death, when all worldly riches ſhall ceaſe to afford any: and our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour has plainly told us, that feeding the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, clothing the naked, viſiting the ſick, comforting the afflicted, are the only works that ſhall ſtand us in any ſtead at the great day of judgment.

            <head>ON THE VANITY OF THIS LIFE.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>JOB xix. 26.</bibl>
               <q>For though after this life worms deſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE were the words of Job at a time when he ſeems to have loſt all hopes of earthly happineſs, and to have fixed his thoughts only on ſomething beyond the grave, as appears from many paſſages in the foregoing chapters; where he, in the moſt pathetic terms, laments his forlorn condition. "My face is foul with weeping, ſaith he; my eye alſo, by reaſon of my ſorrow, is dim; and on my eyelids is the ſhadow of death."</p>
            <p>He then enumerates his uncommon misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, till too much diſpirited with the ſad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection to plead any longer againſt the unjuſt reproaches of his friends, he implores their pity, in ſuch a moving though ſhort ſentence, that had they not been the moſt unfeeling of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015584_0018_0F998EF2721D5C68"/>
men, they would have ceaſed to perſecute him who ſeemed already but too ſenſible of having, though he knew not for what cauſe, fallen under the diſpleaſure of the Almighty.</p>
            <p>He next declares his deſpair of being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than miſerable in this world, and looks forward to the end of life as the only end of his ſorrow. "My breath is corrupt, ſaith he, my days are extinct, the grave is ready for me:" but comforts himſelf with the certain aſſurance that he ſhall one day renew his life, and be made ample amends for his paſt ſufferings, by the everlaſting ſociety of his Redeemer. This is what he means by thoſe words, "I know that my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the laſt day on the earth: and though, after this life, worms deſtroy my body, yet in my fleſh ſhall I ſee God.</p>
            <p>In diſcourſing on this text, I mean, firſt, to ſhew the folly of looking on any thing in this world as permanent enough to engage our affections: next, to prove the certainty of a future ſtate; and, laſtly, to conclude with an exhortation to ſuch a life as will afford us comfort at the approach of eternity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:015584_0019_0F998EF31AAE4AB0"/>
Surely, if ever any man had reaſon to think his happineſs fixed on a certain duration, it was Job, who was born to a princely fortune, of conſequence ſufficient to be courted by the nobles of the land, who conſulted him as their oracle, and hung with ſilent admiration and reſpect on the eloquence of his words. The mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, whoſe wants his bounteous hand ſupplied, followed him as he paſſed; every tongue bleſſed him, and every eye melting with gratitude, expreſſed the joy which filled the heart.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed with a numerous progeny, he looked forward with the hope of ſeeing his days renewed in his children, nor was he unmindful of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all good, who had beſtowed ſo large a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it on him; but expreſſed his thanks in a manner that was moſt pleaſing to his God, by admitting others to ſhare it largely with him: yet, contrary to all expectation, was this great good man ſuddenly thrown down from the height of human glory to the loweſt depth of miſery: deprived of his children, his fortune, and his health: left deſtitute of every comfort; and what made it the more terrible was, that he had no time to prepare for this ſad change, for it happened on a day
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015584_0020_0F998EF3D8EE5EB8"/>
of feaſting, when his whole family had given a looſe to mirth and feſtivity, without the leaſt apprehenſions of the deſtruction which ſo ſoon fell on them. Such complicated woe, we ſhould imagine too much for man to ſuſtain, did not this inſtance of Job's ſhew us to what height that fortitude, which is ſupported by a good conſcience, can carry us; for though on the firſt ſhock of his calamities he burſts into ſome paſſionate exclamations; and, provoked by the cruelty of his friends, who under the pretence of comfort and advice (as is too often the caſe) inſulted his diſtreſs, he, with ſome appearance of reſentment, vindicates his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured reputation againſt their unkind aſperſions: yet with what patient humility does he reſign himſelf to the Almighty; and, conſcious that the righteous God, whoſe laws had been the conſtant rule of his life, would never totally abandon him, he rejoices in the certainty of meeting with that tranquillity in another world which had fled from him in this.</p>
            <p>But as few, if any, among the ſons of men are endowed with virtue ſuch as Job's, which was proof againſt the temptations that ariſe from the greateſt proſperity, as well as the loweſt
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:015584_0021_0F998EF4EFBF5BB0"/>
adverſity, ſo I believe none ever met with ſuch ſevere trials. Yet are there many, "who (as the author of my text moſt emphatically ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes it) die in the bitterneſs of their ſouls, and never eat with pleaſure." This may be truly ſaid of thoſe who are always ſubject to ſome cruel bodily infirmities; whoſe whole life may be properly called a lingering death, till, waſted with pain they ſink into the grave, and their eyes never ſee good.</p>
            <p>But I will not dwell upon this melancholy repreſentation of man, in a ſtate of ſickneſs, but conſider him as bleſt with health and ſtrength; yet among thoſe there are many who ſeem born only to misfortune, whoſe waking hours are ſpent in labour, and ſlumbers bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with anxious ſolicitude, to obtain a ſcanty ſubſiſtance, with the additional mortification of ſeeing their hopes blaſted, their ſchemes fruſtrated and others leſs worthy, though more ſucceſsful, preferred to thoſe poſts of honour and advantage which ought to have been the juſt reward of merit. Add to this, the open dangers, as well as ſecret ſnares, to which our condition in this life makes us liable. From the cruel effects of malevolence and ill-will what
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:015584_0022_0F998EF5906A2600"/>
man is ſecure? and one deadly ſtroke from the hand of a powerful enemy may cruſh him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the hope of ever riſing more. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary and unſuſpecting mind is often made the dupe of the crafty and deſigning, who, under the diſguiſe of friendſhip, a profeſſion by which the uncorrupted heart may eaſily be deceived, have betrayed it to irremediable ruin.</p>
            <p>I will only touch upon one evil more, inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to mankind; I mean the irreparable loſs of friends by death: for ever to part with thoſe who have ſhared with us our pleaſures and our pains; to whom, as to a ſecond ſelf, we have confided our moſt ſecret thoughts: to recollect pleaſing converſations, embittered with the ſad remembrance that they can no more return: to look back on paſt ſcenes, enjoyed with thoſe whoſe deareſt connexions death has diſſolved: to reflect, I ſay, on thoſe, and with calmneſs, requires a fortitude that is more, or an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that is leſs, than human. Philoſophy, which often ſerves as a pompous name under which to cover the want of feeling, may in vain pretend to ſupport; but the man whoſe heart is capable of forming ſuch tender ties, will find all the aid of religion neceſſary to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:015584_0023_0F998EF6C8E93448"/>
him in theſe common, yet not on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, leſs heavy afflictions.</p>
            <p>Since then daily experience convinces us, that it is utterly out of our power to ſecure to ourſelves the poſſeſſion of any thing the moſt dear to us; "ſince riches make themſelves wings and flee away;" ſince fame is a bubble which depends on the caprice of men, who are to-day loud in our praiſes, and loading us with honours, and to-morrow, with equal warmth, endeavouring to cover us with infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; let us not lay any ſtreſs upon ſuch uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain goods. What then, will ye ſay, did that God, whoſe chief attribute is mercy, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate us only to be wretched? Did he give us deſires after happineſs, only to laugh at our vain ſearch for what can never be found? Are ſuch notions ſuitable to the idea of a wiſe and good being? No ſurely; let us not for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment entertain thoughts ſo unworthy of the Deity; but let us reſt aſſured, that there will be a time when all the diſpenſations of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which now appear ſo incomprehenſible to our ſhort-ſighted though boaſted reaſon, ſhall be fully cleared, and the goodneſs and wiſdom of God be made manifeſt in all his
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:015584_0024_0F998EF6D87F9B40"/>
works: then ſhall all thoſe who, like Job, have retained their integrity under the preſſure of undeſerved calamities, be made companions of their redeemer, and their God, to all eternity.</p>
            <p>Let us then, in order to fit ourſelves for ſuch ſociety, diveſt our minds of all thoſe tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent and unruly paſſions which trouble our repoſe in this life, and muſt infallibly prevent our happineſs in another. He who is full of the inward horrors of envy, hatred, or revenge, can never be partaker of love, peace, and calm tranquillity with angels, "and the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect:" nor can the voluptuous man, whoſe ſoul can riſe no higher than ſenſual pleaſures, be happy in thoſe regions of purity. In like manner muſt the miſer part with his love of gold, "for no one can ſerve God and mammon," if he wiſhes to be a ſharer of that incorruptable treaſure, "eternal in the heavens; where neither moth nor ruſt doth corrupt, and where thieves can never break through and ſteal."</p>
            <p>May the Almighty Diſpoſer of all events teach us to prefer a happy eternity to this ſhort fleeting life; "and may we paſs through things temporal, ſo that we finally loſe not the things eternal," through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

us the loweſt and vileſt of mankind are capable of attaining. Our minds are naturally led to reſent ill uſage; and even the Jews, the people choſen of God, to whom he deigned to reveal his will in a more particular manner than to the reſt of the world, were but very imperfect practitioners of this duty of forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: nay, we find amongſt the beſt of them ſome very unjuſtifiable inſtances of revenge; and the moſt that any one could arrive at was not to return evil for evil: but the Godlike act of returning good for evil, of bleſſing our enemy when he curſed us, of feeding him when hungry, and ſupplying him with drink when dry, was too great a maſtery over the paſſions for human nature, unaſſiſted, ever to arrive at.</p>
            <p>Nor would (I may venture to affirm) the poſitive command of God himſelf, forbidding revenge, have been ſufficient to reſtrain crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſo prone to it, had not our Bleſſed Saviour condeſcended ſo far to our weakneſs as to be our companion here on earth, and not only to enjoin this great duty by precept, but was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the moſt perfect pattern of a meek and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving ſpirit that the world ever ſaw. Who as
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:015584_0027_0F998EFE08D98C78"/>
the friend of mankind, went about doing good: he adminiſtered to our temporal wants; he heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our infirmities, and recommended to our practice a religion which, if followed, will as undoubtedly conduce to our peace and happineſs in this ſtate, as it will moſt aſſuredly procure it for us in one eternal. What return did an ungrateful and unfeeling world make to ſuch invaluable favours?</p>
            <p>Why, they fed on his bounty, and then forgot the miraculous hand that had beſtowed it on them: they were healed by his ſovereign touch, and then, with a ſtrange and unheard of baſeneſs, aſcribed his power to ſorcery and enchantment: and at length, to crown all, and to carry their hatred as far as poſſible, they ſeized on their benefactor, their Redeemer, and their God; and, with ſacrilegious hands, put him to the moſt painful and ignominious death: yet, at the moment that he ſubmitted to their unjuſt decree, boundleſs as his power was, when he could in an inſtant have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded fire from heaven to have deſtroyed his enemies, he prayed for them to his Father, alleviating their guilt, by imputing it to their ignorance.</p>

               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:015584_0028_0F998EFE81B93150"/>
I particularly addreſs myſelf to thoſe whoſe nice ſenſibility has been wounded by undeſerved reproach; thoſe whoſe delicate feelings have been rouſed by the ſharp ſting of ingratitude, and let them tell me if they do not find their injuries leſſen, and their reſentments vaniſh, in the contemplation of what their Lord endured for their ſakes?</p>
            <p>In the day of adverſity his moſt intimate friends and followers forſook him and fled; and he, who had been diſtinguiſhed by marks of particular kindneſs, and who, but a few hours before, had repeatedly declared he would die with him, denied even the knowledge of him. None ever had it in their power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play ſuch ſtriking marks of the virtue of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, becauſe none ever received ſo many and ſo great injuries, as he who is ſaid "to have been deſpiſed and rejected of his brethren, a man of ſorrows and acquainted with grief."</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding this great example, which was deſigned for our imitation, ſuch is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>It will certainly be allowed that the moſt juſt among us are inclinable to judge well of themſelves; and the more merit any one thinks he has, the greater appears the injury that he thinks has been done him; and when his imagination is heated by a ſenſe of wrong, I am afraid he will not be quite equitable in his vengeance. Another reaſon againſt purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing revenge is, that we do not no where it will ſtop: for the man who could, unprovoked, do us an injury, will certainly not be juſt enough to ſubmit to our puniſhments, but will take the firſt opportunity of returning it; this will call for a ſecond revenge: thus we ſhall be engaged in a ſtate of continual hoſtilities, and, inſtead of mutual good offices, our time will be ſpent in a retaliation of injuries.</p>

               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:015584_0030_0F998EFFE076B6F8"/>
It is certainly the intereſt of every man to uſe his utmoſt endeavours to eradicate this turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent unruly paſſion from his breaſt: for I know not which to ſay is the moſt pitiable object, he who broods over his wrongs, lamenting his want of power to revenge; or he who pleaſes himſelf with the diabolical and ſhort-lived ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of rendering his enemy as unhappy as himſelf: but undoubtedly they may both be ſaid to carry a hell in their boſom.</p>
            <p>I am convinced men would want few perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſives to forgiveneſs, if they righly conſidered the imperfection of human nature; how liable we are to miſtake the meaning of words; how apt to be impoſed on by a miſrepreſentation of facts, we may charge that to deſign which was the effect of inadvertency; and our being hurt may be owing perhaps more to the too great nicety of our ſenſations, than to any real offence we have received.—But let us take it in the worſt light, and ſuppoſe the blow that has been given to have proceeded from a malignant heart, yet ſhall we ſuffer our enemy to triumph over us, by being able to ſhake our ſouls from a ſteady adherence to Chriſtian virtue? No, rather let us imitate our great Maſter, by
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:015584_0031_0F998F00B125CD68"/>
pitying the wretch, who, in injuring us, has offended a Being as juſt as he is merciful, and who will not fail to puniſh all ſuch evil doers.</p>
            <p>Vengeance is mine, ſaith the Lord, and I will ſurely repay:" to him then let us leave it, nor impiouſly dare to direct the thunder-bolt from his Almighty Hand, by aſſuming the right of puniſhment to ourſelves. Nor let the miſtaken pride, which makes us dread the cenſure of creatures not at all ſuperior to ourſelves, prevail over our good reſolutions, and make us act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the dictates of our own conſcience.</p>
            <p>True greatneſs of mind can never conſiſt in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, ſince the baſeſt, the meaneſt coward, will purſue it to the utmoſt: but to forbear revenge, and forgive your enemy when you have him in your power, is an action which will add dignity to the higheſt character, and a victory over the paſſions, which none but the truly brave could ever attain.</p>
            <p>It is true, there are ſome caſes in which a man is obliged to vindicate his right, where his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune or reputation are injuriouſly attacked. It is ſo far from being blameable, that it is really commendable to defend them to the utmoſt of
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:015584_0032_0F998F016244CFD8"/>
our power: but having done that, let all perſonal malice ceaſe; and though our adverſary ſhould be ſullen, and make no conceſſion, yet let not that impede our forgiveneſs, but let us remember that we are beings liable to error, and not inſiſt on that ſubmiſſion and acknowledgement of offence from our fellow-creatures, which is due only to God: that God, who is our common father and our judge, and who hath taught us by the parable of the unmerciful ſervant on what terms we may expect mercy.</p>
            <p>When we look up to the great ſource of all perfection, in whoſe ſight the angels are not pure; and conſider our own imperfection, how often we offend, and how miſerable we muſt be unleſs he pardons, can we be ſevere to our fellow-ſervant, whoſe weak nature, like our own, is not always proof againſt temptation? "Forgive us our treſpaſſes as we forgive them who treſpaſs againſt us," is the Chriſtian's daily prayer: and it is a mockery of God to offer up petitions on ſuch terms as we are reſolved not to comply with. Let us not deceive ourſelves, and think that a meer outward form, and words of courſe, will ſupply the place of that unfeigned cordial forgiveneſs which Chriſt requires as only available for God's pardoning us: "for ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:015584_0033_0F998F021CA86D00"/>
ſaith he, ſhall my heavenly Father do alſo unto you, if ye from your hearts forgive not every man his treſpaſſes." He elſewhere enjoins his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to intercede with God for their enemies, before whom it is both impious and dangerous to diſſemble, and from whom no mercy can be expected for thoſe who with feigned lips aſk it for others.</p>
            <p>A man who conſults his own eaſe, will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly never ſuffer the corroſive pangs of malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and hatred to take poſſeſſion of his breaſt, inſtead of the gentle, pacific frame of mind which, promoting the good of others, enſures peace and tranquillity to himſelf in this world, and on which his happineſs to all eternity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends.</p>
            <p>It would be vain to urge any more arguments: he who refuſes obedience to this law ſhuts the gates of heaven againſt himſelf; nor aught doth it avail him that the Son of God condeſcended to be made Man, to live a life of poverty and affliction, and to die an ignominious and pain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

            <head>OF MIRTH AND GRIEF.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PROVERBS xvii. 13.</bibl>
               <q>Even in laughter the heart is ſorrowful; and the end of that mirth is heavineſs.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is not to be ſuppoſed that, by theſe words, the preacher meant to condemn that innocent cheerfulneſs which is generally the companion of minds unacquainted with vice, and its atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant misfortunes. To enjoy the bleſſings which heaven beſtows upon us, is the beſt way of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

               </gap> gratitude to the giver; and it is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable notion of the Deity to ſuppoſe him beſt pleaſed with ſeeing his creatures covered with gloom and melancholy; leſs acceptable ſtill to a pure Being muſt be that immoderate mirth, which ſhuts out every ſerious thought, and too often ends in riot and debauchery.</p>
            <p>The royal preacher, who had made pleaſure his ultimate aim; whoſe power and riches were equal to his wiſdom, by which God had diſtinguiſhed him above all the kings of the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:015584_0035_0F998F047808E110"/>
earth: this prince, bleſſed with every advantage, employed them all in a ſearch after happineſs: he gave a looſe to his ſoul, reſolved to find out that which could yield it the moſt delight.</p>
            <p>After having vainly ſought it among the noiſy pleaſures of the world, he concludes with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, "that if it was any where to be found, it was in peaceful joys, and the calm felicity that ariſes from the conſciouſneſs of a well ſpent life."</p>
            <p>In many places he exclaims againſt the folly of thoſe who attempt to loſe their cares in loud peals of merriment: "I ſaid of laughter it is mad, and of mirth, what doth it?" Eccleſ. ii. 2. A queſtion which may be very well aſked, ſince experience convinces us, that when we fly from ourſelves to ſuch a reſource, it is only parting from our anxieties for a moment, to have them returned afterwards with redoubled force.</p>
            <p>How often have we found, after an evening paſt in the utmoſt feſtivity, our ſpirits exhauſted to a great degree, and even ſtill more lowered by a recollection of the laſt night's mirth! Nor will indeed always the cauſes of our merriment bear a retroſpection. Too often the wit which
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:015584_0036_0F998F058FECC070"/>
circulates the loud laugh, owes its poignancy to ſomething which muſt put modeſty to the bluſh; and ſometimes it ſhocks good-nature, by turning into ridicule the defects of a perſon who is not endowed with a capacity to return the ſatire. Add to this, that midnight revels generally incapacitate us for buſineſs the next day, and almoſt always unfit us for devotion.</p>
            <p>But here let it not be underſtood that I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn as criminal all aſſemblies met with a deſign of being merry. Recreation is not only deſirable, but neceſſary: man is a ſocial being, and ſociety was not deſigned as a ſnare, but a comfort to him. A cheerful freedom of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation ſoftens our natures, and prevents our falling into moroſeneſs. On the other hand, if cheerfulneſs degenerates into licentiouſneſs, it degrades us below humanity.</p>
            <p>There have been, perhaps, inſtances of men who have run into extreme riot, which their minds did not approve, merely from a fear of the imputation of ill-nature, and a want of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance. Good-nature, indeed, I look on as ſo eſſential, that all other virtues without it are of no value: it is the mark of an open generous

ſoul, and finiſhes the character of a good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> renders a man a uſeful member of ſociety, as well as an amiable companion to his friends: it ſweetens converſation, and has the art of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying inſtruction in ſo pleaſing a manner, as never to offend: but there is a weakneſs which paſſes by that name, that makes people incap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of reſiſting importunity, however unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and by that folly they lie expoſed to every temptation: not at all guided by their own rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, they are governed wholly by example, and blindly conform to the humours of others, without any ſettled principle of their own to rule their actions.</p>
            <p>This fooliſh ſof<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eſs of diſpoſition is ſo far from deſerving the name of good-nature, or complaiſance, that it is owing to a baſe puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, which firſt enſlaves, and, by conſequence, at laſt renders us deſpicable.</p>
            <p>Another reaſon which I am apt to believe is often laid hold of for running into this danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous extreme, is the deſire of acting in oppoſition to thoſe gloomy mortals who look on every degree of merriment as vicious and immoral;
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:015584_0038_0F998F06A2B4C7E8"/>
who proudly arrogate to themſelves the right of laying down rules for the world, and ſeverely cenſure thoſe who refuſe to be guided by them. Though theſe men may mean well, and deſerve rather pity than anger, yet they are apt to raiſe indignation in minds of an oppoſite turn, and make them give into a blameable levity, in order ſhew their deteſtation of the others abſurdities.</p>
            <p>What imperfect creatures are we that we muſt thus err on one ſide or the other! I have, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, heard it alledged by ſome, in defence of gaiety, that when the ſpirits are high, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding appears with the greateſt luſtre: poſſibly ſome witticiſms may at ſuch times ſtart forth; and often, I am afraid, in the height of their follies they run into ſuch ridiculous fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eries, as they bluſh afterwards to reflect on: but ſuppoſe I grant, which I readily can, that men of wit may ſhew themſelves to advantage, when they give a looſe to their humour; yet we muſt allow ſuch humour is dangerous, as a man, elated with ſeeing himſelf admired by his company, is apt to be off his guard, and not to ſet proper limits to his tongue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:015584_0039_0F998F07B69EAE68"/>
In ſhort, it may be ſaid, immoderate mirth is only an artifice to avoid thinking, and is of no real advantage either to body or mind: fills men with more ſpirits than it leaves them able to govern; it baniſhes ſerious converſation, and leaves nothing but ſuperficial conceits in the place, which, by inſenſible degrees, produce habitual vanity and impertinence, below the dignity of human nature; and when once you ſee a man degrade himſelf into a buffoon, tho' you may laugh, yet at the ſame time you deſpiſe him.</p>
            <p>I would now particularly addreſs myſelf to to young people, who cry youth is the ſeaſon for mirth, and think they find an excuſe in that for every folly they are guilty of: reflection ſeldom finds a place in their breaſts, and they ſpend the beſt of their days, the time when health and ſpirits would enable them to engage in laudable and uſeful purſuits, in a conſtant round of amuſements, and a ſtudy, if it may be ſo ſtiled, how to laugh away the morning of their lives: the noon ſucceeds, when their ſerious thoughts are taken up with the buſineſs of this life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the evening comes on, when they wonder
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:015584_0040_0F998F0B8F280528"/>
that the hour, which once appeared at ſuch infinite diſtance, is ſtolen ſo ſoon upon them; but as ſerious thoughts will ſometimes intrude, however unwelcome, let me beg my young hearers will not always drive them away by tumult and noiſe: a very little conſideration will convince them, unleſs they are loſt in unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable indiſcretion that tumultuary pleaſures leave a ſting behind them, and that thoſe only can bear a future recollection which have been governed by reaſon and moderation.</p>
            <p>I fear thoſe of rank and fortune, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample have the moſt influence on mankind, do, by their practice, encourage extravagancies of this ſort. Bred up in idleneſs, their general employment is to contrive to kill time agreeably, as it is called; but ſurely theſe are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful returns to the Divine Bounty, which has ſo liberally provided for their happineſs beyond the common lot of mortals: it is true, they have no hard labour to wear out their bodies and exhauſt their minds; and certainly this ought to be looked on as a bleſſing. But are there not ways by which even they may employ their time in a manner uſeful to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and to others? The prudent management
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:015584_0041_0F998F0F0BD937E8"/>
of a plentiful fortune requirers the owner's attention, perhaps, not leſs than the neceſſary proviſion for daily maintenance does that of the man in narrow circumſtances.</p>
            <p>Some time too ought to be allowed to the duties of hoſpitality, to entertain our friends and neighbours in a manner ſuited to their rank, and our own; and, upon the whole, we ſhall find that the gentleman's time may be as fully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed as his, who labours for his living, with this difference only, that God has allotted the former the moſt agreeable way of ſpending it; and, as the bounty of heaven has exempted ſuch men from the common cares of life, it is a duty incumbent on them to endeavour to become uſeful members of the commonwealth, as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates to apportion a part of their time to the diſtribution of juſtice, for the puniſhment of vice, and the encouragement of virtue.</p>
            <p>By thus making themſelves of conſequence to human ſociety, they may always prevent time from being burdenſome to them: and ſuppoſe there ſhould be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap>ome leiſure hours, certainly a perſon of liberal education can never be at a loſs how to ſpend it, both with delight and
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:015584_0042_0F998F10978F76B0"/>
improvement. In order to aſſure ourſelves that we have no time to ſpend in riot and exceſs, we need only compare the period of our lives with the vaſt variety of avocations we have to employ them in.</p>
            <p>The term we have to live may generally be called ſeventy years; and though ſome few ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their race beyond that time, much fewer ever arrive at it. However, let us ſuppoſe that to be the ſtretch of man's life, yet many years muſt neceſſarily be loſt in childhood; and the infirmities of age, though not felt equally in all, will undoubtedly deprive us of ſome more: add to this, the neceſſary portion of hours allotted to the buſineſs of eating, ſleeping, dreſſing, viſiting: the management of our families and fortunes call for their ſhare of our attention:</p>
            <p>And is there none to be dedicated to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of our God? Alas! how little do the beſt of us conſider what we owe to the Author of our being, and the Giver of every thing that can make that being deſirable! Does he not deſerve from us ſome return of gratitude? and is not even ſelf-intereſt concerned in appropriating a few hours to the conſideration of eternity? If we
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:015584_0043_0F998F11471AB1F0"/>
cannot find time for that moſt neceſſary of all duties, we ought rather to regret our having ſo little, than trifle away what we have. But I make no doubt every one is convinced of the truth of what I ſay; and a little conſideration ought to be ſufficient to make us not neglect this important concern.</p>
            <p>But as it is neceſſary for the mind of man to be ſometimes relaxed and amuſed, I would point out thoſe amuſements which appear to be both innocent and agreeable; among which we may reckon painting and muſic: painting, where people are bleſt with a genius, is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful employment; and muſic exalts the ſoul, and raiſes it above this world; it inſpires the moſt pleaſing devotion, and anticipates the pleaſures of hereafter.</p>
            <p>There are few perſons of good education who have not a taſte for ſome of the polite arts, which will ever procure a laudable and pleaſing entertainment; but there are ſome entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which may be enjoyed by every one whoſe fortune will allow it; among which none can be more pleaſing to a beneficent mind than that of relieving the pains of the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:015584_0044_0F998F11DFE859A8"/>
diſtreſſed; to wipe away the tear of the afflicted; to eaſe the aching heart; to render life deſirable to thoſe to whom it has been burdenſome, are pleaſures that not only may be called ſo, at the time they are performed, but will ever afford pleaſure on reflection, which noiſe, riot, and exceſs of mirth can never do.</p>
            <p>Among other rational pleaſures give me leave to mention one which I cannot look on as the leaſt; I mean that which ariſes in the mind from the view of beautiful rural ſcenes: here we may ſurvey the ſtupendous works of the great Creator, till we loſe ourſelves in admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and delight.</p>
            <p>This is a pleaſure which will never pall; the eye is never tired with gazing on the beauties of nature; ſtill are they ſeen with new wonder; ſtill beheld with freſh delight. On ſuch occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the ſoul is naturally led to adore that Being, whoſe wiſdom and goodneſs are ſo evidently diſplayed before us. Happy man! who in thus contemplating the Deity can find ſublime en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, which the gay voluptuary can never know, and compared with which all his ſenſual joys are worthleſs.</p>

               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:015584_0045_0F998F12A509E348"/>
Such amuſements as theſe may be truly called a foretaſte of heaven, and will fit us for thoſe pure and laſting pleaſures; which that we may enjoy through all eternity, God of his infinite mercy grant, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>

            <p>THESE few words carry with them a threat, which it might be imagined would be ſufficient to deter any from too ſeverely cenſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the conduct of others. If we would look into our own actions, and truly examine thoſe for which we muſt one day be accountable, we ſhould find very little leiſure, as well as inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to inſpect thoſe of other people.</p>
            <p>If our diſpoſition leads us rather to condemn than approve, we may gratify that propenſity by turning our eyes inward, and not injure another by wounding his reputation.

faults; but thoſe who are inclinable to cenſure the failings of others, will rarely err on the favourable ſide.</p>
            <p>When the cenſorious tell a ſtory which hurts the character of any one, they either ſkip over or very lightly touch on the circumſtances which might incline the hearers to judge candidly, but dwell upon, and, perhaps, too often exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerate thoſe which ſhew things in the worſt light.</p>
            <p>Slanderers may be divided into two claſſes: the firſt are they whoſe diabolical natures lead them to invent fictions to traduce the character of any to whom they owe a grudge: the ſecond are thoſe who induſtriouſly ſpread the ſcandal which they have heard from others. From the firſt of theſe calumniators what innocence can ſecure us? What virtue can defend us from the malice of an enemy who is not reſtrained by the ties of honour, or checks of conſcience? I fear ſuch wretches are too far gone for any thing I can ſay to have an effect upon them; I ſhall only then deſire thoſe who ſuffer from the undeſerved aſperſions of the wicked, to comfort themſelves with an aſſurance that truth will at

length triumph over falſehood, and a conſtant perſeverance in well doing, will be too hard even for malevolence itſelf.</p>
            <p>The ſecond ſort of ſlanderers which I ſhall mention, are they whoſe ears are ever open to ſcandal; who are greedy in hearing, and eager in ſpreading reports: if the things which ſuch a one relates are not of ſome conſequence, there will be no pleaſure in ſeeming to know them; this leads him to inflame every word and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance; to aggravate what is blameable; to pervert what is not ſo; and miſrepreſent the moſt indifferent actions. I am afraid too many commit this fault, without ever reflecting that they are ſinning againſt their neighbour in the moſt eſſential point in which they can injure him; that they are robbing him of what is much more precious than all his other poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions: yet this is really the caſe; and what makes the injury ſtill more atrocious is, that it is generally more irreparable than any other.</p>

man who has wounded another's reputation to reſtore it whole as before. The evil which has been ſaid of any one is not eaſily forgotten, but is often remembered to their diſadvantage long after it has ceaſed to be talked of.</p>
            <p>It may not be an obſervation quite unworthy of remark, that thoſe people are uſually moſt ſevere upon the faults of others, who have leaſt merit themſelves to boaſt of; their ſouls not capable of riſing to any emulation, find a ſatisfaction in levelling the reſt of the world to their own pitch: But how ineffectual as well as deteſtable a method of covering defects is this? It is certain never to ſucceed: the defamer is always ſure to have a number of ſpies on his own conduct, who will not fail to expoſe to public view the errors of a perſon who makes it his buſineſs to point out thoſe of others.</p>
            <p>If a man would ſecure to himſelf the good-will of mankind, it muſt be by a quite contrary practice; by at leaſt being neuter, and, if he has not good-nature enough to palliate, not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly aggravate faults. A good word is an eaſy obligation; but not to ſpeak ill requires only our ſilence, which coſts us nothing, ſays

archbiſhop Tillotſon; but it is a melancholy reflection to think there ſhould be in mankind an uncharitable ſpirit which finds greater plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in detecting faults, than in commending virtues.</p>
            <p>It is ſad, but I fear too true, that none are more liable to cenſure than thoſe whoſe great and good qualities might be looked on as a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain defence againſt it. The evil minded and envious never fail to find a flaw in thoſe virtues which they cannot imitate. Thoſe who have deſervedly met with applauſe, from the diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and generous, have often been loaded with reproach by the raſh judging and cruel.</p>
            <p>I hope I ſhall not be underſtood here as lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſcouragement in the way of thoſe who wiſh to purſue the paths of virtue: for though a good life cannot ſilence calumny, it will at length diſarm it, by ſhewing the falſeneſs of report. The malicious ſlanderer may, for a time, hurt the good name of another, by injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſcandal; but hereafter it will be found that he has done the moſt material injury to himſelf, ſince the ſevere judgment which he has paſſed upon others, will undoubtedly be paſſed upon

            <p>I will here mention what is ſeldom taken notice of, but yet is the moſt inſidious way of ruining reputation; I mean by commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By beſtowing laviſh praiſes on ſlight virtues, the character of candour is cheaply ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and an eaſy belief gained, when after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it is made uſe of to the perfidious purpoſe of detraction in matters of real conſequence.</p>
            <p>The cruelty of this practice can hardly be equalled; and, I am ſorry to ſay it, is too ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully made uſe of againſt the moſt weak and defenceleſs part of the creation; whoſe charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters once ſullied can never be waſhed clean by floods of tears, or regained by the moſt faultleſs conduct: yet ſurely I may be pardoned when I ſay that, among thoſe unhappy females, who by one falſe ſtep have for ever forfeited any claim to the world's good opion of their paſt or future actions, there are ſome who, had they not been poſſeſſed of the moſt amiable qualities that can adorn the mind, would never have fallen.</p>

Tenderneſs of diſpoſition, attachment, an open unreſerved confidence, an unſuſpecting inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, have been the ſources of that fatal error, which has unfitted them for chaſte ſociety, and made them the ſcorn of thoſe who have either eſcaped through want of ſolicitation, or owed their preſervation to the frigidity of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and prudent ſelfiſhneſs of their hearts.</p>
            <p>Unhappy women! the ſame delicacy of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent which betrayed you to your ruin, makes it inſupportable to be deſpiſed "by each affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſhe who tells your ſtory, and bleſſes her kind ſtars that ſhe is virtuous."

"how they ſcatter fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brands and death, and ſay, am I not in ſport?"</p>
            <p>We ought to look on every one's character as too ſacred to be traduced from ſuſpicion only; appearances are very fallacious, and we are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Indeed it is impoſſible a noble mind can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to ſlander even an enemy; but it is a certain ſign of a mean and abject ſoul to delight in hearing and talking ſcandal. It was an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ſaying of Antoninus, the great emperor and philoſopher, 'No man was ever unhappy for not prying into the actions and conditions of other men; but that man is neceſſarily ſo, who doth not obſerve himſelf, and conſider his own ſoul.'</p>
            <p>Undoubtedly it is our greateſt intereſt to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine our own hearts: here, I fancy, the beſt of us will find ſo many daily offences, ſuch a variety of paſſions to be kept under, ſuch repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed failures in our duty, that to keep a proper guard upon ourſelves we ſhall find no leiſure to

            <p>I am afraid it ſeldom happens that a perſon who is fond of tale-bearing keeps ſtrictly to truth: the enlarging on a ſtory, ſo as to excite the curiouſity of your hearers, fixes their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and makes them liſten with eagerneſs, which is the great point a dealer in ſcandal has to gain.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, I know no crime, except murder, that can be of ſuch real bad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence as what I have now been treating of; as there is no warding off a blow which is often given by an unknown hand, and may do us irreparable injury before we find out from whence it comes: nor is there any ſin for which, I think, can be pleaded ſo little excuſe: other vices have ſomething in view, from which a ſelf-gratification may be propoſed: the ambitious man may expatiate on the charms of power, the libertine on the delights of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuality, and the miſer on the enjoyment of wealth; but the ſlanderer propoſes no other pleaſure to himſelf but that of ſeeing others wretched: it proceeds from a corroſive ſelf-tormenting

            <p>There is no diſpoſition which our Bleſſed Saviour expreſſes his diſapprobation of, more than this uncharitable one: he diſplays his diſlike of our exalting ourſelves by degrading our neighbours, in that elegant parable of the Publican and Phariſee; he condemns the ſelf-ſufficiency of him who could ſee the ſmalleſt mote in his brother's eye, while he was uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of a much more greater obſtruction in his own.</p>
            <p>And, finally, he aſſures us, that the ſame juſtice we ſhew in our judgment of our fellow-creatures, ſhall we receive at the hand of our Creator. May this equitable ſentence deter us from cruelly reviling each other, and teach us to live in that brotherly love and harmony which becomes the Followers of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THIS is a precept on which I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member ever to have heard a ſermon, though it enjoins a duty which I fear we have too often occaſion to be reminded of.</p>
            <p>The great law of Nature has implanted in every human breaſt a diſpoſition to love and revere thoſe to whom we have been taught, from our earlieſt infancy, to look up for every comfort, conveniency, and pleaſure in life; while that ſtate of dependency remains, the impreſſion continues in its full force, but cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is that it gradually weakens and wears off as we become maſters of ourſelves, which made it indiſpenſably neceſſary, leſt we ſhould dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate into ingratitude and diſobedience, that a
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:015584_0057_0F9990DE5E38C548"/>
poſitive command ſhould be given; and, to render this injunction the more forcible, God has annexed to it a peculiar reward, a number of happy years to thoſe whoſe filial obedience is ſuch as is acceptable to the common Father of all: and as he has been pleaſed to expreſs his approbation of a ſteady adherence to this law, by ſingular marks of favour, ſo likewiſe did he puniſh the breach of it by exemplary diſpleaſure; death was the only expiation of this crime.</p>
            <p>Nor were the Jews the only nation who looked upon diſobedience to parents as worthy of capital puniſhment. Even at this day I have heard it confidently affirmed that, among the Chineſe, ſhould a ſon ſo far forget himſelf as to lift his hand in a hoſtile manner againſt his father, not only himſelf, but his wife and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren would be put to death, his ſervants and dependents would ſhare the ſame fate, the houſe where he lived would be razed, and the ground ſown with ſalt, as ſuppoſing that there muſt be the moſt hopeleſs depravity of manners in a community to which ſuch a monſter belonged.</p>

Herodotus, in his account of the religion and cuſtoms of the Perſians, tells us that they look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on parricide as an impoſſible thing; and that when any action happened, which appeared to be like it, the reputed ſon was conſidered as ſuppoſitious, and probably owing his birth to adultery: their notion, in this particular, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſhewed in what a heinous light they regarded the ſin of undutifulneſs in general.</p>
            <p>I muſt confeſs, when any diſpute betwixt parents and children riſes high, I am inclinable to think the latter the aggreſſors. The anxious ſolicitude of parental affection, the daily fatigue which attends the nurture of helpleſs infancy, the unwearied application that is requiſite for the formation of the minds of youth, the anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which the parent feels for the future wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of his offspring, often, perhaps, denying himſelf conveniences that his children may have ſuperfluities, are obligations ſuch as can never be acquitted; and, I own, it has often given me great pain when I have heard it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked that love deſcended: ſurely ſuch an obſervation is a reproach to human nature.</p>

Is it poſſible that paternal tenderneſs ſhould outweigh filial gratitude? That a knowledge of long try'd friendſhip, experienced virtues, and the receiving benefits, which, were we to employ ourſelves daily in paying, would ſtill leave us debtors, ſhould form weaker ties than what proceed chiefly from inſtinct<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and are fixed even bfore we can judge whether the creature on whom we laviſh our fondneſs is worthy of it or not.</p>
            <p>Strange! that the receiving of favours ſhould leſs inſpire us with ſentiments of love, genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and reſpect, than the conferring them! that the patron or parent ſhould be leſs dear to the dependent o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Yet it is certain, that there are many more undutiful children than there are unkind parents: the great wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Creator has determined there ſhould be few of the latter, in order to the preſervation of mankind; but ſurely that there ſhould be many of the former is a diſgrace to humanity. The Almighty, our benevolent Father, has, in many places of ſacred writ, denounced the heavieſt curſes againſt thoſe who honour not their parents.</p>

On the contrary, he whoſe heart is endowed with filial pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ty, may look up to heaven with a certain aſſurance of having his prayers heard, his deſires gratified, and of meeting with that return of duty from his children which he has ſhewn to his parents. But he who has filled his father's ſoul with bitterneſs, and drawn tears from his mother's eyes, may juſtly fear a ſon that will revenge their wrongs.</p>
            <p>The judgments of God can never appear more ſeverely than by making them feel, in their own perſons, the ſharp pangs which are occaſioned by the ingratitude of children. I believe it ſeldom happens but that diſobedience is puniſhed this way; for they who have been forgetful themſelves of the great duty owing to thoſe from whom they drew their birth, will rarely teach it their offspring.</p>
            <p>A love of that ſelf which they ſee renewed in their children, generally makes them run into a blind fondneſs, which leaves them the dupes of their own folly; for thoſe, who, by their example, have learned neither love or eſteem, are ſure to turn that unmerited partiality
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:015584_0061_0F9990E1C6001A30"/>
to their own emolument, and deſpiſe thoſe from whom they receive it.</p>
            <p>In the earlieſt ages of the world, men were wont to look on a parent's bleſſing as a thing of the greateſt conſequence to their future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, and to dread his curſe as an entail of miſery on them and their poſterity. Nor were theſe hopes and fears without foundation; for we have many inſtances in ancient hiſtory where God ſeems to confirm what the father has wiſhed to ſucceeding generations: and this muſt certainly have a good effect on the minds of children, as they would deſire to avoid miſery and obtain happineſs.</p>
            <p>Let us not look on it as ſuperſtitious to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that ſuch wiſhes may ſtill carry weight with them, and that our fulfilling or neglecting our duty to parents may be rewarded or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even in this world. But ſhould that not be the caſe, if we have any belief in religion, we may know that it will be ſo in another; and ſurely what laſts to eternity is worth our care. I cannot help here remarking a ſpecies of ingratitude and folly, which is but too common: it often happens that people in a low ſtation of life are
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:015584_0062_0F9990E23459BFA8"/>
ſolicitous that their children ſhall riſe to a higher degree: to affect which, they think no labour too much; they deny themſelves every pleaſure, except what proceeeds from imagination, in anticipating the figure which their young ones ſhall hereafter make in the world.</p>
            <p>They are indeed, for the moſt part, much too ſanguine in their expectations; but ſuppoſe them quite anſwered, and that they ſee their children in a ſituation ſuperior to their hopes, yet how often does it happen that the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their being raiſed, inſtead of exciting ſentiments of gratitude and reſpect towards thoſe who gave up every thing to make them what they are, is, that they are aſhamed of their origninal, and bluſh to acknowledge their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and benefactors; who receive no other return for their kindneſs than the being ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in public, and deſpiſed in private.</p>
            <p>In this caſe, the miſtaken notions of the parent is no excuſe for the baſe ingratitude of the child. But there are ſome who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves dutiful, and perhaps are called ſo by the world, becauſe they are never deficient in any outward marks of reſpect, which coſt them no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:015584_0063_0F9990E2E7E499C8"/>
thing, but are very ſparing in adminiſtering to their parents neceſſities. Indeed it is the duty of a man, if his circumſtances will admit of it, never to let a parent know what neceſſity is, but to be induſtrious in finding out their wants, without putting them to the humbling taſk of reciting them, and aſking that as a favour which they have a right to demand as a debt.</p>
            <p>It is not giving alone, but giving without grudging or the leaſt ſeeming reluctance, that can make the gift valuable where ſo much is owing: not a murmur, not a complaint ſhould be heard; but the cheerfulneſs of the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſhould rather expreſs a ſenſe of receiving than conferring an obligation. Nor is it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to allow juſt enough to keep them above want; to allot a certain ſum, and, if we find it not laſt to the time we expected, ſeem to wonder at it, as if we exacted an account where we have no right to expect any; but, on the contrary, it is our duty to take care that there ſhall be always ſomething more than enough: ſurely there is no reaſon to fear that a parent will ever make an ill uſe of the generoſity of his children. But, above all, there is one thing of which we ought never to be guilty; I mean the trumpeting to
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:015584_0064_0F9990E3AA8FB8B0"/>
the world our deeds, as if we aſſumed to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a merit in making our money ſubſervient to a mere act of duty. If a parent has any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy, it will be terrible to hear from a third perſon, of the obligations they are under to their children; to thoſe who owe to them not only their being, but their health, their educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, their all, and without whoſe ſuſtaining hand they had now been themſelves deſtitute of ſupport.</p>
            <p>I have now done with this branch of my ſubject, as I look upon it there would be no end anſwered farther; ſince, after all, if a man's own mind does not incline him to act liberally toward his parents, it will be hardly poſſible to inſtil it into him. But there is another error which people of perhaps real goodneſs of heart in other particulars, are apt to fall into; the deſpiſing the want of that genius, politeneſs, and addreſs, in their parents, which themſelves are poſſeſſed off; inſtead of exerting their abilities to conceal theſe defects from the eyes of others, they are the firſt to expoſe and ridicule them, thinking by that means to make their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence the more admired: but ſurely the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of talents, at the expence of thoſe to whom
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:015584_0065_0F9990E4696D0E88"/>
we owe moſt reverence, is a vanity below our purſuit. No one can be exalted by the degra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

            <p>I ſhall conclude this diſcourſe with an exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſeriouſly to conſider of the vaſt debt which is due to parents, of the abſolute command of God to obedience, and the many curſes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt thoſe who refuſe to obey.

            <p>While they think no expence too much, no pains too great to beſtow, in giving them thoſe ſhowy accompliſhments which will diſtinguiſh them in the world, they too often neglect to teach them a true knowledge of themſelves, a government of their paſſions, and that uniform rectitude of manners, without which all ſuperfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial outward ornaments are vain and empty.
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:015584_0067_0F9990E5DDB94C78"/>
Religion is the baſe on which all virtue is built; it ought, therefore, to be the buſineſs of the educator to inſtil into the minds of his pupil an early veneration for the Deity; a fear of offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that God who is omnipreſent, who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, and from whoſe bleſſing alone they can ever hope for happineſs, either in this world or the next.</p>
            <p>This firſt foundation carefully laid, is ſeldom known not to have an influence through life. Such is the force of habit, that thoſe who have had the advantage of a religious education are ſhocked at the firſt appearances of vice, and very rarely deviate far from the leſſons of virtue which they have learnt in their infancy.</p>
            <p>As the chiſſel works the rude block, into ſhape, ſo education forms the human ſoul, which would otherwiſe be filled with nothing more than a jumble of wild unconnected ideas, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of forming itſelf into any regular ſyſtem. If we enquire into the cauſes why there are ſuch numbers of people in the world who ſeem to have no ſettled principles of right or wrong, but to be ſwayed by intereſt or paſſion in every action of their lives, we ſhall find it chiefly
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:015584_0068_0F9990E69C340820"/>
owing to the wrong bias of their education. Parents are more ſolicitous that their children ſhould ſhine through the brilliancy of their wit, and politeneſs of addreſs, than excel in a plain unaffected goodneſs of heart. In fine, they wiſh them rather to talk eloquently than act virtuouſly. But, good God! of how little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence is a flow of words, unleſs they convey the real dictates of a mind untainted with folly, and uncorrupted with vice.</p>
            <p>It is much to be wiſhed that the honeſt ear might never be enchanted by falſe reaſoning, delivered in a graceful manner, and that it might never be in the power of the wicked to acquire the aid of rhetoric. To prevent which evil the ſeeds of religion ſhould be firſt ſown in the infant mind, the beſt ſtock on which to engraft the moral virtues, and without which founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to inculcate leſſons of morality muſt be vain. Every the leaſt tendency to vice ſhould be checked, becauſe if thought on as of little conſequence, and ſo overlooked or indulged, it ſoon grows into habit, and habitual faults are very hard to conquer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="unknown:015584_0069_0F9990E758219108"/>
The moſt uſeful part of education is to learn and practiſe our duty towards God, and towards our neighbour; to be ſtrictly and conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly juſt; and what is ſtill more, to be liberal without oſtentation; to be poſſeſſed of that tender feeling for others ſufferings, which, in its ſeveral degrees, extends itſelf to every animal of creation, from our fellow creatures to the loweſt reptile, are qualities infinitely ſuperior to what commonly embelliſh people of the moſt refined education.</p>
            <p>In vain do we heap up riches for our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, if we take no care to inform them in what manner they ſhould uſe them: inſtead of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their virtue we are laying ſnares for it, by providing them the means of indulging vices, which a life of labour and induſtry might have prevented their having leiſure to think of. In the bringing up of children parents ought not to rely entirely on their own judgments, ſince their partiality often prevents them from ſeeing, and ſtill more often from correcting errors in their offspring, which in their future lives may be of fatal conſequence.</p>

An ancient philoſopher being aſked, What he thought moſt proper for children to learn? anſwered, That which they ought to do when they grow up. It is unreaſonable to expect an equal improvement in all children; ſome minds open very ſlowly, and require great pains in inſtructing, and others are ſo very barren, that it is working againſt nature to teach them any thing; if theſe are harmleſs it is ſufficient, and to attempt to inſtil a greater knowledge than to diſtinguiſh right from wrong, is only to do them hurt.</p>
            <p>But there are ſome who diſplay an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon underſtanding, at an age when nothing is expected from them; the doating parent is ſo pleaſed with this early appearance of wit, and admires his child's lively parts to ſuch a degree as to leave him almoſt to his own guidance; who ſoon becomes ſenſible of his conſequence, and grows negligent from a perſuaſion that he has already attained the height of improvement, by which miſtake he generally appears at twenty the ſame that he was at ten.</p>
            <p>It has often been a matter of diſpute, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther public or private tuition is moſt eligible;
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:015584_0071_0F9990E8D99A3AD0"/>
undoubtedly, where a preceptor has only one pupil to attend, he may ſtudy his diſpoſition in ſuch a manner as to let nothing paſs unobſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which may be either of future advantage or detriment to him: in his frequent converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he may convey inſtruction in the moſt pleaſing manner, if he has the art of letting it fall naturally in, and loſing the name of tutor in that of friend; when the appearance of the tutor is too rigidly diſplayed, he is liſtened to perhaps with reſpect, but generally with too great a diſlike for any of his precepts to make an impreſſion on the hearer.</p>
            <p>But I think it not impoſſible, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to practiſe this addreſs, even where there are numbers; and one advantage there certainly is where there is a community, that it will create an emulation, a laudable deſire to excel.</p>
            <p>There are inſtances of children who will ſhed tears at being outdone: this temper; if kept within proper limits, and not ſuffered to dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate into envy, may be a noble incitement to virtue; as that is the moſt promiſing diſpoſition where ſhame is the greateſt puniſhment that can be inflicted: to ſuch praiſe will ever be
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:015584_0072_0F9990E99B9B8CF8"/>
the greateſt reward, and will never loſe its end; but will always be a means of preventing negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and a ſpur to induſtry in every taſk they undertake. There is one method of teaching of which I cannot approve; I mean ſevere diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline: I know no mind on which this treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can have the deſired effect; the generous and open it provokes, the gentle it terrifies, and the obdurate it hardens.</p>
            <p>I look upon it, that there is no greater pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative againſt the temptations which beſt youth, than the being engaged in the attaining of any uſeful knowledge: Idleneſs is the nurſe of evil thoughts, and it ought to be the chief care of parents to engage the young mind in a continual purſuit of ſome valuable acquiſition, until it has learned wiſdom and philoſophy ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to regulate its conduct.</p>
            <p>An old Greek poet uſed to ſay, that educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was like the hand and ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, it rooted up vice, and planted virtue. It is to be lamented, but is certainly true, that what is called the beſt education is, for the moſt part, the worſt: dancing, muſic, and French, take up ſo much time, that there is little left for more uſeful

ſtudies: thought theſe are accompliſhments that ſhould not be entirely ſlighted, yet they ought not to be thought of conſequence ſufficient to employ whole years in learning, which is often the caſe; while the greater concerns, what would qualify them for amiable members of ſociety, make them worthy maſters and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, and valuable friends, are totally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.</p>
            <p>I would not have it here underſtood as if I thought all the hours of childhood ſhould be employed in grave exerciſes: relaxation is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly neceſſary both for the body and mind; to divide their time between learning and amuſement, ſo that they may ever return to the former with pleaſure and alacrity, and ſtudy may never ſeem irkſome to them, is the great art, and what teachers ſhould chiefly attend to.</p>
            <p>Hitherto I have ſpoken in general terms of both ſexes, I ſhall now confine myſelf to the female one, whoſe education is of great conſequence to the world, and is, I think, in general, ſadly miſtaken. Boarding ſchools are the places where they are uſually bred: as I
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:015584_0074_0F9990EB24704328"/>
have had frequent opportunities of making obſervations on theſe ſeminaries of feminine learning, I muſt confeſs, I never ſaw any whoſe management I could entirely approve of. They ſeldom teach any thing more than external modes, and outward ceremonies; the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs's own knowledge rarely extending fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and as they are oftener people of a narrow than a liberal mind, they are generally partial to thoſe children who have moſt fortune, or from whom they receive the greateſt advantage.</p>
            <p>Add to this, that the chief care of them is left to teachers, who are for the moſt part, eſpecially the French, extremely ignorant, and from whom they oftener learn diſguiſe, and little low cunning, than any good qualities. They are often taught to ſay their prayers in a language which they don't underſtand; and addreſs their God by way of getting by rote a French leſſon: to be able to retain a few phraſes in the ſame tongue, is thought of more conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence than any thing elſe, and a converſation in their own is ſtrictly forbidden: the breach of which command is puniſhed as a great fault. The minds of girls are much more pliant than the minds of boys, and may, in their
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:015584_0075_0F9990EC04F7BA80"/>
childhood, be moulded which way you pleaſe: how neceſſary then is it to give them a right turn, to inſtil into their tender nature every principle of virtue and goodneſs. Having once inſpired them with that univerſal benevolence, which is the ſpirit of Chriſtianity, politeneſs and complaiſance will, in a great degree, be taught by it; and a few forms, which may be ſoon acquired, is all that is wanting to make compleat good breeding.</p>
            <p>I am far from thinking that women ſhould be taught no kind of literature, or believing they will make worſe miſtreſſes of families for having more learning than their cookmaid: on the contrary, I think they are the fitter for the office, as I imagine every man of ſenſe will wiſh his wife to be not merely a domeſtic, but a friend and companion; for which reaſon I would recommend ſuch ſtudies as tend to enlarge the underſtanding, improve the ideas, and entertain the ſoul with the beauties of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and virtue. Oeconomy and houſewifery are neceſſary branches of female education, and works of ingenuity and fancy may fill up the leiſure hours, both innocently and agreeably: thoſe who have a ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="77" facs="unknown:015584_0076_0F9990EE62E9B2C8"/>
encouraged; but it is ridiculous for one who has neither voice or ear to throw away that time in forcing nature which might be ſpent to more uſeful purpoſes.</p>
            <p>In fine, the great end of education is to teach us the true knowledge of the Deity, and through that knowledge to love and adore Him; and, as much as our finite natures will let us, to imitate the bright example He has ſet us. Which that we may all do, God of his infinite mercy grant, through Jeſus Chriſt. AMEN.</p>
