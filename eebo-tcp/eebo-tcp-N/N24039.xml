            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE words are choſen in honour of General FISKE, whoſe elogium I am this day to pronounce. The Scriptures every where pay a tribute to character, in order to pay a juſt tribute to truth. Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory lives in great men, as well as in great events, and it cannot do juſtice to the one, without the other. The moſt ſimple chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology is that of lives; and laws take not plainer dates from the reign of princes, than great actions do from the times of great men. Surely then the ſilence will not be required of religion, which truth
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:031800_0005_0FEE72E08CC91DF8"/>has denied to hiſtory. We may pay the debt of friendſhip, and form the love of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, in the memory of the dead. The good man will aſk no apology, and no other man can deſerve one. It is the privilege of virtue to be dear in the recollection, and to have glory from paſt actions.</p>
            <p>A peculiar obligation ariſes on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent occaſion, from the diſtinguiſhed ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices which our departed friend perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for this religious ſociety. The ſpirit of our times had required a change from a pariſh, to that of an incorporation of the proprietors in this houſe of worſhip. Other parts of the town enjoyed ſuch pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, and many inhabitants were bound by local reſidence to ſupport a miniſter in the pariſh, who had other engagements. To obtain a law to diſſolve the pariſh was eaſy, but to change the proprietors of the houſe ſo as to provide ſuch as were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to the ſettlement and ſupport of a
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031800_0006_0FEF2819D9EB77B0"/>miniſter, was difficult. The work muſt be accompliſhed by ſlow degrees, and in this time, the ſupport of a miniſter muſt be very precarious. It muſt depend upon generous exertion, and require ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive friend to perſevere in firm, but mild meaſures, till the end was attained. Such was our deceaſed friend, and his liberality on the occaſion was unbounded. He was conſtant, conſiſtent, and competent in ſuch ſervices, and attained his wiſhes without diviſion, or contention. His en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to eſtabliſh, what he had ſo lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dably aſſiſted to create, were uniform, till an apoplectic ſhock diſenabled him from any important ſervices in our intereſt. We may then, with the greateſt juſtice, unite with his fellow citizens in comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morating the event of the paſt week, in the death of an HONOURABLE MAN.</p>
            <p>Major General JOHN FISKE was born in this town, on the 10th day of April,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031800_0007_0FEE72E359A70FF8"/>1744. His father was miniſter of the firſt church, which was, at his ordination, the only church within the limits of the town. He was a man of eminent talents in the pulpit, of a firm and perſevering mind, and of great ambition. He mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into one of the moſt flouriſhing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the town, and was in very high eſteem, till diſſenſions in the ſociety, from the ill defined diſcipline of our churches, interrupted the harmony, and prevented his uſefulneſs. <note n="*" place="bottom">Samuel Fiſke, ordained October 8, 1718, died in Salem, April 7, 1770, Aet. 81.</note> Among his children, was the gentleman we lament. John was baptized on the 6th of May, by his uncle Nathan Bucknam, of Medway, in the firſt church in Salem. This venerable man, lately deceaſed, nearly finiſhed a century of years. <note n="†" place="bottom">He died, in his charge at Medway, in February, 1795. Aet. 92.</note> Debarred from the hopes of living in the miniſtry, the Father was obliged to provide for his children in the uſual buſineſs of life, and his ſon, with a
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031800_0008_0FEE72E62746D710"/>common education, early engaged in the buſineſs of the ſea, and having great ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs and happy talents for this employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he ſoon became able to obtain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion. He married for the firſt time in June 1766 to a daughter of a Deacon in this church, in whom he found a worthy wife, and the mother of his children. She deceaſed in 1782, and he afterwards mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a daughter of Col. Lee of Mancheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, with whom he lived only two years. He then married his preſent wife, with whom he lived happily, and from whom he experienced all the kind offices which were ſo neceſſary in the laſt years of his life. <note n="*" place="bottom">He married Lydia Phippen, June 12, 1766, who died October 13, 1782. He married the widow Martha Hibbert, daughter of Col. John Lee, of Mancheſter, February 11, 1783, who died No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember 30, 1785. He then married the widow Sarah Oerry, of Marblehead, daughter of Major John Wendell, of Boſton, June 18, 1786. His ſurviving children are Anna, Elizabeth, and John, Elizabeth married Ebenezer Putnam, M. A. ſon of Ebenezer Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, phyſician, of Salem, lately deceaſed. They have one child.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Soon after he became eaſy in his cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031800_0009_0FEE72E8EC3692B0"/>the American Civil War com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced. His intrepidity and ambition ſoon marked him out, as capable of uſeful ſervices to his country, and he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a commander in the ſervice of the State, in one of the veſſels then fitted for ſea, and held the firſt commiſſion. The natural warmth of his temper could never controul the generous ſentiments of his heart. Even in times of war, he felt the great difference between the liberty of the law, which public exigencies might give to private veſſels on the high ſeas, and the authority it could have in the name of the State to capture veſſels of the enemy. Of a commiſſion he thought moſt highly, and the moſt generous conduct reſulted from the pride, which this opinion inſpired. Our feeble marine force could atchieve nothing greater than to interrupt the trade of the enemy, and this might be done without inſult, and inhumanity. At the cloſe of the war, he eſtabliſhed himſelf as
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031800_0010_0FEE72EBAE8A7978"/>a merchant. As he roſe in life, from the employments of navigation, he connected his character as a merchant, immediately with ſhips in commerce, and extended his voyages, as the enterpriſing ſpirit of the times, and his own ambition led him, and had he not poſſeſſed from early life an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common generoſity, he muſt have riſen to as ſplendid wealth, as has ever been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed in our country. In his buſineſs, he ſoon became diſtinguiſhed by his generous encouragement to all whom he employed. He never appeared more ſincerely happy, than when the maſters of his veſſels grew rich, and never diſcovered more earneſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, than to promote ſuch as had been faithful in his employment. Punctuality with the tradeſmen, he moſt highly valued, and his contracts were generous, never op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive, and ſeldom of leſs than equal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, to all who formed them. He carefully obſerved an annual ſettlement and arrangement of all his affairs, and no
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031800_0011_0FEE72EE703C34A0"/>merchant could provide more amply for the accuracy of his papers, or the order and juſt ſeries of his books of account. And he ſuffered no perſons to be engaged in this ſervice, who had not adequate hopes of advantage from their fidelity. No man therefore could be more loved by his clerks and maſters. All are ready to atteſt the warmth of affection, which they have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
            <p>His buſineſs kept him from any thoughts of civil offices in the ſtate, but no man ever paid greater veneration to the ſervants of the people. He always ſpake of places of truſt, as offices of the higheſt honour, and he religiouſly guarded againſt the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to extend the cenſure of a bad man, to any office he might hold in the ſtate. Our chief magiſtrates, our judges, and men of every office found him reſpectful to all the honours, which the ſtate could confer, and diſcovered that ſuch honours
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031800_0012_0FEE72F2750F9288"/>were ſure claims of the higheſt attention from his enlightened patriotiſm.</p>
            <p>But though confined by his attention to buſineſs, in his wiſhes of civil promotion, no man was more attentive to the police, and the proſperity of the town, in which he lived. As an officer of the town he was always uſeful; always ready; and always employed. In the adminiſtration of the public charities, no man contributed more to the moſt happy arrangements, to the kindeſt attentions, and to the general ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the poor. No part of the eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy was forgotten by him. Every thing paſſed before his own eyes. He entered into the condition and claims of the loweſt, and was as punctual and faithful, as in his own higheſt concerns. Upon the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional contributions in the Congregation, he has been known to aſſiſt liberally in the collection; to have added repeatedly in the arrangements; and then again in the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031800_0013_0FEE72F4038C9990"/>diſtribution, and has then ſaid, "It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed more than uſual, but while one want is unſupplied, it is not enough."</p>
            <p>For the Schools he always expreſſed the moſt ſacred regard, and he was very active in obtaining that late eſtabliſhment, from which the town derives ſo much honour, and ſo general ſatisfaction. He inſpected the building of the new Schools, and encouraged with great zeal the public Schools for the inſtruction of Females. He always had an high opinion of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truſt of a Schoolmaſter, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore always was zealous for the moſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple compenſation of their labours. The Schoolmaſters have loſt a diſtinguiſhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor. The exemplary induſtry, and juſt economy of this town, had ſubjected it to falſe charges reſpecting its hoſpitality. The ſilent and reſerved manners ſo natural to its employments, and to a town, which has ſo very little inland trade, had given
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031800_0014_0FEE72F6BB7730B8"/>occaſion to ſuch reports. It was the duty of men, who could unite with application to buſineſs, happy opportunities for leiſure, to remove ungenerous prejudices. For this duty, our friend was eminently quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied. The habits of buſineſs were eaſy to him, and his affairs were well arranged, while his love of ſociety had never been impaired by his great induſtry and activity. He therefore opened his houſe to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all nations. He received viſits freely from all ſtrangers, recommended to him, and ſearched out the wants of all, who entered the town. In his extenſive ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to men of every rank and deſcription, he remains unequalled.</p>
            <p>He had been always taught to aſſociate the influence of good morals with religious inſtitutions of public inſtruction, and therefore at public worſhip he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. No excuſes ſufficed for him. But with religious opinions he had formed no
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031800_0015_0FEE72F976B109A0"/>enmities. He never thought men, who differed from him, were fools or knaves. He had a perſuaſion that religious opinions depend not on names, but upon ſincere inquiry, for their beſt influence, and that an honeſt mind might be ſo circumſtanced, as to admit the moſt abſurd doctrines, and be uncharitable in the defence of them, while there might be great benevolence in the native purpoſes of the heart. He therefore loved all men, who acted in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, and never found his own heart leſs ſenſible, nor his hand leſs ready, from the opinions, condition, or prejudices of any men. Few men can preſerve this genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of mind, with greater freedom from caprice. No haſty expreſſion was hard to recall, and no fudden purpoſe was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to check his bounty; and when he acted, he was ſure to do what was honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. He felt the claims of humanity riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above all the diſtinctions of civil life, and he had one law for all mankind.</p>

The kind opinion of his fellow citizens marked him out for all the honours they could confer. His promotion was una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable. They knew his ambition to give the higheſt ſucceſs to all his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, and could not refuſe to urge him to many important ſervices. The ſtate of the militia, the boaſt, as it ought to be the defence of Republics, then under many diſcouragements, required a man of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, and bold exertion. The laws of the militia were examined with great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, and the contrary opinions all tended to inſubordination. A man of a diſintereſted ſpirit was neceſſary to quiet the public mind, and to overrule prejudices in regard to a ſubject upon which the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſenſe is not yet determined. After his public appearance he ſoon roſe to the higheſt preſerment. He became Colonel of the Regiment in 1788. In July 1789 he was elected, and commiſſioned Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier General, and in 1792 became Major
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031800_0017_0FEE72FEF9957C50"/>General. Under his patronage began an aſſociation of the Military Officers, which has been very favourable to private friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, as well as conducive to the ambition of a military command, while it much increaſed the diſpoſition for the neceſſary ſubordination.</p>
            <p>While employed in organiſing and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the militia, he was not forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the merchants, and the members of the Marine Society. This inſtitution, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for the charitable aſſiſtance of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed mariners and their families, embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced alſo the liberal deſign of promoting every thing uſeful to navigation, and of preſerving and communicating all diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries and occurrences on the voyages of the members, as well as of receiving all plans to facilitate the navigation of this port. The Marine Society was formed in 1766, reviſed its laws in 1784, and again corrected them in 1790. After the death
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031800_0018_0FEE7301C0779548"/>of that worthy man, Captain Jonathan Gardner, in 1791, our friend was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſucceſſour, as Preſident, or Maſter of the Society. Under ſo active an officer, its ſpirit revived. It was not long after the appointment, convenient piers were raiſed to guard againſt the dangers and the delays of a narrow and ſhallow channel to our wharves, and the ſtately beacon ſoon appeared at the entrance of the harbour, which promoted from its known utility, the petition for the new light houſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready erected. The funds have increaſed, and this Society is now one of the moſt flouriſhing and reputable in the State.</p>
            <p>But to teach us the uncertain proſpects of life, while he was projecting the boldeſt deſigns for the proſperity of Salem, he had a ſtroke of apoplexy, which put an end to his uſefulneſs. The evil had ſo affected the brain in June 1795, that the hopes of recovery were loſt. It was attended with
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031800_0019_0FEE73047A0A8D10"/>great loſs of memory, and with great ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of mind, when he firſt awoke from ſleep, and increaſed into an entire derange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But in his moſt deranged ſtate, he was full of great deſigns for mankind, and never betrayed a narrow thought, or one ungenerous purpoſe on any occaſion. The aid of phyſicians in town and country was ſought in vain, and the ſhocks were repeated, till an entire debility enſued, and at laſt the powers of ſpeech failed, and in a violent fit of apoplexy, he expired at two o'clock on Thurſday laſt, the 28th day of September.</p>
            <p>Various cauſes have been aſſigned, of a calamity, which arreſted a man, of ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently firm conſtitution, in the midſt of his hopes and uſefulneſs. But the effects do not ſo well correſpond with the events, which occurred in his domeſtic circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and his ſecular concerns, as to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us, that they were the remote, or
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031800_0020_0FEE7307401DD8A0"/>immediate cauſes of his ſufferings. The repeated breaches in his family, and the depredations on his property at ſea, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly diſtreſſed him, but his natural cheerfulneſs, and the property he ſtill poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, relieved him from the worſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions. From an intimate acquaintance, and an impartial inquiry, and from daily obſervation, it may be preſumed, and from the hiſtory of his family and conſtitution, that what he ſuffered aroſe from no moral cauſe, and from no anxiety of mind, but from the nature of that diſorder, which has ſo often arreſted the beſt and moſt active men, and which did arreſt on the paſt week a worthy gentleman of the ſame rank at the head of his diviſion, and in the public diſcharge of his duty. <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. Hull at the review in Concord. He has ſince recovered of this ſhock.</note>
            </p>
            <p>High as may be our eſteem of him in his public offices, we ſhall not value him
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031800_0021_0FEE730B286965E0"/>leſs, when we obſerve his diſpoſition in domeſtic life. In his firſt years, he was called to repay the cares of his aged pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, when he might have hoped to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for his own advancement. The joy as well as fidelity with which he diſcharged this duty, is well known, and has been the ſubject of many a prophecy among the aged, reſpecting God's bleſſings upon him Such an ingenuous affection diſplays his worth in an unequivocal manner.</p>
            <p>As an Huſband, he paſſed in quick ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion through various ſcenes, all of which were adapted to explain the firm habits of his mind. In the wife of his youth, he had ſweet endearment. The ſhort ſcene of gay, and fond life, which ſucceeded, ſerved to fix his love of ſocial joy, and the amiable virtues of his laſt companion were rich bleſſings upon the laſt ſcene of his uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in the hours which called for ſympathy, fidelity, and the ſevereſt duty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:031800_0022_0FEE730CAFC42640"/>
Of ſympathy he felt all the cruelty, and yet he commanded all the virtue. His children were dear to him. They roſe into life, but periſhed at the hour they ripened. An accompliſhed daughter of his hopes completed her education, and returned to her parents, to embrace them, and to die. He ſaw the fond mother in one of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and found another home, but this expectation was ſoon loſt. The mother and the babes ſoon paſſed to the ſilence of the grave. Yet another ſmiled on the world, and bid a ſpeedy farewell in youth and innocence. In theſe ſcenes, he was tender, yet reſigned. He with increaſed affection united to thoſe who remained with him, and as the circle became ſmall, he filled it more with his preſence and his love. His manners were kind, and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, and commanded reſpect. He was fond, eaſily excited to pity, but had a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in his tears. Superiour to complaint, he liſtened to the complaints of other men,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031800_0023_0FEE30A7959FCC10"/>and engaged their confidence. Without fraud, his language ſeldom required an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation, and did not admit concealed purpoſes of evil. He never valued his friendſhip, till he had proved it, and never believed his own ſincerity, till he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged every obligation. Juſtice with him was all the good in his power. He was fond of favour, but he endeavoured to deſerve it. He loved men, rather than opinions, <note n="*" place="bottom">He profeſſed the Unitarian doctrine.</note> and he deſired to know more of their actions, than of ther profeſſions. As a juſt tribute, it may be ſaid, that in his friendſhips, he was conſtant. Few men, ſo much in the world, knew ſo little of being in and out of favour. No reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made him deny any man's merit, and no enmity made him refuſe to ſerve him. He blamed errour only when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in. He made it the intereſt of his friends to forſake it, and judged of their ſincerity by their actions. No explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031800_0024_0FEE730E37ED2768"/>debarred them from a return. He lived and died, as truly as any man ever did, the friend of all mankind.</p>
            <p>We freely inquire reſpecting the perſon of a man, whom we are taught to love. General Fiſke, in his perſon, was of fine proportions; handſome; in his manners eaſy; had a dignity in his motions, and could command reſpect. He had a benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in his countenance, while his eye was lofty, quick, and expreſſive. In his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, he was often impetuous; but ſoon calmed. Always ſure of his motives, he was able to correct his natural fire from the heart. He never concealed his faults, confeſſed them, but roſe above them by great virtues. When moſt zealous, he was moſt benevolent, and he could never be ſudden, but when he had purpoſes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant good in his actions. His ſteps, his ſoul inſtantly partook of all his emotions, and he was all in every thing. His ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:031800_0025_0FEE731252A67D88"/>was never dangerous, for it had no guilt. His fondneſs for praiſe, made him deſerve it, and his pleaſures were purely ſocial. In his conſtitution he was firm, in his natural ſtrength great, in his muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles athletic. The conformation of his face had ſtrong lines, but he could not long preſerve any angry emotion. He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered his ſoul in his perſon, as much as in his actions.</p>
            <p>When we conſider the benefits, which mankind have derived from the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, we are convinced, that it is in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of divine providence, to accompliſh the beſt deſigns for men, by the generous, and enlightened few, who appear in the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ages of the world. No man has been able to exhibit that equality of talents, which qualifies all men to be equally uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, enterpriſing and ſucceſsful in any ſtate of ſociety. Such circumſtances muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine, ſuch habits be formed, and ſuch ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:031800_0026_0FEE731657F5E170"/>zeal muſt exiſt, as can command the paſſions of mankind. In every coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in every purſuit, in every thing excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, this has been the privilege of few men, and therefore it may be conſidered as a peculiar bleſſing to any ſociety, when ſuch men are allied to its intereſt. Such indiſputably was the friend whom we have this day in grateful remembrance, and whom we in the paſt week, followed, with the higheſt honours, to the tomb. To commemorate real worth, is to create it. Great examples develope character, and inſpire virtue. The prophet celebrated in the text, was thus honourable. He knew the people were ignorant and corrupt; that a diſpoſition for change was not to be reſiſted; that he was in danger from envy, competition, and intereſt. That the ſafe path to preſent eaſe was by flattery, conſent, and conformity. Had he yielded, he could not have uttered that generous appeal by which he has been rendered im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal.
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:031800_0027_0FEE7317E6922D10"/>Hiſtory could not have reported any thing great or honourable of ſuch a man. He therefore yielded to the generous purpoſes of his own heart. He did every good thing in his power. He was crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the love, and rewarded with the proſperity of an whole nation. May we never forget the richneſs of the reward, or the glory of the ſervice.</p>
            <p>In ſuch recitals, the ſcriptures are true to hiſtory. In all enlightened nations, ſuch names are recorded at every eventful period. Conſult even the hiſtory of the church. FATHERS have been reverenced in the primitive ages. We give this name to eminent men. If ſuperſtition has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached itſelf to great names, it is not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe men have been ungrateful, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not philoſophers. If men have reverenced great, though perverted talents, it was becauſe they knew more of great talents, than of truth. The moſt
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:031800_0028_0FEE73196FDA7918"/>memorable ſuperſtition is ignorance grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to reward great zeal in the ſervice of mankind. In the reformation, we cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the ſucceſsful labours of men, indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant at oppreſſion. There have been as great men ſince, and more enlightened. When men are determined to do good, God always ſays, it ſhall proſper.</p>
            <p>But why ſhould we ſearch antient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords? Why ſhould we explore diſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions? The world is but one volume, and our own country has inſtructive pages open to our view. Our fathers boldly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſed. We reſpect their names with gratitude. They have left no monuments, but in the memory of their labours. Their ſons have ariſen, have enlightened and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed their country. Every where, there has been virtue, and glory. A father has begun a ſettlement, and has given his name, his character, and his hopes to all around him. In the ſtate, the city, and
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:031800_0029_0FEE731D67D9FB08"/>the field, men ariſe to enſure the rewards of public gratitude. We are not without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples in all our various communities. <note n="*" place="bottom">The funeral diſcourſes lately printed in this county, upon the death of the Hon. Azor Orne, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>. of Marblehead, and of Col. John Low, of Glouceſter, expreſs the public ſentiment.</note> The obligations are univerſally known. A diſplay of genius, is the developement of the human powers, by the force of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in which they are placed. We ſee not the full ſtrength of every man's capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, nor do we ſuppoſe, that the man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed in ſome circumſtances, would have been eminent in all. A great man ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and he diffuſes light around him. He kindles up new ſuns to ſhine with native ſplendour, and genius has its glory. So a man of generous goodneſs gives his faireſt character to the regions in which he has his habitation. This is confirmed in the hiſtory of the human mind. One mind <note n="†" place="bottom">Locke.</note> employed on the human underſtanding,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:031800_0030_0FEE73215B9AECD0"/>has given exalted wiſdom to this divine philoſophy. The <note n="*" place="bottom">Newton.</note> principles of a philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher have diſcloſed the laws of nature. The pulpit <note n="†" place="bottom">Age of Louis XIV.</note> was inſtructed in the laſt age, and humanity <note n="‡" place="bottom">Howard.</note> in the preſent. We all know the date of theſe events, when we commence our ſtudies. Common minds follow up theſe eminent men to their laſt diſcoveries, and if they cannot paſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond, they make familiar the path, which has been opened. So when a good exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of life has been fairly exhibited, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſtretch of the human powers, men advance freely, and poſſeſs the beſt attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Not half the labour is required to render men wiſe, which was neceſſary to confirm them in errour and ignorance.</p>
            <p>And may we not confirm the ſame hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the virtues? One man teaches an whole nation to be brave. One man diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes a ſpirit of induſtry around him. One
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:031800_0031_0FEE7322E682CF78"/>man forms a love of order, and of peace. There is no virtue, which cannot diſpoſſeſs the moſt inveterate errours, when it is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in ſome great example. Men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come proud of the imitation. Cruel is the attempt to confine them to the meaſure of ſcanty virtue. When they copy in ſtrength of deſire, they produce with ſure ſucceſs, the higheſt virtues of our nature. It is enough to know where men live, under what influence they are directed, to know what is the meaſure of their hopes and of their virtues.</p>
            <p>And muſt not then the progreſs of ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty depend upon generous minds? The half taught parent muſt err in the moſt ſimple leſſons of truth. The mind of the child cannot be happily expanded. The unqualified inſtructor delays the viſits of knowledge till ſome future generation. The darkneſs of his own mind prevents truth from ſhining upon the world. But
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:031800_0032_0FEE732879DD7230"/>when his underſtanding is clear, he raiſes men to his own attainments, and grand elevation. They riſe then with greater eaſe, than they could have grovelled below. This truth is not only clear, but momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous. It is too much forgotten in the fooliſh ſatisfaction with paſt ignorance.</p>
            <p>And ſhall not we take a leſſon from this truth, as illuſtrated in the example of our friend? We have ſeen a generous man. We knew his ſervices, and we confeſs his influence. Should we ever deſcend to things which are mean, we ſhall act unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the moſt juſt expectations. It is an happy reflection that our friend found ample ſupport in ſome men, who poſſeſs the ſame virtues. We truſt that they will continue to recommend the laudable prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples they have adopted. May they act upon their enlightened underſtandings, and while they remember the good things in their power, may they be in love with their higheſt duty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:031800_0033_0FEE732B3AC85318"/>
Conſider the worth of our departed friend, and then can you wonder at our tears? Can you expect that we ſhould have the laſt ſight of our deareſt friend, and not weep? that after an intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, conſtant ſervices, and uniform affection, we ſhould forget the man, who has done ſo much to make us happy, and ſhould ſeparate without anguiſh? We are not ſo taught by our pureſt affections. Nor do we expect to be forſaken in our tears. Many will crowd around us, to partake in our ſorrows. They will know our loſs, and mourn with us the death of an HONOURABLE MAN. They who have been aſſiſted, while entering into life, and have experienced the care of a benefactor, they will lament the man who ſo heartily rejoiced in their proſperity. The poor will remember that they are no longer to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him, who has ſo often adminiſtered relief to their wants. The mariner will think of him, who has ſo often ſent charity
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:031800_0034_0FEE732E0D3F8A60"/>to the houſe, from which the huſband was abſent, or to which he could never return. While the ſoldier will paſs in thought, over the joy, which his general and his friend could inſpire. Every good man will mourn, when the friends of public happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs forſake the world. But whatever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections good men may indulge upon the melancholy changes of human life, they who have lived in the intimate affections muſt diſcharge the duties of the ſevereſt ſympathy. We condole, in ſincerity, with the bereaved widow, who is ſeparated from the man, ſhe loved. Her piety, her exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary patience, and her ſublime hopes will carry her to her God. The more rich our gifts, the greater the duty of reſignation. Religion exalts the duty, while the greateſt bleſſings form the ſevereſt obligation. We compaſſionate an aged relative, <note n="*" place="bottom">Madam King, ſiſter of his mother, and living in his family.</note> who has ſhared his love, and found in his houſe, a quiet habitation. We pity an infirm bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:031800_0035_0FEE7330D1F79818"/>who has loſt the beſt of friends. We look with anxious concern to his ſiſters, who have received bountifully from his unceaſing goodneſs. We behold a mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing family. May that ſweet virtue, which in a daughter's heart, has lived to ſupport a father in his infirmities, and to reward his affections, in his own boſom, find am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple reward from the pureſt bleſſings of Heaven. May the ſon ſee the father's vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, and emulate them. May this tender ſcene confirm the young daughter in all the duties of her domeſtic affections, and the renewed <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. P. married two daughters of the general, ſucceſſively.</note> obligations of her huſband urge his heart to the lovely cares which devolve upon him. May all the friends take the beſt leſſons of life, and be wiſe unto ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The calls of ſuch a ſeaſon of mourning are loud. We ſee where the proudeſt hopes of the preſent life do end, and the glory of the Chriſtian. We learn the beſt recommendation of mutual love,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:031800_0036_0FEE733391F899E8"/>and the only pure conſolations of our dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moments. We ſoften our hearts by the tribute of ſympathy, and underſtand the true honour of our character. May we imitate what is lovely in our friends, and receive with them an everlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. May virtue inſpire our hope of heaven, and our pureſt joys be more perfect pleaſures of benevolence, which on earth we have learned to enjoy with delight.</p>
