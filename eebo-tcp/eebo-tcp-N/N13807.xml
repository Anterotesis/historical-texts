            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>To the Law and to the Testimony: If they ſpeak not according to this Word, it is becauſe there is no Light in them.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>HAPPY are the people who live where divine revelation ſhines. This is not the portion of all the nations of the earth; <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old was thus favoured. "GOD ſhewed his word unto <hi>Jacob,</hi> his ſtatutes and his judgments unto <hi>Iſrael</hi>: He hath not dealt ſo with any nations, and as for his judgments they have not known them(<hi>a</hi>)". Since the Pſalmiſt thus expreſſed himſelf, GOD has been pleaſed to make a clearer and more explicit reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation or his will; contained in what is called the New Teſtament, this revelation <hi>we</hi> enjoy together with <hi>that</hi> which was anciently given to the <hi>Jews.</hi> But whilſt this is our happy ſtate, a great part of the world ſtill lies in darkneſs, they have nothing but the light of nature to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, they "ſet in the region and ſhadow of death <hi>(b),"</hi> they grope in the dark, they "ſeek the LORD, by the dim taper of reaſon, if haply they might feel after him and find him <hi>(c)".</hi> Whilſt this is the ſad condition of many of the nations around us, we have the bleſſedneſs of "the people that know the joyful ſound <hi>(d)".</hi> The ſovereignty of GOD is to be adored in the diſcrimination that he has made among the nations of the earth; and greatly is he to be praiſed that he has ſo highly favoured us above many people, who by nature were equal, and perhaps on other accounts ſuperior to ourſelves. Well may we adopt the words of our bleſſed Saviour and ſay, "we thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, becauſe thou
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017449_0004_0FA11DD332C8DAC0"/>
haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them to us babes. Even ſo Father, for ſo it hath ſeemed good in thy ſight<note n="(e)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> xi. 25.</note>." This revelation thus grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us, is tranſmitted down in writing. Now all writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is in a greater or leſs degree uncertain. This is eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially true of all ancient compoſitions. Obſcurity is produced by length of time. An additional happineſs, therefore, do we enjoy in having an order of men, divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appointed, to explain, as well as to inculcate and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force, this <hi>word</hi> and <hi>will</hi> of GOD. The ignorance of a very conſiderable part of mankind, and the ambiguity of all kinds of writing being properly conſidered, it muſt appear a mighty privilege to have a ſet of men, whoſe <hi>leiſure</hi> and <hi>education</hi> ſhall enable them, in ſome degree, to unfold the doctrinal truths of this writen revelation. Were multitudes upon reading the <hi>ſcriptures,</hi> to be aſked, as Phillip of old aſked the Eunuch, "underſtandeſt thou what thou readeſt?" they like him muſt anſwer, "how can I except ſome man guide me<note n="(f)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> viii. 30.</note>!" Though the Old and New Teſtament be, in the moſt important parts thereof, ſufficiently intelligible, yet there are not only in St. Paul's epiſtles, but in other books of ſcripture, "ſome things hard to be underſtood, which the ignorant and unſtable are liable to wreſt to their own deſtruction<note n="(g)" place="bottom">2. <hi>Pet.</hi> iii. 16.</note>." The wiſdom and goodneſs of GOD, therefore, are moſt devoutly to be acknowledged in the inſtitution of the goſpel miniſtry. But alas! the beſt appointments are liable to be corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Miniſters, whoſe ſole buſineſs it is to explain and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force the doctrines of ſcripture, ſometimes groſsly miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent them. When this is the caſe, lamentable is the condition of thoſe people who ſet under them. If the "leaders of the people cauſe them to err, thoſe that are led of them will be deſtroyed<note n="(h)" place="bottom">Iſaiah <hi>ix. 16.</hi>
               </note>." If "they whoſe lips ſhould preſerve knowledge, and at whoſe mouths the people ſhould ſeek the law, are ignorant or erronious," then the "blind lead the blind and both will fall into the ditch." The light ſhould be in the head, "but if the light that is therein be darkneſs, how great is that dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<note n="(i)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Math.</hi> vi. 23.</note>?" The prophet Iſaiah, conſcious of theſe things,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017449_0005_0FA11DD3F176E720"/>
calls upon all that pretended to ſpeak in the name of the LORD to have recourſe not to <hi>familiar ſpirits and wizards that peep and mutter, but to the law and the teſtimony, and declared that if they ſpeak not according to that word, it was becauſe there was no light in them.</hi> From the words thus introduced I ſhall attempt the following things.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That it is the duty of the miniſters of religion to preach and ſpeak both <hi>publickly</hi> and <hi>privately</hi> agreeably to the ſcriptures of truth.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Shew that ſometimes they depart therefrom, and particularly point out when they may be ſaid to do ſo.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Mention ſome of the reaſons why miniſters do not always ſpeak agreeably to the divine law and teſtimony. And then conclude with a ſuitable application.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt of theſe particulars, a few words will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. We all agree that "miniſters are in ſome peculiar <hi>ſenſe put in trust with the people, and are ſtewards of the myſteries of GOD."</hi> It is acknowledged very generally, that as the canon of ſcripture is completed; ſo viſions, inſpirations, prophecies and miracles have ceaſed. Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have at this day no ſuch extraordinary powers as they were veſted with, in the days of the Apoſtles; ſo that if there were need of a new revelation, or an addition to the old one, there are no perſons capacitated to undertake the mighty taſk. But there is no ſuch neceſſity. The ſcripture is full and complete. When the revelation of <hi>John</hi> the divine on the iſland of PATMOS ended, the canon of ſcripture was cloſed, and a curſe denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the preſumptuous wretch "that ſhould dare to add <hi>to</hi> or diminiſh therefrom; his part ſhould be taken away from the book of life." Since therefore no addition is to be made to divine revelation, the <hi>ſtewards of the myſteries of GOD</hi> have nothing elſe to do, than explain and incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate <hi>that</hi> which we now enjoy. They are not to make a new, but rationally to interpret the bible we at preſent poſſeſs. They are to come to their people, with a "thus ſaith the LORD;" and no further are they to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, then as they ſpeak according to the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Teſtimony. Theſe</hi> ſhould not only be the foundation of their preaching, but frequent recurrence ſhould be made thereto; and all their diſcourſes, on topicks dubious and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017449_0006_0FA11DD4B23AFE58"/>
diſputable ſhould ever be vindicated and ſupported by paſſages of revelation, conſiſtently interpreted. As the ſcriptures are a complete rule of faith and practice, ſo no knowledge more than what is contained in them, is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation. Other knowledge indeed is convenient and ornamental, and ſtudiouſly to be ſought after; but it is no further uſeful to the goſpel miniſters than as it is a <hi>hand-maid</hi> to divinity, and ſerves to illucidate the dark and intricate parts of revelation. It is highly neceſſary for this purpoſe; and the moſt learned divine is qualified, and (other things being equal) will be, the beſt miniſter. But if his extenſive knowledge leads him aſtray (as it muſt be confeſſed it ſometimes does) by indulging to ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations of his own, and hearkening to the vagaries of a conceited mind, then in all important points, it may be ſaid that there is no light in him; none that conduces to the ſalvation of his hearers, none that will be profitable to himſelf, in <hi>the great day of the LORD.</hi> Theſe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, ſhowing it to be the duty of public teachers, to make the ſcriptures the rule and meaſure of their preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we find confirmed not only by my text, but alſo by the <hi>expreſs</hi> and <hi>direct aſſertion</hi> of St. Peter, who ſays, "If any man ſpeak, let him ſpeak as the oracles of GOD<note n="(k)" place="bottom">1. <hi>Pet.</hi> iv. 11.</note>", ſince in the ſacred ſcriptures we have "a ſure word of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, and are perſuaded that we have not followed cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly deviſed fables, certainly we ſhould do well to take heed thereunto," not only make them the men of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, but the rule of our preaching. But though from ſcripture, and the reaſon of the thing, it is ſufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that miniſters are obligated to repreſent to their hearers only the truths and doctrines of divine revelation; yet ſome perſons fail of this deſign, and that in ſo great a degree as to render them unſafe and dangerous to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved or followed. Of this I propoſed to ſpeak in the ſecond head of my diſcourſe. And here to prevent miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, let it be obſerved, that among all the teachers of religion, none are to be found, who without error or miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, are capable perfectly to expound the law and will of GOD; neither are <hi>any two</hi> ever to be met with, who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017449_0007_0FA11DD57231F1F0"/>
in all points agree in the explanation of it. This is not to be expected. The lot of humanity will not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it: There are ſome things, even in ſcripture, of which we muſt be contentedly ignorant, till we drop this mortal fleſh, and arrive at the world of perfect viſion. This igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and imperfection of miniſters does not deſtroy the utility of their office. Neither are we to throw away any man, who as a public teacher, does not explain and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret every paſſage or doctrine of ſcripture, according to our own ſentiments. A man is not to be <hi>made an offender for a word.</hi> Allowances are to be made for the frailties of human nature. Freedom of enquiry is to be indulged; and great candour is to be exerciſed, by the people, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their miniſters. We are not haſtily to conclude, that a preacher is dangerouſly erronious, becauſe all his ſentiments do not co-incide with our pre-conceived opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
            <p>Though the exact knowledge of all parts of ſcripture would be highly pleaſing to the inquiſitive mind; yet miſtakes in many parts thereof, are conſiſtent with a ſtate of ſalvation. The future happineſs of our ſouls will not be prevented thereby. If an exact knowledge of divine revelation, in all its parts, were neceſſary to ſalvation, who then could be ſaved? All the important doctrines of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are ſo plainly revealed, that good men are generally agreed in them. Differences among miniſters are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times merely verbal; and (if they are otherwiſe) their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is <hi>moſtly</hi> about the more intricate and leſs impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant matters of revelation. But then, ſometimes it ſo happens that they widely and eſſentially differ; differ in matters highly important, by which the ſalvation of their own, and their hearers ſouls may be greatly endangered; if not finally loſt.</p>
            <p>Few miniſters are ever to be found, ſo corrupt and erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, but will ſometimes entertain their hearers, with the true and genuine doctrines of the goſpel. The difficulty and the danger with unſound teachers is, that they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mix falſhood with truth; and too much neglect plain, ſcriptural doctrines, for the ſake of preaching up the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and figments of their own diſtempered brains. The <hi>church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> is doubtleſs the moſt corrupt chriſtian
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017449_0008_0FA11DD633E06540"/>
church now in the world; yet it is well known that a part of their creed is agreeable to the belief of ſound pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, and to the ſtandard of ſcripture. Their error and danger lie principally in the human mixtures they have introduced, and the corrupt additions they have made, to the ſacred doctrines; as appears particularly from <hi>Pope Pius</hi>'s creed. That church holds to Chriſt as the head; they lay him in the foundation; but they have built on this foundation a moſt erronious ſtructure of error and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.

Their doctrines of <hi>tranſubſtantiation, invocation</hi> of ſaints, prayers to the <hi>virgin Mary; indulgences,</hi> prayers for the dead, <hi>penance, pilgrimages, auricular confeſſion,</hi> and a hundred other abſurdities, have ſo eaten out the vitals of chriſtianity, or at leaſt, have ſo corrupted the ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, obſcured the glory, and vailed the beauty of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, as to make that communion an extremely danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>one</hi>; and ſuch as we ought never to enter, even though we have no right to ſay that ſalvation cannot be had therein. This laſt ſuperſtructure, being compoſed of combuſtible materials, as <hi>wood, hay, ſtubble,</hi> will be burnt up; and the builders will ſuffer loſs, but themſelves may be ſaved; yet ſo, as by fire, that is with difficulty and narrowly, as goods are ſaved out of an houſe all in flames over our heads. The church of the Jews in the days of our Saviour, acted much the ſame part: They departed from the <hi>law</hi> and <hi>testimony.</hi> They <hi>tranſgreſſed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of GOD,</hi> and in many inſtances made them of no effect <hi>by their traditions,</hi> as our bleſſed LORD ſaid, and made evident. Their partial repreſentations, corrupt comments and gloſſes, enervated the ſcriptures, and tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to miſlead their hearers, and cauſe them to expect ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in a way in which it was not to be found. Leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſimplicity of the law, "they taught for doctrines the commandments of men<note n="(m)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> xv. 9.</note>". And as "the leaders of GOD's people anciently cauſed them to err," ſo it is no breach of charity to aſſert that this is ſometimes the caſe at
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:017449_0009_0FA11DD731B4D698"/>
the preſent day. There are thoſe among us who pervert the goſpel of CHRIST, who corrupt the word of GOD, and, even, in ſome inſtances, repreſent things ſo differently from the truth as it is in JESUS, that they may be ſaid to preach another goſpel." If ſometimes they entertain their hearers with the <hi>doctrines</hi> of <hi>grace clearly,</hi> and <hi>ſtrickingly</hi> repreſented, it nobly prepares their minds for the reception of their poiſonous errors, and greatly facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the entrance of pernicious falſhoods into them. In ſuch a caſe as this, the preacher, (if allowed to be erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous at all) is ſuppoſed by many to err on the right ſide; that it is only an exceſs of orthodoxy, that he has a good deſign, means to exalt the divine ſovereignty; and if he ſpeaks wickedly, does it for GOD." But however the errors of ſuch kind of teachers may be palliated and excuſed by a particular kind of hearers, yet it is much to be doubted whether they will be excuſed ſo eaſily at the bar of GOD. It is the duty of teachers to preach the truth, and nothing but the truth; to deliver the whole counſel of of GOD and keep back nothing that is profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble." What then ſhall we think of the man who oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally only preaches the genuine doctrines of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, whilſt the moſt of his time and zeal are expended in bringing into view a ſort of theology produced by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of pride and metaphiſic; as, one expreſſes it, a kind of Divinity "ſpun, as the ſpider does his web, out of his own bowels." Theſe things being obſerved in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, I would now particularly ſay, that a teacher of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion goes counter to the directions of my text, when he preaches things concerning which the bible is totally ſilent. This at once will exclude from the pulpit all diſcourſes of <hi>phyloſophy,</hi> aſtronomy, metaphiſics, &amp;c. For the ſcriptures were never deſigned to teach us any of the above ſciences.</p>
            <p>Again, the text is contradicted when a miniſter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines his time in the pulpit in endeavors to explain matters that are too wonderful for him; myſteries that are high and ſublime; to which he cannot attain; and on which it is impoſſible for him to throw any degree of light. The introducing the <hi>fine ſpun distinctions</hi> and <hi>curious explications</hi> of the <hi>ſchools</hi> into diſcourſes of divinity, has darkned rather then illuſtrated the doctrines of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Revelation has been adultrated, and it's benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent

purpoſe in ſome degree, obſtructed by this method of procedure. How vain are all attempts to explain the manner of CHRIST's conception in the womb of the Virgin Mary, by the overſhadowing of the Holy Ghoſt. How idle and futile are all pretended explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning the modes of the union between the two natures of Chriſt, commonly called the hypoſtatic union? Who is able to declare CHRIST's eternal genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; who can clearly and intelligibly ſhew how he was the Son of GOD, and how the ſon of man? how the ſpirit operates upon the hearts of men, and how he origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally proceeded from the Father and the Son? and what is the unity of the divine perſons, and what their differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Thoſe doctrines cannot be enlightened by any diſquiſitions of human reaſon. We believe them upon the authority of divine revelation and know no more about them, then that reveals. Nay, if the ſpirit of GOD had deſcended to a particular explanation of theſe myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous matters, we could not have comprehended his meaning, or gained any light, unleſs our minds had been enlarged. But this we know, that it was not the manner of our Saviour and his apoſtles to enter into any explanation of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible things, the ſcripture paſſes them over in profound ſilence; and ſo ought they who undertake to be the public diſpenſers of it. That this is extending our enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies to a latitude beyond what the bible will juſtify, might be illuſtrated by a multitude of inſtances; but to prevent being tedious, I ſhall ſelect only a few. And to go on; what avail all the diſtinctions <hi>divines</hi> have ſometimes made concerning the nature of <hi>grace,</hi> whether it differs in kind or degree, be <hi>ſpecial</hi> or <hi>common,</hi> influence the mind in one way or another? So long as we know that GOD will aſſiſt us, if we endeavour to ſerve him; and never wants means to effect his deſigns? Of what advantage are heated controverſies concerning the abilities of unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men? ſo long as we may reſt aſſured that they are commanded to love and obey GOD, and that GOD does not command impoſibilities, but his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand makes it our duty to do what we can, and his grace will be perfect in our weakneſs.</p>
            <p>That GOD is omniſcient, all agree; that all future events, even ſuch as are called contingent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are known by

him, long before they take place, is not diſputed. The preacher, who, not content with a<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="5 letters">
                  <desc>•••••</desc>
               </gap>ming that this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection belongs to GOD, undertakes to explain how the preſcience of the Deity does, or does not conſiſt with the liberty of man is wiſe above what is written, and oftentimes <hi>"darkens counſel by words without knowledge."</hi> And if the reſult of his ſpeculations on this head, ſhould be, that man is not a free agent in the common acceptation of the words, that his will is faſt bound in fate; that he has not a principle of efficiency, by which to determine his own volitions and actions, but like a machine is operated upon; that all his liberty conſiſts meerly in voluntarineſs and is by no means to be oppoſed to neceſſity, I ſay if the reſult of his reaſonings on the divine omniſcience, ſhould be ſuch as is repreſented above (nearly as has been in fact the caſe) then he departs from the <hi>law</hi> and <hi>teſtimony</hi> in a ſtill higher and more important ſenſe. In this caſe he not only ſpeaks where the ſcripture is ſilent; but really contradicts it in a point that is highly eſſential. He ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances an antiſcriptural doctrine, repugnant to the common ſenſe, reaſon and perception of mankind; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently highly improper to be preached. For though ſeveral people, and ſome very wicked ones too, have taught the doctrine of fate and neceſſity; and ſome of them evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently with a deſign to ſubvert all religion, and even the being of GOD; yet nothing can be plainer than that the reverlation of GOD to man, uniformly conſiders him as <hi>free,</hi> and addreſſes him from the beginning of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis</hi> to the end of the <hi>Apocalypſe,</hi> accordingly<note n="(n)" place="bottom">Though it is ſomewhat contrary to my preſent deſign to enter into any reaſoning on this point, yet as it is a matter that has employed the thoughts and pens of many writers, I will beg leave juſt to give the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the great and learned Dr. SAMUEL CLARKE, on it, ſpeaking of God's knowledge extending to the moſt contingent futurities, even the actions of free agents, he ſays, "There is in this matter one difficulty which has in all ages employed the ſpeculations of conſidering men; namely, how foreknowledge in God, can be conſiſtent with liberty of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in men." In anſwer to which, he ſays, "1ſt. That our finite under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding may reaſonably be allowed, not to be able to comprehend all the ways of infinite knowledge; Job xi. 7. "Can'ſt thou by ſcarching find out God? Canſt thou find out the Almighty unto perfection? &amp;c. This ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of the incomprehenſibleneſs of the ways of God muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be underſtood with relation to ſuch things only as do not imply any expreſs contradiction.—Alſo, it muſt be obſerved, that this acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement ought to be underſtood <hi>only</hi> of things, expreſsly revealed, not of any human doctrines. 2dly, It is furher neceſſary to promiſe that in the matter before us, the queſtion is not, whether men's actions be free; but whether or no, and how, that freedom of action which makes men to be men, can be conſiſtent with the foreknowledge of ſuch actions: for if theſe two things were really inconſiſtent, and could by no means be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled; it would follow, not that men's actions were not free; (for that would deſtroy all religion, and take away all the moral attributes of God at once;) but on the other ſide, it would follow, that ſuch free actions as men's are, and without which rational creatures could not be rational creatures, were not the objects of the divine foreknowledge. And in ſuch caſe, it would be no more a dimunition of God's omniſcience, not to know things impoſſible and contradictory to be known; than it is a dimunition of his omnipotence, not to be able to do things impoſſible and contradictory to be done: But this is not the caſe: For theſe two things being premiſed we may now anſwer directly to the difficulty itſelf, namely, how foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in God can be conſiſtent with liberty of action in men; and they are therefore conſiſtent, becauſe foreknowledge has no influence at-all upon the things foreknown; and it has therefore no influence upon them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe things would be juſt as they are, and not otherwiſe, if there was no foreknowledge. Foreknowledge does not cauſe things to be; but things that are to be hereafter, whether neceſſarily or freely, are the cauſe of it's being foreknown that they ſhould ſo be, whether neceſſarily or freely. The futurity of free actions is exactly the ſame, and in the nature of things themſelves, as the like certainty in event, whether they <hi>can</hi> or <hi>could not</hi> be foreknown. As our knowing a thing to be, when we ſee it is, does not hinder an action from being free, notwithſtanding it is then certain, and cannot but be, when it is: So God's foreknowing that any action will free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be done, does not at all hinder its being free, though he knows it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly; becauſe his foreſeeing things to come, does no more influence, or alter the nature of things, than our ſeeing them when they are.—The manner of God's knowing future free actions, muſt not indeed be, like his foreknowledge of things neceſſary. I ſay, it muſt not be by foreſeeing a continued chain of cauſes: For that would indeed deſtroy their freedom. But it muſt be a power, quite of another kind: a power, whereof we can only have an obſure glimpſe in ſome ſuch manner as the following. What one man will freely do, upon any particular occaſion, another man, by obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and attention, may in ſome meaſure judge; and the wiſer the perſon is, who makes the obſervation, the more probable will his judgment be, and the ſeldomer will he be deceived. An angel, in the like caſe, would make a judgment of the future event, as much nearer to certainty, than that of the wiſeſt man, as the angelic nature and faculties are ſuperior to the human. In God himſelf, whoſe powers are all in every reſpect infinitely tranſcending thoſe of the higheſt creatures; this judgment of future free actions, muſt needs be infallible, that is, as truly certain (though entirely of a different kind) as that foreknowledge which he has of neceſſary events, by ſeeing their neceſſary chain of cauſes: Nor ought it to appear ſtrange, that this divine foreknowledge of future free actions, ſhould be entirely of a different nature, from his foreknowledge of neceſſary events. For there is a not unlike diſtinction in ſome other of the divine attributes.— The omnipreſence of GOD, is an attribute neceſſarily belonging to him, and altogether independent of his will. The goodneſs of GOD is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a neceſſary attribute, yet not in the ſame manner as his omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, by a mere abſolute neceſſity of nature, but by the unalterable rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his will. This is the true reaſon why we return him thanks for being <hi>good,</hi> but not for being omnipreſent. Thus both are neceſſary, but by a neceſſity of a totally different ſort or kind. In like manner, the foreknowledge of GOD, both that of neceſſary, and that of free events, is in the iſſue of things equally certain; yet in the one caſe, this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty is entirely of a different nature from that in the other. It ariſes in the caſe of neceſſary events from GOD's own fore-appointing a neceſſary chain of cauſes to produce theſe events; but in the caſe of <hi>free</hi> events it ariſes <hi>from</hi> and depends <hi>upon</hi> the mere futurity of the things themſelves. To illuſtrate this matter by an example. That CHRIST, ſhould die for the ſins of men, GOD not only fore-knew but fore-appointed it alſo, and ſent him into the world on purpoſe for that end. That Judas ſhould betray our Savior, GOD foreknew, but did not fore-appoint it; only he choſe on purpoſe, into the number of his diſciples, one ſuch perſon, the wickedneſs of whoſe own heart, he <hi>ſaw</hi> would prompt him to accompliſh that event. That Ahab ſhould fall at Ramath-Gilead, GOD foreſaw, and fore-warned him of it; yet GOD's fore-knowledge did not make it neceſſary for him, to go up and periſh there; but the mere wickedneſs of his own will, deſpiſing the divine admonition, as it was the only cauſe of the event, ſo was it likewiſe the only ground of the fore-knowledge. And had Ahab been diſpoſed to repent at the advice of the Prophet, it was in his own power to have prevented his deſtruction; and the fore-knowledge of God, would then have been accordingly the fore-knowledge of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary event." The reader will pardon the length of the extract, when he conſiders that it could not have been ſhortened without doing injuſtice to the reaſoning of the Author.</note>.</p>

Again, that GOD, when he placed Adam on trial in the garden of Eden, and interdicted him the fruit of the tree of knowledge, knew that he would fall, and had power ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prevent it, no man diſputes; but to reaſon from thence as ſome have done, that GOD choſe he ſhould eat of that tree, or tranſgreſs; that it was a part of GOD's general ſcheme of Providence that he ſhould do ſo, that ſin was neceſſary for the good of the ſyſtem; and that this accounts for the introduction of it into the world, to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I ſay, in this manner, and to advance ſuch ſentiments; is not only a departure from, but a groſs contradiction to Scripture. By ſuch aſſertions, though made to be thought wiſer than other people, they darken and debaſe the divine character; make GOD to ſay one thing and at the ſame

time, to mean another, to chuſe what he forbids; and in ſome reſpects, to be pleaſed with what he tells us is, <hi>"the abominable thing which his ſoul hates."</hi> It makes the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive and decretive, or the ſecret and revealed will of GOD oppoſite to each other. That the fall of Adam, has been ſo over-ruled by the <hi>Great Supreme</hi> (whoſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful prerogative it is to educe good from ill) as to bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit the rational ſyſtem, and illuſtrate his own perfections, no rational man will deny. But to aſſert, that he fell in conſequence of a divine appointment or efficiency, is what no mortal has a right to do! How much better is it to think with the <hi>Aſſembly</hi> of <hi>Divines</hi> at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and ſay, "man being left to the freedom of his own will, fell from the eſtate wherein he was created, by ſinning againſt GOD."

Can it be thought reaſonable to fix on the great <hi>Judge</hi> of <hi>heaven</hi> and <hi>earth,</hi> a character, that would be diſgraceful to any of our fellow men.

Vain man would be wiſe, and he be born like the wild aſſes colt". Who can readily believe with ſuch kind of teachers, that GOD from all eternity determined to damn the greater part of mankind, or at leaſt, a very conſiderable number of them, to promote his own glory, and to exalt or increaſe the happineſs of the remainder, when he remembers that the ſcripture repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly and plainly declares, "that GOD will have all men to be ſaved and come to the knowledge of the truth<note n="(o)" place="bottom">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 4.</note>".

To ſum up the whole under this head, let us hear what the great apoſtle of the gentiles thought of ſuch kind of preaching. He reſolves for himſelf, that he would "preach Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified, not in the words of man's wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but in demonſtration of the ſpirit and of power; that the faith of his hearers might not ſtand in the wiſdom of men, but in the power of GOD<note n="(x)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Cor.</hi> ii. 2, 4, 5.</note>". Accordingly, he cautions the chriſtian Coloſians, againſt the dangerous practice of thoſe who corrupted the ſimplicity of GOD's word, by their ſophiſtical reaſonings: "Beware, ſays he, leaſt any man ſpoil you, through philoſophy and vain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after CHRIST<note n="(y)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Col.</hi> ii. 8.</note>". Finally, he directs <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> to guard with care againſt ſo dangerous a method of preaching. To <hi>Timothy</hi> he ſays, "refuſe profane and old wives fables, and exerciſe thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf rather unto godlineſs<note n="(z)" place="bottom">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> iv. 7.</note>".</p>
            <p>Again, "ſhun profane and vain babblings, for they will increaſe unto more ungodlineſs<note n="(a)" place="bottom">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 16.</note>". Fooliſhneſs and unlearned queſtions avoid, knowing that they do gender ſtrifes<note n="(b)" place="bottom">2. <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 23.</note>". Laſtly, "if any man teach otherwiſe, and conſent not to wholeſome words, even the words of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, and the doctrine that is according to godlineſs, he is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about queſtions and ſtrifes of words, whereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth ſtrife, railings, evil ſurmiſings, perverſe diſqueiting of men of corrupt minds, and deſtitute of the truth; <hi>from ſuch withdraw thyſelf</hi>
               <note n="(c)" place="bottom">1. <hi>Tim.</hi> vi. 3, 4, 5.</note>". I ſhall now in the third place enquire into the reaſons why miniſters ſometimes do not
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:017449_0017_0FA11DDFD1143910"/>
preach according to the <hi>law</hi> and <hi>teſtimony.</hi> It might be anſwered in general, that <hi>ignorance, inattention,</hi> and <hi>the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt principles of the human heart</hi> lead them aſtray. But I ſhall be more particular, and anſwer firſt, ſome perſons miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent the doctrines of revelation, through deſign, in order to accommodate themſelves to the corrupt humours of their hearers. Such is the abandoned temper of ſome teachers, that they will <hi>knowingly</hi> pervert the goſpel, that they may anſwer ſome wicked deſign, or ſecure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſome worldly emolument. Perſons that will thus conduct, are hereticks in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of the word. They are highly criminal in the ſight of GOD. To rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with ſuch men is vain; though it may be proper to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter to them, an wholeſome admonition or two. Hence ſays St. Paul, "an heretick after the firſt and ſecond ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition reject, knowing that he that is ſuch, is ſubvert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſinneth, being condemned of himſelf<note n="(d)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Tit.</hi> iii. 10.</note>". Charity obliges us to think there are but few ſuch miniſters at this day. Secondly, another reaſon why publick teachers miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent the truth, is their negligence in ſtudying the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. As the huſbandman cannot cultivate his farm with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out proper utenſils; ſo neither is the preacher properly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for his work, unleſs much acquainted which the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred <hi>code,</hi> which is the foundation of the whole of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions from the pulpit. In order to his having this acquaintance, much ſtudy is neceſſary. But as "ſtudy is a wearineſs to the fleſh<note n="(e)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Eccl.</hi> xii. 12.</note>," ſome teachers content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with a careleſs and curſory reading the ſcriptures, which is by no means ſufficient to give us a clear and comprehenſive knowledge of them. Aſſiduous applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is requiſite for this purpoſe. Different paſſages ſhould be compared with each other; the analogy of faith muſt be preſerved, a harmony maintained through the whole, and dark texts explained by thoſe that are more clear and intelligible. But alas! for want of this atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, how horribly are the ſcriptures ſometimes perverted. The preacher is carried away by mere ſounds; and ſtrains texts to ſuch unnatural ſenſes, as are not only contrary to the general ſcope of revelation, but ſtrike at the foundation of all religion. Through neglect of comparing one paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017449_0018_0FA11DE023F250F8"/>
with another; by reaſon of not attending to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral deſign of the writer, the connexion of his diſcourſe, and the thread of his reaſoning, we raiſe doctrines upon incidental looſe portions of ſcripture, which contradict it's general tenor, and countenance immorality. The miſtake occaſioned hereby, might be made evident by a variety of inſtances: I will mention a few. "Whatſoever is not of faith is ſin<note n="(f)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> xiv. 23.</note>". How often has this text been quoted to prove that whatever an unregenerate man does in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, is altogether ſin, becauſe he is deſtitute of true ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith in CHRIST? But if we carefully conſult the context, will it not clearly appear, that it has no kind of reference to this matter? On the contrary, from ſuch an examination, will it not be abundantly evident, that the reaſoning of St. Paul was only this, that with reſpect to a controverſy that ſubſiſted between the <hi>judaizing</hi> and <hi>gentile</hi> chriſtians, concerning the lawfulneſs of obſerving, or not obſerving certain days, or of eating or not eating certain meats, they ought to be fully perſuaded in their own minds, and not go contrary to the belief of them; for though it was lawful under the goſpel, to eat all kinds of wholeſome meats; yet if any man thought otherwiſe, or even doubted the lawfulneſs of particular kinds of meat, and yet eat of them, he acted a ſinful part, in going con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the light of his own mind. He that doubteth is damned, that is, condemned in his own mind, if he eat, becauſe he eateth not of faith; for whatſoever is not of faith, is ſin.</p>
            <p>Again, "whoſoever will ſave his life ſhall loſe it, and whoſoever ſhall loſe his life for my ſake, ſhall find it<note n="(g)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> xvi. 25.</note>." Has not this paſſage alſo been greatly miſrepreſented; either to ſerve a particular favorite ſcheme, or through neglect to conſult the drift of our Saviour, in the chapter where he uſes it. Multitudes are ſenſible, that it has been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten uſed in ſupport of this ſingular opinion, viz. that if a man has any deſire to ſecure his own ſalvation by any acts of obedience he performs; nay, if he is not willing to forego his final happineſs, for the glory of GOD, and of CHRIST, he certainly ſhall be damned! And yet, is it not ſufficiently evident from the connexion in which it
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017449_0019_0FA11DE0B412B428"/>
ſtands, that it means neither more nor leſs then this, that if a man through fear of temporal death, would renounce CHRIST and his goſpel, though by this means he might ſave his temporal, he ſhould certainly loſe his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life? I might eaſily point out the perverſion of many other paſſages of ſacred writ, that have been miſconſtrued, either through inattention, or to ſerve a particular turn; but the time would fail me. I ſhall only obſerve, that it cannot give us a very favorable opinion of ſentiments, or doctrines, that have no other ſupport in the bible than ſuch texts, thus groſsly miſapplied. Thirdly, Another reaſon why we do not ſpeak as the oracles of GOD, is that we come to the ſtudy of them with prejudiced minds. This is a diſadvantage we all, in a greater or leſs degree, labour under. A man totally free from prejudice, is no where to be found. There are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain principles in the human heart, which imperceptibly lead us aſtray. We are always liable to be unduly biaſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but when young, prepoſſeſſions are moſt apt to take place. The company we keep, the books we read in our juvenile years make a ſtrong impreſſion, and ſometimes ſhackle the mind in ſuch a manner, that it is with difficulty we get rid of the bias ſo long as we live. We are formed for imitation; and whilſt incapable of judging for ourſelves, we take our ſentiments from thoſe, whom from their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and characters we are led to reverence. With ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments thus previouſly imbibed, we come to the ſtudy of the ſcriptures. Therefore inſtead of enquiring impartially into the true meaning of them, with an upright deſire to be acquainted with it, our buſineſs is rather to make them an eccho to our own voice, and accommodate them in the beſt manner we can to our pre-conceived ſentiments. Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of revelation are hence tortured, wreſted from their original deſign, and made to ſpeak a language foreign from the intention of the writer.</p>
            <p>Under this head of prejudice and the evil influence it has upon us, I ſhall mention two particulars. Firſt, Some men from this cauſe are unduly fond of the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the ancients, and will not be induced to believe any thing, on which <hi>they</hi> had not put the <hi>ſtamp</hi> of <hi>ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy.</hi> Theſe people have an undue reverence for anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017449_0020_0FA11DE171EDB530"/>
"They believe that the former times were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than theſe<note n="(h)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Ecc.</hi> vii. 10.</note>; and particularly that our forefathers were the beſt and moſt perfect models; that their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples were a tranſcript of the precepts, and their belief of the doctrines of the goſpel. Though I have no diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to diſparage them in either of theſe reſpects; yet without offence I may be allowed to ſay, they were not perfect; and he that ſhall implicitly follow them either in their faith or practice, is in danger of being miſled. We ought to ſee with our own eyes, and ſearch for truth not in their fallible writings, but in the unerring pages of divine inſpiration. "We ſhould call no man maſter, or father on earth; ſince one is our maſter even CHRIST<note n="(i)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> xxiii. 8.</note>". Happy indeed are we in having the opinions of our fathers delivered down to us in <hi>creeds</hi> and <hi>formularies,</hi> provided we make a diſcreet uſe of them; but if they are ſubſcribed, and rigidly adhered to, as the ſtandard of right opinion, they are then an inſuperable bar to any improvement in divine knowledge. We do well to avail ourſelves of the writings and diſcoveries of former times; but ought not to reſt contended with any attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to which they had arrived. Modern improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been made in philoſophy, juriſprudence, &amp;c. why not in divinity? There was a contrariety of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments even among the ancients; we ought to read both ſides of the controverſy; and from their interferings, as from the colliſion of the flint and ſteel, ſhould labour to ſtrike out new light. In ſhort, a blind attachment to mere hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man creeds, hangs a dead weight upon the mind, fetters the native freedom of the ſoul, prevents our impartial enquiries, and oftentimes greatly miſleads. But, Secondly, Prejudice, in ſome perſons has a quite contrary effect, and leads on the other hand, as far from the truth of ſcripture. This is the caſe of thoſe who would be thought more penetrating and ſagacious than other people. Such perſons take no ſatisfaction in preaching that which others have preached before them. Their pride can content itſelf with nothing but what is <hi>new</hi> and <hi>ſingular.</hi> Thread bare
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017449_0021_0FA11DE2325F85E8"/>
truth they hate. New and untrodden paths <hi>only</hi> can they brook to walk in. They love to ſet the world a ſtaring by the novelty and ſtrangeneſs of their aſſertions. They love to be talked of, as men above vulgar prejudices, who act an independent part, and who think for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. To be tranſmitted down to poſterity, as the heads of a new <hi>ſect</hi> in religion, is an object ſo tempting to their vanity that they cannot reſiſt it. Now to anſwer theſe purpoſes, to gratify their vanity, and to be thought wiſer than others, it is neceſſary to ſtrike out new walks of ſcience, to broach new doctrines, and contradict the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of thoſe who have gone before them. If they think and preach like thoſe who went before them, what glory is it? But if they are the authors of new diſcoveries; if they can unravel the <hi>Gordian knot</hi>; if they can account for the introduction of ſin into the world, and explain <hi>that</hi> which has puzzled the brighteſt geniuſſes in former ages, then they anſwer their deſign, they glory in their new invented divinity; and pertinaciouſly adhere to <hi>that</hi> which ſhocks the common ſenſe of mankind in general. To ſhow that mankind have been in an error, even in the ſmalleſt matter, and to point out their miſtake, is ſome gratification to their vanity; but to prove that they have been in a miſtake in <hi>religion,</hi> which is a matter of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal concern, for eighteen hundred years paſt, affords to them matter of exultation and triumph! From ſuch a ſource as this, ſome perſons of vain and empty minds, deviate from the ſcripture, and teach for doctrines not the truths of revelation, but the dictates of their own vanity and pride.—<hi>Fourthly, and laſtly.</hi> The laſt reaſon I ſhall mention, why miniſters depart from the <hi>law</hi> and <hi>the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> is, their not ſettling before-hand juſt ſentiments of the <hi>Deity.</hi> Did we conceive of him, as we ought, as a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>truth</hi> and <hi>juſtice,</hi> of <hi>holineſs</hi> and infinite <hi>benevolence,</hi> we could not poſſibly believe that a revelation from him, could contain ſuch doctrines, as are ſometimes preached. Under the notion of exalting his ſovereignty, we ſhould by no means repreſent him as cruel and tyrannical, merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and capricious. Whether this has not been done by ſome, I leave others to judge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:017449_0022_0FA11DE2F328B9B8"/>I ſhall apply the whole that has been ſaid, to the miniſters now preſent, and to the people who hear them. Firſt, to the miniſters. You will permit me, my reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Fathers and Brethren, to obſerve that it becomes us to be very careful how we ſtudy the holy ſcriptures: with what tempers we come to the ſtudy of them. There are many principles in the human heart that may lead us inſenſibly to wreſt and pervert the ſacred oracles. We ſhould, therefore, watch over our own hearts, mortify our pride, our vanity, and every other paſſion that makes us averſe to the truth, as it is in JESUS. The prevailing temper of the heart has an amazing influence on the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the head. Thus the pride of the heart is brought with difficulty to ſubmit to ſome of the humbling doctrines of the goſpel. How hard is it to conſent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſalvation as the free gift of GOD? Again, a man of a ſelfiſh temper greatly devoid of benevolence, after having placed himſelf in the number of the elect, readily adopts the groundleſs doctrine of perſonal, unconditional reprobation; and contemplates with pleaſure the inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble damnation of millions of his fellow men; and ſo in an hundred other inſtances. It becomes us therefore, as public teachers of religion to exerciſe a godly jealouſy over ourſelves, and labour to bring with us to the ſtudy of the ſcriptures, an <hi>open, candid, meek</hi> and <hi>teachable</hi> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. "The meek GOD will guide in judgment, the meek he will teach his way<note n="(k)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxv. 9.</note>". A diſpoſition to do the will of GOD is the beſt preparative for the right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the doctrines of chriſtianity. CHRIST ſays, if any man will do his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine, whether it be of GOD, or whether I ſpeak of myſelf<note n="(l)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>John</hi> vii. 17.</note>. Accordingly ſays Daniel, "none of the wicked ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, but the wiſe ſhall underſtand<note n="(m)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Dan.</hi> xxii. 10.</note>". The pre-dominancy of luſt and paſſion ſhuts up the avenues of the ſoul, and bars the entrance of divine truth; it warps and diſtorts the mind, and leads to groſs miſconceptions. As we cannot but be ſenſible of this, it ſhould be our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant endeavour to mortify the evil propenſities of our hearts, and with meekneſs receive and diſpenſe the ingraf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted word, which is able to ſave our ſouls". It ſhould,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:017449_0023_0FA11DE3B2DFD590"/>
moreover, be our great concern to diveſt our minds of all prejudicate opinions, not firſt ſettle our ſentiments and then examine, as is too often the caſe; but examine with impartiality and care, in order to our being grounded and eſtabliſhed in the faith. And in this examination let us make the Bible the ſtandard, receiving that more than the moſt reſpectable human authority; being perſuaded that the firſt is unerring; the laſt fallible and precarious. Finally, we ſhould add our fervent addreſſes to the GOD of all grace for the illumination and guidance of his Holy Spirit, that we may be preſerved from all dangerous errors, may know the truth ourſelves, and be faithful diſpenſors of it to others; for truly dreadful is it to miſlead, either through ignorance or paſſion, thoſe <hi>who ſeek the law at our mouths.</hi> Againſt the errors of teachers there is one ſecurity, and that is, the right underſtanding of their hearers in divine things. An intelligent people are rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impoſed upon by falſe and erronious preachers. But be this as it will, certainly people are not obliged impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly to believe <hi>all</hi> that is delivered to them from the deſk. They have the Bible in their hands, written in a language which they underſtand, and by <hi>this</hi> they are to judge, whether what they hear be true or not. To you therefore who hear, I ſhall in the Second place, apply myſelf. Suffer me, my brethren to ſay, that miniſters "have no dominion over your faith, but are only helpers of your joy<note n="(n)" place="bottom">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> i. 24.</note>". You have not only a <hi>right,</hi> but it is your <hi>duty</hi> to judge for yourſelves. "Prove all things, hold faſt that which is good." "Believe not every ſpirit, but try the ſpirits whether they are of GOD; becauſe many falſe prophets are gone out into the world." It was the commendation of the <hi>Bereans,</hi> that they ſearched the ſcriptures <hi>daily,</hi> to ſee whether the things ſpoken by the apoſtles, were ſo or not. It muſt be equally to the praiſe of any other people, if they ſee with their own eyes, and compare the doctrines that are delivered to them from time to time, with the Bible, the only unerring ſtandard. Implicit faith is degrading to the human mind. It argues a baſe and ſervile temper. Hence, ſearching the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to put us into a capacity to judge of the ſentiments
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:017449_0024_0FA11DE471FE37C0"/>
that are advanced to us by our teachers, is a mark of a noble and ingenuous ſoul, that will not be hood-winked or ſhackled by authority. I ſay not this to excite a <hi>carp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, captious</hi> ſpirit in hearers, of which there is full enough at preſent; but only to influence to a <hi>rational, diligent</hi> and <hi>manly</hi> examination of the word of GOD; and to enable them to ſee when the ſpirit of the goſpel is preached, or contradicted by their miniſters. To enable you to make this examination to any valuable purpoſe, ſeveral things are neceſſary. Firſt, a good and an honeſt heart, diſpoſed to keep the divine commands, will give you great inſight into the will of GOD. <hi>David</hi> could ſay, I "have more underſtanding than all my teachers; for thy teſtimonies are my meditation; I underſtand more than the ancients, becauſe I keep thy precepts<note n="(o)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> cxix. 99, 100.</note>". Secondly, It will be a mighty help to you in the underſtanding of ſcripture in the dark and myſterious parts thereof, to ſettle and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain in your minds right conceptions of the divine character. Thirdly, Remember that revelation was given not to introduce ſpeculative and curious opinions into the world, but to rectify the diſorders, and better the temper of the human heart. Fouthly, Lay it down as a maxim, that no doctrines can come from GOD, a being of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite purity and holineſs, which in the leaſt degree tolerate or tend to encourage <hi>vice</hi> and <hi>immorality.</hi> Fifthly, That revelation is founded in <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>common ſenſe,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that none of its doctrines can contradict either the one or the other; however, ſome of them may be above our comprehenſion. <hi>That</hi> people who ſhall attentively ſtudy the ſcripture agreeably to the rules and directions laid down in this diſcourſe, will be out of all danger of being carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the ſlight of men, and cunning craftineſs whereby they lie in wait to deceive<note n="(p)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Epheſ.</hi> vi. 14.</note>". I am conſtrained to add, that a people well acquainted with the revealed will of GOD, will not eaſily digeſt, or be reconciled to certain doctrines that have been propagated late in <hi>ſome</hi> of our <hi>Pariſhes.</hi> The <hi>Pastors and Deacons,</hi> who have in this place taken much pains to become acquainted with the religious

ſentiments of the Rev. Mr. SCRIBNER; are, in general fully perſuaded that he has either <hi>publickly</hi> or <hi>privately</hi> advanced ſome ſentiments, not only unſupported by ſcripture, but alſo of a dangerous nature, and tendency. In particular, they conceive that he is dangerouſly erronious in the two following points. Firſt, in what he has ſaid concerning ſin's being the object of GOD's choice, and agreeable to his will. And Secondly, in ſaying that the <hi>unregenerate</hi> have no right to attend the <hi>means of grace</hi>: Notwithſtanding Mr. SCRIBNER'S explanations or ſoftenings of theſe heads, yet it finally did appear, that the ſentiments he advanced, relative to the above particulars, were ſuch, as not only could not be defended, but were really contrary to the very ſpirit and genius of chriſtianity.—It muſt be thought a matter of the higheſt importance, to entertain right conceptions of the deity. We are taught to conceive of him as a being of infinite purity and holineſs; but if ſin, in any view of it be agreeable to him; if it was introduced into the world, by his influence, efficiency or creation, how can we recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile this with his <hi>juſtice,</hi> purity and holineſs? How can we reconcile it with his juſtice to puniſh <hi>that</hi> in his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which they did through his efficiency, and in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of his own will? How, with his holineſs to create, or effect, to will or chooſe <hi>that</hi> which is directly contrary to holineſs? The diſtinctions that have been made in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to this ſubject, appear to be altogether futile; ſuch as that, <hi>the ſinfulneſs of ſin, and ſin in its own nature,</hi> are diſpleaſing to GOD. Do not theſe expreſſions imply that there is a kind of holineſs, or goodneſs in ſin; and that ſin out of it's own nature, is the object of GOD's choice? To introduce ſuch uncouth phraſeology into popular ſermons; to deſturb the natural ideas that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind have of GOD, to diſtinguiſh and ſubtilize beyond the limits of common ſenſe, muſt certainly be a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable way, a very dangerous method of preaching. But it will be ſaid, that the ſcripture repreſents GOD as encouraging and promoting ſin. I muſt confeſs there are many paſſages which ſeem to countenance the very ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I am now exploding. Thus we read that GOD.

Now, how are theſe texts to be explained, on any other ſuppoſition, than that of GOD's being the author or efficient cauſe of ſin? I anſwer; that as GOD's providence over-rules, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intends all things; as from him we derived all our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and faculties both natural and moral; and in him, <hi>live, move, and have our being</hi>; and finally, as without theſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, we could do neither good nor evil actions; hence in a figurative, and leſs proper ſenſe, he is ſaid to be the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor or cauſe of the ſinful actions and violitions of men even when nothing more is intended, then that he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them ſo to do; that he upheld their lives and faculties by which they were enabled to commit ſin; that he put them into ſuch circumſtances, as fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in with their corrupt tempers, made them tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; withdrew his grace from them, left them for their former provocations, to their own obſtinacy and blindneſs; and gave them up to ſatan, to be tempted by him. That this is the meaning of the above quoted ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that they do not intend that GOD makes men wicked by his own poſitive influence, muſt be evident from what is ſaid in other parts of the <hi>bible.</hi> Thus, what is figuratively ſaid to be done by GOD, 2. Samuel xxiv. 1ſt. is, with greater accuracy of expreſſion, attributed to ſatan, 1ſt. Chronicles xxi. And ſatan ſtood up againſt <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and provoked <hi>David</hi> to number <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, St. <hi>Peter</hi> ſays to <hi>Ananias,</hi> why hath <hi>ſatan</hi> (not why hath GOD) filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghoſt<note n="(w)" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> v. 3.</note>." But what puts this matter beyond all doubt, is the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of St. <hi>James,</hi> on this very head. "Let no man ſay, when he is tempted, I am tempted of GOD; for GOD cannot be tempted of evil; neither tempteth he any man: But every man is tempted when he is drawn

Secondly, The other article condemned by the <hi>conference</hi> is this, "it is not the duty, nay; the unregenerate have no right to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble with GOD's people, or to attend the means of grace." The greater part of mankind, is ſhocked at ſuch a ſentiment as this. Can ſuch an opinion be poſſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from ſcripture? Nay, does it not contradict the general tenor of the Bible? were not the means of grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for the purpoſe of bringing men home to CHRIST? Does not our adorable Saviour ſay, "I came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance<note n="(y)" place="bottom">

What then can thoſe men mean, who ſay that ſinners have no right to aſſemble with GOD's people, to read, pray, &amp;c?</p>
            <p>Is not this <hi>laying the ax at the root of the tree</hi> of virtue? Is it not to encourage ſin and licentiouſneſs with a witneſs? What? ſhall they forbid the greater part of mankind the hearing the preached goſpel? If they thus turn men out of the ſynagogue, we may expect ſoon to hear that they have no right to breathe, and that ſome fanaticks will kill them, under a notion of, "doing GOD ſervice<note n="(a)" place="bottom">

Can any man, on the contrary, believe it more rational to direct them <hi>not to aſk for faith till they have received it, not to ſeek till they have found; not to knock till it is opened to them.</hi> This, methinks, is abſurd, contrary to the ſenſe of mankind in general, as well as to the true meaning of ſcripture.— To be ſure, CHRIST did not treat ſinners under conviction in this manner, "He did not break the bruiſed reed, nor quench the ſmoaking flax," but encouraged the ſmalleſt beginnings of goodneſs, <hi>till he ſent forth judgment unto victory,</hi> or, till conviction ended in converſion. How dreadful is a contrary ſentiment, which diſcourages endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and is promotive of vice! Attending the means of grace, if it does not terminate in converſion, has a mighty tendency to keep the conſcience tender, and reſtrain from a multitude of ſins unto which otherwiſe, we ſhould be apt to ruſh<note n="(f)" place="bottom">Pertinent is the account that was lately tranſmitted to me by the Rev. Mr. MACCARTY of Worceſter, and the Rev. Mr. WHITNEY of Northborough, under their hands. Theſe gentlemen went to viſit young ROSS, who was in priſon, under ſentence of death, for being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate with others, in the murder of Mr. SPOONER, of Brook-field. After giving him ſome advice and directions what to do in his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and particularly urging him to the duty of prayer, he ſays, "I like your advice and thank you for it, but it brings to my mind ſomething very different, which I heard not long ago from the pulpit. A young gentleman, preaching for the miniſter, where I uſed to attend publick wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſaid, in the courſe of his ſermon, that it was not a duty, or rather, it was a ſin for an unregenerate man to pray. Before this I was ſtirred up to ſecret prayer at times; and thought it my duty; but hearing that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence from the deſk, cauſed me to lay aſide ſecret prayer, and I have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to think my neglect of that duty, a great cauſe of my failing into thoſe ſins which have brought me into this place, and ſituation, and for which I muſt ſoon ſuffer death." He ſaid the preachers name was LITCHFIELD.</note>.</p>
            <p>To conclude. Brethren and Friends of this Church and Town, we heartly lament your unhappy diviſions, together with the occaſion of them. We ſincerely wiſh both miniſter and people well. May GOD enlighten you into the knowledge of all neceſſary truth; and diveſt your minds of all undue prejudices. May thoſe doctrines
